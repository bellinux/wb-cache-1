The early researchers were very aware of the goal of building climate models which could integrate our knowledge of complex physical interactions between atmospheric, land-vegetation, hydrology, ocean, <b>cryospheric</b> <b>processes,</b> and sea ice. The transition from climate models to earth system models is already underway with coupling of active biochemical cycles. Progress is limited by present computer capability which is needed for increasingly more complex and higher resolution climate models versions. It {{would be a mistake to}} make models too complex or too high resolution. Arriving at a “feasible ” and useful model is the challenge for the climate model community.

40|$|The Antarctic {{intermediate}} {{and deep}} water masses {{present in the}} Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean were quantified through the inverse method known as Optimum Multiparameter (OMP) analysis. The method {{was applied to the}} Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) product, which assimilates real observed ocean data into a hydrodynamic model. Results here show that the SODA dataset is able to capture reasonably well the intermediate and deep water mass (i. e. Warm Deep Water, Weddell Sea Deep Water, Weddell Sea Bottom Water, and Circumpolar Deep Water) regional distribution and contribution to the total mixture in the Weddell Sea and Weddell-Scotia Confluence. Those regions are, respectively, the main Antarctic Bottom Water source and export areas to the global ocean. We infer some aspects of the ocean circulation from the water mass distribution obtained. However, some efforts are still needed to better represent the deep salinity in these areas. The weak representation of this hydrographic parameter could be associated with the model’s lack of important <b>cryospheric</b> <b>processes</b> directly involved with bottom water formation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{importance}} {{of snow and}} related <b>cryospheric</b> <b>processes</b> as an ecological factor has been recognized {{since at least the}} beginning of the twentieth century. Even today, however, many observations remain anecdotal. The research to date on cold-lands ecosystems results in scientists being unable to evaluate to what extent changes in the cryosphere will be characterized by abrupt changes in local and global biogeochemical cycles, and how these changes in seasonality may affect the rates and timing of key ecological processes. Studies of gas exchanges through snow have revealed that snow plays an important role in modulating wintertime soil biogeochemical processes, and that these can be the driving processes for gas exchange at the snow surface. Previous research has primarily focused on carbon dioxide, and resulted from episodic experiments at a number of snow-covered sites. Here we report new insights from several field sites on Niwot Ridge in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, including a dedicated snow gas flux research facility established at the 3340 m Soddie site.

It spans the satellite observing era from 1980 to the present.

As the hydrology of Arctic river basins is dominated by <b>cryospheric</b> <b>processes</b> such as snow accumulation and snowmelt, it may also be highly sensitive to a change in climate. Estimating the water balance of these river basins is therefore important, but it is complicated by the sparseness of observations and the large uncertainties related to the measurement of snowfalls. This study aims at simulating the water balance of the Barents Sea drainage basin in Northern Europe under present and future climate conditions. We used a regional climate model to drive a large-scale hydrological model of the area. Using simulated precipitation derived from a climate model led to an overestimation of the annual discharge in most river basins, but not in all. Under the B 2 scenario of climate change, the model simulated a 25 % increase in freshwater runoff, which is proportionally larger than the projected precipitation increase. As the snow season is 30 to 50 day shorter, the spring discharge peak is shifted by about two to three weeks, but the hydrological regime of the rivers remains dominated by snowmelt. JRC.

40|$|Changes in the Arctic's climate are {{a result}} of complex {{interactions}} between the cryosphere, atmosphere, ocean, and biosphere. More feedbacks from the cryosphere to climate warming are positive and result in further warming than are negative, resulting in a reduced rate of warming or cooling. Feedbacks operate at different spatial scales; many, such as those operating through albedo and evapotranspiration, will have significant local effects that together could result in global impacts. Some processes, such as changes in carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, are likely to have very small global effects but uncertainty is high whereas others, such as subsea methane (CH 4) emissions, could have large global effects. Some <b>cryospheric</b> <b>processes</b> in the Arctic have teleconnections with other regions and major changes in the cryosphere have been largely a result of large-scale processes, particularly atmospheric and oceanic circulation. With continued climate warming it is highly likely that the cryospheric components will play an increasingly important climatic role. However, the net effect of all the feedbacks is difficult to assess because of the variability in spatial and temporal scales over which they operate. Furthermore, general circulation models (GCMs) do not include all major feedbacks while those included may not be accurately parameterized.

40|$|This paper quantifies the {{potential}} influence of sediment compaction on {{the magnitude of}} nineteenth and twentieth century sea-level rise, as reconstructed from salt marsh sediments. We firstly develop a database of the physical and compression properties of low energy intertidal and salt marsh sediments. Key compression parameters are controlled by organic content (loss on ignition), though compressibility is modulated by local-scale processes, notably {{the potential}} for desiccation of sediments. Using this database and standard geotechnical theory, we use a numerical modelling approach to generate and subsequently ‘decompact’ a range of idealised intertidal stratigraphies. We find that compression can significantly contribute to reconstructed accelerations in recent sea level, notably in transgressive stratigraphies. The magnitude of this effect can be sufficient to add between 0. 1 and 0. 4 mm yr− 1 of local sea-level rise, depending on {{the thickness of the}} stratigraphic column. In contrast, records from shallow (< 0. 5 m) uniform-lithology stratigraphies, or shallow near-surface salt marsh deposits in regressive successions, experience negligible compaction. Spatial variations in compression could be interpreted as ‘sea-level fingerprints’ that might, in turn, be wrongly attributed to oceanic or <b>cryospheric</b> <b>processes.</b> However, consideration of existing sea-level records suggests {{that this is not the}} case and that compaction cannot be invoked as the sole cause of recent accelerations in sea level inferred from salt marsh sediments...|$|R
40|$|Space-borne {{remotely}} sensed {{data can}} provide valuable insight into <b>cryospheric</b> <b>processes</b> in remote high-latitude regions for which direct observations are limited. In {{this study we}} use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Landsat imagery to evaluate recent changes in the ice cover of Upper and Lower Murray Lakes (81 ° 20 ′N, 69 ° 30 ′W) on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada. These data highlight changes in ice conditions that have occurred {{over the past decade}} and provide a means for assessing the likely impacts of rising temperatures on future lake-ice conditions. Under current (1997 – 2007) climatic conditions the Murray Lakes average several weeks of ice-free conditions in August and early September, although in some years a partial ice cover persists throughout the year. The observed relationship between summer temperature and ice melt at Upper and Lower Murray Lakes suggests that recent warming in the High Arctic has forced the lakes near a threshold from a state characterized by perennial ice cover to the current state that includes seasonal melting of lake ice. Projected future warming will significantly increase the duration of ice free conditions on Upper and Lower Murray Lakes, with ice-out predicted to occur 13. 5 ± 4. 0 and 17. 6 ± 5. 6 days earlier, respectively, for every 1 °C increase in mean June–July temperature...|$|R
40|$|Orogenic {{areas are}} subject to uplift and {{horizontal}} deformation as observed by present-day global positioning system and repeated leveling measurements. Crustal mass is conservative and less dense than the mantle, thus the horizontal shortening {{must be accompanied by}} crustal thickening and horizontal extrusion. According to the level of isostatic compensation, the thickening is partitioned into topographic uplift and Moho deepening. We investigate the mass change induced gravity signal and discuss whether this signal could be detected using terrestrial or satellite gravity observations. An example is the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, for which we model crustal thickening and calculate the expected gravity signal. The predictions are compared with present-day gravity changes observed by GRACE and with published in situ absolute gravity rates. It is found that the crustal thickening signal cannot be neglected and that it contributes significantly to the observed signal. Those studies with focus on the glacier and hydrologic mass fluxes should be aware that, if neglected, the crustal signal could introduce a significant bias. The GRACE observations give a positive gravity rate over central Tibetan Plateau, unexplained by the hydrologic or cryospheric signals, and a negative rate over the Himalayas and at its foothill, which is attributable to a prolonged hydrologic drought and/or depletion of groundwater. Our model shows that the positive gravity rate could be explained by elevation uplift, and a stable or upwelling Moho. The negative gravity change signal is due primarily to the strong elevation-gradient at the foothill of the Himalayas, and to an uplift accompanied by crustal thickening and Moho lowering.

40|$|A {{large number}} of Himalayan glacier {{catchments}} are {{under the influence of}} humid climate with snowfall in winter (November–April) and south-west monsoon in summer (June–September) dominating the regional hydrology. Such catchments are defined as "Himalayan catchment", where the glacier meltwater contributes to the river flow during the period of annual high flows produced by the monsoon. The winter snow dominated Alpine catchments of the Kashmir and Karakoram region and cold-arid regions of the Ladakh mountain range are the other major glacio-hydrological regimes identified in the region. Factors influencing the river flow variations in a "Himalayan catchment" were studied in a micro-scale glacier catchment in the Garhwal Himalaya, covering an area of 77. 8 km 2 . Three hydrometric stations were established at different altitudes along the Din Gad stream and discharge was monitored during the summer ablation period from 1998 to 2004, with an exception in 2002. These data have been analysed along with winter/summer precipitation, temperature and mass balance data of the Dokriani glacier to study the role of glacier and precipitation in determining runoff variations along the stream continuum from the glacier snout to 2360 m a. s. l. The study shows that the inter-annual runoff variation in a "Himalayan catchment" is linked with precipitation rather than mass balance changes of the glacier. This study also indicates that the warming induced an initial increase of glacier runoff and subsequent decline as suggested by the IPCC (2007) is restricted to the glacier degradation-derived component in a precipitation dominant Himalayan catchment and cannot be translated as river flow response. The preliminary assessment suggests that the "Himalayan catchment" could experience higher river flows and positive glacier mass balance regime together in association with strong monsoon. The important role of glaciers in this precipitation dominant system is to augment stream runoff during the years of low summer discharge. This paper intends to highlight the importance of creating credible knowledge on the Himalayan <b>cryospheric</b> <b>processes</b> to develop a more representative global view on river flow response to cryospheric changes and locally sustainable water resources management strategies...|$|R
40|$|The Tibetan Plateau {{is one of}} {{the most}} geologically dynamic systems and the highest plateau in the world with ongoing {{three-dimensional}} crustal deformation. The Plateau is uplifting and deforming horizontally as observed by present-day global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and repeated leveling measurements. Crustal mass is conservative and less dense than the mantle, thus the horizontal shortening must be accompanied by crustal thickening and horizontal extrusion. According to the level of isostatic compensation, the thickening is partitioned into topographic uplift and Moho deepening. Here, we investigate the mass change induced gravity signal observed at or near the crust, and discuss whether this signal could be detected using terrestrial or satellite gravity observations. We set up a model for the Tibetan Plateau crustal thickening and calculate the expected gravity signal. The predictions are then compared with the present-day gravity changes observed by GRACE and with published in situ absolute gravity rates. We conclude that the crustal thickening signal cannot be neglected and that it contributes significantly to the observed signal. Those studies with focus on the mountain glacier and hydrologic mass fluxes should be aware that, if neglected, the crustal signal could introduce a significant bias. The observations give a positive gravity rate over central Tibetan Plateau, unexplained by the hydrologic or cryospheric signals, and a negative rate over the Himalayas and at its foothill, which is attributable to terrestrial hydrologic signals including human depletion of groundwater. Our model shows that the positive gravity rate could be explained by elevation uplift, and a stable or upwelling Moho. The negative gravity change signal is due primarily to the strong elevation-gradient at the foothill of the Himalayas, and to an uplift accompanied by crustal thickening and Moho lowering. The estimated gravity rates can be used when defining the requirements on future gravity missions, as the tectonic signal should be resolved in order to improve its separation from hydrologic and/or <b>cryospheric</b> <b>processes</b> generating a gravity change...|$|R

40|$|Session description: Both the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and the IPCC Working Group 1 (Fourth Assessment Report) {{recognize}} the cryosphere {{as one of}} the most significant challenges of climate science and as a major source of uncertainty in global climate projections. While the permafrost carbon feedback has been identified as potentially the largest terrestrial feedback to anthropogenic climate change and the most likely to occur, significant knowledge gaps remain related to the impact of thawing permafrost on the global carbon cycle. This uncertainty includes the magnitude, type, and timing of greenhouse gas emissions from thawing permafrost. Degradation of permafrost also has transformative local impacts on aquatic and terrestrial species and ecosystems. These changes together with the direct effects of permafrost degradation on human infrastructure connect this issue with human population living in the permafrost region and around the globe. WCRP actively promotes targeted research activities aimed at improving our understanding of <b>cryospheric</b> <b>processes</b> and our ability to make quantitative predictions and long term projections to provide better quantitative understanding of processes involved in cryosphere-climate interactions, particularly with respect to terrestrial and sub-sea permafrost. The workshop we are proposing will be organized by the Permafrost Young Researchers Network (PYRN) with the goals of: 1. Equipping young researchers with a multidisciplinary understanding of the role of permafrost in the climate system, 2. Strengthening international collaboration of early career researchers, and 3. Enabling the participants to put their research into a larger context. The workshop would fulfill these goals through a series of presentations and discussions, interactions with peers and top level permafrost researchers, and reference materials prepared for the workshop. Aim The objective of the course is to revise recent methods for the study of permafrost in a changing climate. People attending the workshop will learn about the effect of permafrost development and degradation in polar and mountain regions, and its impact on infrastructures and ecosystems under climate warming scenarios.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} drawn {{attention}} to substantial hydrological {{changes taking place}} in mountainous watersheds where hydrology is dominated by <b>cryospheric</b> <b>processes.</b> Modelling is an important tool for understanding these changes but is particularly challenging in mountainous terrain owing to scarcity of ground observations and uncertainty of model parameters across space and time. This study utilizes a Markov Chain Monte Carlo data assimilation approach to examine and evaluate the performance of a conceptual, degree-day snowmelt runoff model applied in the Tamor River basin in the eastern Nepalese Himalaya. The snowmelt runoff model is calibrated using daily streamflow from 2002 to 2006 with fairly high accuracy (average Nash-Sutcliffe metric approx. 0. 84, annual volume bias < 3 %). The Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach constrains the parameters to which the model is most sensitive (e. g. lapse rate and recession coefficient) and maximizes model fit and performance. Model simulated streamflow using an interpolated precipitation data set decreases the fractional contribution from rainfall compared with simulations using observed station precipitation. The average snowmelt contribution to total runoff in the Tamor River basin for the 2002 - 2006 period is estimated to be 29. 7 +/- 2. 9 % (which includes 4. 2 +/- 0. 9 % from snowfall that promptly melts), whereas 70. 3 +/- 2. 6 % is attributed to contributions from rainfall. On average, the elevation zone in the 4000 - 5500 m range contributes the most to basin runoff, averaging 56. 9 +/- 3. 6 % of all snowmelt input and 28. 9 +/- 1. 1 % of all rainfall input to runoff. Model simulated streamflow using an interpolated precipitation data set decreases the fractional contribution from rainfall versus snowmelt compared with simulations using observed station precipitation. Model experiments indicate that the hydrograph itself does not constrain estimates of snowmelt versus rainfall contributions to total outflow but that this derives from the degree-day melting model. Lastly, we demonstrate that the data assimilation approach is useful for quantifying and reducing uncertainty related to model parameters and thus provides uncertainty bounds on snowmelt and rainfall contributions in such mountainous watersheds...|$|R
40|$|High-latitude {{regions are}} {{particularly}} sensitive {{to climate change}} through positive feedbacks linked with <b>cryospheric</b> <b>processes</b> and further exert a significant influence on the global climate system. Long term records of natural climate variability are essential to give context to potential future climatic scenarios and to put them into perspective. Sediments from Harding Lake in the interior and Burial Lake in northwest Alaska were used to reconstruct lake-levels and paleoenvironmental conditions spanning the Last Glacial Maximum using {{a detailed analysis of}} core sedimentology and a multiproxy geochemical approach. Relatively high lake-levels during late Marine Isotope Stage 3 are followed by extremely arid and windy conditions evinced from very low lake-levels during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Ameliorating climate conditions and rising lake-levels commence by 19, 600 cal yr BP at Burial Lake and by 15, 700 cal yr BP at Harding Lake. Holocene hydroclimate conditions are broadly characterized by high and stable lake-levels along with variable levels of terrestrial and aquatic productivity. Major climatic transitions in Alaska coincide with changes in summer insolation, Laurentide Ice Sheet extent, eustatic sea level, and related changes in paleogeography. Millennial variations in aquatic productivity at Burial Lake occur over the last 10, 000 cal yr BP, which are related to changes in the duration of the ice-free season and the availability of limiting nutrients. Productivity variations coincide with changes in the mean-state Arctic Oscillation on millennial time scales, suggesting the millennial variations are driven by an internal forcing mechanism related to an ocean-atmosphere interaction. Sediments from Cheeseman Lake in Newfoundland were used to reconstruct hydroclimate variability using the oxygen isotopic composition of authigenic carbonates (δ 18 O). Increasing δ 18 O values from 10, 200 to 7, 950 cal yr BP reflect warming temperatures that are superimposed by abrupt negative δ 18 O shifts at 9, 700 and 8, 500 cal yr BP from short lived cooling events. Decreasing δ 18 O values after 7, 950 to 1, 200 cal yr BP indicate a cooling trend consistent with declining insolation, cooling surface temperatures, and a cooling trend inferred from Greenland ice cores. The results highlight the sensitivity of Newfoundland climate to ocean-atmosphere interactions on century to orbital time scales...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} observe and {{understand}} the Arctic Ocean and its response to climate change, the traditional approach of acquiring observations when and where the Arctic is accessible has to be enhanced with multi-faceted measurement systems operating autonomously to provide year-round information in real time. The major goal of such a network of autonomous sensors is to measure and monitor physical, chemical and biological parameters in the atmosphere, sea ice and ocean on at least daily intervals. Our vision for a basin-scale system follows recommendations put forward in several community reports and white papers [see references] that highlight a mix of shelf, continental slope and deep ocean observatories, drifting buoys, floats and mobile vehicles. These observational assets should be configured to monitor changes in ocean and sea ice volume and heat and fresh water content over the continental slope regions and deep Arctic, and observe the heat and fresh water fluxes through ocean straits and openings connecting to the south.

40|$|The {{temperature}} of 0 °C, the phase change point of water-ice, {{is among the}} most influential factors on the hydrology of the temperate regions that experience winter. Many <b>cryospheric</b> <b>processes,</b> such as snow and ice melt, avalanches, freshwater ice breakup, and ice jam floods, are triggered by the arrival of the above- 0 °C air temperatures. Moreover, such 0 °C based changes can have significant cascading impacts on other parts of the physical environment as well as related socio-economic activities. This research adopts an extensive analytical approach to examine the changes in the sign of mean JFM (January-February-March) and MAM (March-April-May) air temperatures, in the 0. 5 ° × 0. 5 ° land grid cells of the Northern Hemisphere (20. 25 °N- 89. 75 °N), during the period 1901 - 2009. The goal is to identify grid cells in which JFM or MAM temperatures used to be primarily below freezing, however, changed sign permanently some time during 1901 - 2009 due to an advancement in the arrival timing of the annual above- 0 °C temperature. Considering that air temperature fluctuates and can cross 0 °C several times during the entire period of study, four different modelling techniques are employed to detect the shift points in the trend function as well as mean level of the time series and to determine the year when the model rises above 0 °C (y₀) in a given location. Model-specific criteria are set to determine y₀ in cases of multiple positive 0 °C crossings. The techniques applied include i) trend shift detection techniques: Model 2 and Model 3 (Perron and Yabu, 2009 b; Kim and Perron, 2009), ii) Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (Friedman, 1991), and iii) the R method (Rodionov, 2004, 2006). This thesis provides a thorough discussion of these techniques and reviews their strengths and weaknesses relative to the research goals. In addition to y₀, the time of the onset of warming that causes a time series to permanently rise above 0 °C (y_w) is identified. The applied methods divide the entire domain of the time series into sub-regions in which the data are approximated by polynomials of degree zero or one. The segment which encompasses y₀ is termed the 'segment of interest' (S_interest). The combination of S_interest and the segment(s) with positive slope that immediately follows S_interest forms a section referred to as the 'section of total warming' (S_W_total). The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test, following the modified trend-free pre-whitening approach (Burn et al., 2004), is conducted to examine if the warming during S_interest, which causes the temperature to turn positive, is significant. The same test is applied to S_W_total to determine if the total warming subsequent to y_w is significant. Only the locations with significant warming during S_interest and S_W_total are selected. A bootstrap analysis (Cunderlik and Burn, 2002), conducted to determine the field significance of the results, indicates that local trends are also globally significant.  A thorough comparative evaluation of all the above-mentioned techniques determines that Model 2 is the technique that best meets the analysis goals. Analytical results indicate that during JFM, y₀ most commonly takes place in the following zones (referred to as 'transition area'). It should be noted that only the grid cells with significant warming during S_interest and S_W_total are considered: i) North America, western U. S; ii) Europe, highest density in central Europe; iii) southwestern and central Asia, a small region consisting of some parts of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Iran; iv) central-eastern Asia, a small area in western China most of which lies in the Taklamakan Desert; v) easternmost Asia, some grid cells from east-central China, South Korea, and Japan. During MAM, over North America, the transition area of Model 2 is principally located in Canada and extends from northeastern British Columbia to the Atlantic regions. In Eurasia, northern Europe, European Russia, southern Russia, northern Mongolia, and northeastern China form the great portion of the transition area. It should be noted that except for a few high-elevation regions located in lower latitudes, the grid cells with y₀ taking place during MAM are located north of those with y₀ occurring during JFM. Results also indicate that y₀ of the majority of locations occurs during the 1960 - 2008 interval. During MAM, the transition area of Model 2 in east-central Canada and Eurasia exhibits a clear pattern of increase in y₀ values with latitude. This characteristic is also observed in some regions during JFM. The y_w values are most commonly distributed over the period 1901 - 1980 with a peak during 1960 - 1980. The rate of warming over S_interest and S_W_total generated by Model 2 is 0. 01 - 0. 1 (°C/year). The spatial and temporal variability in the results is believed to be related to variations in climate, elevation effects, and/or large-scale atmosphere and ocean circulations, all of which require further evaluation for proper attribution of effects...|$|R
40|$|The Anthropocene is {{proposed}} {{as a new}} interval of geological time in which human influence on Earth and its geological record dominates over natural processes. A major challenge in demarcating the Anthropocene is that the balance between human-influenced and natural processes varies over spatial and temporal scales owing to the inherent variability of both human activities (as associated with culture and modes of development) and natural drivers (e. g. tectonic activity and sea level variation). Against this backdrop, we consider how geomorphology might contribute towards the Anthropocene debate by focusing on human impact on aeolian, fluvial, <b>cryospheric</b> and coastal <b>process</b> domains, and how evidence of this impact is preserved in landforms and sedimentary records. We also consider the evidence for an explicitly anthropogenic geomorphology that includes artificial slopes and other human-created landforms. This provides the basis for discussing the theoretical and practical contributions that geomorphology can make to defining an Anthropocene stratigraphy. It {{is clear that the}} relevance of the Anthropocene concept varies considerably amongst different branches of geomorphology, depending on the history of human actions in different process domains. For example, evidence of human dominance is more widespread in fluvial and coastal records than in aeolian and cryospheric records, so geomorphologically the Anthropocene would inevitably comprise a highly diachronous lower boundary. Even to identify this lower boundary, research would need to focus on the disambiguation of human effects on geomorphological and sedimentological signatures. This would require robust data, derived from a combination of modelling and new empirical work rather than an arbitrary ?war of possible boundaries' associated with convenient, but disputed, ?golden? spikes. Rather than being drawn into stratigraphical debates, the primary concern of geomorphology should be with the investigation of processes and landform development, so providing the underpinning science for the study of this time of critical geological transition.

40|$|Ocean mass {{variability}} on timescales {{of months}} to decades is still insufficiently understood. On these timescales, large-scale ocean bottom pressure (OBP) anomalies are associated both with wind induced variability {{as well as}} baroclinic processes, i. e. related to vertical shear of ocean density. The GRACE mission {{has been instrumental in}} quantifying such mass fluctuations, yet its lifetime is limited. The broader importance of non-tidal ocean mass variability for oceanography but also geodesy (i. e. for understanding the time-varying geoid, shape of the Earth's crust, centre of figure, Earth rotation) is obvious. Deep ocean processes can only be understood properly when not only sea surface height and upper ocean steric expansion are measured but deep ocean pressure anomalies are accounted for in addition. Apart from GRACE, the SWARM constellation may provide information on the lowest degrees of the time-variable gravity field of the Earth and therefore of large-scale oceanic processes. Here we introduce the project CONTIM, which is run in the framework of the German Special Priority Programme "Dynamic Earth" (SPP 1788). In CONTIM we propose to combine expertise on precise satellite orbit determination, gravity field and mass modelling, and physical oceanography to retrieve, analyse and verify consistent time series of ocean mass variations from a set of low-flying Earth orbiters including GRACE, but extending the GRACE time series. This information is used to advance our understanding of oceanic movement, ocean warming and sea level rise. CONTIM will thus synergistically address three areas: (1) the methodology of precisely determining LEO orbits, applied here to the SWARM constellation. (2) a new method of retrieving large-scale time-varying gravity (TVG) and mass change associated with oceanic (and <b>cryospheric</b> and hydrological) <b>processes</b> from results of (1), based on forward modelling. (3) physical modelling of ocean mass variations, both for improved forward modelling in (2) and for integration with satellite-geodetic retrieved ocean mass, and aiding in the determination of a final consistent modelling of sea level rise, ocean warming and oceanic mass budget. In this contribution, we will give an overview of the objectives of the project and provide some first results. We will highlight the technical challenges associated with the computation of kinematic SWARM orbits. Furthermore, different scenarios for time-variable gravity field retrieval are tested and evaluated, and the CHAMP data are used to test the methods over a longer period. To better understand and parameterize the ocean mass signals, we will discuss output from a high resolution version of the ocean model FESOM forced with tides, surface winds and atmospheric pressure...|$|R
40|$|The {{impending}} {{threat of}} global climate change and its regional manifestations is among the most important and urgent problems facing humanity. Society needs accurate and reliable estimates of changes in the probability of regional weather variations to develop science-based adaptation and mitigation strategies. Recent advances in weather prediction and in our understanding and ability to model the climate system suggest that it is both necessary and possible to revolutionize climate prediction to meet these societal needs. However, the scientific workforce and the computational capability required to bring about such a revolution is not available in any single nation. Motivated by the success of internationally funded infrastructure in other areas of science, this paper argues that, because of the complexity of the climate system, and because the regional manifestations of climate change are mainly through changes in the statistics of regional weather variations, the scientific and computational requirements to predict its behavior reliably are so enormous that {{the nations of the world}} should create a small number of multinational high-performance computing facilities dedicated to the grand challenges of developing the capabilities to predict climate variability and change on both global and regional scales over the coming decades. Such facilities will play a key role in the development of next-generation climate models, build global capacity in climate research, nurture a highly trained workforce, and engage the global user community, policy-makers, and stakeholders. We recommend the creation of a small number of multinational facilities with computer capability at each facility of about 20 peta-flops in the near term, about 200 petaflops within five years, and 1 exaflop by the end of the next decade. Each facility should have sufficient scientific workforce to develop and maintain the software and data analysis infrastructure. Such facilities will enable questions of what resolution, both horizontal and vertical, in atmospheric and ocean models, is necessary for more confident predictions at the regional and local level. Current limitations in computing power have placed severe limitations on such an investigation, which is now badly needed. These facilities will also provide the world's scientists with the computational laboratories for fundamental research on weather–climate interactions using 1 -km resolution models and on atmospheric, terrestrial, <b>cryospheric,</b> and oceanic <b>processes</b> at even finer scales. Each facility should have enabling infrastructure including hardware, software, and data analysis support, and scientific capacity to interact with the national centers and other visitors. This will accelerate our understanding of how the climate system works and how to model it. It will ultimately enable the climate community to provide society with climate predictions, which are based on our best knowledge of science and the most advanced technology...|$|R
