60|$|The {{birds that}} the two girls had brought in were duly {{returned}} to the yard, and the process was repeated till all the pet <b>cocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hens</b> had been submitted to the old woman--Hamburghs, Bantams, Cochins, Brahmas, Dorkings, and such other sorts as were in fashion just then--her perception of each visitor being seldom at fault as she received the bird upon her knees.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{think it}} was true.

When the beasts were satisfied, the maiden sat down beside the old man {{at the table and}} ate what was left for her. Soon the <b>cock</b> <b>and</b> <b>hen</b> began to tuck their heads under their wings, and the brindled cow blinked its eyes, so the maiden said, 'Shall we not go to rest now?' ...|$|R

"There {{is to be}} {{seen the}} chair of the poet, which fell into the hands of its present possessors at the wreck of the parsonage-house; they have {{frequently}} refused large offers of purchase; but more, I daresay, for the sake of drawing contributions from the curious than from any reverence for the bard. The chair is of oak, with back and seat of cane, which precluded all hopes of a secret drawer, like that lately discovered in Gay's. There is no fear of its being worn out by the devout earnestness of sitters--as the <b>cocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hens</b> have usurped undisputed possession of it, and protest most clamorously against all attempts to get it cleansed or to seat one's self.|$|E

60|$|About midday I came to where, in {{a secluded}} valley, there stood a single small cottage without any other {{building}} in sight. It was a neat little house, with a rustic porch {{and a small}} garden in front of it, with a swarm of <b>cocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hens.</b> I lay down among the ferns and watched it, for {{it seemed to be}} exactly {{the kind of place where}} I might obtain what I wanted. My bread was finished, and I was exceedingly hungry after my long journey; I determined, therefore, to make a short reconnaissance, and then to march up to this cottage, summon it to surrender, and help myself to all that I needed. It could at least provide me with a chicken and with an omelette. My mouth watered at the thought.|$|E

60|$|This notion rather {{interested}} Alfred; {{he began}} {{to build up a}} fine scheme of shouting out and sending Harold to the rescue of the <b>cocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hens,</b> and how well he would have done it himself a year ago, and pinned the thief, and fastened the door on him. Not that he thought this individual lad at all likely to be a thief, nor did he care much for Farmer Shepherd, who was a hard man and no favourite; but to catch a thief would be a grand feat. And while settling his clever plan, and making some compliments for the magistrate to pay him, Alfred, fanned by the cool breeze, fell into a sound sleep, and did not wake till the sun was high, {{and all the rest of}} the house were up and dressed.|$|E
60|$|The {{twilight}} closed in, {{the stars}} came out, sounds of life died away, and still she sat on, becoming almost torpid {{in the cold}} darkness, until at length she heard the low call of Lucette, 'MADAME! AH!la pauvre Madame.' She started up, so stiff that she could hardly more, and only guided by the voice to feel {{her way through the}} hedgerow in the right direction. Another moment, and Lucette's warn arms had received her; and she was guided, scarce knowing how or where, in cautious silence to the farmyard, and into the house, where a most welcome sight, a huge fire, blazed cheerfully on the hearth, and Martin himself held open the door for her. The other occupants of the kitchen were the sleeping child in its wooden cradle, some <b>cocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hens</b> upon the rafters, and a big sheep-dog before the fire.|$|E
60|$|At Tior, he evinced {{the same}} {{disregard}} for the religious prejudices of the islanders as he had previously shown for the superstitions of the sailors. Having heard {{that there were a}} considerable number of fowls in the valley—the progeny of some <b>cocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hens</b> accidentally left there by an English vessel, and which, being strictly tabooed, flew about almost in a wild state—he determined to break through all restraints, and be the death of them. Accordingly, he provided himself with a most formidable-looking gun, and announced his landing on the beach by shooting down a noble cock, that was crowing what proved to be his own funeral dirge on the limb of an adjoining tree. “Taboo,” shrieked the affrighted savages. “Oh, hang your taboo,” says the nautical sportsman; “talk taboo to the marines”; and bang went the piece again, and down came another victim. At this the natives ran scampering through the groves, horror-struck at the enormity of the act.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is also a}} {{distinct}} short-legged variation of The Danish hen called [...] Luttehøns, within the species. Luttehøns has a predisposition for very short legs {{of only a few}} centimetres, while the claws are of ordinary size and capability. Luttehøns are calmer in nature, with less lust for flight. They tend to be slightly heavier, with an average weight of 2.25 kg and 2.00 kg for the <b>cock</b> <b>and</b> <b>hen,</b> <b>and</b> the eggs weigh a minimum of 58 g. There is no lethal alleles, when Luttehøns and ordinary long-legged Danish hens are crossed.|$|R

6000|$|He was as dreary and as lean as ever. His {{eyes had}} not lost their old trick (so subtly noticed in Betteredge's NARRATIVE) of [...] "looking {{as if they}} {{expected}} something more from you than you were aware of yourself." [...] But, so far as dress can alter a man, the great Cuff was changed beyond all recognition. He wore a broad-brimmed white hat, a light shooting jacket, white trousers, and drab gaiters. He carried a stout oak stick. His whole aim and object seemed to be {{to look as if}} he had lived in the country all his life. When I complimented him on his Metamorphosis, he declined to take it as a joke. He complained, quite gravely, of the noises and the smells of London. I declare I am far from sure that he did not speak with a slightly rustic accent! I offered him breakfast. The innocent countryman was quite shocked. HIS breakfast hour was half-past six--and HE went to bed with the <b>cocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hens!</b> ...|$|E
60|$|Or say, {{we are so}} many <b>cocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hens,</b> my dear (sans arriere pensee), {{with our}} crops pretty full, our plumes pretty sleek, decent picking {{here and there in}} the straw-yard, and {{tolerable}} snug roosting in the barn: yonder on the terrace, in the sun, walks Peacock, stretching his proud neck, squealing every now and then in the most pert fashionable voice and flaunting his great supercilious dandified tail. Don't let us be too angry, my dear, with the useless, haughty, insolent creature, because he despises us. SOMETHING is there about Peacock that we don't possess. Strain your neck ever so, you can't make it as long or as blue as his--cock your tail as much as you please, and it will never be half so fine to look at. But the most absurd, disgusting, contemptible sight in the world would you and I be, leaving the barn-door for my lady's flower-garden, forsaking our natural sturdy walk for the peacock's genteel rickety stride, and adopting the squeak of his voice in the place of our gallant lusty cock-a-doodle-dooing.|$|E
60|$|The {{shape and}} {{carriage}} of the body, {{and the shape}} of the head differ much. The beak varies slightly in length and curvature, but incomparably less than with pigeons. In most crested fowls the nostrils offer a remarkable peculiarity in being raised with a crescentic outline. The primary wing- feathers are short in Cochins; in a male, which must have been more than twice as heavy as G. bankiva, these feathers were in both birds of the same length. I have counted, with Mr. Tegetmeier's aid, the primary wing- feathers in thirteen <b>cocks</b> <b>and</b> <b>hens</b> of various breeds; in four of them, namely in two Hamburghs, a Cochin, and Game bantam, there were 10, instead of the normal number 9; but in counting these feathers I have followed the practice of fanciers, and have NOT included the first minute primary feather, barely three-quarters of an inch in length. These feathers differ considerably in relative length, the fourth, or the fifth, or the sixth, being the longest; with the third either equal to, or considerably shorter than the fifth. In wild gallinaceous species the relative length and number of the main wing and tail-feathers are extremely constant.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Duks,' they said. Then {{the maiden}} {{stepped up to}} the stove where the animals were lying, <b>and</b> stroked the <b>cock</b> <b>and</b> the <b>hen,</b> <b>and</b> {{scratched}} the brindled cow between its horns.|$|R
60|$|CRAVEN (a little ruffled). Clubs are {{a matter}} of taste, Charteris. You like a <b>cock</b> <b>and</b> <b>hen</b> club: I don't.

I should be laughed out of London. The Ibsen club! Come, Cuthbertson, back me up. I'm sure you agree with me.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{he spoke}} to himself, when his eyes fell on a golden <b>cock</b> <b>and</b> a silver <b>hen</b> running swiftly along the grass in front of him. In a moment the words {{that the old man}} had uttered {{vanished}} from his mind and he gave chase. They were so near that he could almost seize their tails, yet each time he felt sure he could catch them his fingers closed on the empty air. At length he could run no more, and stopped to breathe, while the <b>cock</b> <b>and</b> <b>hen</b> went on as before. Then he remembered the cows, and, somewhat frightened, turned back to seek them. Luckily they had not strayed far, and were quietly feeding on the thick green grass.|$|R
