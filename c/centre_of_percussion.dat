50|$|The hilt is the {{collective}} {{term for the}} parts allowing for the handling {{and control of the}} blade; these consist of the grip, the pommel, and a simple or elaborate guard, which in post-Viking Age swords could consist of only a crossguard (called a cruciform hilt or quillons). The pommel was originally designed as a stop to prevent the sword slipping from the hand. From around the 11th century onward it became a counterbalance to the blade, allowing a more fluid style of fighting.It can also be used as a blunt instrument at close range, and its weight affects the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>percussion.</b> In later times a sword knot or tassel was sometimes added.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>percussion</b> (CP) of some hand-held sporting equipment (such as tennis rackets and baseball bats) for athletic performance is well known. In order to avoid injuries {{it is important that}} powerful blows are located close to the CP. Several species of glyptodont (giant armoured mammals) had tail clubs that can be modelled as rigid beams (like baseball bats) and it is generally assumed that these were useful for agonistic behaviour. However, the variation in tail club morphology among known genera suggests that a biomechanical and functional analysis of these structures could be useful. Here, we outline a novel method to determine the CP of the glyptodont tail clubs. We find that the largest species had the CP very close to the possible location of horny spikes. This is consistent with the inference that they were adapted to delivering powerful blows at that point. Our new analysis reinforces the case for agonistic use of tail clubs in several glyptodont species...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{procedures}} for the measurement of hand loads and the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>percussion</b> (COP) of cricket bats are described. Five commercial cricket bats were evaluated to demonstrate differences in static and dynamic performance characteristics. A standard bat was compared with three bats, incorporating different scallop shapes {{in the back of}} the bat and a fifth bat with two slots in the bat back containing honeycomb inserts. All the bats possessed the same external dimensions. Three clamping configurations were employed for measuring bat performance. Bat stiffness was measured using rigid mechanical clamps. Hand loads were measured with load transducers positioned in rigid clamps, in a hand simulator, and attached to the hands of human subjects. The COP for the five bats was measured in a hand simulator, which closely simulated hand loads. Bat and handle deflections for the five bats varied considerably, and in some instances, bat deflections were slightly non-linear. Hand loads were measured for one commercial bat subjected to ball impacts in rigidly clamped, simulator clamped and hand-held conditions. Simulator clamping closely mimicked the pattern of hand-held loads, but loads were approximately ten times higher in the hand simulator. The COPs for all five bats were evaluated by measuring loads in the hand simulator. A common COP located at 0. 18 m from the bat end was deduced but simulated hand loads varied considerably. Bat geometry was seen to influence the static and dynamic responses of the five commercial bats...|$|E
40|$|Selected methodologies {{currently}} {{used to assess}} baseball bat performance were evaluated {{through a series of}} finite element simulations. Results of the comparison show that current test methods contradict one another and do not describe the performance advantage of modern hollow bats over solid wood bats. The discrepancy was related to the way performance was quantified and the way the bat was tested. Performance metrics that do not consider a bat’s mass moment of inertia (MOI) were observed to underestimate the hitting performance of light weight bats. A bat’s <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>percussion</b> was observed to be an unreliable indicator of its sweet spot (i. e. impact location providing the maximum hit ball speed). Bat performance was found {{to be sensitive to the}} relative impact speed between the bat and ball. From these observations three recommendations concerning bat performance were made: (1) performance should be measured at relative speeds between the bat and ball that are representative of play conditions; (2) the ball should impact the bat at its experimentally determined sweet spot; and (3) performance should be quantified from ball and bat speeds before and after impact. Using current test methods, an aluminium bat had a 0. 9 % higher performance over wood (maximum), while using the proposed recommendations the difference was 3. 8 % (average). The variation in the relative performance over three test conditions reduced from 4 % using current test methods to 0. 3 % when the above recommen-dations were followed...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{previous}} studies conducted by different researchers have shown that impact techniques {{can be used to}} evaluate firmness (Delwiche et al., 1989; Delwiche et al.; 1996; Jaren et al., 1992; Ruiz Altisent et al., 1996). To impact the fruit with a small spherical impactor of known mass and radius of curvature and measure the acceleration of the impactor is a technique described by Chen et al. (1985) and used by several researchers for sensing fruit firmness (Jaren et al., 1992; Correa et al.; 1992). The advantages of this method vs. a force sensor that measures the force as a function of time is that the measured impact-acceleration response is independent of the fruit mass and is less sensitive to the variation in the radius of curvature of the fruit (Chen et al., 1996). Ruiz Altisent et al. (1993) developed and used a 50 g impactor with a 19 mm diameter spherical tip, dropping from different height for fruits (apples, pears, avocados, melons, peaches [...] .). Another impact device for firmness sensing of fruits was developed by Chen and Ruiz Altisent (1996). They designed and fabricated an experimental low-mass impact sensor for high-speed sensing of fruit firmness. The impactor consisted of a semi-spherical impacting tip attached to the end (near the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>percussion)</b> of a pivoting arm. Impact is done by swinging the impactor to collide with the fruit. It has been implemented for on-line use. In both devices a small accelerometer is mounted behind the impacting tip. Lateral impactor and vertical impactor have been used in laboratory and the results from non-destructive impact tests have contributed to standardise methods to measure fruit firmness: Barreiro (1992) compared impact parameters and results of Magness-Taylor penetration tests for apples, pears, apricots [and peaches; Agulheiro (1994) studied the behaviour of the impact parameters during seven weeks of cold storage of two melon varieties; Ortiz (1998) used low energy impact and NIR procedures to segregate non crispy, non firm and soft peaches. Steinmetz (1996) compared various non-destructive firmness sensors, based on sound, impact and micro-deformation...|$|E

40|$|Autonomous {{vehicles}} {{have become}} a reality, many vehicles have implemented some features to allow partial or full autonomy; however, full autonomous driving near the limit of friction still presents many obstacles, especially near the limit of friction. Autonomous test vehicles are expensive to build and maintain, running the vehicles usually requires highly specialized training, and testing can be dangerous. Research has shown that small sized scaled vehicles {{may be used as}} an alternative to full size vehicle testing. The first part of this thesis presents the construction of a 1 = 5 th scaled vehicle testbed. This testbed is inexpensive to construct, easy to maintain, and safe to test compared to full size vehicles. In the linear region, the dynamic response of the tires also closely mimics full size tires and the Dugoff tire model. The small sized testbed is therefore an ideal alternative to full size vehicles. The interaction between the road and the tires remains a challenge to estimate, but a requirement for eff ective control. Tire dynamics are highly non-linear, and are dependent on many variables. Tire slip angles are di fficult to estimate without expensive sensors set-up. Many linear and non-linear estimation methods have been developed to tackle this problem, but each having its limitations. The second part of the thesis presents a method for slip angle estimation, and proposes an observer design which integrates a linear component with the Dugoff tire model and a pneumatic trail estimator. This design is fast to operate, and does not require expensive sensors. With the addition of the pneumatic trail block, accurate slip angles can be obtained in the tires linear and saturation regions equally. Controlling near the limit of friction requires consistently accurate tire states, which is di fficult to achieve with slip angles. With the margin of error under a degrees, a slight error in slip angle estimates while operating at the limit of friction may result in loss of control. The final contribution of this thesis proposes a simpli ed feedforward lateral controller based on the concept of <b>Centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>Percussion</b> (COP), and a longitudinal controller that operates based on lateral acceleration. This control scheme avoids using slip angles, but still pushes the vehicle performance to the limit of friction. The architecture is validated in high fi delity simulations...|$|E
