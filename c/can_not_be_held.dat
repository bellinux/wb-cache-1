[...] It was argued that the group of American Indians who had taken the livestock were distinct from any other American Indian tribal group, and therefore the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe should not be held responsible for what had occurred. After the hearing, the Supreme Court held that the judgment made previously in the Court of Claims would not be changed.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{simultaneously}} clustering columns and rows (coclustering) arises in important applications, such as text data mining, microarray analysis, and recommendation system analysis. Compared with the classical clustering algorithms, co-clustering algorithms {{have been shown}} to be more effective in discovering hidden clustering structures in the data matrix. The complexity of previous co-clustering algorithms is usually O(m × n), where m and n are the numbers of rows and columns in the data matrix respectively. This limits their applicability to data matrices involving a large number of columns and rows. Moreover, some huge datasets <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> entirely <b>held</b> in main memory during co-clustering which violates the assumption made by the previous algorithms. In this paper, we propose a general framework for fast co-clustering large datasets, CRD. By utilizing recently developed sampling-based matrix decomposition methods, CRD achieves an execution time linear in m and n. Also, CRD does not require the whole data matrix be in the main memory. We conducted extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data. Compared with previous co-clustering algorithms, CRD achieves competitive accuracy but with much less computational cost...|$|R
40|$|Our recent {{search for}} the {{presence}} of a magnetic field in the bright early A-type supergiant HD 92207 using FORS 2 in spectropolarimetric mode indicated the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field of the order of a few hundred Gauss. Assuming the ideal case of a non-variable star, this discovery has recently been questioned in one work trying to demonstrate the importance of non-photon noise in FORS 2 observations. The assumption of non-variability of HD 92207 <b>can,</b> however, <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> since substantial profile variations of diverse lines on a time scale of minutes or maybe even a fraction of a minute are detected in FORS 2 spectra. The presence of short-term spectral variability in blue supergiants, which are considered as type II supernova progenitors, has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> a subject of systematic studies before and is critical for the current theoretical understanding of their physics. Given the detected short term variability, the question of the presence of a magnetic field cannot be answered without proper modeling of the impact of such a variability on the measurements of the magnetic field. Since the short-term periodicity does not fit into the currently known domain of non-radially pulsating supergiants, its confirmation is of great importance for models of stellar evolution.

30|$|As one of {{the first}} and most cited and most {{influential}} models of CSR (Schwartz & Carroll 2003) this precedence given to economic responsibilities has permeated the subsequent literature and the discourse surrounding CSR. Nevertheless, Carroll’s pyramid of CSR <b>can</b> clearly <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> responsible for the entire direction of the CSR discourse. Indeed, almost as prevalent in CSR textbooks as Carroll’s pyramid of CSR is Friedman’s assertions that “the social responsibility of business is to make a profit” ((Friedman 1970), p. 13). Brooks (2010) argues that the response of the CSR academy to Friedman’s pronouncement led to a wrong turn {{in the development of the}} CSR construct, as rather than justifying CSR on moral grounds, the academic community (of which Carroll was a part), responded by attempting to justify CSR in economic terms. Brooks argues that this has resulted in an almost obsessive quest to find a positive relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and CFP that has dominated the CSR discourse ever since, leading to a marginalization of moral considerations. It has been argued that CSR has won the battle, but lost the war in the sense that although Carroll’s business-friendly model may have allowed CSR to have become accepted and even embraced by the business community, it does not allow ethical or even legal arguments to take precedence over economic arguments (Brooks 2010). Indeed if CSR was truly a moral responsibility then its relationship to CFP should be moot, yet while there are numerous articles relating to the relationship between CSR and CFP, there are very few exploring the social and environmental impacts of CSR (Baden & Harwood 2013), providing an indication of how far Carroll’s conception of CSR is from being a model of genuine social responsibility.|$|R
40|$|The work of {{this thesis}} focuses on {{stochastic}} methods for the simulation of superconducting charge qubits, also known as Cooper pair boxes, which are promising candidates for large scale quantum information processing. To aid non-physicists, a brief outline {{of the structure of}} quantum mechanics is provided using theÃ‚Â· Dirac formalism. Using the so called 'Backreaction effect', we consider if any information can be obtained regarding the qubit behaviour, through detecting the changes observed in the frequency spectrum of the coupled biasing circuitry, modelled as a dissipative oscillator circuit. The process of modelling dissipative quantum systems is described, however an alternative approach called 'quantum trajectories' is used rather than the traditional Calderia-Leggett model, as the time evolution of a single 'trajectory' represents the evolution of an individual system coupled to a noisy environment. Through the noise generated by an excited qubit, the energy level structure of the qubit can be probed with a microwave drive field, by observing the noise power within the biasing circuit. We consider a biasing circuit of unusually high resonant frequency which can drive the qubit, this creates frequency splitting features that would <b>not</b> normally <b>be</b> observed. Weak measurement is also examined as this is closely related to the stochastic 'quantum trajectories', where the measurement is recorded by the observer rather than lost to an environment. Weakly measuring a qubit does not completely collapse it and therefore 'quantum feedback' may be employed to alter the qubit controls favourably. In particular we consider the problem of purifying a weakly measured system rapidly; given a qubit in the completely mixed state what is the best feedback to become confident in the actual qubit state quickly. There are two optimal feedback protocols proposed by Jacobs [1] and by Wiseman and Ralph [2] for purifying qubits that have ideal controls. However, we adapt these protocols for the charge qubit, whose finite Hamiltonian resources and non-zero ax tunnelling term means the Bloch vector <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> easily <b>held</b> in the optimal location.

40|$|The {{past few}} decades have seen {{a rise in the}} number of people who are over- weight and obese in the Netherlands, which has {{resulted}} in an increase in people who develop diabetes. In light of the rise in healthcare costs that this brings about and the feeling of injustice when a considerable proportion of public resources are being spent to treat self-inflicted -and thus avoidable- disease, this paper discusses whether compulsory lifestyle treatment combined with a policy of having to pay higher health insurance premiums in case of non-compliance with lifestyle treatment, could help to contain these healthcare costs as well as promote health and quality of life in the overweight. Problems with the current diabetes treatment protocol when it comes to the overweight and obese are discussed, and it is explained how a policy of lifestyle treatment could provide an answer to these problems. Furthermore, the circumstances under which it can be morally defended that people are treated unequally in an (otherwise) egalitarian system are discussed, and this is applied to Dutch health insurance practice. A forward-looking conception of moral responsibility for disease is proposed, which avoids the problems associated with a backward-looking conception of responsibility, such as that people <b>can</b> often <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> fully responsible for their past behaviour. Several problems with the alternative proposal are discussed, such as the risk of undermining the trust between doctor and patient, effective exclusion of health insurance this policy might cause due to high premiums, and the impingement of a person’s autonomy by making lifestyle treatment compulsory for overweight diabetes patients. Also, several unresolved issues are explored, such as whether the costs of lifestyle treatment should be covered by public health insurance when lifestyle treatment turns out to be very effective, but not cost-effective; the question of whether to make lifestyle therapy compulsory for other overweight persons who have not yet developed any overweight related disease and might benefit equally; and whether a similar policy should be applied to other patient groups with self-inflicted disease, and if so, what the results should be when someone belongs to more than one of the patient categories to which this policy is applied (especially with respect to higher insurance premiums) ...|$|R

40|$|Does a Postal Principle, a {{principle}} of destinerrance, hold true for computer mediated communication (CMC) ? Perhaps, however, the question <b>is</b> <b>not</b> one concerning technology. Is it rather the case that we must ask, after Derrida, after all, whether destinerrance ever held true, as {{a principle}}? This paper considers the prospect that the Postal Principle was, in principle, or as a principle, an expression of a truth value from something that <b>can</b> <b>not</b> in fact, <b>be</b> <b>held</b> at all: the ghost in the machine. Drawing on a phenomenology of computer practice, the paper argues that there is greater explanatory value {{to be found in}} Derrida’s more recent comments on the relative exteriority of the technological apparatus (in Archive Fever and elsewhere), framing an understanding of the human body as partes extra partes. Yet it is demonstrated here that this same framing was already in place from the moment that the principle of destinerrance was first articulated, that a subsequent technical turn in Derrida's work merely extends a framework already set in place in the earlier work (in The Post Card, for example). It is argued, then, that in articulating a Postal Principle for the purpose of guaranteeing its failure, Derrida had calculated the future trajectory – and had built the logic of the calculation and of the 'jet' words, as he calls them, into this trajectory – of what I call the 'fantasy of the disembodied virtualm' through which users of CMC project themselves into the archive of archives that the internet was bound to become...|$|R

50|$|A Laird is {{a member}} of the gentry in Scotland. In the non-peerage table of precedence, a Laird ranks below a Baron and above an Esquire. Though {{signifying}} the same as Lord, the two terms are not interchangeable and Laird is not a title of nobility. The designation of Laird is a 'corporeal hereditament' (an inheritable property that has an explicit tie to the physical land), i.e. the title <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> in gross, and cannot be bought and sold without selling the physical land. The title does not entitle the owner to sit in the House of Lords and is the Scottish equivalent to an English squire in that it is not a noble title, more a courtesy title meaning landowner with no other rights assigned to it. However, a Laird possessing a Coat of Arms registered in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland {{is a member}} of Scotland's minor nobility. Such an individual can be recognised as a Laird, (if not a Chief or Chieftain, or descendant of one of these), by the formal recognition of a territorial designation as a part of their name by the Lord Lyon. Only those so recognised continue to use the designation after parting from their estate. The Lord Lyon is the ultimate arbiter as to determining entitlement to a territorial designation, and his right of discretion in recognising these, and their status as a name, dignity or title, has been confirmed in the Scottish courts.|$|E

She is a 9-year-old girl with terminal cancer (alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma), but tests reveal that her cancer is in remission, meaning that the hallucinations are unrelated to her cancer. Meanwhile, House questions Andie's motives for her bravery, suggesting it may itself be {{a symptom of a}} problem in her amygdala.House discovers a benign tumor in her heart, which is surgically removed, but it does not account for the hallucinations. House deduces that there must be a clot which the cancer deployed prior to removal. He suggests employing therapeutic hypothermia to discover the clot, which does not show on an angiography: Cooling her body temperature down to 21° Celsius will stop her heart, effectively making her clinically dead. Then the doctors will remove 2-3 liters of blood and discover the clot when the blood is pumped back in. House compares this procedure to [...] "performing an autopsy on a living person."The blood removal and temperature <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> for more than 60 seconds or she will suffer permanent damage.

House concedes he was wrong about Andie's bravery being a symptom of her clot, but replies to Wilson saying the girl is dead anyway. Wilson states that Andie could outlive him.
