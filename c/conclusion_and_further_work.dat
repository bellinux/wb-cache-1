40|$|A {{number of}} new Citizen Science {{projects}} and Smart City initiatives have the common challenge of providing a smartphone with functional- ity to consume data and / or produce data. For many of these projects the data contains location information, and a common use case is to vi- sualize the data on a map. With these commonalities, {{it should not be}} necessary to start from scratch each time a new smartphone application is developed. The following research question is addressed in this thesis: How can anyone with an idea for an application within the field of Smart City and Citizen Science realize it in a time and cost effective manner? The first part of the thesis is addressing the motivation and problem definition for rapid development of Smart City and Citizen Science applications. Based on this a set of different requirements in five different categories is presented. These requirements area applied for the evaluation of existing mobile application development tools in the groups of generic and specialized frameworks. The main part of the thesis is presenting CITAPPLAB with vision, design, implementation and validation on a practical example. The toolkit, CITAPPLAB, provides a common simplified interface to work with different data sources, such as CKAN, NGSI, SPARQL, WFS and REST. With a common interface, it will be easier and faster to use data from different sources in the application.

40|$|This Thesis {{proposes a}} user-independent gesture {{recognition}} system, which operates in real-time under real-world conditions, {{and as such}} could be useful as a building block in a more sophisticated human-computer interface. In the proposed system, efficient and robust extraction/representation of motion patterns is achieved by utilizing relative-motion dependent primitive features. This bottom-up approach for primitive feature extraction in the early processing stage {{of the system is}} combined with multivariate analysis based top-down learning and Dynamic Buffer Structures for online gesture segmentation. The proposed system exhibits good generalization abilities even if trained with only a few samples. In test experiments conducted on several different data sets it was observed that system’s performance is robust to changes in the background and in the illumination conditions, to subjects’ body size and external appearance, able to cope with the non-uniformity in the performance speed of the gestures, etc., all of which are important conditions for a successful application in human-computer interfaces. Gesture recognition in the present system is not restricted to hand gestures only – larger-scale whole body gestures can be processed simultaneously with relatively smaller-scale hand or head gestures. No manual segmentation of any kind or use of markers, sensors, etc. is necessary. Also, since no domain knowledge is utilized, the system proposed here can be easily adapted and applied to other problems involving motion recognition. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|An {{autonomous}} robot surviving in the 3 D world may sample its environment as a 2 D image sequence, each image differing slightly from its predecessor {{as a result}} of robot/scene motion. Furthermore, such a system may not require specific identification of objects within a scene but rather be more "concerned" as to which objects pose a threat or obstacle to some future action, or to the recovery of information about the robot's own motion relative to the scene (the so called ego-motion). This document introduces the concept of 3 D environmental structure and sensor motion recovery from 2 D image sequences and more especially the concept of an optical flow field. Problems inherent in both sensor and optical flow field characteristics are described and their consequences discussed. By considering the informational content of variously derived flow fields the requirement for 3 D environmental structure constraints is introduced.

40|$|Abstract-Body {{slip angle}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} information for vehicle motion control; as specific sensors for body slip angle measurement are expensive, it is necessary to investigate estimation methods using existing popular sensors such as gyro sensor, encoder, camera, etc. For EV (electric vehicle), in particular, the motor response is several milliseconds which enables high performance control with short control period; fast signal feedback is consequently desired. Nevertheless, the sampling rate of a normal camera is much slower compared with other kinds of onboard sensors and the time delay caused by image processing cannot be neglected. In this paper, the two problems are solved using a multi-rate Kalman filter with measurement delay included; the estimated body slip angle can be updated every 1 ms. First of all, vehicle model and visual model are explained followed with experimental setup introduction; then, real-time image processing techniques are briefly introduced; and then, single-rate and multi-rate Kalman filters considering time delay are designed to estimate body slip angle; finally, <b>conclusion</b> <b>and</b> <b>further</b> <b>works</b> are presented.

Experiments were carried out with phrases, analyzing the semantics of the message and the tone of voice of patients through unstructured interviews to healthy people and patients with early Alzheimer's stage.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} the theoretical foundations of an approach for intelligent systems development. Derived from semiotics, a classic discipline in human sciences, the theory developed provides a mathematical framework for the concept of knowledge and for knowledge processing. As a result, a new perspective to study and to develop intelligent systems emerges. In part I, we focused on the essentials of such a theory. It included the background needed from semiotics, describing the relationship between semiotics, intelligent systems and cognition. A taxonomy of the elementary types of knowledge was proposed, followed by another classification considered by the point of view of its application in a cognitive system. In addition, a mathematical definition of objects and object networks, were proposed. Here, in part II, we proceed introducing the issues concerning knowledge modeling and system development. The elementary types of knowledge are modelled using the concepts of objects and object networks. Based on the idea of applied knowledge, a general architecture for an intelligent system is suggested. An example concerning control of an autonomous vehicle is addressed to illustrate the use of computational semiotics in developing intelligent systems, and to show how intelligent systems can be implemented.

40|$|For {{practical}} applications, {{the use of}} top-down query-driven proofprocedures {{is essential}} for an efficient use and computation of answers using Logic Programs as knowledge bases. Additionally, abductive reasoning by need is intrinsically a top-down search method. A query-solving engine is thus highly desirable. The current standard 2 -valued semantics for Normal Logic Programs (NLPs), the Stable Models (SMs) semantics, {{does not allow for}} top-down query-solving because it does not enjoy the relevancy property — and moreover, it does not guarantee the existence of a model for every NLP. To overcome these current limitations we developed a new 2 -valued semantics for NLPs — the Layered Models semantics — which conservatively extends the SMs, enjoys relevancy and guarantees model existence among other useful properties. Moreover, {{there is no need to}} compute whole models, but just the partial models that sustain the answer to a query; relevancy ensures these can be extended to whole models. A first implementation of a query-solving engine based on this new semantics is presented and described here. It uses the XSB-Prolog engine and its XASP interface to Smodels, thereby providing a useful tool built as a hybrid of the two systems and taking advantage of the best of each. <b>Conclusions</b> <b>and</b> <b>further</b> <b>work</b> terminate the paper...|$|R
