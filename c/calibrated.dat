40|$|Camera {{modelling}} and <b>calibrating</b> is {{a crucial}} problem for further metric measuring of a scene. A lot of di#erent <b>calibrating</b> techniques and surveys about calibration have been presented in last years. However, it is still di#cult to go into details of a determined <b>calibrating</b> technique and to compare it {{with respect to the}} others.

5|$|A {{theodolite}} can {{be considerably}} more accurate if used correctly, {{but it is}} also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be <b>calibrated</b> using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a clinometer.|$|E

5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps {{before they are}} suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is <b>calibrated</b> automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.|$|E

Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|E

It is necessary to <b>calibrate</b> dark current and black level to improve quality of CMOS image sensors. The dark current is corrected by optimizing pixel structure, perfecting technology, improving 6 layout, and correction double sample. But these ways do not <b>calibrate</b> black level. So, {{it is important to}} <b>calibrate</b> black level using black level calibration algorithm in the stage of image processing. 1...|$|R
