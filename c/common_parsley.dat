60|$|The Umbelliferae are proterandrous, and {{can hardly}} fail to be cross-fertilised {{by the many}} flies and small Hymenoptera which visit the flowers. (5/18. Hermann Muller 'Befruchtung' etc. page 96. According to M. Mustel as stated by Godron 'De l'esp√®ce' tome 2 page 58 1859, {{varieties}} of the carrot growing near each other readily intercross.) A plant of the <b>common</b> <b>parsley</b> was covered by a net, and it apparently produced as many and as fine spontaneously self-fertilised fruits or seeds as the adjoining uncovered plants. The flowers on the latter were visited by so many insects that they must have received pollen from one another. Some of these two lots of seeds were left on sand, but nearly all the self-fertilised seeds germinated before the others, so that I was forced to throw all away. The remaining seeds were then sown on the opposite sides of four pots. At first the self-fertilised seedlings were a little taller {{in most of the}} pots than the naturally crossed seedlings, and this no doubt was due to the self-fertilised seeds having germinated first. But in the autumn all the plants were so equal that it did not seem worth while to measure them. In two of the pots they were absolutely equal; in a third, if there was any difference, it was in favour of the crossed plants, and in a somewhat plainer manner in the fourth pot. But neither side had any substantial advantage over the other; so that in height they may be said to be as 100 to 100.|$|E

50|$|Adult Iberian parsley frogs {{attain a}} length of about 4 cm and look {{very similar to the}} <b>common</b> <b>parsley</b> frog (Pelodytes punctatus, its sister species) but are a little smaller with shorter limbs. The skin is smooth or {{granular}} with a scattering of dark-coloured tubercles. The dorsal surface varies from olive, greenish-brown, dark brown or greenish-grey and is flecked with green specks. The undersurface is white or cream and the throat of breeding males is dark-coloured.|$|E
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>parsley</b> frog (Pelodytes punctatus) is a {{very small}} and slender frog with long hindlegs, flat head and {{vertical}} pupils. Males reach only 3.5, females 4.5 centimetres. The upper side of the body is variable in colour, usually with irregular green patches on a light brown, grey or light olive background. The frog's back is dotted with elongated warts, often in undulating longitudinal rows that can be orange along the flanks. Behind the protruding eyes and above the tympanum, there is short, small gland. It does not have parotid glands. The underside is white, and around the pelvis yellowy orange. In the mating season, males develop dark swellings on the insides of their digits and forelimbs, {{as well as on the}} chest. The males' forelimbs are stronger than females'.|$|E

50|$|Psoralen (also called psoralene) is {{the parent}} {{compound}} {{in a family}} of natural products known as furocoumarins. It is structurally related to coumarin by the addition of a fused furan ring, and may be considered as a derivative of umbelliferone. Psoralen occurs naturally in the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, {{as well as in the}} <b>common</b> fig, celery, <b>parsley,</b> West Indian satinwood and in all citrus fruits. It is widely used in PUVA (psoralen + UVA) treatment for psoriasis, eczema, vitiligo, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Many furocoumarins are extremely toxic to fish, and some are deposited in streams in Indonesia to catch fish.|$|R
5000|$|Apiastrum is a {{monotypic}} genus {{of flowering}} {{plant in the}} Apiaceae, containing the single species Apiastrum angustifolium, which is known by the <b>common</b> name mock <b>parsley.</b> It is native to California and Baja California, where it is resident in many types of habitat. This is an annual herb producing a branching stem up to half a meter tall from a taproot. Leaves are plentiful along the stem, each up to about 5 centimeters long and split into many narrow lobes. Several inflorescences arise from the stem, often but not always from leaf axils. The inflorescence is a compound umbel of tiny flowers each with five pointed white petals.|$|R
50|$|Along {{the center}} of the island runs a narrow ridge, which is a remnant of the ice age. It has steep slopes in some parts and is up to 22 meters tall. There are no forests on the island, but only {{individual}} trees of elm, spruce, pine, birch, aspen and alder. The trees host about 28 species of polypores (tree mushrooms), and there are more than 100 species of moss. Most of the island is covered in meadows, which are quite varied and rich in colors and species, including rare and protected. A large part of them are of legume family. <b>Common</b> are cow <b>parsley,</b> various species centaurea, tansy and verbascum densiflorum.|$|R
50|$|Oenanthe sarmentosa is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the carrot family known by the <b>common</b> name water <b>parsley.</b> It is native to western North America from Alaska to California, where it grows in wet areas, such as streambanks. It is sometimes aquatic, growing in the water. The plant {{has been used in}} cultivation in wetlands, and the recent discovery of several colonies growing by a stream in Illinois demonstrates its capacity to become a noxious weed if it is introduced elsewhere. This is a perennial herb growing to a maximum height near 1.5 meters. The leaves have blades up to 30 centimeters long borne on petioles up to 35 centimeters in length. The parsley-like leaf blade is divided into serrated, lobed leaflets. The inflorescence is a compound umbel of many flowers with bright white to red-tinged petals.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} is to measure the levels of heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd and Pb) found in <b>common</b> {{vegetables}} (<b>parsley,</b> carrot, onion, lettuce, cucumber and green beans) grown in contaminated mining areas compared with those grown in reference clear area and to determine their potential detrimental effects via calculation of the daily metal intake (DImetal) and Target Hazard Quotients (THQ) for normal daily consumption of these vegetables, for male and female gender. Results Compared with the reference in contaminated areas, soil and plant contents of all analyzed metals are higher, usually over normally content for Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb. Particularly, in soil, higher values than intervention threshold values (ITV) were found for Cu and Pb and higher than maximum allowable limits (MAL) for Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb for parsley roots and leaves, carrot roots, cabbage, lettuce and cucumber. DImetal and THQ values for male and female were calculated for each vegetable and metal and for which oral reference doses exist. The combined THQ values calculated are concerning in that they are usually below the safe level of THQ Conclusion The results of this study regarding metal contents in soils, vegetables, DImetal and THQ suggest that the consumption of some vegetables (especially parsley, carrot and cabbage and less for lettuce, cucumber and green beans) is not free of risks in these areas. The complex THQ parameter use in health risk assessment of heavy metals provides a better image than using only a simple parameter (contents of metals in soils and vegetables). </p...|$|R
40|$|Wild parsnip is a nonnative, {{invasive}} {{plant that}} is rapidly increasing {{in many areas}} of Wisconsin. This plant, native to Europe and Asia, is in the Umbelliferae family (also known as the Apiaceae family or in <b>common</b> terms, the <b>parsley</b> or carrot family) and {{is believed to have been}} introduced as a vegetable plant as the taproots are edible. As wild parsnip has spread within Wisconsin, so has the realization that human exposure often leads to serious burns and blisters on the arms and legs. Being able to readily identify wild parsnip will minimize inadvertent and excessive exposure to this plant and the often painful results that follow. During much of July, wild parsnip is one of the dominant yellow-flowered weeds in many roadsides and other right-of-ways, fence rows, prairie restorations, CRP sites and poorly managed pastures. Plants are most abundant in sites dominated by perennial grasses that are mowed once or twice annually. Description. The seedling leaves are small and ovate while the first true leaves are arranged in spiral fashion, forming the typical rosette observed in the first year of growth. Fully developed rosettes have 10 to 15 pinnately compound leaves with broad ovate to oblong leaflets. When plants flower they produce a stout, smooth, hollow, grooved flower stalk that can reach 5 feet i...|$|R
50|$|The Ameryka {{peninsula}} {{is located}} in between the two lakes Orzysz and Wierzbi≈Ñskie, which is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Wierzbi≈Ñskie Bay. From {{the western part of the}} lake there is a bridge which crosses a narrow gap. The width of the peninsula ranges from about 100 to 300 metres. In the narrowest parts of the peninsula, both of the lakes can be seen. On both sides of the lake there are overgrown patches of Alnus glutinosa. Some roots of the trees are visible due to waves eroding their soil, creating a separate characteristic to the part of the lake. Both of the lakes are eutrophic and have similar water-based plants. There is a large amount of swamp vegetation, including the following species found in the lake: bugleweed, bittersweet, water mint, yellow water-lily, and Canadian waterweed. In some parts the shore has sand and is easily accessible. There are also synanthrope plants in the lake: burdock, lion's tail, <b>common</b> nettle, cow <b>parsley,</b> tetterwort and <b>common</b> wormwood. To the southeastern part of the lake, the peninsula becomes more wider and the plants become luxuriant. There are different types of plants in that part than elsewhere: there are blueberries, blackberries and moss, and in the autumn mushrooms grow. In the forest there are visible trenches from World War II. Along the southern part of the shore of Wierzbi≈Ñskie Lake, there is the stretched village Wierzbiny.|$|R
