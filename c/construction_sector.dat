25|$|The 2010 National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement (NHIS-OHS) {{identified}} work organization {{factors and}} occupational psychosocial and chemical/physical exposures which may increase some health risks.

40|$|Gross Domestic Product (GDP) {{was created}} {{as a way to}} measure US {{production}} of products and services. GDP was not intended to guide policy making or as an indicator of the country's welfare. The commercial <b>construction</b> <b>sectors</b> of asbestos abatement, soil remediation, and building demolition are tangential to the actual cost of constructing a building and the country {{would be better off if}} these <b>construction</b> <b>sectors</b> were not necessary, even at the jeopardy of a reduced GDP. This thesis examines the specific costs of these <b>construction</b> <b>sectors</b> in Seattle commercial construction industry and determines that 1. 66 percent of a Seattle commercial construction project's cost is spent on asbestos abatement, soil remediation, and building demolition. This research challenges the use of GDP and emphasizes the need for a different means to measure economic progress in consideration of the incurred environmental and social costs in the production of products and services...|$|R
