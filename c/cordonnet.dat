5000|$|The terms gimp and <b>cordonnet</b> can, for {{the most}} part, be used interchangeably, as both are defined as the thread that forms {{the outline of the}} design. The term [...] "cordonnet" [...] is used {{particularly}} when the outline is padded and when the thread is completely {{on the surface of the}} lace. When the thread is made of more than one strand (as in Chantilly lace), it is also called a <b>cordonnet.</b> In machine-made laces the outlining thread is always called a <b>cordonnet.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is a {{continuous}} lace, {{meaning that it}} was made in one piece on a lace pillow, using the same threads in the pattern as in the ground, or réseau. Antwerp lace {{is very similar to}} Mechlin lace, which was also made in Antwerp. Antwerp lace is heavier and sturdier than Mechlin lace. It has a <b>cordonnet,</b> or a flat thread outlining the pattern, just as Mechlin lace does. The <b>cordonnet</b> was very strong and rather coarse. Antwerp lace was also similar to Binche lace in its <b>cordonnet.</b> The réseau or ground for Antwerp lace varies from the same hexagonal ground as Mechlin lace to a tessellation-pattern featuring a six-pointed star.|$|E

50|$|Brussels lace is part lace. This {{is made in}} pieces, {{with the}} flowers and design made {{separate}} from the ground, unlike Mechlin lace or Valenciennes lace; because of this, the long threads that form the design always follow the curves of the pattern, whereas in bobbin laces made all at once, the threads are parallel {{to the length of}} the lace. Brussels lace is also distinguished by its réseau or background, the toilé or pattern, and the lack of a <b>cordonnet</b> outlining the pattern. The réseau is hexagonal, with four threads plaited four times on two sides, and two threads twisted twice on the remaining four sides. The toilé can be of two types, the standard woven texture like a piece of fabric, or a more open version with more of the appearance of a netted réseau. This allows for shading in the designs, an effect that was used more in the later designs. In Brussels lace, instead of a <b>cordonnet,</b> the pattern is edged with open stitches, which are then picked up to form the réseau.|$|E
50|$|Binche lace {{is a type}} of {{bobbin lace}} that {{originated}} in the town of Binche, Belgium. It is continuous, meaning it is made all at once, in one piece. It is generally made in strips 2 inches (5 cm) wide. Though typically it has no <b>cordonnet</b> outlining the design against the ground, occasional pieces are made with a very fine one, about the same thickness as the thread used in the pattern. The pattern in Binche lace is very detailed, with animal scenes and figures.|$|E
50|$|Valenciennes lace is {{made on a}} lace pillow in one piece, {{with the}} réseau (the net-like ground) being made {{at the same time}} as the toilé (the pattern). It differentiates itself from other types of lace because the {{openness}} of the réseau, the closeness and evenness of the toilé, which resembles cambric, and that it lacks any <b>cordonnet</b> (a loosely spun silk cord used to outline and define the pattern). Also, in real Flemish Valenciennes lace there are no twisted sides to the mesh; all are closely plaited, and as a rule the shape of the mesh is diamond but without the openings.|$|E
5000|$|Older designs, {{especially}} {{through the}} early 1900s, tend to use fine white or ivory thread (50 to 100 widths to the inch) and intricate designs. Often they were constructed of small pieces 10 cm or less in diameter, which were then tied to each other to form a larger piece — a shawl, veil or umbrella, for example. This thread was either made of silk or a silk blend, to allow for improper stitches to be easily removed. The mercerization process strengthened cotton threads and spread their use in tatting. Newer designs from the 1920s and onward often use thicker thread {{in one or more}} colors, as well as newer joining methods, {{to reduce the number of}} thread ends to be hidden. The best thread for tatting is a [...] "hard" [...] thread that does not untwist readily. <b>Cordonnet</b> thread is a common tatting thread; Perl cotton is an example of a beautiful cord that is nonetheless a bit loose for tatting purposes. Some tatting designs incorporate ribbons and beads.|$|E
50|$|Chantilly lace {{is known}} for its fine ground, {{outlined}} pattern, and abundant detail. The pattern is outlined in <b>cordonnet,</b> a flat untwisted strand. The best Chantilly laces were made of silk, and were generally black, which made them suitable for mourning wear. White Chantilly lace was also made, both in linen and silk, though most Chantilly laces were made of silk. The black silk Chantilly lace became especially popular, and there was a large market for it in Spain and the Americas. Chantilly and the Spanish laces (such as Blonde lace) were the most popular black laces. Little white Chantilly was ever made. Another notable thing about Chantilly lace is the use of a half-and-whole stitch as a fill to achieve the effect of light and shadow in the pattern, which was generally of flowers. The background, or réseau, was {{in the form of a}} six pointed star, and was made of the same thread as the pattern, unlike the otherwise similar Blonde lace. The lace was produced in strips approximately four inches wide, and then joined with a stitch that left no visible seam.|$|E
