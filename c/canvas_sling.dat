25|$|With Northern California as a {{permanent}} base, Yerkes now painted for herself. She had ready access {{to some of the}} West’s greatest natural wonders. She traveled, camped and painted from Yosemite Valley to Santa Fe and from Tucson to Alberta, Canada. Travelogues, kept by her husband, showed detailed records of these adventures all throughout the 1930s and 40s. They toured in their specially modified 1920s Buick which was equipped with extra storage pockets and a <b>canvas</b> <b>sling</b> for an interior bed. Yerkes, her husband, and their daughter Mary, (nicknamed Min), spent weekends and holidays traveling on dirt roads to explore the inner sanctums of the newly established National Parks. Extended expeditions took them several times throughout the West and they toured many National Parks including; Crater Lake, Mt Rainier, Glacier, Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Rainbow Bridge and Arches, Mesa Verde, Joshua Tree, Death Valley, Grand Canyon, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and Yosemite, as well as the Oregon, Washington and California coasts. Yosemite Valley was a particular favorite subject matter and destination because of its beauty and proximity to San Mateo.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{losses to}} enemy fighters forced the {{reintroduction}} of a rear gunner; early Il-2s were field modified by cutting {{a hole in}} the fuselage behind the cockpit for a gunner sitting on a <b>canvas</b> <b>sling</b> armed with a 12.7mm UBT machine gun in an improvised mounting. The semi-turret gun mount allowed the machine gun to be fired at angles of up to 35° upwards, 35° to starboard and 15° to port. Tests showed that maximum speed decreased by between 10 and 20km/h (6.2–12.4mph) and that the two-seater was more difficult to handle because the center of gravity was shifted backwards. At the beginning of March 1942, a production two-seat Il-2 with the new gunner's cockpit began manufacturer tests. The second cockpit and armament increased all-up weight by 170kg (374lb) so the flaps were allowed to be deployed at an angle of 17° to avoid an over-long takeoff run. The new variant had a lengthened fuselage compartment with an extended canopy offering some protection from the elements. Unlike the well-armoured cockpit of the pilot compartment with steel plating up to 12mm (0.47in) thick behind, beneath and on both sides as well as up to 65mm thick glass sections, the rear gunner was provided with 6mm (.23 in) thick armour, effective only against rifle-calibre rounds.|$|E
60|$|But Almayer, plunged in {{abstracted}} thought, did {{not seem}} to want that pony any more. Amazed at this sudden indifference I turned all hands out on shore to hunt for him on my own account, or, at any rate, to hunt for the <b>canvas</b> <b>sling</b> which he had round his body. The whole crew of the steamer, with the exception of firemen and engineers, rushed up the jetty past the thoughtful Almayer and vanished from my sight. The white fog swallowed them up; and again there was a deep silence that seemed to extend for miles up and down the stream. Still taciturn, Almayer started to climb on board, and I went down from the bridge to meet him on the after deck.|$|E
5000|$|Adapting a {{ship for}} horse {{transportation}} required {{the installation of}} stalls of wood or hurdles. Detailed records of the fitting of an English fleet of 1340 show the creation of 418 hurdles, 413 iron rings and staples, canvas mangers {{and the creation of}} four gangways for loading 30 ft long by 5 wide. Similar records from 1338 show 47 ships were equipped with 134 tuns to carry water for horses. Whether English vessels used <b>canvas</b> <b>slings</b> to support the horses like contemporary Mediterranean practice is uncertain. Military historian Michael Prestwich speculates they did [...] and he is supported by naval historian Ian Friel, who believes that the references to canvas mangers referred to above should actually be translated as <b>canvas</b> <b>slings.</b>|$|R

50|$|The oared tarida {{was able}} to be loaded and {{unloaded}} directly on a beach, using doors as loading ramps. In 1174 an Italo-Norman force attacked Alexandria with 1,500 horses transported on 36 tarides. Detailed specifications for thirteenth century tarides exist, showing they could carry 20-30 horses. In Angevin tarides, horses were stalled in threes, supported by <b>canvas</b> <b>slings.</b> Genoese tarides in 1246 carried 150 water butts containing 39,750 litres in total. Sailing transports, known as usciere in Italian (French huissiers; Latin usserii), were also built. These had two decks and could carry up to 100 horses. The horses were loaded through openings in the hull, which were then sealed for the voyage. Venetian usciere built for Louis IX in 1268 were 25.76m long, had a beam of 6.1m, had two decks and two masts.|$|R

5000|$|The M1907 two-piece leather rifle sling was {{the most}} common type of sling used with the weapon through World War II. In 1943 a khaki <b>canvas</b> <b>sling</b> was {{introduced}} that gradually became more common. Another accessory was the winter trigger, developed during the Korean War. It consisted of a small mechanism installed on the trigger guard, allowing the soldier to remotely pull the trigger by depressing a lever just behind the guard. This enabled the shooter to fire his weapon while using winter gloves, which could get [...] "stuck" [...] on the trigger guard or not allow for proper movement of the finger.|$|E

Rigel's barks alerted Captain Arthur Rostron, who ordered the engines stopped and began the search for survivors. Everyone in the lifeboat was saved, and Rigel was pulled from the icy water after three hours, unaffected by the experience.The dog was too large to be pulled from the water by hand, but a seaman aboard the Carpathia, Jonas Briggs, managed to get a <b>canvas</b> <b>sling</b> under its belly, with which it was hauled aboard.|$|E
2500|$|Darren Wall (Wallzo), who {{previously}} designed the artwork for The Warning and Made in the Dark, {{was responsible for}} the album artwork for One Life Stand. As with previous Hot Chip album designs, Wall worked closely with Owen Clarke on the initial idea to reach [...] "a core aesthetic" [...] to experiment with. Wall expressed that over time the taste and influences of the band and himself [...] "are always a little bit different", which results in differing artwork. However, Wall stated that he and Clarke have [...] "hugely overlapping tastes" [...] and tend to [...] "gravitate towards 'mysterious objects' that invite interpretation" [...] such as the blocks featured on the cover of The Warning and [...] "The Artifact" [...] used for Made in the Dark. The design the duo settled on was of a suspended marble head, which was inspired by photographs of statues being lowered into place using coloured <b>canvas</b> <b>slings.</b> Wall felt this created an interesting theme due {{to the idea of a}} classical form being [...] "intersected with bright stripes of colour" [...] and the idea appealed to the band. Wall described the image and being [...] "essentially quite an over-the-top image" [...] and stated that there was [...] "plenty of Giorgio de Chirico and Hipgnosis reference" [...] in the image.|$|R
5000|$|Travelling Picture Show Men {{initially}} {{called at}} the Majestic Hall to show silent movies, but in 1923 {{the hall was}} leased by Mrs Osborne to Harold [...] "Picture" [...] Page, who obtained a theatre license that year. Herbert Page (unrelated), of Page Furnishers, was called [...] "Blue Shirt" [...] Page, to distinguish him from Picture Page. Reportedly, the early silent films in Pomona were accompanied by a schoolgirl playing random music on a pianola. On 28 April 1931 the first talkie, or movie recorded with its own soundtrack, was shown at the hall, and around 1933 the hall's lease was transferred to Ernie Bazzo, who upgraded the hall to a theatre by adding a small gallery and a bio box. A number of local social functions were shifted to the new Pomona Memorial Hall during this decade. In the late 1930s Bazzo used seating from the Princess Theatre in South Brisbane to replace the existing <b>canvas</b> <b>sling</b> seating.|$|E

50|$|Around 1590, hammocks {{were adopted}} {{for use in}} sailing ships; the Royal Navy {{formally}} adopted the <b>canvas</b> <b>sling</b> hammock in 1597. Aboard ship, hammocks were regularly employed for sailors sleeping on the gun decks of warships, where limited space prevented the installation of permanent bunks. Since a slung hammock moves {{in concert with the}} motion of the vessel, the occupant is not at a risk of being thrown onto the deck (which may be 5 or 6 feet below) during swells or rough seas. Likewise, a hammock provides more comfortable sleep than a bunk or a berth while at sea since the sleeper always stays well balanced, irrespective of the motion of the vessel. Prior to the adoption of naval hammocks, sailors would often be injured or even killed as they fell off their berths or rolled on the decks on heavy seas. The sides of traditional canvas naval hammocks wrap around the sleeper like a cocoon, making an inadvertent fall virtually impossible. Many sailors in the Royal Navy, during the 1950s at least, used a spreader - a length of wood with a V cut in each end to engage the second hammock string on each side. The first string was set up more tightly than the others so that it raised a protective lip along each side to keep out drafts and prevent the sleeper being thrown out. A narrow mattress was also issued which protected the user from cold from below. In addition naval hammocks could be rolled tightly and stowed in an out of the way place or in nets along the gunwale as additional protection during battle (as was the case during the age of sail). Many sailors became so accustomed to this way of sleeping that they brought their hammocks ashore with them on leave. The naval use of hammocks continued into the 20th century. During World War II, troopships sometimes employed hammocks for both naval ratings and soldiers in order to increase available space and troop carrying capacity. Many leisure sailors even today prefer hammocks over bunks because of better comfort in sleep while on the high seas.|$|E
40|$|Symphysial {{separation}} as {{a result}} of injury is uncommon. It has been more frequently reported as a complication ofchildbirth in the obstetrical literature and, indeed, symphysiotomy is still practised in underdeveloped countries where facilities for Caesarean section are not available. Nevertheless, it is probably more often seen in Britain after accidents. Rupture of the symphysial ligaments is a distressing condition, pain of considerable severity being aggravated by great apprehension {{even in the absence of}} major internal haemorrhage. Because there is frequently an associated disruption of the pelvic ring posteriorly, bleeding and shock can be severe. Hitherto, treatment has been predominantly conservative. Watson-Jones (1943) advocated reduction by supporting the patient in the lateral position on an orthopaedic table, the reduction being maintained by a plaster spica. This rather difficult technique was superseded by suspending the pelvis in a <b>canvas</b> <b>sling</b> (Holdsworth 1948), which is now the generally accepted method of treatment, both in this country and, with minor modifications, in other European countries (Klingenberg 1955, Lemberger 1963).
