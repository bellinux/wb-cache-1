40|$|The {{inclusion}} of fibers into a matrix over {{only a partial}} thickness of the beam is regarded as partially fiber reinforcing a beam. This concept is fully invoked in the present investigation. A tensile strain enhancement factor, t, as determined by a direct tension test, forms a convenient engineering parameter that {{takes care of the}} influence of the aspect ratio and volume fraction of the given type of fiber. The appropriate thickness of the beam section to be reinforced with fibers is computed using the above parameter. Necessary analytical expressions were developed to compute the moment enhancement factor associated with different values of the parameter, t. The validity of the approach was experimentally demonstrated. Practically similar deflection patterns for fully and partially fibrous sections were observed. The applicability of the method developed in practical situations, such as the design of airfield and highway pavements with fiber <b>conretes,</b> is cited...|$|R

The harbour was restored in 1978-79 by the Highland Council and is used today by a few crab and lobster fishermen. During the restoration works Alexander (Derry) Ross, who had spent several years at sea and was now working on the project, used his Stanley knife to carve images of fishing vessels in the <b>conrete</b> of the sea wall before it set.

That building has an [...] "eggshell" [...] shaped roof that is actually thinner (in proportion) that a real eggshell.The Frederickson Field house venue held 3,400 for basketball. Asked why the scoreboard at the Field House was the first one to have a three digit placement for the team scores, Abe Lemons, the coach at the time, said come to the first game and you will find out. Teams rarely scored in the 100s at the time (late 1950s) but in the first game at the Field House OCU beat Florida State Univ by scoring 129 points in the game. The Chiefs were to be one on the highest scoring teams in the country, scoring over 100 points a game on many occasions. A Division I team the OCU teams were an Independent team until joining the Midwestern City Conference, now known as the Horizon League. OCU dropped to NAIA status in 1985.

40|$|Steel {{bracings}} {{are among}} the most common and potentially effective technical solutions for enhancing the seismic safety of existing reinforced concrete structures. Nevertheless, several issues dealing with both analysis and design of steel bracings for retrofitting reinforced <b>conrete</b> frames remain unresolved. This paper presents a study inspired by a practical retrofitting project of a reinforced concrete frame with concentric X-bracings. Specifically, it proposes a discussion about the consequences and implications of assuming three different configurations for the steel diagonals, chosen from among the architecturally compatible ones. A detailed description of the as-built reinforced concrete frame is first presented, along with key information about the procedure followed to design the bracing diagonals. Then, after having outlined the numerical models employed to simulate the mechanical response of both concrete and steel members, the results of a series of non-linear time-history analyses are reported and discussed with the aim of highlighting the key advantages and disadvantages of adopting the three alternative bracing configurations. In this regard, particularly critical aspects, such as the actions transferred to foundations, the stresses achieved in beam-to-columns joints and the distribution of forces throughout the existing reinforced concrete members, are considered to compare the performance of the three alternative bracing patterns...|$|E
