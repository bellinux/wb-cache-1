Two experiments were experiment I (June to September 2012 growing season) and Experiment II (October to December 2012 growing season). Experimental design was a randomized block design with 2 factors and 3 replications. The first factor was soybean cultivars (Anjasmoro, Wilis, Sinabung). The second factor was N source, with Urea (50 kg/ha), Bradyrhizobium sp., farmyard manure (10 ton/ha), a combination of Bradyrhizobium sp. + farmyard manure (5 ton/ha) and <b>a</b> control with <b>no</b> <b>N.</b> <b>A</b> combined analysis of variance was done to evaluate the production and the content of isoflavone in the two different growing seasons as affected by N source and cultivar.

40|$|In this thesis, {{two samples}} of quantum dot based {{intermediate}} band solar cells were studied and compared by transmission electron microscopy. These samples were grown on a (100) GaAs substrate, {{with a general}} structure consisting of 50 InAs quantum dot layers, where each quantum dot layer was separated by a spacer layer. The {{difference between the two}} samples was that one sample had GaAs spacer layers, while the other had GaNAs spacer layers. The N was added as a strain compensator, and it was therefore expected that this sample would exhibit less defects. By bright field (BF) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) the crystal structure of both samples were studied. This showed that the sample containing <b>no</b> <b>N</b> had fewer defects, compared to the other sample. Using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron-probe micro analysis it was determined that the N content in both samples was either below the detection limit of 200 ppm or zero. The quantum dot sizes were then found for both samples by STEM and it was seen here that the sample supposedly containing N, had on average higher quantum dot sizes. The better crystal structure of the sample containing <b>no</b> <b>N,</b> were attributed to the lower average quantum dot sizes. <b>As</b> the <b>N</b> content of both samples was determined to be insignificant, the only likely cause for the difference in size where attributed to a difference in growth parameters. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy and BF imaging, the quantum dot sheet density was found. The sheet density of both samples was around 1 ^ 11 cm^(- 2), with the sample containing <b>no</b> <b>N</b> having <b>a</b> factor 2 higher density compared to the other sample. Lastly, the polarity for both samples was determined by convergent electron beam diffraction, and these results were confirmed by a high resolution STEM image. </p...|$|R

The {{results show that the}} groundwater in the study area is not entirely fit for direct drinking with respect to TDS, TH, Fe, F, Cl and SO 4 2. In some of the samples collected, the concentrations of these constituents exceed the permissible limits of the Standards for Drinking Water Quality of China. Based on TDS, 75 % of water samples are suitable for drinking and 80 % of samples are fit for drinking based on TH. Heavy metals such as As, Gr 6 +, Hg and Cd are well below the permissible limits.

40|$|International audienceField {{experiments}} were conducted at two locations during two growing {{seasons in the}} Ebro Valley (Spain), to evaluate the effects of N fertilization on yield and quality of Mediterranean-type wheat in irrigated conditions. Seven <b>N</b> treatments and <b>a</b> control were investigated. The average grain yields ranged from 2117 to 5551 kg ha- 1 depending on the year and location. Grain protein ranged from 14. 25 to 16. 9 %, and other quality parameters such as the dough strength (W) also varied with year and location, confirming the suitability of Mediterranean-type wheat and the climate {{for the production of}} good bread-making quality wheat. However, grain yields are normally low and both yields and quality can be greatly affected by the variability of this type of climate, even under irrigation. Under these conditions, grain yield increases were mainly due to {{an increase in the number}} of grains per m 2 without a reduction in the N content per spike, suggesting that N in the grain was not source-limited, possibly due to the lower grain yields and relatively high soil nitrate concentrations. In soils with lower initial soil NO- 3 N contents, better grain yields could be achieved by applying <b>a</b> <b>N</b> fertilizer rate of about 100 kg N ha- 1, whereas in soils with high initial NO- 3 <b>N</b> contents, <b>no</b> <b>N</b> or <b>a</b> maximum rate of 50 kg N ha- 1 is needed to obtain a good grain quality, showing the possibility of producing high-quality wheat with a low amount of N fertilizer and thus increasing the sustainability of the cropping system...|$|R
