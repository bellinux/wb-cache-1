40|$|Abstract: The study {{analysed}} long-term {{changes and}} the variability of the Icelandic Low and the Azores High in January and their influence on ther-mal, precipitation and nival conditions in Poland in the period 1901 – 2000. There were no statistically significant (0. 05) trends <b>of</b> analysed <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in January in the 20 th century. However, {{in the second half}} of the cen-tury the center of the Icelandic Low in January moved northwards and the sea-level pressure in the center of the Azores High increased significantly. The latter change was the reason for the significant increasing difference between the Azores High and the Icelandic Low. This change caused the intensification of western advection over Europe. Changes in sea-level pres-sure in the Icelandic Low and the longitude of the Azores High in January explain about 40 % of temperature and snow cover variability in Poland. The variability of some features <b>of</b> the <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> describes the changes of precipitation and snow cover in Poland better than the NAO index...|$|R

60|$|Many of {{the persons}} who thus took sides with Alexis, and {{encouraged}} him in his opposition to his father, had very deep designs in so doing. They were of the party who opposed the improvements and innovations which Peter had introduced, and who had in former times made the Princess Sophia their head and rallying-point in their opposition to Peter's policy. It almost always happens thus, that when, in a monarchical country, there is a party opposed to the policy which the sovereign pursues, the disaffected persons endeavor, if possible, to find a head, or leader, in some member {{of the royal family}} itself, and if they can gain to their side the one next in succession to the crown, so much the better. To this end it is for their interest to foment a quarrel in the royal family, or, if the germ of a quarrel appears, arising from some domestic or other cause, to widen the breach as much as possible, and avail themselves of the dissension to secure the name and the influence of the prince or princess thus alienated from the king as their rallying-point and <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
6000|$|But {{how does}} the flame get hold of the fuel? There is a {{beautiful}} point about that--capillary attraction[4]. [...] "Capillary attraction!" [...] you say,--"the attraction of hairs." [...] Well, never mind the name: it was given in old times, before {{we had a good}} understanding of what the real power was. It is by what is called capillary attraction that the fuel is conveyed to the part where combustion goes on, and is deposited there, not in a careless way, but very beautifully in the very midst of the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> which takes place around it. Now, I am going to give you one or two instances of capillary attraction. It is that kind of action or attraction which makes two things that do not dissolve in each other still hold together. When you wash your hands, you wet them thoroughly; you take a little soap to make the adhesion better, and you find your hand remains wet. This is by that kind of attraction of which I am about to speak. And, what is more, if your hands are not soiled (as they almost always are by the usages of life), if you put your finger into a little warm water, the water will creep a little way up the finger, though you may not stop to examine it. I have here a substance which is rather porous--a column of salt--and I will pour into the plate at the bottom, not water, as it appears, but a saturated solution of salt which cannot absorb more; so that the action which you see will not be due to its dissolving anything. We may consider the plate to be the candle, and the salt the wick, and this solution the melted tallow. (I have coloured the fluid, that you may see the action better.) You observe that, now I pour in the fluid, it rises and gradually creeps up the salt higher and higher; and provided the column does not tumble over, it will go to the top.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{quantify}} the contribution of atmospheric factors to recent off-shore sea-level variability in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea on interannual timescales. For this purpose, we statistically analysed sea-level records from tide gauges and satellite altimetry and several climatic data sets covering the last century. Previous studies had concluded that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the main pattern of atmospheric variability affecting sea level in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea in wintertime. However, we identify a different atmospheric circulation pattern that is more closely connected to sea-level variability than the NAO. This circulation pattern displays a link to sea level that remains stable through the 20 th century, in contrast to the much more variable link between sea level and the NAO. We denote this atmospheric variability mode as the Baltic Sea and North Sea Oscillation (BANOS) index. The sea-level pressure (SLP) BANOS pattern displays an SLP dipole with <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> located over (5 ° W, 45 ° N) and (20 ° E, 70 ° N) and this is distinct from the standard NAO SLP pattern in wintertime. In summertime, the discrepancy between the SLP BANOS and NAO patterns becomes clearer, with <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> the former located over (30 ° E, 45 ° N) and (20 ° E, 60 ° N).

5000|$|This work, {{most likely}} painted circa 1623 for the Amsterdam iron and weapons {{merchant}} Louis de Geer I, represents {{the story from}} Matthew 17: 24-27, in which Jesus tells Peter to catch a fish and inside he will find money to pay tribute in Capernaum. The composition is crowded, with the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> happening inside the boat. Peter and the other apostles are seen at {{the right side of}} the painting, peering down as Peter draws a fish from the water. These figures do not acknowledge the viewer. However, other figures look out of the painting at the viewer: the woman with her child and the man using an oar to launch the boat. Most figures, however, are consumed each in their own task, whether that be finding the fish, working to heave to and sail the boat, or sit as passengers awaiting the destination. The variety of human expression stems from Jordaens' studies of heads, many of which are recognizable from his other works. [...] The recent restoration treatment of the painting was accompanied by a large and fully illustrated book which goes very deep under the surface of the image and lays out the various approaches and results of the most recent research, giving a thorough picture of Jordaens, his works and his time.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} {{there was an}} overly long delay between the red and green, which caused the drivers {{to be a little}} more {{agitated}} than usual, resulting in an accident between Prost and Berger at the Mirabeau corner. The track was blocked and the race had to be stopped. At the second start everything went to plan and Senna led from Prost, Alesi, Berger, Patrese, and Boutsen, with Pirro being the first retirement when his engine blew on the opening lap. Eighth-placed Nigel Mansell was the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in the early going and he quickly got past Martini's Minardi and set off after Boutsen, but his overtaking attempt on the Belgian was less successful as he touched Boutsen's Williams at the seafront chicane and had to limp back to the pits for a new front wing. At the front Senna led comfortably, even more so after the lap 30 retirement of Prost with battery problems. There was more action on lap 35 when Piquet spun approaching Loewes Hairpin; the three time champ proceeded to stall the engine and was disqualified when he received a push start from the marshalls. While Senna maintained his lead, there was action further back where Mansell was once again charging through the field. First he cleanly disposed of Derek Warwick and then managed to successfully pass Boutsen for fourth, as Alesi and Berger fought over second place. Unfortunately for Mansell all his work went for nought as his battery failed as well. In the late stages Senna started to slow, which allowed the Alesi/Berger battle to close up on him, but Senna's McLaren would survive to the finish for his third career win at Monaco. Alesi was second, followed by Berger, Boutsen, Alex Caffi, and the only other survivor Éric Bernard, who had taken sixth place in the late stages after he had forced himself past Gregor Foitek's Onyx by pushing him into the wall. In doing so, Bernard earnt the first WDC point of his F1 career. Despite not finishing the race, Foitek was classified seventh; his best Formula One result.|$|E

He considers the pile as an electric magnet, i.e. as an attractive and repulsive agent; the poles having attractive and repelling powers. The pole from whence resinous electricity issues attracts hydrogen and repels oxygen, whilst that from which vitreous electricity proceeds attracts oxygen and repels hydrogen; so {{that each of the}} elements of a particle of water, for instance, is subject to an attractive and a repulsive force, acting in contrary directions, the <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> which are reciprocally opposed. The <b>action</b> <b>of</b> each force in relation to a molecule of water situated {{in the course of the}} electric current is in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance at which it is exerted, thus giving (it is stated) for such a molecule a constant force[B]. He explains the appearance of the elements at a distance from each other by referring to a succession of decompositions and recompositions occurring amongst the intervening particles[C], and he thinks it probable that those which are about to separate at the poles unite to the two electricities there, and in consequence become gases[D].|$|R

The main elements of the atmospheric intraseasonal variability are then presented, which controls in particular the onset of these two monsoon systems. Then the sensitivity of these two monsoon systems to oceanic and continental surface conditions {{in the context of}} interannual variability is discussed and compared. Consequences in term of predictability are commented. Finally, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 4) scenarios of the future climate over these two regions are presented.

Assuming their spatial patterns to be fixed, such modes are often described by simple indices from rather short obser-vational data sets.

40|$|Based on {{generated}} {{time series}} of the central pressure of the subtropical high, the behaviour of this atmospheric <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> has been examined since 1950 {{with regard to the}} inter-annual variations, persistence, linear trends, abrupt change, spectral analysis and interactions. The year-to-year variations in the central pressure of the subtropical high are considerable. The pronounced strengthening of the subtropical high during approximately the last 20 years is its most remarkable feature. Variations in the subtropical high’s intensity seem to follow a cyclic pattern. Statistically significant abrupt onset events are found, with the majority occurring in winter. Increasing and decreasing episodes have occurred in the late 1960 s and early 1980 s. According to spectral analysis, it can be assumed that the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> of the subtropical high is characterized by non-periodic behaviour. The peaks occur only at the lowest frequency. The quasi-biennial oscillation may affect the subtropical high in the winter season, whereas the North Atlantic Ocean may affect the subtropical high in summer. There is no detectable connection between El Niño–southern oscillation and the subtropical high in either season. The subtropical high has been affected by sea-surface temperatures of the north and south tropical Atlantic, with negative and positive signs respectively in the winter season. Interactions between the subtropical high and sea-surface temperatures over the tropical Atlantic Ocean are absent in the summer season. Copyright 2004 Roya...|$|E
