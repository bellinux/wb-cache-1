40|$|Although {{alterations}} of {{polyvinylidene fluoride}} (PVDF) membrane performance and properties in contactor applications are more severe at high temperature, to date, {{detailed information on}} the relationship between performance and properties with temperature is available. Hence, this study was undertaken to improve thermal stability of PVDF membranes by montmorillonite (MMT) incorporation. The fabricated membranes were operated in a <b>closed</b> <b>contactor</b> loop with water temperature of either 27 °C or 80 °C, followed by measuring CO 2 absorption flux before and after 2 days exposure. Higher partial pore wetting at elevated temperature resulted in performance reduction of 31 % and 13 % for plain PVDF and 5 wt% MMT-filled PVDF membrane (MMM hollow fiber), respectively. To determine the reasons, the membranes were immersed in water of 80 °C for 7 days and analyzed by analytical characterization methods after drying. It was revealed from FESEM images that large pores on the membrane surfaces became larger while the small pores became smaller, leading porous membrane surfaces to deform to semi-dense layers with small number of large pores. Furthermore, strong reductions in membrane gas permeance, porosity, contact angle and wetting resistance were detected after 7 -day immersion. Therefore, changes in the absorbent-induced membrane properties were found to be the reasons of the flux reduction at high operation temperatures. The alterations were, however, less pronounced for PVDF-filled MMT membrane than the original PVDF indicating thermal stability enhancement effect of the embedded clay particles. The results suggest that the impregnation of polymeric membranes by hydrophobic inorganic particles can be an effective method to stabilize the performance and properties of PVDF hollow fibers at harsh contactor operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The work {{is aimed}} at {{conducting}} the study to obtain the results that will quantify the influence of contactor contact pressure in power circuits of electric stock on the highest current value Id, that does not cause plastic deformation of contacts; and on the current value Ifs– incipient fusion of contacts {{taking into account the}} operation conditions. Therefore, such a study targeted to establish the contact fusing causes is relevant. Methodology. The paper proposes an engineering method for determining the currents Id and Ifs, taking into account the value of contact pressure, electrodynamic forces of contact repulsion Fe. d. r, as well as the pressure influence on the values of such forces. Findings. Taking the contactors 1 SVAD 8 (locomotive ChS 8) and 7 SP 1 (locomotive ChS 4) as an example, the authors conducted the calculations and found that the peak pressure force increases the currents Id and Ifs for these contactors by 11. 8 %; 15. 5 %; 11. 8 %; and 15. 4 % respectively (compared with the specified currents at the minimum pressure force). Influenced by Fe. d. r the pressure force of contacts for 1 SVAD 8 contactor decreased by 13. 8 … 31. 8 %, and for 7 SP 1 contactor the value Fe. d. r may be greater than the pressure force. This can lead to spontaneous shutdown of the <b>closed</b> <b>contactor</b> that is not provided by the control circuit. Ensuring during operation the maximum allowable pressure force of the contacts Fc slightly affects the value Fe. d. r, compared with the case when Fc has the minimum permissible value (in event of a fault in the heating circuit Fe. d. r for contactors 1 SVAD 8 and 7 SP 1 is reduced by only 2. 45 % and 2. 59 % respectively). Originality. The authors for the first time presented a quantitative assessment of influence of contactor contact pressure in power circuits of electric stock on their plastic deformation and fusing using the proposed engineering method. Practical value. The results obtained during the research allow solving the problem for developing measures aimed to improve the reliability of the heating circuits of electric locomotives ChS 8 and ChS 4. The proposed method of determining Id and Ifs can be used to quantify the influence of pressure of the main electric contacts mounted in power circuits of electric stock of all series, if during the operation there are cases of plastic deformation, fusing, welding of such contacts, in order to improve the reliability of power circuits...|$|E
50|$|Because arcing and {{consequent}} damage occurs {{just as the}} contacts are opening or <b>closing,</b> <b>contactors</b> are designed to open and close very rapidly; there is often an internal tipping point mechanism to ensure rapid action.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes an {{economizer}} circuit is also installed {{to reduce the}} power required to keep a contactor closed; an auxiliary contact reduces coil current after the <b>contactor</b> <b>closes.</b> A somewhat greater amount of power is required to initially <b>close</b> a <b>contactor</b> than is required to keep it closed. Such a circuit can save {{a substantial amount of}} power and allow the energized coil to stay cooler. Economizer circuits are nearly always applied on direct-current contactor coils and on large alternating current contactor coils.|$|R
50|$|The {{latter half}} of the 1960s had seen the {{widespread}} introduction of solid state electronics and these locomotives incorporated a control system where speed was detected electronically rather than mechanically. A signal from a tachogenerator was used to <b>close</b> <b>contactors</b> in sequence at given speeds to activate the motor's field weakening process, rather than through contacts and relays as in earlier types. The control system ensured the traction motors and main generator were all operated within the continuous rating of the machines except in full field conditions when the driver was able to judge how long to remain in the short-term rating condition.There were two variants of the Class 25/3 sub-class. Early 25/3 AV locomotives were fitted with vacuum brakes and in due course many of these were dual braked and redesignated 25/3 BX. By the time the last few locomotives were under construction dual braking had become the norm and ten of the last batch from Derby were built new as 25/3 BX locomotives for work out of Willesden on the recently upgraded West Coast Main Line.|$|R
50|$|Breaking {{the beam}} <b>closed</b> a <b>contactor</b> {{on to an}} 80 Volt DC supply and {{connected}} it in parallel with a service contactor. While the beam was in normal operation, a loudspeaker gave a buzzing note. When the beam was broken, the speaker reproduced the clicking of the receiver relay. An alarm buzzer also sounded and a flashing red light came on actuated by the relay. During this interruption, another <b>contactor</b> <b>closed</b> and a sentry (searchlight) was exposed across the river, on a bearing a few degrees inside {{the line of the}} infrared PE beam. The service contactor switch for the searchlight was then closed by the switchman, who carried out a quick search of the area; the control panel contactor being immediately reset by pressing a button on the control panel. Resetting stopped the alarm buzzer, flashing light and the clicking in the loudspeaker, leaving the apparatus ready to give another signature immediately.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Motivated {{by recent}} {{experiments}} on the electro-hydrodynamic instability of spin-cast polymer films, we study the undulation instability of a thin viscoelastic polymer film under in-plane stress {{and in the}} presence of either a <b>close</b> by <b>contactor</b> or an electric field, both inducing a normal stress on the film surface. We find that the in-plane stress affects both the typical timescale of the instability and the unstable wavelengths. The film stability is also sensitive to the boundary conditions used at the film-substrate interface. We have considered two conditions, either rigidly attaching the film to the substrate or allowing for slip...|$|R
50|$|The {{connection}} to loads is normally controlled through electromagnetic relays called contactors. The precharge circuit {{can be either}} power resistors connected in series with the loads until the capacitors are charged. Alternatively, a switched mode power supply connected in parallel to loads {{can be used to}} charge the voltage of the load circuit up to a level close enough to battery voltage in order to allow <b>closing</b> the <b>contactors</b> between battery and load circuit. A BMS may have a circuit that can check whether a relay is already closed before precharging (due to welding for example) to prevent inrush currents to occur.|$|R
50|$|To {{accelerate}} the train still further, the traction motors are reconnected in series-parallel connection (2 parallel circuits with 2 series-connected traction motors in each). For this purpose, in starting notch #12 the controller closes {{a pair of}} parallel contactors and opens the bridge contactor. After this the controller moves to starting notch #13, which <b>closes</b> <b>contactors</b> #1 and #2 and opens both field-weakening contactors; this assembles 2 parallel circuits, each of which comprises 2 traction motors {{and a group of}} starting resistances connected in series and has a total resistance of 4.97 ohm. Further notching out of the controller shorts out the starting resistances in pairs until in starting notch #16 all of the starting resistances are shorted out; this corresponds to running notch #3 on the engineer's controller. Moving the controller to starting notch #17 weakens the traction motor field to 67%, and in starting notch #18 the field is weakened to 50%. Starting notch #18 corresponds to running notch #4 on the engineer's controller; this is the maximum notch and allows the train to reach top speed. To coast, the engineer moves the controller handle to 0; this opens the line contactors, thereby shutting off all power to the traction motors, and moves the controller into starting notch #1 (therefore if the traction motors are turned on again, they are connected in series and all the starting resistances are in the circuit).|$|R

40|$|To {{substitute}} conventional isolation methods by {{more selective}} sorption technique, the developed sorbent {{on the base}} of acrylic monomers has been used. Synthesized ter-polymeric cation-exchanger K- 120 contains large amount of functional groups – 10. 2 mekv/g and moderately swell in water (specific swelling - 3. 2 ml/g). The regularities of lysozyme sorption onto synthesized carboxylic ion-exchanger reflux electrostatic interaction between two types of functional groups of the last and basic protein – lysozyme. Lysozyme isolation from HEW was performed using combined technique: i) sorption stage was done in static condition in <b>closed</b> agitated <b>contactor</b> and ii) for desorption sorbent was transferred into column where protein(s) were eluted by downstream process. Taking into account the practical aspect, experiments for lysozyme isolation from HEW have been conducted using different ratios of K- 120 and HEW medium. The desorbed proteins were mostly concentrated already in the first eluted volume. The content of lysozyme in eluted fractions was evaluated by their lytic activity against Micrococcus lysodeiktikus cells.

Contactors as {{low-voltage}} {{electrical products}} are largely used, contact bounce when <b>contactor</b> <b>closing</b> and arc which produces during opening {{is the main}} factor influencing a contactor’s life.

This paper designed the structure size of the electromagnetic system, used Simulink software to build the model, studied dynamic characteristics of the contacts, and obtained a new closed-loop control method at last.

40|$|The {{increase}} in water nitrogen pollution {{led to the}} improvement of the existing nitrogen removal systems and to the design of new processes. The use of a <b>closed</b> rotating biological <b>contactor</b> (RBC) is a relatively new biological wastewater treatment process. In this reactor, the accumulation of biomass in disks surface is influenced by parameters such as substrate loading rate, hydraulic retention time, number of stages, disk rotational speed and disk submergence. RBC’s have been employed for nitrogen removal. However, partially submerged disks are used for nitrification, while completely submerged disks are used for denitrification. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of disk submergence in rotating biological contactors performance, in terms of the denitrification process. Two closed RBCs were used, one with completely submerged disks and the other with 64. 5 % of submergence (RBC 1 and RBC 2 respectively). RBC 1 has a liquid volume of 16. 35 l and RBC 2 of 13 l. Both reactors were operated with a hydraulic retention time of 2 h, a rotational speed of 2 rpm and the temperature was maintained around 26 ºC by means of a water jacket. They were fed with a synthetic medium containing 50 mg N-NO 3 ˉ/l, using citrate as carbon source. A pure culture of Alcaligenes denitrificans was used as inoculum. The denitrification efficiency is expressed per unit disk area. It was observed that the completely submersed biofilm was homogeneous, light yellow over the entire surface and approximately with the same thickness. The biofilm of RBC 2 is darker and thicker in the non-immersed part and light yellow in the submersed zone. As denitrification efficiency is concerned, the RBC 1 presented a N-NO 3 ˉ removal rate/biofilm area almost twice that of RBC 2. Moreover, the biochemical analysis of the biofilm also elicits the conclusion that completely submergence is more efficient...|$|R
5000|$|The engineer's {{controller}} has 18 starting notches, {{of which}} only 4 {{are classified as}} running notches (allowing prolonged operation of the motors in this notch). Acceleration is mainly controlled by means of resistances which are initially connected into the traction motor circuit and then incrementally notched out by means of shorting with special contactors. These contactors (19 in all) are grouped together in one drum controller. The ER2 uses an indirect control system: the engineer only has to place his (or her) controller handle in the desired notch, and the control system automatically notches out the drum controller to reach that notch. (The drum controller is pneumatically operated). For slow movement, as when shunting, the engineer places the controller in the first notch, designated M ("manevrovoe", i.e. [...] "shunting"); this <b>closes</b> both line <b>contactors,</b> the bridge contactor, and contactors #7 and #8, connecting all 4 traction motors in series and engaging all of the starting resistances (total resistance 17.66 ohm). Moving the controller handle to the next notch (running notch #1) initiates an incremental notching-out (shorting-out) of the starting resistances; unlike most Russian electric locomotives, on which the engineer directly controls {{the selection of the}} starting notches, in the ER2 the intermediate starting notches are switched automatically by means of an accelerating relay which regulates the train's acceleration (by monitoring the traction current's change, see also: Traction motor#Automatic acceleration), although the engineer can override it and select the intermediate notches manually. In starting notch #9, all of the starting resistances are shorted out, and only the series-connected traction motors remain in the circuit, their fields at 100% strength. This corresponds to running notch #1 on the engineer's controller. Further notching out of the controller weakens the traction motors' field: in starting notch #10, the field strength is reduced to 67%, and in starting notch #11 to 50%. Starting notch #11 corresponds to running notch #2 on the engineer's controller.|$|R
