40|$|The natural {{shrinkage}} {{that occurs}} during the solidification of Ductile Iron can {{be offset by}} the expansion caused by the formation of graphite. Though this {{has been known for}} some time, thermal analysis has some interesting contributions to understanding exactly what is going on, and offers some opportunities for better control of late graphite expansion in moderate section sizes. Different modes of solidification are examined and measured, and the early and late graphite content are calculated using thermal analysis. <b>Carbon</b> <b>flotation</b> is seen as a fourth form of solidification that is both hypereutectic and hypoeutectic. Shrinkage is seen as a lack of late graphite growth needed to offset the natural contraction of the Ferrite. Grain boundary shrinkage can be seen as an escape mechanism for minor unfulfilled contraction. Stress relief heat treat increases the graphite volume thereby collapsing any remaining of the grain boundary shrinkage and improving fatigue life and other physical properties. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} for extracting soil microarthropods. They are generally well adapted for specific substrates and taxonomical groups. Flotation in saturated aqueous salt solutions was tested {{and should not be}} used. <b>Carbon</b> tetrachloride <b>flotation</b> and LUDOX(TM) methods were found to be unable to extract microarthropods from loamy soil samples. Therefore, a new flotation method using 1, 2 -dibromoethane (DBE) was set up. It was especially efficient for soft-bodied animals and deep soil samples, which usually are very difficult to process. The method applies to any soil with low organic content, including most cultured soils. It was found to extract five times more microarthropods and 1. 5 more taxa than a classic dry funnel method. Its absolute efficiency varied from 41 to 100 % depending on the taxa and stase. As DBE is hazardous, special precautions have to be taken when handling the product. (C) Elsevier, Paris...|$|R
40|$|Recycling {{of paper}} printed with colour laser printer xerox phaser 7700 has been {{investigated}} in this work. The recycling was performed by chemical deinking with double stage flotation with the usage of anion surfactant. Froths collected by flotation were re-floated in purpose to increase the usage of fibers. The efficiency of first flotation of magenta particles (98. 3 %), cyan (96. 9 %) and carbon ones (91. 5 %) was calculated from results of the image analysis method. The same method was not effective for {{the identification of the}} yellow toner particles. The particle size is important characteristic for flotation efficiency. The efficiency of the first flotation is the best for smallest particles (magenta) and for them the second flotation is unnecessary, while for bigger toner particles (cyan, <b>carbon)</b> second <b>flotation</b> is desirable. The efficiency of second (abf) flotation as a function of each colour (cyan 78. 0 %, magenta 58. 6 % and carbon 61. 4 %) of particle number detected by image analysis method has shown that double stage flotation is successful method of improving the usage of fibers in recycling process...|$|R
40|$|In {{the search}} for {{utilization}} of unburned <b>carbon</b> from flyash, <b>flotation</b> has been considered by many as a possible method for reclaiming the carbon. Due to the ever-increasing need to minimize landfill materials and reutilize waste streams, NETL has reviewed flyash flotation techniques {{in an effort to}} develop a methodology for determining the floatability potential of the carbonaceous material. This methodology was employed on a flyash generated from the Reliant Energy Shawville power plant. A variety of variables were adjusted in order to delineate their effects on the flotation potential of this flyash. The variables included pH, ultrasonic treatments, collector conditioning, promoters and dispersants. The techniques utilized clearly show which variables were the most important in optimizing the flotation potential for this flyash...|$|R
40|$|Title of {{the thesis}} is provocative nature. I wrote it as a {{response}} to an article published on 8 July 2016 in the daily newspaper Dnevnik (in annex). Author Marjeta Kralj named it "Iz stanovanj bo treba zmetati neustrezne peči, kamine in štedilnike", which roughly translates to "furnaces, stoves and fireplaces need to be thrown out of houses. The article states the problem of <b>carbon</b> oxides and <b>flotation</b> of fine dust particles PM 10 and PM 2, 5. In the introductory chapters I talk about stovemaking industry in Slovenia. These beginnings date as far as Emona villa and its hypocaust heating system which can be seen even today in Ljubljana archeology park. I continue by describing the possible execution of different smaller burning devices and their combinations (for example: an extra separated furnace one floor above). The percentage yield of tiled stove are above 75...|$|R
40|$|The role of gas {{nucleation}} and cavitation in flotation {{has been}} systemically studied. It was shown theoretically {{that about a}} 10 m high recovery zone is required to ensure at least one collision between a particle less than 10 $ mu$m and a bubble, under conventional column flotation conditions, indicating that the collision is the rate limiting step for fine particle flotation. Direct formation of small bubbles on the hydrophobic particle surfaces and in slurry by gas nucleation and cavitation has, therefore, been exploited {{as a way to}} accelerate the fine particle collection rate. Experimentally, the existence of gas nuclei in water was demonstrated from coagulation, sedimentation and filtration tests of fine coal (d$ sb{ 50 } approx 5 mu$m) and silica (d$ sb{ 50 } approx 3. 5 mu$m) particles. Small bubbles are generated, from the expansion of the pre-existing gas nuclei, by hydrodynamic cavitation induced by flow of liquid through a nozzle at a velocity of 8 - 15 m/s, depending on nozzle diameter and length. This velocity of bubble initiation is reduced 5 - 7 m/s when the liquid is gas-supersaturated. Surfactants do not affect the on-set of bubble formation by cavitation, but increase the amount of bubbles formed. The addition of a small amount of hydrophobic particles in gas-supersaturated systems increases the quantity of bubbles generated, while the presence of hydrophilic particles reduces bubble formation. Dissolved air (or <b>carbon</b> dioxide) <b>flotation</b> of fine silica (d$ sb{ 50 } approx 1. 6 mu$m) has shown that recovery increases with the slurry flow velocity, regardless of the saturation pressures applied (102 - 310 kPA). Releasing the gas-supersaturated slurry into a solution gives a higher recovery than releasing the gas-supersaturated slurry into a slurry. These observations suggest that bubble nucleation is a better mechanism for enhancing particle collection compared with the direct particle-bubble contact. Flotation results using a newly designed flotation reactor indicate that adding a cavitation tube and a small amount of air in the feed stream increases recovery significantly, and that bubbles formed by hydrodynamic cavitation play a role in improving flotation kinetics, {{even in the absence of}} added gas in the stream...|$|R
