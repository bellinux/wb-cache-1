Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold. Agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply for example, will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population. Fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twenty-first century. Based on the experience of countries in the Nile river basin (Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan) and other developing countries, depletion of water resources during seasons crucial for agriculture can lead to a decline in yield by up to 50%. Transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources in the future. For example, policies, practices and tools promoting <b>climate-smart</b> <b>agriculture</b> will be important, as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability. Planners and policy-makers will need to help create suitable policies that encourage funding for such agricultural transformation.|$|E

40|$|South Africa has {{stumbled}} upon a new obstacle {{before reaching the}} golden end of Nelson Mandela’s rainbow. On a global scale, climate change is hitting Africa the hardest, South Africa being no exception. With limited space, scarce supplies and poor infrastructure, livelihood development becomes a inventive challenge in the poor areas of eThekwini. Urban agriculture, seen in this research as ‘agricultural activity within the ‘intra-urban’ environment’, is a strategy deployed by the urban poor to combat these challenges. With the increasing impact of climate change on the municipality, urban agriculture as a pro-poor developmental tool is forced to overcome the {{effects of climate change}} to remain an effective developmental strategy for the many urbanites living in poverty. ‘Climate-smart agriculture’ serves as an umbrella term for this specific strategy, referring to the agricultural practices which help farmers adapt to or mitigate the effects of climate change, sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes. Although this concept is gaining popularity in rural areas all across the globe, its urban counterpart is severely underexposed in both policy and science, especially in Africa. Precisely <b>climate-smart</b> urban <b>agriculture</b> could prove to be an important tool for Durban’s municipality, its relevant stakeholders and its urban farmers to jointly engage in. So, is this joint framework actually visible in Durban?. Could it be an effective strategy for these urban farmers to climate-proof their activities. And if it has potential, how can it be promoted? This research centres around these questions, and looks for the answers by including all relevant <b>climate-smart</b> urban <b>agriculture</b> stakeholders, actors and practitioners into this debate. This is done by using questionnaires, a focus group and key-informant interviews. Also, several frameworks and approaches, such as the Sustainable Livelihoods approach, will be looked at and used in this research...|$|R

These interventions include water smart practices (rainwater harvesting, laser levelling), weather smart activities (ICT-based agromet services, index-based insurance), nitrogen and carbon smart practices (precision fertilizers, catch-cropping), energy smart (zero tillage, residue management) and knowledge smart activities (farmer-farmer learning, seed banks and cooperatives).

40|$|While {{efforts to}} adapt to the impacts of climate change have {{generally}} increased, the impression {{is that there is a}} negligible effort to include the vulnerable areas on the agenda. This paper seeks to fill in the gap by presenting an agricultural extension mechanism to tap high school students as information providers of <b>climate-smart</b> rice <b>agriculture</b> information in their rice-farming communities. This paper looks at the characteristics of the high school students who served as infomediaries as well as their information sources and perceptions on climate change; the best teaching media that can be used; and the infomediation pathways that can be drawn from this initiative. Two survey rounds, 2014 (n=) and 2015 (n=), were used as data sources. Focus group discussions and interviews were also conducted. Chi-square tests were also employed. Data show that females are more likely to be infomediaries than males. Schools serve as the primary sources of information on climate change, and students generally equate climate change to extreme weather events such as drought. Various teaching media explored seem to be useful in various development contexts. Teachers are seen as the champions of this initiative. Hence, this initiative rests heavily on the extent of capacity enhancement that can be extended to the teachers so they are in a better position to train their students in the future...|$|R

30|$|Climate change (CC) is {{an urgent}} and highly {{relevant}} topic {{that must be}} integrated into the school curriculum. Literature on CC integration, however, is scarce, let alone literature on integrating <b>climate-smart</b> rice <b>agriculture</b> (CSRA). Bringing CSRA lessons into the classroom means the chance is higher that climate-smart technologies on rice will reach even the most far-flung areas of the Philippines, which stand to be among the most vulnerable as regards the negative impacts of CC. This paper shares experiences drawn from three high schools in the Philippines on integrating CSRA into their curriculum. The research centers on appropriate teaching tools/strategies, push and exogenous factors in CSRA integration, and the types of information that are likely to be shared by the students with their farmer-parents or other farmers in their communities. Surveys among participating students (n =  155) and three focus group discussions among key school officials were conducted. Different teaching methods and/or tools were found to be generally useful in various contexts. Photos and videos, however, emerged as the most effective tools across sites. The livelihood source of the students does have a bearing on the complexity of messages that they can convey. Students from rice-farming households can competently discuss even highly complex adaptation and mitigation information with their farmer-parents or other farmers. Thorough message-framing is necessary to maximize student involvement as well as to increase production of education–entertainment (edutainment) materials to be utilized in teaching. This study, in general, contributes to CC education by bringing in best-fit practices in teaching tools and strategies to mobilize students to act on urgent matters relating to the impacts of CC. It also advises on considering exogenous factors that might affect CC education by taking into account those that are equally capable of shaping students’ perception and knowledge.|$|R

40|$|Given {{its heavy}} {{reliance}} on rainfed agriculture and projected climatic and weather changes, SSA faces multidimensional challenges in ensuring food and nutrition security as well as preserving its ecosystems. In this regard, <b>climate-smart</b> <b>agriculture</b> (CSA) {{can play an important}} role in addressing the interlinked challenges of food security and climate change. CSA practices aim to achieve three closely related objectives: sustainably increase agricultural productivity, adapt to climate change, and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The CSA objectives directly contribute to achieving the 2014 Malabo Declaration goals, which include commitments to (1) end hunger in Africa by 2025, (2) halve poverty by 2025 through inclusive agricultural growth and transformation, and (3) enhance the resilience of livelihoods and production systems to climate variability and other related risks. These linkages underscore the importance of including CSA in country and regional plans to achieve overarching development objectives in Africa, in particular food security and poverty reduction. The 2016 Annual Trends and Outlook Report (ATOR) examines the contribution of CSA to meeting Malabo Declaration goals by taking stock of current knowledge on the effects of climate change, reviewing existing evidence of the effectiveness of various CSA strategies, and discussing examples of CSA-based practices and tools for developing evidence-based policies and programs.

40|$|We {{offer some}} {{perspective}} on the <b>climate-smart</b> <b>agriculture</b> movement, which arose from a proposal by world agriculture stakeholders in the international climate negotiation process. As early as 1992, agricultural production {{was seen as a}} central issue in the negotiations, but one that was too politically charged for international coordination to make progress in that area. The <b>climate-smart</b> <b>agriculture</b> concept has more recently been based on the wager of 'triple win' solutions in agricultural productivity, climate change adaptation and greenhouse gas emission reduction. Each of these three dimensions corresponds to an issue within the negotiations (fight against poverty, food security, climate change mitigation) that has its own playing field and players, both nationally and internationally. The <b>climate-smart</b> <b>agriculture</b> concept cannot hide the fact that individual actions can never address all of the issues and that some crucial ones will inevitably be subject to political arbitration in situations where the stakeholders have unequal resources. We thus advocate that <b>climate-smart</b> <b>agriculture</b> initiatives explicitly clarify their political agenda and their underlying agricultural sector transformation pathways. That appears essential both at the national level and to facilitate international dialogue on climate strategies in agriculture, in line with the climate agreement expected in Paris in 2015. In conclusion, we give some thought to the crucial role of science, which should not seek to depoliticize but rather to help structure the political debate and effective international coordination.

40|$|Agriculture is the {{backbone}} of West African economies, providing employment and income to about 70 % of the population. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is cognizant of the important role that the sector plays for its member states and the challenges posed by climate change. Therefore, ECOWAS decided to promote <b>Climate-Smart</b> <b>Agriculture</b> (CSA) within its regional agriculture promotion policy, and developed a CSA implementation framework. The CSA implementation framework aims to increase productivity and farm incomes sustainably and equitably, enhance adaptation and resilience to climate variability and change, and to control and/or reduce greenhouse gas emissions wherever possible and appropriate. In order to translate {{the aims of the}} CSA implementation framework into action, ECOWAS, together with partners including CCAFS launched a West African Alliance for <b>Climate-Smart</b> <b>Agriculture.</b> The Alliance is the consultation, coordination, convergence, funding and monitoring framework of the CSA implementation framework. The Alliance brings together Government agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations, farmer organizations, private sector, international organizations and other agencies in a voluntary and inclusive multi-stakeholder partnership.

These studies were based on an analysis of farmers' strategies to cope with climate change and variability, while also relying on modelling in the case of Burkina Faso. We highlight that these solutions should be dovetailed with existing strategies. The range of adaptation mechanisms used by farmers in Colombia influenced their agroclimatic information needs.
