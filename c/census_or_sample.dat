A method of collecting longitudinal demographic data {{was introduced in}} southern Mozambique since 1996 (DSS -Demographic Surveillance System in Manhiça district, Maputo province), but {{the extent to which}} it yields demographic measures that are typical of southern rural Mozambique has not been evaluated yet. Methods Data from the DSS were used to estimate the levels and trends of fertility, mortality and migration in Manhiça, between 1998 and 2005. The estimates from Manhiça were compared with estimates from Maputo province using the 1997 National census and 1997 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The DHS data were used to estimate levels and trends of adult mortality using the siblings' histories and the orphanhood methods. Results The populations in Manhiça and in Maputo province are young (44 % Conclusion The population under demographic surveillance in Manhiça district presents characteristics that are typical of southern rural Mozambique, with predominance of young people and reduction of adult males. Labour migration and excess adult male mortality are the major factors for the reduction of adult males. Mortality is high and only infant mortality has started to stabilise while adult mortality has increased, and as consequence, life expectancy has decreased. The Manhiça DSS is an adequate tool to report demographic measures for southern rural Mozambique. </p...|$|E

40|$|Labor {{market survey}} (LMS) {{as used in}} {{rehabilitation}} and dis-ability services {{has been defined as}} “a survey methods strategy to collect qualitative and/or quantitative data for a small popu-lation <b>census</b> <b>or</b> <b>sample</b> about an identified labor market in order to draw inferences to the client/evaluee (N = 1) ” (Bar-ros-Bailey, 2011, in press). There are generally three phases in the rehabilitation counseling process where LMS is used— vocational exploration, plan development, and job placement. In vocational exploration and plan development, inferences from LMSs might be distal from the client and involve exam-ining a variety of potential occupations and their relevant labor market factors important to establishing a vocational goal and developing a rehabilitation plan and justification. In this instance, the inference is how the occupation(s) or job classification meet(s) an assessment of the needs, skills, and/ or interests of the individual. The intended outcome at these phases is typically a plan. For the job placement phase, the LMS information may be used more for establishing relation-ships with employers or identifying job opportunities within the labor market. For this phase, the immediate inference is very proximal to the client; that is, the information is used in the direct match between the abilities of a single individual and the work activities, requirements, and demands of a single or small pool of available positions. The intended outcome at this phase is placement and integration of an individual with a disability into the world of work. It has been established by Neulicht, Gann, Berg, and Taylor (2007) and confirmed by Barros-Bailey (2011, in press) that there exists little in the lit-erature on the use and practice of LMS in rehabilitation and disability services; thus, LMS may arguably depict a profes-sional area of rehabilitation counseling that is mainly carried forth by oral tradition in education, training, and practice...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} tendency to take a spatial perspective in analysing <b>census</b> <b>or</b> <b>sample</b> data. This thesis contributes {{to the development of}} spatial analysis and concentrates on methods for analysing data on social characteristics. The important case of aggregated census data will be considered. If we are interested in spatial relationships, then we must consider how to analyse social data that have been obtained by methods of sampling or aggregation. There may not be a direct interest in spatial relationships, but the presence of spatial interdependence may still need {{to be taken into account}} in the analysis. There may be spatial trends in means and variances, and the correlation between the characteristics of different individuals that depend on their relative locations. The main outputs of the thesis have contributed in the development of the analysis of aggregate social data from a spatial perspective, in particular using semivariogram analysis. Some outputs are outlined The role of the semivariogram and cross-semivariogram of the aggregate data is to explore and explain covariance structure and spatial dependency in the population. This includes the relationship between spatial autocorrelation and the variogram. The connection between the variogram of the aggregated data and the variogram of the unit level data, which leads to the development of a non-linear model of the group level semivariogram to provide estimates of the individual level semivariogram model parameters. The extension into the bivariate case involving cross-semivariogram analysis is discussed. The MAUP as an analysis tool to explore spatial dependence of aggregate social data is discussed. Simulation results empirical analysis of actual aggregate data are implemented to confirm the methods. The empirical work is based on analysis of the 1991 Australian Census of Population and Housing. The thesis shows the role of semivariogram analysis (univariate case) and cross-semivariogram analysis (bivariate case) in understanding the aggregation effect for social data. The aggregation effect, which includes the two main aspects of the scaling effect and zoning effect, is mainly determined by the presence of dependency within the data. Another factor is existence of the relationship between group size and within group variation...|$|E

This {{study examines}} current {{practice in the}} curation of social survey data in African countries and makes suggestions for future improvements in this regard. Curation of data refers to its preservation and management for reuse. Utilising survey data {{for the study of}} social phenomena other than those for which the original survey was initiated is a relatively new research approach in Africa. Thus best practice for this type of research is still being put in place by African organisations. This involves the development of optimal means of processing and storing the data for re-use. Of concern to this study is what constitutes the most effective way of managing and sharing the information garnered from these surveys as a resource for economic and social development in Africa. Social survey data refers to both the statistical information which is the final product of <b>censuses</b> <b>or</b> <b>sample</b> surveys, and the documentation provided with the data to facilitate its reuse. Documentation includes technical notes and questionnaires used in the survey process, as well as meta data (detailed information about the data) and reports produced concerning the final survey findings. The research looks at the history of the management of social survey data worldwide and in African countries, and the policies and processes involved in curating survey information in these countries. The comparative component of the study examines developments in this field internationally and compares these to practices on the African continent. International best practice in the field has been used to evaluate current methods of survey data archiving in African countries. The study presents strategies to ensure the optimal preservation and effective sharing of survey data among countries of the region.

The analysis unit of this {{research is}} the entire staff of civil servants at Dinas Pendapatan Daerah (Local Revenue Office) of South Kalimantan Province, excluding the civil servants as well as part-time workers of the Unit Pelayanan Pendapatan Daerah (Service Unit of Local Revenue). The samples of this research are taken through <b>census</b> <b>or</b> saturated <b>sampling</b> method in which all population of the research which consisting of 88 employees are taken as the sample of this research. The data of this research are collected by using questionnaires, namely by providing a list of direct questions to the respondents. The variables of the research are measured through Likert scale. The data are then analyzed by using SPPS multiple linear regression analysis technique. The result of  individual parameter sifnificance test (t-test) shows that (i) there is positive or significant influence of job satisfaction on work performance, (ii) there is positive or significant influence of salary satisfaction on works performance, (iii) there is positive or significant influence of promotion-opportunity satisfaction on works performance, (iv) there is positive or significant influence of supervision satisfaction on works performance, (v) there is positive or significant influence of co-workers/colleagues satisfaction on works performance. Additionally, the result of simultaneous test (F-test) shows that the score of F- value is greater than the score of F-table, with the confidence level at 95 %. This means that there is simultaneous positive or significant influence of job satisfaction, salary satisfaction, promotion-opportunities satisfaction, supervision satisfaction dimension, and co- workers/colleagues satisfaction on work performance of the civil servants at Dinas Pendapatan Daerah (Local Revenue Office) of South Kalimantan Province.

50|$|Typically a {{population}} is very large, making a <b>census</b> <b>or</b> a complete enumeration of all the values in that population infeasible. A 'sample' thus forms a manageable subset of {{a population}}. In positivist research, statistics derived from a sample are analysed in order to draw inferences regarding {{the population as a}} whole. The process of collecting information from a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. Sampling methods may be either 'random' (random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified <b>sampling,</b> cluster <b>sampling)</b> <b>or</b> non-random/nonprobability (convenience <b>sampling,</b> purposive sampling, snowball sampling). The most common reason for sampling is to obtain information about a population. Sampling is quicker and cheaper than a complete census of a population.|$|R
