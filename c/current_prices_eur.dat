The main {{objective is to}} suggest a fair value for the share in order to ultimately support a buy, hold or sell recommendation vis a vis the market value as per November 4 th 2016. The dissertation first provides an introduction over the methods commonly used in equity valuation. Afterwards, the industry dynamics and new consumption trends are assessed. Additionally, {{the company and its}} business model are analysed in detail as well. The following step is valuation. A DCF approach was performed to value Telepizza which was complemented with a relative analysis. Both methods supported the same recommendation. Finally, a conclusion section summarizes what investors should take away from this dissertation. A one-page investment case is also provided where the reader may easily understand the view this dissertation supports on Telepizza share. This dissertation issues a BUY recommendation with a Fair Value of EUR 4. 93 per share, implying a 15 % upside to the <b>current</b> market <b>price</b> of <b>EUR</b> 4. 30 per share.

These were examined under scenarios where information on moisture in <b>current</b> <b>prices</b> is limited and under a scenario where <b>current</b> <b>prices</b> reflect Full Knowledge of moisture advantages. Results indicate that changing to a nil moisture basis (which requires a subsequent adjustment in volumes to reflect the subtraction of moisture) would increase reported prices from 42 to 70 c/bu for the wheat classes, while changing to a 12 percent constant moisture basis would have limited impacts on reported prices. Effects on relative prices/revenue depend on whether knowledge of moisture advantages are reflected in <b>current</b> <b>prices.</b> If <b>current</b> <b>prices</b> reflect moisture advantages (Full Knowledge), then relative effects on prices/revenues are minimal.
