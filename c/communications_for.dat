5|$|June 27, 1933 - A minimal {{hurricane}} {{moves through}} northeastern Venezuela. The hurricane destroys several houses, businesses, and fishing boats.

5|$|Composite {{materials}} make up 43% of the airframe, and the proprotor blades {{also use}} composites. For storage, the V-22's rotors fold in 90 seconds and its wing rotates to align, front-to-back, with the fuselage. Due to {{the requirement for}} folding rotors, their 38-foot diameter is 5 feet less than optimal for vertical takeoff, resulting in high disk loading. Most missions use fixed wing flight 75% {{or more of the}} time, reducing wear and tear and operational costs. This fixed wing flight is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range line-of-sight <b>communications</b> <b>for</b> improved command and control.|$|E

The floods also damaged 4,000-6,000 homes and {{buildings}} and significantly disrupted water and <b>communications</b> <b>for</b> {{an extended period of}} time. The hurricane's storm surge damaged many boats and yachts in ports along the peninsula's coast, most of them beyond repair. Minor beach erosion was reported at San Felipe, Baja California. As a result, the Baja California Sur municipalities of La Paz, Los Cabos, Loreto, Comondú, and Mulegé were declared national disaster areas. 6,000 people were affected and total damage from the storm was $100 million.|$|E

5|$|TouchWave, Inc. (now WebCom), was {{a privately}} held Palo Alto, California IP-telephony network switch {{provider}} founded in 1997. TouchWave developed a product line called WebSwitch {{that was designed}} to replace traditional private telephone exchange systems in small-to-medium-sized companies. WebSwitch was part of a phone system that incorporates communication features provided by the Internet. The rapid success of TouchWave was memorialized with awards and an acquisition by Ericsson <b>Communications</b> <b>for</b> $46M two years after TouchWave was founded. Ericsson continued the TouchWave product line under the name WebCom, but its efforts have been viewed as less than successful.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Nødnett, Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police, fire departments and paramedics, all based on analog radio. The old system had two main downsides: it was not encrypted, and it prevented communication between agencies. This was particularly problematic in larger disasters and accidents, and in instances where criminals listened to the police radio during police actions. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate had also instructed the agencies to encrypt their <b>communications</b> <b>for</b> reasons of privacy. This would either have to be done through an expensive upgrade to the existing systems, or through the construction of a new, digital network.|$|E

They participated {{in a number of}} battles, including the Battle of Baghdad in March 1917 and the Battle of Ramadi in September that year. Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Caucasus Front collapsed, leaving Central Asia open to the Turkish Army. A special force, known as Dunsterforce after its commander, Major General Lionel Dunsterville, was formed from hand-picked British officers and NCOs to organise any remaining Russian forces or civilians who were ready to fight the Turkish forces. Some 20 Australian officers served with Dunsterforce in the Caucasus Campaign and one party under Captain Stanley Savige was instrumental in protecting thousands of Assyrian refugees. Australian nurses staffed four British hospitals in Salonika, and another 10 in India.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{authorities}} apparently appreciated Vizzini, {{because he}} had opposed the Fascists and yielded substantial political power on the island. As far as Vizzini was concerned, he liked to boast about his excellent contacts with the Americans, and underlined {{their support for the}} separatist movement. Vizzini would become an important player {{in the midst of the}} separatist crisis later on. The Americans seem to have treated Vizzini as the Mafia’s overall boss. The OSS relied on the Mafia, and in particular on Vizzini, for its intelligence. His codename was ‘Bull Frog’ in secret <b>communications.</b> <b>For</b> a while, the chief of the OSS Palermo office, Joseph Russo, met him and other Mafia bosses ‘at least once a month’.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Internet and {{international}} telephone service in Ürümqi remained limited {{for nearly a}} year after the riots. As late as November, most of the Internet was still inaccessible to residents and international phone calls were impossible; as late as December, most web content hosted outside the autonomous region remained off-limits to all but a few journalists, and residents had to travel to Dunhuang 14 hours away to access the Internet normally. Within the city, only about 100 local sites, such as banks and regional government websites, could be accessed. Both incoming and outgoing international phone calls were disallowed, so Ürümqi residents could only communicate by calling intermediaries in other cities in China who would then place the international calls. The communications blackout generated controversy even within China: Yu Xiaofeng of Zhejiang University criticised the move, and many Ürümqi locals said it hurt businesses and delayed recovery, whereas David Gosset of the Euro-China forum argued that the government had the right to shut down <b>communications</b> <b>for</b> the sake of social stability; some locals believed that getting away from the Internet even improved their quality of life.|$|E
