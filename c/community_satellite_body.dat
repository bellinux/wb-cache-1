40|$|The Danish Ørsted {{satellite}} {{will carry}} four science experiments into an elliptical, polar, low earth orbit. Objectives are {{to map the}} Earth’s magnetic field, measure the charged particle environment and collect occultation data. The science data from the 14 month mission will improve geomagnetic models study the auroral phenomena and obtain atmospheric profiles. 75 scientific groups in 17 countries have responded to an announcement of opportunity to analyze the Ørsted data. A triaxial fluxgate magnetometer aligned with a star imager and an Overhauser magnetometer are mounted on an 8 meter long deployable boom. The science payload also includes six charged particle detectors mounted in the <b>satellite</b> <b>body.</b> The extended boom provides gravity-gradient passive altitude control. Active altitude control is maintained using magnetorquer coils. Position is determined by redundant GPS receivers. The <b>satellite</b> <b>body</b> weighs 60 kg and is 680 mm X 450 mm X 340 mm. Modular electronic boxes accommodate all electronics except for the two GPS receivers and the star-imager electronics, which are located in special boxes. The Ørsted satellite will be launched as an auxiliary payload on a Delta II launch vehicle from Vandenberg Air force Base, California, together with the P 91 - 1 /Argos satellite in early 1996.

30|$|Each Swarm {{satellite}} {{carries an}} accelerometer and GPS receiver {{as part of}} its scientific payload. Each accelerometer keeps a cubic proof-mass levitated {{in the center of a}} slightly larger cavity (Fedosov and Pereštý 2011; Zadražil 2011). The levitation is achieved by applying control voltages to six pairs of electrodes located on the inner walls of the cavity. The control voltages are representative for the acceleration of the proof-mass relative to the cavity. Since the cavity is firmly attached to the <b>satellite</b> <b>body</b> at the <b>satellite’s</b> center of mass, these accelerations are also representative for the non-gravitational accelerations acting on the satellites.|$|R
