50|$|Platinum {{nanoparticles}} {{are typically}} synthesized {{either by the}} reduction of platinum ion precursors in solution with a stabilizing or <b>capping</b> <b>agent</b> to form colloidal nanoparticles, or by the impregnation and reduction of platinum ion precursors in a micro-porous support such as alumina.|$|E
50|$|Silver nanocubes can be {{synthesized}} using {{ethylene glycol}} as a reducing agent and PVP as a <b>capping</b> <b>agent,</b> in a polyol synthesis reaction (vide supra).

Three organic <b>capping</b> <b>agents</b> were used: trimethyl(tetradecyl) ammonium bromide (TTAB), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and sodium 3 -mercapto- 1 -propanesulfonate (SMPS).

By applying PBH <b>capping</b> <b>agents</b> with different structures, the physico-chemical properties of AuNPs can be manipulated, thus affording tunability in diverse environments.|$|R
40|$|Water-soluble CuS nanocrystals and {{nanorods}} {{were prepared}} by reacting copper acetate with thioacetamide {{in the presence}} of different surfactants and <b>capping</b> <b>agents.</b> The size of the nanocrystals varied from 3 - 20 nm depending on the reaction parameters such as concentration, temperature, solvent and the <b>capping</b> <b>agents.</b> The formation of nanocrystals was studied by using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy...|$|R
50|$|The polyol {{process is}} a {{particularly}} useful method because it yields {{a high degree of}} control over both the size and geometry of the resulting nanoparticles. In general, the polyol synthesis begins with the heating of a polyol compound such as ethylene glycol, 1,5-pentanediol, or 1,2-propylene glycol7. An Ag+ species and a <b>capping</b> <b>agent</b> are added (although the polyol itself is also often the <b>capping</b> <b>agent).</b> The Ag+ species is then reduced by the polyol to colloidal nanoparticles. The polyol process is highly sensitive to reaction conditions such as temperature, chemical environment, and concentration of substrates. Therefore, by changing these variables, various sizes and geometries can be selected for such as quasi-spheres, pyramids, spheres, and wires. Further study has examined the mechanism for this process as well as resulting geometries under various reaction conditions in greater detail.|$|E
50|$|In this way, the {{material}} can be printed onto a substrate using {{a wide range}} of printing techniques, even in roll-to-roll processes. Once printed, the CIGS/CIS materials are heated to remove the organic <b>capping</b> <b>agent,</b> which destroys the quantum confinement associated with the nanoparticles and provides for a p-type semiconductor film possessing the desired crystalline structure.|$|E
50|$|As the {{platinum}} metal precursor {{is reduced to}} neutral {{platinum metal}} (Pt0), the reaction mixture becomes supersaturated with platinum metal and the Pt0 begins to precipitate {{in the form of}} nanoscale particles. A <b>capping</b> <b>agent</b> or stabilizing agent such as sodium polyacrylic acid or sodium citrate is often used to stabilize the nanoparticle surfaces, and prevents the aggregation and coalescence of the nanoparticles.|$|E

Particle sizes estimated from X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis are 3. 75 nm and 2. 60 nm for ZnS/PVA and ZnS/MA respectively. The estimated energy band gap of the capped ZnS nanoparticles showed blue shift of 0. 60 eV and 1. 00 eV for ZnS/PVA and ZnS/MA respectively. The vibrational modes associated with OH-stretching and –COOH from the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements confirm the presence of the <b>capping</b> <b>agents.</b> </p...|$|R
30|$|Colloidal {{metallic}} nanoparticles, {{particularly in}} the absence of counteracting force, are attracted to each other by the van der Waals force [50, 51]. Consequently, overcoming this attractive force {{is one of the great}} challenges to control the morphology of nanoparticles. There are several types of <b>capping</b> <b>agents</b> to balance these attraction forces by electrostatic stabilization and/or steric stabilization. The type of <b>capping</b> <b>agents</b> depends on the kind of metal, expected morphology, and the application of the resultant nanoparticles.|$|R
5000|$|Platinum {{nanoparticles}} {{can also}} be synthesized by decomposing Pt2(dba)3 (dba = dibenzylideneacetone) under a CO or H2 atmosphere, {{in the presence of}} a <b>capping</b> <b>agent.</b> [...] The size and shape distributions of the resulting nanoparticles depend on the solvent, the reaction atmosphere, the types of capping agents and their relative concentrations, the specific platinum ion precursor, as well at the temperature of the system and reaction time.|$|E
5000|$|The size of {{nanoparticles}} synthesized colloidally may {{be controlled}} by changing the platinum precursor, the ratio of <b>capping</b> <b>agent</b> to precursor, and/or the reaction temperature. [...] The size of the nanoparticles can also be controlled with small deviation by using a stepwise seed-mediated growth procedure as outlined by Bigall et al. (2008). [...] The size of nanoparticles synthesized onto a substrate such as alumina depends on various parameters such as the pore size of the support.|$|E
50|$|Platinum {{nanoparticles}} {{of controlled}} {{shape and size}} have also been accessed through varying the ratio of polymer <b>capping</b> <b>agent</b> concentration to precursor concentration. Reductive colloidal syntheses as such have yielded tetrahedral, cubic, irregular-prismatic, icosahedral, and cubo-octahedral nanoparticles, whose dispersity is also dependent on the concentration ratio of <b>capping</b> <b>agent</b> to precursor, and which may be applicable to catalysis. The precise mechanism of shape-controlled colloidal synthesis is not yet known; however, {{it is known that}} the relative growth rate of crystal facets within the growing nanostructure determines its final shape. Polyol syntheses of platinum nanoparticles, in which chloroplatinic acid is reduced to PtCl42− and Pt0 by ethylene glycol, have also been a means to shape-controlled fabrication. Addition of varying amounts of sodium nitrate to these reactions was shown to yield tetrahedra and octahedra at high concentration ratios of sodium nitrate to chloroplatinic acid. Spectroscopic studies suggest that nitrate is reduced to nitrite by PtCl42− early in this reaction, and that the nitrite may then coordinate both Pt(II) and Pt(IV), greatly slowing the polyol reduction and altering the growth rates of distinct crystal facets within the nanoparticles, ultimately yielding morphological differentiation.|$|E

40|$|The {{achievement}} of high information density and fast recording rate in memory devices crucially {{depends on the}} structure of magnetic domains. In this paper cobalt nanoparticles are synthesised using two <b>capping</b> <b>agents</b> (TOA, ODA) and two different preparation routes: thermal decomposition (TD) and Solvated Metal Atom Dispersion (SMAD). The interaction of <b>capping</b> <b>agents</b> with free metal clusters and their influence on Co nanoparticles size, atomic structure and oxidation state is investigated by means of X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy...|$|R
30|$|Smaller-sized AuNPs, 1 to 5 nm, {{are usually}} {{prepared}} by borohydride {{reduction in the}} presence of thiol <b>capping</b> <b>agents</b> [19]. Disadvantages of this method include the use of toxic organic solvents and the potential presence of impurities introduced by using <b>capping</b> <b>agents,</b> which can also hinder the surface modification and functionality of particles for particular applications [20]. Also, AuNPs have been synthesized using formaldehyde as a reducing agent. One disadvantage is that formaldehyde is toxic, and the excess formaldehyde in the solution leads to solution instability and eventual particle aggregation [13].|$|R
5000|$|Range and {{direction}} of growth can be controlled by nanoseed, concentration of metal precursor, ligand, and reaction conditions (heat, pressure, etc.). [...] Controlling stoichiometric conditions of growth solution controls ultimate size of particle. For example, a low concentration of metal seeds to metal precursor in the growth solution will produce larger particles. <b>Capping</b> <b>agent</b> {{has been shown to}} control direction of growth and thereby shape. Ligands can have varying affinities for binding across a particle. Differential binding within a particle can result in dissimilar growth across particle. This produces anisotropic particles with nonspherical shapes including prisms, cubes, and rods.|$|E
5000|$|Nitrate reductase was {{suggested}} to initiate nanoparticle formation by many fungi including Penicillium species, while several enzymes, α-NADPH-dependent reductases, nitrate-dependent reductases and an extracellular shuttle quinone, were implicated in silver nanoparticle synthesis for Fusarium oxysporum. Jain et al. (2011) indicated that silver nanoparticle synthesis for A. flavus occurs initially by a [...] "33kDa" [...] protein {{followed by a}} protein (cystein and free amine groups) electrostatic attraction which stabilizes the nanoparticle by forming a <b>capping</b> <b>agent.</b> Intracellular silver and gold nanoparticle synthesis is not fully understood but similar fungal cell wall surface electrostatic attraction, reduction, and accumulation has been proposed. External gold nanoparticle synthesis by P. chrysosporium was attributed to laccase, while intracellular gold nanoparticle synthesis was attributed to ligninase.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method of}} silver {{nanoparticle}} synthesis includes {{the use of}} reducing sugars with alkali starch and silver nitrate. The reducing sugars have free aldehyde and ketone groups, which enable them to be oxidized into gluconate. The monosaccharide must have a free ketone group because in order {{to act as a}} reducing agent it first undergoes tautomerization. In addition, if the aldehydes are bound, it will be stuck in cyclic form and cannot act as a reducing agent. For example, glucose has an aldehyde functional group that is able to reduce silver cations to silver atoms and is then oxidized to gluconic acid. The reaction for the sugars to be oxidized occurs in aqueous solutions. The <b>capping</b> <b>agent</b> is also not present when heated.|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} the {{synthesis}} of chemically modified cyclodextrins bearing polyamine pendant groups, potentially useful as <b>capping</b> <b>agents</b> for the preparation of nanosized metal systems or as auxiliaries for gene transfection, the reaction between the heptakis-(6 -iodo) -(6 -deoxy) -b-cyclodextrin and various polyamines has been explored. This synthetic approach allows obtaining materials constituted by mixtures of cyclodextrins, having different degrees of substitution, which were satisfactorily characterized by means of various complementary techniques (ESI-MS, NMR, potentiometric titration). The products obtained were successfully subjected to preliminary tests for their binding abilities towards suitable organic guests and as <b>capping</b> <b>agents</b> for the preparation of stable silver nanoparticles...|$|R

50|$|Ramirez et al. {{reported}} {{the influence of}} ligand and solvent effects on {{the size and shape}} of platinum nanoparticles. Platinum nanoparticle seeds were prepared by the decomposition of Pt2(dba)3 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) under carbon monoxide (CO). These conditions produced Pt nanoparticles with weakly bound THF and CO ligands and an approximate diameter on 1.2 nm. Hexadecylamine (HDA) was added to the purified reaction mixture and allowed to displace the THF and CO ligands over the course of approximately seven days, producing monodispersed spherical crystalline Pt nanoparticles with an average diameter of 2.1 nm. After the seven-day period, an elongation of the Pt nanoparticles occurred. When the same procedure was followed using a stronger <b>capping</b> <b>agent</b> such as triphenyl phosphine or octanethiol, the nanoparticles remained spherical, suggesting that the HDA ligand affects particle shape.|$|E
50|$|Generally, gold {{nanoparticles}} {{are produced}} in a liquid ("liquid chemical methods") {{by reduction of}} chloroauric acid (HAuCl4). After dissolving HAuCl4, the solution is rapidly stirred while a reducing agent is added. This causes Au3+ ions to be reduced to Au+ions. Then a disproportionation reaction occurs whereby 3 Au+ ions give rise to Au3+ and 2 Au0 atoms. The Au0 atoms act as center of nucleation around which further Au+ ions gets reduced. To prevent the particles from aggregating, some sort of stabilizing agent that sticks to the nanoparticle surface is usually added. In the Turkevich method of Au NP synthesis, citrate initially acts as the reducing agent and finally as the <b>capping</b> <b>agent</b> which stabilizes the Au NP through electrostatic interactions between the {{lone pair of electrons}} on the oxygen and the metal surface. Also, gold colloids can be synthesised without stabilizers by laser ablation in liquids.|$|E
50|$|Nanoparticles {{can also}} be formed using {{radiation}} chemistry. Radiolysis from gamma rays can create strongly active free radicals in solution. This relatively simple technique uses a minimum number of chemicals. These including water, a soluble metallic salt, a radical scavenger (often a secondary alcohol), and a surfactant (organic <b>capping</b> <b>agent).</b> High gamma doses {{on the order of}} 104 Gray are required. In this process, reducing radicals will drop metallic ions down to the zero-valence state. A scavenger chemical will preferentially interact with oxidizing radicals to prevent the re-oxidation of the metal. Once in the zero-valence state, metal atoms begin to coalesce into particles. A chemical surfactant surrounds the particle during formation and regulates its growth. In sufficient concentrations, the surfactant molecules stay attached to the particle. This prevents it from dissociating or forming clusters with other particles. Formation of nanoparticles using the radiolysis method allows for tailoring of particle size and shape by adjusting precursor concentrations and gamma dose.|$|E
40|$|The {{mobility}} and deposition of capped silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) on silica surfaces were characterized {{over a wide}} range of pH and ionic strength (IS) conditions, including seawater and freshwater. Two common organic <b>capping</b> <b>agents</b> (citrate and PVP) were evaluated. Both the capped Ag NPs and the silica surfaces were negatively charged under these environmentally relevant conditions, resulting in net repulsive electrostatics under most conditions. The steric repulsion introduced by the <b>capping</b> <b>agents</b> significantly reduced aggregation and deposition. In addition, the presence of natural organic matter in solution further decreased the deposition of either Ag NP on silica. Ag NPs were found to be highly mobile under these environmentally relevant conditions, with little or no deposition. close 445...|$|R

50|$|The ink {{is created}} by placing an aqueous {{solution}} of silver nitrate into a flask of water combined with polyacrylic acid (PAA) and diethanolamine (DEA), the <b>capping</b> <b>agent</b> and reducing agent, respectively. After about twenty hours, the silver nitrate is dissolved, forming particles with a diameter of about 5 nanometers. In order to enlarge {{the size of the}} particle to an average diameter of about 400 nanometers, the flask is placed on a heated sonicator, a device that produces high-intensity ultrasound. Once cooled, the solution is poured into a larger flask and the thick precipitate, an insoluble solid, that is formed is scraped out. From there, ethanol is added to coagulate the particles, or change the particles to a solid state. Most of the supernatant, the liquid lying above a layer of the precipitate, is then poured out so that the remaining liquid can be centrifuged, or separated. After the process of centrifugation, the particles are placed back in water and forced through a syringe filter to remove unnecessary particles in the solution. Next, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) is added as a binder and the entire mixtures is homogenized. The solvents are allowed to evaporate until the ink has a desired viscosity. or thickness.|$|E
50|$|The key {{aspect of}} {{competitive}} absorption involves two substrates that phase-separate due {{to one or}} more opposite physical or chemical properties. When these substrates are mixed with a nanoparticle, typically gold, they maintain their separation and form two faces.A good example of this technique has been demonstrated by Vilain et al., where phosphinine-coated gold nanoparticles were exposed to long-chain thiols, resulting in substitution of the phosphinine ligands in a phase-separated manner to produce Janus nanoparticles. Phase separation was proven by showing the thiols formed one locally pure domain on the nanoparticle using FT-IR.Jakobs et al. demonstrated a major issue with the competitive adsorption method when they attempted to synthesize amphiphilic gold Janus nanoparticles using the competitive adsorption of hydrophobic and hydrophilic thiols. The synthesis demonstrated was quite simple and only involved two steps. First gold nanoparticles capped with tetra-n-octylammonium bromide were produced. Then the <b>capping</b> <b>agent</b> was removed followed by the addition of various ratios of hydrophilic disulfide functionalized ethylene oxide and hydrophobic disulfide functionalized oligo(p-phenylenevinylene). They then attempted to prove that phase separation on the particle surface occurred by comparing the contact angles of water on the surface of a monolayer of the Janus particles with nanoparticles made with only the hydrophobic or hydrophobic ligands. Instead the results of this experiment showed that while there was some phase separation, it was not complete. This result highlights that the ligand choice is extremely important and any changes may result in incomplete phase separation.|$|E
40|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} and electrochemistry {{were employed}} to examine <b>capping</b> <b>agent</b> dynamics in silver nanoparticles capped with DNA intercalated with ethidium bromide, a fluorescent molecule. The capped NPs were studied first electrochemically, demonstrating that the intercalation of the <b>capping</b> <b>agent</b> promotes oxidation of the silver core, occurring at 0. 50 V (vs Ag, compared with 1. 15 V for Ag NPs capped in DNA alone). Second, fluorescence electrochemical microscopy revealed that the electron transfer from the nanoparticles is gated by the <b>capping</b> <b>agent,</b> allowing dynamic insights unobservable using electrochemistry alone...|$|E
