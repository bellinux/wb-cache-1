40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> {{parenting}}. By drawing on the discourses of <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> parenting beliefs and practices, it provides an analysis of the childrearing stories told by Amy Chua (2011), an American Chinese mother. Chua shared in her book ‘Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother’ how she created excellence for her daughters through the use of Chinese parenting approaches. Chua’s ‘tiger mother’ practice, with its emphasis on parenting control, unyielding imposition of parenting rules, and strong focus on children’s success, captured my interest. In the context of her <b>immigrant</b> background and <b>Chinese</b> ethnicity, one would suppose that the ‘tiger mother’ book presented a standard account of <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> parenting. Through reviewing relevant literature, and portraying an example of New Zealand <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents’ beliefs and practices, this paper sketches some general patterns of <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> parenting. I argue that Chua’s approach embodies traditions and ideologies of Chinese culture, but is not a typical example...|$|R

5|$|Chinese {{immigration}} to the United States {{at that time was}} neither uniform nor widespread. J. R. Tucker, writing for The North American Review in 1884, stated {{that the vast majority of}} the nearly 100,000 <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrants</b> resided within the American West: California, Nevada, Oregon, and the Washington Territory. The U.S. Minister to China, George Seward, had asserted similar numbers in Scribner's Magazine five years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Sherman paid greater {{attention}} to foreign affairs {{during the second half}} of his Senate career, serving as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. In 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing unrestricted immigration from China. After the Panic of 1873, <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrants</b> were blamed for depressing wages; in reaction, Congress in 1879 passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, but Hayes vetoed it. Now, three years later, after China had agreed to treaty revisions, Congress tried again to exclude Chinese immigrants: Senator John F. Miller of California introduced another Exclusion Act that denied <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrants</b> United States citizenship and banned their immigration for a twenty-year period. Sherman opposed both the 1880 treaty revisions and the bill Miller proposed, believing that the Exclusion Act reversed the United States' traditional welcoming of all people and the country's dependence on foreign immigration for growth. President Arthur vetoed the bill, and Sherman voted to sustain the veto. A new Exclusion Act passed to conform to Arthur's objections. Sherman voted against this bill, too, but it passed, and Arthur signed it into law. In 1885, Sherman voted in favor of the Alien Contract Labor Law, which barred engaging in a labor contract before immigrating or transporting a person under such a contract to the United States. Sherman saw this Act as a more appropriate solution to depressed wages than Chinese exclusion: the problem, as he saw it, was not the national origin of <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrants,</b> but their employment under serf-like conditions.|$|E
5|$|Tension between {{whites and}} <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrants</b> {{in the late}} 19th century American West was {{particularly}} high, especially in the decade preceding the violence. The massacre in Rock Springs was the violent outburst of years of anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act suspended Chinese immigration for ten years, but not before thousands of immigrants came to the American West. Most <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrants</b> to Wyoming Territory took jobs with the railroad at first, but many ended up employed in coal mines owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. As Chinese immigration increased, so did anti-Chinese sentiment from whites. The Knights of Labor, {{one of the foremost}} voices against Chinese immigrant labor, formed a chapter in Rock Springs in 1883, and most rioters were members of that organization. However, no direct connection was ever established linking the riot to the national Knights of Labor organization.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{substantive}} grounded theory describing how <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs who own and operate small retail businesses in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa identify opportunities in the business environment. The substantive grounded theory was developed using the prescripts of grounded theory proposed by Strauss and Corbin (1990). In this respect, a substantive grounded theory called differentiating engagement of opportunity identification was developed from a sample of 41 qualitative interviews conducted with <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs. The study found that <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs identified various opportunities (startup, sales, operational, relational) in the business environment through their dynamic interactions and relationships with different stakeholders. These stakeholders mainly included family members, local employees and customers. The <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs displayed two interactional processes in their interactions with stakeholders, namely engaging in and disengaging from interactions. These interactional processes enabled the <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs to identify opportunities and operate their small businesses in the business environment. Assumptions held about the interactions and relationships with stakeholders in the host community were central to the interactional processes displayed by the <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs. As they operated their small businesses, the <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs would engage in interactions with customers who were perceived as favourable (approachable). From these interactions with favourable (approachable) customers, the <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs were able to identify opportunities (gaining customer insight of opportunity), whereas they would disengage from interactions with customers perceived as unfavourable (unapproachable). In this respect, they would delegate their local employees (actions of delegation in business) with the responsibility of interacting with unfavourable and hostile customers. Additionally, the <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs would engage in interactions with local employees to gain insight into local indigenous products and identify opportunities in the host community. In order to identify other opportunities (operational, relational), the <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs would disengage from interactions with local employees and engage in interactions with other stakeholders such as family members. The varying differentiated interactions and relationships established by the <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> entrepreneurs with different stakeholders created a relational context which enabled the identification of opportunities in the host environment. Thus, the findings of the present study and the substantive grounded theory developed (differentiating engagement of opportunity identification) are discussed from the perspective of social capital, social exchange theory and Chinese cultural values. Finally, the theory developed in the present study contributes to the understanding of the processes of how social capital and relationships contribute to the process of identifying opportunities and operating a small business by immigrant entrepreneurs within a host environment...|$|R

5|$|Outside of the Western hemisphere, Hayes's biggest {{foreign policy}} concern dealt with China. In 1868, the Senate had {{ratified}} the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrants</b> into the country. As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrants</b> were blamed for depressing workmen's wages. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, anti-Chinese riots {{broke out in}} San Francisco, and a third party, the Workingman's Party, was formed {{with an emphasis on}} stopping Chinese immigration. In response, Congress passed a Chinese Exclusion Act in 1879, abrogating the 1868 treaty. Hayes vetoed the bill, believing that the United States should not abrogate treaties without negotiation. The veto drew praise among eastern liberals, but Hayes was bitterly denounced in the West. In the subsequent furor, Democrats in the House of Representatives attempted to impeach him, but narrowly failed when Republicans prevented a quorum by refusing to vote. After the veto, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward suggested that both countries work together to reduce immigration, and he and James Burrill Angell negotiated with the Chinese to do so. Congress passed a new law to that effect, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, after Hayes left office.|$|E

Results showed that <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents had {{a lower level of}} involvement than non-Chinese parents across three forms of involvement including communication with teachers, volunteering to help at the preschool, and participation in the preschool's decision making. For the entire sample, parental role construction and parenting self-efficacy were predictors of all three forms of involvement, and perceived opportunity for involvement was predictor of communication with teachers. For the <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> sample, perceived opportunity for involvement predicted communication with teachers and participation in the preschool's decision making, and educational qualification predicted communication with teachers. The findings highlight the role of parents' motivational beliefs in parental involvement, in particular, the importance of teacher invitations for parental involvement among <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents...|$|R

5|$|Sarawak is {{the only}} state in Malaysia where Christians outnumber Muslims. The {{earliest}} Christian missionaries in Sarawak were Church of England (Anglicans) in 1848, followed by Roman Catholics a few years later, and Methodists in 1903.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{integration}} process {{of a small}} sample of <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> children in Quebec's public elementary schools. Specifically, it concentrates on the socio-cultural context of Quebec, and compares it with the Chinese home culture.

The findings of the study show that <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> children are experienced in facing a dual culture in their immigrant life. As China becomes the biggest immigrant resource country for Canada and Quebec, <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> children are changing the composition of the Quebec classroom. The study also indicates that some teachers and educators are not very familiar with the Chinese culture, and tend to view the Chinese learner in a stereotypical way as 'inevitably destined for academic success'.

50|$|While New Zealand {{teachers}} and parents generally choose a lenient approach for children’s learning, literature shows a contrary belief and practice among <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents in New Zealand show that they place much more value on children's academics than focusing on the playful aspects. <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents {{on the other hand}} see homework as a catapult for higher education as well as to prepare their children to pursue greater academic achievement. Chinese parents continue to uphold their Chinese Confucian cultural values and pursue academic learning for their children, while Western parents and teachers tend to follow a play and child-centered techniques. The findings show that different or even contradictory expectations and practices exist among <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents. <b>Chinese</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents see education and schoolwork as the preparation, revision, and extension of children’s knowledge. Learning is revered in Chinese culture. It reinforces the child's overall cognitive development during their early childhood years. Thus a sense of family obligation acts as children’s extrinsic motivation to perform well academically.|$|R
