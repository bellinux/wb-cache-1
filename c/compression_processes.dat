In this process, the sheet metal is worked into a drawn cup by the deep drawing process and then deformed to the target shape by compressing the cup edge.

The tool pressure and surface expansion ratio in the two-stage <b>compression</b> <b>process</b> are more favorable {{than those in the}} one-stage edge <b>compression</b> <b>process.</b> A series of two-stage compression experiments are carried out by using a steel sheet for deep-drawing.

The district court decided that the claim did not lead to a seamless DWT because the word [...] "seamless" [...] did not appear in it. The circuit court agreed with LizardTech that claim 21 was in fact directed to creating a seamless DWT, but nevertheless decided that claim 21 was invalid. The circuit court argued that claim 21, since it lacked the limitations of claim 1, would need [...] "to cover all ways of performing DWT-based <b>compression</b> <b>processes</b> that lead to a seamless DWT". The circuit court looked to the [...] "written description" [...] requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112, holding that the '835 patent did not properly describe any method other than [...] "maintaining updated sums".

To accurately estimate the straightening effect of the rolled piece, the Bauschinger effect {{must be considered in}} calculating the reduction rate.

The Bauschinger effect model is discussed in the elastic loading region and elastic plastic loading region.
