The Tropical Blue uniform may be worn year-round for general office wear and for visits between commands.

25|$|Harvey's meals {{were served}} in sumptuous {{portions}} {{that provided a}} good value for the traveling public; for instance, pies were cut into fourths, rather than sixths, which was the industry standard at the time. The Harvey Company and AT established a series of signals that allowed the dining room staff {{to make the necessary}} preparations to feed an entire train in just thirty minutes. Harvey Houses served their meals on fine China and Irish linens. Fred Harvey, a fastidious innkeeper, set high standards for efficiency and cleanliness in his establishments, personally inspecting them as often as possible. It was said that nothing escaped his notice, and he was even known to completely overturn a poorly set table. Male customers were required to wear a <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> in many of Harvey's dining rooms. The Harvey Houses served many a meal to GIs traveling on troop trains during World War II.|$|E

According to Soldier, an Arikara scout, [...] "Custer took off his buckskin <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> <b>tied</b> it behind his saddle." [...] Further, Custer- whose hair was thinning- joined a similarly balding Lieutenant Varnum and [...] "had the clippers run over their heads" [...] before leaving Fort Lincoln.|$|R

2500|$|The Working Khaki uniform {{was worn}} by Officers and Chief Petty Officers, {{primarily}} aboard ship or in selected working areas at bases ashore. Originally {{it was simply}} the Service Dress Khaki uniform worn without the <b>coat</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie.</b> Similar to, but less formal than, the Service Khaki, it consisted of a short or long-sleeve khaki uniform shirt, with warfare insignia and badges (i.e. command pins, nametags, etc., but no ribbons) worn {{on the top of}} the left pocket, and pin-on metal rank devices located on the collar. It also came with a set of khaki trousers, a khaki belt with a gold belt buckle, a command or [...] "U.S. Navy" [...] ballcap (garrison cap optional), and black or brown low quarter shoes, black or brown boots, or black leather safety shoes. It was often referred to as the [...] "Wash Khaki" [...] uniform, because it was a 100% cotton uniform that could be laundered but required pressing, differentiating it from the Summer Khaki made of Certified Navy Twill (CNT) or a poly-wool blend that is considered acceptable for wear ashore and off base, but which requires dry-cleaning. At the beginning of January 2011, the working khakis were replaced by the Navy Working Uniform, although the Navy Junior ROTC still uses them.|$|E

A reporter remarked that he [...] "cultivated gentlemanliness as a fine art."

50|$|As a head coach, Patera was {{considered}} to be a stern disciplinarian with strict rules of conduct.
