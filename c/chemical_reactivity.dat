Thallium forms the stable + ion in aqueous solution: like the isoelectronic Hg(CH3)2 and 2+, it is linear. Trimethylthallium and triethylthallium are, like the corresponding gallium and indium compounds, flammable liquids with low melting points. Like indium, thallium cyclopentadienyl compounds contain thallium(I), in contrast to gallium(III).|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is useful}} in the {{manufacture}} of chemical equipment on account of its low <b>chemical</b> <b>reactivity,</b> high thermal conductivity, and being easily workable. Silver crucibles (alloyed with 0.15% nickel to avoid recrystallisation of the metal at red heat) are used for carrying out alkaline fusion. Copper and silver are also used when doing chemistry with fluorine. Equipment made to work at high temperatures is often silver-plated.

40|$|The human {{complement}} components C 4 A and C 4 B {{are highly}} homologous proteins, but they show markedly different, class-specific, <b>chemical</b> <b>reactivities.</b> They also differ serologically in that C 4 A generally expresses the Rodgers (Rg) blood group antigens while C 4 B generally expresses the Chido (Ch) blood group antigens. C 4 A 1 and C 4 B 5 are exceptional variants which possess their class-specific <b>chemical</b> <b>reactivities,</b> but express essentially the reversed antigenicities. The genes encoding the typical Rg-positive C 4 A 3 a and Ch-positive C 4 B 3 allotypes and the interesting variants C 4 A 1 and C 4 B 5 have been cloned. Characterization of the cloned DNA {{has revealed that}} the genes encoding the A 3 a, A 1 and B 3 allotypes are 22 kb long, but that encoding B 5 is only 16 kb long. Comparison of derived amino acid sequences of the polymorphic C 4 d fragment has shown that C 4 A and C 4 B can be defined by only four isotypic amino acid differences at position 1101 - 1106. Over this region C 4 A has the sequence PCPVLD while C 4 B has the sequence LSPVIH, and this presumably {{is the cause of}} their different <b>chemical</b> <b>reactivities.</b> Moreover, the probable locations of the two Rg and the six Ch antigenic determinants have been deduced.

5|$|Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is {{the most}} widely used polymorph. It is a good {{lubricant}} at both low and high temperatures (up to 900°C, even in an oxidizing atmosphere). h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or <b>chemical</b> <b>reactivity</b> of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in cosmetics, paints, dental cements, and pencil leads.|$|E
5|$|Most {{proteins}} {{consist of}} linear polymers built from series {{of up to}} 20 different L-α-amino acids. All proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features, including an α-carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a variable side chain are bonded. Only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO–NH amide moiety into a fixed conformation. The side chains of the standard amino acids, detailed {{in the list of}} standard amino acids, have a great variety of chemical structures and properties; it is the combined effect of all of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three-dimensional structure and its <b>chemical</b> <b>reactivity.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{noble gas}} atoms, like atoms in most groups, {{increase}} steadily in atomic radius from one period {{to the next}} due to {{the increasing number of}} electrons. The size of the atom is related to several properties. For example, the ionization potential decreases with an increasing radius because the valence electrons in the larger noble gases are farther away from the nucleus and are therefore not held as tightly together by the atom. Noble gases have the largest ionization potential among the elements of each period, which reflects the stability of their electron configuration and is related to their relative lack of <b>chemical</b> <b>reactivity.</b> Some of the heavier noble gases, however, have ionization potentials small enough to be comparable to those of other elements and molecules. It was the insight that xenon has an ionization potential {{similar to that of the}} oxygen molecule that led Bartlett to attempt oxidizing xenon using platinum hexafluoride, an oxidizing agent known to be strong enough to react with oxygen. Noble gases cannot accept an electron to form stable anions; that is, they have a negative electron affinity.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, initial {{support to}} develop {{alternative}} fuels {{by the government}} was also {{a response to the}} first oil crisis, and some time later, as a goal to improve air quality. Also, liquid fuels were preferred over gaseous fuels not only because they have a better volumetric energy density but also because they were the most compatible fuels with existing distribution systems and engines, thus avoiding a big departure from the existing technologies and taking advantage of the vehicle and the refueling infrastructure. California led the search of sustainable alternatives with interest focused in methanol. Ford Motor Company and other automakers responded to California's request for vehicles that run on methanol. In 1981, Ford delivered 40 dedicated methanol fuel (M100) Escorts to Los Angeles County, but only four refueling stations were installed. The biggest challenge in the development of alcohol vehicle technology was getting all of the fuel system materials compatible with the higher <b>chemical</b> <b>reactivity</b> of the fuel. Methanol was even more of a challenge than ethanol but much of the early experience gained with neat ethanol vehicle production in Brazil was transferable to methanol. The success of this small experimental fleet of M100s led California to request more of these vehicles, mainly for government fleets. In 1983, Ford built 582 M100 vehicles; 501 went to California, and the remaining to New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E

Secondly, the stereo-conformation of transplatin is such that it is unable to form the characteristic 1,2-intrastand d(GpG) adducts formed by cisplatin in abundance.|$|E

They are less common in household use, with occasional exceptions such as ammonia and methanol. For instance, phosgene is a highly reactive nucleophile acceptor, which makes it an excellent reagent for polymerizing diols and diamines to produce polycarbonate and polyurethane plastics. For this use, millions of tons are produced annually. However, the same reactivity makes it also highly reactive towards proteins in human tissue and thus highly toxic.
