40|$|The chapter {{focuses on}} cross‐border {{cooperation}} programmes between the EU border regions and their immediate neighbours. The chapter includes first {{a reflection on}} the role {{and the meaning of}} cross‐border cooperation in its historical development: from its application to the EU internal borders to its transfer towards non‐EU countries and to the European neighbourhood. The aim is to reflect on the changing significance of political borders in a Post‐Westaphalian “Europe of regions” and on the symbolic and material construction of the EU’s external frontiers. Secondly, the chapter presents a critical analysis of the narratives and the strategies of the cross-border cooperation initiatives launched within the ENP, in order to identify differences and tensions among different programmes and meso‐regions. The discussion of its <b>cross‐border</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>component,</b> it is ar-gued, is particularly useful for understanding the contradictions which arise from the implementation of the ENP, the variety of governance models by which the policy is implemented and the relevance and the function that borders and border regions have in the construction of a “wider Europe”. Moreover, the issues of Eu-ropeanization and transnational governance, and the attempts to strengthen territo-rial cohesion between the EU member States and the non‐EU neighbouring coun-tries are discussed...|$|E

The aim of the article is to introduce factors that influence <b>cross-border</b> <b>cooperation</b> between businesses in the Alps–Adriatic region. A descriptive and analytical approach is used. On {{the basis of the}} results of empirical international research into <b>cross-border</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the Alps–Adriatic region between Carinthia, Friuli-Venezia Giulia (FVG) and Slovenia the article shows and analyses the barriers that businesses face in <b>cross-border</b> <b>cooperation</b> and the factors they consider to best stimulate <b>cross-border</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The results show that good personal relations, language skills and shared interests are the most important factors; the level of assistance and administrative/legislative barriers are the biggest barriers in <b>cross-border</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Different factors stimulating <b>cross-border</b> <b>cooperation</b> can be used to create a base for future strategies and training for business managers...|$|R
