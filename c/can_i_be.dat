500|$|The game's {{score is}} {{composed}} by Petri Alanko. The soundtrack features the song [...] "War" [...] by Poets of the Fall, from the band's fourth studio album, Twilight Theater. Sam Lake {{said that the}} song [...] "...is a prominent part of the Alan Wake soundtrack and the theme also links strongly to the game's storyline." [...] Poets of the Fall also perform two original songs, [...] "Children of the Elder God" [...] and [...] "The Poet and the Muse", under the name Old Gods of Asgard. The band wrote the ending theme to Remedy's previous game, , called [...] "Late Goodbye", {{which is based on}} a poem written by Lake. [...] "War", however, was not written specifically for Alan Wake. [...] "Haunted" [...] by Poe plays {{at the end of the}} second episode. [...] "Space Oddity" [...] by David Bowie plays over the end credits. Anomie Belle's [...] "How <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>Be</b> Sure" [...] is featured in the third episode.

500|$|From the outset, Dallas was {{centered}} around {{the lives of the}} wealthy Ewing family who lived in Dallas, Texas. Once the show became a success after the initial run as a five-episode miniseries, the producers decided to expand the roles of certain characters. They introduced the parents of [...] Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton), who had not been shown on-screen until that point. Actress Joan Van Ark was contacted by series creator David Jacobs about joining the show. Her husband, John Marshall, convinced her to take the opportunity. In an interview for an episode of Celebrity Weddings, Van Ark said: [...] "At the time Dallas came up, I was doing two different jobs. They offered me to join Dallas, which would be shot in Dallas, Texas at Southfork. I read the script and it was buzzed about already...they were saying this was the hot new show. I said to myself, 'How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> in Los Angeles doing this, down in Dallas, and then back in New York doing two days worth of Estée Lauder commercials?' He (my husband) read it and said, 'You've got to. It's a wonderful part. So, my husband talked me into a role that would become a fifteen-year chapter in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Carry Out" [...] is one {{of twelve}} songs written and {{produced}} by Timbaland and J-Roc for Timbaland's third studio album Shock Value II (2009). Justin Timberlake, Attitude and Jim Beanz, notable collaborators with Timbaland, also assisted {{in the writing of}} the song. Timbaland, in an interview with MTV's Shaheem Reed and Gil Kaufman, stated that he favored this song over other recordings because the process for creating the song was similar to those of other collaborations they have done. Timberlake would come into the studio and listen to the track. Afterwards, he would then compose the lyrics in his head. Upon explaining their method of making music, Timbaland stated that: [...] "We got a chemistry that cannot be described. People ask, 'Well, what are you and Justin like?' Can't tell you what it's like — it's a chemistry that can't be described. Something you would have to see for yourself and be, like, 'Them two got magic'." [...] Timbaland stated that the song resembles a [...] "2010 version" [...] of Snoop Dogg's [...] "Drop It Like It's Hot", produced by The Neptunes. He also revealed that the intention of the song was to provide a different slang for women: [...] "Instead of 'Your phat butt' or 'Your big breasts,' we say, 'Oh, I need you. <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> your carry out? Be my carry out. I want you to be my dinner, my leftovers, my everything.' It's a different slang. We're grown men, I wanna be subliminal to females. Like, 'Oooh, carry out? That's kinda sexy'." ...|$|E

[...] As the Rolling Stone article further explained, Tricky created [...] "a mercurial style of dance music that immediately finds [...] own fast feet." ...|$|E

Despite being in a similar situation as regards funding, Cinematic benefited from much better, integrated production as well as punchy tracks such as [...] "Bright White Light".

[...] Mahathir established the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission to investigate the activities of the United States, Israel and its allies in Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. He has also suggested that the September 11 attacks of 2001 might have been staged by the United States government.|$|E
2500|$|Badges {{bearing the}} {{portrait}} of Kim Jong-il appeared in 1982, and many started to wear one alongside their Kim Il-sung badges. The first badge containing both Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il appeared in the 1980s, but {{is different from the}} present double badge reserved for security services cadres. Kim Jong-il badges were discontinued in the 1990s following his alleged remark: [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> presented on the same level as our sole 'sun', Kim Il Sung?". In 1992, in time for Kim Jong-il's 50th birthday, a pin with his face only reappeared. It, too, was unpopular due to his known reluctance to be elevated to the level of his father. Kim Jong-il badges began to be worn more widely only around the year 2000, with a renewed design, and badges featuring both Kims only recently.|$|E

2500|$|Venice {{had changed}} for him. Casanova now had little money for gambling, few willing females worth pursuing, and few acquaintances to enliven his dull days. He {{heard of the}} death of his mother and, more paining, visited the deathbed of Bettina Gozzi, who had first {{introduced}} him to sex and who died in his arms. His Iliad was published in three volumes, but to limited subscribers and yielding little money. He got into a published dispute with Voltaire over religion. When he asked, [...] "Suppose that you succeed in destroying superstition. With what will you replace it?" [...] Voltaire shot back, [...] "I like that. When I deliver humanity from a ferocious beast which devours it, <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> asked what I shall put in its place." [...] From Casanova's point of view, if Voltaire had [...] "been a proper philosopher, he would have kept silent on that subject ... the people need to live in ignorance for the general peace of the nation".|$|E

[...] After reading the letter, Zhong Hui was shocked and he told his close aides, [...] "When His Excellency ordered me to arrest Deng Ai, he knew I was capable of accomplishing the task alone. However, now, since he has brought his troops here, he must be suspecting me. We should take action quickly. If we succeed, the Empire is ours.

[...] He denies being anti-establishment though, [...] "I wrote a sitcom for the BBC when I was 21! [...] How the fuck <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> anti-establishment? From the first interview I ever did, I talked about Morecambe and Wise, and every time {{they wanted me to}} talk about Lenny Bruce I'd say, 'Yeah, he's fine, but he doesn't make me laugh the way Eric 'n' Ernie do."

2500|$|Wittgenstein {{was quite}} vocal about his {{depression}} in his years at Cambridge, {{and before he}} went to war; on many an occasion, he told Russell of his woes. His mental anguish seemed to stem from two sources: his work, and his personal life. Wittgenstein made numerous remarks to Russell about logic driving him mad. Wittgenstein also stated to Russell that he [...] "felt the curse of those who have half a talent". He later expresses this same worry, and tells of being in mediocre spirits due to his lack of progress in his logical work. Monk writes that Wittgenstein lived and breathed logic, and a temporary lack of inspiration plunged him into despair. Unless he was lying, Wittgenstein tells of his work in logic affecting his mental status in a very extreme way. However, he also tells Russell another story. Around Christmas, in 1913, he writes: [...] "how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> a logician before I'm a human being? For {{the most important thing is}} coming to terms with myself!" [...] He also tells Russell on an occasion in Russell’s rooms that he was worried about logic and his sins; also, once upon arrival to Russell's rooms one night Wittgenstein announced to Russell that he would kill himself once he left. Of things Wittgenstein personally told Russell, Ludwig’s temperament was also recorded in the diary of David Pinsent. Pinsent writes [...] "I have to be frightfully careful and tolerant when he gets these sulky fits", and [...] "I am afraid he is in an even more sensitive neurotic state just now than usual", when talking about Wittgenstein's emotional fluctuations.|$|E
2500|$|In other words, the 'limit' on what omnipotence 'can' {{do is not}} a {{limit on}} its actual agency, but an {{epistemological}} boundary without which omnipotence could not be identified (paradoxically or otherwise) in the first place. In fact, this process is merely a fancier form of the classic Liar Paradox: If I say, [...] "I am a liar", then {{how can it be}} true if I am telling the truth therewith, and, if I am telling the truth therewith, then how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> a liar? So, to think that omnipotence is an epistemological paradox is like failing to recognize that, when taking the statement, 'I am a liar' self-referentially, the statement is reduced to an actual failure to lie. In other words, if one maintains the supposedly 'initial' position that the necessary conception of omnipotence includes the 'power' to compromise both itself and all other identity, and if one concludes from this position that omnipotence is epistemologically incoherent, then one implicitly is asserting that one's own 'initial' position is incoherent. Therefore, the question (and therefore the perceived paradox) is meaningless. [...] Nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning with the addition of the two words, [...] "God can" [...] before it. Lewis additionally said that, [...] "Unless something is self-evident, nothing can be proved." [...] This implies for the debate on omnipotence that, as in matter, so in the human understanding of truth: it takes no true insight to destroy a perfectly integrated structure, and the effort to destroy has greater effect than an equal effort to build; so, a man is thought a fool who assumes its integrity, and thought an abomination who argues for it. It is easier to teach a fish to swim in outer space than to convince a room full of ignorant fools why it cannot be done.|$|E
