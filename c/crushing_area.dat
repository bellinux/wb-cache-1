40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{aims and}} {{objectives}}: The aims {{and objectives of}} this study were to characterize and compare the airborne particulate matter in the tankhouse and <b>crusher</b> <b>areas</b> of a base metal refinery sampled with two separate methods, in terms of mass concentration, nickel content, and particle size distribution. Methods: Area sampling was conducted in the two areas. Two methods were applied to collect particulate samples. The first is a multi–stage virtual impactor, the Respicon, which was used to determine the three critical particle fractions (inhalable, thoracic and respirable). The NIOSH 7300 method determined the particle concentration and nickel percentage present in each fraction. Using formulas provided by the manufacturers two additional particle–size fractions (extra–thoracic and trachea–bronchial) could be calculated. The second was based on the standard NIOSH 0500 method, which determined particle size distribution depicted as cumulative percentages. The samples were analyzed using laser scattering instrumentation. Results: In the tankhouse the highest level of exposure was to particles bigger than 10 um, with the highest nickel percentage also falling into this range. However, high nickel percentages were present in all three cut–off sizes (4 um, 10 um and > 10 um). The particle concentration for the <b>crusher</b> <b>area</b> was the highest for particulates bigger than 10 um, with the highest nickel percentage present in this fraction. After comparing the tankhouse and <b>crusher</b> <b>areas,</b> {{it is clear that the}} particle concentration is much higher in the <b>crusher</b> <b>area</b> according to all sampling methods used. The nickel content present in the analysis of these areas is of great concern. Conclusion: With the knowledge obtained through this research one hopes to establish a basis for particle size sampling in the platinum mining industry. This may lead to the development of health based OEL's and reflect a more accurate evaluation of workers particulate exposure. This information will give a greater understanding of health risks workers are exposed to. Master...|$|R

The first documented discovery of gold took place by Burrell Brewer in 1828. Brewer Gold Company, a subsidiary owned by the British Costain Limited Group (Costain), secured ownership of the mine in 1986, with the first gold production occurring in August 1987. Ore was mined using conventional open pit methods until January 1995. Rock was first fractured using drilling and blasting, and then loaded into trucks. Waste rock was used as fill for facility construction or hauled to a disposal area {{to the south of}} the Brewer Pit. Ore was hauled to the <b>crushing</b> <b>area</b> where processing for the cyanide heap-leach method began. The crushed ore was then placed on pads and a dilute cyanide solution was sprayed over the heaps and allowed to percolate through the ore, thereby dissolving the gold into solution.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} {{variation}} of the pressure relief scope and the stress around hydraulic flushing borehole, the theory of coal-rock damage was utilized to distinguish the interaction area of water-jet and coal-rock into the coal-rock <b>crushing</b> <b>area,</b> the water-jet pressure stagnation area, the transition area and the original stress recovery area of coal-rock. Based on the actual occurrence conditions of the coal seam, the pressure variation and relief scope around the hydraulic flushing borehole were analyzed and simulated by RFPA 2 D-Flow software. The results showed that a relief area with the radius of 5. 0 ~ 6. 0 m around the borehole formed due to the hydraulic flushing with the pressure relief of 0. 038 ~ 6. 545 MPa, and the maximum principal stress is 15. 85 MPa with a distance of 6. 8 m from the inspected hole where stress concentration appeared.

Qualitative studies have described increased expression of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and N-cadherin in models of nerve injury allowing active regeneration. In this study we have used quantitative immunohistochemistry to compare expression of NCAM and N-cadherin after nerve injury either with active regeneration (crush) into the distal stump or without (axotomy and capping). Quantification was performed 15 days after axotomy in proximal and distal stumps. Quantification after crush either proximal, distal or within the <b>crushed</b> <b>area</b> was performed at 2, 7, 15 and 30 days after injury. Axotomy induced increases in expression in proximal stumps between two and three times those in uninjured nerves for both molecules. In distal stumps, N-cadherin levels increased seven-fold, yet NCAM levels did not exceed control values. After crush, NCAM immunoreactivity increased in the <b>crushed</b> <b>area</b> and distal stump in contrast to axotomy and NCAM-positive axons co-localized with PGP 9. 5. N-cadherin levels in the distal stump increased above control levels, but {{the magnitude of the}} increase seen after crush was different to those seen after axotomy.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of Ga-As (904 nm) laser on the crushed nerve region compared with laser of the corresponding spinal cord segments. Material and Materials and Methods :Thirty Albino Wistar male rats weighing 180 - 240 g were used in this study. The sciatic nerve was crushed at the middle level with an aneurysm clip (Aesculap FE 751; Tuttingen, Germany) for 4 minutes. The rats were allocated into three groups. In group 1, laser irradiation was applied at the four points along the corresponding spinal cord segments (L 3 -L 6) in contact with the shaved skin. In group 2, the <b>crushed</b> <b>area</b> in contact with the shaved skin was irradiated. In group 3, the same procedure was performed without emission. The first laser treatment was performed on the second day of surgery and was&nbsp; repeated once daily for 21 consecutive days. The measured electrophysiological parameters included compound muscle action potential (CMAP), distal motor latency (DML), and motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Measurements were taken just before crushing and were repeated on the 21 st day of the treatment and the 42 nd day of the follow-up period. Sciatic Functional Index (SFI) and Toe Spread Analysis (TSA) were carried out on postoperative days 2, 7, 14, 21 and 42. Results: There was no significant difference between groups regarding DML and amplitude of CMAP. The NCV was significantly faster in group 1 on the 21 st and 42 nd days than in the other groups. The differences between groups regarding SFI and TSA on the 1 st, 7 th, 14 th, 21 st, and 42 nd days were insignificant (p&gt; 0. 05).

The monitoring periods were 14 October- 14 November 1992, 20 October- 15 November 1993, 16 August- 3 November 1994, and 17 February- 27 February 1995. Pairs of high volume air samplers were located at each of four locations of the process stream: the "spoils pile" that was the feedstock, the "plant area" near the hot soil gate of the sorter, the "clean pile" conveyer area where sorted clean soil was moved, and the "oversize soil" <b>crushing</b> <b>area.</b> These locations were monitored only during the working hours, while air monitoring was also done at an upwind, "background" area 24 -hours per day. The median concentrations of Pu in "workplace" air (combined spoils pile, plant area, and clean pile sites) in 1992 was 397 aCi/m{sup 3 } (15 {mu}Bq/m{sup 3 }), but increased to median values of 23000 aCi/m{sup 3 } (852 {mu}Bq/m{sup 3 }) in August-November 1994 and 29800 aCi/m{sup 3 } (1100 {mu}Bq/m{sup 3 }) in February 1995.

40|$|The {{present study}} was done to assess cement dust {{exposure}} {{and its relationship to}} respiratory health effects, both acute and chronic respiratory symptoms and ventilatory function impairment among Portland cement factory workers in Khash located in the south part of Iran. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Khash Portland cement producing factory in Iran in 2001. A total of 170 exposed and 170 unexposed employees were selected. Air transmitted personal respirable dust and total dust samples were collected in a full-time (8 h/day) shift. Dust level was determined by the gravimetric method. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect information and history of respiratory health among workers (exposed and unexposed to dust) and measurements of lung function were made using a spirometer in both groups. Concentrations of personal respirable dust ranged from 3. 7 mg/m 3 in the kilns to 23 mg/m 3 in the ore <b>crushing</b> <b>area,</b> and total dust ranged from 15 mg/m 3 in the kilns to 95 mg/m 3. Cough and phlegm, with or without shortness of breath, were significantly related to dust concentration. Measuring pulmonary functions of workers exposed to dust and unexposed group showed a significant decrease in vital capacity, forced vital capacity, FEF 25 - 75 and Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (P< 0. 05). Findings suggest that occupational exposure to Portland cement dust may lead to higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and the reduction of ventilator capacity due to existence of quartz in row material of cement dusts. The study revealed that cement dust exposure is associated with acute as well as chronic respiratory health effects.

Damage to the surface morphology (e. g., <b>crushed</b> <b>areas</b> and scratches) and the corresponding superhydrophobicity are shown to be rapidly healed through a simple heat treatment at 60 °C for 20 min. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) were used to study the anti-corrosion performance of the scratched and the healed superhydrophobic coatings immersed in a 3. 5 wt% NaCl solution. The results revealed that the anti-corrosion performance of the scratched coatings was improved upon the incorporation of BTA. After the heat treatment, the scratched superhydrophobic coatings exhibited excellent recovery of their anti-corrosion performance, which is attributed to {{the closure of the}} scratch by the shape memory effect and to the improved inhibition efficiency of BTA. Furthermore, we found that the pre-existing corrosion product inside the coating scratch could hinder the scratch closure by the shape memory effect and reduce the coating adhesion in the scratched region. However, the addition of BTA effectively suppressed the formation of corrosion products and enhanced the self-healing and adhesion performance under these conditions. Importantly, we also demonstrated that these coatings can be autonomously healed within 1 h in an outdoor environment using sunlight as the heat source. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{mammalian}} {{central nervous}} system (CNS) is unable to regenerate. In contrast, the CNS of fish, including the visual system, is able to regenerate after damage. Moreover, the fish visual system grows continuously throughout {{the life of the}} animal, and it is therefore an excellent model to analyze processes of myelination and re-myelination after an injury. Here we analyze Sox 10 + oligodendrocytes in the goldfish retina and optic nerve in controls and after two kinds of injuries: cryolesion of the peripheral growing zone and crushing of the optic nerve. We also analyze changes in a major component of myelin, myelin basic protein (MBP), as a marker for myelinated axons. Our results show that Sox 10 + oligodendrocytes are located in the retinal nerve fiber layer and along the whole length of the optic nerve. MBP was found to occupy a similar location, although its loose appearance in the retina differed from the highly organized MBP+ axon bundles in the optic nerve. After optic nerve crushing, the number of Sox 10 + cells decreased in the <b>crushed</b> <b>area</b> and in the optic nerve head. Consistent with this, myelination was highly reduced in both areas. In contrast, after cryolesion we did not find changes in the Sox 10 + population, although we did detect some MBP- degenerating areas.

40|$|Usually, {{phosphate}} deposits contain 238 U and 232 Th {{in addition}} to their decay products. Due to their different pathways in the environment, the 238 U/ 232 Th activity concentration ratio usually found to be greater than unity in phosphate sediments. The presence of these radionuclides creates a potential need to control exposure of workers in the mining and processing activities of the phosphate minerals in accordance with IAEA safety standards. The greatest dose to workers comes from exposure to radon, especially 222 Rn from the uranium series, and has to be controlled. In this regard, radon (222 Rn) was measured in the atmosphere (indoor and outdoor) of Al-Jalamid phosphate-mines working area using a portable radon-measurement instrument RAD 7, in a purpose of radiation protection. Radon was measured in 61 sites inside the open phosphate mines, the phosphate upgrading facility (offices and rooms of the workers, and in some open-air sites) and in the dwellings of the workers residence-village that lies at about 3 km from the mines working area. The obtained results indicated that the average indoor radon concentration was about 48. 4 Bq/m 3. Inside the upgrading facility, the average outdoor concentrations were 10. 8 and 9. 7 Bq/m 3 in the concentrate piles and <b>crushing</b> <b>areas,</b> respectively. It was 12. 3 Bq/m 3 in the atmosphere of the open mines. These values are comparable with the global average values. Based on the average values, the annual effective dose due to radon inhalation was calculated and risk estimates have been done. The average annual effective dose to workers due to the radon inhalation was estimated by 1. 32 mSv. The potential excess risk of lung cancer mortality that could be attributed to radon, when considering the lifetime exposure, was estimated by 53. 0 x 10 - 4. The results have been discussed in detail...|$|R
