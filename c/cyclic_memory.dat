40|$|Chaotic {{dynamics}} {{introduced in}} a recurrent {{neural network model}} is applied to controlling an object to track a moving target in two-dimensional space, which is set as an ill-posed problem. The motion increments of the object are determined {{by a group of}} motion functions calculated in real time with firing states of the neurons in the network. Several <b>cyclic</b> <b>memory</b> attractors that correspond to several simple motions of the object in two-dimensional space are embedded. Chaotic dynamics introduced in the network causes corresponding complex motions of the object in two-dimensional space. Adaptively real-time switching of control parameter results in constrained chaos (chaotic itinerancy) in the state space of the network and enables the object to track a moving target along a certain trajectory successfully. The performance of tracking is evaluated by calculating the success rate over 100 trials with respect to nine kinds of trajectories along which the target moves respectively. Computer experiments show that chaotic dynamics is useful to track a moving target. To understand the relations between these cases and chaotic dynamics, dynamical structure of chaotic dynamics is investigated from dynamical viewpoint...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present and}} {{evaluate}} a new memory man-agement technique for eliminating memory leaks in programs with dynamic memory allocation. This technique observes {{the execution of}} the program on a sequence of training inputs to find m-bounded allocation sites, which have the property that at any time during {{the execution of the}} program, the program only accesses the last m objects allocated at that site. The technique then transforms the program to use <b>cyclic</b> <b>memory</b> allocation at that site: it preallocates a buffer containing m objects of the type allocated at that site, with each allocation returning the next object in the buffer. At the end of the buffer the allocations wrap back around to the first object. Cyclic allocation eliminates any memory leak at the allocation site — the total amount of memory required to hold all of the objects ever allocated at the site is simply m times the object size. We evaluate our technique by applying it to several widely-used open source programs. Our results show that it is able to successfully eliminate important memory leaks in these pro-grams. A potential concern is that the estimated bounds m may be too small, causing the program to overlay live objects in memory. Our results indicate that our bounds estimation technique is quite accurate in practice, providing incorrect results for only one of the 161 m-bounded sites that it identifies. To further evaluate the potential impact of overlaying live objects, we artificially reduce the bounds at other m-bounded sites and observe the resulting behavior. The general pattern that emerges is that overlaying elements of core data structures may make the program fail. Overlaying application data, however, may impair parts of the functionality but does not prevent the program from continuing to execute to correctly deliver the remaining functionality...|$|E
40|$|With {{increased}} {{complexity of}} the contemporary very large integrated circuits the need for onchip test addressing not only the digital but also analog and mixed-signal RF blocks has emerged. The standard production test has become more costly and the instrumentation is pushed to its limits by the {{leading edge integrated circuit}} technologies. Also the chip performance for high frequency operation and the area overhead appear a hindrance in terms of the test access points needed for the instrumentation-based test. To overcome these problems, test implemented on a chip can be used by sharing the available resources such as digital signal processing (DSP) and A/D, D/A converters to constitute a built-in-self-test. In this case, the DSP can serve both as a stimuli generator and response analyzer. Arbitrary test signals can be achieved using DSP. Specifically, the ΣΔ modulation technique implemented in software is useful to encode a single- or two-tone stimulus as a onebit sequence to generate a spectrally pure signal with a high dynamic range. The sequence can be stored in a <b>cyclic</b> <b>memory</b> on a chip and applied to the circuit under test using a buffer and a simple reconstruction filter. In this way ADC dynamic test for harmonic and intermodulation distortion is carried out in a simple setup. The FFT artifacts are avoided by careful frequency planning for low-pass and band-pass ΣΔ encoding technique. A noise shaping based on a combination of low- and band-pass ΣΔ modulation is also useful providing a high dynamic range for measurements at high frequencies that is a new approach. However, a possible asymmetry between rise and fall time due to CMOS process variations in the driving buffer results in nonlinear distortion and increased noise at low frequencies. A simple iterative predistortion technique is used to reduce the low frequency distortion components by making use of an on-chip DC calibrated ADC that is another contribution of the author. Some tests, however, like the two-tone RF test that targets linearity performance of a radio receiver, require test stimuli based on a dedicated hardware. For the measurement of the thirdor second-intercept point (IP 3 /IP 2) a spectrally clean stimulus is essential. Specifically, the second- or third-order harmonic or intermodulation products of the stimulus generator should be avoided as they can obscure the test measurement. A challenge in this design is the phase noise performance and spurious tones of the oscillators, and also the distortion-free addition of the two tones. The mutual pulling effect can be minimized by layout isolation techniques. A new two-tone RF generator based on a specialized phase-locked loop (PLL) architecture is presented as a viable solution for IP 3 /IP 2 on-chip test. The PLL provides control over the frequency spacing of two voltage controlled oscillators. For the two-tone stimulus a highly linear analog  adder is designed to limit distortion which could obscure the IP 3 test. A specialized feedback circuit in the PLL is proposed to overcome interference by the reference spurs. The circuit is designed using 65 nm CMOS process. By using a fine spectral resolution the observed noise floor can be reduced to enable the measurement of second- or third-order intermodulation product tones. This also reflects a tradeoff between the test time and the test performance. While the test time to collect the required number of samples can be of milliseconds the number of samples need not be excessive, since the measurements are carried out at the receiver baseband, where the required sampling frequency is relatively low...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{thermally}} reversible polyurethanes (PUs) with {{shape memory}} effect {{were developed by}} using hydrogen bonding to enhance physical interactions. Two different types of PUs were synthesized: (1) a linear PU whose hard segment consists of methylene di-para-phenyl isocyanate (MDI) and di(ethylene glycol) (DEG); its soft segment is made of Tone 0260 polyol, a polyester polyol; (2) a side-chain dendritic PU which replaces DEG with different generations of dendritic chain extenders. By incorporation of the dendritic structure with peripheral long alkyl chains (strong van der Waals forces), the miscibility between hard and soft segments can be significantly improved. Consequently, the hydrogen bonding reinforced hard segments (malonamide linkages) of side chain dendritic PUs result in greatly enhanced mechanical properties and shape <b>memory</b> effect.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new method, called cyclic abduction, for automatically inferring safety and/or termination preconditions for heap-manipulating while programs, expressed as inductive definitions in separation logic. Cyclic abduction essentially works by {{searching for a}} <b>cyclic</b> proof of <b>memory</b> safety and/or termination, abducing definitional clauses of the precondition as {{necessary in order to}} advance the proof search process.

40|$|In {{this study}} asymmetrically {{reinforced}} epoxy (EP) /carbon fibre (CF) fabric composites were prepared and their shape memory properties were quantified in both unconstrained and fully constrained flexural tests {{performed in a}} dynamic mechanical analyser (DMA).

The recovery stress was markedly increased with increasing CF content. The related stress was always higher when the CF-rich layer experienced tension load locally.
