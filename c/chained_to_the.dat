5|$|Atlas– A four-armed Titan who {{was imprisoned}} in Tartarus after the Great War. In Chains of Olympus, Atlas was freed by the goddess Persephone and {{captured}} the god Helios on her behalf. Persephone directed Atlas to use Helios' power {{to destroy the}} Pillar of the World. Atlas, however, was <b>chained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> weakened pillar by Kratos, and was doomed to carry {{the weight of the}} world on his shoulders forever. After Kratos defeated Persephone, Atlas mocked Kratos and his choice to defend the gods. In God of War II, Atlas and Kratos met again, and although he was initially bitter towards Kratos, Atlas decided to help him reach the Sisters of Fate, providing him with the magic, Atlas Quake, and stated that they would meet again. This would be Atlas' final appearance, however, leaving his fate unknown. The character was voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan in God of War II, and Fred Tatasciore in Chains of Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{enters the}} Desert of Lost Souls, and Athena tells him Pandora's Box is {{hidden in a}} temple <b>chained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of the Titan Cronos—a {{punishment}} by Zeus for Cronos' role in the Great War. Kratos summons Cronos, climbs for three days before reaching the Temple entrance, overcomes an array of deadly traps and an army of monsters, and eventually finds the Box. But Ares, aware of his former servant's success, kills Kratos as the latter is leaving the Temple. While harpies take the Box to Ares, Kratos falls into the Underworld. He battles {{his way through the}} fiery realm, and with help from the mysterious gravedigger, who tells him Athena is not the only god watching over him, he escapes and returns to Athens.|$|E
5|$|The Aegean Sea setting {{includes}} {{a mass of}} shipwrecked vessels. Athens is a war-torn city under assault by Ares, the God of War; beyond the city is the Desert of Lost Souls, a vast and windy desert of ancient ruins. The majority of the game occurs in Pandora’s Temple, which is <b>chained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of the Titan Cronos, who crawls through the desert. The massive temple, constructed by the architect Pathos Verdes III, is filled with traps and monsters, and has three sections dedicated to the Titan Atlas and gods Poseidon and Hades, respectively. The Underworld is a fiery realm with spiked pillars full of souls and flaming versions of previously encountered enemies. Athens is {{the scene of the}} final battle before a denouement on Mount Olympus in the God of War's throne room.|$|E

50|$|The {{second most}} popular solution, due to not {{requiring}} tandem-specific cranks is called single side rear drive. The forward crankset is {{connected by a}} right-side timing <b>chain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear crankset, {{which in turn is}} connected by a right-side <b>chain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear wheel.

5|$|The prison {{reformer}} John Howard travelled {{around the}} country in the 1770s inspecting jails, and presented his research in The State of the Prisons in England and Wales (1777). In a jail owned by the Bishop of Ely, Howard wrote, prisoners had ten years earlier been kept <b>chained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor on their backs, with spiked collars round their necks and iron bars over their legs. The Duke of Portland had a one-room cellar in Chesterfield that housed four prisoners, with no straw or heat, which had not been cleaned for months. Lord Arundel owned a jail in Penzance, where Howard found a debtor in a room 11ftx11ft and 6ft high, with a small window. The door of the room had not been opened for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|In a {{flashback}} scene, Nico explores an old facility in Phoenix, {{where she is}} confronted by Spallaci's men, but is saved by Maynard. However, Maynard dies after he gets locked in the centrifuge, and Nico manages to escape by tricking Spallaci's men. Back in Rome, Nico informs George that the monatomic gold {{is being used to}} build a weapon called the Ark. They return to the monastery and witness Father Gregor shoot Gianelli; Nico is taken away and George is knocked out. When he awakens, the dying Gianelli hands over a manuscript in Latin, and tells him that the Ark's purpose is to use the monatomic gold to destroy the unbelievers. George goes to rescue Nico and meets Anna Maria in the catacombs, who tells him her side of the story and that the Ark needs a human interface to be activated. George arrives at the ceremony to see Nico <b>chained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ark, ready to become the new Angel of Death. Mevlut, who is in fact ex-Turkish security and only pretended to be a waiter and priest, enters the scene armed with a gun, but Anna Maria points her gun at him as well. George succeeds in stopping the ceremony in time and frees Nico, but Anna Maria and Mevlut shoot each other and die.|$|E

25|$|The OLPC {{program has}} its roots in the {{pedagogy}} of Seymour Papert, an approach known as constructionism, which espoused providing computers for children at early ages to enable full digital literacy. Papert, along with Nicholas Negroponte, were at the MIT Media Lab from its inception. Papert compared the old practice of putting computers in a computer lab to books <b>chained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> walls in old libraries. Negroponte likened shared computers to shared pencils. However, this pattern seemed to be inevitable, given the then-high prices of computers (over $1,500 apiece for a typical laptop or small desktop by 2004).|$|E
25|$|Ireland {{was subject}} to a similar attack. In June 1631 Murat Reis, with corsairs from Algiers and armed troops of the Ottoman Empire, stormed ashore at the little harbor village of Baltimore, County Cork. They {{captured}} almost all the villagers and took them away {{to a life of}} slavery in North Africa. The prisoners were destined for a variety of fates— some lived out their days <b>chained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> oars as galley slaves, while women spent long years as concubines in harems or within the walls of the sultan's palace. Only two of these captives ever returned to Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{the popular}} image of rowers <b>chained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> oars, {{conveyed}} by movies such as Ben Hur, {{there is no evidence}} that ancient navies ever made use of condemned criminals or slaves as oarsmen, with the possible exception of Ptolemaic Egypt. Literary evidence indicates that Greek and Roman navies relied on paid labor or ordinary soldiers to man their galleys. Slaves were put at the oars only in times of extreme crisis. In some cases, these people were given freedom thereafter, while in others they began their service aboard as free men. Roman merchant vessels (usually sailing vessels) were manned by slaves, sometimes even with slaves as ship's master, but this was seldom the case in merchant galleys.|$|E

50|$|To {{transfer}} power from all pedals <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear wheel requires a drive train. Typically, the forward crankset is {{connected by a}} left-side timing <b>chain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear crankset, {{which in turn is}} connected by a right-side <b>chain</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear wheel. This configuration is called crossover rear drive, and requires both of <b>the</b> rear cranks <b>to</b> have chainrings. To work reliably, both of the left-side cranks must be tandem- or left-drive specific <b>to</b> accept <b>the</b> left-hand threading used on left pedals.|$|R

25|$|By {{the time}} of Bowen's arrival war had broken out between France and Britain. He was offered a chance to perform a similar to mission to his earlier voyages to the colonies in Australia, but turned in down in order to serve under Jervis, now {{commander-in-chief}} of an expedition to attack the French colonies in the Caribbean. Bowen joined the fleet as fourth-lieutenant and signal-officer aboard the 98-gun , and after the fleet had rendezvoused at Barbadoes, sailed for Martinique on 3 February 1794. Jervis placed Bowen {{in command of the}} guard and gunboats after the fleet's arrival at Fort de France Bay, and instructed him to prepare an assault on a large French frigate, the Bien Venu, <b>chained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> walls of the fort protecting the city. The frigate was rumoured to hold a number of captured English prisoners, whom the French were threatening to kill by blowing up the frigate, should the British attempt to storm the fort. Bowen developed a plan of attack and on 17 February led an assault force consisting of Boynes barge and a number of small boats. The boats rushed the frigate and the boarding party stormed her successfully. The boarding party killed or drove off all of her crew, with the exception of twenty whom Bowen took prisoner, among them the captain and lieutenant. Finding that there were no British prisoners aboard, Bowen manned the cannon and fired a broadside into the fort. He then took his prisoners off and returned to the British ships. Only the contrary wind prevented Bowen from sailing the frigate out as well.|$|E

500|$|In the {{following}} episode, [...] "It's Coming", {{set in the}} present, Arthur Petrelli, head of Pinehearst, arranges for Sylar to speak with Elle. His aim is to have Sylar use his latent empathic abilities to take powers, rather than doing so through killing. Elle is <b>chained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor in a metal room, still in pain from her ability. She repeatedly attacks him, furious at Sylar for her father's murder, eventually begging him to kill her so that her pain will go away. He forgives her for turning him into a monster and convinces her to forgive herself for her crimes, wanting to take away her pain without killing her. At that moment, Elle's pain disappears and she regains control of her ability. Likewise, Sylar is able to absorb her power. The two appear to rekindle their old feelings for each other as Elle teaches Sylar how to use her ability.|$|E
500|$|After 1945, {{stories of}} the Lalaurie slaves became {{considerably}} more explicit. Jeanne deLavigne, writing in Ghost Stories of Old New Orleans (1946), alleged that Lalaurie had a [...] "sadistic appetite [...] seemed never appeased until she had inflicted on {{one or more of}} her black servitors some hideous form of torture" [...] and claimed that those who responded to the 1834 fire had found [...] "male slaves, stark naked, <b>chained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall, their eyes gouged out, their fingernails pulled off by the roots; others had their joints skinned and festering, great holes in their buttocks where the flesh had been sliced away, their ears hanging by shreds, their lips sewn together... Intestines were pulled out and knotted around naked waists. There were holes in skulls, where a rough stick had been inserted to stir the brains."

500|$|In {{addition}} to the replicas which are seen at Independence National Historical Park, early replicas of the Liberty Bell include the so-called Justice Bell or Women's Liberty Bell, commissioned in 1915 by suffragists to advocate for women's suffrage. This bell had the same legend as the Liberty Bell, with two added words, [...] "establish justice", words taken from the Preamble to the United States Constitution. It also had the clapper <b>chained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bell so it could not sound, symbolizing the inability of women, lacking the vote, to influence political events. The Justice Bell toured extensively to publicize the cause. After {{the passage of the}} Nineteenth Amendment (granting women the vote), the Justice Bell was brought to the front of Independence Hall on August 26, 1920, to finally sound. It remained on a platform before Independence Hall for several months before city officials required that it be taken away, and today is at the Washington Memorial Chapel at Valley Forge.|$|E
