5|$|It {{is crucial}} for these {{definitions}} that edges are only allowed to stay within a single page of the book. As Atneosen already observed, if edges may instead pass from one page to another across {{the spine of the}} book, then every graph may be embedded into a three-page book. For such a three-page topological book embedding in which spine <b>crossings</b> are allowed, every graph can be embedded with at most a logarithmic number of spine <b>crossings</b> per edge, and some graphs need this many spine <b>crossings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since 2008, a local {{resident}}s' scheme gives 50 free <b>crossings</b> to car drivers {{resident in}} the Dartford and Thurrock council areas {{for an annual}} registration fee of £10, with additional <b>crossings</b> at 20p each. On 1 March 2014, this scheme was extended to include privately owned two-axle goods vehicles. A further option was introduced giving unlimited free <b>crossings</b> for £20 annually. Around 44,000 drivers {{take advantage of this}} scheme each year.|$|E

5|$|About 40% of {{the subway}} system runs on surface or {{elevated}} tracks, including steel or cast iron elevated structures, concrete viaducts, embankments, open cuts and surface routes. All of these construction methods are completely grade-separated from road and pedestrian <b>crossings,</b> and most <b>crossings</b> of two subway tracks are grade-separated with flying junctions. The sole exceptions of at-grade junctions of two lines in regular service are the 142nd Street junction, the Rogers junction and the Myrtle Avenue junction, whose tracks both intersect at the same level.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} main line {{immediately}} south of Hellingly, the railway passed over gated level <b>crossings</b> at Park Road and New Road. Farm Siding, a single siding on {{the west of the}} line beyond the <b>crossings,</b> was a collection point for the farm's agricultural produce {{in the early years of}} the railway, but later fell out of use. The line climbed most of the way from here to the hospital at 1 in 50. About halfway between Hellingly and the hospital the line entered the hospital grounds, passing to the west of Park House Siding, which served the hospital's Park House annexe.|$|E

5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the vehicular river <b>crossings.</b> At three places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges. The fords offer visitors {{a chance to}} actually drive through the creek, though high water frequently closes the <b>crossings.</b> Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an emergency exit from the campground. When high water closes the fords, the campground is cut off and the emergency exit is the only way out.|$|E

5|$|Most Egyptian {{vultures}} in the subtropical zone of Europe migrate {{south to}} Africa in winter. Like many other large soaring migrants, they avoid making long <b>crossings</b> over water. Italian birds cross over through Sicily and into Tunisia making short sea <b>crossings</b> by {{passing through the}} islands of Marettimo and Pantelleria. Those that migrate through the Iberian Peninsula cross into Africa over the Strait of Gibraltar while others cross further east through the Levant. In summer, some African birds fly further north into Europe and vagrants have been recorded in England and southern Sweden.|$|E
5|$|On February 25, 1937, the Port Richmond–Tower Hill viaduct was completed, {{becoming}} the largest grade crossing elimination {{project in the}} United States. The viaduct {{was more than a}} mile long, and spanned eight grade <b>crossings</b> on the North Shore Branch of the SIRT. The opening of the viaduct marked the final part of a $6,000,000 grade crossing elimination project on Staten Island, which eliminated thirty-four grade <b>crossings</b> on the north and south shores of Staten Island.|$|E

5|$|The Whitestone Branch {{would have}} had to be rebuilt if it were leased to the subway, with {{railroad}} <b>crossings</b> removed and the single track doubled. The PSC located 14 places where <b>crossings</b> needed to be eliminated. However, by early 1917, there was barely enough money to build the subway to Flushing, let alone a link to Whitestone and Bayside. A lease agreement was announced on October 16, 1917, but the IRT withdrew from the agreement a month later, citing that it was inappropriate to enter such an agreement at that time. Thereafter, the PSC instead turned its attention back to the Main Street subway extension.|$|E
