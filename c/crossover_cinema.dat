40|$|This {{thesis is}} a two-part {{exploration}} {{of a new}} type of novel-cum-short-story-collection hybrid - 'splice-fiction' - that has become increasingly prevalent over the last decade. The first part is an academic inquiry into the emergence and nature of the form. It charts the rise of splice-fiction amid changing notions of what a novel is / can be and considers what forces (market pressure, fractured life experiences, changing global realities, <b>crossover</b> influence from <b>cinema)</b> might have called the form into being. " Through examination of contemporary examples (eg. Tim Winton's The Turning, Sarah Hall's How to Paint a Dead Man, David Mitchell's Ghostwritten) in the light of authors identified as forerunners (V. S. Naipaul's In a Free State, Alice Munro's Lives of Girls and Women [...] .), as well as secondary material and interviews with some of the authors, it seeks to discover the form's essential characteristics. The second part is a novel, Africa Junction, which exemplifies the form and articulates these characteristics, which include a wide geographical and time range, polyphony, a multi-strand narrative, tangential connections.

Godzilla, Mothra and Rodan (Radon) each first appeared in standalone films before being set against each other or even teaming up against stronger enemies. Their first encounter was in 1964, first in Mothra vs. Godzilla and a few months later of all three in Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster. In 1962 Toho released King Kong vs. Godzilla.

40|$|In this collection, {{the term}} <b>crossover</b> <b>cinema</b> {{is used to}} {{encapsulate}} an emerging form of cinema that crosses cultural borders at the stage of conceptualization and production and hence manifests a hybrid cinematic grammar at the textual level, as well as crossing over {{in terms of its}} distribution and reception. It argues for the importance of distinguishing between <b>crossover</b> <b>cinema</b> and transnational cinema. While the latter label has been important in enabling the recognition and consideration of the impact of post–World War II migration and globalization on film practice and scholarship, and while it constituted a significant advance on the term with which is so often conflated, world cinema, this chapter argues for a repositioning of the former term as more definitive of the contemporary cultural epoch. The extension of scope in this manner more accurately reflects the highly contingent ways in which global flows in both production and consumption have shaped cinema—not only in the locations of so-called Third Cinema but also in the West. Such a repositioning enables us to think of cross-culturally conceptualized cinema as lying beyond the exclusive art house category that often restricts (a) its reading by film scholars and critics; (b) its publicity discourses and availability in mainstream cinemas; and (c) its reception by various audience communities. There is also an appropriate political objective in the adoption of the term crossover to describe cross-culturally conceptualized cinema. This is because with an extended scope, it joins forces with the broader project of internationalizing cultural studies, that is, to keep the competing forces of cultural indigenization and capitalist internationalization from becoming synonymous with globalization (see Abbas and Erni 2005) ...|$|E

This article seeks to provide {{a contribution to the}} contemporary writing on transnational cinema. By acknowledging the prolific literature that characterizes transnational cinema through specific categories of cultural and societal mobilization, and the writing on <b>crossover</b> <b>cinema,</b> this work aims to enter into a dialogue with the respective authors and propose a less structured approach to transnational mobilization. To study such mobilizations and its complex forms, co-production ventures were used as case studies to highlight the efforts of early international joint endeavours, and more recently, those of outsourcing agencies, as being nodes for changing forms of international collaborations. By focusing on Italian Indian co-produced films, this work situates co-production studies within the literature on transnational cinema, and unsettles fixed cinematic categories in favor of a more mobile and fluid paradigm. Hence, the term Liminal cinema is proposed to critically assess and emphasize the dynamics of the complex phenomenon of transnational cinema-in-motion...|$|E
