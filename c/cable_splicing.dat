50|$|Across the United States and Canada {{more than}} 200 local Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committees (JATCs) use the NJATC’s {{curricula}} to help train electrical apprentices. The NJATC develops electrical training curricula for Inside Wireman, Outside Lineman, Voice-Data-Video (VDV), and Residential Wireman programs. Emerging {{technologies such as}} photovoltaics (solar), wind power generation and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are also encompassed in the NJATC curricula, along with codes and safety and instrumentation training. The organization is also responsible for spearheading a variety of electrical industry certifications such as <b>cable</b> <b>splicing</b> and conduit bending.|$|E
5000|$|A lazarette {{is usually}} a storage locker used for gear or {{equipment}} a sailor or boatswain would use around the decks on a sailing vessel. It is typically found below the weather deck in {{the stern of the}} vessel and is accessed through a hatch if accessed from the main deck or a doorway if accessed from below decks. The equipment usually stored in a lazarette would be spare lines, sails, sail repair, line and <b>cable</b> <b>splicing</b> repair equipment, fenders, bosun chair, spare blocks, tools, and other equipment.|$|E
5000|$|When {{working on}} aerial <b>cable</b> <b>splicing</b> and installation, {{it is common}} to use a {{telephone}} lineman's set or [...] "Butt Set" [...] to communicate over long distances. To facilitate this, extra pairs of wires are embedded in cables. One extra pair (Red-White) may be embedded into cables that are 6 to 75 pairs; two pairs (Red-White and Black-White) may be encapsulated in cables of 100 to 300 pairs; and three pairs (Red-White, Black-White, and Yellow-White) may be included in cables of 400 to 900 pairs. These extra pairs are often referred to as 'talk pairs', and are never used to deliver dial tone.|$|E
25|$|The cable was a -inch (41.275mm) steel <b>cable</b> <b>spliced</b> in two spots, one below each of {{the incline}} {{passenger}} cars and looped in a continuous strand around the grip wheel {{at the top of}} the incline and a tension wheel at the bottom.|$|R
50|$|Seidenberg {{started his}} career as a <b>cable</b> <b>splicer</b> at New York Telephone, {{eventually}} becoming head of NYNEX in 1994. He took a senior position in Bell Atlantic after that company merged with NYNEX. When Bell Atlantic became Verizon, Seidenberg was sole CEO of the company.|$|R
50|$|Buried plant {{consists}} of telecommunications {{equipment such as}} <b>cables,</b> <b>splice</b> closures, lower parts of pedestals, and grounding systems directly buried in the soil. Buried plant can {{be exposed to the}} same corrosive environment as underground plant. In addition, attack by gophers can expose underlying components to corrosion attack.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984, {{the first}} {{photoconductive}} antennas for picosecond electromagnetic radiation were demonstrated by Auston and others. This type of antenna {{became an important}} component in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. In 1984, Karmarkar's algorithm for linear programming was developed by mathematician Narendra Karmarkar. Also in 1984, a divestiture agreement signed in 1982 with the American Federal government forced the break-up of AT&T: Bellcore (now Telcordia Technologies) was split off from Bell Laboratories to provide the same R&D functions for the newly created local exchange carriers. AT&T also was limited to using the Bell trademark only in association with Bell Laboratories. Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc. became a wholly owned company of the new AT&T Technologies unit, the former Western Electric. The 5ESS Switch was developed during this transition. In 1985, laser cooling was used to slow and manipulate atoms by Steven Chu and team. In 1985, the modeling language A Mathematical Programming Language AMPL was developed by Robert Fourer, David M. Gay and Brian Kernighan at Bell Laboratories. Also in 1985, Bell Laboratories was awarded the National Medal of Technology [...] "For contribution over decades to modern communication systems". During the 1980s, the operating system Plan 9 from Bell Labs was developed {{as a replacement for}} Unix, which was also developed at Bell Labs in 1969. Also, the Radiodrum, an electronic music instrument played in three space dimensions was invented. In 1988, TAT-8 became the first transatlantic fiber-optic cable. Bell Labs in Freehold developed the 1.3-micron fiber, <b>cable,</b> <b>splicing,</b> laser detector, and 280 Mbit/s repeater for 40,000 telephone-call capacity.|$|E

50|$|The actual icky-pick {{compound}} is a {{very thick}} petroleum-based substance with very high flammability, and consequently is only rated for outdoor use, frequently direct-buried in the ground. An outdoor <b>cable</b> <b>spliced</b> onto an indoor terminal block is prone to leak the gelatin which is a fire hazard, hence in many situations the icky-pic <b>cable</b> is <b>spliced</b> (usually outside the building) to a short run of normal cable which is run in a protective conduit into the building and then terminated. The thick gelatin stains clothing and hands and {{is very difficult to}} remove.|$|R
40|$|Superconducting current {{transformer}} {{has been developed}} and built to supplement the <b>cable</b> <b>splice</b> testing at the Fermilab Short Sample Test Facility (SSTF) [1].

40|$|The {{secondary}} winding {{design of the}} original transformer [1], which was used to study Nb 3 Sn <b>cable</b> <b>splicing</b> techniques, was modified to accommodate a cable sample of about three pitch lengths as opposed to about half a pitch in the previous design. The basic objective of this new transformer was to measure the quench current of SC cables at self-field under various cooling conditions. Possible additional objectives {{by means of a}} faster DAQ system [2] included quench localization and spike detection. To increase the maximum capability of the secondary current, a primary circuit with larger number of turns was designed and fabricated. This improved the maximum secondary current from 22. 5 kA to nearly 28 kA...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the safety assessment of power <b>cable</b> <b>splices</b> connecting different sized 6 / 10 [kV] class power cables. To assess the safety, AC withstand voltage tests, partial discharge tests and impulse tests {{were carried out}} to the <b>cable</b> <b>splice</b> specimens and thermal rise due to overload and cross section of joint were examined as well. As a result, a breakdown due to the 4. 5 [U 0](27 [kV ac]) application could not found for 5 minutes. Under 1. 73 [U 0](10. 4 [kV ac]) application, partial discharges of 4 ～ 8 [pC] were detected. In impulse tests, all the specimens withstood to the standard waveforms of 75 [kV peak](1. 2 × 50 [㎲]) without any breakdowns. In addition, the temperature on the splice rose by 3 [℃] when the 200 [A] flew through the splice for 20 minutes, however the thermal rise of 3 [℃] was considered due to the atmospheric temperature.

2500|$|The Great Incline cable {{mechanism}} was {{engineered by}} Andrew Smith Hallidie of San Francisco cable car fame. It climbed [...] with approximately [...] of <b>cable</b> <b>spliced</b> into a complete loop which raised {{and lowered the}} cars of the Incline. At the Echo summit an incline powerhouse was erected to house the winding motor and gear works which powered the [...] grip wheel. The wheel consisted of 72 clamping “finger” mechanisms which bit down on the cable creating a smooth, non-slip actuation of the winding cable.|$|R
50|$|Crichton {{was born}} in Carrickfergus, Ireland on 15 July 1879. His family moved to the mining hamlet of Northrigg (then Lanarkshire, now West Lothian) {{when he was a}} small boy and he was educated at Northrigg school and then at the nearby Blackridge school. (Source: West Lothian courier 22 November 1918) He served with the Cameron Highlanders for five years, {{including}} in a period in South Africa during the Second Boer War, before moving to New Zealand. He settled in Auckland and worked as a <b>cable</b> <b>splicer.</b>|$|R
50|$|Handholes are {{plastic or}} polymer {{concrete}} structures set below ground with their lids flush {{to the surrounding}} soil, turf, footpath, or road surface. They {{can be used to}} house and protect copper, coaxial, and optical fiber telephone <b>cable</b> <b>splices</b> and distribution elements. They safeguard and provide convenient access to cable termination and branch points, provide flexibility and access for installation operations (e.g., pulling or blowing cables), provide mechanical and environmental protection for splices, allow access for craftsperson work activities, and discourage access by unauthorized persons.|$|R

His father, Nick, served in World War II, {{and after the war}} worked as a <b>cable</b> <b>splicer</b> for New York Telephone. For a time he was a shop steward for his union, the Communications Workers of America. DiNapoli's mother, Adeline, was a records clerk for the county police department. On September 1, 2013 he received the honorary citizenship {{in the small town of}} Paduli, in the province of Benevento - Italy, the birthplace of his paternal grandfather.|$|R
50|$|The Great Incline cable {{mechanism}} was {{engineered by}} Andrew Smith Hallidie of San Francisco cable car fame. It climbed 2200 ft with approximately 6000 ft of <b>cable</b> <b>spliced</b> into a complete loop which raised {{and lowered the}} cars of the Incline. At the Echo summit an incline powerhouse was erected to house the winding motor and gear works which powered the 9 ft grip wheel. The wheel consisted of 72 clamping “finger” mechanisms which bit down on the cable creating a smooth, non-slip actuation of the winding cable.|$|R
50|$|The {{pantographs}} are screw-mounted to {{the roof}} at three points. Pantograph 1 is connected directly through the roof to the main control switch in the engine room; pantograph 2 is connected via a <b>cable</b> <b>splice</b> running along the side wall of the engine room to the main switch. The contact shoes are outfitted with a monitoring system in case of contact shoe breakage. Inside of the contact shoe, which is made of graphite, runs an air channel, which is overpressurised. In case of breakage, the air escapes, causing the pantograph to automatically retract, preventing possible damage to the overhead contact wire.|$|R
50|$|A {{shielded}} cable is {{an electrical cable}} {{of one or more}} insulated conductors enclosed by a common conductive layer. The shield may be composed of braided strands of copper (or other metal, such as aluminium), a non-braided spiral winding of copper tape, or a layer of conducting polymer. Usually this shield is covered with a jacket. The shield acts as a Faraday cage to reduce electrical noise from affecting the signals, and to reduce electromagnetic radiation that may interfere with other devices. (For more, see electromagnetic interference). The shield minimizes capacitively coupled noise from other electrical sources. The shield must be applied across <b>cable</b> <b>splices.</b>|$|R
50|$|Telecom NIS {{typically}} {{consists of}} the physical network inventory and logical network inventory. Physical network inventory is used to manage outside plant components, such as <b>cables,</b> <b>splices,</b> ducts, trenches, nodes and inside plant components such as active and passive devices. The most differentiating factor of telecom NIS from traditional GIS is the capability of recording thread level connectivity. The logical network inventory is used to manage the logical connections and circuits utilizing the logical connections. Traditionally, the logical network inventory has been a separate product but in most modern systems the functionality is built in the GIS serving both the functionality of the physical network and logical network.|$|R
5000|$|The US Army Signal Corps K-38 trailer, <b>cable</b> <b>splicer,</b> 1/4 ton, 2 - wheel, {{seems to}} have been a {{standard}} civilian American Telephone & Telegraph designed product from the 1930s that was adopted into military service, and later augmented by the K-38A, a modified Willys MB/GPW jeep trailer which was outfitted for the same work - the repair and maintenance of lead-wiped telephone cable joints. The parts list below was published in January 1945, which supports the assumption that both types were in use at the end of World War II. Identical civilian trailers dated as late as 1948 have been found, albeit with slightly different wheels.|$|R
50|$|Fiber to {{the office}} (FTTO) is an {{alternative}} cabling concept for LAN network office environments. It combines passive elements (fibre optic <b>cabling,</b> patch panels, <b>splice</b> boxes, connectors and standard copper 8P8C patch cords) and active mini-switches (called FTTO switches) to provide end devices with Gigabit Ethernet. FTTO involves centralised optical fibre cabling techniques to create a combined backbone/horizontal channel; this channel is provided from the work areas to the centralised cross-connect or interconnect by allowing the use of pull-through <b>cables</b> or <b>splices</b> in the telecommunications room.|$|R
