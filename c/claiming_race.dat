25|$|A {{longtime}} {{thoroughbred horse}} racing enthusiast, Bell met future jockey Johnny Longden {{as a young}} man in Calgary, and later bought a horse from Longden, Mac Aurelius, whose victory in a Regina <b>claiming</b> <b>race</b> fueled Bell's interest in the sport.

500|$|As a foal, he was nicknamed [...] "Junior" [...] {{because of}} his {{resemblance}} to his sire, Lucky Pulpit. [...] Lucky Pulpit had won three races, placed in several graded stakes races, and hit the board in 13 of his 22 starts. However, a viral respiratory infection damaged his breathing and limited him to racing over short distances. California Chrome's dam is Love the Chase, and he was her first foal. She was purchased for $30,000 as a two-year-old by an agent for a horse ownership group called the Blinkers On Racing Stable. As a two- and three-year-old filly, she was anxious in the saddling paddock, and as a result, often lost races before she ever got to the starting gate. She ran six times and won on her fourth try in a February 2009 maiden <b>claiming</b> <b>race</b> at Golden Gate Fields. After her win, Steve Coburn and Perry Martin became her owners, ran her two more times, then retired her later that year. They hoped she would become a good broodmare, as she had a promising pedigree. When she retired, {{it was discovered that}} she had raced with a breathing problem—an entrapped epiglottis that restricted her air intake, but which could be corrected with surgery. [...] , she had given birth to four foals, the two fillies and a colt, all full siblings to California Chrome. After California Chrome became a Kentucky Derby contender, Martin and Coburn turned down an offer of $2.1million for Love the Chase, and ultimately sold her in November 2016 for $1.95 million.|$|E

50|$|<b>Claiming</b> <b>races</b> serve several purposes.
