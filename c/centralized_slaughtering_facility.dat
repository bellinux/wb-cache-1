40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} carried out to assess the energy {{recovery}} potential from organic industrial by-products of a cattle <b>slaughtering</b> <b>facility.</b> There are several processes to convert organic material to energy; the technology {{of interest in this}} study was anaerobic digestion, the biological conversion of degradable organic material into methane. The scenario was initially confined to a full scale cattle <b>slaughtering</b> <b>facility</b> processing 3. 28 % of heads slaughtered in Ireland. The methane potential of dissolved air flotation sludge, paunch, soft offal as well as a mixed waste stream (combination of individual waste streams) was determined through a series of biochemical methane potential assays under mesophilic conditions. The methane potential of the characterised waste streams ranged from 49. 5 to 650. 9  mLCH 4  gVS− 1. The potential energy recovery from the mixed waste stream resulted in the prospective subsidy of 100 % of the energy demands of the <b>slaughtering</b> <b>facility</b> as well as the energy demands for the production of the biogas. When investigating the impact of energy recovery from the entire sector the potential energy recovery equated to 1. 63 % of the final energy demands of the Irish industrial sector. This could potentially increase the RES in Ireland from 7. 8 % to 8. 13 % contributing to both RES-E and RES-H...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/PathobiologyDaniel U. ThomsonCattle {{health and}} welfare are of utmost concern to producers, packers, processors, and {{consumers}} of beef. In addition, poor animal welfare can lead to decreases in economic return, {{in the form of}} production losses, product losses, or even live animal losses. Two major contributors to such losses include carcass bruising and cattle fatigue, or Fatigued Cattle Syndrome. Bruising in fed beef cattle costs the industry millions of dollars annually, and cattle fatigue leads to production losses and animal death during and after transport. Much research in cattle welfare is focused upon the more vulnerable classes of cattle in the industry, such as small calves, cull beef cows, and cull dairy cows. Limited research exists on the animal welfare concerns in fed beef cattle, likely because these animals are considered healthier and better fit for transport compared to other classes. The overall goal of this research was to assess the {{health and welfare}} of fed cattle after transport to commercial <b>slaughter</b> <b>facilities</b> by addressing two large concerns in the industry: 1) bruising in fed cattle and 2) Fatigued Cattle Syndrome and its prevalence and physiologic characteristics. The first objective of this research focused upon bruising, and was to determine whether a relationship exists between trauma incurred during unloading and prevalence of carcass bruising in finished beef cattle at commercial <b>slaughter</b> <b>facilities.</b> In addition, other risk factors which may contribute to carcass bruising in finished beef cattle are addressed. The second and third objectives focused upon Fatigued Cattle Syndrome in the fed cattle population. The second objective of this research was to determine the prevalence of abnormal mobility scores and the clinical signs associated with to abnormal mobility in finished cattle in six commercial <b>slaughter</b> <b>facilities</b> across the United States. The third objective was to determine if mobility score and clinical signs reflect concurrent changes in physiologic parameters such as blood concentrations of specific biochemical markers and biomechanical integrity of hooves. This information is both valuable and novel in the fed beef cattle industry. Along with the implementation of practices that will promote better health and welfare of fed cattle presented to <b>slaughter</b> <b>facilities,</b> gathering such information will help improve animal welfare, increase economic returns, and strengthen consumer confidence in the industry...|$|R
50|$|Livestock {{production}} {{is limited in}} part because of traditional patterns of livestock ownership that have hampered commercialization.

The majority considered a veterinarian as their first choice for information concerning dairy market food safety, with more than 33 % reporting that they would pay for veterinarians to perform food safety assessments. Nearly half {{reported that they had}} been well informed by their veterinarian concerning food safety issues. Income from market beef was important to 75 %, but few had toured a <b>slaughter</b> <b>facility</b> and less than 35 % were aware that HACCP was required in U.

Several reported that they would change practices if so doing would increase profits and most preferred that profits come from incentives paid by slaughter establishments. Few preferred government subsidies and most opposed on-farm government regulatory programs. Ultimately, respondents expected consumers to pay for on-farm food safety practices and expected little of the corresponding increase in price to trickle to them. Overall, results indicate that producers might benefit from better knowledge of HACCP.
