Having affirmed the position taken in Anisminic, Lord Dyson then qualified his statement by emphasizing that [...] "the scope of judicial review should be no more (as well as no less) than is proportionate and necessary for the maintaining of the rule of law". On the facts of the case, he found it was neither proportionate nor necessary for the maintenance of the rule of law to require unrestricted judicial review. By enacting the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, Parliament had rationalized the system of administrative tribunals and had created the Upper Tribunal to hear appeals from lower tribunals, thus avoiding the ordinary courts from being overwhelmed by judicial review applications. As the system of tribunals provided ample opportunity for the <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> of law, this substantive policy reason precluded the need for all decisions of the Upper Tribunal to be subject to judicial review. Thus, judicial review would only be permitted from an Upper Tribunal decision if it would [...] "raise some important point of principle or practice" [...] or there was [...] "some other compelling reason".|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} effects <b>of</b> full <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> {{refractive}} <b>errors</b> on the reliability indices during automated perimetry. Methods: In this retrospective study, records of all patients who underwent automated perimetry during June to July 2008 were reviewed. We compared {{the records of}} the patients who underwent automated perimetry without any refractive error correction or only partial <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> refractive <b>errors</b> (Group 1) with those having full <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> refractive <b>errors</b> (Group 2) during visual field testing. We analyzed whether full <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> the refractive <b>errors</b> during visual field testing improved the reliability indices (false-positive errors, false-negative errors, and fixation losses) of the visual fields. Results: There was improvement in reliability indices after full <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> refractive <b>errors,</b> but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0. 3). Males showed better reliability than females (p = 0. 07). Subjects aged 60 years or younger had more reliable fields (p = 0. 02). Conclusions: Imposing full refractive error correction as opposed to partial refractive error correction did not significantly alter the reliability of visual fields during automated perimetry. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
