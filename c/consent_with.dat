25|$|Following a {{remarkable}} run of seven major trophies in seven years, Leinsters title run {{came to an}} end following the 2013/14 season. The 2014–15 season saw a dip in form, with Leinster finishing in fifth place in the league and failing to make the play-offs. However fortunes in the newly formed Champions Cup were better, with the team reaching the semi-final where they were defeated in extra-time by eventual winners, Toulon. At the end of the season, Head Coach, Matt O'Connor, left the club by mutual <b>consent</b> <b>with</b> former club captain, Leo Cullen, being named as his replacement.|$|E
25|$|Constitutionally, New South Wales {{was founded}} as an autocracy {{run by the}} Governor, {{although}} he nearly always exercised his powers within the restraints of British law. In practice the early Governors ruled by <b>consent,</b> <b>with</b> the advice of military officers, officials and leading settlers. The New South Wales Corps was formed in England in 1789 as a permanent regiment to relieve the marines who had accompanied the First Fleet. Officers of the Corps soon {{became involved in the}} corrupt and lucrative rum trade in the colony. In the Rum Rebellion of 1808, the Corps, working closely with the newly established wool trader John Macarthur, staged the only successful armed takeover of government in Australian history, deposing Governor William Bligh and instigating a brief period of military rule in the colony prior to the arrival from Britain of Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1810.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 20 September 2007, Mourinho {{announced}} his exit as Chelsea manager by mutual <b>consent</b> <b>with</b> the club following a meeting with the board. The former Israel coach and Chelsea's director of football, Avram Grant, was named as his replacement. Ever since Grant had joined Chelsea in 2007, there had been friction between him and Mourinho. Mourinho reportedly told Grant not to interfere in team affairs but, with Abramovich's backing, Grant's profile at the club rose after he was made a member of the board. This event apparently did not go down well with Mourinho and may have contributed to his surprise departure. Grant led Chelsea to the position of runners-up in the Premiership and the club's first appearance in the Champions League final, beaten by Manchester United on both accounts. Nevertheless, on 24 May 2008, Grant was sacked as manager by Abramovich.|$|E

25|$|A {{team can}} acquire players through {{any of the}} three ways: the annual player auction, trading players with other teams during the trading windows, and signing {{replacements}} for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction and also set their base price, and are bought by the franchise that bids the highest for them. Unsold players at the auction are eligible to be signed up as replacement signings. In the trading windows, a player can only be traded with his <b>consent,</b> <b>with</b> the franchise paying the difference if any between the old and new contract. If the new contract is worth more than the older one, the difference is shared between the player and the franchise selling the player. There are generally three trading windows–two before the auction, and one after the auction but {{before the start of the}} tournament. Players can not be traded outside the trading windows or during the tournament, whereas replacements can be signed before or during the tournament.|$|E
25|$|When Mickey visits {{his sister}} Dawn in France in 2005, he was {{surprised}} to discover that she is living with their biological father, Mike. Mickey is unimpressed with his father's sudden return; he refuses to forgive Mike for his prior neglect, and they fight when Mike makes derogatory comments about Rosie. Mike tries to make excuses for his absence, but Mickey refuses to believe him. They eventually call an uneasy truce, but Mike alienates his son further when he tries to con his friend Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi) out of his life savings. Mickey enters into a relationship with Li Chong (Elizabeth Tan) in 2007, and they eventually both move into Gus Smith's (Mohammed George) flat. Li often tests the relationship, infuriating Mickey by growing cannabis in their closet, and then involving him in a money-making scam by advertising him as a male escort without his <b>consent.</b> <b>With</b> persuasion, Mickey agrees to do the male escorting, but Li proves too jealous of his flirtations with other women, so their scam soon ends. Li abruptly ends the relationship when Mickey starts getting too serious for her.|$|E

Ginsburg stated that the government had clearly failed its caretaker duties. [...] Ginsburg was joined by Justice Breyer in the concurrence.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Straus joined Temple Sinai {{as senior}} rabbi in December 2011. A {{graduate}} of HUC, {{he had previously}} served as assistant rabbi of Peninsula Temple Sholom in Burlingame, California, Temple Beth Sholom of New City, New York, and most recently for 13 years as rabbi of Temple Emanuel of Tempe, Arizona. [...] Rabbi Straus resigned his position in 2014 by mutual <b>consent</b> <b>with</b> the Board of Trustees. In January 2015, Rabbi Mates-Muchin was overwhelmingly elected senior rabbi. [...] As of 2014, Temple Sinai, the East Bay's oldest synagogue, had nearly 1,000 member families. The full-time rabbis were Mates-Muchin and Yoni Regev, and the cantor was Ilene Keys.|$|E
500|$|The {{increased}} use of sharing agreements by media companies to form consolidated, [...] "virtual" [...] duopolies became controversial between 2009 and 2014, especially arrangements where a company buys a television station's facilities and assets, but sells the license to an affiliated third-party [...] "shell" [...] corporation, who then enters into agreements with {{the owner of the}} facilities to operate the station on their behalf. Activists have argued that broadcasters were using these agreements as a loophole for the FCC's ownership regulations, that they reduce the number of local media outlets in a market through the aggregation or outright consolidation of news programming, and allow station owners to have increased leverage in the negotiation of retransmission <b>consent</b> <b>with</b> local subscription television providers. Station owners have contended that these sharing agreements allow streamlined, cost-effective operations that may be beneficial to the continued operation of lower-rated and/or financially weaker stations, especially in smaller markets.|$|E

500|$|In 1918, while {{teaching}} in Geneva, Szigeti met {{and fell in}} love with Wanda Ostrowska. She was born in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a finishing school in Geneva. In 1919, Szigeti and Ostrowska decided to get married, but due to the turbulent political situation in Europe, many unexpected bureaucratic obstacles were thrown up in their path. The first problem was the impossibility of contacting Ostrowska's family, and the couple were forced to go ahead without parental <b>consent,</b> <b>with</b> the permission only of Ostrowska's sister and the headmistress of the finishing school. Further bureaucratic entanglements threatened the young couple's hopes, but eventually the officials responsible granted them a dispensation to marry. Szigeti recalls in his memoirs the words of Consul General Baron de Montlong at the critical moment: Let us not, if we can avoid it, fall victim to the dead letter of the law. I don't want to postpone the happiness of these two youngsters if we can help it. All laws have been twisted and tortured out of semblance of law, what with war and revolutions. For once let's twist and turn one for a good cause, yes? ...|$|E
500|$|His {{contract}} was terminated by mutual <b>consent</b> <b>with</b> {{a year to}} run on 16 June 2008 and he joined Wycombe later that day. On joining Wycombe, Mousinho said [...] "It's been my local club since I was quite young so I've been down here {{a few times and}} it was the lure of that, plus the chance to work with Peter Taylor, that made me jump at the chance". He made his debut for Wycombe in a 1–1 draw against Morecambe, and scored his first goal for the club shortly after in a 2–0 away victory over Chester City. Shortly after this, Wycombe triggered a one–year extension clause in his contract, subsequently keeping him at the club until 2010. Mousinho scored his second goal of the season in Wycombe's 3–3 draw against his former employers, Brentford, netting in the first–half of the game with a volley. Two weeks later, he provided the assist for John Akinde's goal in the club's 1–1 draw with Barnet. He played a total of 38 times in all competitions during his first season with the club, scoring twice as Wycombe earned promotion to League One after finishing in the third and final automatic promotion place. The following season, he played a further 41 games for the club, scoring once in a 5–2 home defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion, but Wycombe were relegated {{at the end of the}} season. During his two years at Wycombe, he played a total of 79 times for the club, scoring three goals.|$|E

2500|$|There were public {{concerns}} about {{the height of the}} new structure and its shading effect on many nearby houses.

2500|$|Although, {{the name}} Sogod already existed before the 1600s, the Mancao account {{remains to be}} the {{accepted}} etymological origin {{of the name of}} the town. However, it might be deduced that the first name, which is pronounced as (sú.gut.), which literally means [...] "to consent" [...] or [...] "to comply," [...] fits the Escalante description as a bustling commercial town of the pre-Hispanic era. The major means of initiating trade during those days were done in barter, that is to comply, or to <b>consent</b> <b>with</b> the suggested value offered by the merchant to the townsfolk of Sogod - [...] "ming-súgut." [...] Tugud, on the other hand, seems like a concealed version of the former. The Spaniards, as accounted by many town histories in Leyte , have difficulty reading and pronouncing Visayan.|$|E
