The Assembly called Constituent, destroyed all such institutions very early. The primary and secondary assemblies, by their original constitution, were to be dissolved when they answered the purpose of electing the magistrates, and were expressly disqualified from performing any <b>corporate</b> <b>act</b> whatsoever. The transient magistrates have been almost all removed before the expiration of their terms, and new have been lately imposed upon the people without the form or ceremony of an election. These magistrates during their existence are put under, as all the executive authorities are from first to last, the popular societies (called Jacobin clubs) of the several countries, and this by an express order of the National Convention: it is even made a case of death to oppose or attack those clubs. They, too, have been lately subjected to an expurgatory scrutiny, to drive out from them everything savoring of what they call the crime of moderantism, of which offence, however, few were guilty. But as people began to take refuge from their persecutions amongst themselves, they have driven them from that last asylum.|$|E

He furthermore collaborated in the reform of the Austrian act on reorganisations (mergers, divisions, conversions) made necessary by the Austrian EU company law amendment act of 1996 as part of a working committee of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Justice.

5000|$|Even {{though the}} {{movement}} is held to have originated between the wars, it only lost its Anglo-catholic connotations and started to gain popular momentum in the 1960s.

It was key {{to the extent that}} the terms [...] "the Parish and People movement" [...] and [...] "the Parish Communion movement" [...] are used synonymously. The Parish and People movement has sometimes been conceived of as being representative of central Churchmen in that it was not low Church in its views but not strictly speaking Anglo-catholic either. [...] The movement could be regarded as having achieved its aims given that the National Evangelical Anglican Congress in the Keele statement of 1967, acknowledging that the Church is moving in a new direction as a result of Anglo-catholicism, the Liturgical Movement and the Parish Communion movement, stated its members planned to make a weekly celebration of communion the main <b>corporate</b> <b>act</b> of worship in their parishes.|$|E

In addition, readers of online reviews who attribute the content of the response to external motivations are more likely to improve their attitude towards the hotel. This external attribution and, by extension, level of attitude toward the reviewed hotel could be leveraged by the response-voice and the relative respondent position...|$|E

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} the corporate takeover regime and defensive measures against hostile takeover bids in Slovenia. Although takeover legislation does not differentiate between hostile and friendly takeover, it prescribes {{the limitation of}} powers {{for the management of}} the target company, with the intention of preventing the use of defensive measures against the hostile takeover. In light of an expected rise in hostile takeover bids in Slovenia, the <b>Corporate</b> <b>Act</b> and the Takeover Act are analysed and accordingly the array of possible preventive measures as well as ad-hoc measures against hostile bids identified and evaluated for their anti-takeover effectiveness. A hostile takeover in Slovenia usually involves a hostile public tender offer at a substantial premium over the prevailing market price for a substantial percentage of the target company’s stock. Managers of target companies use in takeover battles a variety of defensive tactics, which could be controversial because they pose a conflict of interest for management. Duty of neutrality of the management of the target company during takeover process is therefore discussed in connection with the limitation of use of applicable ad hoc defence mechanisms in that period...|$|E

40|$|The {{draft of}} the end of 2005 for a {{revision}} of the Swiss <b>Corporate</b> <b>Act</b> presented proposals regarding the introduction of a liability cap for auditors. Such cap was requested by audit firms and has already been introduced in several European jurisdictions. This essay points out that the same arguments supporting limited liability for auditors equally support liability caps for the members of the board of directors: Confronting board members with a liability exceeding their individual risk capacity causes risk adversity and adverse selection within the pool of potential board members. The merits of a liability cap for auditors, directors and management are discussed from a shareholder’s as well as a creditor’s perspective. Based on this discussion the introduction of an individual cap is proposed, defined for instance on a multiple of the audit fee or individual compensation. Special emphasis is given {{to the role of the}} insurances in such revised regime of directors and auditors liability: Notably, it is proposed that with the introduction of a cap the existing practice of D&O-insurance paid for by the company should be abolished. The standards under which the actions of management and auditors are judged should be clear and foreseeable. This paper therefore proposes the formal introduction of the Business Judgement Rule, respectively an «Audit Judgement Rule», into Swiss Corporate Law...|$|E
