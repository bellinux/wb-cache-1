5|$|In an {{interview}} in December 2011, Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt announced that a Google-designed tablet computer would arrive in six months. During the interview for Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Schmidt stated that the software company would have strong competition against Apple, the designer of the iPad line of tablets. While he did not {{refer to it as}} such, the device was inferred {{to be part of the}} Google Nexus series of <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> using the Android operating system and built by a partnering original equipment manufacturer (OEM).|$|E
25|$|The {{long-term}} goal is that CRIDs {{should be available}} for use by cell phones, PDAs, digital TV receivers and other <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> for fetching content, either from a broadcast stream or over IP-based networks.|$|E
25|$|Like USB2.0 before it, USB3.0 {{dramatically}} improved {{data transfer}} rates compared to its predecessor. It {{was announced in}} late 2008, but <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> were not available {{until the beginning of}} 2010. The USB3.0 interface specifies transfer rates up to 5Gbit/s (625MB/s), compared to USB2.0's 480Mbit/s (60MB/s).|$|E

40|$|Effective {{deployment}} of components is imperative for <b>consumer</b> <b>device</b> manufacturers; these must utilize {{the resources available}} optimally. For single systems this is a standard software engineering problem, but for product-lines new techniques must be devised. These are needed to allow component reuse while minimizing the overhead from cross product components. To achieve this a prototype for a tool to automatically generate and evaluate a deployment for a <b>consumer</b> <b>device</b> has been developed. This system and the motivation behind its development are described below, including directions for its future development. 1...|$|R
25|$|To {{make the}} CRID even more {{globally}} available the IETF will publish {{a request for}} comments specifying {{the use of the}} CRID over the web. This will allow <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> to hook up to content provider servers, much like current browsers look up webservers, requesting content by CRID.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{advantage of}} memory cards {{is that many}} <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> (e.g., digital cameras, portable music players) cannot make use of USB flash drives (even if the device has a USB port), whereas the memory cards used by the devices can be read by PCs with a card reader.|$|E
25|$|Specialized sensors {{can also}} be {{equipped}} within living spaces to monitor the health and general well-being of senior citizens, while also ensuring that proper treatment is being administered and assisting people regain lost mobility via therapy as well. Other <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> to encourage healthy living, such as, connected scales or wearable heart monitors, are also a possibility with the IoT.|$|E
50|$|At CES in 2007, Novint {{announced}} plans to launch the Novint Falcon as a <b>consumer</b> <b>device,</b> and on June 18, 2006 (Tom Anderson's 32nd birthday) Novint launched the world's first <b>consumer</b> 3D touch <b>device,</b> having effectively brought {{the cost of the}} hardware down two orders of magnitude (1/100 of the original cost).|$|R

50|$|On 7 May 2010, Project Canvas {{submitted}} key {{documents to}} the Digital Television Group, making {{the next set}} of technical specifications available to industry. The publication of these documents is in addition to Project Canvas partners' active participation in the DTG Connected TV working groups. The result of this DTG work will be the publication of the UK Connected TV Specification: D-Book 7 by December 2010. In addition to the previously available <b>Consumer</b> <b>Device</b> Platform Specification and Broadcast Content Delivery Specification, further documents were published in the members' area of the DTG web site including the <b>Consumer</b> <b>Device</b> Software Management Specification, IP Content Delivery Specification and System Metadata Model.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the Second World War, {{the subject}} was {{commonly}} known as radio engineering and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and radar, commercial radio, and early television. Later, in post war years, as <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems, computers, and microprocessors. In the mid-to-late 1950s, the term radio engineering gradually {{gave way to the}} name electronic engineering.|$|E
25|$|Flash memory cards, e.g., Secure Digital cards, are {{available}} in various formats and capacities, and are used by many <b>consumer</b> <b>devices.</b> However, while virtually all PCs have USB ports, allowing the use of USB flash drives, memory card readers are not commonly supplied as standard equipment (particularly with desktop computers). Although inexpensive card readers {{are available}} that read many common formats, this results in two pieces of portable equipment (card plus reader) rather than one.|$|E
25|$|On one side, <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> can bid {{for power}} {{based on how}} much {{the owner of the}} device were willing to pay, set ahead of time by the consumer. On the other side, {{suppliers}} can enter bids automatically from their electricity generators, based on how much it would cost to start up and run the generators. Further, the electricity suppliers could perform real-time market analysis to determine return-on-investment for optimizing profitability or reducing end-user cost of goods.|$|E

The effects of a competitive retail electricity market are mixed across states, but generally appear to lower prices in states with high participation and raise prices in states that have little customer participation.|$|E
25|$|LCDs {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of {{applications}} including computer monitors, televisions, instrument panels, aircraft cockpit displays, and indoor and outdoor signage. Small LCD screens are common in portable <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> such as digital cameras, watches, calculators, and mobile telephones, including smartphones. LCD screens are also used on consumer electronics products such as DVD players, video game devices and clocks. LCD screens have replaced heavy, bulky cathode ray tube (CRT) displays in nearly all applications. LCD screens are available in a wider range of screen sizes than CRT and plasma displays, with LCD screens available in sizes ranging from tiny digital watches to huge, big-screen television sets.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} a 2000s {{consumer}} 3D pointing device is the Wii Remote. While primarily a motion-sensing device (that is, it can determine its orientation and direction of movement), Wii Remote can also detect its spatial position by comparing the distance and position of the lights from the IR emitter using its integrated IR camera (since the nunchuk accessory lacks a camera, it can only tell its current heading and orientation). The obvious drawback to {{this approach is that}} it can only produce spatial coordinates while its camera can see the sensor bar. More accurate <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> have since been released, including the PlayStation Move, the Razer Hydra and the controllers part of the HTC Vive virtual reality system. All of these devices can accurately detect position and orientation in 3D space regardless of angle relative to the sensor station.|$|E

25|$|The {{guaranteed}} {{cycle count}} may {{apply only to}} block zero (as {{is the case with}} TSOPNAND devices), or to all blocks (as in NOR). This effect is mitigated in some chip firmware or file system drivers by counting the writes and dynamically remapping blocks in order to spread write operations between sectors; this technique is called wear leveling. Another approach is to perform write verification and remapping to spare sectors in case of write failure, a technique called bad block management (BBM). For portable <b>consumer</b> <b>devices,</b> these wearout management techniques typically extend the life of the flash memory beyond the life of the device itself, and some data loss may be acceptable in these applications. For high reliability data storage, however, it is not advisable to use flash memory that would {{have to go through a}} large number of programming cycles. This limitation is meaningless for 'read-only' applications such as thin clients and routers, which are programmed only once or at most a few times during their lifetimes.|$|E
500|$|By June 2010, Snapdragon chips were {{embedded}} in 20 available <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> and incorporated into 120 product designs in development. Apple had a dominant market position for smartphones {{at the time}} and did not incorporate Snapdragon into any of its products. The success of Snapdragon therefore relied on competing Android phones, such as Google's Nexus One and the HTC Incredible, challenging Apple's market position. Android devices [...] did end up taking market share from the iPhone and predominantly used Snapdragon.|$|E
500|$|The first-generation Nexus7 is a mini tablet {{computer}} co-developed by Google and Asus {{that runs the}} Android operating system. It is the first tablet in the Google Nexus series of Android <b>consumer</b> <b>devices</b> marketed by Google and built by an original equipment manufacturer partner. The Nexus7 features a [...] display, an Nvidia Tegra 3 quad-core chip, 1GB of memory, Wi-Fi and near field communication connectivity, and 8, 16 or 32GB of storage. The tablet was the first device to ship with version 4.1 of Android, nicknamed [...] "Jelly Bean". By emphasizing {{the integration of the}} Google Play multimedia store with Android 4.1, Google intended to market the Nexus7 as an entertainment device and a platform for consuming e-books, television shows, films, games, and music.|$|E
50|$|The {{product and}} service was {{developed}} by WebTV Networks, Inc., a company purchased by Microsoft Corporation and absorbed into MSN (the Microsoft Network).

500|$|The EyeTV {{software}} was updated to version 3.0 in 2008. 3.0 made user interface improvements, {{such as being}} able to mark favorites or automatically record shows in a series. A review in TechRadar gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars. The review noted that EyeTV was the de facto software for TV and computer video integration and praised its new features, but said it was expensive when purchased separately. A 2007 article in MacLife said their [...] "top picks" [...] for USB-powered tuners were those using the EyeTV software, such as the EyeTV hybrid or EyeTV 250. In addition to Elgato's EyeTV line of <b>consumer</b> <b>devices,</b> other brands such as Terratec and Miglia use the EyeTV software in their products through licensing agreements with Elgato.|$|E
2500|$|Aperios is Sony's Proprietary Real-Time Operating system, used in all AIBOs, QRIO {{and some}} other <b>consumer</b> <b>devices.</b> Aperios OS was {{intended}} to be widely deployed using revolutionary real-time capabilities to handle multiple audio and visual data streams concurrently The operating system was not widely adopted, and by 2003 Sony had stopped active development with COO Kunitake Ando commenting [...] "Aperios was an operating system of a pre-Internet age and we decided that it isn't adequate for the future".|$|E
2500|$|Isolation is a {{mechanism}} that defeats grounding.
