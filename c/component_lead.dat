MRP techniques {{are based on}} the assumption that the <b>component</b> <b>lead</b> times are known, and they are the parameters of MRP. However, in a supply chain the <b>component</b> <b>lead</b> times are often random. Therefore, mathematical models were developed to aid in MRP parameterization. The suggested models calculate planned lead times in order to minimize the total average cost. The considered cost is composed of the average component holding and finished product backlogging costs.

40|$|International audienceA {{problem of}} {{inventory}} control for assembly systems is considered where the <b>component</b> <b>lead</b> times are random. A periodic "lot-for-lot" policy for component supply is studied. The decision variables are component planned lead times. The {{aim is to}} minimize the average holding cost for components while keeping a high customer service level for the finished product. When the lead times of {{the different types of}} components follow the same distribution probability, and unit holding costs are identical for all components, an efficient algorithm is proposed. For a more general case with arbitrary distribution and holding costs, some properties and a lower bound on the cost function are proved. These results can be useful for the development of efficient exact optimization algorithms as Branch and Bound.

40|$|The {{suitability}} of various metallic {{printed wiring board}} surface finishes was assessed for new technology applications that incorporate assembly with Lead-free solders. The manufacture of a lead-free product necessitates elimination of lead (Pb) from the solder, the circuit board {{as well as the}} <b>component</b> <b>lead</b> termination. It is critical however for the selected interconnect Pb-free solder and the corresponding printed wiring board (PWB) and <b>component</b> <b>lead</b> finishes to be mutually compatible. Baseline compatibility of select Pb-free solders with Pb containing PWB surface finish and components was assessed. This was followed by examining the compatibility of the commercially available CASTIN{trademark} (SnAgCuSb) Pb-free solder with a series of PWB metallic finishes: Ni/Au, Ni/Pd, and Pd/Cu. The compatibility was assessed with respect to assembly performance, solder joint integrity and long term attachment reliability. Solder joint integrity and mechanical behavior of representative 50 mil pitch 20 I/O SOICs was determined before and after thermal stress. Mechanical pull test studies demonstrated that the strength of SnAgCuSb solder interconnections is notably greater than that of SnPb interconnections...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} order release {{planning}} for a make-toorder production facility is addressed. Traditionally, order-release planning in a multi-stage shop is performed with material requirements planning (MRP) logic. MRP assumes infinite resource capacity and <b>component</b> <b>lead</b> times that are estimated using historical data, past experience, and rules-of-thumb. These assumptions often result in infeasible plans that make the task of scheduling difficult. An approach to order release planning termed qRP (resource planning based on queuing simulation) is discussed. qRP generates order release plans via a backward bill of material explosion logic similar to MRP except that a queuing simulation model of the facility is used. The simulation model captures the appropriate level of detail {{to provide a more}} realistic picture for planning. <b>Component</b> <b>lead</b> times are time-based (dependent on {{the current state of the}} shop) and may change from period to period. Automatic factory and simulation model generators are developed to compare this dynamic lead time approach with the static approach offered by MRP. Generalizations are made for key manufacturing attributes. ...|$|E
