40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of the demands for mobile data, wire-less network faces several challenges, such as lack of {{efficient}} interconnection among heterogeneous wireless networks, and shortage of customized QoS guarantees between services. The fundamental reason for these challenges is that the ra-dio access network (RAN) is closed and ossified. We pro-pose OpenRAN, an architecture for software-defined RAN via virtualization. It achieves <b>complete</b> virtualization and <b>programmability</b> vertically, and benefits the convergence of heterogeneous network horizontally. It provides open, con-trollable, flexible and evolvable wireless networks...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{renewable}} energy sources feed significant shares of energy demand, resulting in a reduction of market energy price but also a significant increase of expenditures for ancillary services due to inherent not <b>complete</b> predictability and <b>programmability.</b> Thus loads and generation in the distribution network {{are more and more}} required to play an active role in supporting grid stability by participating to ancillary service markets, either directly or through aggregators. The paper presents a novel procedure to estimate distribution networks capabilities to support grid stability, by making use of synthetic representation of HV/MV substations and their relevant distribution networks with a GIS based clustering procedure. The impact of active distribution networks to the bulk ancillary service market is then evaluated by applications to the Italian electric system and by assuming different regulatory frameworks for transmission/distribution network market interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project is to design and to implement an advanced full programmable spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system, based on Melzack and Wall gate control theory of pain. The system {{can be used as}} a treatment of choice for certain intractable chronic pain not responding to conventional treatment. The system delivers controlled electrical stimuli to some properly selected nerve fibers along the spinal cord. The stimulation of these nerve fibers modulates pain messages being transmitted to the brain. This thesis presents the design and implementation of the basic component of the system, which is the dedicated microprocessor, as well as the other functional parts that have been integrated together to get a miniaturized implantable device provided with appropriate programming and operating tools. The spinal cord stimulation system described here is mainly composed of three parts: two external units and a surgically implanted module. The first external part consists of a computer-based system with completely graphical software and appropriate hardware interface, intended for the physician to program and to adjust the internal part. The patient, in order to control stimulation at his convenience, will use the second external unit. As for the implanted part, this one is built around a powerful mixed-signal ASIC, which is mounted together with appropriate demodulation and power recovery circuits, a memory (EEPROM), and a few peripheral discrete components. Communication of power and data between external and internal parts is achieved through a transdermal inductive link. The system proposed is very user-friendly and unique in its way of operation, providing an unlimited flexibility and <b>complete</b> external <b>programmability.</b> In fact, it is the only miniaturized system providing the user with the possibility to get different stimulation algorithms simultaneously making it more adaptable to the conditions and the state of the patient. It also provides several original features that make it possible to perform a wide range of stimulation algorithms and to generate an unlimited number of stimulus waveforms. As examples, we can mention the possibility of using combined stimuli through simultaneous stimulation over two channels, the possibility of generating complex current pulse shapes, and the access to a greater number of stimulation parameters.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} the BioWall, a giant {{reconfigurable}} computing tissue developed to implement machines {{according to the}} principles of our Embryonics (embryonic electronics) project. The BioWall’s size and features are designed for public exhibition, {{but at the same time}} it represents an invaluable research tool, particularly since its <b>complete</b> <b>programmability</b> and cellular structure are extremely well adapted to the implementation of many different kinds of bio-inspired systems. To illustrate these capabilities, we present a set of applications that range over many diverse sources of biological inspiration, from Embryonics ' ontogenetic systems, through epigenetic artificial neural networks, to phylogenetic evolving hardware. All these applications have been fully implemented and tested in hardware on the BioWall. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{explain how}} modern {{programmable}} logic devices have capabilities {{that are well}} suited for them to assume {{a central role in}} the implementation of networked systems, now and in the future. To date, such devices have featured largely in ASIC substitution roles within networked systems; this usage has been highly successful, allowing faster times to market and reduced engineering costs. We argue that there are many additional opportunities for productively using these devices. The requirement is exposure of their high inherent computational concurrency matched by concurrent memory accessibility, their rich on-chip interconnectivity and their <b>complete</b> <b>programmability,</b> at a higher level of abstraction that matches the implementation needs of networked systems. We discuss specific examples supporting this view, and present a highly flexible soft platform architecture at an appropriate level of abstraction from physical devices. This may be viewed as a particularly configurable and programmable type of network processor, offering scope both for innovative networked system implementation and for new directions in networking research. In particular, it is aimed at facilitating scalable solutions, matching differently resourced programmable logic devices to differing performance and sophistication requirements of networked systems, from cheap consumer appliances to high-end network switching. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Remote Sensing Group (RSG, www. remotesensinggroup. polito. it) of Politecnico di Torino is {{also the}} local {{research}} unit of CINFAI (Consorzio Interuniversitario Nazionale per la Fisica delle Atmosfere e delle Idrosfere, www. cinfai. it) within the DET (Department of Electronics and Telecommunications). Its activities are devoted to explore new solutions ranging from radar meteorology, to the realization of innovative sensing probes, from Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and RFID tags realization (in order to measure environmental parameters, even deploying them in harsh environment), to the application of commercial technologies in innovative contexts. Within these topics four different activities are presented. The first activity is the realization of a prototype of an X-band FMICW (Frequency Modulated Interrupted Continuous Wave) which was developed for atmospheric monitoring operations (e. g. for rainfall estimation). Its main characteristics are the low cost and the <b>complete</b> software <b>programmability.</b> First results show a good resolution and consistent rain estimation within a range of 3 km. The second topic {{is related to the}} feasibility analysis made to study a set of innovative disposable sensors for atmosphere and precipitation studies. While most monitoring instruments for the atmosphere perform indirect monitoring operation, sensing the parameters from a remote position and not being directly inside the phenomenon, the proposed sensors (very small and light, it weighs less than 15 g) are designed to dynamically behave like hailstones or raindrops in their fluctuations and falling through the atmosphere. During the flight time they can measure atmospheric parameters and send them to a receiver located on the ground. The third presented solution is the realization of a RFID tags-reader system capable to work in very harsh operative conditions. The ad-hoc system was designed to monitor several physical properties of glaciers, the prototype was realized and tested on filed with very good results. The system is made up of a set of RFID tags placed directly inside the ice to perform the measurements and a handheld reader (equipped also with a custom software) to collect data according to user needs. The last activity explores the use of the frequency band of 77 GHz for short range weather radar or a microwave rain gauge. According to ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) such frequency band is dedicated to automatic cruise control long-range radars. Recent studies, including some results presented here, show that is possible to use FMCW radar commonly used to enable a vehicle to maintain a cruising distance from the preceding vehicle as radar for meteorology purposes, with small modifications. The crucial derivation of the relation between the radar reflectivity factor Z [mm 6 m- 3] and rainfall rate R [mm/h] (usually known as "Z-R equation" or "Marshall and Palmer" equation) is necessary in order to prevent heavy underestimation of rain. Some early results obtained with numerical techniques are presented...|$|R
