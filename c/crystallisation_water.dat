The dihydrate salt formed from water, and the anhydrous form obtained from organic solvents, have different crystal structures. The dehydration process carried out at a low temperature is not readily accompanied by the phase transition toward the crystal form of the anhydrous salt. DTA measurements on the dehydrated form of different samples showed an endotherm in the range 73 - 78 °C that represents in all cases the phase transitions from the dehydrated toward the anhydrous form, while the endotherm at a higher temperature (98 - 111 °C) is associated with the melting of the anhydrous form.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} divided into four chapters. They are: introduction, experimental, results and {{discussion}} about the free ligands and results and discussion about the complexes. The First Chapter, the introductory chapter, is a general introduction {{to the study of}} solid state reactions. The Second Chapter is devoted to the materials and experimental methods that have been used for carrying out tile experiments. TIle Third Chapter is concerned with the characterisations of free ligands (Picolinic acid, nicotinic acid, and isonicotinic acid) by using elemental analysis, IR spectra, X-ray diffraction, and mass spectra. Additionally, the thermal behaviour of free ligands in air has been studied by means of thermogravimetry (TG), derivative thermogravimetry (DTG), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. The behaviour of thermal decomposition of the three free ligands was not identical Finally, a computer program has been used for kinetic evaluation of non-isothermal differential scanning calorimetry data according to a composite and single heating rate methods in comparison with the methods due to Ozawa and Kissinger methods. The most probable reaction mechanism for the free ligands was the Avrami-Erofeev equation (A) that described the solid-state nucleation-growth mechanism. The activation parameters of the decomposition reaction for free ligands were calculated and the results of different methods of data analysis were compared and discussed. The Fourth Chapter, the final chapter, deals with the preparation of cobalt, nickel, and copper with mono-pyridine carboxylic acids in aqueous solution. The prepared complexes have been characterised by analyses, IR spectra, X-ray diffraction, magnetic moments, and electronic spectra. The stoichiometry of these compounds was ML 2 x(H 20), (where M = metal ion, L = organic ligand and x = water molecule). The environments of cobalt, nickel, and copper nicotinates and the environments of cobalt and nickel picolinates were octahedral, whereas the environment of copper picolinate [Cu(PA) 2] was tetragonal. However, the environments of cobalt, nickel, and copper isonicotinates were polymeric octahedral structures. The morphological changes that occurred throughout the decomposition were followed by SEM observation. TG, DTG, and DSC measurements have studied the thermal behaviour of the prepared complexes in air. During the degradation processes of the hydrated complexes, the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>water</b> molecules were lost in one or two steps. This was also followed by loss of organic ligands and the metal oxides remained. Comparison between the DTG temperatures of the first and second steps of the dehydration suggested that the water of crystallisation was more strongly bonded with anion in Ni(II) complexes than in the complexes of Co(II) and Cu(II). The intermediate products of decomposition were not identified. The most probable reaction mechanism for the prepared complexes was also Avrami-Erofeev equation (A) characteristic of solid-state nucleation-growth mechanism. The tempemture dependence of conductivity using direct current was determined for cobalt, nickel, Cl. nd copper isonicotinates. An activation energy (ΔΕ), the activation energy (ΔΕ) were calculated. The ternperature and frequency dependence of conductivity, the frequency dependence of dielectric constant, and the dielectric loss for nickel isonicotinate were determined by using altemating current. The value of s paralneter and the value of'density of state [N(Ef) ] were calculated.

The lacunae, the canaliculi and the vascular spaces are unossified, and have been described collectively by Robinson (1960) as the marrow-vascular-osteocyte or M. V. O. space. The lacunae and canaliculi account, fairly constantly, for about one. tenth of the total volume of any region of bone (Robinson 1960), but the vascular spaces vary widely in size from the large cavities characteristic of developing and of osteoporotic bone to the narrow tubular spaces of mature bone.

In these regions, the interaction between alcohols and water ice plays {{a crucial role in the}} surface chemistry. We have therefore undertaken a detailed temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) investigation to elucidate the physical chemistry of the adsorption, desorption and crystallisation of 2 -propanol and water ices adsorbed on graphite at 26 K. Hydrogen bonding plays a critical role in the physical chemistry of both pure 2 -propanol and of binary ices containing 2 -propanol and water ice. Monolayer 2 -propanol physisorbs strongly on the graphite surface, and with increasing coverage, annealing leads to the desorption of first amorphous, and then crystalline, 2 -propanol multilayers. Crystallisation is also evident in RAIR spectra, which show marked changes on annealing of the adsorbed 2 -propanol layer. In binary ice systems containing amorphous solid water and 2 -propanol, the desorption and crystallisation of the alcohol is modified. The water ice inhibits the 2 -propanol crystallisation and gives rise to co-desorption in TPD. In addition, the 2 -propanol also strongly influences the behaviour of the water, with even small amounts of the alcohol changing the <b>crystallisation</b> kinetics of <b>water</b> ice, leading to the desorption of water solely in its amorphous form...|$|R

Self-assembling peptides have proven particularly popular {{building blocks for}} the construction of a variety of well-defined nanostructures. There is a great interest in learning to control not only the types and properties of nanostructures, but also their precise macroscopic organisation. Here we investigate the effect of <b>water</b> <b>crystallisation</b> during freezing as a possible method for directed organisation of preformed β-sheet tapes, ribbons and fibrils and for the production of microporous materials comprising lamella-like layers. We employ a range of short, systematically designed self-assembling peptides and a wide variety of techniques including SEM, TEM, X-ray tomography, X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy and compression testing. We find that ice growth does not alter the peptide nanostructures but templates the formation of lamella-like layers of mesoscopically aligned peptide ribbons and fibrils into nematic-like domains. The lamella are macroscopically oriented into regularly spaced stacks, giving rise to rather brittle peptide aerogels. This behaviour is contrasted with that of other self-assembling networks such as surfactant rod-like micelles and the polysaccharide agar. The differences in the properties of the self-assembling network seem to prescribe the way it will behave during ice crystallisation, and whether or not it will form ordered lamella structures. This approach may lead to the preparation of well-aligned peptide nanostructures, important for high-resolution structural studies; anisotropic microporous materials comprising lamella-like layers of self-assembling peptide fibrils with incorporated protein-like bioactivity may also be useful in medical applications e. g. tissue engineering, and nanotechnology...|$|R
40|$|The Lesser Antilles Volcanic Arc is {{remarkable}} for the abundance {{and variety of}} erupted plutonic xenoliths. These samples provide {{a window into the}} deeper crust and record a more protracted crystallisation history than is observed from lavas alone. We present a detailed petrological and in situ geochemical study of xenoliths from Martinique in order to establish their petrogenesis, pre-eruptive storage conditions and their contribution to construction of the sub-volcanic arc crust. The lavas from Martinique are controlled by crystal–liquid differentiation. Amphibole is rarely present in the erupted lavas, but it is a very common component in plutonic xenoliths, allowing us to directly test the involvement of amphibole in the petrogenesis of arc magmas. The plutonic xenoliths provide both textural and geochemical evidence of open system processes and crystal ‘cargos’. All xenoliths are plagioclase-bearing, with variable proportions of olivine, spinel, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and amphibole, commonly with interstitial melt. In Martinique, the sequence of crystallisation varies in sample type and differs from other islands of the Lesser Antilles arc. The compositional offset between plagioclase (~An 90) and olivine (~Fo 75), suggests <b>crystallisation</b> under high <b>water</b> contents and low pressures from an already fractionated liquid. Texturally, amphibole is either equant (crystallising early in the sequence) or interstitial (crystallising late). Interstitial amphibole is enriched in Ba and LREE compared with early crystallised amphibole and does not follow typical fractionation trends. Modelling of melt compositions indicates that a water-rich, plagioclase-undersaturated reactive melt or fluid percolated through a crystal mush, accompanied by the breakdown of clinopyroxene, and the crystallisation of amphibole. Geothermobarometry estimates and comparisons with experimental studies imply the majority of xenoliths formed in the mid-crust. Martinique cumulate xenoliths are inferred to represent crystal mushes within an open system, through which melt can both percolate and be generated...|$|R

We present a study of the rock strength variations of three representative chalk units (Lewes Chalk, Seaford Chalk and Newhaven Chalk) exposed at various locations on the coastal chalk cliffs. The combination of UCS tests and SEM observations have been used (1) on dry natural chalk samples, (2) on chalk samples at various moisture contents, (3) on dry chalk samples submitted to a 10 -day cycle of alternating wetting and drying by distilled water and by sea water. Dry chalk samples show low UCS strength (3. 46 - 4 MPa) indicative of very weak rocks. When chalk samples are submitted to progressive water wetting, they present a decrease of UCS strength and Young's modulus of 40 % to 50 %. This behaviour begins at low values of water content within the chalk, i. e., for a degree of water saturation ranging between 10 % and 17 %. When chalk samples are submitted to an artificial weathering cycle with distilled water, a decrease in strength is observed, whereas the Young's modulus increases. SEM observations indicate the occurrence of microcracks and particle aggregates in the sample. When chalk samples are submitted to an artificial weathering with sea water, the decrease of UCS strength and Young's modulus achieves a minimum. SEM observations indicate salt crystals within the chalk. On the coastal cliffs of NW France, weathering processes depend both on chalk lithology, which show a range of sensitivity to weathering and on the location of the chalk in the coastal area. Processes allied to the degree of weathering (e. g., salt <b>crystallisation</b> or fresh <b>water</b> disaggregation) differ in the chalk massif, on the cliff face and on the shore platform...|$|R
40|$|The Bay of Cádiz in South of the Iberian Peninsula is {{surrounded}} by a vast area of marshes formerly associated to the mouth of Guadalete River. Since centuries this area has been exploited for natural resources, salt and seafood. Transformation of wetlands and marshes for salt extraction was already documented several centuries ago but was intensified during 18 th and 19 th centuries. The result is a huge area of intricate saltponds, main and secondary sea channels and natural marshes that offers a unique landscape of great ecological and cultural value. The permanence of inundate areas during many months a year along with marshes of tidal influence created an interesting ecosystem with high diversity of macroinvertebrates as well as high biomass productivity. This biological richness explains its use as a natural nursery area for fish coastal communities as alternative to river estuaries. Besides, this area is placed in the route of migratory birds between Europe and Africa. Extensive fish polyculture is an activity that was developed in association to salt works. A typical saltpond property (salina) is formed by a first reservoir pond that takes the water directly from the sea channel throughout a pond-monk, followed by a labyrinth-shaped evaporation ponds system and finally by the <b>crystallisation</b> ponds.

40|$|Butter {{keeping quality}} and pallet {{physical}} stability during {{transport and storage}} are dependent on the temperature distribution through the product. Understanding these temperature changes are of vital importance for the dairy industry with regard to butter manufacture, storage and shipping. Three dimensional mathematical models of heat transfer were developed to predict thawing and freezing in butter products. These models require accurate thermophysical data as an input. Specific heat capacity and enthalpy of butter with different composition was measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The specific heat capacity of butter differs for cooling and heating operations due to significant supercooling and delayed crystallization of the fat fraction of butter at temperatures well below the equilibrium phase change temperature during cooling. This reduces the heat capacity for cooling relative to that for heating. Thawing of individual blocks of butter was accurately predicted by the conduction only model (no mass transfer limitations) with equilibrium thermal properties giving accurate predictions when the butter was completely frozen before thawing. For partially frozen butter the conduction model with the measured temperature dependent specific heat capacity data for unfrozen butter including melting {{of some of the}} fat fraction gave accurate predictions. For freezing it was observed that water in the butter supercools many degrees below its initial freezing point before freezing due to its water in oil structure. Experiments suggested that during freezing release of latent heat observed as a temperature rebound is controlled as much by the rate of <b>crystallisation</b> of <b>water</b> in each of the water droplets as by the rate of heat transfer. A conduction only model including water crystallization kinetics based on the Avrami Model predicted freezing in butter successfully. Simple models with equilibrium thermal properties and nucleation only kinetics (based on homogenous nucleation theory) or the sensible heat only model (no release of latent heat) gave poor predictions. The models for individual blocks were extended to predict heat transfer in butter pallets. A butter pallet contains product, packaging material and the air entrapped between the packaging and butter cartons. Measurements were made for freezing and thawing of full and half pallets at a commercial storage facility and in the University laboratory. Thawing and freezing in wrapped tightly stacked pallets was predicted accurately by the conduction only model with effective thermal properties (incorporating butter, packaging and air) estimated by the parallel model. For unwrapped tightly stacked or loosely stacked pallets there is potential for air flow between the adjacent cartons of butter. An alternative approach was developed which consisted of modeling the pallet on block by block basis using effective heat transfer coefficients for each surface. Different heat transfer coefficients were used on different faces of the blocks depending on the location of the block in the pallet. This approach gave good predictions for both unwrapped tightly stacked and loosely stacked pallets using the estimated effective heat transfer coefficients from the measured data. Further experimental and/or modelling work is required in order to develop guidelines for estimating effective heat transfer coefficient values for internal block face for industrial scenarios...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{focussed}} {{on the question of}} how to grow crystals as large as possible in light of their use as samples for neutron protein crystallography. We concentrated on the early stages of the crystallization process where the directions are set whether many small crystals grow or few large ones. We used lysozyme as a model system since it has been studied well in the past and the phase diagram of its crystal growth is known. In order to study the crystal growth process starting from the very beginning we used a combination of three scattering techniques since the involved size ranges require a large q-range. Small angle neutron scattering was used in combination with static light scattering on the same sample in order to realize this extended q-range and in order to obtain structural information on the growing crystal seeds. In situ dynamic light scattering at the neutron scattering sample cell was used to obtain an overview of all sizes present in the crystallisation process. The small angle neutron scattering technique required a <b>crystallisation</b> in heavy <b>water</b> instead of normal water. We found that the crystallization conditions did not differ too much from the ones mentioned in the literature for light water when using a corrected pD value of pD=pH+ 0. 4. The crystallization is initiated by mixing a 60 mg/ml Lysozyme solution with a 6 wt% NaCl acetate buffer solution (both at pD= 4. 75 and at 298 K) in a 1 : 1 ratio. Immediately after mixing, dimers of lysozyme molecules are formed and the structure factor seen in the lysozyme stock solution disappears. Under the chosen conditions we could observe a fractal growth of the crystal seeds with a change of the fractal dimension from 1. 0 to 1. 7 in the first 90 min. This can be interpreted as a branched crystal seed being formed first which grows more in a linear manner with little branching. Later, the space in between the branched arms is filled to cross over to a more densely packed fractal. With these results theoretical models of crystal growth can be improved. Furthermore, the early detection of crystal seeds can be used to rapidly change the crystallization conditions (e. g. temperature) in order to avoid the production of more crystal seeds...|$|R

While much {{is known about the}} behaviour of many gas hydrate systems at highpressure, the CO 2 hydrate system is less well studied, with apparent hydrate dissociation at just 10 kbar, and (prior to this work) an unsolved crystalline phase in the pressure range 6 - 10 kbar. In this work the CO 2 -H 2 O system has been studied at high-pressure and, by heating samples to the liquid state and observing their behaviour on refreezing, it has been confirmed that there are indeed no hydrate phases in the system above 10 kbar (up to at least 40 kbar). While performing this investigation, an interesting effect of CO 2 on the behaviour of <b>water</b> <b>crystallisation</b> was also observed, and additionally, a simple yet effective technique for making solubility measurements in the system at high-pressure has been discovered. Using a combination of neutron and x-ray diffraction techniques, the crystal structure of the previously unsolved ‘HP’ CO 2 hydrate phase has been determined by ab-initio methods. It {{has been found to be}} a new gas hydrate structure, but is shared by a small number of Zintl compounds, and may also be common to the unsolved C 0 phase of H 2 hydrate. The structure has a characteristic spiral of guest molecule sites, leading to its suggested label as the spiral hydrate structure (s-Sp). Its composition has been measured as a tri-hydrate, and the compressibility of s-Sp and the low-pressure s-I CO 2 hydrate phases have also been measured. On cooling to 77 K it has been discovered that a third CO 2 hydrate phase is formed with a significantly larger unit cell, which is thought to possess a structure similar to that of s-Sp, but with an ordered arrangement of CO 2 molecules. Finally, a pilot study of the high-pressure behaviour of the binary H 2 -CO 2 hydrate system has been performed. Using Raman spectroscopy it has been found that a new mixed hydrate phase exists in the pressure range 5 - 15 kbar, and it is speculated that this could exhibit a freely tunable H 2 /CO 2 content, based on suspicion that it forms the s-Sp structure.

Overall, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of 14 : 0, and {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of 18 : 0, from November to June; and there was a significant difference in the mean proportion of 16 : 0, and also 18 : 1, between the two seasons. There was a significant difference in the proportion of cis monounsaturated triglycerides, and the more highly unsaturated triglycerides, between some of the different tallows analysed. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of 2 -oleo disaturated triglycerides from November to June, with a range from 10. 0 % (May, 1978) to 20. 5 % (November, 1976). An acetone fractionation scheme was developed with the main aim of concentrating these 2 -oleo disaturated triglycerides into one fraction (the intermediate fraction) which may be useful as a cocoa butter replacer. The first precipitate (the hard fraction was separated by filtration, and the filtrate was adjusted for solvent : fat ratio and then further cooled to precipitate the intermediate fraction. After separation of this precipitate, acetone was distilled from the filtrate to produce a final fraction (the soft fraction). A screening experiment showed that the solvent : fat ratio at each crystallisation, the temperature to which the fat solution was cooled at each <b>crystallisation,</b> the <b>water</b> content of the acetone and the degree of agitation during crystallisation all affected the fractionation. The effect of these variables upon one sample of mutton tallow was studied, and mathematical models were developed to predict the yields of the three fractions and the melting properties of the intermediate fraction, The model predicting the melting properties of the intermediate fraction was used to estimate the fractionation conditions which would give an intermediate fraction with melting properties most similar to those of cocoa butter. From this, a fractionation was performed with first and second crystallisation temperatures of 9. 2 °C and 5. 2 °C respectively, solvent to fat ratios at the first and second crystallisations of 1. 0 : 1 and 10. 0 : 1 respectively, a water concentration in the acetone of 0. 6 % and a defined agitation condition. The yields of the hard, intermediate and soft fractions were 34. 5 wt %, 2. 5 wt % and 63. 0 wt % of the tallow respectively. The intermediate fraction contained 51. 0 % of 2 -oleo disaturated triglycerides (compared to 68. 9 % in cocoa butter) and had very similar melting properties to cocoa butter. Then the fractionation scheme was modified to give a greater yield of the intermediate fraction (8. 3 wt %) but the melting properties of this intermediate fraction were less similar to those of cocoa butter. This latter fractionation scheme was scaled up (from 20 g tallow to 200 g and 1 kg). On each scale an intermediate fraction with consistent yield and melting properties was obtained. The yields of the other two fractions varied, however, and overall there was a considerable difference in the behaviour of the fractionations on each scale. Attempts on the 1 kg scale to produce an intermediate fraction with properties similar to those of the best 20 g intermediate fraction (i. e. similar to cocoa butter) were unsuccessful. The highest proportion of the important 2 -oleo disaturated triglycerides attained in a 1 kg scale intermediate fraction was 36. 8 %, and this fraction melted, over a wider temperature range than cocoa butter. This intermediate fraction may be useful as a cocoa butter substitute in a coating chocolate, but is unlikely to be able to replace cocoa butter in chocolate. The hard fraction produced from this 1 kg fractionation (23. 0 wt % of the tallow) showed promise in a baking shortening blend with butter, but was too hard to be useful as a pastry shortening. The soft fraction performed well as a deep-frying medium and in mayonnaise...|$|R
40|$|The Island of Montserrat lies {{towards the}} {{northern}} end of the Lesser Antilles. It is made up of the products of five major and three smaller, parasitic volcanic centres. The four oldest volcanoes occur in the northern half of the island. Products of these volcanoes include andesitic lavas and pyroclastics but {{there is a lack of}} unreworked fragmental deposits and primary volcanic structures so that it is difficult to reconstruct the volcanic history of these centres. It appears however that the Harris-Bugby Centre, where a two-pyroxene andesite lava gave a K-Ar of 4. 1 m. y. is the oldest volcano on Montserrat. Silver Hill where a late-stage (?) lava has a K-Ar age of 1. 5 m. y. is older than the Centre Hills and Carabald Hill should probably be regarded as a parasitic centre of the Centre Hills in view of the similarity of the products and state of erosion of the two volcanoes. The oldest volcano in the south of Montserrat is South Soufriere Hill, where eruptions may have begun as much as 1. 6 m. y. ago. The products of this volcano include basaltic lava flows and a well-exposed sequence of andesitic and basaltic pyroclast falls, known as the White River Pyroclast Fall Series. Ultrabasic cumulate blocks occur within an andesite block fall of the White River Pyroclast Fall Series. It is thought that the lava flows and pyroclast falls built up a cone-shaped strato-volcano with a large central crater. Late in the history of Smith Soufriere Hill two basic domes were extruded within the crater and their extrusion destroyed most of the crater wall and much of the eastern flank of the strato-volcano. The intrusion at Roche's of a body of basic two-pyroxene andesite of similar composition to the domes at South Soufriere Hill may also have occurred about this time. Among deposits disturbed by this intrusion are a group of tuffaceous limestones which on palaeontological grounds are thought to be about 40, 000 yrs. old. Because of the compositional similarity of the Roche's Intrusion and the South Soufriere Hill domes and because the intrusion has affected deposits which are similar to South Soufriere Hill pyroclast falls the Roche's Centre is probably a subsidiary centre of South Soufriere Hill. The earliest events at the Soufriere Hills included the extrusion of of two-pyroxene andesite and associated pyroclast flow eruptions. These were followed by the extrusion of at least two domes of hornblende-hypersthene andesite and charcoal from a pyroclast flow believed to have been associated with one of these domes gave an age of 23, 568 andplusmn; 786 yrs. St. George's Hill which erupted large quantities of hornblende-hypersthene andesite pumice falls may have been active as a subsidiary centre on the north west flank of the Soufriere Hills about this time. Sometime after the extrusion of the hornblende-hypersthene andesite domes violent pumice flow eruptions gave rise to the formation of English's Crater. Charcoal from one of the pumice flows has given an age of 18, 390 andplusmn; 360 yrs. Late stage events at the Soufriere Hills include the extrusion of the Castle Peak hornblende-hypersthene andesite dome within the crater and this may be related to the breaching of the east wall of the crater. Minor eruptions of pyroclast flows and pyroclast falls have occurred since the formation of Castle Peak and charcoal from the most recent of these has been dated at A. D. 1646 ± 54 yrs. Although there have been no recorded eruptions at the Soufriere Hills solfataric activity has been continuous in historic time and three periods of unusually intense seismic and solfataric activity have occurred within the last 70 years. An estimate of the relative volumes of rock types on Montserrat shows that andesite (96. 5 %) greatly predominates over basalt (3. 3 %) and dacite (0. 2 %). Basalts occur only at South Soufriere Hill where they account for about 35 % of the total volume. South Soufriere Hill with its ultrabasic cumulates, basalts, basaltic andesites and andesites resembles Mt. Misery, St. Kitts or the Soufriere, St. Vincent. The other Montserratian volcanoes and most volcanoes in the Lesser Antilles have erupted nothing but andesite. The Montserrat basalts and andesites have many petrographical features in common with other calc-alkaline lavas. Plagioclase which is the most abundant phenocryst mineral has highly calcic cores (~An 85) which may reflect initial <b>crystallisation</b> under high <b>water</b> vapour pressures. Olivine (~Fo 75) was apparently the first phenocryst to form in the basalts. There is some evidence of a reaction relation between u and liquid to produce hypersthene but olivine is more often surrounded by clinopyroxene coronas than by hypersthene rims. Magnetite which is more abundant in the basalts than the andesites may also have been an early phase to separate. Pyroxene phenocrysts in the basalts and andesites show complex interrelationships. There is, however, no evidence to suggest a reaction relationship between augite and liquid to give hypersthene. Instead clinopyroxene probably reacts with liquid to give hornblende, which will account for the antipathetic relationship between these minerals in the Montserrat lavas. Microphenocrysts in the lavas have different compositions and properties to the phenocrysts and are believed to have crystallised at higher levels in the crust probably close to the surface. Phenocrysts which initially formed deeper in the crust may undergo additional crystallisation at this stage. A notable feature of the groundmasses of the Montserrat lavas is the abundance of tridymite and cristobalite, which appear to have crystallised at a very late stage, perhaps from fluids tripped in lavas at the time of their eruption. A few lavas contain quartz rich mica-bearing aggregates which have a similar mode of occurrence to tridymite and cristobalite in the other rocks. The mica is probably phlogopite. Disequilibrium petrographic features are common in the Montserrat lavas. Lowering of water vapour pressure may account for the resorption of quartz, hornblende and calcic plagioclase at shallow depths. Oscillatory zoning in plagioclase might reflect small fluctuations in water vapour pressure but is probably best explained in terms of a diffusion-supersaturation theory. Four groups of xenoliths were recognised on Montserrat. Ultrabasic cumulates composed of unzoned crystals of sodic anorthite (~An 90), aluminous amphibole, olivine (~Fo 75) and magnetite occur within andesitic pyroclastics of the White River Pyroclast Fall Series. They have probably formed by the crystallisation of basaltic magma under high water vapour pressures at depths of ? 6 andndash; 8 km. Rare doleritic blocks also occur in andesitic horizons of the White River Pyroclast Fall Series. Cognate xenoliths of basaltic composition are found in andesitic lavas and represent accumulations of minerals which occur as microphenocrysts in the host rock together with a few "older" phenocrysts. Metasedimentary and metavolcanic blocks were also found on Montserrat. Forty-five new major element analyses together with new determinations of 13 trace elements in 13 rocks and Sr 87 / 86 ratios in 7 rocks are presented along with some older analytical data. These data suggest that the Montserrat lavas form a closely related series of rocks. The rocks of South Soufriere Hill however, differ from those of the other Montserratian volcanoes in that their SiO 2 range is larger and the South Soufriere Hill andesites are slightly depleted in total iron, MgO, TiO 2 and V and slightly enriched in Na 2 O and Al 2 O 3 relative to andesites from the other volcanoes. Petrochemically, the Montserrat lavas resemble those from most of the other islands in the Lesser Antilles, especially St. Kitts. However they have less K 2 O, Rb, Ba and Cr and more Na 2 O, V, Co and Cu than lavas from St. Lucia and lower Sr 87 / 86 ratios and smaller amounts of radiogenic lead than lavas from St. Lucia and Dominica. The Montserrat lavas also bear an overall chemical resemblance to lavas from other calc-alkaline suites but they are somewhat depleted in TiO 2, Rb, Sr, Ba, Ni and Cr and enriched in Al 2 O 3 and CaO compared with most calc-alkaline lavas especially those from continental areas. Basalts from Montserrat contain slightly more K 2 O than most high alumina basalts but the Montserrat andesites are considerably depleted in K 2 O relative to most andesites. The fundamental process in the petrogenesis of the Montserrat lavas is believed to involve the partial melting of oceanic tholeiite, or its metamorphosed equivalent along the Benioff Zone beneath the Lesser Antilles. Oceanic tholeiite is a suitable parent for the Montserrat and the Lesser Antillean lavas in terms of composition and availability. The only difficulty is that the Lesser Antillean lavas, particularly those from St. Lucia and Dominica are so enriched in the large and highly charged cation elements and radiogenic nuclides compared with oceanic tholeiite that an extra source for these appears to be required. Relatively small amounts of alkali basalt, oceanic sediment and detritus from South America or the Lesser Antilles may be carried into the upper mantle and melted with the oceanic tholeiite and these are possible sources of the "missing" elements and also of water. The composition of the magmas resulting from the melting of material along the Benioff Zone will vary depending on the physical conditions. Low temperatures and hydrous conditions will favour the production of andesitic liquids whereas dry melting and high temperatures will tend to produce basaltic liquids. As the arc evolves the tendency is probably towards wetter melting conditions as more material from the arc or more oceanic sediment does down the Benioff Zone. As the magmas generated along the Benioff Zone ascend to the surface they may be modified by a number of secondary processes. These include fractional crystallisation, wallrock reaction, assimilation and gas transfer. There is evidence in the Lesser Antillean rocks for at least two periods of fractional crystallisation. One of these occurs near the surface, at low pressures and probably has little fundamental petrogenetic effect. The other, which occurs deeper in the crust (? 6 andndash; 8 km.) involves the separation of sub-silicic aggregates from basaltic magma and is probably instrumental in producing andesites at certain volcanoes in the Lesser Antilles, like South Soufriere Hill, Montserrat and Soufriere, St. Vincent. The relative importance of the other "secondary" processes is rather difficult to assess. Wall rock reaction does not appear to be very important within the mantle but may occur within the crust. Gas transfer is likely to be quite important especially in water rich magmas and may be in some measure responsible for the erratic behaviour of certain elements notably K 2 O in the Lesser Antillean lavas. The compositional variation within the Lesser Antilles may to some extent reflect differences in the relative importance of different "secondary" petrogenetic processes at different places. The restriction of chemically "evolved" lavas to the islands of St. Lucia, Dominica. and ?Martinique in the central portion of the arc may, however reflect the fact that these islands are the oldest in the Lesser Antilles although their position relative to the direction of underthrusting of oceanic crust might also be important. </p...|$|R
40|$|Nicolas ARNDT, Jean-Yves COTTIN, Jean HERNANDEZ, Thierry JUTEAU, Philippe ROSSIThe {{study of}} hot-spot related magmas is {{essential}} for the understanding of the structure and the compositions of mantle plumes and their interactions with the oceanic lithosphere. Until the early 1990 's, the geological knowledge of the Marquesas Islands was based on exploratory field studies. Thus, geochemical modellings of the Marquesan plume published between 1986 and 1993 were only supported by very partial sampling. These modellings have strongly underestimated the interactions between plume-derived magmas and the oceanic lithosphere and did not adress the complex origins of evolved lavas (trachytes and phonolites), which are sometimes very abundant in the Marquesas. Since 1995, more focused studies have shown that geochemical trends can vary considerably from one island to the other, reflecting the small scale heterogeneity of the plume together with complex lithosphere-asthenosphere interactions. The mapping programme of the Central Marquesas islands (Nuku Hiva, Ua Huka and Ua Pou) initiated by the French BRGM in 2000 has allowed their structural study together with a detailed sampling which we have used for petrologic and geochemical investigations. The Marquesas archipelago lies on an oceanic crust formed between 53 and 49 Ma at the Pacific-Farallon spreading centre and later strongly thickened beneath {{the central part of the}} archipelago where the Moho reaches depths of 15 to 20 km. Thermal models allow to test the hypothesis of rapid emplacement of a thick mafic root underplated during recent (5. 8 - 0. 4 Ma) surface hotspot magmatism. The predicted thermal subsidence declines rapidly within the first three million years, from 250 m/m. y. to 50 m/m. y. Marine terraces throughout the Marquesas are exposed at + 2 m elevation and are attributed to the last interglacial highstand at 125 ka. No differential subsidence is observed between the oldest and the youngest islands. These observations are inconsistent with thermal subsidence following a recent underplating event and support rather the hypothesis of an older thickening of the Marquesas crust due to the edification of a near-axis plateau. Ua Pou is long known for its exceptionally abundant phonolites. Our first systematic sampling of this volcanic island leads to the estimation of its emerged volume to 27. 5 km 3 including 18 km 3 of phonolites (65 %) which were emplaced during two distinct stages, 2 km 3 of other intermediate and evolved lavas (8 %) and 4. 5 km 3 of mafic lavas (27 %). Ua Pou island displays an alkaline series ranging from basanites to phonolites with a marked bimodal distribution together with a Daly gap evidenced by the lack of phonotephrites. Major and trace element data coupled with Sr-Nd-Pb isotope analyses and K-Ar ages allow to discuss the complex petrogenetic history of Ua Pou. At ca. 4 Ma, the partial melting of a mantle plume displaying a young HIMU signature produces the Ua Pou tholeiites. Magmatic activity resumes at ca. 2. 9 Ma when melting of an heterogeneous mantle with a prominent EM II + HIMU signature source produces primitive basaltic melts. Those melts are either emplaced at depth or at the surface, or evolve by fractional crystallisation towards tephrites. During the same stage, re-melting at depth of this basanitic material produces tephriphonolitic magmas, leaving an amphibole-rich residuum. These magmas evolve by closed system fractional crystallisation towards phonolitic liquids, which can undergone contamination by seawater. Whereas the emplacement of these two phonolitic types is still operating, more or less concomitantly with the production of basanitic magmas, additional open system processes are involved between 2. 6 et 2. 4 Ma. They lead either to tephriphonolites and phonolites contaminated by plagiogranitic-type materials with an HIMU signature or to phonolites by extreme fractionation coupled with assimilation of oceanic crust materials with a DMM signature. Ua Pou island can thus be regarded as an unusual example of an intraoceanic suite in which the prominence of evolved lavas reflects their origin from partial melting of mafic precursors followed by crustal contamination rather than from fractional crystallisation. Nuku Hiva island is composed of two nested volcanoes : the external shield volcano (Tekao volcano) formed by olivine tholeiites and the inner volcano of Taiohae showing an almost continuous alkaline series ranging from basalts to trachytes. Mafic Taiohae lavas derive from a mantle source more enriched than that of the shield volcano tholeiites, affected by time-decreasing melting rates. Intermediate lavas (hawaiites and mugearites) of the inner Taiohae volcano derive from the basalts through fractional <b>crystallisation</b> under high <b>water</b> pressure, dominated by the fractionation of amphibole (up to 25 % of the cumulate). The origin of evolved lavas (benmoreites and trachytes) is constrained by their isotopic signature which is strongly different from that of basaltic-intermediate lavas of the Taiohae volcano. Their origin can be ascribed either to 1) assimilation of oceanic material with a strong EM II signature coupled with fractional crystallisation, or to 2) partial melting at depth of mafic precursors not found at the surface of the island. In Nuku Hiva island intraoceanic suite, magmatic evolution is thus mainly controlled by fractional crystallisation processes under high water pressure, while the origin of evolved lavas evidences complex lithosphere-asthenosphere interactions. Our preferred plume-hotspot model accounting for the Marquesas geochemical heterogeneity is that of a very heterogeneous plume containing randomly distributed small-sized domains with either a subducted oceanic crust signature (HIMU) and a terrigeneous sediment signature (EM II). The DMM signature of the Marquesas magmas would be acquired in a later stage and might either reflect the melting of the base of the oceanic lithosphere above the plume, or interactions between the ascending plume-derived magmas and this lithosphere. Variations of partial melting rates and the interaction between basaltic liquids and the oceanic crust within intracrustal reservoirs can also account for the magmatic heterogeneity within a single island. Although these effects are not documented for the whole set of Marquesas islands, most of the geochemical heterogeneity of their lavas is likely to reflect the mixing in various proportions of EM II, HIMU and DMM source endmembers. Postulating that the plume only contains the EM II and HIMU components and that DMM is the unique component of the oceanic lithosphere, a mixing model between these three components allows to estimate 1) the proportions of each end-member in the plume-derived liquids and 2) the mixing pattern between these liquids and the oceanic lithosphere, leading to estimate the interactions between the plume and the oceanic lithosphere. The DMM contribution appears dominant for the islands of Eiao, Nuku Hiva, Ua Huka and Hiva Oa. That of EM II is dominant for the akaline lavas of Ua Pou and that of HIMU for Fatu Hiva and Ua Pou tholeiites. For most of the Marquesas islands but the two latters ones, the contribution of DMM is quite important, a feature which may indicate either 1) that the DMM end-member is present within the plume, and/or 2) that assimilation of depleted DMM material modifies considerably the composition of the plume liquids. This last hypothesis is consistent with the existence of an oceanic plateau in the Marquesan substratum, the rocks of which having a prominent DMM signature would interact with the plume-derived magmas. L'étude des magmas issus des points chauds est essentielle pour la compréhension de la structure et de la composition des panaches mantelliques et de leurs interactions avec la lithosphère océanique. Jusqu'au début des années 1990, les données sur les îles Marquises ne provenaient que de missions exploratoires. De ce fait, les modèles géochimiques de fonctionnement du point chaud marquisien publiés de 1986 à 1993 ne reposaient que sur un échantillonnage très partiel. Ils ont fortement sous-estimé les interactions entre les magmas issus du point chaud et la lithosphère océanique et négligé la complexité de l'origine des laves évoluées (trachytes et phonolites), parfois très abondantes. Depuis 1995, des études ponctuelles plus précises ont montré que l'évolution géochimique des laves au cours du temps variait considérablement d'une île à l'autre, reflétant l'hétérogénéité à petite échelle du panache ainsi que des interactions lithosphère – asthénosphère complexes. Le programme de cartographie des îles du groupe central des Marquises (Nuku Hiva, Ua Huka, Ua Pou) a été initié par le Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM) en 2000. Il a permis l'étude de leurs structures, ainsi qu'un échantillonnage détaillé que nous avons exploité du point de vue pétrologique et géochimique. L'archipel des Marquises repose sur une croûte océanique formée à l'axe de la dorsale Pacifique-Farallon entre 53 et 49 Ma et fortement épaissie sous la partie centrale de l'archipel où le Moho atteint des profondeurs de 15 à 20 km. L'application d'un modèle thermique permet de tester l'hypothèse d'une mise en place rapide d'un épais sous-placage mafique contemporain du volcanisme de point chaud récent exprimé en surface (5, 8 - 0, 4 Ma). La subsidence thermique prédite par ce modèle diminue rapidement pendant les trois premiers millions d'années, depuis 250 à 50 m/Ma. Or, des terrasses d'abrasion marine, dont l'origine est attribuée au dernier haut niveau marin interglaciaire daté à 125 ka, bordent toutes les îles des Marquises à 2 m d'altitude. Aucune différence de subsidence n'est observée entre les îles les plus anciennes et celles les plus récentes. Ces observations ne sont pas en accord avec le modèle de subsidence thermique postérieure à un événement de sous-placage|$|R
