5|$|The {{teeth of}} Patagosaurus are {{reminiscent}} of more derived sauropods. They are similar in morphology to Euhelopus, being concave on one side as well as having crowns with fairly great expansions. They are also similar to Camarasaurus, although the latter genus has less of a <b>concavity</b> and expansion. The teeth also possess marginal denticles on the crown. Based on histological studies, an individual of Patagosaurus would have replaced all its teeth within 58 days, similar to 62 days for Camarasaurus, and 34 days for Diplodocus.|$|E
5|$|In K. guimarotae, the {{two halves}} of the dentary diverge from each other at an angle of 20° near the front, then 40° near the back. It also bears two convexities {{on the bottom of the}} jaw, one at the third and fourth teeth and another at the eighth to tenth teeth. The latter {{convexity}} is replaced by a <b>concavity</b> in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the top margin of the jaw behind the tooth row slopes upwards in a straight line. The side of the dentary is pitted, albeit much more densely so in K. langenbergensis. Near the back of the dentary in both species, the pits are replaced by longitudinal grooves. On the interior of the jaw, the splenial bears an oval foramen behind the level of the symphysis in both species, and the top of the bone bears a low and roughened crest in K. guimarotae.|$|E
5|$|Past {{hypotheses}} {{have suggested}} mistakenly that the Golondrina was a descendant or {{variant of the}} Plainview type. Although the two points exhibit similarities, particularly in terms of shape, they are now recognized as separate types. Identification is made {{from a lack of}} an auriculated, fishtail base on the Plainview and a deeper basal <b>concavity</b> on the Golondrina. Plainview points may have served to bring down large bison, while Golondrina points may have been used for killing smaller game such as deer, as well as doubling as a butchering knife. Compared to the split-stem hafting style of the Golondrina point without a deep setting, the shape of the Plainview points would necessitate them being set relatively deeply into a socketed haft that once bound would leave less of the cutting edge exposed. Stratigraphic evidence from the St. Mary's Hall site in southern, central Texas implies that Golondrina may have superseded Plainview on the southern Plains.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a new method for {{recognizing}} planar objects by matching multiple <b>concavities</b> of object boundaries in a projective invariant manner. Object boundaries are first decomposed into several <b>concavities</b> using bitangents and obtained <b>concavities</b> are then sorted. Corresponding <b>concavities</b> are aligned by using the projective matrix computed from their bitangent and tangent points. Best <b>concavities</b> are selected based on the Hausdorff distance between aligned <b>concavities.</b> This subset of <b>concavities</b> is then used to align original and transformed objects. Closeness of two aligned objects is checked by the same distance metric. Proposed method is verified by several experiments...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{objects are}} {{effortlessly}} recognized from their outlines, largely irrespective of viewpoint. Previous studies have drawn different conclusions regarding the importance to shape recognition of specific shape {{features such as}} convexities and <b>concavities.</b> However, most studies employed familiar objects, or shapes without curves, and did not measure shape recognition across changes in scale and position. We present a novel set of random shapes with well-defined convexities, <b>concavities</b> and inflections (intermediate points), segmented to isolate each feature type. Observers matched the segmented reference shapes {{to one of two}} subsequently presented whole-contour shapes (target or distractor) that were re-scaled and re-positioned. For very short segment lengths, performance was significantly higher for convexities than for <b>concavities</b> or intermediate points and for convexities remained constant with increasing segment length. For <b>concavities</b> and intermediate points, performance improved with increasing segment length, reaching convexity performance only for long segments. No significant differences between <b>concavities</b> and intermediates were found. These results show {{for the first time that}} closed curvilinear shapes are encoded using the positions of convexities, rather than <b>concavities</b> or intermediate regions. A shape-template model with no free parameters gave an excellent account of the data...|$|R

5|$|Viewed {{from the}} top, the parietal {{increases}} in width at the back; {{the increase is}} small in K. langenbergensis, such that the bone is overall rectangular, but the difference is larger in K. guimarotae. The back of the bone bears a small notch in K. langenbergensis and a general <b>concavity</b> in K. guimarotae that slightly exposes the underlying supraoccipital. The postorbital bears two branches that join with a gentle curve, separated by an angle of 130° in K. langenbergensis. The supratemporal fenestra is roughly square in K. guimarotae but has a thinner back end in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the maximum distance between the supratemporal fenestrae is {{about a third of}} the total width of the top of the skull. The trapezoidal infratemporal fenestra is 1.5 times as long as it is wide in K. langenbergensis.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} Portuguese dogfish {{is thick}} and {{cylindrical}} except for the flattened belly. The two dorsal fins are small and of similar size and shape, each bearing a tiny grooved spine in front. The first dorsal fin originates well behind the pectoral fins, while the second dorsal originates over {{the middle of the}} pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are medium-sized with a rounded margin. There is no anal fin. The caudal fin has a short but well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The very large dermal denticles change in shape with age: in juveniles, they are widely spaced and heart-shaped with an incomplete midline ridge and three posterior points, while in adults they are overlapping, roughly circular, smooth, and flattened with a round central <b>concavity,</b> superficially resembling the scales of bony fishes. Young sharks are a uniform blue-black in color, while adults are brown-black; there are no prominent fin markings. In 1997, a partially albino individual, with a pale body but normal eyes, was caught in the northeastern Atlantic. This represented the first documented case of albinism in a deep-sea shark.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the reticulate whipray is diamond-shaped and wider than long, with the leading margins almost straight and the snout and outer corners angular. In juveniles, the disc {{is about as}} wide as long, with a more obtuse snout and rounded corners. The eyes are small and immediately followed by the spiracles (paired respiratory openings). A short and wide curtain of skin with a minutely fringed rear margin is present between the long, thin nostrils. The mouth is relatively small, with a deep <b>concavity</b> {{at the center of}} the lower jaw and shallow furrows at the corners extending onto the lower jaw. A row of 4–5 papillae (nipple-like structures) is found across the floor of the mouth. There are 26–40 upper tooth rows and 27–44 lower tooth rows. The pelvic fins are small and triangular. The tail is whip-like and extremely thin, measuring 3–3.5 times as long as the disc when intact, and lacks fin folds. Usually one serrated stinging spine is located on the upper surface on the tail, some distance from the base.|$|E

In this paper, we present a snake-based scheme for efficiently detecting contours of objects with boundary <b>concavities.</b> The proposed method is composed of two steps.

Second, snake points are optimized by inserting new points and deleting unnecessary points to better describe the object's boundary. The proposed algorithm can successfully extract objects with boundary <b>concavities,</b> and is insensitive {{to the number of}} initial snake points. Experimental results have shown that our algorithm produces more accurate segmentation results than the conventional algorithm. 1...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Root grooves are {{considered}} {{a risk factor for}} periodontal disease. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure the length of the root of lower central incisors (LCI), as well as the width and depth of the <b>concavities</b> of their proximal surfaces. Material and methods: The width and depth of root <b>concavities,</b> as well as root length, were evaluated in 90 LCI. All teeth were measured using a digital contour measuring instrument (Contracer®) for the root grooves and a digital calliper for evaluating root length. Results:After statistical analysis (t- Student and Kruskal-Wallis Anova tests, p< 0. 05) it was possible to confirm: the mean root length on its distal surface (13. 88 ± 1. 47 mm) and on its mesial surface (13. 88 ± 1. 47 mm) and on its mesial surface (13. 76 ± 1. 50 mm). <b>Concavities</b> were present in 100 % of the samples; <b>concavities</b> were found 2 mm, coronally from the CEJ, at the CEJ, and at all root surface. The <b>concavities</b> were wider than deeper; on the mesial surface, the greatest width was 1. 717 mm and the greatest depth was 0. 118 mm. Conclusion: The distal surface of the lower central incisor is the longest. The root <b>concavities</b> on the proximal surfaces are present in 100 %; the greatest width and depth was at 6 mm apically from the CEJ at both sides, which corresponds to the root middle third.

40|$|Empirical work on visual {{aesthetics}} {{has found}} a strong preference for smooth curvature. The use of different tasks and exposures can clarify whether such a preference reflects immediate visual responses or higher cognitive processes, such as semantic associations. In three experiments, we used abstract irregular shapes and manipulated the contour (polygons vs. smoothed versions of polygons) but matched the stimuli for number of protrusions (vertices or curvature extrema) and number of <b>concavities.</b> In Experiment 1, shapes were presented for 120 ms, and observers produced a two-alternative forced-choice response (like or dislike). In Experiments 2 and 3, we used rating scales measuring liking and attractiveness, respectively, and the stimuli were presented until a response was made. Overall, smooth curved contours were preferred over angular contours, especially with immediate responses (Experiment 1). Moreover, shapes were preferred when they contained a balance between number of vertices and <b>concavities</b> (i. e., a lower proportion of <b>concavities</b> for {{a large number of}} vertices). However, a preference for shapes with the highest number of vertices and the least number of <b>concavities</b> occurred in the two-alternative forced-choice task (Experiment 1). In contrast, the reverse combination (i. e., star-like shapes) emerged with rating scales (Experiments 2 and 3). We conclude that the curvature effect is stable across tasks, although it is modulated subtly by some parametric variations (vertices and <b>concavities)</b> related to visual complexity...|$|R

The results show that <b>concavities</b> did not benefit from the same global object-based attention or holistic shape encoding as convexities and that the participants relied on separable spatial dimensions to judge figural shape in <b>concavities.</b> <b>Concavities</b> may exploit a secondary process for shape perception that allows regions composed of perceptually independent features to ultimately be perceived as gestalts...|$|R
