Absence of CUS 2 renders certain U 2 RNA folding mutants lethal, arguing that a normal activity of CUS 2 is to help refold U 2 into a structure favorable for its binding to SF 3 b and SF 3 a prior to spliceosome assembly. Both CUS 2 function in vivo and the in vitro RNA binding activity of CUS 2 are disrupted by mutation of the first RRM, suggesting that rescue of misfolded U 2 involves the direct binding of CUS 2. Human Tat-SF 1, reported to stimulate Tat-specific, transactivating region-dependent human immunodeficiency virus transcription in vitro, is structurally similar to CUS 2. Anti-Tat-SF 1 antibodies coimmunoprecipitate SF 3 a 66 (SAP 62), the human homolog of PRP 11, suggesting that Tat-SF 1 has a parallel function in splicing in human cells.

Here, we solved the solution structure of the RRM 1 of human SF 3 b 49 and examined its mode of interaction with a fragment of human SF 3 b 145 using NMR methods. Chemical shift mapping showed that the SF 3 b 145 fragment spanning residues 598 - 631 interacts with SF 3 b 49 RRM 1, which adopts a canonical RRM fold with a topology of β 1 -α 1 -β 2 -β 3 -α 2 -β 4. Furthermore, a docking model based on NOESY measurements suggests that residues 607 - 616 of the SF 3 b 145 fragment adopt a helical structure that binds to RRM 1 predominantly via α 1, consequently exhibiting a helix-helix interaction in almost antiparallel. This mode of interaction was confirmed by a mutational analysis using GST pull-down assays. Comparison with structures of all RRM domains when complexed with a peptide found that this helix-helix interaction is unique to SF 3 b 49 RRM 1.

Loss of CUS 2 does not bypass the role of PRP 5, an RNA helicase family member required for ATP-dependent prespliceosome formation. Genetic interactions between CUS 2 and a heat-sensitive prp 5 allele parallel those observed between CUS 2 and U 2, and suggest that CUS 2 mediates functional interactions between U 2 RNA and PRP 5.

U 2 snRNPs depleted of Rds 3 p fail to form stable prespliceosomes, although U 2 snRNA stability is not affected.

In this work we describe a mutagenesis approach aimed at characterizing the ci heme and its interaction with the Qi site environment. We engineered a mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in which Phe 40 from subunit IV was substituted by a tyrosine. This results in a dramatic slowing down of the reoxidation of the b hemes under single flash excitation, suggesting hindered accessibility of the heme to its quinone substrate. This modified accessibility likely originates from the ligation of the heme iron by the phenol(ate) side chain introduced by the mutation. Indeed, it also results in a marked downshift of the ci heme midpoint potential (from + 100 mV to − 200 mV at pH 7). Yet the overall turnover rate of the mutant cytochrome b 6 f complex under continuous illumination was found similar to the wild type one, both in vitro and in vivo.

Addition of recombinant Cus 2 p can restore the ATIP dependence of prespliceosome assembly, but only if it is added before Prp 5 p. Prp 5 p with an altered ATP-binding domain (Prp 5 -GNTp) can support growth in vivo, but only in a cus 2 deletion strain, mirroring the in vitro results. Other Prp 5 ATP-binding domain substitutions are lethal, even in the cus 2 deletion strain, but can be suppressed by U 2 small nuclear RNA mutations that hyper-stabilize U 2 stem IIa. We infer that the presence of Cus 2 p and stem IIa-destabilized forms of U 2 small nuclear RNA places high demands on the ATP-driven function of Prp 5 p.

The positive role of Cus 2 p in rescuing mutant U 2 can be reconciled with its antagonistic effect on Prp 5 function in a model whereby Cus 2 p first helps Prp 5 p to activate the U 2 snRNP for prespliceosome formation but then is displaced by Prp 5 p before or during the stabilization of U 2 at the branchpoint...|$|R
40|$|Interferons {{comprise}} {{a class of}} structurally related proteins which exert several regulatory effects in responsive cells. These effects include {{the establishment of an}} antiviral state, the inhibition of cellular proliferation and the alteration of different immune reactions. In particular, the IFN:s rapidly augment the lytic activity of the natural killer (NK) cells. In the present thesis, some of the functional and molecular mechanisms by which IFN:s act on NK cells and other leucocytes are studied. A good correlation is found between the ability of different tumor cell lines to induce IFN production among peripheral blood lymphocytes and their sensitivity to NK cell cytotoxicity, indicating that IFN might regulate the activity of NK cells through a positive feed-back mechanism. When studying the interaction between the NK cells and two target cell lines it is demonstrated that the two cell lines are not recognized by the same receptors. The augmentation of NK cell cytotoxicity by IFN is shown to involve both alteration of receptor structures on the NK cell and enhancement of steps in their lytic machinery. The effects of IFN on the synthesis of individual proteins is then studied by two-dimensional electrophoresis. It is demonstrated that IFN-a and IFN-ß within 1. 5 hours induce the synthesis of nine proteins (Mf 80, 75, 62, 58, 53, 38, 36, 33 and 30 kD) in human lymphocytes. Tne induction is dependent on a rapid de novo RNA synthesis, which is initiated less than 30 minutes after the addition of IFN. The expression of the nine proteins is well correlated to the development of augmented NK cell cytotoxicity. Four of the proteins (Mr 80, 62, 38 and 33 kD) are found to be expressed in a panel of ten hematopoetic and two anchorage-dependent cell lines, whereas the remaining proteins seem to be expressed in leucocytes only. IFN induce the synthesis of the same proteins in both purified large granular lymphocytes (responsible for the main NK cell activity in man), T cells and monocytes, demonstrating that the augmentation of NK cell activity does not involve the formation of unique 1 NK-cel 11 specific proteins. Rather, the augmentation of the lytic activity of both NK cells, cytotoxic T cells and monocytes seem to involve common stages in their lytic mechanisms. In contrast to IFN-a and IFN-ß, IFN-y, does not induce any detectable proteins in either NK cells or T cells. This lack of effect of IFN-y on the protein synthesis is not a general phenomenon, since the effects of IFN-a and IFN-y are similar 1 n a glioma cell line. These results demonstrate that there exists at least one pathway to augment the NK cell cytotoxicity which does not involve the increased synthesis of the nine IFN-a/IFN-ß inducible proteins and indicates that either these proteins are mainly involved in other effects of IFN, or that the augmentation by IFN-a/IFN-ß and IFN-y involve different pathways. When the effects of IFN-a on the synthesis of membrane-associated proteins is studied, it is demonstrated that only the 80 kD IFN-a inducible protein is associated with the cell membrane.

The pET 15 b constructs were expressed and assayed for ATPase, ATP binding (only those proteins that were ATPase activity deficient) and RNA binding activities. The pET 11 a constructs were expressed and assayed for ATP binding (only those proteins that were ATPase activity deficient) and RNA binding activities. Experiments on the bacterially-expressed <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> and its mutants showed that (1) the non-domain N-terminal regions of the <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> (sequences up to domain I) are dispensable for both ATPase activity and RNA binding, (2) that domain I is necessary for ATP binding and ATPase activity, but it alone is not sufficient for ATPase activity, (3) that domains lA and VI are both RNA binding domains and that the presence of one or the other is sufficient for RNA binding. In addition this study showed that the <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> expressed in virus-infected plants is glycosylated and tyrosine-phosphorylated. This observation is important since it leads to speculations that the <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> may have roles in signal transduction, membrane transport and other biological functions...|$|E
40|$|Most {{positive}} strand RNA viruses infecting {{plants and}} animals encode proteins containing the so-called nucleotide binding motif (NTBM) (1) in their amino acid sequences (2). As suggested from {{the high level of}} sequence similarity of these viral proteins with the recently described superfamilies of helicase-like proteins (3 - 5), the NTBM-containing cylindrical inclusion (<b>CI)</b> <b>protein</b> from plum pox virus (PPV), which belongs to the potyvirus group of positive strand RNA viruses, is shown to be able to unwind RNA duplexes. This activity was found to be dependent on the hydrolysis of NTP to NDP and Pi, and thus it can be considered as an RNA helicase activity. In the in vitro assay used, the PPV <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> was only able to unwind double strand RNA substrates with 3 ' single strand overhangs. This result indicates that the helicase activity of the PPV <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> functions in the 3 ' to 5 ' direction (6). To our knowledge, this is the first report on a helicase activity associated with a protein encoded by an RNA virus...|$|E
40|$|The plum pox potyvirus (PPV) protein CI is an RNA helicase whose {{function}} in the viral life cycle is still unknown. The <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> contains seven conserved sequence motifs typical of RNA helicases of the superfamily SF 2. We have introduced several individual point mutations into the region coding for motif V of the PPV <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> and expressed these proteins in Escherichia coli as maltose binding protein fusions. Mutations that abolished RNA helicase activity also disturbed NTP hydrolysis. No mutations affected the RNA binding capacity of the <b>CI</b> <b>protein.</b> These mutations were also introduced in the PPV genome making use of a full-length cDNA clone. Mutant viruses carrying CI proteins with reduced RNA helicase activity replicated very poorly in protoplasts and were unable to infect whole plants without rapid pseudoreversion to wild-type. These results indicate that motif V {{is involved in the}} NTP hydrolysis step required for potyvirus RNA helicase activity, and that this activity plays an essential role in virus RNA replication inside the infected cell...|$|E
40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología Molecular, Fecha de lectura 31 - 03 - 2004 Potyviruses are positive-strand RNA {{viruses that}} encode nine or more mature proteins fmm a polyprotein expression strategy. One unique {{feature of the}} potyvims infection is the accumulation of characteristic pinwheel-shaped cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. The plum pox potyvirus (PPV) protein CI is an RNA helicase which is involved in replication and cell to cell spread of the virus. However, relationships among the enzymatic activities, assembly in inclusion bodies, and CI functions in the viral cycle, are not well established. The <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> contains seven conserved sequence motifs Srpical of RNA helicases of the superfamily SF 2. There is great controversy about {{the function of the}} VI motif in the enzymatic activity of the protein. We have introduced several individual point mutations into the sequence that coda for the motif VI of the PPV <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> and we have expressed these mutant proteins in Escherichia coli as maltose binding protein fusion products. Our results seem to indicate that this motif is implicated in the direct interaction with the NTP instead that with the nucleic acid interaction. Moreover we also show that the protein exists in solution as a group of different aggregated forms and that the oligomerization of the protein is required for an efficient RNA helicase activity. Inhibition of the CI wild type RNA helicase activity by negative mutants of the protein, it gives a further evidence about the importance of oligomerization in the helicase of the protein. The systemic infection of the plant by viruses generally requires the virus {{to be able to move}} from cell to cell through plasmodesmata and to long distances through the phloem. Normally, the cell-to-cell movement requires specialized proteins w), which facilitate intra- and inter-cellular transport of the virus or nucleoprotein complexes. Several types of MP have been characterized: (i) Some viruses, such as tobacco mosaic virus and red clover necrotic mosaic virus, encode single dedicated MPs that modify plasmodesmata and facilitate transport of themselves and nucleic acids through the modified channel; (ii) Several families of viruses contain a set of movement genes called the triple gene block, which encodes three proteins that are proposed to function co-ordinately to transport genomes through plasmodesmata; (iii) Finally, some other groups of viruses encode MPs that form plasmodesmal associated tubules through which virus or transport complexes travel. In contrast to most other viruses, the potyviruses do not encode a dedicated MP. Rather, potyvinis movement involves vira 1 proteins that perform additional roles in the viral infection cycle. It is known that cellto- cell transport requires the assembly of competent capsid protein (CP), suggesting that intercellular transport involves Wion formation. At early times post-infection, the <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> is associated with cone-shaped structures anchored to the cell wall or with plasma membrane in close proximity to plasmodesmata. In addition to the <b>CI</b> <b>protein,</b> these plasmodesmal-associated structures contain CP and viral RNA. So these observations led to propose that the <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> could facilitate the cell-to-cell movement of the virus through direct interactions or modifications of plasmodesmata. Fially genetic analysis data demonstrated the involvement of the <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> of TEV in cell-tocell movement. Regardless of wether or not the helicase activity of the <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> is required or not for the cell-to-cell movement, in this study, we show strong evidence about an structural implication of the <b>CI</b> <b>protein</b> on the vira 1 cell-to-cell movement...|$|E
40|$|The {{secreted}} Drosophila Hedgehog (Hh) protein induces transcription {{of specific}} genes {{by an unknown}} mechanism that requires the serpentine transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) and the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (<b>Ci).</b> <b>Protein</b> kinase A (PKA) has been implicated in the mechanism of Hh signal transduction because it acts to repress Hh target genes in imaginal disc cells that express Ci. Changes in <b>Ci</b> <b>protein</b> levels, detected by an antibody that recognizes an epitope in the carboxy-terminal half of Ci, have been suggested to mediate {{the positive effects of}} Hh and the negative effects of PKA on Hh target gene expression in imaginal discs. Here we show that PKA inhibition, like Hh, leads to increased “carboxy-terminal” Ci staining and Hh target gene expression in embryos. In addition, we find that Hh and Smo can stimulate target gene expression at constant Ci levels and that increased PKA activity can induce ectopic Hh target gene expression in a manner that requires Smo and Ci activities but does not involve changes in <b>Ci</b> <b>protein</b> concentration. This suggests a branching pathway of Hh signal transduction downstream of Smo and that PKA exerts opposite effects on the two branches. Finally we show that Hh signaling in embryos does not depend on cAMP-dependent regulation of PKA activity...|$|E
