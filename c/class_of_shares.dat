40|$|The {{theme of}} this diploma thesis is "Contracting {{autonomy}} in construction <b>of</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> and its limits". Its aim is {{to answer the question}} to what extent is the contracting autonomy of shareholders limited, when it comes to construction <b>of</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares.</b> The answer is being found by means of a negative analysis that lists both statutory and case-law based limits that restrict that autonomy. It also presents legal consequences, from which suffer those <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> special <b>shares</b> that collide with the statutory provisions and the constructions of rights that are questionable or vague.

40|$|A value {{mapping for}} {{cooperative}} games with transferable utilities is a mapping that assigns to every game {{a set of}} vectors each representing a distribution of the payoffs. A value mapping is efficient if to every game it assigns a set of vectors which components all sum up to the worth that {{can be obtained by}} all players cooperating together. An approach to efficiently allocate the worth of the `grand coalition' is using share mappings which assign to every game a set <b>of</b> <b>share</b> vectors being vectors which components sum up to one. Every component <b>of</b> a <b>share</b> vector is the corresponding players' share in the total payoff that is to be distributed among the players.

40|$|For multivariate failure time data, {{we propose}} a new <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> gamma frailty models by {{imposing}} the Box-Cox transformation on the hazard function, {{and the product}} of the baseline hazard and the frailty. This novel <b>class</b> <b>of</b> models allows for a very broad range of shapes and relationships between the hazard and baseline hazard functions. It includes the well-known Cox gamma frailty model and a new additive gamma frailty model as two special cases. Due to the nonnegative hazard constraint, this shared gamma frailty model is computationally challenging in the Bayesian paradigm. The joint priors are constructed through a conditional-marginal specification, in which the conditional distribution is univariate, and it absorbs the nonlinear parameter constraints. The marginal part of the prior specification is free of constraints. The prior distributions allow us to easily compute the full conditionals needed for Gibbs sampling, while incorporating the constraints. This <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> gamma frailty models is illustrated with a real dataset. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
