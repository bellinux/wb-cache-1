5|$|This was {{the last}} of Whale's films to be {{produced}} under the Laemmle family. The studio was now bankrupt, and the Laemmles lost control to J. Cheever Cowdin, head of the Standard Capital Corporation, and <b>Charles</b> <b>R.</b> Rogers, who was installed in Junior Laemmle's old job.|$|E
5|$|As study {{caught up}} to the wealth of new {{material}} from western North America, and venues for depictions proliferated, dinosaurs gained in popularity. The paintings of <b>Charles</b> <b>R.</b> Knight were the first influential representations of these finds. Knight worked extensively with the American Museum of Natural History and its director, Henry Fairfield Osborn, who wanted to use dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals to promote his museum and his ideas on evolution.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being the}} focus of {{historical}} and paleontological books, the Bone Wars {{was the subject of}} the graphic novel Bone Sharps, Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards, by Jim Ottaviani. Bone Sharps is a work of historical fiction, as Ottaviani introduces the character of <b>Charles</b> <b>R.</b> Knight to Cope for plot purposes, and other events have been restructured.|$|E

5|$|A {{century of}} storms and snow have covered the cairn and tent, {{which are now}} encased in the Ross Ice Shelf as it inches towards the Ross Sea. In 2001 {{glaciologist}} <b>Charles</b> <b>R.</b> Bentley estimated that the tent with the bodies was under about 75feet (23m) of ice and about 30miles (48km) from {{the point where they}} died; he speculated that in about 275 years the bodies would reach the Ross Sea, and perhaps float away inside an iceberg.|$|E
5|$|<b>Charles</b> <b>R.</b> Forbes, the {{energetic}} {{director of the}} Veterans' Bureau, sought to consolidate control of veterans' hospitals and their construction in his bureau. At the start of Harding's presidency, this power was vested in the Treasury Department. The politically-powerful American Legion backed Forbes and denigrated those who opposed him, like Secretary Mellon, and in April 1922, Harding agreed to transfer control to the Veterans' Bureau. Forbes' main task was to ensure that new hospitals were built {{around the country to}} help the 300,000 wounded World War I veterans.|$|E

Shortly after becoming the head of USSOCOM, in 2004, {{he was involved in}} the aftermath of the Pat Tillman friendly fire incident which culminated when he testified before the congressional Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in 2007. Also during his tenure in command of USSOCOM he announced the creation of Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command in 2006. Brown retired in 2007 after leading USSOCOM through four years of the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|On October 9, 1939, {{following}} the death of Senator Logan, Chandler resigned as governor, elevating Lieutenant Governor Keen Johnson to the governorship; the following day, Johnson appointed Chandler to Logan's vacated seat in the Senate. In a subsequent special election to fill the remainder of the unexpired term, Chandler first defeated <b>Charles</b> <b>R.</b> Farnsley in the Democratic primary, then bested Republican Walter B. Smith by a vote of 561,151 to 401,812 in the November 5, 1940, general election. Although he never forgave President Roosevelt for backing Barkley in the 1938 senatorial primary, he generally supported his administration, although he opposed parts of the New Deal.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1914, Beebe's {{pheasant}} monograph {{was essentially}} complete in manuscript. While the text was written by Beebe, the illustrations were provided by several artists: Robert Bruce Horsfall, who had accompanied Beebe on the expedition, painted the environmental scenes for the illustrations' backgrounds, while the pheasants themselves were painted by other artists including George Edward Lodge, <b>Charles</b> <b>R.</b> Knight, and Louis Agassiz Fuertes. Due to the elaborate nature of the book's color artwork, no American publisher was considered capable of reproducing it. The publisher which Beebe chose for his work was George Witherby and Sons of London, {{as a result of}} their success publishing the artwork of John James Audubon. The reproduction of the illustrations themselves was to be handled by several companies in Germany and Austria. Reproductions of the illustrations were in the process of being printed when World War I began, holding up the completion of the project for the next four years.|$|E

5|$|Dracula's Daughter was {{the last}} in the first cycle of Universal Horror films that reached back into the 1920s. Publicly, Universal {{said it was because}} a British ban on horror films would cut too deeply into the revenue such films could generate. In truth, the cycle was {{suspended}} because, just before filming on Dracula's Daughter had wrapped, the Laemmle family had lost control of Universal. Because of cost overruns on a number of pictures, Junior Laemmle was forced to borrow $1,000,000 on November 1, 1935. The money came from J. Cheever Cowdin, head of the Standard Capital Corporation, and from <b>Charles</b> <b>R.</b> Rogers. When the loan was called in March of the following year, Universal was unable to repay it. Standard assumed control of the studio on March 4, 1936 and Rogers replaced Junior as head of production. Rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following the release of Dracula's Daughter to focus on fare like Deanna Durbin musicals. Universal would not return to the horror genre for three years, when it released Son of Frankenstein in 1939.|$|E
5|$|In their haste, Cope and Marsh did {{not always}} follow up on their discoveries (or, more commonly, those made by their subordinates). For example, after the {{discovery}} by Benjamin Mudge of the type specimen of Allosaurus in Colorado, Marsh elected to concentrate work in Wyoming; when work resumed at Garden Park in 1883, M. P. Felch found an almost complete Allosaurus and several partial skeletons. In addition, one of Cope's collectors, H. F. Hubbell, found a specimen in the Como Bluff area of Wyoming in 1879, but apparently did not mention its completeness, and Cope never unpacked it. Upon unpacking in 1903 (several years after Cope had died), it {{was found to be}} one of the most complete theropod specimens then known, and in 1908 the skeleton, now cataloged as AMNH 5753, was put on public view. This is the well-known mount poised over a partial Apatosaurus skeleton as if scavenging it, illustrated as such by <b>Charles</b> <b>R.</b> Knight. Although notable as the first free-standing mount of a theropod dinosaur, and often illustrated and photographed, it has never been scientifically described.|$|E
5|$|On August 4, 1864, after {{rumors of}} a {{conspiracy}} in Columbia County reached Harrisburg and Washington, D.C., a Captain Manville requested that 40 to 45 soldiers be sent to Columbia County to arrest the local deserters and draft evaders. Forty-eight soldiers arrived on August 13 at the Bloomsburg Fairgrounds in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, {{near the mouth of}} Fishing Creek. They brought two cannons and a battery of artillery. Two days later, 250 more soldiers arrived in Bloomsburg. Several prominent residents in the county, including United States Senator <b>Charles</b> <b>R.</b> Buckalew, assured the soldiers that there was no opposing armed force within the county. On August 16 Major General Darius Couch arrived to oversee the troops, and another group of soldiers arrived that same day. Colonel John Gosse Freeze delivered a message to the northern part of Columbia County, stating that any draft evaders who reported to Bloomsburg by August 20 would be pardoned. By August 21, there were a thousand soldiers in Columbia County, and they began marching up Fishing Creek to search for the alleged fort. That evening the soldiers made camp at Coleman's Grove near Benton, Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{concluded}} as {{the worst}} day for the United States Air Force in Vietnam since 2 December 1966, when they had lost five aircraft over the skies of North Vietnam in a single day. Consequently, the actions of 23 August became known as ‘Black Wednesday’ amongst U.S. pilots who participated in air operations over Hanoi on that particular day. The USAF officially confirmed the loss of three F-4D fighters during the raid against the Yen Vien rail yard, {{which resulted in the}} deaths of Weapon Systems Officers Captain Ronald N. Sittner (66-0238, 8th TFW) and First Lieutenant Charles Lane (66-00247, 8th TFW). Major <b>Charles</b> <b>R.</b> Tyler, Captain Larry E. Carrigan, Major Robert R. Sawhill and First Lieutenant Gerald L. Gerndt ejected safely from their aircraft, but they were captured alive and became prisoners of war. Major C.B. Demarque and his Weapons System Officer, First Lieutenant J.M. Piet were rescued shortly after they ejected from their malfunctioned aircraft over Thai airspace.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of general programming languages like BASIC, {{which could be}} run on different hardware types, allowed for programs to be written {{for more than one}} specific computer, in turn letting games written in them to spread to more end players in the programming community than before. These games included a baseball simulation game written in BASIC by John Kemeny in 1965; a BASIC bingo game by Larry Bethurum in 1966; a basketball simulation game written in BASIC by <b>Charles</b> <b>R.</b> Bacheller in May 1967; another baseball game that simulates the 1967 World Series written in BASIC by Jacob Bergmann in August 1967; Space Travel, written by Ken Thompson for a Multics system in 1969 and which led in part {{to the development of the}} Unix operating system; and Hamurabi, a text-based FOCAL game written by Doug Dyment in 1968 and converted to BASIC by David H. Ahl in 1969, and one of the first strategy video games ever made. Hamurabi and Space Travel were among several early mainframe games that were written during the time, and spread beyond their initial mainframe computers to general-purpose languages like BASIC.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the gaps led to an extensive search for the missing elements. In 1914, several people claimed the discovery after Henry Moseley predicted {{the gap in the}} periodic table for the then-undiscovered element 72. Georges Urbain asserted that he found element 72 in the rare earth elements in 1907 and published his results on celtium in 1911. Neither the spectra nor the chemical behavior he claimed matched with the element found later, and therefore his claim was turned down after a long-standing controversy. The controversy was partly because the chemists favored the chemical techniques which led to the {{discovery of}} celtium, while the physicists relied {{on the use of the}} new X-ray spectroscopy method that proved that the substances discovered by Urbain did not contain element 72. By early 1923, several physicists and chemists such as Niels Bohr and <b>Charles</b> <b>R.</b> Bury suggested that element 72 should resemble zirconium and therefore was not part of the rare earth elements group. These suggestions were based on Bohr's theories of the atom, the X-ray spectroscopy of Moseley, and the chemical arguments of Friedrich Paneth.|$|E
