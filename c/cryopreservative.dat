40|$|AbstractSingle-cell gel {{electrophoresis}} (comet assay) {{is one of}} the most common methods used to measure oxidatively damaged DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as a biomarker of oxidative stress in vivo. However, storage, extraction, and assay workup of blood samples are associated with a risk of artifactual formation of damage. Previous reports using this approach to study DNA damage in PBMC have, for the most part, required the isolation of PBMC before immediate analysis or freezing in <b>cryopreservative.</b> This is very time-consuming and a significant drain on human resources. Here, we report the successful storage of whole blood in ~ 250 μl volumes, at − 80 °C, without <b>cryopreservative,</b> for up to 1 month without artifactual formation of DNA damage. Furthermore, this blood is amenable for direct use in both the alkaline and the enzyme-modified comet assay, without the need for prior isolation of PBMC. In contrast, storage of larger volumes (e. g., 5 ml) of whole blood leads to an increase in damage with longer term storage even at − 80 °C, unless a <b>cryopreservative</b> is present. Our “small volume” approach may be suitable for archived blood samples, facilitating analysis of biobanks when prior isolation of PBMC has not been performed...|$|E

40|$|Stem cell {{transplantation}} {{has become an}} important process used to treat patients with bone marrow diseases. When implanted into patients, stem cells from the umbilical cord {{have been found to}} successfully proliferate as new neurons and glia, thereby improving the patients? health. Neurons and glia are imperative for the health and normal function of our nervous system. Neurons are electrically active cells that can produce action potentials to transmit signals based on electrochemical impulses. Glia, which comprise a large part of our nervous systems (90 % of the brain alone), were once dismissed as mere padding in the nervous system. However, it is now known that they are actually an integral component of the system, serving to facilitate and ensure the proper transmission of signals between neurons. Damage to or loss of neural cells, whether due to physical injury, removal (as in the case of cancer) or diseases such as Motor Neuron Disease (MND) and Parkinson?s disease is severely detrimental to one?s health. Using current tissue engineering technology, stem cells harvested from the matrix of the umbilical cord (known as Wharton?s Jelly), may be differentiated into neurons or glia, effectively replacing those that were lost or damaged. To ensure biocompatibility, umbilical cord matrix cells from direct relatives are used. Therefore, cryopreservation of these cells is imperative to the stem cell treatment {{to be used in the}} future.

Developing a more effective method for cryopreservation of sporozoites would help improve access to sporozoites for laboratories lacking suitable insectary facilities. In this study, P. berghei GFP-expressing sporozoites were purified from infected mosquitoes by manual dissection of salivary glands and different commercially-available, serum-free <b>cryopreservative</b> solutions were evaluated for efficient cryopreservation of the sporozoites.

40|$|One of {{the largest}} {{problems}} in current medicine is the shortage of organs for transplant due to technological limitations in the storage of organs {{for any length of}} time. A possible solution to this problem would involve cryopreservation. However, current <b>cryopreservatives</b> such as sucrose or DMSO have concerning cytotoxic issues that limit their possible applications. 	A major cause of cryoinjury is the uncontrolled recrystallization of inter and intra-cellular ice crystals that occurs during the thawing process leading to mechanical damage and dehydration. The Ben lab has thus been interested in the design of compounds that are capable of inhibiting this process but do not possess other undesirable properties found in the native compounds. These synthetic analogues have been shown to increase cellular viability post-thaw. 	A series of mixed α/β glycopeptides are prepared and analyzed for antifreeze properties. The results of this study imply {{that it is not the}} gross conformation of the glycopeptide that is responsible for activity, but rather that intramolecular relationships may be responsible for disrupting the reorganization of ice. 	A technique was devised for the incorporation of triazoles into the analogues to investigate the importance of the linker and to greatly simplify the synthesis of a library of glycoconjugates. It was found that the IRI activity of glycopeptides is very sensitive to the distance between carbohydrate and peptide backbone. 	The electron density at the anomeric oxygen is an important parameter with respect to intramolecular networks. A series of substituted galactosides is presented that modify the electronics of the anomeric oxygen. The results demonstrate that decreasing electron density at this position appears to improve IRI activity in a predictable manner. 	To better understand the remarkable IRI activity of a key analogue, it was systematically truncated. This study led to the serendipitous discovery of a series of very highly IRI active analogues that do not contain a peptide backbone.

40|$|Presented in this {{dissertation}} is {{the successful}} demonstration that nonphotochemical hole burning (NPWB) imaging {{can be used}} to study in vitro tissue cellular systems for discerning differences in cellular ultrastructures due to cancer development. This has been accomplished with the surgically removed cancerous ovarian and analogous normal peritoneal tissues from the same patient and the application of a fluorescent mitochondrion specific dye, Molecular Probe MitoFluor Far Red 680 (MF 680), commonly known as rhodamine 800, that has been proven to exhibit efficient NPHB. From the results presented in Chapters 4 and 5, and Appendix B, the following conclusions were made: (1) fluorescence excitation spectra of MF 680 and confocal microscopy images of thin sliced tissues incubated with MF 680 confirm the site-specificity of the probe molecules in the cellular systems. (2) Tunneling parameters, {lambda}{sub 0 } and {sigma}{sub {lambda}}, as well as the standard hole burning parameters (namely, {gamma} and S), have been determined for the tissue samples by hole growth kinetics (HGK) analyses. Unlike the preliminary cultured cell studies, these parameters have not shown the ability to distinguish tissue cellular matrices surrounding the chromophores. (3) Effects of an external electric (Stark) field on the nonphotochemical holes have been used to determine the changes in permanent dipole moment (f{Delta}{mu}) for MF 680 in tissue samples when burn laser polarization is parallel to the Stark field. Differences are detected between f{Delta}{mu}s in the two tissue samples, with the cancerous tissue exhibiting a more pronounced change (1. 35 -fold increase) in permanent dipole moment change relative to the normal analogs. It is speculated that the difference may be related to differences in mitochondrial membrane potentials in these tissue samples. (4) In the HGK mode, hole burning imaging (HBI) of cells adhered to coverslips and cooled to liquid helium temperatures in the complete absence of <b>cryopreservatives,</b> shows the ability to distinguish between carcinoma and analogous normal cells on the single-cell level.

These conclusions demonstrate that HBI has the potential of providing detailed information about localized intracellular environments and for detecting changes in the physical characteristics (e. g., electrical properties) of cells which constitute the in vitro tissue samples. For the latter, the long-term goal will be to develop NPHB into a diagnostic technique for the early detection of cancer by exploiting the physical differences between normal and cancerous cells and tissues. Moreover, because of the aforementioned HBI's capability to detect cellular anomalies, it has the potential of being used in conjunction with studies involving photodynamic therapy, assuming the chromophore is carefully selected...|$|R

40|$|Dimethyl {{sulfoxide}} (DMSO) {{has been}} used as a standard <b>cryopreservative</b> agent for mammalian cell culture; however, prolonged exposure of thawed cells to DMSO can alter cell growth. While DMSO is easily eliminated in ground-based experiments, removal of DMSO in flight-based experiments is more difficult due to various on-orbit constraints. Failure of cryopreservation is due to a number of factors, including intracellular ice formation, solute effect, and apoptotic cell death following thawing. One objective of this study is to identify and characterize an alternative <b>cryopreservative</b> that could be used on the International Space Station (ISS). We systematically screened for potential permeating and non-permeating agents using a human colorectal carcinoma cell line, MIP- 101. Cells were suspended in cryopreservation solution and frozen either following a two-step procedure involving initial cooling at - 1 C/min overnight followed by storage in liquid nitrogen (LN 2) vapor, or by freezing cells directly in the LN 2 vapor phase at - 10 C/min. Ability to preserve cellular function after one cycle of freeze-thawing was assessed by the recovery of viable cells in short and long-term cell culture experiments. Results showed that permeating preservatives glycerol (G) and ethylene glycol (EG) had an efficacy (80 - 110 %) comparable to, if not better than, 7. 5 % DMSO; but, propylene glycol (PG) had a somewhat lesser efficacy. Among the non-permeating preservatives, trehalose, raffinose, and dextran exhibited significant protective effect (50 - 80 %) relative to that offered by 7. 5 % DMSO, but at - 10 C and not at - 1 C/min cooling rate.

40|$|Ice {{recrystallization}} during thawing after cryopreservation {{results in}} extensive cellular damage that ultimately leads to cell death and decreased cell viabilities. This {{is a significant}} problem particularly with cryopreserved cells utilized in various regenerative medicine therapies. Given {{the success of these}} therapies to treat spinal cord injury, cartilage lesions, and cardiacdisease, the development of new and improved cryprotectants that minimize cell damageduring freeze-thawing and improve cell viability post-cryopreservation are urgently required. The current <b>cryopreservative</b> dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO, is associated with cytotoxicity in clinical settings and is not an optimal <b>cryopreservative.</b> Our laboratory is interested in synthesizing small molecules that possess the property of ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity that can be utilized as cryopreservatives without the cytotoxic effects associated with DMSO. This thesis focuses on the development of small molecule ice recrystallization inhibitors and elucidating the structural features of disaccharides and surfactants that are responsible for potent IRI activity. The first part of this study examines simple disaccharide derivatives mimicking those found in the native AFGP to determine whether disaccharide structure influences IRI activity. Towards this end, the (1, 6) -linked AFGP disaccharide analogue was synthesized, assessed for IRI activity using a splat-cooling assay, and compared to the native (1, 3) - and (1, 4) -linked AFGP disaccharide analogues. The change in linkage was found to have a profound affect on IRI activity. The second part of the study focuses on surfactants and gelators as ice recrystallization inhibitors. Our laboratory has demonstrated that carbohydrate-based hydrogelators can be potent inhibitors of ice recrystallization. While our studies have indicated that a delicate balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions is crucial for ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity, the essential structural features necessary for potent IRI activity remain unknown. To address this issue, structurally diverse amino acid-based surfactants/gelators, anti-ice nucleating agents, and glycoconjugates were synthesized and assessed for IRI activity. The results indicate that long alkyl chains and increased hydrophobicity are important for potent IRI activity and iii that the position of these alkyl chains is essential. Also, the counterion of these compounds affects the IRI activity and is related to the counterion degree of hydration. These compounds were assessed for their ability to cryopreserve human liver cells (Hep G 2) and human bone marrow cells (Tf- 1 α) in cell-based assays. Additionally, the best IRI assay solution was determined, which involved studying how the salts of the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution modulated IRI activity. Finally, small molecule ice recrystallization inhibitors were assessed for their ability to protect the viral vectors vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and herpes simplex- 1 virus at various storage conditions.

40|$|Dental pulp {{stem cells}} (DPSC), a cell type of mesenchymal origin showing high {{proliferation}} and plasticity, are an emerging source of {{adult stem cells}} offering interesting features in view of potential applications in regenerative medicine. These features prompted us {{to develop a new}} method to cryopreserve DPSC inside a whole tooth, thus avoiding the need to purify the cells before cryopreservation and reducing the initial costs and workload of tooth banking. In this study we cryopreserved 4 human deciduous whole teeth after digging micro-channels into the tooth with an Nd:YAG laser beam (laser piercing) to allow the <b>cryopreservative</b> to reach the dental pulp and preserve the cells at - 80 °C. Then, we isolated, expanded and characterized in vitro the stem cells after tooth thawing and mechanical fracture. In parallel, we characterized cells extracted from 2 teeth cryopreserved without laser piercing and from 4 non cryopreserved, non laser pierced, freshly fractured teeth. Our data demonstrate that DPSC isolated from laser pierced cryopreserved teeth show mesenchymal stem cells morphology, immunophenotype, viability and proliferation rate similar to those of cells isolated from fresh, non cryopreserved teeth, whereas significant loss of cell viability and proliferation rate was shown by cells isolated from teeth cryopreserved without laser piercing. These data support the use of this method for prospective whole tooth banking. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of cell handling and storage on cell integrity and (1) H high resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) NMR spectra. Three different cell types have been considered (lung tumoral, amniocytes, and MG- 63 osteosarcoma cells) in order for sample-dependent effects to be identified. Cell integrity of fresh cells and cells frozen in <b>cryopreservative</b> solution was approximately 70 - 80 %, with the former showing higher membrane degradation, probably enzymatic, as indicated by increased phosphocholine (PC) and/or glycerophosphocholine (GPC). Unprotected freezing (either gradual or snap-freezing) was found to lyse cells completely, similar to mechanical cell lysis. Besides enhanced metabolites visibility, lysed cells showed a different lipid profile compared to intact cells, with increased choline, PC, and GPC and decreased phosphatidylcholine (PTC). Cell lysis has, therefore, a significant effect on cell lipid composition, making handling reproducibility an important issue in lipid analysis. Sample spinning was found to disrupt 5 - 25 % of cells, depending on cell type, and HRMAS was shown to be preferable to solution-state NMR of suspensions or supernatant, giving enhanced information on lipids and comparable resolution for smaller metabolites. Relaxation- and diffusion-edited NMR experiments gave limited information on intact cells, compared to lysed cells. The (1) H HRMAS spectra of the three cell types are compared and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{evidence}} of hematopoietic restoration with placental/umbilical cord blood (PCB) grafts indicates that PCB {{can be a}} useful source of hematopoietic stem cells for routine bone marrow reconstitution. In the unrelated setting, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -matched donors must be obtained for candidate patients and, hence, large panels of frozen HLA-typed PCB units must be established. The large volume of unprocessed units, consisting mostly of red blood cells, plasma, and cryopreservation medium, poses a serious difficulty in this effort because storage space in liquid nitrogen is limited and costly. We report here that almost all the hematopoietic colony-forming cells present in PCB units can be recovered in a uniform volume of 20 ml by using rouleaux formation induced by hydroxyethyl starch and centrifugation to reduce the bulk of erythrocytes and plasma and, thus, concentrate leukocytes. This method multiples the number of units that {{can be stored in}} the same freezer space as much as 10 -fold depending on the format of the storage system. We have also investigated the proportion of functional stem/progenitor cells initially present that are actually available to the recipient when thawed cryopreserved PCB units are infused. Progenitor cell viability is measurably decreased when thawed cells, still suspended in hypertonic <b>cryopreservative</b> solutions, are rapidly mixed with large volumes of isotonic solutions or plasma. The osmotic damage inflicted by the severe solute concentration gradient, however, can be averted by a simple 2 -fold dilution after thawing, providing almost total recovery of viable hematopoietic progenitor cells...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{display the}} effect of {{different}} concentrations of glycerol, as a <b>cryopreservative,</b> {{on the quality of}} the frozen-thawed buffalo semen extended in TRIS extender enriched with disaccharides (trehalose or sucrose). Methods: Semen samples were extended in Tris-Citric acid-Fructose-Egg yolk without addition of trehalose/sucrose and with 6. 4 % glycerol as a control (TFEG-C) and with the addition of Trehalose/Sucrose and different concentrations of glycerol to ensure 60 million motile spermatozoa mL− 1. Semen cooled slowly up to 5 and equilibrated for 4  h. Semen was packed into 0. 25  mL polyvinyl French straws. The straws were placed horizontally on a rack and frozen in a vapor 4  cm above liquid nitrogen (LN 2) for 10  min then dipped in liquid LN 2. Frozen straws were thawed at 37  °C for 1  min. The parameters studied were sperm motility, sperm viability, sperm abnormality, sperm membrane integrity (HOST), percent of normal intact acrosome and DNA fragmentation. Results: The best sperm motility, sperm liveability, sperm abnormality, sperm cell membrane and DNA integrities appeared with TFES-G 5. 5 % (41. 00  ±  2. 08 %, 70. 40  ±  2. 27 %, 7. 80  ±  1. 19 %, 68. 10  ±  1. 55 %, 98. 90  ±  0. 50 %, respectively) and TFES-G 7. 3 % (41. 50  ±  1. 98 %, 70. 70  ±  2. 03 %, 10. 80  ±  0. 88 %, 69. 30  ±  1. 85 % and 96. 40  ±  0. 88 %, respectively). Conclusion: From the present study, it can be concluded that addition of glycerol (5. 5 % or 7. 3 %) to Tris-Fructose-Egg yolk-Sucrose extender might help in improvement of the post-thawed characteristics of buffalo frozen semen...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of Triladyl®, a commercial cryomedium for bull semen, in the cryopreservation of {{both human and}} animal infective trypanosomes as compared to EDTA Saline Glucose (ESG) 10 % glycerol was evaluated in the current study. Cryopreserved Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, T. evansi, T. b. brucei and T. congolense were first propagated in irradiated mice. At the peak of parasitemia, parasites were harvested by cardiac puncture and 106, 105, 104103, 102 and 10 dilutions made using whole blood bled from clean mice. These dilutions {{were divided into two}} equal portions of 0. 5 ml each and cryopreserved in both ESG 10 % glycerol and neat Triladly®. The procedure was also repeated with T. congolense and T. vivax species of trypanosomes directly isolated from naturally infected cattle. After 1 month of cryopreservation, 0. 4 ml each portion of this dilution was injected intraperitonially into irradiated Swiss white mice. Results on pre-patent period (ppp) and progression of parasitemia showed no difference in the recovery of samples cryopreserved using the 2 media. However, mice injected with T. b. brucei cryopreserved in the 2 media showed highly significantly (p < 0. 01 by t-test) lower ppp when compared to the other species of trypanosomes which had no significant difference. However, the ppp in mice injected with trypanosomes cryopreserved in ESG 10 % glycerol was significantly lower (p < 0. 05 by t-test) when compared to those cryopreserved in Triladyl®. The interaction between media and species was highly significant indicating therefore that the difference in cryopreservation between the two media varies from one species of trypanosome to the other. The interaction between dose and species was also highly significant (p < 0. 01 by t-test) implying therefore that the effect of the inoculum dose varied from one species to the other leading to the conclusion therefore that although Triladyl® appears as good a <b>cryopreservative</b> medium as ESG 10 % glycerol, the choice will be determined by the species of trypanosome...|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of <b>cryopreservative</b> agents (CPAs) to chondrocytes and natural and engineered cartilage {{is critical to}} protect the cells and tissues from freezing damage during cryopreservation, but this may cause cell damage, e. g. by osmotic shock. The damage could be minimized by {{the control of the}} cell volume excursion with the knowledge of cell membrane permeability. In this study, the cell volume responses of chondrocytes to three commonly used CPAs were evaluated using a perfusion microscope stage. The osmotic response of chondrocytes was measured to the perfusion with 1. 4 M dimethyl sulfoxide (Me 2 SO), 1, 2 -propanediol and glycerol at 21 degrees C. Cell volumes and their transients were determined with image analysis. The cell membrane permeability parameters, including the hydraulic conductivity (Lp), the CPA permeability (omega) and the reflection coefficients (sigma) in the Kedem-Katchalsky (K-K) model, and the Lp and omega in the two-parameter model were determined. The correlated K-K parameters at 21 degrees C were Lp= 0. 166 +/- 0. 035, 0. 149 +/- 0. 061, 0. 212 +/- 0. 041 microm/min atm, omega=(7. 630 +/- 0. 174) x 10 (- 2), (1. 428 +/- 0. 627) x 10 (- 2), (2. 744 +/- 0. 775) x 10 (- 2) microm/s and sigma= 0. 91 +/- 0. 09, 0. 82 +/- 0. 11, 0. 88 +/- 0. 10 for Me(2) SO, glycerol and 1, 2 -propanediol, respectively. For the two-parameter model, the parameter values were Lp= 0. 163 +/- 0. 040, 0. 128 +/- 0. 031, 0. 169 +/- 0. 025 microm/min atm, omega=(7. 881 +/- 0. 178) x 10 (- 2), (1. 529 +/- 0. 525) x 10 (- 2), (3. 716 +/- 0. 493) x 10 (- 2) microm/s for Me 2 SO, glycerol and 1, 2 -propanediol, respectively. No significant difference in the predictions of cell volume excursion during CPA addition was observed when using either the K-K model or the two-parameter model and it was hence advised to adopt the simple two-parameter model in the evaluation. The measured parameters can be used to optimise the CPA addition and removal protocols to maximize the cell survival during cryopreservation...|$|E
