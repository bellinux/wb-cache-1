50|$|In the {{downlink}} (one {{base station}} transmitting {{to one or}} more terminals), MC-CDMA typically reduces to Multi-Carrier <b>Code</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Multiplexing.</b> All user signals can easily be synchronized, and all signals on one subcarrier experience the same radio channel properties.

50|$|<b>Code</b> <b>{{division}}</b> <b>multiplexing</b> (CDM), Code division {{multiple access}} (CDMA) or spread spectrum is a class of techniques where several channels simultaneously share the same frequency spectrum, and this spectral bandwidth {{is much higher than}} the bit rate or symbol rate. One form is frequency hopping, another is direct sequence spread spectrum. In the latter case, each channel transmits its bits as a coded channel-specific sequence of pulses called chips. Number of chips per bit, or chips per symbol, is the spreading factor. This coded transmission typically is accomplished by transmitting a unique time-dependent series of short pulses, which are placed within chip times within the larger bit time. All channels, each with a different code, can be transmitted on the same fiber or radio channel or other medium, and asynchronously demultiplexed. Advantages over conventional techniques are that variable bandwidth is possible (just as in statistical multiplexing), that the wide bandwidth allows poor signal-to-noise ratio according to Shannon-Hartley theorem, and that multi-path propagation in wireless communication can be combated by rake receivers.|$|E
