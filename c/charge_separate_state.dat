Two donor-porphyrin-acceptor triads have been synthesized using a versatile Suzuki-coupling route. This synthetic strategy allows the powerful donor tetraalkylphenylenediamine (TAPD) {{to be introduced}} into tetraarylporphyrin-based triads without protection. The thermodynamics and kinetics of electron transfer in the new triads are compared with a previously reported octaalkyldiphenyl-porphyrin triad exhibiting a long-lived spin-polarized <b>charge</b> <b>separate</b> <b>state</b> (CSS), from theoretical and experimental perspectives, in both fluid solution and in a frozen solvent glass. We show that the less favorable oxidation potential of the tetraaryl-porphyrin core can be offset by using C, as a better electron-acceptor than triptycenenaphthoquinone (TNQ). The C-porphyrin-TAPD triad gives a spin-polarized charge-separated state that can be observed by EPR-spectroscopy, with a mean lifetime of 16 ms at 10 K, which is longer than in the previously reported TNQ-porphyrin-TAPD triad, following the predicted trend from calculated charge-recombination rates.

40|$|Synthesis and {{structural}} characterization of peripherally ferrocene-substituted zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc-Fc) {{were carried out}} for efficient far-red/near-IR performance in dye-sensitized nanostructured TiO 2 solar cells. Incorporating ferrocene into phthalocyanine strongly improved the dye solubility in polar organic solvents, and reduced surface aggre-gation due to the steric effect of bulky ferrocene substituents. The involvement of electron transfer reaction pathways between ferrocene and phthalocyanine in ZnPc-Fc was evidenced by completely quenched fluorescence from S 1 state (< 0. 08 % vs ZnPc). Strong absorption bands at 542 and 682 nm were observed in the transient absorption spectroscopy of ZnPc-Fc in DMSO, which was excited at a 670 nm laser pulse with a 15 ps full width at half maximum. Also, the excit-ed state absorption signals at 450 - 600 and 750 - 850 nm appeared from the formation of charge separated state of phth-alocyanine’s anion.

40|$|Presented at the 247 th National Spring Meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), Dallas, Texas on March 17, 2014. Photo induced {{excitation}} and {{electron transfer}} to reaction center generate long lived <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state</b> {{is the key}} step for natural photosynthesis process in green plants to harvest light energy. Well-arranged donor and acceptor systems {{play a vital role}} in this field. By mimicking particularly the photo induced process of natural photosynthesis, efficient supramolecular assemblies based on donor and acceptors has been designed and studied. In present study a pentad of Subphthalocyanine (SubPc) as an electron donor that comprises an axially covalently linked fullerene as an acceptor has been synthesized for a model compound to mimic natural photosynthesis. The subphthalocyanine moiety has been peripherally functionalized with three phenothiazine (PHZ) substituents to facilitate the electron transfer event between donor and acceptor. Upon photo excitation at 575 nm band of SubPc, photoinduced electron transfer to fullerene occurs which is followed by the hole transfer from SubPc to phenothiazine molecules. Thus, a long lived <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state</b> PHZ•+SubPc-C 60 •- has been achieved with a lifetime of 185 ns.

40|$|At {{the heart}} of photosystem II is the {{reaction}} center, where solar energy is used to <b>separate</b> <b>charge.</b> Set within a large and highly complex protein system, the handful of redox cofactors {{that make up the}} reaction center form an electron transport chain that converts the energy of a central, light-activated pigment into a reductant at one end and an oxidant at the other. The central aim of this thesis is to reproduce the <b>charge</b> <b>separating</b> function of photosystem II in a comparatively simple de novo designed protein maquette. The maquette effectively eliminates the complexity contributed by parts of photosystem II that are not directly involved in charge separation and facilitates a streamlined investigation of fundamental factors essential to this function. Previous work has produced light-activatable maquettes that are competent for electron transfer between tetrapyrroles but are unable to trap a <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state</b> that is necessary for fuel generation. ^ This thesis details the design, structure, and action of MZH 3, a multi-cofactor maquette that stabilizes a long-lived <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state.</b> X-ray crystallographic structures of MZH 3 are solved in complex with heme B, a synthetic zinc porphyrin, and metal ion cofactors. Despite sharing low sequence identity with natural proteins, MZH 3 exhibits significant structural similarity to cytochrome b at the heme site and bacterioferritin at the metal site. Transient absorption spectroscopy shows that the reduced state of heme B is stabilized {{in the presence of a}} tyrosine residue for 150 ms after light absorption at pH 9. 5. The binding of ferrous iron extends the <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state</b> lifetime to 300 ms at pH 7. 5. Providing the tyrosine with a hydrogen bond to histidine increases the yield of the <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state</b> but decreases its lifetime. Mutation of a heme-ligating histidine to alanine gives rise to an unexpected oxygen binding function with an oxyferrous lifetime of 38 hours, comparable to natural oxygen transport proteins. These results show that MZH 3 is a uniquely structured, functional reaction center maquette that is readily adapted to new functions. Continuing development will be directed toward multinuclear metal cluster assembly and in vivo generation of solar fuel from water. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} {{quantum yield}} of zinc porphyrin (ZnP) covalently linked to 9, 10 -bis(phenylethynyl) anthracene (AB) is strongly {{dependent upon the}} solvent properties. The bichromophoric system ZnP-AB exhibits 'normal' zinc porphyrin fluorescence in solvents that cannot coordinate to the central zinc atom. In contrast, if a Lewis base, such as pyridine, is added to a sufficiently polar solvent, the fluorescence is significantly quenched. Picosecond transient absorption measurements, in conjunction with fluorescence quenching and cyclic voltammetric measurements, suggest that the quenching mechanism is intramolecular electron transfer from ZnP to AB. The <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state,</b> ZnP. +-AB(. -), has a lifetime of not more than 220 ps before recombining. If a secondary electron acceptor, iron(III) porphyrin (FeP), is covalently connected to the AB unit, a second electron transfer from AB(. -) to FeP occurs and the <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state,</b> ZnP. +-AB-FeP. -, has a lifetime of at least 5 ns.

Here we report the synthesis and time-resolved spectroscopic {{analysis of a}} molecular triad in which a porphyrin electron donor is covalently linked to both a cyanoporphyrin electron acceptor and a benzimidazole-phenol model for the Tyr Z -D 1 His 190 pair of PSII.

From this data, the photophysical relaxation pathways were elucidated for the triad and reference compounds.

Densely packed, interpenetrated double cages were constructed from eight bis-monodentate redoxactive ligands bound to four Pd(ii) nodes. Two types of ligands consisting of electron rich phenothiazine (PTZ) or electron deficient anthraquinone (ANQ) chromophores {{were used to}} assemble either homo-octameric or mixed-ligand cages. Upon photoexcitation the homo-octameric acceptor cage undergoes intersystem crossing to a long-lived triplet state, similar to the free acceptor ligand. Excitation of the free donor ligand leads to a fluorescent state with intramolecular charge transfer character. This fluorescence is completely quenched in the homo-octameric donor double cage due to a ligand-to-metal charge transfer followed by back electron transfer on a ps timescale.

Their photophysical behavior has been investigated by both visible excitation of the ZnP chromophore and UV excitation of the NDI unit. Dyad 3 exhibits relatively inefficient quenching of the ZnP singlet excited state, slow charge separation and fast charge recombination processes. Excitation of the NDI chromophore, on the other hand, leads to charge separation by both singlet and triplet quenching pathways, with the singlet charge-separated (CS) state recombining in a sub-ns time scale, and the triplet CS state decaying in ca. 90 ns. In the triad system 4, primary formation of Fc-ZnP+-NDI− <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state</b> {{is followed by a}} secondary hole shift process from ZnP to Fc.

Reaction centers from Rhodobacter sphaeroides have been reconstituted into various liposomes, with varying fatty acid chain lengths from C 12 to C 18, resulting in different hydrophobic thicknesses of the lipid bilayer.

40|$|The main aim of work {{presented}} {{here is to}} understand photophysical processes of organic dyes and to design better organic molecules/systems which can be applied in many applications such as solar cells, photodynamic therapy, and fluorescence sensors. Developments of novel multichromophore organic materials for the above mentioned applications were made using computational tools. A {{brief description of the}} history of computational chemistry was given based on the photochemistry of organic dyes in the introductory chapters and also the importance of basis sets and functionals was discussed in order to produce accurate computational results. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations were performed to understand the photophysical processes in the porphyrin-perylene bisimide (HTPP-PDI) dyad that exhibited long-lived triplet states. The DFT results show that breaking the rigidity of PDI in HTPP-PDI was responsible for the generation of long-lived triplet states. Furthermore, six porphyrin derivatives were designed by introducing a 4, 4 ’-dicarboxybutadienyl functional group to the porphyrin moiety and studied to investigate the substituent effects on the non-coplanarity, molecular orbitals, and excitation wavelength of the porphyrin donor. Five of the six proposed porphyrin derivatives are promising donors in the HTPP-PDI dyad to replace HTPP for its potential use in photodynamic therapy. Six donor- accepter(s) systems were designed for their potential application in solar cells. Four D-A 1 -A 2 architectural triads, MTPA-TRC-AEAQ, MTPA-TRC-HTPP, MTPA-TRC-PDI, and MTPA-TRC-PBI were designed. The cascade electronic energy levels were obtained and experimentally observed, which lead to sequential electron transfers from 1 MTPA* to TRC and then to AEAQ (HTPP/PDI/PBI) module as well as a hole transfer from 1 AEAQ*(1 HTPP*/ 1 PDI*/ 1 PBI*) to MTPA module. Therefore, all the D-A 1 -A 2 systems we have designed are ambipolar. Interestingly, the lifetime of <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>states</b> of the newly designed MTPA*+-TRC-AEAQ*- was elongated to 650 ns, an eightfold of that of the donor-acceptor MTPA-TRC parent molecule (80 ns). However, different <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state</b> lifetimes were obtained for MTPA*+-TRC-PDI*-(22 ns) and MTPA*+-TRC-PBI*-(75 ns). The photophysical results suggested that the <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state</b> may decay to the triplet <b>state</b> when the <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state</b> exhibits a higher energy level than the triplet state.

A 23 -fold fluorescence emission was quenched via non-radiative decay pathway in the absence of Zn 2 +. However, when the Zn 2 + chelated to the sensor fluorescence intensity was increased remarkably. A 32 -fold fluorescence increase was overserved and calculation results suggested this could be due to the inhibition of the electron-transfer pathway and enhanced rigidity of sensor-Zn 2 + complex. The response selectivity of Zn 2 + over Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cu 2 +, and Hg 2 + ions was also studied using DFT calculations and it was found that Zn 2 + has a strong binding affinity to the sensor, which could be a potential application in the detection of Zn 2 +...|$|R

This thesis describes the use of transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) as a means to study charge generation and recombination in these blend films. In blend films of P 3 HT and PCBM, the absorption spectrum associated with the positive and negative charges have been identified and the transient decay kinetics analysed to reveal the mechanisms leading to charge recombination losses in the films. The effects of annealing treatment, along with the effects of decreasing polymer regioregularity or different polymer chain terminating end-groups on the blend film properties and morphology are also discussed. For films with a low concentration of PCBM in polystyrene, absorption and emission from the individual PCBM molecules are observed. As the PCBM concentration is increased, aggregation related changes causes the absorption in the visible region to increase disproportionately, an additional emission peak at higher energies to appear and a decrease in the lifetime of the PCBM triplet excited state. These changes are linked to electronic interactions between fullerenes in a molecular crystal form of PCBM. Blends of F 8 BT polymer with PCBM show poor photovoltaic device performance. This is explained by the quick deactivation of the F 8 BT excited state by Förster energy transfer to the PCBM. As the PCBM excited state is stable compared to the <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state,</b> the PCBM triplet is formed via inter-system crossing from the singlet to be the final product of photoexcitation.

40|$|AbstractFollowing light-induced {{electron}} transfer between the primary donor (P) and quinone acceptor (QA) the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center (RC) undergoes conformational relaxations which stabilize the primary <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state</b> P+QA−. Dehydration of RCs from Rhodobacter sphaeroides hinders these conformational dynamics, leading to acceleration of P+QA− recombination kinetics [Malferrari et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 115 (2011) 14732 - 14750]. To clarify the structural {{basis of the}} conformational relaxations and the involvement of bound water molecules, we analyzed light-induced P+QA−/PQA difference FTIR spectra of RC films at two hydration levels (relative humidity r= 76 % and r= 11 %). Dehydration reduced the amplitude of bands in the 3700 – 3550 cm− 1 region, attributed to water molecules hydrogen bonded to the RC, previously proposed to stabilize the charge separation by dielectric screening [Iwata et al., Biochemistry 48 (2009) 1220 – 1229]. Other features of the FTIR difference spectrum were affected by partial depletion of the hydration shell (r= 11 %), including contributions from modes of P (9 -keto groups), and from NH or OH stretching modes of amino acidic residues, absorbing in the 3550 – 3150 cm− 1 range, a region so far not examined in detail for bacterial RCs. To probe in parallel the effects of dehydration on the RC conformational relaxations, we analyzed by optical absorption spectroscopy the kinetics of P+QA− recombination following the same photoexcitation used in FTIR measurements (20 s continuous illumination).

40|$|Following light-induced {{electron}} transfer between the primary donor (P) and quinone acceptor (QA) the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center (RC) undergoes conformational relaxations which stabilize the primary <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state</b> P + Q A −. Dehydration of RCs from Rhodobacter sphaeroides hinders these conformational dynamics, leading to acceleration of P + Q A − recombination kinetics [Malferrari et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 115 (2011) 14732 - 14750]. To clarify the structural {{basis of the}} conformational relaxations and the involvement of bound water molecules, we analyzed light-induced P + Q A − /PQA difference FTIR spectra of RC films at two hydration levels (relative humidity r = 76 % and r = 11 %). Dehydration reduced the amplitude of bands in the 3700 - 3550 cm − 1 region, attributed to water molecules hydrogen bonded to the RC, previously proposed to stabilize the charge separation by dielectric screening [Iwata et al., Biochemistry 48 (2009) 1220 - 1229].

40|$|Two new supramolecular boxes, (ZnMC) 2 (rPBI) 2 and (ZnMC) 2 (gPBI) 2, {{have been}} {{obtained}} by axial coordination of N,N′-dipyridyl-functionalized perylene bisimide (PBI) dyes to the zinc ion centers of two 2 + 2 porphyrin metallacycles (ZnMC) [trans,cis,cis-RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (Zn · 4 ′-cis-DPyP) ] 2). The two molecular boxes involve PBI pillars with different substituents at the bay area: the “red” PBI (rPBI) N,N′-di(4 -pyridyl) - 1, 6, 7, 12 -tetra(4 -tert-butylphenoxy) perylene- 3, 4 : 9, 10 -tetracarboxylic acid bisimide) containing tert-butylphenoxy substituents and the “green” PBI (gPBI) N,N′-di(4 -pyridyl) - 1, 7 -bis(pyrrolidin- 1 -yl) perylene- 3, 4 : 9, 10 - tetracarboxylic acid bisimide) bearing pyrrolidinyl substituents. Due to the rigidity of the modules and the simultaneous formation of four pyridine-zinc bonds, these discrete adducts self-assemble quantitatively and are remarkably stable in dichloromethane solution. The photophysical behavior of the new supramolecular boxes has been studied in dichloromethane by emission spectroscopy and ultrafast absorption techniques. A different photophysical behavior is observed for the two systems. In (ZnMC) 2 (rPBI) 2, efficient electron transfer quenching of both perylene bisimide and zinc porphyrin chromophores is observed, leading to a <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state,</b> PBI [...] Zn+, in which a perylene bisimide unit is reduced and zinc porphyrin is oxidized. In the deactivation of the perylene bisimide localized excited state, an intermediate zwitterionic charge transfer state of type PBI [...] PBI+ seems to play a relevant role. In (ZnMC) 2 (gPBI) 2, singlet energy transfer from the Zn porphyrin chromophores to the perylene bisimide units occurs with an efficiency of 0. 7. This lower than unity value {{is due to a}} competing electron transfer quenching, leading to the <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state</b> PBI [...] Zn+. The distinct photophysical behavior of these two supramolecular boxes is interpreted in terms of energy changes occurring upon replacement of the “red” rPBI by “green” gPBI...|$|R
40|$|We report time-resolved {{excited state}} {{absorption}} measurements which demonstrate subpicosecond photoinduced electron transfer using soluble derivatives of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) as donors blended with a functionalized fullerene (methanofullerene) as acceptor. The subpicosecond photoinduced absorption spectra of the polymer/methanofullerene blends show that electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor occurs within a picosecond of photoexcitation of the conjugated polymer. Precise {{determination of the}} electron transfer dynamics was obtained by monitoring the dichroic ratio. The <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state</b> is metastable and persists into the millisecond time domain, yielding an asymmetry of 10 orders of magnitude between the forward and reverse electron transfer times. The increased miscibility of the functionalized methanofullerene with the conjugated polymer is important for preparation of films with sufficiently high acceptor concentrations for practical devices based on photoinduced charge separation. ...|$|R
40|$|Near-steady-state {{photoinduced}} absorption (PIA) and photoluminescence {{studies are}} presented on photoinduced electron transfer reactions from poly[2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 '-ethylhexyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) and poly[3 -(2 -(3 -methylbutoxy) ethyl) thiophene] (P 3 MBET) as donors (D) onto a homologous series of tetracyano-p-quinodimethane (TCNQ) derivatives containing fused aromatic rings as acceptors (A) to systematically study {{the effect of}} acceptor electron affinity. We observe that composite films of these D/A couples give rise to long-lived <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>states</b> upon photoexcitation, as evidenced from the formation of polaron bands (radical cation absorption) in the PIA and the concomitant loss of the metastable triplet PIA and photoluminescence that are observed in pristine MEH-PPV and P 3 MBET.

40|$|Radical ion pairs {{generated}} by Photoinduced Electron Transfer in methylsulfanyl sexithiophene/fullerene derivatives deposited as films are studied by transient EPR spectroscopy. The spin polarization {{pattern of the}} transient EPR spectrum consists of characteristic antiphase emission/absorption lines typical of spin correlated radical pairs with electron dipolar and spin exchange interactions. The mean distance of 2. 8 nm between the two unpaired electrons of the pair is obtained from the dipolar coupling constant value of - 0. 12 mT extracted from spectrum simulation. The <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>state</b> has a lifetime of 10 mu s at 120 K. A mechanistic model is proposed for the generation and decay processes involving the observed intermediate radical ion pair.

They consist of a ruthenium(II) -polypyridyl sensitizer featuring chemically attached 3, 3 ′-dimethyl- 4, 4 ′-viologen and 4, 4 ′-viologen electron acceptors. The binding of the chemically attached electron acceptors by the three structurally different crown ethers, DB 30 C 10, BBO 5 O 5, and AAO 5 O 5, offers a remarkable tool for the enhancement of the lifetimes of the <b>charge</b> <b>separated</b> <b>states</b> (ôCS), up to a factor of 2 104.
