40|$|A {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} for experimentally realizing the famous two-slit gedaenken experiment using photons. As elegantly discussed for electrons by Feynman, a particle's quantum pathways interfere to produce fringes in the probability density for the particle {{to be found}} at a particle location. If the path taken by the particle is experimentally determined, the complementarity principle says that the fringes must disappear. To <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>experiment</b> with photons is difficult because normally the act of determining a photon's location destroys it. We propose to overcome this difficulty by putting a type- 2 optical parametric amplifier (OPA) in each arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and observing fringes at the output. An OPA responds to an input photon by increasing its probability to produce a pair of photons with polarization orthogonal to the input, the detection of which allows partial inference about the path taken by the input photon without destroying it. Thus, the measurement is of the quantum nondemolition (QND) type...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{experiment}} {{was about to}} study of water jet pumps with different diameters and nozzle-to-throat area ratios. Most experimental studies on water jet pumps mainly carried out to assess the maximum efficiency. But maximum efficiency occurs when the suction lift is relatively small for a given head loss through the pump, which implies, when the suction flow rate is maximum. However, suction lift is inversely proportional to flow rate. But {{in the field of}} application there are many cases (such as drainage, dredging, well-pumping and other systems) where suction lift is more important factor than any other for water jet pumps, which gives importance to the assessment of depending factor of suction lift of water jet pumps. Six different jet pumps of two different nominal diameter each of three different nozzle to throat area ratio were made to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>this</b> <b>experiment.</b> The results revealed that the nozzle-to-throat area ratio was an important parameter to characterize the suction lift of the jet pumps, but nominal diameter had a negligible play role...|$|E

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThere {{have been}} a number of {{attempts}} to measure the expansion rate of the Universe using age-dating of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). Assuming stars in LRGs form at the same time, age-dating of two populations of LRGs at different redshifts can provide an estimate of the time difference associated with the corresponding redshift interval (dt/dz). This gives a direct estimate of the Hubble parameter at the average redshift of the two populations. In this thesis, we explore the validity of the assumptions in this method using LRGs identified in the Millenium Simulation. We study the properties of LRGs simulated using two semi-analytical models for galaxy evolution and discuss LRG selection criteria. We use stellar population modelling and spectral synthesis to estimate the errors on ages that can be expected and discuss optimization of an age-dating experiment. We find that H(z) using simulated galaxies from MS can be recovered with high accuracy. Using Single Stellar Populations (SSPs) to age -date LRGs is not sufficient for this experiment but if the star formation histories of galaxies are used, accurate ages are obtainable.
