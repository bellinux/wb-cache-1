5|$|With this {{contribution}} of von Neumann, the axiomatic {{system of the}} theory of sets avoided the <b>contradictions</b> <b>of</b> earlier systems, and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms {{that could be used to}} prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of Königsberg, in which Kurt Gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.|$|E
5|$|While largely {{forced on}} Graham by the {{inadequate}} forces available and the inherent <b>contradictions</b> <b>of</b> Australian strategic policy, his decision was {{contrary to the}} advice of the senior task force engineer, Major Brian Florence. A number of senior infantry officers had also resisted the idea, including one of Graham's battalion commanders, Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, commanding officer 5 RAR, who had served in the Korean War where the Australians had suffered a large number of casualties from mines originally laid by other UN forces. Yet unlike many of his colleagues, as an Armoured Corps officer Graham had not served in Korea, and many of the assumptions he developed about mine warfare in North Africa had remained unchallenged. For the first six months the barrier minefield had resulted in a dramatic decline in Viet Cong infiltration, reducing re-supply movement by up to 80 percent. However, recognising the threat the obstacle posed to them, the Viet Cong had immediately begun attempting to penetrate it, cutting gaps in the fence and clearing lanes through the minefield to restore the flow of supplies, as well as lifting mines for their own use. Conceived to hinder the movement of the Viet Cong between their jungle bases and the villages on which they relied for supplies, the failure of South Vietnamese forces to protect the barrier minefield ultimately allowed the Viet Cong to remove thousands of mines, many of which were subsequently used against 1 ATF. While in keeping with the orthodoxy of Australian counter-insurgency doctrine, Graham's strategy ultimately proved both controversial and costly, and despite initial success, the minefield became a source of munitions for the Viet Cong and later {{the decision was made to}} remove it amid growing casualties.|$|E

40|$|Much {{discussed}} {{in recent times}} {{is the idea of}} the knowledge society. However, on closer inspection we find that this is a highly contested concept and, moreover, it is associated with new ideologies, of which three are {{discussed in}} the article: postmodernism, neo-liberalism and third wayism. It is argued that these new ideologies are impacting on higher education, which is consequently experiencing far-reaching cultural contradictions. The article examines six <b>of</b> these: the <b>contradiction</b> <b>of</b> teaching and research, the <b>contradiction</b> <b>of</b> efficiency and scholarship, the <b>contradiction</b> <b>of</b> massification and democratisation, the <b>contradiction</b> <b>of</b> management and leadership, the <b>contradiction</b> <b>of</b> opinion and knowledge, and the <b>contradiction</b> <b>of</b> science and technology...|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of this Supermom ideal, {{cultural}} <b>contradictions</b> <b>of</b> motherhood widely exist. Working mothers are often critiqued for being selfish and not spending enough time with their children. They defend their position by saying they work to support their children economically. Homemakers are often critiqued for not pursuing meaningful careers. They respond by saying that the childcare and other domestic work they do for their families is much more important. Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution for most women.|$|E

500|$|Much of Bogdan-Pitești's {{controversial}} political career, inaugurated by {{his support}} for anarchism, was dedicated to activism and support for revolution. He also {{had an interest in}} the occult, and maintained close contacts with Joséphin [...] "Sâr" [...] Péladan—sponsoring Péladan's journey to Bucharest (1898). He was detained by the authorities at various intervals, including an arrest for sedition during the 1899 election, and was later found guilty of having blackmailed the banker Aristide Blank. Late in his life, he led Seara, a Germanophile daily, as well as a literary and political circle which came to oppose Romania's entry into World War I on the Entente Powers' side. He was arrested one final time upon the end of the war, by which time he had become the object of public hatred.

[...] Other critics, however, dismissed Avatars pro-environmental stance as inconsistent. Armond White remarked that, [...] "Cameron’s really into the powie-zowie factor: destructive combat and the deployment of technological force.... Cameron fashionably denounces the same economic and military system that make his technological extravaganza possible. It’s like condemning NASA—yet joyriding on the Mars Exploration Rover." [...] Another author called the film [...] "socialism-disguised-as-nonsense enviro stuff" [...] and argued that the very process of creation and promotion of Avatar emitted enough carbon to undermine the film's ecological message.

500|$|Conflict, or Angelou's {{presentation}} of opposites, is another theme in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas. As Lupton states, Angelou constructs a plot by mixing opposing incidences and attitudes - Angelou's [...] "dialectical method". The book {{is full of}} conflicts: in Angelou's marriage, her feelings between being a good mother and a successful performer, the stereotypes about other races, and her new experiences with whites. Lupton believes this {{presentation of}} conflict is what makes Angelou's writing [...] "brilliant"; she finds that the strength of Singin' and Swingin' [...] comes, in part, from Angelou's duplication of conflicts underlying the plot, characters, and thought patterns in the book. Lupton adds, [...] "Not many other contemporary autobiographers {{have been able to}} capture, either in a single volume or in a series, the opposition of desires that is found in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas and, to a lesser extent, in Angelou's other volumes". Even the closing sentence of the book ("Although I was not a great singer I was his mother, and he was my wonderful, dependently independent son") demonstrates Angelou's dialectical construction, sums up the <b>contradictions</b> <b>of</b> Angelou's character, and alludes to mother/son patterns in her later books.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} [...] "I'm Not Fooled By That Cheap Disguise", a 1991 essay {{deconstructing}} the Batman mythos, refer to Anarky {{as a challenge}} to Batman's social and political world view, and to the political position indirectly endorsed by the themes of a Batman adventure. As the Batman mythos is centered on themes of retribution and the protection of property rights, the invitation to readers to identify with Batman's vigilantism is an invitation to adopt political authoritarianism. The authors summarize that position as [...] "the inviolability of property relations and the justification of their defense by any means necessary (short of death)." [...] However, the authors contend that Anarky [...] "potentially redefines crime" [...] and invites the reader to identify with a new political position in favor of the disenfranchised, which Batman [...] "can not utterly condemn". The authors contend that the creation of Anarky and dialogue by other characters represented a shift towards [...] "self-conscious awareness of the Batman's hegemonic function, questioning the most central component of the Batman's identity—the nature of crime and his relation to it." [...] However, the authors remain skeptical of Anarky's commercial nature, pointing out Anarky could be [...] "incorporated as another marketing technique [...] The <b>contradictions</b> <b>of</b> capitalism would thus permit the commodification of criticisms as long as they resulted in profits." ...|$|E
