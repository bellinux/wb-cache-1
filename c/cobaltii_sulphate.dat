40|$|Selective {{transport}} of zinc(II) from <b>cobalt(II)</b> <b>sulphate</b> solutions using a supported liquid membrane impregnated with DP- 8 R extractant was studied. Several variables were investigated: stirring {{speed of the}} feed phase, stirring speed and composition of the receiving phase, diluent of the organic phase, metal concentration and pH of the feed phase, extractant concentration and the lifetime of the membrane. Conditions for the separation of both metals were established: (i) aqueous feed: pH 3. 0 ± 0. 02, [Co]/[Zn] molar concentration ratio near 22; (ii) receiving phase: 0. 5 M sulphuric acid; (iii) membrane phase: DP- 8 R 10...|$|E
40|$|Metal {{complexes}} {{formed by}} the reactions of keto and enol forms of isobutryl acetic acid hydrazide[IBAH], 4 -amino benzoic acid hydrazide[4 -ABAH] and 4 -cyano benzoic acid hydrazide[4 -CBAH] with manganese(II) and <b>cobalt(II)</b> <b>sulphate</b> ions were prepared and characterized by elemental analysis, conductance measurements, i. r., and electronic absorption spectra studies. The {{results showed that the}} hydrazides reacted with the metal salts in 1 : 2 molar ratio in all the complexes and acts as neutral bidentate ligands. The solubility test on the ligands and its metal(II) complexes revealed their solubility in ethanol and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO). The molar conductance of the ligands and metal(II) complexes measured are indicative of their non-electrolytic nature. The infrared spectra of the hydrazide showed that ʋ(C=O), the carbonyl stretching mode called “amide 1 ” band, the coupling between the in-plane bending ʋ(N-H) and ʋ(C-N) called the “amide II ” band and the stretching frequency for the amino group ʋ(NH 2) all experienced shifts to lower wave numbers in the complexes suggesting the coordination of the moieties to the metal ions. The electronic absorption spectra of Co(II) complexes showed two absorption bands located at 23, 250 - 19, 300 c...|$|E
40|$|Producing {{nickel and}} cobalt metal by high {{pressure}} acid leaching (HPAL) of nickel laterites is {{becoming one of}} Australia's largest mineral processing industries. However, the background chemical information for this process, including the fundamental physicochemical properties of acidic metal sulphate leachate solutions, is not well known. In order to improve the efficiency of current and future HPAL plants, high quality physicochemical and thermodynamic data will be necessary. This thesis reports measurements on the densities and heat capacities of nickel and cobalt sulphate solutions and their mixtures along with detailed studies {{of the nature of}} the species present and the thermodynamics of their interconversions. Densities and heat capacities of nickel and cobalt sulphate and perchlorate solutions and their ternary mixtures were measured using a vibrating tube densimeter and a flow microcalorimeter respectively. These data were used to calculate the apparent molal volumes and heat capacities of these solutions. Standard partial molal quantities were then obtained by appropriate extrapolation procedures, along with the volume and heat capacity changes of ion pair formation. A comparison has been made between experimental densities and heat capacities with those predicted by Young's rule. Good agreement was obtained except when the degree of complexation varied significantly in the mixtures. The various ion pair species in nickel and cobalt sulphate solutions, along with those of magnesium sulphate (which is a major impurity in HPAL leachates), were reinvestigated by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. Doubly solvent separated ion pairs, solvent shared ion pairs and contact ion pairs were shown to exist simultaneously in solution and their concentrations were determined from dilute to near-saturated concentrations. Evidence for the possible existence of a triple ion, M 2 SO 4 2 +, was also obtained in highly concentrated solutions. The equilibrium constants of the stepwise reactions and the effective hydration numbers of ions and ion pairs were also calculated. The heats of complexation of nickel(II) and <b>cobalt(II)</b> <b>sulphate</b> were determined at different ionic strengths in sodium perchlorate media by titration calorimetry. These data were fitted to a specific ion interaction model to obtain the standard state values. The corresponding entropies of complexation were calculated and were found to be the major contributor to the stability of the complexes...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} of <b>cobalt(II)</b> from acidic <b>sulphate</b> solutions through PEHFSD was investigated using the extractant DP- 8 R in Exxsol D 100. The acidic feed solution containing Co(II) was {{passed through the}} tube side, and pseudo-emulsions of DP- 8 R/Exxsol D 100 and sulphuric acid was passed through the shell side in counter-current mode, using a single microporous hydrophobic polypropylene hollow fiber contactor for extraction and stripping. In PEHFSD the aqueous strip (sulphuric acid) solution was dispersed in the organic membrane solution in a reservoir tank with an impeller stirrer to form a strip dispersion. This pseudo-emulsion phase is circulated from the tank to the membrane module to provide a constant supply of the carrier solution to the membrane micropores. Several hydrodynamic and chemical parameters, such as variation in feed pH (3 – 7), cobalt concentration in feed (0. 17 – 1. 7 10 3 M), carrier concentration (0. 16 – 1. 28 M), etc., were investigated. Mass transfer modelling was performed and {{the validity of the}} model was evaluated with experimental data. Moreover, the system was applied in the cobalt purification of synthetic lithium solutions derived from the processing of rechargeable batteries, with cobalt/lithium separation factor values around 25.
