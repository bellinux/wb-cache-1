50|$|Physicists {{have also}} {{developed}} other MRI-based {{techniques such as}} arterial spin labeling (where arterial blood is magnetically tagged before it enters into the tissue of interest {{and the amount of}} labeling is measured and compared to a control recording obtained without spin labeling), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (for measuring some key metabolites such as N-acetylaspartate and lactate within the living brain) and diffusion tensor imaging (for mapping white matter tracts within the living brain). Whereas structural MRI and CAT scanning have a large place in medicine, fMRI and its brethren techniques are still largely devoted to neuroscience research. However, very recently neurologists have started to use fMRI to begin to answer clinical questions, such as how long after thrombotic stroke is it safe and effective to give <b>clot-dissolving</b> <b>drug</b> like tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). Similarly, PET and SPECT have moved out of neuro-research and are increasingly being used clinically to help diagnose and differentiate types of dementing illnesses (dementia).|$|E
40|$|Retinal Vein Occlusion is an eye {{condition}} {{which affects}} an estimated 16, 4 million people worldwide. The disease occurs when clots are formed inside retinal veins and disturb the oxygen delivery throughout the retina. This causes partial or even complete blindness {{in the affected}} eye. Current treatment methods can only slow down vision loss by tempering the side effects. A promising curative treatment method is retinal vein cannulation. In such procedure, the surgeon would insert a needle via a small incision in the eye into the affected veins and subsequently inject an adequate dose of a <b>clot-dissolving</b> <b>drug.</b> A surgical microscope, placed above the patient's eye lens, is used to visualize the instrument while it is being manoeuvred inside the eye. Despite promising pre-clinical studies, high complication rates keep surgeons from practising this treatment. The targeted vessels have a thickness ranging from 30 µm tot 400 µm and are extremely fragile. Unintended motions, such as the surgeon’s hand tremor and rotations of the patient’s eye due to instrument manipulation, make it extremely difficult to precisely insert the needle into the occluded vessel. Further, the surgeon can hardly detect whether the vessel is correctly punctured as puncture forces are mostly below the perceptible level and also visual information is not conclusive. Lastly, even if correctly inserted, the surgeon still needs to keep the needle steady throughout the injection phase which can be as long as 45 minutes. In short, the risk of damaging the vessel or the retina is extremely high. Because of these reasons, retinal vein cannulation remains a controversial therapy and is not performed in clinical practice today. This work reports on the development and evaluation of dedicated robotic technology to enable surgeons to perform retinal vein cannulation in a safe and successful manner. A prototype of a robotic system developed prior to this research is taken as a starting point. The robot offers a solution to immobilize the eye throughout the intervention and is designed to position a needle with µm-level precision. In this work, the system is further developed. An additional robotic platform enables the surgeon to pre-operatively position the system {{with respect to the}} patient in a timely and precise manner. Further, both a comanipulation and a telemanipulation strategy are proposed to control the system. In the case of comanipulation, the surgeon and the robot simultaneously hold the instrument. The surgeon retains full control over the instrument motion. Viscous forces generated by the robot minimize the surgeon's hand tremor such that the needle can be precisely inserted into the targeted vessel. In fact, the surgeon acquires a superhuman positioning precision. In the case of telemanipulation, the surgeon controls the tool indirectly via a joystick. To this end, a novel joystick based on an innovative mechanism is developed. Motion scaling between the joystick and the robot is used to minimize the effect of the surgeon's hand tremor. Another challenge exists in the development of an injection needle which is sufficiently slender to cannulate a wide range of vessels. In this research, the world's thinnest stainless steel injection needle is developed, having a tip diameter of only 80 µm. Additionally, the needle is equipped with an optic force sensor which is shown to be capable of automatically detecting 98 % of all puncture events. Auditory feedback is used to inform the surgeon on such event. Finally, the robot can lock the needle into position once inserted into the vessel. This enables a prolonged hands-free injection of the drug. The different functionalities of the developed technology are thoroughly validated {{with the aid of a}} number of dedicated test setups that were developed in the course of this research. Further, a junior retinal surgeon was invited to perform retinal vein cannulation on retinal vessels of ennucleated porcine eyes with the aid of the developed technology. The best results were obtained under assistance of the comanipulation system while receiving auditory feedback on the puncture events. The results are extremely encouraging as the technology enabled the surgeon to perform twenty successful cannulations and injections out of twenty attempts. When asked which operation mode he preferred, i. e. comanipulation or telemanipulation, the surgeon indicated to favour the comanipulation system as it closely mimics conventional retinal surgery. He indicated that he found it very intuitive to use and that the system delivers adequate levels of precision to reliably cannulate retinal vessels. Based on the promising research results and the accompanying scientific dissemination, a major step was made in the technology transfer of the presented developments. An IOF leverage project aimed at valorizing the technology was granted and a bilateral project in collaboration with a leading pharmaceutical company was established with the ultimate goal to clinically enable robot-assisted retinal vein cannulation. Further, the current robot design together with promising alternative robot embodiments presented in this PhD are covered in a patent application. Finally, EurEyeCase, a H 2020 European project coordinated by KULeuven, was granted. The project broadens the application of the robotic system to other challenging retinal procedures. The final goal of the project is to conduct a number of human trials with the aid of the developed technology. status: publishe...|$|E
50|$|Tissue {{plasminogen}} activator (tPA) {{has remained}} the only <b>clot-dissolving,</b> thrombolytic <b>drug</b> available for clinical use in patients with ischemic stroke since its approval in 1996. Only about 5% of stroke patients are treated with tPA because of its short treatment time-window, suboptimal efficacy, and risk of intra-cranial hemorrhage.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{pulsed laser}} energy to clear arteries {{obstructed}} by thrombus (blood clot) and plaque {{has emerged as}} a promising method for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Current techniques for laser thrombolysis are limited because they cannot completely clear the clot in arteries, especially where a large volume clot is presented. Mural clot is a potent stimulus for reocclusion. We suggest that the combination of laser thrombolysis and localized intramural delivery of <b>clot-dissolving</b> <b>drugs</b> during the procedure may be a solution to this limitation. Ninety pulses of 30 { 70 mJ were delivered onto gelatin-based thrombus model with a °ushing catheter. A solution of 1 m °uorescent particles as a drug model was injected at a rate of 4 mL/min in coincidence with the laser delivery. The controls were performed by injecting drug after laser thrombolysis. We measured the penetration of the particles in gelatin and the sizes of the lumen and stained areas. The results of this study demonstrated the possibility of enhancing laser thrombolysis by delivering drugs into thrombus. It was found that the particles could be driven several hundred micron in gelatin, and the lumen areas would be increased up to 25 % if the areas were dissolved by the drugs...|$|R
