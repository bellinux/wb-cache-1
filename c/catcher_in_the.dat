He was the catcher for battery mate Johnny Cueto, the second battery mate he started and caught for in the Midsummer Classic after teammate Matt Cain in 2012.|$|E
50|$|O'Dea had {{the misfortune}} of playing on the same teams {{alongside}} some of <b>the</b> best <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National League, which limited his playing time. Although he played most of his 12-year MLB career as a backup catcher, O'Dea {{was considered one of}} <b>the</b> best defensive <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> major leagues prior to World War II.|$|R
2500|$|Aerial Cradle (Scarabs): Based on Corteo's [...] "Paradise" [...] act, three aerial cradles are spaced diagonally {{above the}} stage and fliers are thrown and caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arms of <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cradles.|$|R
2500|$|As fielding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slips {{requires}} quick reflexes {{and sure}} hands, usually <b>the</b> most adept <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team {{will make up}} the slip cordon. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen. Specialist slip fielders are sometimes called [...] "slippers".|$|R
5|$|Prior to Johnny Bench, Hartnett was {{considered}} the greatest <b>catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of the National League. A six-time All-Star, he appeared in four World Series during his playing career. At {{the time of his}} retirement, Hartnett held the career records for catchers in home runs, runs batted in, hits, doubles and in most games played as a catcher. Hartnett was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955.|$|E
5|$|The novel The <b>Catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rye by J. D. Salinger plays a {{major part}} in the episode, as the South Park boys are {{inspired}} to write their own book when they feel Salinger's book does {{not live up to}} its controversial reputation. The episode also mocks actress Sarah Jessica Parker and the Kardashian family from the reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.|$|E
5|$|When the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks met in Major League Baseball's season opening {{series at}} the Sydney Cricket Ground in Sydney on 22 and 23 March 2014, Chappell, who had {{represented}} South Australia as a <b>catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Claxton Shield before embarking on his successful cricket career, was a commentator for the broadcasts, carried on Australia's Channel Nine {{and in the}} United States by MLB Network. He worked with Matt Vasgersian and former Cy Young Award winner John Smoltz.|$|E
50|$|His {{breakout}} {{season was}} {{made even more}} impressive by the increased defensive presence behind the plate. He {{has long been known}} as a capable-to-above-average defending catcher, but his 2012 season proved that he has been one of <b>the</b> best defensive <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|R
50|$|On occasion, {{teams have}} traded knuckleball {{pitchers}} and their <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same transaction. For example, Josh Thole and Mike Nickeas went with Dickey when the pitcher {{was traded to}} the Toronto Blue Jays in late 2012, and the team later signed Henry Blanco, who also caught for Dickey.|$|R
2500|$|Fisk {{was among}} <b>the</b> top {{offensive}} <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American League <b>in</b> his eight full {{seasons with the}} Boston Red Sox. [...] Over that time, he averaged 20 home runs and 70 RBI per season. [...] His best year in Boston was in 1977 when Fisk hit [...]315 with 26 HR and 102 RBI.|$|R
5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's The <b>Catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rye, {{which he}} had first read in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of the}} book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E
5|$|On December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman {{shocked the}} world by murdering 40-year-old {{musician}} and activist, John Lennon, outside The Dakota, his New York apartment building. Chapman's motives were fabricated from pure delusion, fueled by an obsession with the fictional character Holden Caulfield and his similar misadventures in J.D. Salinger's The <b>Catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rye. In one instant, an anonymous, socially awkward and mentally unstable 25-year-old fan of The Beatles, who had fluctuated between idealizing Lennon and being overcome {{with a desire to}} kill him, altered the course of the history of music.|$|E
5|$|Cognizant of his {{increasing}} {{age and the}} wear catching places on one's body, the Phillies reduced Ruiz's workload during spring training, hoping to keep him fresh throughout the regular season. Regardless, he insisted upon catching pitchers' bullpen sessions so he could develop a feel and rapport with each pitcher. On July 25, Ruiz became the first <b>catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National League, and the second catcher in Major League Baseball history, to catch four no-hitters when teammate Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs. Overall, Ruiz lost his starting job to Cameron Rupp, and had significant declines in many aspects of his game, particularly those at which he previously excelled, including framing pitches – in 2015, Baseball Prospectus ranked him worst in the league at doing so – and the mental aspect of the game, as he made several uncharacteristic errors.|$|E
50|$|On April 25, 2008, the Mariners and Johjima {{agreed to}} a three-year {{contract}} extension. However, after losing playing time to two other <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2009 season, Johjima opted out of the final two years of this extension so he could return to playing in Japan, where he signed with the Hanshin Tigers of Japan's Central League. He retired a month into the 2012 season.|$|R

2500|$|Often the challengers {{have been}} {{unfamiliar}} with the plot itself. Shelley Keller-Gage, {{a high school teacher}} who faced objections after assigning <b>the</b> novel <b>in</b> her class, noted that [...] "the challengers are being just like Holden... They are trying to be <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rye". A Streisand effect has been that this incident caused people to put themselves on the waiting list to borrow the novel, when there were none before.|$|R
5|$|In 1999, Rodríguez was {{selected}} as the American League MVP. He set a new American League record for home runs in a single season among catchers with 35. Rodríguez was also the first catcher to have more than 30home runs, 100 runs batted in, and 100 runs scored in the history of Major League Baseball. In addition, he holds the distinction of being the first <b>catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of the league to amass more than 20home runs and 20stolen bases. From May 8, 1999 to June 1, 1999, Rodríguez had a career high 20 game hitting streak. He had 25 stolen bases, which was fifth most among catchers {{in the history of the}} league. He led the league in times grounded into a double play, with 31. Rodríguez was only the ninth <b>catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of Major League Baseball to win the Most Valuable Player award, and he was the first to win it since Thurman Munson in 1976. He was named on all of the ballots, getting seven first place votes and six second place votes. Rodríguez was the sixth Puerto Rican to win the award, and the fourth player from the Texas Rangers to win it. He also won the Silver Slugger Award for the sixth time in a row and {{was selected}} Most Valuable Player by Baseball Digest. He was again named to all-star teams by the Associated Press, The Sporting News, and Baseball America. While he was hitting home runs, he wasn't taking many walks. He is one of only six players active in 2009 who have had at least 30 home runs in a season in which they had more homers than walks (34 HR, 24 BB in 1999). The others are Alfonso Soriano (39–23 in 2002, 36–33 in 2005, 33–31 in 2007), Garret Anderson (35–24 in 2000), Ryan Braun (34–29 in 2007), Joe Crede (30–28 in 2006), and José Guillén (31–24 in 2003).|$|E
5|$|Making {{his debut}} with the Texas Rangers on June 20, 1991, {{he became the}} {{youngest}} player to catch in a major league game that season at 19 years of age. He immediately established himself as an excellent hitter who was also proficient in throwing out would-be base-stealers. No other <b>catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past 35years has been as successful at {{this aspect of the}} game, with Rodríguez throwing out 48% of attempted basestealers through May 2006. He started many of the Rangers games {{at the end of the}} season, including 81 of the last 102. Rodríguez became the youngest player in the history of the Texas Rangers to hit a home run, on August 30, 1991, facing the Kansas City Royals and right-hander Storm Davis. He was named to the Major League Baseball (MLB) Rookie All-Star team by both Topps and Baseball America and finished in fourth place in the AL Rookie of the Year voting. He also placed first in throwing out runners, catching 48.6percent of runners attempting to steal.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rye has had {{significant}} cultural influence, and works {{inspired by the}} novel have been said to form their own genre. Sarah Graham assessed works influenced by The <b>Catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rye to include the novels Less Than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis, The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky, A Complicated Kindness by Miriam Toews, The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, Ordinary People by Judith Guest, and the film Igby Goes Down by Burr Steers.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} franchise-record eighth Opening Day start at <b>catcher</b> for <b>the</b> Astros <b>in</b> 2007, {{breaking}} a tie with Alan Ashby. On July 22 of that year, Ausmus passed Gary Carter {{to move into}} sole possession of second place in major league career putouts by a <b>catcher.</b> <b>In</b> addition, he passed Ted Simmons that day to take sole possession of 12th place all-time on the games caught list, with 1,772. In 2007, he had the second-best fielding percentage (.995) and range factor (8.04) of all <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NL, while being charged with only two passed balls.|$|R
50|$|Herrmann {{developed}} {{a reputation as one}} of <b>the</b> best knuckleball <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American League from his work with such knuckleball pitchers as Hoyt Wilhelm, Wilbur Wood and Eddie Fisher. Wood won twenty or more games for four consecutive years between 1971 and 1974 with Herrmann as his catcher. Unfortunately for Herrmann, trying to catch the unpredictable knuckleball pitch also contributed to his leading American League <b>catchers</b> four times <b>in</b> passed balls allowed. In , Herrmann was selected to be a member of the American League All-Star team.|$|R
2500|$|Franklin Witman [...] "Blimp" [...] Hayes (October 13, 1914 – June 22, 1955) was an American {{professional}} baseball <b>catcher.</b> He played <b>in</b> Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Athletics, St. Louis Browns, Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, and Boston Red Sox. Although Hayes was {{considered one of}} <b>the</b> best <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American League <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s and early 1940s, he played for an Athletics team that routinely finished in last place. A six-time All-Star, he holds the major league record of most consecutive games played by a catcher.|$|R
25|$|A strong {{influence}} on the play is the novel The <b>Catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rye by J. D. Salinger. There are some very overt references to it, as when the protagonist explains the thesis paper he has just written on The <b>Catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Rye to the family who takes him in for the night. There are also more subtle allusions made both in the script and in the cinematography of the film version, such as when various characters begin to take on Holden Caulfield-esque characteristics and attitudes.|$|E
25|$|In literature, farting {{features}} {{prominently in}} the novel The <b>Catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rye. Since the 1970s, farting has increasingly featured in film, especially lowbrow comedies such as Blazing Saddles.|$|E

50|$|Although Lollar {{was often}} overshadowed by his contemporary, New York Yankees catcher Yogi Berra, he was {{considered}} to be one of <b>the</b> best <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> major leagues during the 1950s.

2500|$|During Bennett's era, {{catchers}} {{lacked the}} protective equipment present in 20th century baseball. [...] It {{was not until}} 1888 that specialized catcher's mitts began to be used on the non-throwing hand. [...] As a result, catchers' hands, fingers, legs, and bodies took a beating in Bennett's time. [...] For this reason, <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> era were not every-day players, needing time to recuperate after catching a game. [...] When Bennett began his major league career, the major league record for games caught in a season was 63 games.|$|R
2500|$|Although Hayes {{was rated}} {{as one of}} <b>the</b> top <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> Major League Baseball, he had a {{reputation}} for being temperamental and, this may {{have played a role in}} Mack's decision to trade him to the Cleveland Indians for <b>catcher</b> Buddy Rosar <b>in</b> May 1945. Contemporary news reports expressed astonishment over the trade, as Hayes was considered one of <b>the</b> best <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league while Rosar was refusing to play for the Indians due to a salary dispute. Hayes immediately assumed the starting catcher's role for the Indians, leading American League catchers with 145 games played and a [...]988 fielding percentage. He was selected to be a reserve catcher for <b>the</b> American League <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1945 All-Star Game however, the game was cancelled due to wartime travel restrictions.|$|R
25|$|Early in his career, Virgin {{occasionally}} {{acted as}} wicketkeeper in first-class matches, {{and he continued}} to do so occasionally in one-day matches throughout his career.

2500|$|He had won as many batting {{championships in}} {{a span of}} four years as all other Major League <b>catchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of {{baseball}} through 2009 combined.
