Updates and parameter modifications could be done from this supervising point. There is still no constraint to allow a connection from any analyzer to the Internet or the central operations LAN for notifications or to update itself.

30|$|Another {{interesting}} <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>usage</b> of code-anomaly agglomerations {{occurred in}} the OODT system. Differently from the example above, we observed an architectural problem instance confined to the RPCWorkflowManager component. This component encloses two main classes: XmlRpcWorkflowManager and XmlRpcWorkflowManagerClient. Both classes contribute to the realization of an architectural problem called Connector Envy (Garcia et al. 2009). Connector Envy indicates that the component’s implementation mix its main functionalities with connector functionalities. This problem can dramatically reduce the component’s maintainability. The mixed functionalities force developers to reason about two or more different concepts while changing a single class. This can hinder developers, leading them (i) to make the code structure more complex or (ii) to introduce bugs. In a system such as OODT {{it would not be}} easy to diagnose this problem. OODT contains several complex functionalities implemented by hundreds of classes. As a result, diagnose architectural problems in this system requires the analysis of several classes. Due to the large scope of analysis, this task would be exhaustive and time consuming. This scenario often leads developers to neglect the diagnose of architectural problems.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Current {{industrial}} carbon electrodes {{are typically}} manufactured by blending petroleum coke particles (the filler) with molten {{coal tar pitch}} (the binder) and extruding the resultant mix to form the ‘green electrode’. This is then baked under controlled conditions. In <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>usage</b> as anodes in steel electric furnaces (or as other carbon and graphite products), the electrodes could undergo further processing like pitch impregnation or graphitization. During heat treatment, some of the organics are destructively distilled, vaporized or decomposed, resulting in carbon deposition in the electrode. As the vaporized materials exit {{the body of the}} electrode they cause porosity in the walls, which results in reduction in density, current carrying capacity and flexural strength. The paper presents investigations to improve some physico-chemical characteristics of these electrodes (such as coefficient of thermal expansion, mechanical strengths, density, pore volume, porosity etc.), obtained in different manufacture steps, by addition of varieties of coal tar pitch. These include attempts to improve the chemical compatibility of the coke-pitch system in the mixture and establish the method and th...|$|E

40|$|Communication {{requirements}} of earth observation satellites {{has been increasing}} {{in the last few}} years in parallel with an increase of the number of sensors embarked as well as sophistications of these sensors (e. g. Advanced SAR sensors like those foreseen for Cosmo Skymed 2 nd Generation). For future missions either a transition at higher frequency band (e. g. K-band) operation or a better exploitation of bandwidth resources available in X-band (to day normally used) has to be implemented. Given the disadvantages which would be incurred with a transition at K-band (rain fading, higher free space loss, upgrading of ground segment, redesign of payload components), a better exploitation of the X-band segment available for Earth Exploration Satellite (ESS) seems the preferred approach at least for the near term. This paper shows the spectral efficiency advantage that could be obtained thanks to the combination of the polarization reuse and MMSE filtering at the ground stations ’ side in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>usage</b> of the available X-band bandwidth.
