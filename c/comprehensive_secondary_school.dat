40|$|This study {{examined}} barriers to Physical Education (PE) {{in a sample}} of Christian and Muslim schoolgirls attending UK <b>comprehensive</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools.</b> Also assessed was whether religion and school year (age) had any impact upon barrier strength and if school year × religion interactions existed. A questionnaire was developed and exploratory factor analysis was utilised to uncover barrier factors. Six factors were found; these were: ‘Self-Conscious’, ‘Sensations’, ‘Embarrassment’, ‘Dislike/Unimportant’, ‘PE Uniform’ and ‘Religiosity’. For the total sample, the highest quotient was assigned to the ‘PE Uniform’ barrier factor. The remaining barrier factors received relatively low quotients. When analysed by religious persuasion, it was found that four of the barrier factors were rated significantly higher by the Muslim girls. For both Christian and Muslim samples, barrier strength tended to increase in line with school year (age). School year × religion interactions were also evident. These results provide a contemporary picture of potential barriers to PE for girls attending <b>comprehensive</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools</b> in the UK...|$|R
