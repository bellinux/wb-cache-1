30|$|The {{abundant}} calcite {{found in}} plant ashes mostly {{derives from the}} initial thermal decomposition of the intra- and extracellular calcium oxalates whewellite and weddellite that occur in most organs and tissues of plants [18, 19]. Calcium carbonate is found originally in cell walls and as <b>cellular</b> <b>mineral</b> as well, although in smaller amounts than the oxalates [10]. The calcium oxalates have recurrent shapes, the most common being equant to short prismatic crystals, round polycrystalline druses, elongated fibrous crystals known as raphides and styloids, and aggregates of submicrometric crystallites, called crystal sand [10, 19].|$|E
30|$|The {{data from}} our {{adhesion}} and proliferation {{studies showed that}} cultured human bone cells could attach to and grow on both CNW and HGL nanostructures. Furthermore, the adhesion and proliferation outcomes were within approximately 75 % of the level that occurred on the control Thermanox™ surface, a material specifically engineered to promote these cellular processes. Cells also spread on both the HGL and CNW surfaces, with some subtle but evident {{differences between the two}} surfaces in that aspect of cell behavior. Differentiation data showed that the cells were significantly affected by the topographical cues of the underlying graphene surfaces. The HGL surface maintained cells in a less-advanced differentiation state (as determined by ALP data), whereas the CNWs promoted the later stage of the cell differentiation process, as marked by the <b>cellular</b> <b>mineral</b> production (demonstrated by the calcium data). In conclusion, we have shown that graphene-coated surfaces are biocompatible and that the topography of the graphene coating can have a profound influence on the long-term behavior of cells, in particular the cellular differentiation and mineralization process involved in the generation of new bone (osteogenesis). The optimization of these designed topographical features based on graphene-coated surfaces using PECVD may lead to improved outcomes in tissue engineering.|$|E

40|$|Fossils {{reported}} previously {{from the}} Early Silurian (Llandovery) lower Massanutten Sandstone (Virginia, USA) are formally described here as Prattella massanuttense gen. & sp. nov. Organization into cellular filaments embedded in extracellular matrix, {{the sizes of}} cells and filaments and the fluvial origin of deposits that host the fossils are all consistent with cyanobacterial affinity. Prattella massanuttense combines preservation as carbonaceous compression at a macroscopic scale with <b>cellular</b> preservation by <b>mineral</b> replacement of cell contents at a microscopic scale. These fossils provide the earliest direct evidence for the occurrence of cyanobacteria in fluvial habitats {{and add to the}} knowledge of terrestrial ecosystems that hosted early stages of land plant evolution. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2009, 160, 284 – 289...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that collagen, {{the most abundant}} protein in animals, exists as a distribution of nanoscale morphologies in teeth, bones, and tendons. This fundamental characteristic of Type I collagen has not previously been reported and provides {{a new understanding of}} the nanoscale architecture of this ubiquitous and important biological nanomaterial. Dentin, bone, and tendon tissue samples were chosen for their differences in cellular origin and function, as well as to compare mineralized tissues with a tissue that lacks mineral in a normal physiological setting. A distribution of morphologies was present in all three tissues, confirming that this characteristic is fundamental to Type I collagen regardless of the presence of <b>mineral,</b> <b>cellular</b> origin of the collagen (osteoblast versus odontoblast versus fibroblast), anatomical location, or mechanical function of the tissue...|$|R
40|$|Klotho-deficient mice have {{accelerated}} aging phenotypes, whereas overexpression of Klotho in mice extends lifespan. Klotho is an anti-aging single-pass membrane protein predominantly {{produced in the}} kidney, with shedding of the ami-no-terminal extracellular domain into the systemic circulation. Circulating levels of soluble Klotho decrease with age, and the klotho gene is associated with increased risk of age-related diseases. The three forms of Klotho protein have distinct functions. Membrane Klotho forms a complex with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors, functions as an obligatory co-receptor for FGF 23, which is involved in aging {{and the development of}} chronic diseases via regulation of Pi and vitamin D metabolism. Secreted Klotho functions as a humoral factor with pleiotropic activities including regu-lation of oxidative stress, growth factor signaling, and ion homeostasis. Secreted Klotho is also involved in organ protection. The intracellular form of Klotho suppresses inflammation-mediated <b>cellular</b> senescence and <b>mineral</b> metabolism. Herein we provide a brief overview of the structure and function and recent research about Klotho...|$|R
5000|$|His {{nomination}} for {{election to the}} Royal Society reads: [...] Professor Briggs has made several remarkable discoveries of exceptionally preserved fossils. His researches have elucidated their evolutionary significance, resulting in a significant shift in the focus of palaeontology toward these important windows {{on the life of}} the past. His work on the arthropods from the Burgess Shale of British Columbia has altered our perception {{of the nature of the}} Cambrian radiation. He demonstrated that morphological disparity among living arthropods is similar to that in the Cambrian, indicating that the functional and developmental constraints on form were operative from the earliest stages of metazoan evolution. He described the first evidence of the soft-tissues of conodonts, which resolved the vexed question of their affinities, with the recognition that these important fossils are the earliest known vertebrates. More recently he has pioneered a combination of new experimental approaches to the process involved in fossilization of the 'soft parts' of animals. His chemical and mineralogical investigations have demonstrated how soft tissues can be replicated at the <b>cellular</b> level in <b>minerals</b> such as apatite (the Medusa effect).|$|R
40|$|One {{purpose of}} this work was to examine if a {{modification}} of the exterior insulation finishing system can lower the number of outer walls damaged by damp. The modification is the cut of the cellular plastic which is 45 degrees instead of a horizontal cut. One other purpose was; is <b>cellular</b> plastic or <b>mineral</b> wool better as insulation to minimize the dampness {{in this type of}} outer walls? A third purpose was to examine if there is any difference of dampness in the outer walls if using a gravel bed or concrete stones next to the outer wall. To examine these three purposes a laboratory experiment with three test walls with an exterior insulation finishing system was built. The difference between the three walls was the insulation. One wall was built with mineral wool with a horizontal cut, one with cellular plastic with a horizontal cut and the third with cellular plastic with a cut of 45 degrees. Simulations of pelting rain and measurements of dampness were carried out for 21 days. The measurements were taken at the same time every evening. After 21 days small samples of tree from the walls was weight, dried in an oven and then weight again to get the quantity of moisture in the samples before they were dried. A diffusion calculation of two outer walls, one with cellular plastic and one with mineral wool, was completed to examine the difference between the relative humidity in the walls. An identical calculation without a plastic film was executed too. The result of the calculations showed a minimal difference in the walls built with a plastic film. When the film was removed the result presented critical values. The result of the laboratory experiment indicates that the test wall with the cut of 45 degrees is better than the walls with a horizontal cut of the insulation. The differences were minimal but possible to read. Some critical, too high, values regarding the moisture content in wood were found and they came from the sills in the walls that had insulation with horizontal cuts. Of the two insulation types the result of calculations and laboratory experiment shows a minimal difference but they both indicates a better result for the mineral wool. The conclusion of this work indicates that cellular plastic with a 45 degree cut is slightly better than the horizontal cut. The comparison of <b>cellular</b> plastic and <b>mineral</b> wool indicates that the mineral wool is better. Another conclusion of this work is that the material on the ground next to the outer wall did not alter the dampness in the wall...|$|R
40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the cytotoxicity and <b>cellular</b> adhesion of <b>Mineral</b> Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) and Biodentine (BD) on periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDL). Methods. PDL cells were obtained from nonerupted third molars and cultured; MTS cellular profusion test was carried out in two groups: MTA and BD, with respective controls at different time periods. Also, the LIVE/DEAD assay was performed at 24 [*]h. For evaluation of cellular adhesion, immunocytochemistry was conducted to discern the expression of Integrin β 1 and Vinculin at 12 [*]h and 24 [*]h. Statistical analysis was performed by the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results. MTA and BD exhibited living cells up to 7 days. More expressions of Integrin β 1 and Vinculin were demonstrated in the control group, followed by BD and MTA, which also showed cellular loss and morphological changes. There was a significant difference in the experimental groups cultured for 5 and 7 days compared with the control, but there was no significant statistical difference between both cements. Conclusions. Neither material was cytotoxic during the time evaluated. There was an increase of cell adhesion through the expression of focal contacts observed in the case of BD, followed by MTA, but not significantly...|$|R
40|$|Metabolic {{and bone}} effects were {{investigated}} in growing (G, n¼ 45) and mature (M, n¼ 45) rats fed a high-fat/high-sucrose diet(HFS) isocaloric to the chow diet of controls (C, n¼ 30 per group). At week 19, {{a subset of}} 15 rats in each group (HFS or C, at both ages) was analyzed. Then one-half of the remaining 30 HFS rats in each groups continued HFS and one-half were shifted to C until week 27. Although no serum or bone marrow inflammation was seen, HFS increased visceral fat, serum leptin and insulin at week 19 and induced further alterations in lipid profile, serum adiponectin, and TGFb 1, TIMP 1, MMP 2, and MMP 9, suggesting a prediabetic phenotype and cardiovascular dysfunction at week 27 more pronounced in M than G. These events were associated with dramatic reduction of osteoclastic and osteoid surfaces with accelerated mineralizing surfaces in both HFS age groups. Mineral metabolism and its major regulators were disturbed, leading to hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. These changes were associated with bone alterations in the weight-bearing tibia, not in the non-weight-bearing vertebra. Indeed in fat rats, tibia trabecular bone accrual increased in G whereas loss of trabecular bone inMwas alleviated. At diaphysis cortical porosity increased in G and even more inMat week 27. After the diet switch, metabolic and bone cellular disturbances fully reversed in G, but not in M. Trabecular benefit of the obese was preserved in both age groups and inMthe age-related bone loss was even lighter after the diet switch than in prolonged HFS. At the diaphysis, cortical porosity normalized in G but not in M. Hypocalcemia in G and M was irreversible. Thus, the mild metabolic syndrome induced by isocaloric HFS is able to alter bone <b>cellular</b> activities and <b>mineral</b> metabolism, reinforce trabecular bone, and affect cortical bone porosity in an irreversible manner in older rats. © 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research...|$|R
