Thrie-beam {{is similar to}} <b>corrugated</b> <b>rail,</b> but it has three ridges instead of two. They deflect 3 to 6 ft: more than rigid barriers, but less than flexible barriers. Impact energy is dissipated through deformation of the rail elements, posts, soil and vehicle bodywork, and friction between the rail and vehicle. Box beam systems also spread the impact force {{over a number of}} posts due to the stiffness of the steel tube.|$|E

The slab track model consists of elastically supported double Euler-Bernoulli beams. In fact, both wheelset and slab track are symmetric structures {{and the issue of}} the wheelset/slab track interaction is reduced to the wheel/rail interaction. The nonlinear equations of motion describing the wheelset/slab track interaction due to the short-pitch <b>corrugated</b> <b>rail</b> are solved using the time-domain Green’s functions method and the convolution theorem. The wheelset/slab track interaction due to the short-pitch <b>corrugated</b> <b>rail</b> exhibits a critical velocity when the vibration reaches the maximum leve...|$|E
30|$|Finally, from a {{vibrational}} {{point of}} view, {{it has been}} proved that the numerical model has adequately responded to variations in the dynamic overload calculated. Once the loads corresponding to a grinded track are introduced, the vibrational response is reduced considerably. Consequently, {{it can be concluded}} that the grinding process of a <b>corrugated</b> <b>rail</b> surface can significantly reduce the vibrations generated by passage of a vehicle, especially in lateral dynamics. Nevertheless, the fact of introducing loads as discrete forces at different timesteps has induced a predominant frequency in the numerical model corresponding to the loadsteps application. For further investigations, the authors will work to overcome this handicap.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of rail and wheel corrugation on vertical and tractive forces is studied, in this paper, for high-speed trains {{with the aim}} of evaluating the risk for surface initiated rolling contact fatigue (RCF). A train-track interaction model for vertical dynamics, which accounts for a prescribed torque on the wheelset and for the highfrequency content of the induced force spectrum, is employed. Corrugation distributions according to ISO 3095 (smooth rail) and as obtained from field measurements (<b>corrugated</b> <b>rail)</b> are considered. A parametric study is carried out in which level of corrugation, tractive effort and vehicle speed are varied. Also the influences of axle load and unsprung mass are investigated. The results are interpreted in terms of rolling contact fatigue impact spectra and by using the Tgamma energy model. If is found that the two models give similar tendencies regarding the surface initiated RCF impact. As expected, the traction effort will dominate the development of RCF, but significant influences are also found for corrugation, speed, axle load and unsprung mass...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of periodic irregularities with distinct wavelengths (corrugation) {{on the low}} rail of small radius curves is studied through mathematical modelling, numerical simulations, field measurements and laboratory investigations. One year of monitoring of roughness on the low rail of a 120 m radius curve on the metro of Stockholm Public Transport (SL) showed severe growth of rail corrugation with wavelengths of about 5 cm and 8 cm. About 300 days after rail grinding, the corrugation was observed to reach a constant amplitude. Based on a section removed from the <b>corrugated</b> <b>rail,</b> a laboratory investigation showed plastic deformation in the lateral direction towards the field side. No significant difference in microstructure was found when corrugation troughs and peaks were compared. A time-domain model for the prediction of long-term roughness growth on curves has been developed and validated versus field measurements. The simulation model is able to simultaneously capture the low-frequency vehicle dynamics due to curving and the high-frequency dynamics due to excitation by for example short-pitch corrugation.

30|$|The {{high loads}} {{generated}} in the wheel–rail contact depend on the vehicle speed, as Hawari and Murray [8] demonstrated through a multi-body interaction model in NUCARS software able to reproduce accurately the dynamic performance of the vehicle. This not only affects the severity of track damage, but also affects the track elements, as Ling et al. [9] demonstrated through a multi-body FE simulation. In this study, {{some of the main}} causes of the fracture of clips were performed, and several mitigation measures to reduce track vibrations were suggested. In fact, the great adaptability of numerical models has led to incorporate preventive and corrective maintenance measures in the calculations. Regarding the preventive measures, Collette et al. [10] developed a multi-body FE model capable to predict the effectiveness of a dynamic vibration absorber located at the vehicle axle for mitigating rutting corrugation. They concluded that this phenomenon was amplified when the vertical resonance of the vehicle track and the torsional resonance of the wheelset matched. Hence, acting on the torsional modes of wheelsets could reduce this phenomenon appearing. However, from the corrective measures’ point of view, Egaña et al. [11] studied the effectiveness of a liquid capable of modifying friction of a <b>corrugated</b> <b>rail</b> surface. They established that by applying this liquid, the accelerations {{generated in the}} wheel–rail contact and the corrugation growth were reduced.|$|E

50|$|Rail {{corrugation}} {{is a type}} {{of track}} wear that develops from track and train wheel set contact over time. Once this process has started it will begin to grow exponentially worse as time progresses. The wear that develops due to the wheel set contact between railways takes its form in the many troughs and crests it leaves behind over time {{which may or may not}} develop into rail corrugation depending on the circumstances. Rails that are heavily used and put under continual and constant wear will develop rail corrugation. Rail corrugation is represented in wavelength. Typically, heavily <b>corrugated</b> <b>rails</b> experience a concave deformation on the top of the railroad track in 20mm to 200mm intervals. Significant rail corrugation can decrease the service life span of tracks and make the replacement of the affected railroad track necessary. Rail corrugation is caused by the friction between the rail and the train wheels tangentially, vertically, and axially. Wear corrugation is a result of friction on the lower rail, which comes in contact with the train wheel. Excessive corrugation can be identified by the wavelength found on the higher, or outer, rail. Rail corrugation may be limited or lessened with the use of heat treated or alloyed rails, as oppose to the traditionally used carbon composite rail. The estimated tendency for wear is calculated by taking into account fluctuations in track and wheel set contact which causes the amount of wear to vary. The dynamic properties of different lines of the track can lead to varied degrees of rail corrugation through the use of high-speed wheel sets. In a study of high-speed railroad tracks, four types of tracks were studied for their tendency to develop corrugation (RHEDA 200, AFTRAV, STEDEF, and high performance ballasted track) and of the four considered the ballasted track was the one least prone to rail corrugation with the AFTRAV track being the second most reliable as well.|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{finite element}} (FE) dynamic frictional rolling contact model is presented {{for the study}} of short pitch corrugation that considers direct and instantaneous coupling between the contact mechanics and the structural dynamics in a vehicle-track system. In this study, we examine the system responses in terms of vibration modes, contact forces and the resulting wear with smooth rail and <b>corrugated</b> <b>rail</b> with progressively increasing amplitude to infer the conditions for consistent corrugation initiation and growth. Wear is assumed to be the damage mechanism, and short pitch corrugation is modeled using wavelengths from field observations of a Dutch railway. The contribution of this paper is a global perspective of the consistency conditions that govern the evolution of short pitch corrugation. The main insights are as follows: (1) the longitudinal vibration modes are probably dominant for short pitch corrugation initiation; (2) during short pitch corrugation evolution, the interaction and consistency between longitudinal and vertical modes should determine the development of short pitch corrugation, and once a certain severity is reached, vertical modes become dominant; and (3) in the case simulated in this paper, corrugation does not grow probably due to not only the different resulting main frequencies of the vertical and longitudinal contact forces, but also the inconsistency between the frequencies of the vertical and longitudinal vibration modes and the resulting wear. It is inferred that in the continuous process of initiation and growth of the corrugation, there should be a consistency between them, and this could be done by the control of certain track parameters.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} simulations of railhead wear due to initial sinusoidal and broad-band roughness using a time-domain wheel–track vertical interaction model integrated with a three-dimensional wheel–rail contact model. As typical roughness wavelengths are short and frequencies are high compared with vehicle body motions, {{the vehicle is}} simplified to an unsprung wheel mass. The rail is modelled as a Timoshenko beam discretely supported by pads, sleepers and ballast. The wheel–rail contact in the interaction model is modelled with a non-linear Hertzian contact spring. The obtained wheel–rail forces are then incorporated into the three-dimensional contact model to calculate wear over the railhead. The wheel–rail contact is modelled as non-Hertzian and non-steady based on the Variational Method [G. Xie, S. D. Iwnicki, Calculation of wear on a <b>corrugated</b> <b>rail</b> using a three-dimensional contact model, in: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Contact Mechanics and Wear of Rail/Wheel Systems, Brisbane, Australia, Materials Australia, 2006] and the wear {{is assumed to be}} proportional to the friction work. Cases of both a free and a driven wheel with a constant torque are considered. The phase angles between dynamic wheel–rail force and roughness are examined and wear is found to be almost in-phase with roughness and therefore, no roughness growth is predicted by the model as presented in its current form. Although clearly in contradiction to reality where roughness grows under certain conditions this work leads to interesting question about why roughness growth is predicted by a simple contact model but not when complexity is increased to include non-Hertzian and non-steady contact conditions...|$|E

The simulation model is able to simultaneously capture the low-frequency vehicle dynamics due to curving and the high-frequency dynamics due to excitation by for example short-pitch corrugation. Non-Hertzian and non-steady effects in the wheel‒rail contact are considered. Simulations show that the short-pitch corrugation on the small radius curve at SL is generated by wear induced by the leading wheelset of passing bogies. The corrugation wavelengths 5  cm and 8  cm {{are determined by the}} excitation of the first antisymmetric and first symmetric bending eigenmodes of the wheelset, respectively. The importance of accounting for the phase difference between the calculated wear and the present rail irregularity in predictions of corrugation growth is demonstrated. Due to a phase difference approaching a low constant value, the growth of corrugation is predicted to eventually develop into a stationary state where it is translated along the rail with a constant amplitude. For track geometry and traffic conditions corresponding to the selected curve at SL, simulations indicate the wheel–rail friction coefficient to have a significant influence on corrugation growth. For friction coefficient 0. 6 (measured at dry contact conditions), corrugation growth is predicted at several wavelengths whereas for friction coefficient 0. 3 (due to application of a friction modifier) it is shown that an initial rail irregularity is gradually worn off by passing traffic. Based on a new set of field measurements in the same curve (another year of monitoring), it was shown that the application of a friction modifier directly after grinding is an effective mitigation measure to prevent the {{development of}} rail corrugation...|$|E
40|$|Causes and {{consequences}} of out-of-round railway wheels are investigated through literature studies, full-scale field experiments, out-of-roundness measurements, and numerical simulations. Both defects around the complete wheel circumference (e. g. polygonal wheels with wavelengths up to one wheel circumference) and local defects (e. g. wheel flats) are studied. Wheel tread irregularities occurring in different types of train traffic in Sweden (high-speed, passenger, freight, commuter, subway) have been assessed using out-of-roundness measurements. These measurements show that high roughness levels with wavelengths between 3 cm and 8 cm (corrugation) are present on tread braked freight wheels and tread braked powered X 2 high-speed train wheels. A previously known polygonalization of C 20 subway wheels has been quantified. The influence {{of different types of}} wheel out-of-roundness on the vertical dynamic wheel-rail contact force and on the track response is investigated through extensive field tests and numerical simulations. Measured responses are used to calibrate and validate numerical models for simulation of train-track interaction in the time domain. An existing multibody system model for simulation of general three-dimensional train-track interaction is extended to include rolling contact mechanics according to the FASTSIM model and wear according to the Archard model, and also general wheel and rail profiles. The numerical model employs an iteration scheme with simulation of dynamic train-track interaction in the time domain coupled to a model of long-term wear. The extended model is used to study wheel polygonalization on subway wheels and rail corrugation growth due to (corrugated or round) powered high-speed train wheelsets. Some polygonalization wavelength-fixing mechanisms depending on the track properties have been discovered. The influence of <b>corrugated</b> wheels on <b>rail</b> corrugation growth is found to be negligible...|$|R
