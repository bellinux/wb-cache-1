[...] Diagnosis is less easy in the early stages, when the three features are not yet obvious. Suspicion often comes about when the developmental delay of the individual is associated with hyperuricemia. Otherwise, the diagnosis should be alleged when developmental delay is associated with kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) or blood in the urine (hematuria), caused by uric acid stones. For the most part, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome is first suspected when self-inflicted injury behavior develops.

Of these, only individuals with Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, de Lange syndrome, and familial dysautonomia recurrently display loss of tissue as a consequence. Biting the fingers and lips is a definitive feature of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome; in other syndromes associated with self-injury, the behaviors usually consist of head banging and nonspecific self-mutilation, but not biting of the cheeks, lips and fingers.

METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was applied {{to a series of}} families affected with intellectual disability in order to identify variants underlying disease phenotypes. RESULTS: We present data of three families in which we identified the disease-causing mutations and which benefited from receiving a clinical diagnosis: <b>Cornelia</b> <b>de</b> <b>Lange,</b> Cohen <b>syndrome</b> and Dent- 2 disease. The genetic heterogeneity and the variability in clinical presentation of these disorders could explain why these patients are difficult to diagnose.

No studies have compared rates of these behaviours in TSC with those in other syndrome groups matched for degree of disability or investigated risk markers for these behaviours in TSC. Methods Data from the Challenging Behaviour Questionnaire were collected for 37 children, aged 4 to 15  years, with TSC. Odds ratios were used to compare rates of self-injury and aggression in children with TSC with children with idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (ASD), fragile X, <b>Cornelia</b> <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> and Down <b>syndromes.</b> Characteristics were measured using the Mood Interest and Pleasure Questionnaire, the Activity Questionnaire, the Social Communication Questionnaire, the Repetitive Behaviour Questionnaire, the Wessex Behaviour Schedule and the revised Non-communicating Children Pain Checklist. Mann-Whitney U analyses were used to compare characteristics between individuals with self-injury and aggression and those not showing these behaviours. Results Rates of self-injury and aggression in TSC were 27 % and 50 %, respectively. These are high but {{not significantly different from}} rates in children with Down syndrome or other syndrome groups. Both self-injury and aggression were associated with stereotyped and pain-related behaviours, low mood, hyperactivity, impulsivity and repetitive use of language. Children who engaged in self-injury also had lower levels of interest and pleasure and showed a greater degree of ‘insistence on sameness’ than children who did not self-injure. Aggression was associated with repetitive behaviour. The majority of these associations remained significant when the association with level of adaptive functioning was controlled for.

40|$|Background: Recent {{research}} has identified differences in relative attention to competing social versus non-social video stimuli in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Whether attentional allocation {{is influenced by}} the potential threat of stimuli has yet to be investigated. This is manipulated in the current study by {{the extent to which the}} stimuli are moving towards or moving past the viewer. Furthermore, little is known about whether such differences exist across other neurodevelopmental disorders. This study aims to determine if adolescents with ASD demonstrate differences in attentional allocation to competing pairs of social and non-social video stimuli, where the actor or object either moves towards or moves past the viewer, in comparison to individuals without ASD, and to determine if individuals with three genetic syndromes associated with differing social phenotypes demonstrate differences in attentional allocation to the same stimuli. Methods: In study 1, adolescents with ASD and control participants were presented with social and non-social video stimuli in two formats (moving towards or moving past the viewer) whilst their eye movements were recorded. This paradigm was then employed with groups of individuals with fragile X, <b>Cornelia</b> <b>de</b> <b>Lange,</b> and Rubinstein-Taybi <b>syndromes</b> who were matched with one another on chronological age, global adaptive behaviour, and verbal adaptive behaviour (study 2). Results: Adolescents with ASD demonstrated reduced looking-time to social versus non-social videos only when stimuli were moving towards them. Individuals in the three genetic syndrome groups showed similar looking-time but differences in fixation latency for social stimuli moving towards them. Across both studies, we observed within-and between-group differences in attention to social stimuli that were moving towards versus moving past the viewer.

40|$|Background: Recent {{literature}} on the behavioural phenotype of <b>Cornelia</b> <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> <b>syndrome</b> suggests that the trajectory {{of a number of}} behaviours may be atypical in the syndrome, including mood and sociability however {{there is a lack of}} quantitative research to support these findings. Methods: Three empirical studies were conducted. The first study employed a questionnaire design to follow up mood, interest and pleasure over a two-year period in individuals with <b>Cornelia</b> <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The second study involved the development of an informant-based questionnaire to examine the trajectory of sociability in <b>Cornelia</b> <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The third study employed an experimental design to examine indicators of social anxiety in adolescents and adults with <b>Cornelia</b> <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Results: Low mood and reduced initiation of social interactions with unfamiliar people is characteristic of older adolescents and adults with <b>Cornelia</b> <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Reduced verbalisation is also evident in this group when demands involving the initiation of speech are placed upon these individuals and this is related to impairments in both planning and working memory. A high rate of selective mutism is also characteristic of <b>Cornelia</b> <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Conclusion: The trajectory of both mood and sociability appears atypical in <b>Cornelia</b> <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Cognitive impairments may underpin these behavioural differences in adolescents and adults with the syndrome.

Over {{the past five}} years, a mild variant has been defined, with less significant psychomotor retardation, less marked pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, and an uncommon association with major malformations, although mild limb anomalies may be present. We have evaluated 43 subjects with <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> <b>syndrome,</b> 30 with classical features, aged from birth to 21 years, and 13 with the mild phenotype, aged from 18 months to 30 years. In addition to assessment of gestalt and facial change with time, detailed craniofacial measurements have been obtained on each subject and composite pattern profiles compiled. The characteristic face of classical <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> <b>syndrome</b> is present at birth and changes little throughout life, although there is some lengthening of the face with age and the jaw becomes squared. In mild <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the characteristic classical appearance may be present at birth, but in some subjects it may be {{two or three years}} before the typical face is obvious. In general, the overall impression is less striking, perhaps because of increased facial expression and greater alertness. With age, the face loses the characteristic appearance, the nasal height increases, the philtrum does not seem as long, and the upper vermilion is full and everted, although the crescent shaped mouth with downturned corners remains. Eyebrows may be full and bushy. Objective comparison of the face in mild and classical <b>de</b> <b>Lange</b> <b>syndrome,</b> through the use of craniofacial pattern profiles, shows marked similarity of patterns at 4 to 9 years; both groups have microbrachycephaly, but the individual dimensions of the mild group are slightly closer to normal than their classical counterparts.
