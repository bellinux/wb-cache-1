Time-dependent spin-resolved currents, occupations, spin accumulation, and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) are calculated using both nonequilibrium Green function and master equation techniques.

40|$|Research about {{renewable}} {{technologies for}} thermal energy collection is crucial when critical {{problems such as}} climate change, global warming or environmental pollution are concerned. Transforming solar energy into thermal energy by means of asphalt solar collectors might help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel consumption. In this paper, a laboratory-scale asphalt solar collector formed by different slabs has been characterized by applying numerical techniques. An experimental test where the thermal performance of the collector was determined for three values of heat exchange fluid flow rate was carried out for the validation of the numerical model. Then, the CFD model was used to analyse the thermal response of the collector according to the following parameters: flow rate, solar irradiance, size and thickness. Results show that increasing values of heat exchange fluid flow rate result in better thermal performances. Likewise, increasing values of irradiance {{and size of the}} <b>collector</b> <b>lead</b> to higher values of thermal performance, although other parameters should also be considered for the final design of the system. Finally, under the conditions here considered, the thickness of the collector {{turned out not to be}} as significant as expected in relation to its thermal response. The combination of experimental tests and CFD codes can be considered a powerful tool for the characterization of asphalt solar collectors without incurring significant costs related to experimental field tests.

40|$|Aim of {{this paper}} is a {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation of a domestic heating system with heat pump using solar thermal collectors as the only heat source. In the system described, the heat pump uses an ice-water tank as annual storage system taking advantage of the phase change at 0 Â°C. Energy is supplied to the storage system using low temperature solar thermal collectors. Low temperatures inside the solar <b>collector</b> <b>lead</b> to an increased annual yield. The thermal collectors {{can also be used to}} directly heat domestic hot water or to supply heat to the buildings heating system. Benefit of this system should be a significantly increased performance compared to a standard air to water heat pump while at the same time reducing its noise level. Additionally no drilling for geothermal probes is needed and no permission to use ground water is required. A theoretical model was built for this system and successfully validated using the field measurements. The field unit still had to fight several problems (evaporator too small, problems with control system) which lead to a very low overall seasonal efficiency of 1. 43. But the measurement results could still be used to validate the heat pump and building model. Starting from the lessons learnt in the field, the system was dimensioned correctly and simulated accordingly. The seasonal efficiency achieved in the simulation increased to 2. 4 which is comparable to air source heat pumps. It is expected that further modifications of the system could result in seasonal performance factors of 3. 0 - 4. 0. While this would be a fairly good performance and the noise pollution of the heat pump would be lower compared to air source heat pumps, the investment costs needed would grow considerably...|$|E

The overall amplifier consists of a 4 x 4 array of unit cells on an RT Duroidâ¢ board having a relative permittivity of 2. 2.

The polarizers serve dual functions, providing both input-output isolation as well as independent impedance matching for the input and output ports.

Extensive TEM and SEM analysis was utilized to detail the cycling induced morphology changes in both the Al-SiNW nanocomposites and in the baseline SiNWs. We observed an improved cycling performance in the Si nanowires that were coated with 3 and 8 wt. % aluminum. After 50 cycles, both the bare and the 3 wt. % Al coated nanowires retained 2600 mAh/g capacity. However beyond 50 cycles, the coated nanowires showed higher capacity as well as better capacity retention {{with respect to the}} first cycle. Our hypothesis is that the nanoscale yet continuous electrochemically active aluminum shell places the Si nanowires in compression, reducing the magnitude of their cracking/disintegration and the subsequent loss of electrical contact with the electrode. We combined impedance spectroscopy with microscopy analysis to demonstrate how the Al coating affects the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). A similar thickness alumina (Al 2 O 3) coating, grown via atomic layer deposition (ALD), was shown not to be as effective in reducing the long-term capacity loss.

The CSP plants studied herein use thermal oil as heat transfer fluid and as storage medium in a two-tank direct thermal storage system. The performance of the CSP plants were evaluated {{on the basis of}} a 1 MW ORC unit with a conversion efficiency of about 24 % and by considering different values of solar multiple and thermal storage capacity. The comparative performance analysis of the two CSP solutions was carried out with reference to the direct solar energy availability of Cagliari, Italy (1720 kWh/m 2 y) on a yearly basis by means of specifically developed simulation models. The results of the performance assessment demonstrate that CSP plants based on linear Fresnel <b>collectors</b> <b>lead</b> to higher values of electrical energy production per unit area of occupied land. The highest specific energy production of CSP plants based on linear Fresnel collectors is about 55 - 60 kWh/y per m 2 of occupied land and it is achieved with solar multiples in the 1. 74 - 2. 5 range and storage capacities in the range of 4 - 12 hours. The highest specific production of the solutions based on parabolic trough collectors is about 45 - 50 kWh/y per m 2 of occupied land and is achieved with lower solar multiples (around 1. 5 - 2. 3).
