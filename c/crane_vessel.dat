Facilities {{there had been}} {{upgraded}} in preparation for her, with eight new three-ton capacity electric cranes having been installed on the north quay of the King George V Dock. She left London on 17 February 1939, and made her first call at Southampton where she embarked passengers for Australia and New Zealand. She then called at Tenerife in the Canary Islands for bunkers, Cape Town and Durban in South Africa; and Fremantle, Melbourne, and Sydney in Australia. On 24 April 1939 she reached Wellington in New Zealand, where she had a slight collision with the <b>crane</b> <b>vessel</b> Hikitia. Dominion Monarch also visited Napier, New Zealand. Her voyage set more records, including fastest passage from Britain to Australia via the Cape of Good Hope, largest ship to serve Australia, and largest ship to serve New Zealand.

5000|$|The {{need for}} large stable <b>crane</b> <b>vessels</b> {{to operate in}} the North Sea {{environment}} lead the company to develop the first large semi-submersible <b>crane</b> <b>vessels.</b> In 1978, HMC commissioned Mitsui to construct the two sister semi-submersible <b>crane</b> <b>vessels,</b> [...] and SSCV Hermod. These vessel could lift 5,400 tonnes with the twin cranes, and were later upgraded to 8,200 tonnes.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} of the semi-submersible vessel stability were soon recognized for offshore construction when in 1978 Heerema Marine Contractors constructed the two sister <b>crane</b> <b>vessels</b> called Balder and Hermod. These semi-submersible <b>crane</b> <b>vessels</b> (SSCV) consist of two lower hulls (pontoons), three columns on each pontoon and an upper hull. Shortly after J. Ray McDermott and Saipem also introduced SSCVs, resulting in two new enormous vessels DB-102 (now Thialf) and Saipem 7000, capable of lifting respectively 14,200 and 14,000 tons.|$|R

50|$|The huge cost of {{a vessel}} of this size would be offset by the cost and time savings made by the oil company as the large {{integrated}} decks could be completed, tested and commissioned onshore. Prior {{to the introduction of}} the large <b>crane</b> <b>vessels</b> offshore oil platforms were made up of 1000 - 2000 tonne modules which were lifted into place individually by smaller SSCV's or monohull <b>crane</b> <b>vessels</b> and then connected together offshore, tested and then commissioned, this often took over a year. Other savings in the installation of the jackets could also be made.|$|R
