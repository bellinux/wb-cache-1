5|$|The {{frequency}} accuracy {{relative to the}} <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> is limited only by the precision of the arithmetic used to compute the phase. NCOs are phase- and frequency-agile, and can be trivially modified to produce a phase-modulated or frequency-modulated output by summation at the appropriate node, or provide quadrature outputs {{as shown in the}} figure.|$|E
5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime {{of a program}} {{is equal to the}} number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> decreases the average time it takes to execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to setting the <b>clock</b> <b>frequency,</b> the master must also configure the clock polarity and phase {{with respect to}} the data. Motorola SPI Block Guide names these two options as CPOL and CPHA respectively, and most vendors have adopted that convention.|$|E

25|$|Doing this in {{only two}} clock cycles {{requires}} careful coordination between the time the SDRAM takes to turn off its output on a clock edge and the time the data must be supplied as input to the SDRAM for the write on the following clock edge.

25|$|MVI's {{simplicity}} {{was due to}} two reasons. Firstly, Digital {{had determined}} that the Alpha 21164 was already capable of performing DVD decoding through software, therefore not requiring hardware provisions for the purpose, but was inefficient in MPEG-2 encoding. The second reason was the requirement to retain the fast cycle times of implementations. Adding many instructions would have complicated and enlarged the instruction decode logic, reducing an implementation's <b>clock</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most 32-bit PCI cards will {{function}} {{properly in}} 64-bit PCI-X slots, but the bus clock rate {{will be limited}} to the <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> of the slowest card, an inherent limitation of PCI's shared bus topology. For example, when a PCI 2.3, 66-MHz peripheral is installed into a PCI-X bus capable of 133MHz, the entire bus backplane {{will be limited to}} 66MHz. To get around this limitation, many motherboards have multiple PCI/PCI-X buses, with one bus intended for use with high-speed PCI-X peripherals, and the other bus intended for general-purpose peripherals.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{benefit of}} DDR3 SDRAM over its {{immediate}} predecessor, DDR2 SDRAM, {{is its ability}} to transfer data at twice the rate (eight times the speed of its internal memory arrays), enabling higher bandwidth or peak data rates. With two transfers per cycle of a quadrupled clock signal, a 64-bit wide DDR3 module may achieve a transfer rate (in megabytes per second, MB/s) of up to 64 times the memory clock speed (in MHz). With data being transferred 64 bits at a time per memory module, DDR3 SDRAM gives a transfer rate of (memory clock rate) × 4 (for bus clock multiplier) × 2 (for data rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus with a memory <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> of 100MHz, DDR3 SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 6400 MB/s.|$|E

25|$|The Nord-100 was {{introduced}} in 1979, which was specialized at flexibility and focused on administrative applications. When Digital launched their VAX-11 in 1977, Norsk Data had the Nord-5 32-bit computer ready for CERN. As the VAX-11 was 32-bit and regarded as a superminicomputer, Norsk Data did not initially {{see it as a}} competitor since the Nord-5 had much better processing power. Nord-50 had similar processing power to the Nord-5, but was not a general-purpose computer. The 32 bit computer used a Nord-10 front processor that ran the SINTRAN III operating system. Development of the ND-500 started in 1978 and had so fundamental changes to the system architecture (was not made from bit-slice components but microprammed with a new instruction set) that all software had to be rewritten - except for the SINTRAN. The computer was launched in 1981, but with fundamental shortcomings imposed by the OS It was much faster than the VAX, but did not meet the general customers' expectation of being a multi-purpose computer. Later models improved the performance and tweaking of the system allowed it to become a multipurpose system.at the performance of a special purpose super computer as sold by Cray. A major contract with the ND-500 was the Joint European Torus project, which took delivery of twenty-seven ND-100 and -500 units. Development of the ND-5000 started before the ND-500 was completed. The design was changed to become more modular; this increased the development costs, but reduced production costs and increased scalability. On the ND5000, components were placed in cards that were interconnected, initially to simplify cooling but also to enable the high <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> If an electric current is switched at a <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> of 1GHz, it travel about one foot per cycle, so 10cm is a delay of a clock cycle at 3GHz. The ND-500 computers had timing problems caused by wire-distance, and going faster just required everything to be close.|$|E
500|$|Another {{basic concept}} is the charge pump, {{a version of}} which is shown schematically in figure 6. [...] The charge pump capacitor, CP, is first charged to the input voltage. [...] It is then {{switched}} to charging the output capacitor, CO, in series with the input voltage resulting in CO eventually being charged to twice the input voltage. [...] It may take several cycles before the charge pump succeeds in fully charging CO but after steady state has been reached it is only necessary for CP to pump {{a small amount of}} charge equivalent to that being supplied to the load from CO. [...] While CO is disconnected from the charge pump it partially discharges into the load resulting in ripple on the output voltage. [...] This ripple is smaller for higher clock frequencies since the discharge time is shorter, and is also easier to filter. [...] Alternatively, the capacitors can be made smaller for a given ripple specification. [...] The practical maximum <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> in integrated circuits is typically in the hundreds of kilohertz.|$|E
2500|$|Compared {{to single}} data rate (SDR) SDRAM, the DDR SDRAM {{interface}} makes higher transfer rates possible by more strict {{control of the}} timing of the electrical data and clock signals. Implementations often have to use schemes such as phase-locked loops and self-calibration to reach the required timing accuracy. The interface uses double pumping (transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal) to double data bus bandwidth without a corresponding increase in <b>clock</b> <b>frequency.</b> One advantage of keeping the <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> down is that it reduces the signal integrity requirements on the circuit board connecting the memory to the controller. The name [...] "double data rate" [...] refers to the fact that a DDR SDRAM with a certain <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> achieves nearly twice the bandwidth of a SDR SDRAM running at the same <b>clock</b> <b>frequency,</b> due to this double pumping.|$|E

50|$|Testing for jitter and its {{measurement}} is {{of growing}} importance to electronics engineers {{because of increased}} <b>clock</b> <b>frequencies</b> in digital electronic circuitry to achieve higher device performance. Higher <b>clock</b> <b>frequencies</b> have commensurately smaller eye openings, and thus impose tighter tolerances on jitter. For example, modern computer motherboards have serial bus architectures with eye openings of 160 picoseconds or less. This is extremely small compared to parallel bus architectures with equivalent performance, which may have eye openings {{on the order of}} 1000 picoseconds.|$|R

2500|$|UHS-I: Specified in SD version 3.01, {{supports}} a <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> of 100MHz (a quadrupling {{of the original}} [...] "Default Speed"), which in four-bit transfer mode could transfer 50MB/s (SDR50). UHS-I cards declared as UHS104 (SDR104) also support a <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> of 208MHz, which could transfer 104MB/s. Double data rate operation at 50MHz (DDR50) is also specified in Version 3.01, and is mandatory for microSDHC and microSDXC cards labeled as UHS-I. In this mode, four bits are transferred when the clock signal rises and another four bits when it falls, transferring an entire byte on each full clock cycle, hence a 50MB/s operation could be transferred using a 50MHz clock.|$|E

2500|$|DDR (DDR1) was {{superseded}} by DDR2 SDRAM, which had modifications for higher <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> and again doubled throughput, but operates {{on the same}} principle as DDR.

[...] DDR2 was in turn {{superseded by}} DDR3 SDRAM which offered higher performance for increased bus speeds and new features. [...] DDR3 has been superseded by DDR4 SDRAM, which was first produced in 2011 and whose standards were still in flux (2012) with significant architectural changes.|$|E
2500|$|SLDRAM boasted higher {{performance}} and competed against RDRAM. It was {{developed during the}} late 1990s by the SLDRAM Consortium. The SLDRAM Consortium consisted of about 20 major DRAM and computer industry manufacturers. (The SLDRAM Consortium became incorporated as SLDRAM Inc. and then {{changed its name to}} Advanced Memory International, Inc.). SLDRAM was an open standard and did not require licensing fees. The specifications called for a 64-bit bus running at a 200, 300 or 400MHz <b>clock</b> <b>frequency.</b> This is achieved by all signals being on the same line and thereby avoiding the synchronization time of multiple lines. Like DDR SDRAM, SLDRAM uses a double-pumped bus, giving it an effective speed of 400, 600, or 800MT/s.|$|E
2500|$|In 1941, Zuse {{followed}} his earlier machine {{up with the}} Z3, the world's first working electromechanical programmable, fully automatic digital computer. [...] The Z3 was built with 2000 relays, implementing a 22bit word length that operated at a <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> of about 5–10Hz. Program code and data were stored on punched film. It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances such as floating point numbers. Replacement of the hard-to-implement decimal system (used in Charles Babbage's earlier design) by the simpler binary system meant that Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies available at that time. The Z3 was probably a complete Turing machine. In two 1936 patent applications, Zuse also anticipated that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data—the key insight of {{what became known as}} the von Neumann architecture, first implemented in the British SSEM of 1948.|$|E
