5|$|During the 11th {{century in}} the Song Dynasty, the Chinese astronomer, horologist and {{mechanical}} engineer Su Song created a water-driven astronomical clock for his clock tower of Kaifeng City.

5|$|Nevertheless, some Han {{literary}} sources provide crucial information. As {{written by}} Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, the belt drive {{was first used}} for a quilling device which wound silk fibers onto the bobbins of weaver shuttles. The invention of the belt drive was a crucial {{first step in the}} development of later technologies during the Song dynasty, such as the <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> and spinning wheel.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} region {{now known}} as China experienced a history involving mechanics, hydraulics and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, naval architecture and warfare. By the Warring States period (403–221 BC), inhabitants of the Warring States had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and cupola furnace, while the finery forge and puddling process were known by the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The invention of gunpowder during the mid 9th century led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, hand cannon, exploding cannonballs, multistage rocket and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads. With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st century sternpost rudder, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa. In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the escapement mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by paddle wheel boats.|$|E

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is twofold. First, it {{discusses}} how the functioning and performance of food chains are affected by the way stakeholders are embedded in the chains, by the coordination modes, and by the kind of governance. Second, by depicting six relevant agro-food chains, attention is raised on the kind of the stakeholders that participate in the chain and on the role of each with a special focus on possible drawbacks of an effective functioning of the supply chains. The chains outlined are (i) supply <b>chains</b> <b>driven</b> by a large retailer; (ii) supply <b>chains</b> <b>driven</b> by a global processing company; (iii) supply <b>chains</b> <b>driven</b> by a cooperative; (iv) supply chains for geographical indications; (v) short supply chains; and (vi) supply <b>chains</b> <b>driven</b> by a specialized high quality retailer.|$|R

25|$|The two-wheeled pedal powered bicycle {{was first}} {{conceived}} in Paris in the 1860s. By 1888 John Dunlop's pneumatic tire and the <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> {{made possible the}} safety bicycle, giving the bicycle its modern form.|$|E
25|$|From 1982 through 2003, {{with the}} {{exception}} of several years, Honda produced a CB750 known as the Nighthawk 750. Early models were designated the CB750SC Nighthawk while later models were simply known as the Nighthawk 750. The Nighthawk 750SC had a 4-stroke engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> and has front disc and rear drum brakes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> {{improved}} {{comfort and}} speed, as the drive {{was transferred to}} the non-steering rear wheel and allowed for smooth, relaxed and injury free pedaling (earlier designs that required pedalling the steering front wheel were difficult to pedal while turning, due to the misalignment of rotational planes of leg and pedal). With easier pedaling, the rider more easily turned corners.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, BMW {{introduced}} GS models {{powered by}} a single cylinder 4-valve 652cc Rotax engine, {{also known as a}} thumper, and <b>chain</b> <b>drive.</b> The off road-capable F650 Funduro had a 19inch front wheel, long travel suspension, bash plate, and a high seat. The more road biased F650ST Strada had a smaller diameter 18inch front wheel, narrower handlebars and smaller screen. The bikes were manufactured alongside the virtually identical 5-valve Aprilia Pegaso.|$|E
25|$|Steam engines {{had to be}} {{designed}} with the power delivered {{at the bottom of}} the machinery, to give direct drive to the propeller shaft. A paddle steamer's engines drive a shaft that is positioned above the waterline, with the cylinders positioned below the shaft. SS Great Britain used <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> to transmit power from a paddler's engine to the propeller shaft - the result of a late design change to propeller propulsion.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of gear change mechanisms, known as derailleurs and hub gears.

There are a few other relatively uncommon types of gear change mechanism which are briefly mentioned {{near the end of}} this section. Derailleur mechanisms can only be used with <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> transmissions, so bicycles with belt drive or shaft drive transmissions must either be single speed or use hub gears.|$|E

25|$|With a <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> transmission, a {{chainring}} {{attached to}} a crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) (cassette or freewheel). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).|$|E
25|$|The {{first car}} left {{the works in}} January 1897, fitted with a Panhard engine, {{followed}} in March by Daimler-engined cars. The first Coventry Daimler-engined product made its maiden run in March 1897. By mid-year they were producing three of their own cars a week and producing Léon Bollée cars under licence. Lawson claimed to have made 20 cars by July 1897 making the Daimler Britain's first motor car to go into serial production, an honour that is also credited to Humber Motors who had also displayed, but in their case their production models, at the Stanley Cycle Show in London in 1896. The Daimlers had a twin-cylinder, 1526cc engine, mounted {{at the front of}} the car, four-speed gearbox and <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> to the rear wheels.|$|E
25|$|Shorts {{airframe}} number S.39 {{was given}} to an experimental twin-engined aircraft based on the Type S.27, the Triple Twin. This was powered by two 50hp Gnome Omega engines, one {{in the front of}} the nacelle driving a pair of tractor propellers mounted on the interplane struts, with the <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> to the left-hand propeller crossed so that the front propellers revolved in opposite directions, and the second engine mounted behind the trailing edge of the lower wing driving a pusher propeller. As first built and flown the wings were of equal span, with trailing edge ailerons fitted to both upper and lower wings. It was first flown by McClean on 18 September 1911 and bought by the Admiralty in June 1912, being given the serial number T.3.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a three-bay biplane with a biplane elevator and central fin mounted on {{two pairs of}} converging booms in front. The chord of the outer bay of each wing was extended aft to form flexible extensions to effect lateral control: between the tips of these extensions, four balanced rudders were pivoted. The undercarriage consisted {{of a pair of}} ash skids extending forward, almost as far as the elevators. No wheels were fitted, as it was intended to use a launching rail for takeoff. Apart from the skids, the entire airframe was built of spruce, and was covered with Continental brand rubberised fabric. The engine, originally intended to be a version of the Wright's engine made by Bariquand et Marre, drove a pair of pusher propellers, mounted slightly above mid-gap using a <b>chain</b> <b>drive.</b> This was arranged so that both propellers revolved in the same direction, since crossing them to make them revolve in opposite directions might have infringed patents held by the Wright brothers.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} notable {{contributors}} {{to the field of}} Chinese science throughout the ages. One of the best examples would be Shen Kuo (1031–1095), a polymath scientist and statesman who was the first to describe the magnetic-needle compass used for navigation, discovered the concept of true north, improved the design of the astronomical gnomon, armillary sphere, sight tube, and clepsydra, and described the use of drydocks to repair boats. After observing the natural process of the inundation of silt and the find of marine fossils in the Taihang Mountains (hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean), Shen Kuo devised a theory of land formation, or geomorphology. He also adopted a theory of gradual climate change in regions over time, after observing petrified bamboo found underground at Yan'an, Shaanxi province. If not for Shen Kuo's writing, the architectural works of Yu Hao would be little known, along with the inventor of movable type printing, Bi Sheng (990-1051). Shen's contemporary Su Song (1020–1101) was also a brilliant polymath, an astronomer who created a celestial atlas of star maps, wrote a pharmaceutical treatise with related subjects of botany, zoology, mineralogy, and metallurgy, and had erected a large astronomical clocktower in Kaifeng city in 1088. To operate the crowning armillary sphere, his clocktower featured an escapement mechanism and the world's oldest known use of an endless power-transmitting <b>chain</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>drive,</b> endless power-transmitting: The Greek Philon of Byzantium (3rd or 2nd century BC) {{described}} a <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> and windlass {{used in the}} operation of a polybolos (a repeating ballista), [...] "but the <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> did not continuously transmit power from shaft to shaft and hence they were not in the direct line of ancestry of the chain-drive proper". A continuously driven <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> first appeared in 11th century China. Perhaps inspired by chain pumps which had been known in China since at least the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) when they were mentioned by the Chinese philosopher Wang Chong (27– c. 100 AD), the endless power-transmitting <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> was first used in the gearing of the clock tower built at Kaifeng in 1090 by the Song Chinese politician, mathematician and astronomer Su Song (1020–1101).|$|E
