40|$|This {{research}} {{is important to}} human being because a global reduction of CO 2 emissions {{is becoming more and}} more important to prevent global warming caused by green-house gas production. So, recycling of aluminium alloy scraps is important to reduce energy consumption and also a reduction of CO 2 emissions in manufacturing processes. The main purpose of this {{research is}} to determine the effect of Aluminium Alloy AA 6061 <b>chips</b> <b>sizes</b> and composition of polycarbonate on mechanical strength prepared by compaction process. Besides that, to investigate the effect of pressure and time compacted on mechanical properties. The research was conducted with different <b>chips</b> <b>size,</b> different composition of binder, different pressure and difference time throughout compacted process. Three difference <b>chips</b> <b>sizes</b> are selected which is 250, 500, and 710 μm, different pressure is 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2 tonne, meanwhile for different time compaction is 20, 30 and 40 minutes. From the result obtained, the highest strength showed by sample with <b>chips</b> <b>size</b> 250 μm and composition of polycarbonate 30 wt% with value 61. 185 MPa. Furthermore for higher hardness also at the lowest <b>chips</b> <b>size</b> 250 μm and higher composition of polycarbonate 30 wt% with 167. 752 HV. Meanwhile for the lowest values of strength and hardness are 6. 7894 MPa and 72. 2052 HV at <b>chips</b> <b>size</b> 710 μm and 10 wt% of polycarbonate. In this research, lower <b>chip</b> <b>sizes,</b> addition of composition polycarbonate, higher pressure and time compaction could improve the mechanical strength of Aluminium Alloy waste chips...|$|R

Three-dimensional finite element models are built to simulate the viscoplastic behaviors for various mold compounds and <b>chip</b> <b>sizes.</b> In particular, the bonding parts between a mold and silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) are carefully modeled, and the strain distributions are studied.

Through the numerical studies, it is found that type-C, which has a relatively lower Young's modulus and higher CTE, has a better fatigue life than the other mold compounds.

40|$|Mn-Zn(Manganese-Zinc) ferrite polycrystals {{have been}} widely used as a core {{material}} of magnetic heads in video cassette recorders or floppy disk drives of personal computers. In this research，slot grinding was performed to investigate the chipping generation mechanism at slot edge of Mn-Zn ferrite polycrystal with metal bonded diamond wheels. A high precision slicing machine with an air spindle of low friction and low thermal expansion was used. After grinding，the chippings at a slot edge was measured by means of a form tracer with a knife edge tip，and analyzed with a newly developed measurement method using a personal computer under various grinding conditions. On the other hand，by means of SEM observation，a material removal mechanism at the edge of Mn-Zn ferrite was investigated. The results are follows. Pre-process，such as lapping，before grinding can reduce <b>chipping</b> <b>size.</b> Most of <b>chipping</b> is generated by transgranular fracture.

40|$|The {{standard}} cell placement (SCP) {{problem is a}} well-studied placement problem, as {{it is an important}} step in the VLSI design process. In SCP, cells are placed on chip to optimize some objectives, such as wirelength or area. The SCP problem is solved using mainly four basic methods: simulated annealing, quadratic placement, min-cut placement, and force-directed placement. These methods are adequate for small <b>chip</b> <b>sizes.</b> Nowadays, <b>chip</b> <b>sizes</b> are very large, and hence, hybrid methods are employed to solve the SCP problem instead of the original methods by themselves. This paper presents a new hybrid method for the SCP problem using a swarm intelligence-based (SI) method, called SwarmRW (swarm random walk), on top of a min-cut based partitioner. The resulting placer, called sPL (swarm placer), was tested on the PEKU benchmark suite and compared with several related placers. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that sPL can achieve competitive performance...|$|R

In this study, <b>chips</b> of different <b>sizes</b> were impregnated with SO(2) and steam-pretreated.

Shorter impregnation times resulted in slightly lower mannose yields for the larger chips, probably due to poor diffusion of the catalyst.

50|$|Peddle {{continued}} {{working for}} Motorola while looking for investors {{for his new}} microprocessor concept. In August 1974 Chuck Peddle left Motorola and joined a small semiconductor company in Pennsylvania, MOS Technology. He was followed by seven other Motorola engineers: Harry Bawcum, Ray Hirt, Terry Holdt, Mike James, Will Mathis, Bill Mensch and Rod Orgill. Peddle's group at MOS Technology developed two new microprocessors that were compatible with the Motorola peripheral chips like the 6820 PIA. Rod Orgill designed the MCS6501 processor that would plug into a MC6800 socket and Bill Mensch did the MCS6502 that had the clock generation circuit on chip. These microprocessors would not run 6800 programs {{because they had a}} different architecture and instruction set. The major goal was a microprocessor that would sell for under $25. This would be done by removing non-essential features to reduce the <b>chip</b> <b>size.</b> An 8-bit stack pointer was used instead of a 16-bit one. The second accumulator was omitted. The address buffers did not have a three-state mode for Direct Memory Access (DMA) data transfers. The goal was to get the <b>chip</b> <b>size</b> down to 153 mils x 168 mils (3.9 mm x 4.3 mm).|$|E

50|$|Power {{dissipation}} is {{an important}} issue in present-day PCB design. Power dissipation will result in temperature difference and pose a thermal problem to a chip. In addition to the issue of reliability, excess heat will also negatively affect electrical performance and safety. The working temperature of an IC should therefore be kept below the maximum allowable limit of the worst case. In general, the temperatures of junction and ambient are 125 °C and 55 °C, respectively.The ever-shrinking <b>chip</b> <b>size</b> causes the heat to concentrate within a small area and leads to high power density. Furthermore, denser transistors gathering in a monolithic chip and higher operating frequency cause a worsening of the power dissipation.

50|$|The RSX 'Reality Synthesizer' {{is based}} on the G70 architecture, but {{features}} a few changes to the core. The biggest difference between the two chips is the way the memory bandwidth works. The G70 only supports rendering to local memory, while the RSX is able to render to both system and local memory. Since rendering from system memory has a much higher latency compared to rendering from local memory, the chip's architecture had to be modified to avoid a performance penalty. This was achieved by enlarging the <b>chip</b> <b>size</b> to accommodate larger buffers and caches {{in order to keep the}} graphics pipeline full. The result was that the RSX only has 60% of the local memory bandwidth of the G70, making it necessary for developers to use the system memory in order to achieve performance targets.|$|E
