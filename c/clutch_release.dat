5000|$|As {{engineered}} by Dante Giacosa, the 128 featured a transverse-mounted engine with unequal length drive shafts and an innovative <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> mechanism [...] - [...] an arrangement which Fiat had strategically tested {{on a previous}} production model for a full five years, the Primula from its less market-critical subsidiary, Autobianchi. The layout enabled the engine and gearbox to be located side by side without sharing lubricating fluid while orienting an electrically controlled cooling fan toward fresh air flow. By using the Primula as a test-bed, Fiat was able to sufficiently resolve the layout's disadvantages, including uneven side-to-side power transmission, uneven tire wear and potential torque steer, the tendency for {{the power of the}} engine alone to steer the car under heavy acceleration.|$|E
50|$|When the {{electromagnetic}} clutch {{is used in}} automobiles, {{there may be a}} <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> switch inside the gear lever. The driver operates the switch by holding the gear lever to change the gear, thus cutting off current to the electromagnet and disengaging the clutch. With this mechanism, {{there is no need to}} depress the clutch pedal. Alternatively, the switch may be replaced by a touch sensor or proximity sensor which senses the presence of the hand near the lever and cuts off the current. The advantages of using this type of clutch for automobiles are that complicated linkages are not required to actuate the clutch, and the driver needs to apply a considerably reduced force to operate the clutch. It is a type of semi-automatic transmission.|$|E

50|$|The SM465 {{features}} dual {{provisions for}} power take-offs. The 1988-91 versions have an aluminum top with improved shift feel. The 1986 pickup truck versions utilize a hydraulic <b>clutch</b> <b>release,</b> replacing a mechanical linkage in older versions. A common wear {{factor in the}} form of abuse leads to having to manually hold the gear selector in third. There have been three different output shafts for pickup trucks. Early four-wheel drive was a short 10 spline, late 4WD was long 32 spline, and all two-wheel drives were 35 spline. Early 4WDs came mated to New Process 205 transfer cases. The 1981 and later versions came with a New Process 208 if not a 205. New Process 241 was used behind the 465 starting in 1989 when it replaced the New Process 208 in the V-series trucks. The 465 was the only manual transmission available for V-series trucks (1987-1991).|$|E
50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} shafts - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the intermediate shaft. This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate shift fork shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear shafts. The shift forks are activated by a cable system. The <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> bearing is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and release bearing. The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|E
5000|$|A {{significant}} reason motorcycle drag racers lagged {{in implementing}} delay box electronics {{is due to}} the wide variety of driveline configurations on dragbikes. Of the successful bracket racing drag race cars, most had automatic transmissions equipped with transbrakes. Innovation quickly adapted the delay box to cars with dual line locks (devices which locked the brakes on all four wheels electrically), and manual transmissions {{with the use of a}} hydraulic throw out bearing to hold the clutch plates apart, and also adapted to dragbikes that used pneumatics or hydraulics to actuate the <b>clutch</b> <b>release,</b> or centrifugal dragbike clutches known as [...] "slider clutches" [...] that engage with the engine's revolutions per minute (RPM) increase. When using a delay box on a motorcycle with a slider clutch, the engine RPM is electronically controlled (capped) by an electronic rev limiter connected to a delay box. When the delay box times out, the engine is allowed to freely rev-up engaging the clutch and launching the motorcycle downtrack. As you can see, delay boxes can be used on both cars and motorcycles. A transmission brake is not required to use a delay box for drag racing. When racers were educated to this, and also shown ways to utilize delay boxes on motorcycles, there was some alleviation of the early controversy.|$|E

5000|$|However, only 13,000 units {{ever made}} it to Iraq, with the {{majority}} of the cars becoming taxis in Baghdad (once the cab-identifying orange paint was added to the front and rear fenders). With the remaining balance of about 12,500 additional Malibus either sitting on a dock in Halifax or awaiting port shipment in Oshawa, where they were built, the Iraqis suddenly cancelled the order in 1982. Excuses reportedly included various [...] "quality concerns", including the inability of the local drivers to shift the finicky Saginaw manual transmission.

Later speculation was that the Iraqis were actually forced to back out for financial reasons, due to their escalating hostilities with Iran requiring the immediate diversion of funds to support the Iraqi war effort. Then GM of Canada President Donald Hackworth was initially quoted as stating GMCL intended to still try to sell the Malibus overseas in other Middle East markets; however in the end, the orphaned [...] "Iraqi Taxi" [...] Malibus were all sold to the Canadian public at the greatly reduced price of about C$6,800.

Fatigue life analysis {{is based on}} the release bearing rings or rolling body began to appear fatigue spalling, in which this kind of phenomenon is under cyclic stress. The contact stress distribution is not uniform, the contact stress is mainly concentrated near the surface; influenced by the geometry and physical properties and lubrication of the surface significantly. Contact between the two types of fatigue crack extension methods: fatigue crack surface under expansion and surface fatigue crack propagation. The surface crack growth mainly originated from two kinds of cases: crack caused by surface pre crack and contact between the two surface asperity each other.

40|$|Abstract: A typical {{clutch system}} for {{automotive}} manual transmissions transfers hydraulic pressure generated by driver's pedal manipulation to the clutch diaphragm spring. The foot effort history {{during the period}} of push is different than the period of the clutch pedalâ€™s return. The effort or load difference is called clutch foot effort hysteresis. It is known that the hysteresis is caused by friction. The frictional force and moment are produced between various component contact points such as between the rubber seal and the inner wall inside the hydraulic cylinder and between the diaphragm spring and the pressure plate, etc. Understanding the clutch pedal foot effort hysteresis is essential for a <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> system design and analysis. The dynamic model for a <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> system is developed for the foot effort hysteresis prediction and a simulation analysis is performed to propose a tool for analysing a clutch system...|$|E
