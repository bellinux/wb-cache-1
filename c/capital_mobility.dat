5|$|A {{study of}} central bank {{interventions}} on the US dollar and Deutsche mark found only limited {{evidence of any}} substantial effect on deviations from UIRP. UIRP {{has been found to}} hold over very small spans of time (covering only a number of hours) with a high frequency of bilateral exchange rate data. Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional regime changes, using monthly exchange rate data for the US dollar versus the Deutsche mark and the Spanish peseta versus the British pound, have found some evidence that UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile, and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and began liberalizing <b>capital</b> <b>mobility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given <b>capital</b> <b>mobility</b> and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected to}} hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets. That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E
5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term <b>capital</b> <b>mobility</b> only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the paper}} is to {{understand}} if the construction of <b>mobility</b> <b>capitals,</b> as shaped by planning actions, could be introduced in planning practice and if it could contribute to the orientation of individual and collective travel behaviours towards more sustainable <b>mobility</b> practices. <b>Mobility</b> <b>capitals,</b> that can be framed as the opportunities {{in the field of}} movement which are available to individuals, are introduced as a key concept to associate individual aspirations and their reflection on mobility practices, focusing on how individuals differently appropriate the opportunities of movement. Consequently, the potential significance of <b>mobility</b> <b>capitals</b> for <b>mobility</b> planning is discussed through various examples, referred in particular to the now spreading Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans – a planning tool developed at the European level – which seem to contribute to the construction of <b>mobility</b> <b>capitals</b> with different styles of mobility governance...|$|R
40|$|The {{swing in}} favour of markets {{weakened}} regulation, created incentives for excessive risk-taking, and reduced transparency and diversity. As a result, financial markets became more pro-cyclical. The right combination of regulation and markets is required to reverse this.

Central Bank accommodation has been blamed for the crisis, but excessive leverage due to lax regulation was of a much greater magnitude than any monetary imbalance. <b>Capital's</b> <b>mobility</b> and arbitrage in response to regulation, implies changes must be adopted globally.

5|$|In February 1992, European Union {{countries}} {{signed the}} Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing <b>capital</b> <b>mobility</b> and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the European Monetary Institute which was ultimately dissolved {{in tandem with}} the establishment in 1998 of the European Central Bank (ECB) and European System of Central Banks. Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the Euro, adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they disaggregated their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, exchangeable for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. , the EMU comprises 17 nations which have issued the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states.|$|E
5|$|RIRP {{rests on}} several assumptions, {{including}} efficient markets, no country risk premia, and zero {{change in the}} expected real exchange rate. The parity condition suggests that real interest rates will equalize between countries and that <b>capital</b> <b>mobility</b> will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for arbitrage. There exists strong evidence that RIRP holds tightly among emerging markets in Asia and also Japan. The half-life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months, but between two and three months for certain countries. Such variation in the half-lives of deviations may be reflective of differences {{in the degree of}} financial integration among the country groups analyzed. RIRP does not hold over short time horizons, but empirical evidence has demonstrated that it generally holds well across long time horizons of five to ten years.|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are <b>capital</b> <b>mobility</b> and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E

40|$|In the North of Europe, club {{membership}} {{is higher than}} in the South, but the frequency of contacts with friends, relatives and neighbors is lower. We link this fact to another one: the low geographical mobility rates in the South of Europe relative to the North. To interpret these facts, we build a model of local social <b>capital</b> and <b>mobility.</b> Investing in local ties is rational when workers do not expect to move to another region. We find that observationally close individuals may take different paths characterized by high local social <b>capital,</b> low <b>mobility</b> and high unemployment, vs. low social capital, high propensity to move and higher employment probability. Employment protection reinforces the accumulation of local social capital and thus reduces mobility. European data supports the theory: within a country and at the individual level, more social capital is associated with lower mobility. ...|$|R
5|$|As the {{inception}} of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained cognizant {{of the effects of the}} Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar. Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. <b>Capital</b> <b>mobility</b> faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited <b>capital</b> <b>mobility</b> and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E

500|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity (CIRP) {{is found to}} hold when there is open <b>capital</b> <b>mobility</b> and limited capital controls, and this finding is confirmed for all currencies freely traded in the present day. One such example is when the United Kingdom and Germany abolished capital controls between 1979 and 1981. Maurice Obstfeld and Alan Taylor calculated hypothetical profits as implied by {{the expression of a}} potential inequality in the CIRP equation (meaning a difference in returns on domestic versus foreign assets) during the 1960s and 1970s, which would have constituted arbitrage opportunities if not for the prevalence of capital controls. However, given financial liberalization and resulting <b>capital</b> <b>mobility,</b> arbitrage temporarily became possible until equilibrium was restored. Since the abolition of capital controls in the United Kingdom and Germany, potential arbitrage profits have been near zero. Factoring in transaction costs arising from fees and other regulations, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting or nonexistent when such costs exceed deviations from parity. While CIRP generally holds, it does not hold with precision due to the presence of transaction costs, political risks, tax implications for interest earnings versus gains from foreign exchange, and differences in the liquidity of domestic versus foreign assets.|$|E
