5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E

25|$|The VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, {{conducted}} by Bombardier, et al., which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen, had {{indicated a significant}} 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over the 12-month span of the study. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There {{was no significant difference}} in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. those meeting the criteria for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis of secondary cardiovascular events (previous myocardial infarction, angina, <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident,</b> transient ischemic attack, or coronary artery bypass).|$|E

2500|$|The term <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> was {{introduced}} in 1927, reflecting a [...] "growing awareness and acceptance of vascular theories and (...) recognition {{of the consequences of}} a sudden disruption in the vascular supply of the brain". Its use is now discouraged by a number of neurology textbooks, reasoning that the connotation of fortuitousness carried by the word accident insufficiently highlights the modifiability of the underlying risk factors. Cerebrovascular insult may be used interchangeably.|$|E
2500|$|Venous {{thrombus}} (clots in the veins) {{are quite}} common. [...] Embolizations (dislodgement of thrombi) normally {{go to the}} lung and cause pulmonary emboli. [...] In an individual with ASD, these emboli can potentially enter the arterial system, which can cause any phenomenon attributed to acute loss of blood to {{a portion of the}} body, including <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> (stroke), infarction of the spleen or intestines, or even a distal extremity (i.e., finger or toe).|$|E

2500|$|Retrograde amnesia is {{inability}} to recall memories before onset of amnesia. One {{may be able}} to encode new memories after the incident. Retrograde is usually caused by head trauma or brain damage to parts of the brain besides the hippocampus. The hippocampus is responsible for encoding new memory. Episodic memory {{is more likely to be}} affected than semantic memory. The damage is usually caused by head trauma, <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident,</b> stroke, tumor, hypoxia, encephalitis, or chronic alcoholism. [...] People suffering from retrograde amnesia are more likely to remember general knowledge rather than specifics. Recent memories are less likely to be recovered, but older memories will be easier to recall due to strengthening over time. Retrograde amnesia is usually temporary and can be treated by exposing them to memories from the loss. Another type of consolidation (process by which memories become stable in the brain) occurs over much longer periods of time/days, weeks, months and years and likely involves transfer of information from the hippocampus to more permanent storage site in the cortex. The operation of this longer-term consolidation process is seen in the retrograde amnesia of patients with hippocampal damage who can recall memories from childhood relatively normally, but are impaired when recalling experiences that occurred just a few years prior to the time they became amnesic.

2500|$|The {{structural}} and functional diversity of calpains {{in the cell}} is reflected in their involvement in the pathogenesis {{of a wide range}} of disorders. At least two well known genetic disorders and one form of cancer have been linked to tissue-specific calpains. When defective, the mammalian calpain 3 (also known as p94) is the gene product responsible for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A, calpain 10 has been identified as a susceptibility gene for type II diabetes mellitus, and calpain 9 has been identified as a tumour suppressor for gastric cancer. Moreover, the hyperactivation of calpains is implicated in a number of pathologies associated with altered calcium homeostasis such as Alzheimer's disease, and cataract formation, as well as secondary degeneration resulting from acute cellular stress following myocardial ischemia, cerebral (neuronal) ischemia, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury. Excessive amounts of calpain can be activated due to Ca2+ influx after <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> (during the ischemic cascade) or some types of traumatic brain injury such as diffuse axonal injury. Increase in concentration of calcium in the cell results in calpain activation, which leads to unregulated proteolysis of both target and non-target proteins and consequent irreversible tissue damage. Excessively active calpain breaks down molecules in the cytoskeleton such as spectrin, microtubule subunits, microtubule-associated proteins, and neurofilaments.-dependent mechanisms of cell injury in cultured cortical neurons |journal=Neuroscience |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=1133â€“44 |date=October 1998 |pmid=9697120}} [...] It may also damage ion channels, other enzymes, cell adhesion molecules, and cell surface receptors. This can lead to degradation of the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane. [...] Calpain may also break down sodium channels that have been damaged due to axonal stretch injury, leading to an influx of sodium into the cell. [...] This, in turn, leads to the neuron's depolarization and the influx of more Ca2+. A significant consequence of calpain activation is the development of cardiac contractile dysfunction that follows ischemic insult to the heart. Upon reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium, there is development of calcium overload or excess in the heart cell (cardiomyocytes). This increase in calcium leads to activation of calpain.|$|E

40|$|This randomized, {{double-blind}} study on 79 patients reported {{the efficacy of}} ticlopidine- pentoxifylline combination {{in the treatment of}} atherosclerosis and the prevention of <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accidents.</b> Comparisons were made with aspirin- dipyridamole- buflomedil and buflomedil- placebo combinations as controls. Global symptoms, sensorimotor disorders and vertigo were improved in all treatment groups, although improvement tended to be more pronounced with ticlopidine- pentoxifylline. None of the groups showed any change in stenosis or vessel wall rigidity although ticlopidine- pentoxifylline reduced flow irregularity. This combination therapy also normalized the direction of flow in the ophthalmic artery in 46. 2 % of patients with retrograde flow prior to treatment, compared with 30. 0 % following aspirin- dipyridamole- buflomedil and 28. 6 % following buflomedil- placebo administration. Significantly fewer cerebro-vascular accidents occurred after treatment with ticlopidine- pentoxi-fylline. In conclusion, ticlopidine-pentoxifylline showed good therapeutic efficacy against atherosclerosis and a preventative effect against new <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accidents.</b> This therapy was well tolerated.

40|$|Treatment {{with small}} {{molecule}} tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has improved survival in many cancers, yet {{has been associated}} with an increased risk of adverse events. Warnings of cardiovascular events are common in drug labels of many TKIs. Despite these warnings, cardiovascular toxicity of patients treated with TKIs remains unclear. Here, we evaluate the cardiovascular outcomes of advanced cancer patients treated with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A population based cohort study was undertaken involving adults aged > 18 years in Ontario, Canada, diagnosed with any advanced malignancy between 2006 and 2012. Data were extracted from linked administrative governmental databases. Adults with advanced cancer receiving TKIs were identified and followed throughout the time period. The main outcomes of interest were rates of hospitalization for ischemic heart disease (acute myocardial infarction and angina) or <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accidents</b> and death. 1642 patients {{with a mean age of}} 62. 5 years were studied; 1046 were treated with erlotinib, 166 with sorafenib and 430 with sunitinib. Over the 380 day median follow-up period (range 6 - 1970 days), 1. 1 % of all patients had ischemic heart events, 0. 7 % had <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accidents</b> and 72. 1 % died. Rates of cardiovascular events were similar to age and gender-matched individuals without cancer. In a subgroup analysis of treatment patients with a prior history of ischemic heart disease, 3. 3 % had ischemic heart events while 1. 2 % had <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accidents.</b> TKIs do not appear to increase the cause-specific hazard of ischemic heart disease and <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accidents</b> compared to age and gender-matched individuals without advanced cancer...|$|R
