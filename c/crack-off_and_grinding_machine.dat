50|$|The {{wire-cut}} type {{of machine}} {{arose in the}} 1960s {{for the purpose of}} making tools (dies) from hardened steel. The tool electrode in wire EDM is simply a wire. To avoid the erosion of material from the wire causing it to break, the wire is wound between two spools so that the active part of the wire is constantly changing. The earliest numerical controlled (NC) machines were conversions of punched-tape vertical milling machines. The first commercially available NC machine built as a wire-cut EDM machine was manufactured in the USSR in 1967. Machines that could optically follow lines on a master drawing were developed by David H. Dulebohn's group in the 1960s at Andrew Engineering Company for milling <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>machines.</b> Master drawings were later produced by computer numerical controlled (CNC) plotters for greater accuracy. A wire-cut EDM machine using the CNC drawing plotter and optical line follower techniques was produced in 1974. Dulebohn later used the same plotter CNC program to directly control the EDM machine, and the first CNC EDM machine was produced in 1976.|$|R
5000|$|Planers and shapers are now , {{because other}} machine tools (such as milling <b>machines,</b> {{broaching}} <b>machines,</b> <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>machines)</b> have mostly eclipsed them as the tools of choice for doing such work. However, {{they have not yet}} disappeared from the metalworking world. Planers are used by smaller tool and die shops within larger production facilities to maintain and repair large stamping dies and plastic injection molds. Additional uses include any other task where an abnormally large (usually in the range of 4'×8' or more) block of metal must be squared when a (quite massive) horizontal grinder or floor mill is unavailable, too expensive, or otherwise impractical in a given situation. As usual in the selection of machine tools, an old machine that is in hand, still works, and is long since paid-for has substantial cost advantage over a newer machine that would need to be purchased. This principle easily explains why [...] "old-fashioned" [...] techniques often have a long period of gradual obsolescence in industrial contexts, rather than a sharp drop-off of prevalence such as is seen in mass-consumer technology fashions.|$|R

50|$|The path of {{the stone}} {{is not the only}} {{difference}} between <b>grinding</b> <b>and</b> honing <b>machines,</b> they also differ in the stiffness of their construction. Honing machines are much more compliant than grinders. The purpose of grinding is to achieve a tight size tolerance. To do this, the grinding wheel must be moved to an exact position relative to the workpiece. Therefore, a <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> must be very stiff and its axes must move with very high precision.|$|R

Broadheath's industrial area, covering about , was founded in 1885 by Harry Grey, 8th Earl of Stamford, to attract businesses.

By 1914, 14companies operated in Broadheath, employing thousands of workers. One of those was the Budenberg Gauge Company. Linotype also created 172workers' homes near its factory, helping cater for the population boom created by Broadheath's industrialisation.
