However, nothing is yet known about the genetic basis of dioxane metabolism. In this study, we used a microarray to study differential expression of genes in strain CB 1190 grown on dioxane, glycolate (a previously identified intermediate of dioxane degradation), or pyruvate. Of eight multicomponent monooxygenase gene clusters carried by the strain CB 1190 genome, only the monooxygenase gene cluster located on plasmid pPSED 02 was upregulated with dioxane relative to pyruvate. Plasmid-borne genes for putative aldehyde dehydrogenases, an aldehyde reductase, and an alcohol oxidoreductase were also induced during growth with dioxane. With both dioxane and glycolate, a chromosomal gene cluster encoding a putative glycolate oxidase was upregulated, as were chromosomal genes related to glyoxylate metabolism through the glyoxylate <b>carboligase</b> pathway. Glyoxylate <b>carboligase</b> activity in cell extracts from cells pregrown with dioxane and in Rhodococcus jostii strain RHA 1 cells expressing the putative strain CB 1190 glyoxylate <b>carboligase</b> gene further demonstrated the role of glyoxylate metabolism in the degradation of dioxane. Finally, we used 13 C-labeled dioxane amino acid isotopomer analysis to provide additional evidence that metabolites of dioxane enter central metabolism as three-carbon compounds, likely as phosphoglycerate.

Mutant strains unable to form malate synthase G were unimpaired in their ability to oxidize glyoxylate. Hence, the dicarboxylic acid cycle does not appear to play an essential role in this process. Organisms blocked in the synthesis of glyoxylate <b>carboligase</b> did not oxidize glyoxylate at a detectable rate, indicating that wild-type organisms convert glyoxylate to acetyl-coenzyme A and oxidize it via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The foregoing evidence indicates that malate synthase G plays an anaplerotic role during growth with glycolate or acetate as the carbon source. The in vivo activity of malate synthase G was not detectable when the intracellular concentration of acetyl-coenzyme A was low, suggesting that this substrate or a closely related metabolite exerts a sensitive positive control over the enzyme.

The liberated ammonia is re-assimilated, but up to 25 % of the carbon may be released into the atmosphere as CO 2. Because {{of the loss of}} CO 2 and high energy costs, there has been considerable interest in attempts to decrease the flux through the cycle in C 3 plants. Transgenic tobacco plants were generated that contained the genes gcl and hyi from E. coli encoding glyoxylate <b>carboligase</b> (EC 4. 1. 1. 47) and hydroxypyruvate isomerase (EC 5. 3. 1. 22) respectively, targeted to the peroxisomes. It was presumed that the two enzymes could work together and compete with the aminotransferases that convert glyoxylate to glycine, thus avoiding ammonia production in the photorespiratory {{nitrogen cycle}}. Results When grown in ambient air, but not in elevated CO 2, the transgenic tobacco lines had a distinctive phenotype of necrotic lesions on the leaves. Three of the six lines chosen for a detailed study contained single copies of the gcl gene, two contained single copies of both the gcl and hyi genes and one line contained multiple copies of both gcl and hyi genes. The gcl protein was detected in the five transgenic lines containing single copies of the gcl gene but hyi protein was not detected in any of the transgenic lines. The content of soluble amino acids including glycine and serine, was generally increased in the transgenic lines growing in air, when compared to the wild type.

40|$|The enzymatic {{production}} of R-phenylacetylcarbinol (R-PAC), with either whole cells or partially purified pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) as the biocatalyst, requires high PDC activity and an inexpensive source of pyruvate for an economical feasible biotransformation process. Microbial pyruvate {{produced by a}} vitamin auxotrophic strain of Candida glabrata was selected as a potential substrate for biotransformation. With an optimal thiamine concentration of 60 µg/l, a pyruvic acid concentration of 43 g/l and yield of 0. 42 g/g glucose consumed were obtained. Using microbially-produced unpurified pyruvate resulted in similar PAC concentrations to those with commercial pure substrate confirming its potential for enzymatic PAC production. To obtain high activity yeast PDC, Candida utilis was cultivated in a controlled bioreactor. Optimal conditions for PDC production were identified as: fermentative cell growth at initial pH at 6. 0 followed by pH downshift to 3. 0. Average specific PDC <b>carboligase</b> activity of 392 ± 20 U/g DCW was achieved representing a 2. 7 -fold increase when compared to a constant pH process. A mechanism {{was proposed in which}} the cells adapted to the pH decrease by increasing PDC activity to convert the accumulated internal pyruvic acid via acetaldehyde to ethanol thereby reducing intracellular acidification. The effect of pH shift on specific PDC activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae achieved a comparable increase of specific PDC <b>carboligase</b> activity to 335 U/g DCW. The effect of pyruvic acid at pH 3. 0 on induction of PDC activity was confirmed by cultivation at pH 3 with added pyruvic acid. Using microarray techniques, genome-wide transcriptional analyses of the effect of pH shift on S. cerevisiae revealed a transient increased expression of PDC 1 after pH shift, which corresponded to the increase in specific PDC activity (although the latter was sustained for a longer period). The results showed significant gene responses to the pH shift with approximately 39 % of the yeast genome involved. The induced transcriptional responses to the pH shift were distinctive and showed only limited resemblance to gene responses reported for other environmental stress conditions, namely increased temperature, oxidative conditions, reduced pH (succinic acid), alkaline pH and increased osmolarity...|$|E

On {{the basis of}} the crystal structure of ApPDC, which was determined to a resolution of 2. 75 angstrom, and biochemical data, we mapped the active site. This enabled us to design variants with tailor-made catalytic activities by modifications of the residues E 469 and W 388. Although the exchange of W 388 by smaller amino acids yields variants with higher <b>carboligase</b> activity due to an increased access to the active site, the exchange of E 469 to glycine opens the so-called S-pocket in ApPDC for aromatic aldehydes and thus alters the stereoselectivity. The variant ApPDC-E 469 G provides access to (S) -phenylacetylcarbinol derivatives by enzymatic carboligation with a good stereoselectivity of up to 89 % enantiomeric excess. The variant nicely complements the tool-box of ThDP-dependent enzymes, which now gives access to all stereo-and regioisomers of the asymmetric aliphatic-aromatic cross-benzoin-like condensation.

Phenotypic complementation of mutations in the other two genes of the glycerate pathway, encoding tartronic semialdehyde reductase (glxR) and glycerate kinase (glxK), allowed us to clone and map them closely linked to gcl. Complete sequencing of a 15. 8 -kb fragment encompassing these genes defined a regulon with 12 open reading frames (ORFs).

Three enzymatic activities are required: Glycolate dehydrogenase (GDH), Glyoxylate <b>carboligase</b> (GCL), and Tratronic semialdehyde reductase (TSR). In order to establish the pathway in the chloroplast of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), all necessary genes were cloned in both prokaryotic and plant expression vectors in N-terminal translational fusion to a His-tag. The genes were first expressed in bacteria and the enzymatic activity of the constructs was shown. Transgenic tobacco plants were created containing all genes necessary for the proposed pathway by plastdial as well as nuclear transformation. Plastidial transformation was done by constructing a single polycistronic operon with five open reading frames. Nuclear transformation was performed by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of single or double constructs. Plastid transformants were checked by southern blot analysis. Many transgenic plants with a variable size of shortened transgenic sequences were detected. Moreover, many of the transgenic plants also displayed drastic chlorosis and stunted growth. However, few plants showed integration of the complete operon and the next generation of those plants is currently analysed. Initially, transgenic plants containing TSR and GCL were created by nuclear transformation {{due to the lack of}} a suitable glycolate oxidising enzyme. Variable amounts of foreign proteins were detected in Western blots. Enzymatic assays showed that the proteins are active in planta. However transgenic plants containing GCL protein again showed a chlorotic phenotype. A putative open reading frame was identified in the Arabidopsis genome sequence with homology to glycolate-oxidizing enzymes. The open reading frame was cloned and expressed in bacteria. Enzymatic assays and complementation tests showed that the protein is indeed a glycolate dehydrogenase.

In the present study, an alternative biochemical pathway for the metabolism of glycolate was established in the chloroplasts of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants. The new pathway aims at increasing the refixation of CO 2 inside the chloroplasts and thereby at suppressing photorespiration in C 3 plants. The pathway is derived from E. coli and converts the glycolate formed during photorespiration into glycerate. Three enzymatic activities are required: glycolate dehydrogenase (GDH), glyoxylate <b>carboligase</b> (GCL), and tartronic semialdehyde reductase (TSR). Instead of E. coli GDH, the glycolate dehydrogenase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtGDH) was used. Transgenic N. tabacum plants containing the necessary genes were generated. The expression level of the transgenes was analyzed by RT-PCR and the respective enzymatic activity assays showed that the proteins are active in planta. Various physiological, biochemical and photosynthetic measurements were performed under ambient and enhanced photorespiratory conditions to evaluate the impact of the established pathway in planta. By measuring the postillumination burst (PIB), a clear reduction in photorespiration was determined in plants transgenic for AtGDH. A further reduction of the photorespiratory flow was observed when all the transgenes were expressed in one plant (GTA). Additionally, the establishment of the bacterial glycolate pathway in plant chloroplasts results in a decrease of the CO 2 compensation point (Gamma). The CO 2 assimilation rates in transgenic plants were enhanced under photorespiratory conditions. Moreover, leaves of transgenic plants expressing the glycolate pathway showed higher glucose and fructose, end products of photosynthesis. Leaf fresh and dry weight measurements revealed that total plant productivity might be enhanced. Most of the above described effects were also observed in plants that overexpressed glycolate dehydrogenase alone.

A relatively high specific PDC activity (328 U decarboxylase g- 1 mycelium) was achieved when aeration/agitation were reduced significantly in the latter stages of cultivation. The stability of partially purified PDC and crude extract from R. javanicus were evaluated by examining the enzyme deactivation kinetic in various conditions. R. javanicus PDC was less stable than Candida utilis PDC currently used in our group. A kinetic model for the deactivation of partially purified PDC extracted from C. utilis by benzaldehyde (0 ? 00 mM) in 2. 5 M MOPS buffer has been developed. An initial lag period prior to deactivation was found to occur, with first order dependencies of PDC deactivation on exposure time and on benzaldehyde concentration. A mathematical model for the enzymatic biotransformation of PAC and its associated by-products has been developed using a schematic method devised by King and Altman (1956) for deriving the rate equations. The rate equations for substrates, product and by-products have been derived from the patterns for yeast PDC and combined with a deactivation model for PDC from C. utilis. Initial rate and biotransformation studies were applied to refine and validate a mathematical model for PAC production. The rate of PAC formation was directly proportional to the enzyme activity level up to 5. 0 U <b>carboligase</b> ml- 1. Michaelis-Menten kinetics were determined for the effect of pyruvate concentration on the reaction rate. The effect of benzaldehyde on the rate of PAC production followed the sigmoidal shape of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model. The biotransformation model, which also included a term for PDC inactivation by benzaldehyde, was used to determine the overall rate constants for the formation of PAC, acetaldehyde and acetoin. Implementation of digital pH control for PAC production in a well-stirred organic-aqueous two-phase biotransformation system with 20 mM MOPS and 2. 5 M dipropylene glycol (DPG) in aqueous phase resulted in similar level of PAC production [1. 01 M (151 g l- 1) in an organic phase and 115 mM (17. 2 g l- 1) in an aqueous phase after 47 h] to the system with a more expensive 2. 5 M MOPS buffer...|$|E
40|$|Next-generation {{sequencing}} (NGS) {{also known}} as high throughput sequencing is now fast and cheap enough to be {{considered part of the}} toolbox for investigating the unknown virus. Illumina Genome Analyzer is one of the developed next-generation sequencing platforms that produce a significant larger volume of sequence data. The short sequence reads generated from Illumina Genome Analyzer can be used to perform de novo assembly. Therefore, this study was conducted to perform de novo assembly of an unknown geminivirus using the sequence reads generated from Illumina Genome Analyzer. In this study, the de novo assembly was carried out using SOAPdenovo and it indicates that only one scaffold (C 11095) that mapped into the geminivirus genomes. After the scaffold output was obtained, the gene was predicted using GeneMark. hmm. There were 5 open reading frames (ORFs) predicted as gene. The function of each predicted gene was annotated using three different annotation tools, InterPro, Gene Ontology (GO) and UniProt. For example, from the InterPro result, the gene 1 encodes the geminivirus AL 3 coat protein, while the UniProt result shows that the gene 1 encodes the replication enhancement protein and the GO shows that the gene 1 was involved in the viral process (biological process). In this study, the predictive genes were compared with the geminivirus genomes using BRIG (BLAST Ring Image Generator). The BRIG image shows that the large sequence of the unknown geminivirus was missing between 1000 bp until 1300 bp. From the genes comparison result, it indicates the similarity between the unknown geminivirus and the geminivirus genomes where all the geminiviruses encode the coat protein and replication-associated protein. The differences between the unknown geminivirus and the geminivirus genomes were the unknown geminivirus encodes the replication enhancement protein (gene 1), the hypothetical protein (gene 3) and the glyoxylate <b>carboligase</b> (gene 5). The phylogenetic result shows that the geminiviruses can be classified into the East Asia (China, Taiwan, and Japan) and the Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam) viruses. The unknown geminivirus (candidate virus) was located in the Southeast Asia group. This phylogenetic tree indicates that the unknown geminivirus share common ancestor with Tobacco leaf curl Indonesia virus C 1, V 2, V 1 genes for replication-associated protein, putative V 2 protein, coat protein, partial and complete cds. The results of the phylogenetic tree suggest that the unknown geminivirus could be a Southeast Asia strain and it could be attack tobacco plants. The main point of this study was carried out to show the process in identifying an unknown sequence reads generated from Illumina Genome Analyzer...|$|E
40|$|Metabolism of glycolate via the photorespiratory pathway in C 3 plants consumes {{not only}} ATP and {{reducing}} equivalents but results also in approximately 25 % {{loss of the}} carbon from glycolate. In the present study, a novel biochemical pathway for the metabolism of glycolate {{was established in the}} chloroplast of Arabidopsis thaliana plants. The new pathway aims to increase the CO 2 concentration in the vicinity of Rubisco thereby suppressing photorespiration in C 3 plants. The pathway is derived from E. coli and converts the glycolate formed during photorespiration into glycerate. Three enzymatic activities are required: glycolate dehydrogenase (GDH), glyoxylate <b>carboligase</b> (GCL), and tartronic semialdehyde reductase (TSR). The minimal E. coli glycolate dehydrogenase enzyme is formed from three different polypeptides. As an alternative, a glycolate dehydrogenase (AtGDH) derived from A. thaliana was used. Transgenic A. thaliana plants containing the necessary genes for the novel pathway were generated. Variable amounts of foreign proteins as well as RNA were detected by Western blot and RT-PCR, respectively. Enzymatic assays showed that the proteins are active in planta. Biochemical, physiological and biophysical analyses were performed under ambient and enhanced photorespiratory conditions using different transgenic lines for evaluating the impact of the novel pathway in planta. By measuring the Gly/Ser ratio, a clear reduction in photorespiration was observed in transgenic plants expressing the novel pathway genes compared to wild type plants. A clear decrease in the amount of CO 2 released in the plant mitochondria during photorespiration was also obvious in transgenic lines. The ammonia release bioassay provides an additional evidence for the partial suppression of photorespiration in some of the transgenic lines. Furthermore, establishment of the glycolate pathway in the plant chloroplasts results in a decrease in the CO 2 compensation point (Gamma*). The CO 2 assimilation rates in transgenic plants were also enhanced under photorespiratory conditions. Finally, plant growth measurements revealed that the transgenic plants expressing the glycolate pathway in their chloroplasts have bigger leaf area as well as bigger rosette diameter compared to the control plants. Moreover, the total fresh and dry weight measurements showed that the total plant productivity was enhanced. Interestingly, most of the described effects were also observed in plants that only overexpressed a functional GDH. However, these effects were stronger in plants overexpressing all necessary elements of the glycolate pathway. Moreover, the phenotypical effects were much stronger when the bacterial GDH was compared to the plant GDH. Taken together, it can be concluded that expression of the novel pathway in C 3 plant chloroplast does not only result in a reduction of photorespiration but it also enhances plant growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{emerging}} water contaminants 1, 4 -dioxane and N -nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) are toxic and {{classified as}} probable human carcinogens. Both compounds are persistent {{in the environment}} and are highly mobile in groundwater plumes due to their hydrophilic nature. The major source of 1, 4 -dioxane is due to its use as a stabilizer in the chlorinated solvent 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane. The presence of NDMA as a water contaminant {{is related to the}} release of rocket fuels and its formation in the disinfection of water and wastewater. Prior studies have demonstrated that bacteria expressing monooxygenases are capable of degrading 1, 4 -dioxane and NDMA. While growth on 1, 4 -dioxane as a sole carbon and energy source has been reported in Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB 1190 and Pseudonocardia benzenivorans B 5, it is also co-metabolically degradable by a variety of monooxygenase-expressing strains. In contrast, NDMA has only been observed to biodegrade co-metabolically after growth on some monooxygenase-inducing substrates. The fastest rates of NDMA degradation occur in Rhodococcus sp. RR 1 and Mycobacterium vaccae JOB 5 after growth on propane. Pathways have been proposed for 1, 4 -dioxane biodegradation in P. dioxanivorans and for NDMA biodegradation in propane-induced Rhodococcus sp. RR 1 based only on identified intermediates. The overall goal of this dissertation is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the genes and biological pathways responsible for degradation of 1, 4 -dioxane and NDMA. Due to the lack of molecular sequence information for organisms capable of growth on 1, 4 -dioxane, the genome of P. dioxanivorans strain CB 1190 was sequenced in this study. The genome has a total size of 7, 440, 794 bp and consists of four replicons: a circular chromosome, a circular plasmid pPSED 01, an unclosed circular plasmid pPSED 02, and a linear plasmid pPSED 03. Analysis of this genome sequence revealed the presence of eight multicomponent monooxygenases: a propane monooxygenase, a phenol monooxygenase, a 4 -hydroxyphenylacetate monooxygenase, four aromatic (toluene) monooxygenases, and a tetrahydrofuran (THF) monooxygenase. A total of 92 genes identified as putative dioxygenases were identified. Protein-encoding genes involved in transport systems, signal transduction systems, secretion systems, and heavy-metal and antibiotic resistance were identified. The presence of pathways for carbon and nitrogen metabolism was examined. A complete Calvin-Benson-Bassham carbon fixation pathway was found and a number of carboxylases that function in other carbon fixation pathways were identified. Although P. dioxanivorans has been reported to fix nitrogen, no nitrogenase genes were found. The genome sequence of P. dioxanivorans was compared to other sequenced genomes of members in the family Pseudonocardiaceae, including Amycolatopsis mediterranei S 699, Amycolatopsis mediterranei U 32, Pseudonocardia sp. P 1, Pseudonocardia sp. P 2, Saccharomonaspora azurea NA- 128, Saccharomonospora paurometabolica YIM 9007, Sacharomonospora viridis DSM 43017, Saccharopolyspora erythraea NRRL 2338, and Saccharopolyspora spinosa NRRL 18395. Genome-aided approaches were employed to identify the protein-encoding genes involved in the metabolic degradation of 1, 4 -dioxane in P. dioxanivorans. These approaches included whole genome expression microarray transcriptomics, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), enzyme assays, and heterologous expression clones. Genes differentially expressed during growth on 1, 4 -dioxane, glycolate (a previously identified degradation intermediate), and pyruvate (control) were analyzed to determine genes differentially expressed and involved in the metabolism of 1, 4 -dioxane. Based on the differentially expressed genes, the 1, 4 -dioxane degradation pathway was revised and annotated with the enzymes known to catalyze specific transformation steps. Up-regulation of genes were confirmed and quantified by qRT-PCR. Transcriptional analyses, isotopic tracer analyses with 1, 4 -[U- 13 C]-dioxane, and glyoxylate <b>carboligase</b> enzymatic activity assays confirmed the role of glyoxylate as a central intermediate in the degradation of 1, 4 -dioxane. Specifically, transcriptional analyses indicated that the THF monooxygenase, encoded by thmADBC, is up-regulated during growth on 1, 4 -dioxane and THF. Furthermore, Rhodococcus jostii RHA 1 clones heterologously expressing the P. dioxanivorans genes thmADBC demonstrated 1, 4 -dioxane and THF degradation activity. A surprising result with the THF monooxygenase expressing clones was the accumulation of the intermediate &# 946;-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid (HEAA). This result, combined with the non-inhibitory effect of acetylene on HEAA degradation by 1, 4 -dioxane grown P. dioxanivorans indicates that a monooxygenase is not involved in the transformation of HEAA as previously hypothesized. Transcriptomic microarray analysis of THF- and succinate-grown cells led to the first proposed THF metabolic degradation pathway for P. dioxanivorans. A novel finding of this transcriptomic microarray analysis was the identification of an alcohol dehydrogenase up-regulated during growth on THF that could catalyze the conversion of 2 -hydroxytetrahydrofuran to &# 947;-butyrolactone. The genome sequence of Rhodococcus jostii RHA 1 was utilized to determine the propane-induced monooxygenase responsible for NDMA degradation. The degradation of NDMA was characterized in R. jostii RHA 1 grown on propane and on non-inducing substrates (LB medium, soy broth, and pyruvate). Propane enhanced the removal rate of NDMA by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to constitutive degradation during growth on non-inducing substrate. Transcriptomic microarray and qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that propane elicits the up-regulation of a propane monooxygenase gene cluster. Genetic knockouts of the prmA gene encoding the large hydroxylase component of the propane monooxygenase were unable to grow on propane and degrade NDMA. These results indicate that the propane monooxygenase is responsible for NDMA degradation by R. jostii and explain the enhanced co-metabolic degradation of NDMA in the presence of propane. With the newly gained knowledge of the role of propane monooxygenase in NDMA degradation, oligonucleotide degenerate primers targeting prmA were designed and were identify and quantify the presence of propane monooxygenase genes in Rhodoccocus sp. RR 1 and M. vaccae JOB 5. A homolog to prmA was found in Rhodoccocus sp. RR 1 but not in M. vaccae JOB 5. The prmA gene in Rhodococcus sp. RR 1 was up-regulated during growth on propane relative to pyruvate. Characterization of the kinetics of propane-enhanced NDMA degradation showed that Rhodococcus sp. RR 1 and M. vaccae possess similar maximum transformation rates (44 ± 5 and 28 ± 3 mg NDMA(mg protein) - 1 h - 1, respectively). However, a comparison of half saturation constants (K s,n) and NDMA degradation in the presence of propane revealed pronounced differences between the strains. The K s,n for Rhodococcus sp. RR 1 was 36 ± 10 mg NDMA L - 1 while the propane concentration needed to inhibit NDMA rates by 50 % (K inh) occurred at 7, 700 mg propane L - 1 (R 2 = 0. 9669). In contrast, M. vaccae had a markedly lower affinity for NDMA verses propane with a calculated K s,n of 2, 200 ± 1, 000 mg NDMA L - 1 and K inh of 120 mg propane L - 1 (R 2 = 0. 9895). Differences between the propane monooxygenases in Rhodococcus sp. RR 1 and the unidentified enzyme(s) in M. vaccae may explain the disparities in NDMA degradation and inhibition kinetics between these strains...|$|E
