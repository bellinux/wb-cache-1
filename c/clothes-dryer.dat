50|$|Higher spin speeds, {{along with}} larger tub diameters, remove more water, leading to faster drying. If a heated <b>clothes-dryer</b> is used after the wash and spin, energy use is reduced if more {{water has been}} removed from clothes. However, faster {{spinning}} can crease clothes more. Also, mechanical wear on bearings increases rapidly with rotational speed, reducing life. Early machines would spin at only 300 rpm and, because of lack of any mechanical suspension, would often shake and vibrate.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{energy use}} and {{behaviour}} of older urban Australians {{by identifying the}} key factors that shape their energy demand. As Australia is facing an aging population, understanding what structural and behavioural factors can help improve residential energy efficiency is key for developing effective policy initiatives to support the successful management of household energy costs, wellbeing and carbon emissions within this population. This paper reports on survey and electricity meter data collected for an energy efficiency program involving 1, 647 older householders (aged 60 and above) living within the Brisbane City Council Local Government Area. The program {{was funded by the}} Australian Government Low-Income Energy Efficiency Program (LIEEP) and ran from November 2013 to February 2015. Brisbane is Australia 2 ̆ 7 s third largest city and has a subtropical climate, with warm or hot weather for most of the year. The findings show that electricity consumption within the study 2 ̆ 7 s sample population was influenced by both structural and demographic factors. These factors include range of energy sources used, number of bedrooms and number of people living in the household, as well as type of appliances used in the home. In terms of appliance use, high-energy consuming appliances such as water heating and space cooling systems, <b>clothes-dryers</b> and refrigerators were important predictors of energy consumption. Over two-thirds of the study participants were relying on cooling systems for thermal comfort, and such systems were typically not being used in an energy efficient way. The use of high-energy demand heating and cooling systems can account for around 40...|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} the drying process occurring inside the household electric tumbler <b>clothes-dryer</b> is performed to determine various thermo-physical parameters affecting the energy consumption and {{for the development of}} a simulation model. Experiments are conducted on a test set-up, based on a compact tumble-dryer, to measure the values of the parameters necessary for evaluating the performance. Widely-accepted economy standards are considered for comparison of simulation and experimental results. The simulation results are in reasonable agreement with experimental data. An empirical correlation for the specific moisture-extraction rate (SMER) is developed to translate energy-consumption information from one standard to the other.
