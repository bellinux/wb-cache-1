40|$|Abstract In virtual microscopy, a {{sequential}} {{process of}} captures of microscopical fields, allows {{to construct a}} virtual slide which is visualized using a specialized software, called the virtual microscopy viewer. This tool allows useful exploration of images, composed of thousands of microscopical fields of view {{at different levels of}} magnification, emulating an actual microscopical examination. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the main pathologist's navigation patterns when exploring virtual microscopy slides, using a graphical user interface, adapted to the pathologist's workflow. Four pathologists with a similar level of experience, graduated from the same pathology program, navigated six virtual slides. Different issues were evaluated, namely, the percentage of common visited image regions, the time spent at each and its <b>coincidence</b> <b>level,</b> that is to say, the region of interest location. In addition, navigation patterns were also assessed, i. e., mouse movement velocities and linearity of the diagnostic paths. Results suggest that regions of interest are determined by a complex combination of the visited area, the time spent at each visit and the <b>coincidence</b> <b>level</b> among pathologists. Additionally, linear trajectories and particular velocity patterns were found for the registered diagnostic paths. </p...|$|E

An activation window of the postsynaptic neuron, which is adjustable through spike-timing dependent synaptic adaptation rule, is shown {{to be associated with}} the <b>coincidence</b> <b>level</b> of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) under several restrictions.

40|$|In {{continuous}} vigilance tasks, {{the number}} of coincident panel responses to stimuli provides an index of stimulus detectability. To determine whether this number is due to chance, panel noise levels have been approximated by the maximum <b>coincidence</b> <b>level</b> obtained in stimulus-free conditions. This study proposes an alternative method by which to assess noise levels, derived from queuing system theory (QST). Instead of critical coincidence levels, QST modeling estimates the duration of coinciding responses {{in the absence of}} stimuli. The proposed method has the advantage over previous approaches that it yields more reliable noise estimates and allows for statistical testing. The method was applied in an olfactory detection experiment using 16 panelists in stimulus-present and stimulus-free conditions. We propose that QST may be used as an alternative to signal detection theory for analyzing data from continuous vigilance tasks...|$|E
40|$|Although {{addressed}} in many papers, classifier dependency {{is still not}} well defined. Continuously being described by variety of statistical models from conditional probability to diversity measures, dependency among classifier outputs was recently shown to have a crucial impact {{on the performance of}} multiple classifier system. However, individual classifier performances still represent competitive and simple information clearly related to the performance of the combined system. In this work we show that all the measures related to classifier outputs can be reformulated to represent just different forms of the same information of error coincidences. Applying set analysis for the representation and description of error coincidences we define collection of classifier sets decomposed into two complementary types of <b>coincidence</b> <b>levels.</b> Furthermore we illustrate a high flexibility of using the <b>coincidence</b> <b>levels,</b> which supported be a simple algebra cover many established dependency measures including combining error in case of majority voting. Moreover we show that in the setscollection representation of error coincidences a specific inclusion relation results in a quicker and more effective handling of dependency information under different complexity conditions. In the experimental section we examine relations of the introduced error <b>coincidence</b> <b>levels</b> with majority voting combiner using real datasets and classifiers and indicate further potential applications of the presented concepts...|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} time the 4 pi gamma-ray {{spectrometer}} EUROGAM II has been coupled to a 4 pi light charged particle detector array, DIAMANT, during a test experiment on the reaction S- 32 + Ni- 58 at 120 MeV beam energy. A very large improvement in the peak-to-background ratio of the gamma-spectra has been found when EUROGAM II is triggered by DIAMANT to select an exit channel. A simple algebra has been developed which provides theoretical estimates in good agreement with these experimental results. It is demonstrated that, depending on both the gamma-spectrometer and ancillary detector performances, much better peak-to-background can be obtained by such a coupling. For the same peak-to-background ratio, the use of an ancillary detector allows for a lower gamma-ray <b>coincidence</b> <b>level</b> and therefore improves the statistics.

40|$|One of {{the most}} recent {{challenges}} is the analysis of the forest efficiency in to fix CO 2 using indirect measurements. Some scientific works have been performed exploring remote sensing, which have been based on the relation between radiometric and biophysical data. In spite of being achieved different success results, no mention has been made to the influence of the intrinsic illumination aspects caused by topography. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the influence of the topography in the relationship between radiometric data extracted from TM/Landsat 5 images and log volume data estimated from Eucalyptus spp. stands. The study area is covered by Eucalyptus stands from Votorantin Celulose e Papel, located in Capão Bonito town (SP). Slope and aspect data were utilized in the Illumination Factors determinations that were sliced in different illumination classes. The stands volumes were estimated from 89 sample plots defined in the field, including 11 different Eucalyptus species. Stand volume was correlated with radiometric data extracted from the TM/Landsat 5 images (BRF surface) considering two approaches: neglecting the illumination classes and considering them. Image from TM 4 spectral band presented higher correlation between the mentioned variables. When the illumination classes were taking in account, the correlation coefficients increased from the dark to the better illuminated ones. Linear regression models were established considering both approaches and the stand volume as the dependent variable {{in order to make a}} thematic map with the spatial distribution of the volume. Comparing the two mentioned approaches by an error matrix, the <b>coincidence</b> <b>level</b> between these two set of data resulted in 51 %, indicating that the illumination does influence the relationship between radiometric data and biophysical ones.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was 2 -fold. First, we sought to develop {{statistical}} criteria by which it could be established that the coincident occurrence of pulses of two different hormones exceeds that which would occur by chance alone, thereby suggesting that secretion of the two hormones is either coupled or controlled from a single source generator. Using computer simulations of uncoupled pulse generators operating at different frequencies, {{we were able to}} derive the appropriate statistical criteria and to apply them to achieve our second objective, to determine whether the occasional coincidence of plasma LH and serum PRL pulses that occurs throughout the menstrual cycle in normal women exceeds that which would happen by chance. The results of the computer simulations indicated that pulses emanating from two completely independent oscillators will occur coincidently at a predictable rate, {{despite the fact that the}} generator sources are not coupled; moreover, the rate of coincidence is increased when the pulse frequency of one of the source generators is increased. Using this knowledge and the statistical criteria we derived, we analyzed the coincidence of LH and PRL pulses in five normal women during their early follicular, late follicular, and midluteal phases and in another five women during their late luteal phase. We found that the number of PRL pulses that occurred coincidently with LH pulses consistently exceeded that which would be predicted if the two pulse generators were operating completely independently of one another; however, only during the late follicular and late luteal phases was the <b>coincidence</b> <b>level</b> between LH and PRL pulses sufficiently high in a sufficient number of women to conclude that there was coupling between the pulse sources. These studies suggest, first, that stringent and rigorous statistical criteria must be applied to the analysis of spontaneously coincident secretory phenomena before it can be deduced that two pulse generators are indeed coupled, and second, that the pulse generators governing the secretion of PRL and LH are probably coupled, at least during certain phases of the menstrual cycle. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Legionellosis is an {{uncommon}} form of pneumonia. After a clinical encounter, the necessary antibiotic treatment is available if {{the diagnosis is}} made early in the illness. Before the clinical encounter, early detection of the main pathogen involved, Legionella pneumophila, in hazardous environments is important in preventing infectious levels of this bacterium. In this study a qualitative test based on combined magnetic immunocapture and enzyme-immunoassay for the fast detection of Legionella pneumophila in water samples was compared with the standard method, in both comparative and collaborative trials. The test {{was based on the}} use of anti-Legionella pneumophila antibodies immobilized on magnetic microspheres. The final protocol included concentration by filtration, resuspension and immunomagnetic capture. The whole assay took less than 1 hour to complete. Results A comparative trial was performed against the standard culture method (ISO 11731) on both artificially and naturally contaminated water samples, for two matrices: chlorinated tap water and cooling tower water. Performance characteristics of the test used as screening with culture confirmation resulted in sensitivity, specificity, false positive, false negative, and efficiency of 96. 6 %, 100 %, 0 %, 3. 4 %, and 97. 8 %, respectively. The detection limit at the level under which the false negative rate increases to 50 % (LOD 50) was 93 colony forming units (CFU) in the volume examined for both tested matrices. The collaborative trial included twelve laboratories. Water samples spiked with certified reference materials were tested. In this study the <b>coincidence</b> <b>level</b> between the two methods was 95. 8 %. Conclusion Results demonstrate the applicability of this immunosensing technique to the rapid, simple, and efficient detection of Legionella pneumophila in water samples. This test is not based on microbial growth, so it {{could be used as a}} rapid screening technique for the detection of L. pneumophila in waters, maintaining the performance of conventional culture for isolation of the pathogen and related studies.

40|$|System design {{research}} for upcoming PET-MR scanners has mainly focussed {{on the effect}} of the high magnetic field on PET performance and on the influence of the PET scanner inside the MR bore on MR image quality. However, the presence of MR components close to the PET detectors could also have an influence on PET performance. We have investigated these effects in a simulation study of the preclinical PET-MR insert and of the proposed integrated whole-body system of the HYPERimage project. Simulations were performed with the ProcessGATE extension of the GATE simulation framework, which makes it possible to determine the fractions of total scatter caused by different components. The preclinical insert was simulated inside a clinical MR scanner. All components of the clinical system and the preclinical insert were modeled in realistic dimensions and materials. The PET detector consisted of 10 detector blocks on a 100 mm radius cylinder, each containing a 44 (tangential) by 72 (axial) array of LYSO crystals. The crystal dimensions were 1. 3 * 1. 3 * 10 mm. The energy window was set to 250 - 750 keV. The integrated whole-body system was modeled as the same clinical MR system with a split gradient coil and PET detector blocks between both parts of the split gradient coil. The PET detector blocks in the whole-body system consisted of 22 detector blocks on a 35 cm radius cylinder containing 22 (tangential) by 43 (axial) LYSO crystals. The crystal dimensions were 4 * 4 * 22 mm. The energy window in this configuration was 410 - 700 keV. A uniform cylinder (radius 5 mm, length 100 mm) filled with 1 MBq of 18 F was simulated in both the preclinical insert and the whole-body system. The simulated time was 1 s yielding one million simulated decays. In the preclinical insert only 47 % of detected singles were unscattered. The clinical system and precinical insert accounted for respectively 38 % and 15 % of scattered photons. On the coincidences level the influence of the clinical system was much smaller (17 %), while the scatter effect of the insert increased (20 %). In the clinical system the gradient coils scatter the largest fraction of photons (58 %). In the insert over 65 % of scatter is caused by the table and the RF screen. In the integrated whole-body system 44 % of detected singles were scattered. At <b>coincidence</b> <b>level</b> this fraction was reduced to 34 %. The largest amount of scattered coincidences is caused by the RF screen. In conclusion, it is clear that putting MR components within or close to the FOV of a PET scanner can cause significant scatter. The scattering effect of the MR components should be taken into account in the design phase...|$|E
40|$|To rapidly process biologically {{relevant}} stimuli, sensory {{systems have}} developed a broad variety of coding mechanisms like parallel processing and coincidence detection. Parallel processing (e. g. in the visual system), increases both computational capacity and processing speed by simultaneously coding {{different aspects of the}} same stimulus. Coincidence detection is an efficient way to integrateinformation from different sources. Coincidence has been shown to promote associative learning and memory or stimulus feature detection (e. g. in auditory delay lines). Within the dual olfactory pathway of the honeybee both of these mechanisms might be implemented by uniglomerular projection neurons (PNs) that transfer information from the primary olfactory centers, the antennal lobe (AL), to a multimodal integration center, the mushroom body (MB). PNs from anatomically distinct tracts respond to the same stimulus space, but have different physiological properties, characteristics that are prerequisites for parallel processing of different stimulus aspects. However, the PN pathways also display mirror-imaged like anatomical trajectories that resemble neuronal coincidence detectors as known from auditory delay lines. To investigate temporal processing of olfactory information, we recorded PN odor responses simultaneously from both tracts and measured coincident activity of PNs within and between tracts. Our results show that <b>coincidence</b> <b>levels</b> are different within each of the two tracts. Coincidence also occurs between tracts, but to a minor extent compared to coincidence within tracts.

The technique {{is able to}} detect low amplitude oscillations in the solar irradiance by making simultaneous measurements at continuum wavelengths of 0. 507 μm, 0. 747 μm, and 1. 600 μm. Data is collected from a rectangular region covering approximately 57 % of the solar disk, extending ± 0. 30 R(⊙) about the solar rotational axis, and ± 0. 38 R(⊙) about the solar equator, using square pixels varying in linear size from 0. 032 R(⊙) to 0. 053 R(⊙). A differential spatial filter is applied, taking advantage of cancellations of undesired variations and forming a signal which is sensitive to most modes with spherical harmonic index l ≤ 7. Linear combinations are made of the three solar signals and the telescope internal Temperature signal, mitigating the deleterious effects of the terrestrial atmosphere and of local temperature variations. Frequencies of local maxima in the Power Spectrum of the residual signal, in the 400 μHz to 850 μHz range, {{are found to be}} consistent with those determined by solar limb profile measurements made in 1979.

In-house software was developed to produce and analyze sinograms from the simulated data. With our model of the GE Advance/Discovery LS PET scanner, the ratio of the sensitivities with sources radially offset 0 and 10 cm from the scanner's main axis are reproduced to within 1 of measurements. Similarly, the simulated scatter fraction for the NEMA NU 2 - 2001 phantom agrees to within less than 3 of measured values (the measured scatter fractions are 44. 8 and 40. 9 Â± 1. 4 and the simulated scatter fraction is 43. 5 Â± 0. 3). The simulated count rate curves were made to match the experimental curves by using deadtimes as fit parameters. This resulted in deadtime values of 625 and 332 ns at the Block and <b>Coincidence</b> <b>levels,</b> respectively. The experimental peak true count rate of 139. 0 kcps and the peak activity concentration of 21. 5 kBq/cc were matched by the simulated results to within 0. 5 and 0. 1 respectively. The simulated count rate curves also resulted in a peak NECR of 35. 2 kcps at 10. 8 kBq/cc compared to 37. 6 kcps at 10. 0 kBq/cc from averaged experimental values. The spatial resolution of the simulated scanner matched the experimental results to within 0. 2 mm. Â© 2006 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|R
40|$|A {{system to}} {{selectively}} detect and quantify the xenon metastable isotopes 131 mXe, 133 mXe, 133 Xe, and 135 Xe has been designed, fabricated, and tested. The system combines high-resolution electron and gamma-ray spectrometry with coincidence/anti-coincidence timing for signal selectivity and background rejection. By utilizing X-ray-fluorescence gating, backgrounds {{from other sources}} {{are expected to be}} reduced to the sub-becquerel <b>level.</b> <b>Coincidence</b> and anti-coincidence triggers are formed from the several individual detectors that comprise the system and used to identify K-shell conversion electrons and fluorescence X-rays from a 109 Cd test source with good efficiencies and energy resolutions (20  keV for the low-energy electrons, ~ 1. 2  keV for the fluorescence X-rays, respectively).

40|$|We note an {{intriguing}} <b>coincidence</b> in nuclear <b>levels,</b> that the subshells responsible for doubly magic numbers happen to bracket nuclei at the energies of the Standard Model bosons. This could show that these bosons actually {{contribute to the}} effective mesons of nuclear models. Dear Grubendol, I want to report you and the fellows of your society about some strange coincidences I have found in nuclei tables. They {{are related to the}} availability of virtual J= 0 particles from the Standard Model. Let me to organise the letter in small sections, so I will first comment on global issues, then to look into the coincidences in detail, and finally to do some remarks about their possible significance. ...|$|R
40|$|We report {{electrical}} transport measurements in a tilted {{magnetic field}} on a high-mobility two-dimensional electron system confined at the MgZnO/ZnO heterointerface. The observation of multiple crossing events of spin-resolved Landau levels (LLs) enables the mapping {{of the sequence}} of electronic states. We further measure the renormalization of electron spin susceptibility at zero field and the susceptibility dependence on the electron spin polarization. The latter manifests the deviation from the Pauli spin susceptibility. As the result, the crossing of spin-resolved LLs shifts to smaller tilt angles and the first Landau <b>level</b> <b>coincidence</b> event is absent even when the magnetic field has only a perpendicular component to the 2 DES plane.

40|$|The level {{scheme of}} 79 Kr {{has been studied}} through the 79 Br(p,n) 79 Kr {{reaction}} at proton energies from 1 · 7 to 5 · 0 MeV. γ-ray and internal conversion electron measurements were made using Ge(Li) detectors and a six gap “Orange” electron spectrometer. The level scheme was established by determining the thresholds of variousγ-rays and byγ-γ and n-γ <b>coincidence</b> measurements. New <b>levels</b> at 402, 450, 660, 676, 695, 720, 810, 836, 907 and 1038 keV not observed in earlier radioactivity studies have been established.
