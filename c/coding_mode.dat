Interlace specific coding tools, such as MBAFF and PAFF, are not supported in HEVC. HEVC instead sends metadata that tells how the interlaced video was sent.

For interlaced video HEVC can change between frame coding and field coding using Sequence Adaptive Frame Field (SAFF), which allows the <b>coding</b> <b>mode</b> to be changed for each video sequence.

40|$|Abstract—Data {{partitioning}} (DP) is {{an efficient}} error-resilient video coding tool. Its contribution to performance {{improvement in the}} error-prone environment arises from the superior error concealment mechanisms that are available {{with the help of}} protected data partitions. Since error-concealment in terms of DP is closely related to <b>coding</b> <b>mode,</b> it is desirable to have an optimized <b>coding</b> <b>mode</b> selection scheme. However, the existing <b>coding</b> <b>mode</b> selection techniques usually assume that the same error-concealment mechanism is used for a block when it is lost, and the associated distortion also remains the same. Obviously, this assumption is not true when DP involves. In this paper, a generalized end-to-end distortion model is proposed for the rate-distortion optimized <b>coding</b> <b>mode</b> selection, which fully utilizes the superior error-concealment mechanism in terms of DP. The proposed distortion model is also advantageous in the suppression of approximation errors caused by pixel average operations such as sub-pixel interpolation and deblocking filter. Therefore, it can lead to a low-complexity solution for real-time applications such as live streaming.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve a high {{compression}} ratio, the Context-Based Adaptive Variable Length Coding (CBAVLC) standard has incorporated {{a large number of}} <b>coding</b> <b>modes</b> which must be evaluated during the coding process to determine the optimal rate-distortion trade-off. The coding gains of CBAVLC arise at the expense of significant coder complexity. One coder process that has been identified as having potential for achieving computation savings is the selection between skipping the coding of a macro block and coding of the macro block in one of the remaining <b>coding</b> <b>modes.</b> In low contrast images, a large percentage of macro blocks are “skipped”, that is, no coded data are transmitted for these macro blocks. By estimating and identifying macro blocks to be skipped during the coding process, significant savings in computation can be realized, since the coder then does not evaluate the rate-distortion costs of all candidate <b>coding</b> <b>modes.</b> The proposed scheme shows that this approach can result in a time savings of over 80 % for lowcontrast images at a negligible decrease or, in certain cases, a slight increase in quality over a reference codec...|$|R
