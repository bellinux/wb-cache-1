5|$|According to a {{biography}} of Rosenberg on the Center for Nonviolent Communication (CNVC) website, Nonviolent Communication training evolved from his search {{for a way to}} rapidly disseminate peacemaking skills. CNVC says that NVC emerged from work he was doing with civil rights activists in the early 1960s, and that during this period he also mediated between rioting students and <b>college</b> <b>administrators,</b> and worked to peacefully desegregate public schools in long-segregated regions.|$|E
5|$|Holmes was keenly {{involved}} with {{the details of the}} Agricultural College, influencing everything from the purchase of land for the campus, layout of the buildings, and even the placement of the chairs and tables. Once the College opened, he assumed the role of treasurer and later Professor of Horticulture. By 1861, Holmes had fallen out of favor with the other <b>College</b> <b>administrators,</b> and retired to his home in Detroit. Nevertheless, he continued to support and visit the college until his death in 1887.|$|E
5|$|In March 1807, about 125 {{students}} {{organized a}} protest against the college's strict conduct policies and rigorous study requirements. The protest included signing a formal petition of protest; <b>college</b> <b>administrators</b> subsequently suspended everyone who refused to withdraw his name from the petition. Breckinridge was required to apologize {{for his part in}} the protest in order to return to school, but he refused to do so. In May, he left Princeton for Cabell's Dale, but in Philadelphia he found that there were no available stages heading west for two weeks. Unable to afford room and board for that long, he went to Fincastle, Virginia, to stay with relatives. He considered enrolling at the College of William and Mary for the fall term in 1807, believing he could complete his studies in nine months but ultimately decided against it. Harrison surmises that the lack of correspondence between Breckinridge and his family in Kentucky between July 1807 to July 1808 indicated that he was at Cabell's Dale during most or all of that period.|$|E

25|$|Although most Nisei college {{students}} followed their families into camp, {{a small number}} tried to arrange for transfers to schools outside the exclusion zone {{in order to continue}} their education. Their initial efforts expanded as sympathetic <b>college</b> <b>administrators</b> and the American Friends Service Committee began to coordinate a larger student relocation program. The Friends petitioned WRA Director Milton Eisenhower to place {{college students}} in Eastern and Midwestern academic institutions. The National Japanese American Student Relocation Council was formed on May 29, 1942, and the AFSC administered the program.|$|E
25|$|Welden didn't {{return to}} campus. Her roommate thought {{she must have}} gone to the library to study for exams, but the next morning, Welden still hadn't returned. Once the <b>college</b> <b>administrators</b> were notified, they {{immediately}} started a search of the campus itself. The Bennington County State's Attorney was notified, and the county sheriff was brought in to help with the search. Over the next couple of days, her visit to the Long Trail was discovered when one of the hikers she had approached identified her from the photo in the Bennington Banner newspaper, where he worked.|$|E
25|$|St. Olafâ€™s Student Government Association (SGA) {{finances}} many student {{activities and}} organizations on campus.

25|$|The {{motto of}} the Fraternity is, Achievement in every field of human endeavor. During {{this time there}} were very few African-American {{students}} at the majority white campus at Bloomington, Indiana and they were a small minority due to the era of the Jim Crow laws. Many African-American students rarely saw each other on campus and were discouraged or prohibited from attending student functions and extracurricular activities by white <b>college</b> <b>administrators</b> and fellow students. African-American students were denied membership on athletic teams with the exception of track and field. The racial prejudice and discrimination encountered by the founders strengthened their bond of friendship and growing interest in starting a social group.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, <b>college</b> <b>administrators</b> urged its undergraduate members to stay in school. However, many were eager to enlist. The first Phis {{to fight in the}} war were members of the chapters at the University of Toronto and McGill University, the fraternity's only Canadian chapters during that period. By the time the United States entered the war in 1917, over 5000 Phis served in the conflict with 155 of them losing their lives. Because many of the undergraduate Phis put their studies on hold, many chapter houses either had limited occupants or none at all. To prevent losing houses pending the return of Phis from the war, many housing corporations consented to having the houses used as barracks or for YMCA programs.|$|E
25|$|An {{internal}} {{investigation by the}} university released in 2011 and another investigation commissioned by former North Carolina governor Jim Martin in 2012 found numerous academic and ethical issues with the AFAM department, including unauthorized grade changes and faculty signatures, classes with very little teaching taking place, and a disproportionate proportion of the student-athletes enrolled in affected classes. Then in 2014 began charges and counter-charges between university officials and former learning specialist Mary Willingham, including disputes about statistics and methods of analysis by Willingham alleging that certain student-athletes are not academically qualified for college. Additionally, former basketball player Rashad McCants, {{a member of the}} North Carolina basketball team that won the 2005 NCAA championship, said that he took substandard classes and had much of his classwork done by tutors. As a result of these revelations, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools placed the university on probation for one year, which ended in June 2016. The NCAA completed its investigation in October of 2017, finding no violations of the NCAA's rules and imposing no athletic punishments. It affected a variety of different people in different ways, including coaches, players, judges, politicians, academics, rivals, whistleblowers, lawyers, alumni, mascots, <b>college</b> <b>administrators,</b> the NCAA, state governors, and journalists. The controversy sparked debate as to whether the university was educating some of its student-athletes properly and the role of NCAA Division I athletics in colleges.|$|E

[...] She also questioned the [...] "peer assessment" [...] portion of the rankings and suggested that college presidents are rarely aware of educational improvements in their peer institutions; she noted that Washington & Jefferson College's ranking has remained the same {{for a number of}} years, even while the college made significant improvements acceptance rates and overall selectivity, the addition of academic programs, and the construction of additional buildings. [...] Haring-Smith's criticism of the rankings spurred Bob Morse, the founder of the U.S. College Rankings system to respond to the criticisms directly in an article.

500|$|The {{fortunes}} of the fraternity system at Dartmouth followed a boom and bust pattern {{in the early twentieth}} century. Several organizations purchased frame houses or built their own between 1898 and 1907, including Beta Theta Pi, Kappa Kappa Kappa, Phi Delta Alpha, and Psi Upsilon. [...] The economic expansion of the 1920s created a boom in the {{fortunes of}} the fraternities, allowing many to build new brick residences near campus, including Zeta Psi, Kappa Kappa Kappa, Phi Sigma Kappa, Sigma Nu, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Chi Phi, Theta Delta Chi, Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma Chi, Gamma Delta Chi, and Delta Tau Delta. It was during this period that Webster Avenue developed as [...] "fraternity row". [...] The new residences were built without significant dining facilities, as the Trustees of the college had banned fraternities from serving regular meals in their chapter houses and had limited the number of resident brothers by the fall semester of 1909. [...] <b>College</b> <b>administrators</b> also challenged the fraternities to become more engaged in College life and less focused on their fraternity life during this time. [...] College President Ernest Martin Hopkins personally decided to abolish freshman rush in 1924.|$|E
