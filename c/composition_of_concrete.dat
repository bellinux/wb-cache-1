As debonding failure occurs within {{the concrete}}, interfacial friction resulted from aggregate interlocking between opposing surfaces of the debonded zone {{plays an important role in}} the debonding behavior. Interfacial debonding can be analyzed with a three-parameter model. To investigate the effect <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>composition</b> on debonding behavior, the direct shear test was conducted with ten different <b>compositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> Interfacial parameters were then derived according to a three-parameter model. The test results show little correlation between interfacial parameters and concrete compressive or splitting tensile strength. However, the debonding initiation strength and residual shear strength correlates well with the surface tensile strength and the maximum crack opening is mainly governed by the aggregate content.

40|$|Objectives. The optimal granulometric <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> filler {{compound}} ensures the production <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> having improved  physical and mechanical characteristics, {{as well as}} minimal binder  consumption. The properties <b>of</b> heat-resistant <b>concrete</b> largely  depend on the type and the ratio of its components. Taking this into  account, {{the aim of the}} study is to determine the optimal grain composition <b>of</b> heat-resistant <b>concrete.</b> Methods. Methods for optimising the properties <b>of</b> heatresistant basaltic <b>concrete</b> with a composite binder and  mechanochemical activation of the filler grains were used during the  course of the research. A simplex-centroid experiment design is  applied for this purpose. The composite binder was subjected to  mechanochemical activation. Samples were made by vibration-pressing from a concrete mix with a cone draught of 2 cm. Results. The grain composition <b>of</b> heat-resistant <b>concrete</b> is proved  {{to be the most important}} variable factor, regulating which the  properties <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> can be varied. The <b>compositions</b> <b>of</b> heat- resistant basaltic concrete with activated composite binder having a  maximum application temperature of 700 ºС are developed.  The  influence <b>of</b> the grain <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> the basaltic filler on the  properties <b>of</b> basaltic <b>concrete</b> using mathematical experiment planning methods is determined.

The granulometric <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> heat-resistant basaltic <b>concrete</b> based on the activated binder is optimised for basic physical and technical properties. The optimal granulometric  design of the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> heat-resistant <b>concrete</b> indicates that as the coarse fraction (particles greater than  0. 63 mm) in the filler  composition increases, the ultimate tensile strength and bending  stress <b>of</b> heatresistant basaltic <b>concrete</b> is increased when heated to  a temperature of 700 ºС.
