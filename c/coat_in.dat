5|$|More recently, the {{discovery}} of Zhenyuanlong established {{the presence of a}} full feathered <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> relatively large dromaeosaurs. Additionally, the animal displays proportionally large, aerodynamic wing feathers, as well as a tail-spanning fan, both of which are unexpected traits that may offer an understanding of the integument of large dromaeosaurs. Dakotaraptor is an even larger dromaeosaur species with evidence of feathers, albeit indirect in the form of quill knobs.|$|E
5|$|More than 10% of the hamsters kept in {{the first}} winter develop the summer <b>coat.</b> <b>In</b> the second winter, only a few change into the winter coat and winter colour is less pronounced. The {{moulting}} in the winter fur starts in October or November and is completed in December, while the summer coat begins in January or February and is completed in March or early April. The ears are grey with a pinkish tint.|$|E

5|$|Pigments are {{coloured}} chemicals (such as melanin) {{in animal}} tissues. For example, the Arctic fox has a white <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> winter (containing little pigment), and a brown <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> summer (containing more pigment), {{an example of}} seasonal camouflage (a polyphenism). Many animals, including mammals, birds, and amphibians, are unable to synthesize most of the pigments that colour their fur or feathers, other than the brown or black melanins that give many mammals their earth tones. For example, the bright yellow of an American goldfinch, the startling orange of a juvenile red-spotted newt, the deep red of a cardinal and the pink of a flamingo are all produced by carotenoid pigments synthesized by plants. In {{the case of the}} flamingo, the bird eats pink shrimps, which are themselves unable to synthesize carotenoids. The shrimps derive their body colour from microscopic red algae, which like most plants are able to create their own pigments, including both carotenoids and (green) chlorophyll. Animals that eat green plants do not become green, however, as chlorophyll does not survive digestion.|$|E
5|$|Cremello or Blue-eyed cream horses have rosy pink skin, {{pale blue}} eyes and cream-colored coats, {{indicating}} that pigment cells and pigment {{are present in the}} skin, eyes, and coat, but at lower levels. Dominant white horses do not have pigment cells, and thus no pigment, in the skin or <b>coat.</b> <b>In</b> addition, dominant white horses seldom have blue eyes. Other genetic factors, or combinations of genetic factors, such as the pearl gene or champagne gene, can also produce cremello-like coats. These coat colors may be distinguishable from dominant white by their unusually colored eyes.|$|E
5|$|Scherzinger {{performed}} the {{song for the}} first time in Stratford, London at Westfield Stratford City on September 13, 2011. The performance was included in a set of multiple songs off of Killer Love, and was sung in order to celebrate the shopping centre's opening. Scherzinger began her performance with a fringed leather <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> red and black, the colours of the Westfield logo, a cutaway black bodycon dress and purple platform heels which she whipped off to reveal an even racier outfit underneath. She than wore a black leather number covered in tassels and chains. Scherzinger's performance was accompanied onstage by several dancers, whom were wearing shiny metallic trousers, as she performed in front of thousands of fans. The song was also performed in 2012 on her first solo tour, the Killer Love Tour.|$|E

5|$|The jackal's fur is coarse and {{relatively}} short, with the base color golden, varying seasonally from a pale creamy yellow {{to a dark}} tawny. The fur on the back is composed of a mixture of black, brown, and white hairs, sometimes giving {{the appearance of the}} dark saddle like that seen on the black-backed jackal. The underparts are a light pale ginger to cream color. Individual specimens can be distinguished by their unique light markings on the throat and chest. The coats of jackals from high elevations tend to be more buff-colored than those of their lowland counterparts while those of jackals in rocky, mountainous areas may exhibit a grayer shade. The bushy tail has a tan to black tip. Melanism can cause a dark-colored <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> some golden jackals, a coloring once fairly common in Bengal. Unlike melanistic wolves and coyotes that received their dark pigmentation from interbreeding with domestic dogs, melanism in golden jackals probably stems from an independent mutation that could be an adaptive trait. What is possibly an albino specimen was photographed in southeastern Iran during 2012.|$|E
5|$|During the fall, elk grow a thicker coat of hair, {{which helps}} to {{insulate}} {{them during the}} winter. Males, females and calves of Siberian and North American elk all grow thin neck manes; female and young Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis do not. By early summer, the heavy winter coat has been shed, and elk are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies. All elk have small and clearly defined rump patches with short tails. They have different coloration based on the seasons and types of habitats, with gray or lighter coloration prevalent {{in the winter and}} a more reddish, darker <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> the summer. Subspecies living in arid climates tend to have lighter colored coats than do those living in forests. Most have lighter yellow-brown to orange-brown coats in contrast to dark brown hair on the head, neck, and legs during the summer. Forest-adapted Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis have darker reddish-brown coats with less contrast between the body coat {{and the rest of the}} body during the summer months. Calves are born spotted, as is common with many deer species, and they lose their spots by the end of summer. Adult Manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older. This characteristic has also been observed in the forest-adapted European red deer.|$|E

25|$|This {{suggests}} that the earlier frock from the 18th century is more the direct ancestor of the modern dress coat, whereas the frock <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century, the subject under discussion here, is a different garment altogether with separate military origins in the 19th century, although a remote historical connection to the frock cannot entirely be excluded.|$|E

25|$|These {{relations}} {{can be seen}} {{in similar}} foreign terms. The modern word for a dress <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> Italian, French, Romanian and Spanish is frac; in German Frack; and Portuguese fraque, used in the late 18th century to describe a garment very similar to the frock, being a single or double-breasted garment with a diagonally cutaway front {{in the manner of a}} modern morning coat. Even coats with horizontally cut away skirts like a dress coat were referred to as a frock in the late eighteenth and very early 19th century, before being renamed to dress coat.|$|E

25|$|Frock coats {{worn with}} {{waistcoat}} and formal striped trousers {{are still very}} occasionally worn as daytime formal wear, especially to weddings, {{as an alternative to}} morning coats, in order to give the wedding attire a Victorian flavour. They are today usually only worn by the wedding party, where elements of historical costume are more acceptable, and even this practice is unusual, as its role as a formal ceremonial <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> daytime formal wear has been long supplanted in modern dress code by the morning coat. Like morning coats, frock coats are only worn for daytime formal events before 5p.m. and no later than until around 7p.m.|$|E
25|$|A search {{concluded}} that there was no T. Keane missing in any English-speaking country and a nationwide circulation of the dry-cleaning marks also proved fruitless. In fact, all that could be garnered from the suitcase was that since a <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> the suitcase had a front gusset and featherstitching, it could have been made only in the United States, as this was the only country that possessed the machinery for that stitch. Although mass-produced, the body work is done when the owner is fitted before it is completed. The coat had not been imported, indicating the man had been in the United States or bought the coat from someone of similar size who had been.|$|E
25|$|The seed coat {{develops}} {{from the}} maternal tissue, the integuments, originally surrounding the ovule. The seed <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> the mature seed {{can be a}} paper-thin layer (e.g. peanut) or something more substantial (e.g. thick and hard in honey locust and coconut), or fleshy as in the sarcotesta of pomegranate. The seed coat helps protect the embryo from mechanical injury, predators and drying out. Depending on its development, the seed coat is either bitegmic or unitegmic. Bitegmic seeds form a testa from the outer integument and a tegmen from the inner integument while unitegmic seeds have only one integument. Usually parts of the testa or tegmen form a hard protective mechanical layer. The mechanical layer may prevent water penetration and germination. Amongst the barriers may be the presence of lignified sclereids.|$|E

25|$|Trench coats have {{remained}} fashionable {{in the decades}} following World War II. Their original role {{as part of an}} army officer's uniform lent the trench coat a businesslike respectability, although many prefer to tie the belt in front (rather than use the buckle) to project a more casual look than strict military dress. Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine from Casablanca and Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau wore the trench <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> the public eye. Often, a fedora or an ushanka (during colder weather) was also worn. In the 1960s, radical intellectuals wore trench coats over black turtleneck sweaters, while some Mods wore trench coats as fashionable overcoats, {{as an alternative to the}} fishtail parka or crombie. Streakers and flashers often prefer trench coats since they conceal the wearer's lack of undergarments and can be opened quickly when the exhibitionist is ready to expose him or herself.|$|E

25|$|Microfilarial {{detection}} {{was accomplished}} most commonly {{in the past}} by the microscopic identification of microfilariae on a direct blood smear, above the buffy <b>coat</b> <b>in</b> a microhematocrit tube (or capillary tube), using the , or after millipore filtration. The accuracy of these tests, typically used for routine screening or diagnosis of heartworm infection, is improved by multiple testing. The modified Knott test and millipore filtration are more sensitive because they concentrate microfilariae, improving the chance of diagnosis. The direct smear technique allows examination of larval motion, helping in the distinction of D. immitis from Acanthocheilonema reconditum. This distinction is important because {{the presence of the}} latter parasite does not require expensive and potentially harmful therapy. However, the potential for a microfilaremic infections is 5-67%. The number of circulating microfilariae does not correlate with the number of adult heartworms, so is not an indicator of disease severity.|$|E
