50|$|The Falcon Concentrator {{is a type}} {{of gravity}} {{separation}} device for the recovery of valuable metals and minerals. There are three types of Falcon Concentrators: Falcon Semi-Batch (SB), Falcon <b>Continuous</b> (<b>C)</b> and Falcon Ultra-Fine (UF). All models of Falcon Concentrator rely on the creation of centrifugal forces by way of a rapidly rotating, vertical bowl in order to stratify and separate particles based on weight. The amount of gravitational force generated and the method of collecting these heavier particles differs for each model.|$|E
50|$|The Falcon <b>Continuous</b> (<b>C)</b> {{centrifugal}} concentrator {{is primarily}} {{used for the}} separation of heavy minerals which occur in ore concentrations above 0.1% by weight, such as cassiterite, tantalum and scheelite. It is also used for coal cleaning and pre-concentration of gold bearing ores. The machine generates forces up to 300 times {{the force of gravity}} (300 G's) and operates by using a smooth-walled, rotating bowl to stratify the material into heavier and lighter fractions then uses pneumatic valves to control the amount of heavy material that reports to the concentrate collection stream. It does not use any fluidization water and relies entirely on centrifugal force for separation. The Falcon C concentrator is used in various process plants around the world, such as the Tanco mine in Canada, the Sekisovskoye mine in Kazakhstan and the Renison tin mine in Tasmania.|$|E

40|$|Chlamydia pneumoniae is a {{well-established}} cause of community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis in adults and children. Chronic infections with C. pneumoniae have {{been implicated in}} the development of atherosclerosis and other diseases in humans. Methods currently used for the culture and propagation of C. pneumoniae are not analogous to the infection as it occurs in vivo. We have established a model of <b>continuous</b> <b>C.</b> pneumoniae infection in vitro. HEp- 2 cells inoculated with CM- 1 and TW- 183 strains have been persistently infected for periods of over 1. 5 and 2 years, respectively. The cultures were maintained without centrifugation or the addition of cycloheximide, fresh host cells, or chlamydia. We observed cycles of host cell lysis, detachment, and regrowth with both strains of C. pneumoniae. <b>Continuous</b> <b>C.</b> pneumoniae infections may more closely resemble the actual events as they occur in vivo and, therefore, may be a better model for the in vitro study of C. pneumoniae infection.

This work includes the design and estimates of <b>continuous</b> R. <b>C.</b> <b>C.</b> beams and <b>continuous</b> pre-stressed concrete beams of various spans. In today’s jet age, we have a host of construction techniques at our disposal. Steel structures, R. C. C. Structures, Core and hull type of structure (combination of steel & R. C.

The best way is to select the type of construction, depending on the circumstances and type of structure. The aim {{of this paper is}} to design medium span <b>continuous</b> R. <b>C.</b> C. beams as well as continuous pre-stressed concrete variety and then compare the results. Programming in MS EXCEL is done to design the beams. The idea is to reach a definite conclusion regarding the superiority of the two techniques over one another.

Y. pestis and the closely related Y. pseudotuberculosis also block the feeding of Caenorhabditis elegans by forming a biofilm on the nematode head. C. elegans mutants with severe motility defects acquire almost no biofilm, indicating that normal animals accumulate the biofilm matrix as they move through a Yersinia lawn. Using the lectin wheat germ agglutinin as a probe, we show that the matrix on C. elegans contains carbohydrate produced by Yersinia. The carbohydrate is present in bacterial lawns prior to addition of nematodes, indicating that biofilm formation does not involve signaling between the two organisms. Furthermore, biofilm accumulation depends on <b>continuous</b> <b>C.</b> elegans exposure to a lawn of Yersinia bacteria...|$|E

40|$|Reactive {{blending}} of phthalic anhydride end-capped polystyrene-b-polyisoprene diblock (PS-b-PIP-anh) with 80 wt % of polyamide 12 (PA 12) {{results in the}} very rapid formation of a PS-b-PIP-b-PA triblock copolymer, which self-assembles with formation of characteristic nanoobjects, within the polyamide matrix. For instance, a vesicular nanostructure is formed in the particular case of a symmetric, lamellar-forming diblock copolymer. This morphology actually complies with the lower curvature possible for ABC lamellae diluted in a <b>continuous</b> <b>C</b> phase under shear. In contrast, when the diblock composition is typically asymmetric (at constant molecular weight), vesicles disappear {{in favor of a}} core-shell morphology with a cucumber-like suborganization. This spontaneous nanostructuration of the PA 12 matrix is quite general. Indeed substitution of an amorphous primary amine end-capped styrene/acrylonitrile random copolymer (SAN-NH 2) for PA 12 results in exactly the same phase morphology upon reactive blending with PS-b-PIP-anh.
