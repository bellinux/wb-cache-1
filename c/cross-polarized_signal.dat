40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the cancellation network approach for reducing crosstalk caused by depolarization on a dual-polarized communications satellite link. If {{the characteristics of}} rain depolarization are sufficiently well known, the cancellation network can be designed {{in a way that}} reduces system complexity, the most important parameter being the phase of the <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>signal.</b> Relevant theoretical calculations and experimental data are presented. The simplicity of the cancellation system proposed makes it ideal for use with small domestic or private earth terminals...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{theoretically}} study {{parametric amplification}} in highly birefringent optical fibers {{and show that}} large tunable optical delay or advancement can be achieved via slow and fast light propagation. We provide a clear derivation of the formula for the optical delay that originates from the imaginary part of the parametric gain. We also perform numerical simulations in both normal and anomalous dispersion regimes. In the latter case, results show that large nanosecond optical delay could, in principle, be obtained at 1550 nm in a 1 -km-long polarization-maintaining fiber. We further demonstrate that the optical delay and advancement rely on a group-velocity locking between the two <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>signal</b> and idler pulses...|$|E
40|$|The {{considered}} investigation {{made use}} of the Communications Technology Satellite (CTS) downlink and the beacons carried by the Comstar satellites. The general behavior of rain attenuation and depolarization is illustrated {{with the aid of}} data from a storm which took place on July 15, 1976. The effect of the rain on the copolarized signal is indicated in a graph. Another graph shows the behavior of the <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>signal</b> component. Phase effects are also considered together with statistical curves for attenuation. The considered data from CTS indicate that, at least during summer convective storms, attenuation at 11. 7 GHz is much more severe than anticipated. Attenuation may be a more serious impediment to dual polarized satellite links at this frequency than is depolarization...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-resolution}} channel sounding {{technique has}} been used to investigate the cross-polarization of electromagnetic waves in the 5 - 6 GHz band. Experiments were performed in two non-line-of-sight indoor locations, and it was found that there is a strong dependency of the cross-polarization of multipath components on the elevation angle-of-arrival. For a vertically polarized transmitting antenna, clusters of co-polarized multipath components were confined predominantly to the region around the horizontal plane that contains the virtual line-of-sight between transmitter and receiver. In contrast, <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>signals</b> were detected for a variety of elevation angles with considerable power levels. The surroundings of the receiver were identified as the principal source of depolarized signals. In addition, time dispersion analysis of the multipath signals led to the determination of the AoAs where there is a strong correspondence between co- and <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>signals</b> {{as a consequence of the}} partial depolarization of MPCs. This work supports the exploitation of the joint space and polarization diversities in indoor propagation scenarios to improve the system performance...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{designed to}} use the Space Shuttle in tests of the mechanical and electrical properties of spaceborne deployable antennas under zero-gravity conditions is outlined. Space-erectable 20 -meter diameter phased arrays or reflector/feed systems, and self-deploying mechanisms, are to be tested. Reflector surface integrity will be tested by an AM laser technique, and electrical behavior will be tested by a spin-stabilized RF beacon injected into orbit prior to unfurlment of the antenna. Focusing and gain measurements, static pattern measurements, dynamic RF gain measurements, and measurements of <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>signals</b> will be conducted, and the reflector will be illuminated by separate feeds for the S-, X-, and K-bands. Mechanical features of the mesh-wrapped rib furlable antenna design are described...|$|R
40|$|Hurricane-force wind speeds {{can have}} a large {{societal}} impact and in this paper microwave C-band <b>cross-polarized</b> (VH) <b>signals</b> are investigated to assess {{if they can be}} used to derive extreme wind speed conditions. European satellite scatterometers have excellent hurricane penetration capability at C-band, but the vertically (VV) polarized signals become insensitive above 25 m s − 1. VV and VH polarized backscatter signals from RADARSAT- 2 SAR imagery acquired during severe hurricane events were compared to collocated SFMR wind measurements acquired by NOAA's hurricane-hunter aircraft. From this data set a Geophysical Model Function (GMF) at strong-to-extreme/severe wind speeds (i. e. 20 m s − 1 U 10 − 1) is derived. Within this wind speed regime, cross-polarized data showed no distinguishable loss of sensitivity and as such, cross-polarized data can be considered a good candidate for the retrieval of strong-to-severe wind speeds from satellite instruments. The upper limit of 45 m s − 1 is defined by the currently available collocated data. The validity of the derived relationship between wind speed and VH has been evaluated by comparing the cross polarized signals to two independent wind speed datasets, i. e. short-range ECMWF Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model forecast winds and the NOAA best estimate one-minute maximum sustained winds. Analysis of the three comparison data sets confirm that <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>signals</b> from satellites will enable the retrieval of strong-to-severe wind speeds where VV or horizontal (HH) polarization data has saturated. The VH backscatter increases exponentially with respect to wind speed (linear against VH [dB]) and a near real time assessment of maximum sustained wind speed is possible using VH measurements. VH measurements thus would be an extremely valuable complement on next-generation scatterometers for Hurricane forecast warnings and hurricane model initialization...|$|R
40|$|Radar {{polarization}} {{measurements of}} precipitation at 16. 5 GHz are analyzed {{with reference to}} the ambient temperature profile of the atmosphere. The measured quantities are the reflectivity, the ratio of the main and <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>signal</b> powers, called the cancellation, and the correlation between these two signals. Polarization observations of the bright band are discussed. It is suggested that correlation gives an indication of the relative number of water drops in the scattering ensemble. From the characteristics of correlation and cancellation observations it is inferred that small snowflakes melt first with the result that radar returns are dominated by large water-covered snow aggregates at levels just below the reflectivity peak in the bright band. Correlation measurements are used to infer possible precipitation types at various altitudes in convective precipitation. A region of mixed-phase scatterers 18 postulated above the 0 °C level, with ice phase scatterers above and rain or rain-like particles below...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Detection of {{subsurface}} {{returns from}} the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) on the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite were demonstrated. Despite the coarse range resolution of this aerosol lidar, evidence of subsurface scattering was observed as a delay and broadening of the <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>signal</b> relative to the co-polarized signal in the three near-surface range bins. These two effects contributed to an increased depolarization at the nominal depth of 25 m. These features were all correlated with near-surface chlorophyll concentrations. An increase in the depolarization was also seen {{at a depth of}} 50 m under certain conditions, suggesting that chlorophyll concentration at that depth could be estimated if an appropriate retrieval technique can be developed. At greater depths, the signal is dominated by the temporal response of the detectors, which was approximated by an analytical expression. The depolarization caused by aerosols in the atmosphere was calculated and eliminated as a possible artifact...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{data are}} {{presented}} on dual-wavelength scattering characteristics of subtropical rain observed during the convection and precipitation/electrification (CaPE) experiment. Linear depolarization ratios (LDRs) are calculated at both X-band and Ka-band channels. In stratiform rain, the cross-polarized return signal is generally below {{the noise level}} except within the melting layer where the maximum LDR at both frequencies is typically between - 12 and - 10 dB. In convective rain the range profiles of the LDR in X-band and those in Ka-band do not coincide. The X-band LDR values in convective rain typically remain smaller than - 25 dB at high altitudes and take somewhat larger values of - 25 to - 15 dB at low altitudes. The Ka-band LDR values, in contrast, typically increase with radar range, sometimes reaching a level of - 3 dB just before the <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>signal</b> falls below the noise level. Such high values of LDR in Ka-band are most likely attributable to multiple scattering effects...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is demonstrated}} {{to exploit the}} polarization sensitivity of high-resolution radar measurements to interpret and quantify upper ocean dynamics. This study particularly illustrates the potential of quad-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements. The analysis relies on essential characteristics of the electromagnetic scattering mechanisms and hydrodynamical principles. As the relaxation scale of centimeter-scale ocean surface scatters is typically small, radar signal anomalies associated with surface manifestations of the upper ocean dynamics on spatial scales exceeding 100 m are mostly dominated by nonresonant and nonpolarized scatters. These “scalar” contributions can thus efficiently trace local breaking and near-breaking areas, caused by surface current variations. Using dual copolarized measurements, the polarized Bragg-type radar scattering is isolated by considering the difference (PD) between vertically and horizontally polarized radar signals. The nonpolarized (NP) contribution associated with wave breaking is then deduced, using the measured polarization ratio (PR) between polarized signals. Considering SAR scenes depicting various surface manifestations of the upper ocean dynamics (internal waves, mesoscale surface current features, and SST front), the proposed methodology and set of decompositions (PD, PR, and NP) efficiently enable the discrimination between surface manifestation of upper ocean dynamics and wind field variability. Applied to quad-polarized SAR images, such decompositions further provide unique opportunities to more directly assess the cross-polarized (CP for HV or VH) signal sensitivity to surface roughness changes. As demonstrated, such an analysis unambiguously demonstrates and quantitatively evaluates the relative impact of breakers on <b>cross-polarized</b> <b>signals</b> under low to moderate wind conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{cross-polarization}} {{method has}} been used to eliminate the specular reflection and enhance the diffusive backscattering of fluorescence excitation light from tissue-like phantoms and skin tissue. We have demonstrated that the non-uniformity of excitation and collection of a fluorescence imaging system can be corrected by normalizing fluorescence <b>signal</b> to the <b>cross-polarized</b> reflection <b>signal</b> recorded from the same site. The ratio image of fluorescence vs, cross-polarized reflection provides a map of relative fluorescence yield over the tissue surface. This ratio imaging technique may hold the potential to detect early cancer, which usually starts from the superficial layer of tissue, based on the contrast in the fluorescence yield between early lesion and surrounding normal tissue.

40|$|The {{performance}} was studied of the 1. 6 GHz airborne scatterometer system {{which is used}} as one of several Johnson Space Center (JSC) microwave remote sensors to detect moisture content of soil. The system is analyzed with respect to its antenna pattern and coupling, the signal flow in the receiver data channels, and the errors in the signal outputs. The operational principle and {{the sensitivity of the}} system, as well as data handling are also described. The finite cross-polarized gains of all four 1. 6 GHz scatterometer antennae are found to have profound influence on the <b>cross-polarized</b> backscattered <b>signal</b> returns. If these signals are not analyzed properly, large errors could result in the estimate of the cross-polarized coefficient. It is also found necessary to make corrections to the variations of the aircraft parameters during data reduction in order to minimize the error in the coefficient estimate. Finally, a few recommendations are made to improve the overall performance of the scatterometer system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} an optical probe for cross-polarized reflected light measurements and investigated optical signals associated with electrophysiological activation in isolated lobster nerves. The cross-polarized baseline light intensity (structural signal) and the amplitude of the transient response to stimulation (functional signal) measured in reflected mode were {{dependent on the}} orientation of the nerve axis relative to the polarization plane of incident light. The maximum structural signal and functional response amplitude were observed at 45 °, and the ratio of functional to structural signals was approximately constant across orientations. Functional responses were measured in single trials in both transmitted and reflected geometries and responses had similar waveforms. Both structural and functional signals were an order of magnitude smaller in reflected than in transmitted light measurements, but functional responses had similar signal/noise ratios. We propose a theoretical model based on geometrical optics that is consistent with experimental results. In the model, the <b>cross-polarized</b> structural <b>signal</b> results from light reflection from axonal fibers and the transient functional response arises from axonal swelling associated with neural activation. Polarization-sensitive reflected light measurements could greatly enhance in vivo imaging of neural activation since cross-polarized responses are much larger than scattering signals now employed for dynamic functional neuroimaging...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to the {{characterization}} of vector phase-sensitive amplifiers and processors. A detailed analysis of degenerate vector phase-sensitive amplifier (PSA) is performed. The gain and phase-sensitive extinction ratio are theoretically analyzed using three-wave theory. Experiments and simulation results confirm the validity of this three-wave theory. The influence of polarization-mode dispersion is also evaluated, showing that aligning the pump polarizations at the fiber input is essential in order to achieve the theoretically predicted results. The scheme is also compared to the degenerate scalar PSA scheme. At the same pump power, the vector PSA has lower gain but also less influence from higher-order idlers and lower pump depletion due to FWM between the pumps. Using the degenerate vector PSA, phase-sensitive (PS) amplification of dual-polarization (DP) binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) signals was demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first demonstration of a DP-modulated signal with large net phase-sensitive gain. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that this scheme can phase regenerate the signal. The same scheme was also used for a different purpose: quadrature decomposition into two cross-polarized waves. We demonstrated demultiplexing of quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) <b>signal</b> into two <b>cross-polarized</b> BPSK <b>signals</b> by the operating the amplifier in phase-insensitive mode. The design of a novel phase-locked loop scheme enabled stable operation and negligible penalty in the decomposition...|$|R
