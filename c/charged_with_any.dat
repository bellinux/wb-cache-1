5|$|In November, {{the three}} {{principal}} Bundy investigators—Jerry Thompson from Utah, Robert Keppel from Washington, and Michael Fisher from Colorado—met and exchanged information with 30 detectives and prosecutors from five states in Aspen, Colorado. While officials left the meeting (later {{known as the}} Aspen Summit) convinced that Bundy was the murderer they sought, they agreed that more hard evidence would be needed before he could be <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> of the murders.|$|E

50|$|In heraldry, {{the term}} star may refer to <b>any</b> star-shaped <b>charge</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> number of rays, which may appear {{straight}} or wavy, and {{may or may}} not be pierced. While there has been much confusion between the two due to their similar shape, a star with straight-sided rays is usually called a mullet while one with wavy rays is usually called an estoile.|$|R
5|$|He {{has never}} been <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> crime due to {{apparent}} mental inculpability. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration is that of forced medication. Weston has thus far refused to take any medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, {{in order to protect}} him from the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days. He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008, Speight found Collins's body in {{the bath}} of their shared London flat. He was arrested on {{suspicion}} of her murder, but not <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> offence. An inquest later determined that Collins {{had died of a}} drug overdose and severe burns from hot water. In April that year, Speight was reported missing and was later discovered to have taken his own life by hanging himself near Paddington station. Two suicide notes were discovered, describing how he could no longer live without Collins.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{continued}} to succeed {{upon entering the}} NFL in 1950, winning the championship that year and reaching the title game in both 1951 and 1952. In January 1951, McBride testified in nationally televised hearings before the Kefauver Committee, where he was questioned about his Continental Press Service and alleged ties to organized crime and illegal gambling. It emerged that McBride partnered with Cleveland police captain John Fleming in real estate deals and had Fleming on the Yellow Cab payroll until 1941. McBride denied the mafia connections, claimed he never broke the law and was never <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> crime. Congress later passed legislation making such wire services illegal.|$|E

5|$|Lay {{pleaded not}} guilty to the eleven {{criminal}} charges, and claimed that he was misled by those around him. He attributed the main cause for the company's demise to Fastow. Lay was convicted of all six counts of securities and wire fraud for which he had been tried, and he was subject to a maximum total sentence of 45 years in prison. However, before sentencing was scheduled, Lay died on July 5, 2006. At the time of his death, the SEC had been seeking more than $90 million from Lay in addition to civil fines. The case of Lay's wife, Linda, is a difficult one. She sold roughly 500,000 shares of Enron ten minutes to thirty minutes before the information that Enron was collapsing went public on November 28, 2001. Linda was never <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> of the events related to Enron.|$|E
5|$|He {{ended the}} 2005 season on a {{positive}} note by winning the gold medal in the 200m at the World Athletics Final, his first major championship title. His time of 19.96s was his second fastest that year and fourth fastest of any sprinter that season. Although he stated that the quality of the competition and memories of Helsinki had made him nervous beforehand, he went on to beat all three American sprinters he had lost to in the World Championships, becoming the first athlete to beat Gatlin over 200m that season. It was not only his rival sprinters that would cause future difficulties, however, as Gay's coach Brauman was indicted for various crimes relating to his time at Barton College and the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He had helped athletes gain funds and credits that they were not entitled to. Following Gay's testimony, the courts ruled that Brauman was guilty and, as a result, Arkansas' two NCAA titles and all of Gay's college track times were annulled. None of the athletes were <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> wrongdoing. Although he was imprisoned for 10 months, Brauman continued to train Gay, periodically updating him with coaching routines and techniques.|$|E
5|$|In June 1976, Gravel was {{the focus}} of a federal {{investigation}} into allegations that he was involved in a sex-for-vote arrangement. Congressional staff clerk Elizabeth Ray (who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of Representative Wayne Hays) stated that in August 1972, she had sex with Gravel aboard a houseboat on the Potomac River, under the instruction of Representative Kenneth J. Gray, her boss at the time. Gray allegedly wanted to secure Gravel's support for further funding for construction of the National Visitor Center in Washington, a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired. Another Congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter, but Gravel said {{at the time that he}} had never met either of the women. Both Gravel and Gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation, and neither was ever <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> wrongdoing. Decades later, Gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with Ray, but had not changed any votes because of it.|$|E
50|$|Forrest {{was accused}} of war crimes at the Battle of Fort Pillow for {{allegedly}} allowing forces under his command to massacre hundreds of black Union Army and white Southern Unionist prisoners.

5000|$|They escape downriver on Spenser's rowboat, {{eventually}} leading Luke Haden to his death. Spenser's {{father and}} uncles {{tell him he}} [...] "did good" [...] and needn't report the death, or his role in it. But he does, but the local law enforcement doesn't <b>charge</b> Spenser <b>with</b> <b>any</b> crime.|$|R
5|$|While Parke's {{conviction}} cleared Euston, another {{trial began}} on 16 December 1889 when Newlove's and Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, {{was charged with}} obstruction of justice. It was alleged that he conspired to prevent Hammond and the boys from testifying by offering or giving them passage and money to go abroad. Newton was defended by Charles Russell, who had prosecuted Ernest Parke, and the prosecutor was Sir Richard Webster, the Attorney General. Newton pleaded guilty {{to one of the}} six charges against him, claiming that he had assisted Hammond to flee merely to protect his clients, who were not at that time <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> offence or under arrest, from potential blackmail. The Attorney General accepted Newton's pleas and did not present any evidence on the other five charges. On 20 May, the judge, Sir Lewis Cave, sentenced Newton to six weeks in prison, which was widely considered by members of the legal profession to be harsh. A petition signed by 250 London law firms was sent to the Home Secretary, Henry Matthews, protesting at Newton's treatment.|$|E

On 12 October, Zimbabwe government officials said Palmer's papers were in order and Palmer would not be <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> crime. They said he was free to return to Zimbabwe as a tourist but not as a hunter.|$|E

50|$|Although {{unable to}} <b>charge</b> Jeffries <b>with</b> <b>any</b> serious offence apart from keeping a disorderly house, the Commission {{expected}} much publicity {{from the case}} when presenting their evidence. For example, a former housemaid testified that she witnessed an assault on a 13-year-old girl who had been whipped by a belt and raped by a customer.|$|R

He was invited back to Duke to continue his studies later that summer.|$|E
25|$|While being interrogated, García {{claimed that}} the two men had merely {{attempted}} to rape her. Her Catholic sensibilities and sense of shame prevented her from revealing the whole truth.
