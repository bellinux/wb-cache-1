5|$|Since 2012, Federal Cartridge Company {{produces}} a 5.7×28mm round under their American Eagle brand. Designated the AE5728A, this cartridge uses a 40-grain total metal jacket (TMJ) projectile, that is atypical {{in that it}} does not use a <b>copper</b> <b>plated</b> bullet; sectioned pictures show a very thick full copper jacket. The AE5728A casings are of FN manufacture, and the muzzle velocity is slightly lower than that of the SS197SR.|$|E
25|$|When {{polishing}} brass (a softer metal) {{there are}} often minute marks in the metal caused by impurities. To smooth out the finer marks, the surface is polished with a very fine (600) grit, <b>copper</b> <b>plated,</b> then buffed to a mirror finish with an airflow mop.|$|E
25|$|<b>Copper</b> <b>plated</b> with {{nickel and}} gold is often used. The thin gold layer {{facilitates}} good solderability of nickel as it protects the nickel from oxidation; the layer {{has to be}} thin enough to rapidly and completely dissolve so bare nickel is exposed to the solder.|$|E
30|$|The Y-shaped CNFs were {{synthesized}} by ethanol {{catalytic combustion}} (ECC). The process of ECC {{is described as}} follows: <b>copper</b> <b>plates</b> were employed as substrates, nickel nitrate, nickel chloride, and iron nitrate as catalyst precursors, and ethanol as both carbon source and fuel to provide energy for CNF growth. <b>Copper</b> <b>plates</b> were ultrasonically washed in acetone for several minutes. Catalyst precursors were dissolved in absolute ethanol to form saturated precursor solutions. Then some drops of catalyst precursor solution were dripped to cleaned surface of <b>copper</b> <b>plates.</b> After dried naturally, the coated <b>copper</b> <b>plate</b> was inserted into ethanol flames. The substrates stayed in ethanol flames for about 10 min. At last, wool-like deposits {{were found on the}} surface of <b>copper</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this work, a <b>copper</b> <b>plating</b> {{formula that}} can {{directly}} and selectively fill the through silicon holes (TSHs) for 3 D chip stacking packaging was developed. The <b>copper</b> <b>plating</b> technology reduced and simplified the process steps for fabricating through silicon vias (TSVs) and TSHs. The highly selectivity of copper {{fill in the}} TSHs also reduced the manufacture cost of 3 D chip stacking packaging, because the <b>copper</b> <b>plating</b> technology reduced the loading of a post-copper chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) and did not need a post-thermal annealing treatment. The <b>copper</b> <b>plating</b> formula was very simple, just containing single organic additive...|$|R

25|$|With {{their high}} copper content (97%), the {{intrinsic}} value of pre-1992 1p and 2p coins increased with {{the surge in}} metal prices of the mid-2000s, until by 2006 the coins would, if melted down, have been worth about 50% more than their face value. (To do this, however, would be illegal, {{and they would have}} had to be melted in huge quantities, using quite a bit of energy, to achieve significant gain.) In later years, the price of copper fell considerably. <b>Copper</b> <b>plated</b> steel coins were introduced to replace them.|$|E

25|$|Gravure {{printing}} is an {{intaglio printing}} technique, where the image being printed {{is made up}} of small depressions in the surface of the printing plate.

Then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing cylinders are usually made from <b>copper</b> <b>plated</b> steel, which is subsequently chromed, and may be produced by diamond engraving; etching, or laser ablation.|$|E
25|$|The Ball 4.6×30mm {{cartridge}} weighs 7g and {{is loaded}} with a 2.7g Full Metal Jacket projectile with a PbSb – alloy core and a steel <b>copper</b> <b>plated</b> jacket that achieves 600m/s (2,000ft/s) muzzle velocity. The cartridge is designed for the MP7. This ammunition is optimized for energy transfer in soft targets and should offer good precision. The muzzle velocity V0 and V100 indicate a G1 ballistic coefficient of approximately 0.171 to 0.187 (BC's are somewhat debatable). At the stated effective range of 200m the 2.7g Ball projectile will be travelling at approximately Mach 1.36 (463m/s) under ICAO Standard Atmosphere conditions at sea level (air density ρ=1.225kg/m3).|$|E

5000|$|The Irda <b>Copper</b> <b>plate</b> (Irda Tamarapatra) {{is another}} source on the Kamboja-Pala dynasty and was {{discovered}} in 1931. It is written in Sanskrit and has 49 lines of text in ancient Bengali script. The Vamsa or the tribal identity of the rulers mentioned in the Irda <b>Copper</b> <b>Plate</b> is specifically stated to be Kamboja-Vamsha-Tilaka (i.e. Ornament of the Kamboja family or Glory of the Kamboja tribe). Like the Dinajpore Pillar Inscriptions, the Irda <b>Copper</b> <b>plate</b> is also thought {{to belong to the}} second half of tenth century (Dr N. G. Majumdar, Dr R. C. Majumdar).

These [...] "steel pennies" [...] {{are not likely to}} be found in circulation today, as they were later intentionally removed from circulation for recycling the metal. However, cents minted from 1944 to 1946 were made from a special salvaged WWII brass composition to replace the steel cents, but still save material for the war effort, and are more common in circulation than their 1943 counterparts.|$|E
2500|$|The German Army {{version of}} the 4.6×30mm {{cartridge}} (DM11 Penetrator) weighs 6.5g and uses a 2g <b>copper</b> <b>plated</b> steel bullet projectile at [...] muzzle velocity. The DM11 Penetrator cartridge is designed for the MP7. The Ultimate Combat can penetrate the NATO CRISAT target at more than 300 meters. This ammunition should combine energy transfer in soft targets and very good penetration. The muzzle velocity V0 and V100 indicate a G1 ballistic coefficient of approximately 0.141 to 0.150 (BC's are somewhat debatable) making the DM11 projectile aerodynamically more efficient compared to typical service handgun projectiles, but less efficient compared to typical assault rifle projectiles. At the stated effective range of 200m the DM11 projectile will be travelling at approximately Mach 1.25 (425m/s) under ICAO Standard Atmosphere conditions at sea level (air density ρ=1.225kg/m3).|$|E

2500|$|The Madala Panji {{observes that}} Neela Madhav {{transformed}} into Jagannath and was worshipped alone as a unitary figure, {{not as the}} part of a triad. It is significant to note that the early epigraphic and literary sources refer only to a unitary deity Purushottama Jagannath. The Sanskrit play [...] "Anargharaghava" [...] composed by Murari mentioned only Purushottama Jagannath and his consort Lakshmi with no references to Blabhadra and Subhadra. The Dasgoba <b>copper</b> <b>plated</b> inscription dating to 1198 also mentions only Purushottama Jagannath in the context that the Puri temple had been originally built by Ganga king Anantavarman Chodaganga (1078–1147) for Vishnu and Lakshmi. These sources are silent on the existence of Balabhadra and Subhadra. Such state of affairs has led to arguments that Purushottama was the original deity and Balabhadra and Subhadra were subsequently drawn in as additions to a unitary figure and formed a triad.|$|E
2500|$|E.N.V.'s V-8 engines {{appeared}} in six different models. [...] Most {{of these were}} identified by a letter, though contemporary sources often refer to them by power.
