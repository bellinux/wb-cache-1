5|$|Other themes include <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> coincidence. During Chasing Vermeer, Charles Fort's book, Lo!, inspires the {{children}} to list {{and pay attention to}} coincidences as they realize that they are more than what they seem and explore the concept that they make up one unexplained pattern. Balliett stated that she wanted to convey how coincidences were noticeable and felt meaningful, and how they could matter even if they were unexplainable.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{to college}} the next year, Chance led {{his team to}} a third-place finish in an amateur tournament of 50 teams. Bill Lange of the Chicago Cubs {{discovered}} <b>Chance</b> <b>and</b> convinced the Cubs to sign him as a backup catcher and outfielder, receiving $1,200 a year ($ in current dollar terms). Chance was scouted by other teams, but chose the Cubs as Tim Donohue was the only catcher ahead of him on the Cubs' depth chart.|$|E

5|$|The film's opening voiceover from Wilton {{introduces}} its {{themes of}} <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> fate, which he characterises as simple luck, to him all-important. The sequence establishes the protagonist as an introvert, {{a man who}} mediates his experience of the world through deliberation, and positions the film's subjective perspective through his narrative eyes. Charalampos Goyios argued that this hero, as an opera lover, maintains a sense of distance from the outer world and that ramifications therein {{pale in comparison to}} the purity of interior experience.|$|E
5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> applied {{himself to the}} task with determination. Because he had destroyed all his output {{of the last three}} years, he {{had little choice but to}} present new works. He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show, but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition, completing the series barely in time for the opening.|$|E
5|$|Bavaro {{struggled}} with a degenerative knee condition throughout the 1990 season and was rarely able to practice. The Giants cut him in July 1991 {{because of the}} injury. After some initial dispute, the Giants signed him to a one-year US$310,000 contract and placed him on the physically unable to perform list. He spent the season as a tight end coach at Saint Dominic Savio High School in East Boston, Massachusetts. He took the position after the team's coach took a <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> wrote Bavaro a letter to {{ask him if he}} would consider coaching.|$|E

5|$|Charles Robert Forbes (February 14, 1878 – April 10, 1952) was {{appointed}} the first Director of the Veterans' Bureau by President Warren G. Harding on August 9, 1921 and served until February 28, 1923. Caught for army desertion in 1900, {{he returned to}} the military and was a decorated World War I veteran. He first became active in politics in the Pacific Northwest. In 1912, Forbes moved to Hawaii and served as chairman on various federal commissions. While Senator Warren G. Harding was on vacation in Hawaii the two met by <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> became friends. After the 1920 U.S. Presidential election, President Harding appointed Forbes director to the newly created Veterans' Bureau, a powerful position in charge {{of millions of dollars in}} government expenditures and supplies.|$|E
5|$|Florida State earned its bid to the ACC Championship game by {{fighting}} through an Atlantic Division schedule that included several nationally ranked teams. After defeating ninth-ranked Miami in their opening contest, the Seminoles won their next four games before losing at Virginia {{in a close}} match. Additional losses to North Carolina State and Clemson {{at the end of}} the season almost eliminated the Seminoles from contention for a spot in the championship game, but losses by Clemson and the other Atlantic Division leaders gave the Seminoles a second <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> set up an ACC Championship game between Florida State and Virginia Tech. The two teams had previously played in the 2000 National Championship Game, and the rematch served as a point of public interest.|$|E
5|$|Further complicating {{this picture}} are {{repetition}} patterns. There {{are two types}} of repetition in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in mamari, and grammatical reduplication of disyllables, as seen in rongorongo. In the Rapanui lexicon, double syllables as in mamari are 50% more likely than chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% more likely than chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated disyllables such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance, constituting a quarter of the vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only twice as likely as <b>chance,</b> <b>and</b> 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs to be explained. Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that modifications of glyphs, such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right, may have indicated repetition.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{was also}} notable {{in his time}} for his extravagant lifestyle. The deaths {{of his father and}} elder brother while he was still a young man {{provided}} Harvey with a considerable fortune, much of which he squandered gambling in London. Harvey's exploits at the gaming tables became legendary, one story claiming that he once bet £100,000 on a single game of <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> lost, only to win most of it back on the following throw. Despite his dissolute lifestyle, Harvey was married and had numerous children; he was survived by six daughters and had three sons who predeceased him.|$|E
5|$|However, {{with the}} very poor results of the federal United Australia Party under Billy Hughes at the 1943 Federal election, the UAP disintegrated. A large number of former UAP members then formed the Democratic Party in New South Wales, led by Mair, who became Opposition Leader, while others moved into the Commonwealth Party and the Liberal Democratic Party. The Democratic Party then merged with the Commonwealth Party in January 1944. With the {{conservative}} vote split in half, Mair had little <b>chance,</b> <b>and</b> resigned as Democratic Party Leader on 10 February 1944, {{to be replaced by}} Weaver, who then became Party Leader and Leader of the Opposition. Weaver then led the party to the 1944 election where it won 19% of the vote and 12 of the 90 seats in the Legislative Assembly. Weaver himself retained his seat with 56.90%.|$|E
5|$|In Original Stories, Wollstonecraft {{employed}} the then-burgeoning genre of children's literature {{to promote the}} education of women and an emerging middle-class ideology. She argued that women {{would be able to}} become rational adults if they were educated properly as children, which was not a widely held belief in the 18th century, and contended that the nascent middle-class ethos was superior to the court culture represented by fairy tales and to the values of <b>chance</b> <b>and</b> luck found in chapbook stories for the poor. Wollstonecraft, in developing her own pedagogy, also responded to the works of the two most important educational theorists of the 18th century: John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E
