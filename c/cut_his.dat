5|$|Bai Ling filmed minor scenes for {{the film}} playing a senator, but her role was cut during editing.

5|$|Screenwriter Frances Marion, {{who would}} win two Oscars in the 1930s, penned {{ten of the}} FBO {{pictures}} starring her husband, Fred Thomson. Editor Pandro S.

5|$|Sheldon goes {{to get a}} haircut; {{his usual}} barber Mr. D'Onofrio is in a coma, so the barber's nephew Angelo (Peter Onorati) is there instead.

5|$|Stephen {{was furious}} {{over what he}} saw as {{potentially}} precedent-setting papal interference in his royal authority, and initially refused to allow Murdac into England. When Theobald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, went to consult with the Pope on the matter against Stephen's wishes, the King refused to allow him back into England either, and seized his estates. Stephen also <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> links to the Cistercian order, and turned instead to the Cluniacs, of which Henry was a member.|$|E

5|$|The 2010–11 NBA season started {{badly for}} the Rockets, who lost {{the first five}} games. In the seventh, Yao Ming injured his left ankle in what was just his fifth game that season.

5|$|A short interregnum followed, {{during which}} {{ownership}} {{was transferred to}} J.W. Skaggs. Skaggs continued to push Alexander's Democratic Party/states' rights agenda during his short five weeks at the helm. The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload his newly acquired white elephant. He <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> losses and avoided the stigma of financial failure for himself and the conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later recollection, Skaggs sweetened the transfer of ownership by tossing in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for the new owners.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he was a}} {{newcomer}} to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting {{to be taken seriously}} as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E

5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one to his room, and used it to <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help, but nothing could be done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E
5|$|James then flew to Algiers, {{where he}} was {{publicly}} paraded through the airport and driven to meet General Maitland Wilson, ostensibly for a meeting to discuss operations against the south of France. Instead, he was moved quietly to a remote villa by 'A' Force's Rex Hamer. Rumours suggest this was because James had been spotted smoking and staggering around Algiers, so the deceivers decided to <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> appearances short. Whatever the reason, the next day, out of character, James was flown to Cairo. He was to remain hidden there until the public disclosure of Montgomery's presence in France. Meanwhile, double agents in North Africa were used to extend the masquerade {{for a few more}} days, by hinting Montgomery was still in the region.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{was arrested}} {{when he arrived}} at Changi Airport on the evening of 19 March 1995 and {{produced}} a passport with his assumed name, Simon Davis.

In a police interview room in the airport, Martin smashed a glass panel and <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> wrist with a shard of glass in a suicide attempt, fearing that he would be hanged like Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino who had been hanged two days before for a double murder. He was taken to Alexandra Hospital for treatment.|$|E

The fight was postponed on February 2, after Kirkland <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> nose, this was later revealed as a fracture, eventually cancelling the card.|$|E
5|$|On 27 November 1880, Boycott, {{his family}} and a local {{magistrate}} were escorted from Lough Mask House {{by members of the}} 19th Hussars. A carriage had been hired for the family, but no driver could be found for it, and an army ambulance and driver had to be used. The ambulance was escorted to Claremorris railway station, where Boycott and his family boarded a train to Dublin, where Boycott was received with some hostility. The hotel he stayed in received letters saying that it would be boycotted if Boycott remained. He had intended to stay in Dublin for a week, but Boycott was advised to <b>cut</b> <b>his</b> stay short. He left Dublin for England on the Holyhead mail boat on 1 December.|$|E
5|$|Orr {{became an}} agent {{representing}} hockey players in 1996. Along with investors, Orr purchased the Woolf Associates agency founded by Boston lawyer Bob Woolf.

Orr became a certified agent, although he would not be negotiating with hockey clubs. Player agent Rick Curran merged his agency with Orr's in 2000.
