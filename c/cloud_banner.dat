40|$|Two mistral events {{observed}} in 1999 during the Mesoscale Alpine Programme (MAP) are studied using observational data and high-resolution mesoscale-model simulations from the US Navy’s Coupled Ocean Atmos-phere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS). Radiosondes suggested that both mistral wind events {{were associated with}} the passage of cold fronts and post-frontal air descent. EuroSat Rapidscan images indicated a stationary and persistent cloud edge along the lee of the Massif Central. The cloud edge marks the beginning of mistral ow acceleration and descent according to COAMPS simulations. Narrow persistent cloud banners were identi ed trailing from the Mont Lozére in the Massif Central during both mistral events. COAMPS indicated that these cloud banners were associated with a deeper turbulent boundary layer in wakes induced by hydraulic jumps. The <b>cloud</b> <b>banner</b> and wake de ned the western boundary of the mistral. Analysis of dropsonde data and in situ ight data indicated the presence of a sharp shear line separating the cold severe mistral wind from the warm calm wake ow to the lee of the French Alps. Trajectory analysis of model data suggested that air parcels on {{the two sides of the}} shear line had different histories...|$|E

40|$|Systematic {{observations}} of <b>banner</b> <b>clouds</b> at Mount Zugspitze in the Bavarian Alps are presented and discussed. One set of observations draws on daily time lapse movies, which were taken {{over several years}} at this mountain. Identifying <b>banner</b> <b>clouds</b> {{with the help of}} these movies and using simultaneous {{observations of}} standard variables at the summit of the mountain provides climatological information regarding the <b>banner</b> <b>clouds.</b> In addition, a week-long measurement campaign with an entire suite of instruments was carried through yielding a comprehensive set of data for two specific <b>banner</b> <b>cloud</b> events. The duration of <b>banner</b> <b>cloud</b> events has a long-tailed distribution with a mean of about 40 min. The probability of occurrence has both a distinct diurnal and a distinct seasonal cycle, with a maximum in the afternoon and in the warm season, respectively. These cycles appear to correspond closely to analogous cycles of relative humidity, which maximize in the late afternoon and during the warm season. In addition, the dependence of <b>banner</b> <b>cloud</b> occurrence on wind speed is weak. Both results suggest that moisture conditions are a key factor for <b>banner</b> <b>cloud</b> occurrence. The distribution of wind direction during <b>banner</b> <b>cloud</b> events slightly deviates from climatology, suggesting an influence from the specific Zugspitz orography. The two <b>banner</b> <b>cloud</b> events during the campaign have a number of common features: the windward and the leeward side are characterized by different wind regimes, however, with mean upward flow on both sides; the leeward air is both moister and warmer than the windward air; the background atmosphere has an inversion just above the summit of Mt. Zugspitze; the lifting condensation level increases with altitude. The results are discussed, and it is argued that they are consistent with previous Large Eddy Simulations using idealized orography...|$|R
