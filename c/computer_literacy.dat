40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{account for more}} {{attention}} to computer games as a cultural phenomenon that can be taught about. Due to the overemphasis on computer games as either causes of aggression and addiction, or the new means to educate our curriculum content, an elaborated concept of <b>computer</b> game <b>literacy</b> education, i. e. teaching about computer games, has not been developed yet. Media education, to which {{the idea of the}} ‘constructedness’ of all media is central, can serve as a framework for teaching about computer games. Its two pillars of critical reflection and personal media production can apply to <b>computer</b> game <b>literacy</b> education. However, since computer games are, next to media - with their own medium specificities - also ludic configurations, the theory needs to be adjusted. From the infant theory on <b>computer</b> game <b>literacy</b> education it becomes clear that the twofold nature of computer games as both representational media and rule-based systems {{is at the core of}} <b>computer</b> game <b>literacy</b> education. Furthermore, attention to the increased responsibility of players, as a result of the interactive nature of computer games, plays an important part. Both the small field of <b>computer</b> game <b>literacy</b> education and the broader field of new media literacies mostly stress the production part, while critical reflection receives less attention. For that reason, I argue for a particular kind of computer game that could teach critical reflection by commenting on its own built-in assumptions. I therefore look into the so-called epic theater of German theater practitioner and theorist Bertolt Brecht. He tried to accomplish a critical attitude to his audience by emphasizing the artificiality of his plays, rather than to present the depicted world as natural and unalterable. In order to bring about a critical distance, he employed so-called alienation effects, which were to accomplish a feeling of estrangement. Since both theater and computer games are representations of actions, and thereby have the ability to simulate, a translation from one domain to the other proves fruitful. Two of Brecht’s alienation effects, the break of the fourth wall and the separation of the elements, are particularly suitable for a translation to computer games. I provide several examples of how these elements manifest themselves in computer games, elaborating on the effects these epic elements can bring about and how they can serve <b>computer</b> game <b>literacy</b> education...|$|R

However, being part of a joint design process, in a welcome environment, with materials that ease the participants’ expression (as drawings, cards, pictures), enriches the designer view for the context, promoting the design of solutions that make sense for the users. In particular, considering the design for diversity, being in contact with people with different ability levels using <b>computers,</b> <b>literacy</b> levels, ages, strategies to communication etc., demystifies the need for a “welfarist” approach, which can label and inhibit; on the contrary it enhances the respect for the differences and a commitment to design solutions that promote the social and intellectual growth of users.|$|R

25|$|Although most {{electrical}} engineers will understand basic circuit theory (that is {{the interactions of}} elements such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and inductors in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, quantum mechanics and solid state physics might be relevant to an engineer working on VLSI (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even circuit theory may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use off-the-shelf components.

25|$|The {{concept that}} video games are {{a form of}} art {{is one that has}} begun to gain force in the later half of the 2000s with the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts {{recognizing}} games as a form of art in May 2011, for example. In viewing video games as cultural artifacts and the industry as a cultural industry, the disenfranchisement of women from the medium is regarded as negatively impacting the female voice in the industry and the woman's capacity {{to take part in the}} cultural dialogue that gaming inspires. From an education perspective, certain gaming genres particularly lacking in female players such as the first-person shooter game have been shown to increase spatial skills thereby giving advantages to players of the games that are currently skewed along gender lines. Video games have also been determined to provide an easy lead-in to <b>computer</b> <b>literacy</b> for children and correlations have been drawn between male video gaming and the predominance of male workers within the computer industry. With the increasing importance of tech jobs in the 21st century and the increased role of online networking, the lack of female video game players suggests a loss of future career opportunities for women.|$|E
