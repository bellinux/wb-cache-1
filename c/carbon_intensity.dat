40|$|This paper {{examines}} CO 2 emissions {{embodied in}} Japan-China trade. Besides directly quantifying {{the flow of}} CO 2 emissions {{between the two countries}} by using a traditional input-output (IO) model, this study also estimates the effect of bilateral trade to CO 2 emissions by scenario analysis. The time series of quantifications indicate that CO 2 emissions embodied in exported goods from Japan to China increased overall from 1990 to 2000. The exported CO 2 emissions from China to Japan greatly increased {{in the first half of}} the 1990 s. However, by 2000, the amount of emissions had reduced from 1995 levels. Regardless, there was a net export of CO 2 emissions from China to Japan during 1990 - 2000. The scenario comparison shows that the bilateral trade has helped the reduction of CO 2 emissions. On average, the Chinese economy was confirmed to be much more carbon-intensive than Japan. The regression analysis shows a significant but not perfect correlation between the <b>carbon</b> <b>intensities</b> at the sector level of the two countries. In terms of CO 2 emission reduction opportunities, most sectors of Chinese industry could benefit from learning Japanese technologies that produce lower <b>carbon</b> <b>intensities.</b> CO 2 embodiment Japan-China trade Quantitative estimation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: While some {{countries}} have achieved considerable development, many others still lack {{access to the}} goods and services considered standard in the modern society. As CO 2 emissions and develop-ment are often correlated, this paper employs the theoretical background of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) and the learning curves toolkit to analyze how <b>carbon</b> <b>intensities</b> have changed as countries move towards higher development (and cumulative wealth) levels. The EKC concept is then tested with the methodology of learning curves for the period between 1971 and 2010, so as to capture a dynamic picture of emissions trends and development. Results of both analyses reveal that empirical data fails to provide direct evidence of an EKC for emissions and development. The data does show, however, an interesting pattern in the dispersion of emissions levels for countries within the same HDI categories. While data does not show that countries grow more polluting during intermediary development stages, it does provide evidence that countries become more heterogeneous in their emission intensities as they develop, later re-converging to lower emission intensities at higher HDI levels. Learning rates also indicate heterogeneity among developing countries and relative convergence among developed countries. Given the heterogeneity of development paths among countries, the experiences of those which are managing to develop at low <b>carbon</b> <b>intensities</b> can prove valuable examples for ongoing efforts in climate change mitigation, especially in the developing world...|$|R

40|$|Emissions {{embodied}} in provincial trade (EEPT) have important effects on provinces' responsibilities for carbon emission reductions. Based on a multi-regional input-output model, we calculated EEPT for China's 30 provinces in 2002, 2007 and 2010, and {{we attempted to}} determine the drivers of EEPT. The results showed that, during this period, the ratio of EEPT to production-based emissions increased over time, reaching 40. 24 % in 2010. In consideration of its important role in carbon emissions, we analyzed the factors attributable to EEPT through structure decomposition analysis. The decomposition results showed that final demand and <b>carbon</b> emission <b>intensity</b> were two major factors in EEPT, while the final demand in other provinces and the <b>carbon</b> emission <b>intensity</b> in the local province were major factors for Emissions {{embodied in}} provincial exports and the final demand in the local province and the <b>carbon</b> emission <b>intensity</b> in other provinces were major factors for Emissions embodied in provincial imports.

40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} {{variations}} of embodied energy (EE) and <b>carbon</b> (EC) <b>intensities</b> {{of materials and}} identifies their parameter variations in hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA). These parameters include energy tariff, primary energy factor, disaggregation constant, emission factor, and price fluctuation. Hybrid LCA has been conducted to expand the system boundary by filling the gaps in traditional LCA data inventories. The Malaysian Input Output(IO) tables are used to derive indirect energy and <b>carbon</b> <b>intensities</b> which are then combined to take advantages of detailed process LCA. The results revealed that maximum increase in energy tariffs and material price fluctuations were the key parameters and issues leading to higher variations in EE and EC intensity values. Other parameters - such as maximum increase in primary energy factor, emission factor and excluding disaggregation constant - have a slight impact upon EE and EC intensity variations. Building materials with high indirect energy in the upstream boundary of materials production have high influence on hybrid LCA variation. Therefore, any decision relating to these materials should be considered carefully. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{importance}} of linkages between the Swiss economy and other regions (especially Western Europe) for Switzerland’s CO 2 profile.

The carbon footprint of territorial production decreased during 1997 – 2011, whereas the carbon footprint of consumption remained quite steady and the footprint from final production increased over the same period. All <b>carbon</b> <b>intensities</b> have decreased, however, though the differential between territorial production and final production and consumption has remained the same. These findings highlight the role of emissions embodied in trade flows, particularly with the group of developed members of the European Union, for a small open economy like Switzerland.

25|$|In 2011, a {{provision}} {{was added to}} the LCFS that allows refiners to receive credits for the deployment of innovative crude production technologies, such as carbon capture and sequestration or solar steam generation. Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery is a form of enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which is key to harvesting California’s heavy crude. Currently, California uses EOR to help produce about 60% of its crude output. By using solar power instead of natural gas to create steam for EOR, solar steam generation reduces the amount of emissions produced during oil extraction, thus lowering the overall <b>carbon</b> <b>intensity</b> of crude. California currently has two solar EOR projects in operation, one in McKittrick, operated by LINN Energy (formerly Berry Petroleum) using enclosed trough technology from GlassPoint Solar, and another in Coalinga operated by Chevron Corporation using BrightSource Energy power tower technology.

40|$|Abstract: Microgeneration {{is being}} {{promoted}} {{as a means}} of lowering carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions by replacing electricity from the grid with production from small domestic genera-tors. One concern over this drive is that the use of smaller plant could lead to the loss of econ-omies of scale. Partly, this relates to cost but also in terms of energy consumed and CO 2 emitted over the life cycle of the microgenerator. Here, an analysis is presented of a life-cycle audit of the energy use and CO 2 emissions for the ‘SWIFT’, a 1. 5 kW rooftop-mounted, grid-connected wind turbine. The analysis shows that per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by the turbine, the energy intensity and CO 2 emissions are comparable with larger wind turbines and significantly lower than fossil-fuelled generation. With energy and <b>carbon</b> <b>intensities</b> sensitive to assumed levels of production, assessments were carried out for an annual production range of 1000 – 4000 kWh, representing capacity factors of 8 – 31 per cent. For the manufacturer’s estimated production of 2000 to 3000 kWh and, giving credit for component recycling, the energy payback period was found to be between 17 and 25 months, whereas the CO 2 payback was between 13 and 20 months. Across the full production range, the energy and carbon payback periods were 13 – 50 months and 10 – 39 months, respectively. A key outcome of the study is to inform the manufacturer of the opportunities for improving the energy and <b>carbon</b> <b>intensities</b> of the turbine.
