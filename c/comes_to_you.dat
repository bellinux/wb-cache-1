2500|$|In overview, {{the works}} for the double album in this period were {{intended}} to be packaged in a plain brown wrapper, with a [...] "strictly personal" [...] over-stamp and addressed {{in a manner that}} could have connotations of drug content, pornographic or illicit material; As per the small ads of the time: [...] "It <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in a plain brown wrapper." [...] Given that Krasnow had effectively poached the band from Buddah there were limitations on what material could be released. Strictly Personal was the result, contained in its enigmatically-addressed parcel sleeve. The raft of material left behind eventually emerged, firstly on CD as I May Be Hungry, But I Sure Ain't Weird and later on vinyl, implemented by John French, as It <b>Comes</b> <b>To</b> <b>You</b> in a Plain Brown Wrapper (which has two tracks that are missing from the former release). Both Blue Thumb and the stamps on the cover of Strictly Personal have LSD connotations, as does the track Ah Feel Like Ahcid, although Beefheart himself refuted this (claiming that this is a rendering of [...] "I feel like I said").|$|E

Originally {{intended to be a}} double album called It <b>Comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> in a Plain Brown Wrapper for the [...] label, it was released later in pieces in 1971 and 1995. After rejection from Buddah, Bob Krasnow encouraged the band to re-record four of the shorter numbers, add two more, and make shorter versions of [...] "Mirror Man" [...] and [...] "Kandy Korn". Krasnow created a strange mix full of [...] "phasing" [...] that, by most accounts (including Beefheart's), diminished the music's strength. This was released in October 1968 as Strictly Personal on Krasnow's Blue Thumb label. Stewart Mason in his Allmusic review of the album described it as a [...] "terrific album" [...] and a [...] "fascinating, underrated release... every bit the equal of Safe as Milk and Trout Mask Replica". Langdon Winner of Rolling Stone called Strictly Personal [...] "an excellent album. The guitars of the Magic Band mercilessly bend and stretch notes in a way that suggests that the world of music has wobbled clear off its axis," [...] with the lyrics demonstrating [...] "...Beefheart's ability to juxtapose delightful humor with frightening insights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Criticisms {{about the}} {{evidence}} {{used to justify}} the war notwithstanding, many opponents of military intervention objected, saying that a diplomatic solution would be preferable, and that war should be reserved as a truly last resort. This position was exemplified by French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin, who responded to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's 5 February 2003 presentation to the U.N Security Council by saying that: [...] "Given the choice between military intervention and an inspections regime that is inadequate because of a failure to cooperate on Iraq's part, we must choose the decisive reinforcement {{of the means of}} inspections." [...] In response to Donald Rumsfeld's reference to European countries that did not support the invasion of Iraq as 'Old Europe', Dominique de Villepin ended his speech with words that would later come to embody the French-German political, economic, and military alliance throughout the beginning of the 21st Century: [...] "This message <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> today from an old country, France, from a continent like mine, Europe, that has known wars, occupation and barbarity. (...) Faithful to its values, it wishes resolutely to act with {{all the members of the}} international community. It believes in our ability to build together a better world." [...] The direct opposition between diplomatic solution and military intervention involving France and the United States which was personified by Chirac versus Bush and later Powell versus de Villepin, became a milestone in the Franco-American relations. Anti-French propaganda exploiting the classic Francophobic clichés immediately ensued in the United States and the United Kingdom. A call for a boycott on French wine was launched in the United States and the New York Post covered on the 1944 [...] "Sacrifice" [...] of the GIs that France had forgotten. It was followed a week later, on 20 February, by the British newspaper The Sun publishing a special issue entitled [...] "Chirac is a worm" [...] and including ad hominem attacks such as [...] "Jacques Chirac has become the shame of Europe". Actually both newspapers expressed the opinion of their owner, U.S. billionaire Rupert Murdoch, a military intervention supporter and a George W. Bush partisan as argued by Roy Greenslade in The Guardian published on 17 February.|$|E
