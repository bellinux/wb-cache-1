5|$|<b>Chapman</b> and Vause get {{revenge on}} Doggett and trick her {{into believing that}} she has faith healing powers, {{eventually}} culminating in her {{being sent to the}} psychiatric ward. Although <b>Chapman</b> aids in Doggett's release from the psychiatric ward, Doggett still bears a grudge against her. Doggett's lawyer encourages her to evangelize to <b>Chapman</b> instead and this leads to <b>Chapman</b> 'converting' but then refusing to be baptized. Doggett sees this as disrespectful and expresses a wish to kill <b>Chapman.</b> The two have a confrontation {{at the end of the}} season's final episode. Doggett attacks <b>Chapman</b> with a shiv made from a wooden cross; <b>Chapman</b> throws Doggett to the ground and hits her repeatedly.|$|E
