This work was undertaken by the river authority. The drainage board built six pumping stations between 1975 and 1979. Improvements to the drainage channels brought the cost up to £839,000, although 70% of this was provided by grants. In the 1980s, a £1 million scheme resulted in further improvements to the drainage works, and two more pumping stations were built, at Crabley and Skelfleet Cloughs.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} experimentally and theoretically the resonant {{emission of}} single InAs/GaAs quantum dots in a planar microcavity. Due {{to the presence}} of at least one residual charge in the quantum dots, the resonant excitation of the neutral exciton is blocked. The influence of the residual doping on the initial quantum dots charge state is analyzed, and the resonant emission quenching is interpreted as a Coulomb blockade effect. The use of an additional non-resonant laser in a specific low power regime leads to the <b>carrier</b> <b>draining</b> in quantum dots and allows an efficient optical gating of the exciton resonant emission. A detailed population evolution model, developed to describe the <b>carrier</b> <b>draining</b> and the optical gate effect, perfectly fits the experimental results in the steady state and dynamical regimes of the optical gate with a single set of parameters.

5000|$|A leat, {{called a}} main, carrier or top carrier, {{was used to}} divert water from the river and carry it down the valley at a gentler slope than the river, {{producing}} a hydrostatic head between the two. Mains were often {{along the edge of}} the valley, each main supplying up to about 1 km of the valley. The water from the main was used to supply many smaller carriers, on the crests of ridges built across the fields. The channel on the crest of each ridge would overflow slowly down the sides (the panes) of the ridge, the channel eventually tapering to an end at the tip of the ridge. The seeping water would then be collected between the ridges, in drains or drawns, these joining to form a bottom <b>carrier</b> or tail <b>drain</b> which returned the water to the river. The ridges and the drains made an interlocking grid (like interlaced fingers), but the ridge-top channels and the drains did not connect directly. A by-carrier took any water not needed for irrigation straight from the main back to the river. The ridges varied in height depending on the available head [...] - [...] usually from around 10 to 50 cm.

50|$|A speedy {{switching}} device is an NPN avalanche transistor {{fitted with a}} coil between base and emitter. The transistor is initially switched off and about 300 volts exists across its collector-base junction. This voltage is high enough that a charge carrier in this region can create more carriers by impact ionisation, but the probability is too low to form a proper avalanche; instead a somewhat noisy leakage current flows. When the preceding stage switches, the emitter-base junction is pushed into forward bias and the collector-base junction enters full avalanche mode, so charge carriers injected into the collector-base region multiply in a chain reaction. Once the Marx generator has completely fired, voltages everywhere drop, each switch avalanche stops, its matched coil puts its base-emitter junction into reverse bias, and the low static field allows remaining charge <b>carriers</b> to <b>drain</b> out of its collector-base junction.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDrainback systems (DBS) were {{developed}} in the Netherlands in the 1980 's, due to governmental regulations regarding potable water quality. The crucial attribute of drainback systems is the draining of the working fluid from the collector - always when the solar circuit is not in operation. The draining ensures a protection against both, overheating and freezing of the circulating fluid in the solar loop. Small installation failures can disturb the desired filling/draining processes. This can lead not only to improperly operation, but even damage the DBS. Therefore the knowledge on behavior of the DBS during the filling and draining is essential for ensuring the proper operation. An experimental setup was developed in order to investigate the filling and draining processes of the drainback system. Two types of drainback systems were considered: system with drain-back reservoir and heat storage as drain-back reservoir. The first type has a separate, so-called drain-back reservoir which {{is located on the}} solar flow circle. The collector is hydraulically connected to the heat storage through an internal heat exchanger coil. In the second system type, the heat storage itself is the drain-back reservoir. The measurement equipment comprised magnetic-inductive flow meters, manometers and a data acquisition system. For additional visual assessments, almost all hydraulic components (tubes, collector's absorber, heat storage, drain-back reservoir) were made transparent and colored water was used as working fluid in the solar loop. Based on the dimensions of a real collector with a meander absorber its “imitator” was made of PVC pipes. The 100 liter heat storage and 25 liter drain-back reservoir were made of PP-H plastic. Different experiments were carried out and evaluated. The processes of filling and draining are described in detail in this paper. Results of this investigation are e. g. :•A siphon is a crucial effect for both filling and draining processes•A minimal hydrostatic height difference less than 10 mm between flow and return sides is sufficient for draining•The largest share of the heat <b>carrier</b> <b>drains</b> over the solar return pipe, caused by siphoned draining•Horizontal piping without slope does not disturb the draining processExplanations of these processes will be presented in the paper...|$|R

The active channel of the OFET contains a first generation dendrimer comprised of a spirobifluorene core, carbazole branching moieties, and fluorenyl surface groups. It is found that operating the device with pulsed gating reduces the bias stress and improves operational stability. p-Nitrotoluene (pNT) is used as the archetypical high electron affinity explosive analyte to demonstrate the sensing capability. Penetration and diffusion of pNT vapor into the dendrimer active channel is found to result in charge trapping and a resultant decrease of the <b>carrier</b> mobility and <b>drain</b> current. At room temperature the pNT is strongly bound to the dendrimer of the channel resulting in a prolonged and persistent response.

For example, in both dual-gate SOI MOSFETs and in FinFET devices, quantum mechanical size-quantization effects significantly affect the overall device behavior. In addition, unintentional doping leads to considerable fluctuation in the device parameters, and the electron-electron interactions affect the thermalization of the <b>carriers</b> at the <b>drain</b> end of the device.

40|$|For {{the past}} ten years, we’ve seen the rapid {{development}} of wireless communication along {{with the number of}} frequency bands to be supported in a wireless device. RF power amplifiers (PAs), as the last and most important stage in a transmitter, then have to support the increasing number of frequency bands and operation modes. The solution that has been used in industry is simply {{to increase the number of}} PAs with each of them covers several adjacent frequency bands. It might be feasible from 2 G to 4 G since the frequency range is confined within low GHz (3 ̆c 3 GHz), however, as 5 G comes, not only the number of frequency band will keep increasing, but the frequency range will expand to much higher ranges (6 GHz, 30 GHz, 60 GHz, etc.). Higher frequency range will need much more PAs and thus make the traditional solution impractical due to constrained cost and area. In addition, carrier aggregation technique used in 4 G and future 5 G requires additional filters (diplexer/triplexer) to combines different single-band PAs which will introduce extra power loss. Multi-band PAs that are able to operate at several frequency bands (not adjacent to each other) simultaneous could potentially reduce the number of PAs and filters thus making the increasingly complicate RF front end feasible in terms of area and cost with reduced power loss. Such PAs are defined as concurrent multi-band PAs. Unfortunately, traditional multi-band PAs were designed for operate one band at a time and thus experienced significant efficiency and output power drop when operate concurrently. A few concurrent dual-band PAs were designed in recent years targeting concurrent operation. However, the drop in both efficiency and output power were still too much to make those PAs useful in actual applications. The performance of existing concurrent dual-band PAs are mainly limited by their linear-type topology. In this thesis, a switch-mode concurrent dual-band PAs was developed for the first time which, as expected, could achieve higher efficiency with minimum drop in both efficiency and output power.

40|$|Transistors {{utilizing}} real space transfer (RST) {{have drawn}} significant attention because RST opens new avenues of transistor operation. They have potential for increased speed and functionality compared to conventional devices. The velocity modulation transistor (VMT) has a speed {{advantage over the}} high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) because its mode of switching differs. Rather than filling and emptying its primary conduction channel by moving carriers longitudinally from source to <b>drain,</b> <b>carriers</b> move transversely between high-speed and low-speed channels. Thus, the VMT {{can take advantage of}} epitaxially defined distances as opposed to lithographically defined distances. Epitaxially grown heterostructures have been designed and developed to support VMT technology. New dual- and triple-gated transistors have been developed in order to verify that electrons are actually moving between the two channels. Working VMTs have been designed, fabricated and tested in a GaAs/AlxGa 1 -xAs system. These transistors use a high mobility two-dimensional electron gas and a low mobility, doped channel to obtain a velocity differential between channels. Although an individual VMT is capable of faster switching than a HEMT of similar materials and equal lithographic feature sizes, the VMT circuit is limited to speeds which can be achieved by HEMT circuits in circuit applications where one transistor drives a similar transistor. Channel carrier population as a function of input gate voltage is calculated for HEMTs and VMTs using a 1 -D model.

However, the unabated scaling trend following Moore's law surface threats from process variation and reliability degradation. Nowadays, meeting the reliability requirements is more efforts demanding than ever before and needs: (a) understanding the transistor level degradations (b) developing realistic gate level degradation models (c) analyzing circuit degradations under different operating conditions and workloads, and (d) developing techniques to monitor and mitigate the degradations both at the design time and during the operation. In this dissertation, reliability degradation analysis together with the degradation monitoring and mitigation are presented. First, a classification of the reliability failures has been presented, while the scope of the dissertation is targeting Bias Temperature Instability (BTI); an intrinsic reliability failure mechanism that degrade transistors during their on states. Time, temperature and oxide field dependencies of BTI and its impact on transistor parameters such as threshold voltage, <b>carrier</b> mobility and <b>drain</b> current have been investigated analytically and simulated for several technology nodes. Second, the transistor level degradation has been translated into the gate level and a realistic BTI induced gate delay model has been established. At the gate level BTI simulation analysis, various types of gates and inputs have been used to demonstrate the design and input stimuli dependencies of BTI. Third, BTI mechanism has been addressed in both combinational and sequential logic circuits. Initially, BTI impact has been analyzed in several benchmark and synthetic circuits under different input stimuli. Thereafter, techniques have been developed to monitor BTI induced circuit delay degradation in both types of circuits.

40|$|Organic field-effect {{transistors}} (OFETs) {{are potential}} components for large-area electronics {{because of their}} attractive advantages: light weight, cost-effective and large-area processability, flexibility and resonable performance potential. However, the commercialization of OFETs faces several technical obstacles. Low mobility of organic semiconductors limits the current-carrying capacity; high operation voltage restricts their use in many applications; easy degradation in air and instability under electrical stress usually make the lifetime too short to be useful; and contact resistance and contact matching also limit the charge injection to the semiconductor. Many of the above problems relate to interfaces in OFETs. There are two important interfaces in OFETs. The interface between organic semiconductor and the dielectric layer is of crucial importance {{since it is the}} location where charge transport in the channel occurs. The other important interface in OFETs is between the semiconductor and the contacts, where the charge injection and removal happen during device operation. Surface treatment of the contacts for bottom-contact devices is usually necessary to achieve both a good semiconductor microstructure and excellent contact performance. Great effort has been applied to improving device performance, primarily by focusing on enhancing device mobility to increase current capacity and improving subthreshold behavior to reduce the operation voltage. One approach to improving both figures of merit is to use a high-capacitance gate dielectric, which reduces the operating voltage and increases the mobile charge carrier density for a given gate voltage. Operating at a higher channel charge density improves the effective mobility in OFETs. I first demonstrate the use of nanoscale high-$kappa$ materials based on barium titanate (BT) which are normally ferroelectric as gate dielectrics where their high dielectric constant is desirable but ferroelectric hysteresis is not. Self-assembled monolayer (SAM) treatment of the dielectric has been used to improve the morphology of subsequent deposition of organic semiconductor. The dipoles within the SAM, however, dramatically change the electrical performance in terms of threshold voltage and mobility. This thesis reviews the SAM treatment and explains why there is a substantial change in threshold voltage. During the fabrication, reactive agents can also reside at the interface between the semiconductor and the dielectric layer. Their chemical and structural effects are minor but their effect on electrical performance can be significant. This problem is studied using spectral photocurrent and $ 1 /f$ noise measurement by comparing OFETs whose polymer gate dielectric is exposed to UV ozone prior to semiconductor deposition with control OFETs whose semiconductor/dielectric interface is produced in a nearly oxygen-free environment. Both of the techniques have shown that the interfacial trapping sites created by oxygen treatment {{play an important role in}} electrical performance. One approach developed to improve the performance of bottom contact source/drain electrodes is to treat the contacts with thiols before deposition of the semiconductor. Especially suggestive evidence shows that thiols that increase the effective work function of the contacts (textsl{e. g. } fluorinatedthiols) yield better device performance than work function decreasing thiols (textsl{e. g. } alkane thiols). We compare two technologically relevant thiol treatments, an alkane thiol (1 -hexadecanethiol), and a fluorinated thiol (pentafluorobenzenethiol), in pentacene organic field effect transistors. Using textit{in-situ} semiconductor deposition, X-ray photoemission, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we were able to directly observe the interaction between the semiconductor and the thiol-treated gold layers. Our spectroscopic analysis suggests that there is not a site-specific chemical reaction between the pentacene and the thiol molecules. A homogeneous standing-up pentacene orientation was observed in both treated substrates, consistent with the morphological improvement expected from thiol treatment in both samples. Our study shows that both the HOMO-Fermi level offset and C $ 1 s$ binding energy are shifted in the two thiol systems, which can be explained by varied dipole direction within the two thiols, causing a change in surface potential. The additional improvement of the electrical performance in the pentafluorobenzenethiol case is originated by a reduced hole injection barrier that is also associated with an increase of the density of states in the LUMO. In OFETs, the accumulated charges are not evenly distributed along the channel especially when the OFETs are operated in the saturation region, where the drain side has much fewer accumulated charges than the source side due to the cancellation of effective gate voltage by the drain voltage. Thus the carriers should be less mobile on the drain side where the trap states are filled less adequately, and one should expect a varied mobility across the channel. For the same reason, the saturation current formula $I_{DS} = frac{W}{ 2 L}mu C_{i}(V_{GS}-V_{th}) ^{ 2 }$ for silicon MOSFETs is not suitable for OFETs, and the mobility calculation based on linear fitting of $sqrt{I_{DS}}$ to $V_{GS}$ is problematic. In the last part of this thesis, I have reviewed the curve fitting method and quasi-static capacitance-voltage (QSCV) method for deriving linear mobility in OFETs. Further, we have measured spatially resolved photocurrent in OFETs operated in the linear and saturation regions. Because the photogenerated charge is constant as a function of bias, spatially resolved photocurrent measurement locally measures the product of channel field and mobility. This product can be used to derive the local mobility across the channel. Our results directly show that in the saturation region, mobility decreases from source contact to drain contact due to the decreased density of <b>carriers</b> on the <b>drain</b> side...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{compelling}} need to explore different material options as well as device structures to facilitate smooth transistor scaling for higher speed, higher density and lower power. The enormous potential of nanoelectronics, and nanotechnology in general, offers us the possibility of designing devices with added functionality. However, at the same time, the new materials come with their own challenges {{that need to be}} overcome. In this work, we have addressed some of these challenges in the context of quasi- 2 D Silicon, III-V semiconductor and graphene. Bulk Si is the most widely used semiconductor with an indirect bandgap of about 1. 1 eV. However, when Si is thinned down to sub- 10 nm regime, the quasi- 2 D nature of the system changes the electronic properties of the material significantly due to the strong geometrical confinement. Using a tight-binding study, we show that in addition to the increase in bandgap due to quantization, it is possible to transform the original in direct bandgap to a direct one. The effective masses at different valleys are also shown to vary uniquely in an anisotropic way. This ultra-thin Si, when used as a channel in a double gate MOSFET structure, creates so called “volume in version” which is extensively investigated in this work. It has been found that the both the quantum confinement as well as the gating effect {{play a significant role in}} determining the spatial distribution of the charge, which in turn has an important role in the characteristics of transistor. Compound III-V semiconductors, like Inx Ga 1 -xAs, provide low effective mass and low density of states. This, when coupled with strong confinement in a nanowire channel transistor, leads to the “Ultimate Quantum Capacitance Limit” (UQCL) regime of operation, where only the lowest subband is occupied. In this regime, the channel capacitance is much smaller than the oxide capacitance and hence dominates in the total gate capacitance. It is found that the gate capacitance change qualitatively in the UQCL regime, allowing multi-peak, non-monotonic capacitance-voltage characteristics. It is also shown that in an ideal condition, UQCL provides improved current saturation, on-off ratio and energy-delay product, but a degraded intrinsic gate delay. UQCL shows better immunity towards series resistance effect due to increased channel resistance, but is more prone to interfacial traps. A careful design can provide a better on-off ratio at a given gate delay in UQCL compared to conventional MOSFET scenario. To achieve the full advantages of both FinFET and HEMT in III-V domain, a hybrid structure, called “HFinFET” is proposed which provides excellent on performance like HEMT with good gate control like FinFET. During on state, the carriers in the channel are provided using a delta-doped layer(like HEMT) from the top of a fin-like non-planar channel, and during off state, the gates along the side of the fin(like FinFET) help to pull-off the carriers from the channel. Using an effective mass based coupled Poisson-Schrodinger simulation, the proposed structure is found to outperform the state of the art planar and non-planar MOSFETs. By careful optimization of the gate to source-drain underlap, it is shown that the design window of the device can be increased to meet ITRS projections at similar gate length. In addition, the performance degradation of HFinFET in presence of interface traps has been found to be significantly mitigated by tuning the underlap parameter. Graphene is a popular 2 D hexagonal carbon crystal with extraordinary electronic, mechani-cal and chemical properties. However, the zero band gap of grapheme has limited its application in digital electronics. One could create a bandgap in grapheme by making quasi- 1 D strips, called nanoribbon. However, the bandgap of these nanoribbons depends on the the type of the edge, depending on which, one can obtain either semiconducting or metallic nanoribbon. It has been shown that by the application of an external transverse ﬁeld along the sides of a nanoribbon, one could not only modulate the magnitude of the bandgap, but also change it from direct to indirect. This could open up interesting possibilities for novel electronic and optoelectronic applications. The asymmetric potential distribution inside the nanoribbon is found to result in such direct to indirect bandgap transition. The corresponding carrier masses are also found to be modulated by the external ﬁeld, following a transition from a“slow”electron to a“fast” electron and vice-versa. Experimentally, it is difficult to control the bandgap in nanoribbons as precise edge control at nanometer scale is nontrivial. One could also open a bandgap in a bilayer graphene, by the application of vertical electric field, which has raised a lot of interest for digital applications. Using a self-consistent tight binding theory, it is found that, inspite of this bandgap opening, the intrinsic bias dependent electronic structure and the screening effect limit the subthreshold slope of a metal source drain bilayer grapheme transistor at a relatively higher value-much above the Boltzmann limit. This in turn reduces the on-off ratio of the transistor significantly. To overcome this poor on-off ratio problem, a semiconductor source-drain structure has been proposed, where the minority carrier injection from the drain is largely switched off due to the bandgap of the drain. Using a self-consistent Non-Equilibrium Green’s Function(NEGF) approach, the proposed device is found to be extremely promising providing unipolar grapheme devices with large on-oﬀ ratio, improved subthreshold slope and better current saturation. At high drain bias, the transport properties of grapheme is extremely intriguing with a number of nontrivial effects. Optical phonons in monolayer grapheme couple with carriers in a much stronger way as compared to a bilayer due to selection rules. However, it is difficult to experimentally probe this through transport measurements in substrate supported grapheme as the surface polar phonons with typical low activation energy dominates the total scattering. However, at large <b>drain</b> field, the <b>carriers</b> obtain sufficient energy to interact with the optical phonons, and create so called ‘hot phonons’ which we have experimentally found to result in a negative differential conductance(NDC). The magnitude of this NDC is found to be much stronger in monolayer than in bilayer, which agrees with theoretical calculations. This NDC has also been shown to be compensated by extra minority <b>carrier</b> injection from <b>drain</b> at large bias resulting in an excellent current saturation through a fundamentally different mechanism as compared to velocity saturation. A transport model has been proposed based on the theory, and the experimental observations are found to be in agreement with the model...|$|R
