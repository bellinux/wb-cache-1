Leaves of <b>common</b> <b>sassafras</b> are more aromatic, usually less {{coarsely}} toothed and the mid rib is sunken on the upper surface. <b>Common</b> <b>Sassafras</b> leaves thicker and heavier to touch.|$|E

50|$|Leaves {{similar to}} the related <b>common</b> <b>sassafras</b> (Doryphora sassafras). There are one or two teeth per {{centimetre}} on the Illawarra socketwood. The mid rib is raised above and below on the Illawarra socketwood. Lateral veins of the <b>common</b> <b>sassafras</b> are at a less acute angle than the Illawarra socketwood. Illawarra socketwood lateral veins are sharply angled at around 40 degrees {{in relation to the}} mid rib of the leaf.|$|E

50|$|Sassafras trees {{grow from}} 9 - 35 m tall with many slender {{sympodial}} branches, and smooth, orange-brown bark or yellow bark. All {{parts of the}} plants are fragrant. The species are unusual in having three distinct leaf patterns on the same plant: unlobed oval, bilobed (mitten-shaped), and trilobed (three-pronged); the leaves are hardly ever five-lobed. Three-lobed leaves are more <b>common</b> in <b>Sassafras</b> tzumu and Sassafras randaiense than in their North American counterparts, although three-lobed leaves do sometimes occur on Sassafras albidum. The young leaves and twigs are quite mucilaginous, and produce a citrus-like scent when crushed. The tiny, yellow flowers are generally six-petaled; Sassafras albidum and Sassafras hesperia are dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate trees, while Sassafras tzumu and Sassafras randaiense have male and female flowers occurring on the same trees. The fruit is a drupe, blue-black when ripe.|$|R
