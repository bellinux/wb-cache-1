The driving force for the 2 D- 3 D transition can be minimized by slowing the relaxation of misfit strain. As a result  the relatively smooth layer is deposited at lower temperature for the optimal growth rate. The quality of the InGaAs- and AlAs-strained layers deposited on InP substrate have been examined by the XRD, AFM and SIMS methods. Atomic force microscopy allows to observe 3 D growth mode even for very thin layers. Relatively strong relaxation effects are recognized by surface roughness. Two-dimensional di!raction measurement is a much more sensitive tool for the estimation of relaxation degree. The observations results were applied in the heterostructure barrier varactor (HBV) diode. In order to minimize the <b>conduction</b> <b>current</b> through HBV two materials with different design of the barriers were studied: one heterostructure with three homogeneous lattice matched barriers consisting of 20 nm Al 0. 48 In 0. 52 As and another one with strained step-like barriers consisting of 5 nm Al 0. 48 In 0. 52 As, 3 nm AlAs and 5 nm Al 0. 48 In 0. 52 As.

40|$|A two-fluid {{model of}} {{dielectric}} barrier gas discharge {{is presented in}} this thesis. The model predicts the physical structure of the gas discharge obtained between two electrodes, when one {{is covered with a}} dielectric material: It predicts the distribution of the electron and ion particle densities, electron energy, and electric field strength. It is a self-consistent numerical model, in which the dielectric properties of the dielectric material are included and the geometry of the electrodes is taken into account, thus coupling the charged-particle transport to the electric field. New boundary conditions are developed for the electron gas at the anode; the results indicate that the common boundary conditions frequently used in the literature give solutions with non-physical behavior. The new boundary conditions give solutions with the expected physical behavior. The equations of the model are formulated numerically using a Galerkin finite element method and solved using the Newton iteration method. New universal matrices for the finite element method are presented which can be used to construct complex finite element matrices, by replacing integrals with matrix products, in a consistent and uniform manner independent of element shape, dimensionality, and order. Solutions for DC, pulse-waveform and time-harmonic applied electrode voltages for geometries with and without a dielectric barrier are presented. The regulating effect of the dielectric barrier by surface charge accumulation is shown for discharge under constant applied voltage, assuming a static temperature for the electron gas, for the full self-consistent model. Also, simulations of dielectric barrier discharge with applied pulse-waveform voltages are compared with simulations of applied time-harmonic voltages. The results show very similar period-averaged electric fields, electron temperature profiles, charged particle <b>densities,</b> and total <b>conduction</b> <b>current</b> <b>densities.</b> However, a much higher period-integrated ionization rate is obtained from voltage pulse simulations, compared to time-harmonic voltage simulations.

No current switching is observed in ferromagnetic metallic, La 0. 67 Ca 0. 33 MnO 3 +delta (LCMO) specimens. The nonlinearity observed in LMMO cannot be explained {{on the basis of}} antiferromagnetic/paramagnetic insulating phases co-existing with ferromagnetic metallic phases below T-c, because such giant clusters are observed in LCMO. Substitution of Mg increases the Mn 4 + concentration, however, does not induce a transition to metallic state below T-c even at high hole concentration; instead, displays the behaviour of localisation. Localisation of carriers is due to the increased hole hopping distance (Mn 3 +-O-Mg 2 +-O-Mn 4 +) and by the spin canting. Below T-c, in the canted ferromagnetic state, the carriers can be delocalised by applying an electric field. The electric field enhances the mobility of the carriers and increases the hopping probability.
