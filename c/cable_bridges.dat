After hemp rope, iron chains began to become more common. However, fracture was quick, at around half a millisecond. In 1829 Wilhelm Albert had studied and reported on the failure of the iron chains and began creating a twisted metal cabling known as Albert Rope. In 1864 Andrew Smith Hallidie manufactured wire rope and was heavily involved in building early <b>cable</b> <b>bridges</b> and ropeway conveyors; his wire rope went on to be used in San Francisco's famous cable cars, and was also added to the cable drums in the hoist houses on the Comstock Lode.

40|$|Understanding thermal {{effects on}} the {{vibration}} of local (cable-dominant) modes in multi-cable structures is a complicated task. The main difficulty lies in the modification by temperature change of cable tensions, which are then undetermined. This paper applies a finite element procedure to investigate the effects of thermal loads on the linear dynamics of prestressed self-weighted multi-cable structures. Provided that boundary conditions are carefully handled, the discretization of cables with nonlinear curved beam elements can properly represent the thermoelastic behavior of cables {{as well as their}} linearized dynamics. A three-step procedure that aims to replace applied pretension forces with displacement continuity conditions is used. Despite an increase in the computational cost related to beam rotational degrees of freedom, such an approach has several advantages. Nonlinear beam finite elements are usually available in commercial codes. The overall method follows a thermoelastic geometrically non-linear analysis and hereby includes the main sources of non-linearities in multi-cable structures. The effects of cable bending stiffness, which can be significant, are also naturally accounted for. The accuracy of the numerical approach is assessed thanks to an analytical model for the vibration of a single inclined cable under temperature change. Then, the effects of thermal loads are investigated for two <b>cable</b> <b>bridges,</b> highlighting how natural frequencies can be affected by temperature. Although counterintuitive, a reverse relative change of natural frequency may occur for certain local modes. This phenomenon can be explained by two distinct mechanisms, one related to the physics intrinsic to cables and the other related to the thermal deflection of the superstructure. Numerical results show that cables cannot be isolated {{from the rest of the}} structure and the importance of modeling the whole structure for a quantitative analysis of temperature {{effects on the}} dynamics of <b>cable</b> <b>bridges...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on a co-rational (CR) framework, a 2 -noded element {{formulation}} of 3 D truss was presented, {{which was used}} for accurately modeling of suspension bridges with large displacements and rotations. The CR framework could consider the out-plane stiffness by the geometric stiffness, which was applicable {{to the analysis of}} 3 D <b>cable</b> <b>bridges.</b> Using the co-rational truss united with the energy convergence criteria and the Newton with Line Search Algorithm, the nonlinear behavior of 3 D cable structural system was simulated conveniently and accurately. Therefore, the traditional truss elements based on elastic modulus modified method and complex catenary elements were avoided. In order to simulate the hanging of girder and the structural system changing during the construction, the elements ’ killing and activating methods were realized by the modulus modified methods...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) is an {{advanced}} composite material with {{the advantages of}} high strength, lightweight, no corrosion and excellent fatigue resistance. Therefore, unidirectional CFRP has great potential for cables and to replace steel cables in cable structures. However, CFRP is a typical orthotropic material and its strength and modulus perpendicular to the fiber direction are much lower {{than those in the}} fiber direction, which brings a challenge for anchoring CFRP cables. This paper presents an overview of application of CFRP cables in cable structures, including historical review, state of the art and prospects for the future. After introducing properties of carbon fibers, mechanical characteristics and structural forms of CFRP cables, existing CFRP cable structures in the world (all of them are <b>cable</b> <b>bridges)</b> are reviewed. Especially, their CFRP cable anchorages are presented in detail. New applications for CFRP cables, i. e., cable roofs and cable facades, are also presented, including the introduction of a prototype CFRP cable roof and the conceptual design of a novel structure—CFRP Continuous Band Winding System. In addition, other challenges that impede widespread application of CFRP cable structures are briefly introduced...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Rain- Wind Induced Vibrations of a {{cable is}} a {{concomitant}} issue in cable- stayed bridges {{which it will}} threats the durability and safety of the structures. A deep understanding the phenomenal of the Fundamental physics was important to understand for improving the effective remedies to resolve. This Concept was firstly observed several decades ago. It found the attention of investigators when Shiraishi and Hikami observed that, {{at the time of}} construction of the Meikonishi Bridge in Japan, under the excitation from the wind during rain, these stay cables often exhibited large-amplitude vibrations. Rain – Wind induced vibrations was identify by an oscillation frequency and also the large amplitude that is much lower than the comparable Strouhal frequency for a classical Karman – vortex induced vibrations, which it have been regularly observed on many cable- stayed bridges and stated as Rain – Wind- Induced vibrations. By the last three decades, Rain- Wind induced vibrations of Stay <b>cable</b> <b>bridges</b> have been subjected to extensive study for two reasons. Firstly this type of vibrations occurred at large amplitude and potentially threatens the serviceability and safety of cable-stayed bridges. There have been records in the literature of both cable failure and damage to the Cable Deck connection because of Rain – Wind induced vibrations. Als...|$|E

40|$|Structural health {{monitoring}} {{is becoming a}} hot research direction in civil engineering. Considering the importance of long cable steel bridges in local transportation and field economic development, strong {{attention has been paid}} to structural health analysis to monitor the integrity, durability and reliability of the bridges. Long cable steel bridges are vulnerable to fatigue damage. Local test method, adopted in a number of fatigue damage analysis for short and/or medium bridge, could not be used for long cable bridge fatigue analysis as long <b>cable</b> <b>bridges</b> have many structural properties making inspection, instrumentation and testing of them very difficult. Finite Element Method (FEM), recommended as a rigorous method for fatigue damage analysis by British Standard, is proposed in this paper to analyze fatigue damage for a practical long cable steel bridge under traffic loadings. To this end, an effective Finite Element (FE) model of the Tsing Ma Bridge (TMB) in Hong Kong, embodying the properties of almost all the structural members is developed. Verification of the efficiencies of the model for bridge modal analysis and bridge dynamic response modeling are presented. The computed results are compared with, and found to match closely, online measured data. It shows the constructed bridge finite element model is efficient for structural health analysis...|$|E

40|$|For <b>cable</b> <b>bridges,</b> {{the cable}} tension force plays {{a crucial role}} in their construction, {{assessment}} and long-term structural health monitoring. Cable tension forces vary in real time with the change of the moving vehicle loads and environmental effects, and this continual variation in tension force may cause fatigue damage of a cable. Traditional vibration-based cable tension force estimation methods can only obtain the time-averaged cable tension force and not the instantaneous force. This paper proposes a new approach to identify the time-varying cable tension forces of bridges based on an adaptive sparse time-frequency analysis method. This is a recently developed method to estimate the instantaneous frequency by looking for the sparsest time-frequency representation of the signal within the largest possible time-frequency dictionary (i. e. set of expansion functions). In the proposed approach, first, the time-varying modal frequencies are identified from acceleration measurements on the cable, then, the time-varying cable tension is obtained from the relation between this force and the identified frequencies. By considering the integer ratios of the different modal frequencies to the fundamental frequency of the cable, the proposed algorithm is further improved to increase its robustness to measurement noise. A cable experiment is implemented to illustrate the validity of the proposed method. For comparison, the Hilbert–Huang transform is also employed to identify the time-varying frequencies, which are then used to calculate the time-varying cable-tension force. The results show that the adaptive sparse time-frequency analysis method produces more accurate estimates of the time-varying cable tension forces than the Hilbert–Huang transform method...|$|E
