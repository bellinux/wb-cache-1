5|$|The {{majority}} of all passengers travelling by air {{to or from}} the UK are carried by UK airlines, {{of which there are}} around forty, {{and at the end of}} 2006 the UK air transport fleet numbered 963 aircraft, flying just under 1.2million flights and averaging over eight hours of flying daily. Together the two largest airlines as measured by passenger numbers; British Airways and easyJet, account for nearly half of the 127million passengers flown on UK airlines. In terms of capacity, both available and used, British Airways is again the largest airline, whilst easyJet is pushed into third place by Virgin Atlantic Airways. British Airways passenger flights also account for over 50 per cent of all <b>cargo</b> <b>carried</b> by UK airlines, and when combined with its cargo operations the airline carries over 60 per cent of all <b>cargo</b> <b>carried</b> by UK airlines.|$|E
5|$|The combi model, the 747-200M, {{could carry}} freight {{in the rear}} section of the main deck via a side cargo door. A {{removable}} partition on the main deck separated the cargo area at the rear from the passengers at the front. The -200M could carry up to 238 passengers in a three-class configuration with <b>cargo</b> <b>carried</b> on the main deck. The model was {{also known as the}} 747-200 Combi. As on the -100, a stretched upper deck (SUD) modification was later offered. A total of 10 converted 747-200s were operated by KLM. Union des Transports Aériens (UTA) also had two aircraft converted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} season, Kommandøren served the tourist trade in Sogn, while she sailed the regular passenger/cargo routes {{during the winter}} months. Kommandøren was {{generally}} used as an express route ship, often carrying patients {{on their way to}} treatment. Amongst the <b>cargo</b> <b>carried</b> by was often live animals, including horses, cattle and sheep. During one of her trips, Kommandøren ran aground on 20 October 1900 near Tjugum in Balestrand. The ship was also at times employed to transport important dignitaries in the region, like she did in September 1920, when she brought politicians to Vik to inspect the area for a proposed railway project. Shortly after delivery, in September 1892, Kommandøren provided transport support to a large-scale Norwegian Army field exercise in Western Norway. She was tasked with transporting troops from Gudvangen to Lærdalsøyri after the completion of the exercises.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPrediction of <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> {{capacity}} {{provides a}} base for planning railway networks, decision-making about the operations of railway freight companies, and development of transport scheme. The application of system dynamics assists in the predication of railway <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity. Through {{the analysis of the}} key factors that influence <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity in the railway freight system, the boundary for railway <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity system is determined; the system cause-effect relationship containing six feedback loops is determined; the system flow and simulation formula is constructed; the model for the development of system dynamics-based railway <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity is constructed. With the statistical data about railway freight in China from 1900 to 2009, simulation tests are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the application of system dynamics model in the prediction of railway freight. The railway <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity is predicted from the time from 2011 to 2015. In 2015, it is predicted to reach 5. 40486 billion tons. The error analyses indicate that the maximum error of system prediction is 2. 66 %...|$|R

5|$|The main <b>cargo</b> <b>carried</b> was coal. In 1788, a {{group of}} {{shareholders}} set up a coal committee, and began trading. At first, the product came from the Staffordshire coalfields, travelling via the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, or from the Shropshire coalfields, but this was later supplemented by coal from the south Gloucestershire mines and then the Forest of Dean. This profitable business continued until 1833. Boats that worked the canal included Severn Trows, a type of sailing boat which was fitted with ketch, cutter or sloop rigging. Many were later converted for use as dumb barges by removing the masts, but none {{are known to have}} survived to the present day.|$|E

The NSR greatly developed as a heavily subsidized domestic route, with traffic peaking in 1987 with 6.58 million tons of <b>cargo</b> <b>carried</b> by 331 ships over 1306 voyages. With the end of the Soviet Union and its subsidies, the NSR traffic collapsed to 1.5–2 M tons of cargo.|$|E
25|$|ATC {{operations}} {{accounted for}} 685,304 gross tons of <b>cargo</b> <b>carried</b> eastbound during hostilities, including 392,362 tons {{of gasoline and}} oil, with nearly 60% of that total delivered in 1945.

25|$|British Dakota and Hastings {{aircraft}} carrying essential {{goods and}} raw materials began using Tegel {{on a regular basis}} from 17 November 1948. Regular cargo flights with American C-54s followed from 14 December 1948. Generally, the former carried food and fuel while the latter were loaded with coal. December 1948 also saw three Armée de l'Air Junkers Ju 52/3m transport planes participating in the airlift for the first time. However, the Armée de l'Air contributed to the overall airlift effort in a very small and symbolic way only. As a result of committing the small French transport fleet to the growing war effort in Indochina, as well as the joint Anglo-American decision to employ only four-engined planes {{for the remainder of the}} airlift to increase the number of flights and the amount of <b>cargo</b> <b>carried</b> on each flight by taking advantage of those aircraft's higher speeds and greater capacities, the French participation ceased.|$|E

500|$|The canal {{opened in}} 1805 {{and was used}} for {{passenger}} traffic as well as coal. In 1814 the Benedictine monks who came to Downside Abbey {{are said to have}} used the canal for the last stage of their journey. Another <b>cargo</b> <b>carried</b> by the canal was limestone from Combe Down. The peak level of <b>cargo</b> <b>carried</b> was in 1838 at 138,403tons resulting in over £17,000 of tolls being paid. Cargoes of over 100,000tons were common until the 1870s when the decline in output of coal from the various Somerset coalpits, along with competition from the railways, dramatically reduced the canal's profitability. [...] When the main pump at Dunkerton failed it was not replaced and there was not sufficient water for continual operation of the locks. [...] The canal went into liquidation in 1894; it closed in 1898 and was finally abandoned in 1904 when it was sold to the Great Western Railway for £2,000, and used as a branch of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway. The closure caused problems across the Somerset coalfield especially to the pits along the Paulton branch, which had relied on the canal for transportation.|$|E

500|$|When Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater {{built the}} Bridgewater Canal, {{the task of}} {{crossing}} the Irwell {{was one of the}} main obstacles he faced. The solution was to build a canal-carrying bridge across the river, the first barge aqueduct in England. The aqueduct, which opened in 1761, measured [...] high and [...] long, and became one of the wonders or the age. The Mersey and Irwell Navigation and the Bridgewater Canal competed for trade to and from Manchester for the next 120years and specially designed barges with a shallow draft, known as [...] "Mersey flats", were used on both waterways. [...] Over the years both trade and rivalry continued to grow with each company offering reduced freight charges or special rates and concessions to gain business from the other. The most important <b>cargo</b> <b>carried</b> was raw cotton from Liverpool to Manchester but timber, dyewoods, pig iron, lead, copper, nails, tar, sand, grain and flour were also carried. Passenger services had been operating on the Bridgewater Canal for some years and in 1807 the Irwell and Mersey Navigation Company began to compete with daily services between Runcorn and Manchester. In 1816 they began to use packet steamers. However, in 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened; packet boat services went into decline, and ceased to operate completely in the 1860s. [...] In Manchester two other canals used the Irwell as a point of access: the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal from 1809, and the Manchester and Salford Junction Canal from 1839. The previous year, the short Hulme Locks Branch Canal had also connected the Irwell to the Bridgewater Canal at Castlefield. All are now non-navigable, although the first is under restoration.|$|E
