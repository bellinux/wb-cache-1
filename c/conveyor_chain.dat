5000|$|The current {{company can}} be traced back to the Westinghouse Air Brake Company (WABCO) founded in 1869. WABCO {{pneumatics}} business was then taken over in 1989 by Rexroth, at the time a subsidiary of the Mannesmann Group. As a result, Mannesmann Rexroth Pneumatik GmbH was founded with its headquarters in Hanover, Germany. In 1991, Mannesmann Rexroth took over AB Mecman (founded in 1945), which was assigned to the pneumatics division and renamed Rexroth Mecman GmbH. After Bosch purchased Rexroth in 2001, Bosch Automation and Mannesmann Rexroth (parent of Rexroth Mecman) were merged to form today's Bosch Rexroth. The pneumatics division was divested in September 2013 as a standalone company under the name Rexroth Pneumatics and then sold to the financial investor Triton. Since then, the company has been trading under the name Aventics [...] At the beginning of 2016, the inverted tooth chain division was sold to Renold, a British drive and <b>conveyor</b> <b>chain</b> specialist.
