5|$|The small, pale {{northern}} subspecies of <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> {{found in}} the mountains of North Africa and the Arabian peninsula is now usually split as the pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin,</b> Ptyonoprogne obsoleta. The remaining birds are now identified as Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{areas of}} Pakistan where its range {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin,</b> the pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> breeds at a higher altitude. Its range does not overlap there with the Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin,</b> which is found high in the Himalayas, but where both occur in Iran, the pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> favours more arid habitats. In North Africa, the Eurasian species is again found at a higher level. The separation by altitude and aridity means that it is not known whether the closely related Ptyonoprogne martins could hybridise. If they were shown to do so, it would cast doubts on their specific distinctness.|$|E
5|$|The pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> is much drabber {{than most}} African swallows, and {{confusion}} is unlikely except with other crag martins or with sand martins {{of the genus}} Riparia. It is 15% smaller, paler and greyer than the Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin,</b> and has smaller tail spots. It is smaller, paler, and has a more contrasting throat than the rock martin. In the far east of its range, the pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> always has lighter underparts than the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin.</b> Although only slightly larger than the sand martin and brown-throated sand martin, the pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> is more robust, has white tail spots, and lacks a breast band. Separation of similar species in flight may be complicated by the difficulty of judging colours accurately in strong desert light, particularly with juveniles. The fast flight of the brown-throated sand martin also makes identification more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Some falcons {{have the}} speed and agility to catch {{swallows}} and martins in flight, and pale <b>crag</b> <b>martins</b> may be hunted by species such as the peregrine falcon, Taita falcon, African hobby and wintering Eurasian hobby. Pale <b>crag</b> <b>martins</b> often share their nesting sites with little swifts, which sometimes forcibly take over martins' nests.|$|R
50|$|This bird {{is closely}} related to the other three <b>crag</b> <b>martins</b> which share its genus, and has {{sometimes}} been considered to be the same species as one or both, although it appears that there are areas where two species' ranges overlap without hybridisation occurring. All three Ptyonoprogne <b>crag</b> <b>martins</b> are quite similar in behaviour to other Old World swallows that build mud nests, and are sometimes subsumed into the larger genus Hirundo, but this approach leads to inconsistencies in classifying other genera, particularly the house martins.|$|R
50|$|The genus Ptyonoprogne {{is closely}} related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo, but a DNA {{analysis}} showed that a coherent enlarged Hirundo genus should contain all the mud-builder genera. Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne <b>crag</b> <b>martins</b> resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow, the DNA research suggested that if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off.|$|R
5|$|These drab martins {{can only}} be {{confused}} with each other, or with sand martins of the genus Riparia. Even the smaller Ptyonoprogne species are slightly larger and more robust than the sand martin and brown-throated sand martin, and have the white tail spots which are absent from the Riparia martins. Where the ranges of Ptyonoprogne species overlap, the Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> is darker, browner and 15% larger than the rock martin, and larger and paler, particularly on its underparts, than the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin.</b> The white tail spots of the Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> are significantly larger than those of both its relatives. In the east of its range, the rock martin always has lighter, more contrasted underparts than the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The argasid tick Hyalomma marginatum {{was found}} in pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> nests on a {{sarcophagus}} and an ancient tomb in Egypt. This tick has been implicated in the transmission of Bahig virus, a pathogenic arbovirus previously thought to be transmitted only by mosquitoes. Another argasid tick, Argas africolumbae, {{was found in}} a nest of the closely related rock martins in Kenya. The nasal mite Ptilonyssus echinatus {{was found in a}} pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> in the Tibesti Mountains of northern Chad.|$|E
5|$|The crag martins {{are four}} species of small {{passerine}} {{birds in the}} genus Ptyonoprogne of the swallow family. They are the Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> (P.rupestris), the pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> (P.obsoleta), the rock martin (P.fuligula) and the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> (P.concolor). They {{are closely related to}} each other, and have formerly sometimes been considered to be one species. They are closely related to the Hirundo barn swallows and are placed in that genus by some authorities. These are small swallows with brown upperparts, paler underparts without a breast band, and a square tail with white patches. They can be distinguished from each other on size, the colour shade of the upperparts and underparts, and minor plumage details like throat colour. They resemble the sand martin, but are darker below, and lack a breast band.|$|E
5|$|It is salient to {{note that}} in {{taxonomy}} and binomial nomenclature, the genus name of the martins (the larger-bodied among swallow genera) is Progne, a Latinized form of Procne. Other related genera named after the myth include the <b>Crag</b> <b>Martins</b> Ptyonoprogne, and Saw-wings Psalidoprocne. Coincidentally, {{although most of the}} depictions of the nightingale and its song in art and literature are of female nightingales, the female of the species does not sing—it is the male of the species who sings its characteristic song.|$|R
5|$|The genus Ptyonoprogne {{is closely}} related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo into which it is often subsumed, but a DNA {{analysis}} showed that an enlarged Hirundo genus should contain all the mud-builder genera, including the Delichon house martins, a practice which few authorities follow. Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne <b>crag</b> <b>martins</b> resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow, the research showed that if Delichon, Cecropis and Petrochelidon are split from Hirundo, Ptyonoprogne should be also considered as a separate genus.|$|R
50|$|The {{rock martin}} feeds mainly on insects caught in flight, {{although}} it will occasionally {{feed on the}} ground. When breeding, birds often fly back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills and feed close to the nesting territory. At other times, they may hunt low over open ground. The insects caught depend on what is locally available, but may include mosquitoes and other flies, Hymenoptera, ants and beetles. This martin often feeds alone, but sizeable groups may gather at grass fires to feast on the fleeing insects, and outside the breeding season flocks of up to 300 may form where food is abundant. Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. <b>Crag</b> <b>martins</b> exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt, relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns.|$|R
5|$|The crag martins mainly breed on dry, {{warm and}} {{sheltered}} cliffs in mountainous areas with crags and gorges, and the Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> reaches 5,000m (16,500ft) in Central Asia. The use of buildings as artificial cliffs has enabled breeding expansion into lowland areas, {{particularly for the}} two tropical species, and the rock martin breeds in desert towns. In South Asia, migrant Eurasian birds sometimes join with flocks of the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> and roost communally on ledges of cliffs or buildings in winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies of the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> breeds {{in much of}} the Indian subcontinent {{from the}} base of the Himalayas south to the Nilgiri mountains and east to West Bengal, and P. c. sintaungensis is found in southwestern China, and the northern parts of Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. The dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> is largely resident apart from local movements after breeding, but it has bred in Malaysia at least once, and occurred as a vagrant to Sri Lanka and probably Borneo.|$|E
5|$|The pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> breeds in {{suitable}} habitats throughout northern Africa {{and through}} the Middle East as far as Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is largely resident apart from local movements or a descent to lower altitudes after breeding. In addition, there is some short-range movement, including martins from southern Arabia crossing the Red Sea and wintering alongside the local breeding birds in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa, and non-breeding P. f. spatzi and P. f. presaharica joining rock martins in Mali and Mauritania. In Pakistan, the breeding range of the subspecies P. f. peloplasta overlaps {{with that of the}} dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin,</b> although that species breeds at much lower levels, and in North Africa P. f. obsoleta occupies desert habitats whilst the Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> is found in the mountains. The pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> has been recorded as a vagrant in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and Sri Lanka, although its occurrence in the last country is treated as unproven in a 2011 field guide. The martin has been claimed to visit Turkey, but this is also disputed.|$|E
5|$|Martin pairs often nest alone, {{although}} where suitable {{sites are}} available small loose colonies may form. These {{are more common}} south of the Sahara, where up to 40 rock martin pairs together have been recorded. <b>Crag</b> <b>martins</b> aggressively defend their nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. The nest, built by both adults over several weeks, is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with soft dry grass or sometimes feathers. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl {{like that of the}} barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Usually two broods are raised, and the rock martin may nest for a third time in a season.|$|R
5|$|The nest, {{built by}} both adults over several weeks, {{is made from}} several hundred mud pellets and lined with {{feathers}} and soft, dry grass, hair, sheep’s wool or plant down. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl {{like that of the}} barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Caves are found in limestone formations and in the lava flows which cover much of western Saudi Arabia, and their ceilings are a favoured location for nesting pale <b>crag</b> <b>martins,</b> red-rumped swallows, and the little swifts which may appropriate the hirundines' nests. In buildings, nests are usually constructed against concrete, which provides adhesion similar to that of rock, but metal walls are sometimes used, and nests may be supported on beams or other horizontal supports. Birds sometimes breed in occupied buildings, and there is a record of a pair nesting in a busy restaurant kitchen. Artificial nests are readily used, and halved coconut shells have been successfully occupied in Abu Dhabi.|$|R
5000|$|These {{are members}} of the swallow family of birds, and are placed in the Hirundininae {{subfamily}} which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive river martins. DNA sequence studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae, broadly correlating with the type of nest built. [...] The groups are the [...] "core martins" [...] including burrowing species like the sand martin, the [...] "nest-adopters", which are birds like the tree swallow that utilise natural cavities, and the [...] "mud nest builders". Ptyonoprogne species construct a mud nest and therefore belong to the latter group; They resemble the Hirundo species in that they make open cup nests, whereas Delichon martins build closed cups, and the Cecropis and Petrochelidon swallows, have retort-like closed nests with an entrance tunnel. The genus Ptyonoprogne is closely related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo into which it is often subsumed, but a DNA analysis showed that a coherent enlarged Hirundo genus should contain all the mud-builder genera. Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne <b>crag</b> <b>martins</b> resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow, the DNA research showed that if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off.|$|R
5|$|The pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> has a {{very large}} range of 5.9millionkm2 (2.29millionsqmi). The total {{population}} is unknown, but the bird is described as very common in Jordan and common in Egypt. It has an expanding range and increasing population. Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> is {{not considered to be}} threatened, and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|These are {{exclusively}} Old World species. The {{rock martin}} breeds throughout Africa {{and through the}} Middle East as far as Afghanistan and Pakistan, and is replaced by the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> further east in India and Indochina. The Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> breeds from Iberia and northwesternmost Africa through southern Europe, the Persian Gulf and the Himalayas to southwestern and northeastern China. Northern populations of the Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> are migratory, with European birds wintering in north Africa, Senegal, Ethiopia and the Nile Valley, and Asian breeders going to southern China, the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East. Some European birds stay north of the Mediterranean, and, like populations in warmer areas such as India, Turkey and Cyprus, just move to lower ground after breeding. The dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> and rock are largely resident apart from local movements after breeding, when many birds descend to lower altitudes, although some pale northern rock martins from North African and southern Arabian may winter further south alongside the local subspecies in Ethiopia, Mali and Mauritania.|$|E
5|$|In Pakistan, the {{breeding}} {{range of the}} dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> overlaps that of the subspecies P. f. peloplasta of pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin,</b> but that species breeds much higher in the mountains. This altitudinal separation means {{that it is not}} known whether the two closely related martins could hybridise, which would cast doubts as to whether they were distinct species. Dusky crag martins from Burma and Thailand have been described as a separate darker subspecies, P. c. sintaungensis (originally Krimnochelidon concolor sintaungensis, Baker, 1832), {{but it is not clear}} that the difference is greater than that between individual martins of the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The clutch is {{two to five}} {{eggs that}} are white with brownish, ruddy or grey blotches {{particularly}} at the wide end. The egg size ranges from an average 20.2x14.0mm (0.80x0.55in) with a weight of 2.08g (0.073oz) for the Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> to 17.7x13.0mm (0.70x0.51in) with a weight of 1.57g (0.06oz) for the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin.</b> Both adults incubate the eggs for 13–19 days to hatching, and feed the chicks at least ten times an hour until they fledge 24–27 days later. The fledged young continue to be fed by the parents for some time after they can fly.|$|E
5|$|The pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> was {{formerly}} often treated as the small, pale northern subspecies {{of the rock}} martin, but it is now usually {{considered to be a}} separate species. The changes in size and colour are continuous, so the evidence for separate species is not strong, although some rock martins can weigh {{more than twice as much}} as the smallest subspecies of the pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin.</b> The average weight for P.o.fusciventris is 22.4g (0.79oz) against 10g (0.35oz) for P.o.obsoleta. There do not appear to be any intermediate forms where pale crag martins and rock martin populations breed close to each other in Somalia and Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|The total {{population}} of the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> has not been quantified, but it is suspected to be increasing owing to the availability of artificial nest sites. This martin is locally common in India, Thailand, and southern China, and {{there appear to be}} range extensions to the northeast into Guangxi, southwards into lowland Laos, and westwards to the hills and plains of Sindh. There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia. Its large range and presumed high numbers mean that the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> is not considered to be threatened, and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The genus Ptyonoprogne {{is closely}} related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo, and is {{sometimes}} included within it since the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resemble those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow. However, a DNA analysis showed that if Hirundo is enlarged to contain the crag martins, it should include all the mud-builder genera. Conversely, if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off. The pale crag martin's nearest relatives are {{the other members of the}} genus, the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> P. concolor of southern Asia, the rock martin P. fuligula of Southern Africa, and the Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> P. rupestris.|$|E
5|$|The pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> feeds {{mainly on}} insects caught in flight, {{although}} it will occasionally {{feed on the}} ground. Breeding birds often feed close to their nesting territory, flying back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills. Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt, relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns. When not breeding, they may also hunt low over open ground. The insects caught depend on what is locally available, but may include mosquitoes, flies, Hymenoptera, ants and beetles. This martin often feeds alone, but sizeable groups may gather at grass fires to feast on the fleeing insects, and outside the breeding season flocks of up to 300may form where food is abundant, such as agricultural areas, wetlands and sewage works. The pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> drinks in flight as it skims the water surface, although {{at least some of}} its water requirement is obtained from the insects it consumes. Wintering hirundines of other species are not normally found in the dry, rocky areas in which the pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> nests, so there is little competition for food.|$|E
5|$|This small martin's {{flight is}} {{typically}} slow and leisurely, {{but it is}} capable of considerable speed when required. The calls {{are similar to those of}} the Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> and include a soft chi, chi contact call and a twittering song.|$|E
5|$|The dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> feeds {{mainly on}} insects caught in flight. When nesting, birds often fly {{back and forth}} near to a rock face or {{building}} hunting for their prey. This martin is more gregarious outside the breeding season, and may form small flocks where food is abundant. Vertical surfaces are preferred for hunting, and {{a study of the}} Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin,</b> which has a similar foraging technique, showed that cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. The martin exploits the area close to the cliff when it hunts, relying on its high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns. When feeding young, foraging is concentrated on the profitable patches in the immediate vicinity of the nest, since there is a negative correlation between foraging distance and feeding rate.|$|E
5|$|The pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> {{is caught}} in flight by several fast, agile falcon species, such as hobbies, and it {{sometimes}} carries parasites, but it faces no major threats. Because of its range of nearly 6millionkm2 (2.3millionsqmi) and a large and apparently increasing population, it is not seen as vulnerable and is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The pale crag martin's {{flight is}} slow, with rapid wing beats {{interspersed}} with flat-winged glides, {{and it is}} more acrobatic than the larger Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin.</b> It is a quiet bird; the song is a muffled twitter, and other calls include a trrt resembling {{the call of the}} common house martin, a nasal vick, and a high pitched twee contact call.|$|E
5|$|Pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> pairs often nest alone, {{especially}} in the Sahara, although where suitable sites are available small loose colonies may form. This martin aggressively defends its nesting territory against conspecifics and other species. In Africa breeding dates vary geographically and with local weather conditions, but in northwest Africa February to April is normal, and in Asia nesting is from April to June. Two broods are common, and three have been raised in a season.|$|E
5|$|These are {{species of}} craggy mountainous habitats, {{although}} all three will also frequent human habitation. The African rock martin {{and the south}} Asian dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> are resident, but the Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> is a partial migrant; birds breeding in southern Europe are largely resident, but some northern breeders and most Asian birds are migratory, wintering in north Africa or India. They do not normally form large breeding colonies, but are more gregarious outside the breeding season. These martins build neat mud nests under cliff overhangs or in crevices in their mountain homes, and have readily adapted to the artificial cliffs provided by buildings and motorway bridges. Up to five eggs, white with dark blotches at the wider end, may be laid, and a second clutch is common. Ptyonoprogne martins feed mainly on insects caught in flight, and patrol cliffs near the breeding site with a slow hunting flight as they seek their prey. They may be hunted by falcons and infected with mites and fleas, but their large ranges and populations mean {{that none of the}} crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|All four {{species have}} {{extensive}} ranges and large populations, {{and the increasing}} use of artificial nest sites has enabled range expansion. The rock martin often breeds in lowland and desert towns, the Eurasian crag martin's range is expanding in Austria, Switzerland, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, and the dusky <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> is spreading northeastwards into Guangxi, south into lowland Laos, and westwards to the hills and plains of Sindh. There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia. Their large ranges and presumed high numbers mean that none of the crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> of the {{nominate}} subspecies P. o. obsoleta is 12–13cm (4.7–5.1in) {{long with}} light brown upperparts, becoming paler {{on the lower}} back, and a short square tail that has small white patches near the tips of all but the central and outermost pairs of feathers. It has a pale grey throat, upper breast and underwing coverts, {{and the rest of}} the underparts are a dirty white. The eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The wing length averages 1.3cm (4.55in) and the tail averages 4.8cm (1.9in). The sexes are similar in appearance, but juveniles have pale edges to the upperparts and flight feathers. The other subspecies differ from the nominate form as detailed in the table above.|$|E
5|$|These martins are 12–15cm (4.7–5.9in) {{long with}} drab brown or grey plumage {{and a short}} square tail that has small white patches near the tips of all but the central and {{outermost}} pairs of feathers. The eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The sexes are similar, but juveniles show pale edges to the upperparts and flight feathers. The species differ in plumage shades and size, Eurasian <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> being significantly larger than the others. The flight is slow, with rapid wing beats interspersed with flat-winged glides. The songs of these birds are simple twitterings, and contact calls include a high-pitched twee or chi, chi, and a tshir or trrt call {{like that of the}} house martin.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} locally common in Algeria, scarce in Morocco, and scarce in Pakistan. It has colonised {{southern}} Israel, where it breeds on houses, in the 1970s, and large numbers may occur outside the breeding season in Saudi Arabia and Oman. Population estimates include 10,000to 100,000pairs breeding in Egypt, 10,000pairs in the United Arab Emirates, and an Arabian winter population {{of up to}} 150,000birds in flocks that sometimes contain 300–500birds. A large breeding range expansion in the Arabian Peninsula has been aided {{by the use of}} high-rise buildings as nesting sites, and possibly a greater supply of insects from agricultural land. Breeding is now regular in Abu Dhabi, and Qatar's tall buildings may be the next site for colonisation. The pale <b>crag</b> <b>martin</b> first bred in Iraq in 2009.|$|E
