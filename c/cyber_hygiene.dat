50|$|<b>Cyber</b> <b>hygiene</b> is subjective. Although very poor, or very good, <b>cyber</b> <b>hygiene</b> is self-evident, what is {{considered}} acceptable <b>cyber</b> <b>hygiene</b> may vary from person to person.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyber</b> <b>hygiene</b> {{is linked}} to cyber {{security}} since poor <b>cyber</b> <b>hygiene</b> will adversely affect an organisation's cyber security and, conversely, strong (or weak) cyber security policies and procedures may improve (or lower) an individual's <b>cyber</b> <b>hygiene.</b>|$|E
50|$|A key {{aspect of}} <b>cyber</b> <b>hygiene</b> {{is that it}} relates to an individual, rather than a group or an organisation. <b>Cyber</b> <b>hygiene</b> is the {{responsibility}} of the individual, not the organisation (although corporate policies relating to cyber security may impinge on an individual's <b>cyber</b> <b>hygiene).</b> <b>Cyber</b> <b>hygiene</b> is distinct from cyber security. One (<b>cyber</b> <b>hygiene)</b> {{is the responsibility of}} an individual, and applies to all of their online activities, while the other (cyber security) is the responsibility of a group or organisation, and applies to their professional activities only.|$|E
50|$|A cyber {{resilient}} organisation is {{one that}} has robust cyber security policies and systems, and whose members have good <b>cyber</b> <b>hygiene.</b> The absence of either (low organisational cyber security or poor personal <b>cyber</b> <b>hygiene)</b> will adversely affect an organisation's cyber resilience.|$|E
50|$|A {{person with}} good <b>cyber</b> <b>hygiene</b> will select and {{maintain}} high quality passwords, install and maintain security software on the digital devices, keep their virus definitions up-to-date, run regular security scans on their digital devices, adhere to cyber security policies, protect their personal data, and avoid {{potential sources of}} infection. A person with low <b>cyber</b> <b>hygiene</b> may fail to observe {{one or more of}} these behaviours, such as not routinely updating their virus definitions or using online services that are known sources of malware.|$|E
50|$|Improving <b>cyber</b> <b>hygiene</b> {{requires}} {{training and}} education. It needs {{to begin with}} educating everyone {{about the risks of}} their online actions. This must start early during the people's formative years because most children get poor cyber habits early in their lives. Improving hygiene also requires better training for people to improve their ability to detect online fraud. Such training must focus on making people aware of online safety protocols, safe browsing practices, secure password creation and storage, and on procedures for sequestering and reporting suspicious activity. At its core developing better <b>cyber</b> <b>hygiene</b> requires us to replace poor cyber habits with smarter habits.|$|E
50|$|CSA {{has been}} driving {{outreach}} efforts to raise {{public awareness of}} the importance of cybersecurity. However, cybersecurity is a team sport; forging a secure cyberspace requires efforts not just from the Government, but collective action with businesses, individuals and the community. We all {{need to be aware of}} and adopt good <b>cyber</b> <b>hygiene</b> practices and businesses need to take cybersecurity into consideration and develop robust systems with defences against attacks.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cyber</b> <b>hygiene</b> is the {{establishment}} and maintenance of an individual's online safety. It is the online analogue of personal hygiene, and encapsulates the daily routines, occasional checks and general behaviours required to maintain a user's online [...] "health" [...] (security). This would typically include (but is not limited to) using a firewall, updating virus definitions, running security scans, selecting and maintaining passwords (and other entry systems), updating software, backing-up data and securing personal data.|$|E
