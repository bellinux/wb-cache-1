In this paper, we extend {{an existing}} HTN planner {{with a new}} state projection algorithm. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} HTN planner that can reason about nonlinear <b>continuous</b> <b>effects.</b> We use a wait action to instruct this planner to consider <b>continuous</b> <b>effects</b> in a given state. We also introduce a new planning domain to demonstrate the benefits of planning with nonlinear <b>continuous</b> <b>effects.</b> We compare our approach with a linear <b>continuous</b> <b>effects</b> planner and a discrete effects HTN planner on a benchmark domain, which reveals that its additional costs are largely mitigated by domain knowledge. Finally, we present an initial application of this algorithm in a practical domain, a Navy training simulation, illustrating the utility of this approach for planning in dynamic continuous environments. ...|$|R

50|$|This {{extension}} of PDDL2.1 from around 2002-2006 {{provides a more}} flexible model of continuous change {{through the use of}} autonomous processes and events.The key this extension provides is the ability to model the interaction between the agent's behaviour and changes that are initiated by the agent's environment. Processes run over time and have a <b>continuous</b> <b>effect</b> on numeric values. They are initiated and terminated either by the direct action of the agent or by events triggered in the environment. This 3-part structure {{is referred to as the}} start-process-stop model. Distinctions are made between logical and numeric states: transitions between logical states are assumed to be instantaneous whilst occupation of a given logical state can endure over time. Thus in PDDL+ continuous update expressions are restricted to occur only in process effects. Actions and events, which are instantaneous, are restricted to the expression of discrete change. This introduces the before mentioned 3-part modelling of periods of continuous change: (1) an action or event starts a period of continuous change on a numeric variable expressed by means of a process; (2) the process realizes the continuous change of the numeric variable; (3) an action or event finally stops the execution of the process and terminates its effect on the numeric variable. Comment: the goals of the plan might be achieved before an active process is stopped.|$|E

50|$|While the glycemic {{index of}} foods {{is used as}} a guide to the rise in blood glucose that should follow meals {{containing}} those foods, actual increases in blood glucose show considerable variability from person to person, even after consumption of identical meals. This is in part because glycemic index {{does not take into account}} other factors besides glycemic response, such as insulin response, which is measured by the insulin index and can be more appropriate in representing the effects from some food contents other than carbohydrates. In particular, since it is based on the area under the curve of the glucose response over time from ingesting a subject food, the shape of the curve has no bearing on the corresponding GI value. The glucose response can rise to a high level and fall quickly, or rise less high but remain there for a longer time, and have the same area under the curve. For subjects with type 1 diabetes who do not have an insulin response, the rate of appearance of glucose after ingestion represents the absorption of the food itself. This glycemic response has been modeled, where the model parameters for the food enable prediction of the <b>continuous</b> <b>effect</b> of the food over time on glucose values, and not merely the ultimate effect that the GI represents.|$|E
50|$|Kliefoth {{laid down}} his {{conception}} of the Church and church polity in his Acht Bücher von der Kirche (vol. i., Schwerin, 1854). The first four books treat {{of the kingdom of}} God founding of the Church, of the means of grace, of the congregation and its service, and of the Church and its order and government. The last four books, which were to treat of the development and completion of the Church never appeared. Kliefoth's peculiar conception was due chiefly to his occupation with the old Lutheran church orders. With great energy he emphasizes the divine foundation of the Church through the acts of salvation of the triune God; its divine basis in the Means of Grace, which mediate and vouchsafe the <b>continuous</b> <b>effect</b> of Christ and his spirit; the divine institution of the office of the means of grace; and the necessity of the organization and incorporation of the Church in church order and church government. The Church is for him the empirical congregation of the called, and not merely the congregation of true believers; and for him Lutheranism is not merely a doctrine or dogmatical tendency, but a distinctive church body whose peculiar historical development is to be perpetuated. He opposed the territorialism of state omnipotence, which denied the independence of the Church, the collegialism of modern representative church government, which originated in the Reformed Church and seemed to him to endanger the privilege and authority of the office of the means of grace; unionism, which threatened to absorb the Lutheran Church as such, or at least its confession; and the amalgamation of Church and politics, with its tendency toward the establishment of a national German Evangelical Church. On the other hand, he aimed at the restoration of the Lutheran state churches and the strengthening of Lutheranism through a closer union. In this sense he represented the government of the Mecklenburg church at the Eisenach Conference after 1852; and in 1868 he founded with others the Allgemeine evangelisch-lutherische Konferenz.|$|E
5000|$|Aristotle's {{philosophical}} works continue many of {{the same}} Socratic themes as his teacher Plato. Amongst the new proposals he made was a way of explaining causality, and nous {{is an important part of}} his explanation. As mentioned above, Plato criticized Anaxagoras' materialism, or understanding that the intellect of nature only set the cosmos in motion, but is no longer seen as the cause of physical events. Aristotle explained that the changes of things can be described in terms of four causes at the same time. Two of these four causes are similar to the materialist understanding: each thing has a material which causes it to be how it is, and some other thing which set in motion or initiated some process of change. But at the same time according to Aristotle each thing is also caused by the natural forms they are tending to become, and the natural ends or aims, which somehow exist in nature as causes, even in cases where human plans and aims are not involved. These latter two causes (the [...] "formal" [...] and [...] "final"), are concepts no longer used in modern science, and encompass the <b>continuous</b> <b>effect</b> of the intelligent ordering principle of nature itself. Aristotle's special description of causality is especially apparent in the natural development of living things. It leads to a method whereby Aristotle analyses causation and motion in terms of the potentialities and actualities of all things, whereby all matter possesses various possibilities or potentialities of form and end, and these possibilities become more fully real as their potential forms become actual or active reality (something they will do on their own, by nature, unless stopped because of other natural things happening). For example, a stone has in its nature the potentiality of falling to the earth and it will do so, and actualize this natural tendency, if nothing is in the way.|$|E

50|$|A second {{criticism}} {{concerns the}} significance of the lack of impact melt rocks older than about 4.1 Ga.

40|$|Fate {{modeling}} for {{characterization of}} ecotoxic substances in life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) is traditionally performed with steady-state multi-compartment models. Instantaneous mixing within compartments is an implicit {{assumption of the}} multi-compartment model. Others have shown that steady-state models can account for pulse-exposure if the ecotoxic effect is calculated with a constant effect factor. The potentially affected fraction of species (PAF) has previously been used to derive ecotoxic effect factors. Time and space variant dispersion models (transient models) are used in marine ecological risk assessments for aquatic exposure from intermittent marine discharges. Transient models can implement <b>continuous</b> <b>effect</b> functions in pulse-exposure assessment. In this paper the significance of assuming constant effect factors is quantified by calculation of characterization factors for marine aquatic ecotoxicity with a transient dispersion model. Multi-substance PAF (msPAF) is used as definition of ecotoxic effect. Results show that for characterization factors with msPAF assuming concentration addition only, the deviation between a constant effect factor and a <b>continuous</b> <b>effect</b> function is small. This implies that pulse-effects are well handled with the traditional approach of approximating effect with constant effect factors. For msPAF defined {{with a combination of}} response and concentration addition, the deviation can be several orders of magnitude. </p...|$|E
