During the 1980s, Schneider emerged as a leading public advocate of sharp reductions of greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming. In 2006 Professor Schneider was an Adelaide Thinker in Residence advising the South Australian Government of Premier Mike Rann on climate change and renewable energy policies. In ten years South Australia went from zero to 31% of its electricity generation coming from renewables.|$|E

5000|$|Khvostov {{used the}} {{following}} material for copying — The Nude Maja by Francisco Goya, Venus of Urbino by Tiziano, Sleeping Venus by Giorgione, Sistine Madonna by Raphael Sanzio, The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden by Masaccio, The Flight into Egypt by Rembrandt, The Rape of Europa by Claude Lorrain, Grove of Ship Timber by Ivan Shishkin, Poor Liza by Orest Kiprensky, Dmitry Levitsky’s portraits, Music by Henri Matisse and Black Square by Kazimir Malevich. This choice was also specifically emphasized by Ekaterina Andreeva, leading research associate of the State Russian Museum Department of the new wave, art critic and curator, characterizing Khvostov as an “absurdist primitivist painter of the hermitage museum culture”. She believes {{that it was an}} inheritance of traditions of the Leningrad necrorealism of the 80’s that brought along a harmonious cooperation of Khvostov and others from “the New Stupid” both art groups grew from the “New artists” movement. [...] No, it’s not difficult to find a model, but it’s easier to draw yourself. You yourself are the most disciplined and untiring sitter. Narrow bounds allow to focus on a single object, investigate his psychology Oleg Khvostov Portraits and self-portraits and lavender landscapes, borrowed from impressionists and postimpressionists, hold a special place among cross-cutting themes of Khvostov’s art works. Stanislav Savistsky (art critic, curator, lecturer of the Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences) in his “Absolute painting” exhibition review pinpointed some patterns of Khvostov’s portraiture. In his remakes of classical works and ultimate series of self-portraits the art expert traced a commonness of geometric forms, which led him to the conclusion that any of Khvostov’s portraits actually, to a varying degree, is a self-portrait - a way of searching for the artist’s self-identity. Among Khvostov’s portraits Pilikin emphasized his taste for illustrating political leaders, public men, people of religion and mass art as another <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>theme,</b> for the artist considers them to represent the spirit of his times.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGlobal {{migration}} {{is a topic}} of utmost importance in psychological research. As over 200 million people are on the move across national borders, and many more within their own countries, the processes of these migrations must be examined from {{different points of view}} and from different geographical locations. The articles in this special journal issue pointedly illustrate the role of international, national, community, and individual factors that shape these migrations. One <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>theme</b> is the importance of studying how multiple levels of context affect immigrant and migrant experiences. All six contributions, collectively, enrich the often individual-centric psychological literature. Issues of resilience and spaces of resistance emerged as a second <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>theme,</b> pointing to new directions for acculturation research and intervention. The challenge of recognizing diversity within migrant communities and among migration patterns is a third <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>theme</b> essential to address as we work toward a more equal world in which people can more freely chose whether to stay or leave their homes...|$|E

40|$|This {{collection}} {{represents a}} significant {{intervention in the}} space cohabited by witchcraft, spirit worlds, and development – a realm frequently marginalised by development practice. Through a diverse set of scholarly and methodological orientations, the contributions draw on contrasting case studies (spanning the local, national, and borderlands) to explore the current and possible future co-productions of development through various forms of spirituality. They do so with attention to the paradoxes, nuances, and complexities of these intersections. This introduction explores some of the <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>themes</b> arising from these complexities, including: scale; limitations of Euro-dominant conceptualisations of development; Othering of polytheistic, multi-theistic, and non-theistic spiritual ontologies; entanglements of spirituality, politics, and power; and co-productions of new forms of development. We argue that thinking through these various <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>themes</b> provides a multitude of possibilities for decolonising the development project...|$|R
