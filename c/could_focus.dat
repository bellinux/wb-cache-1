5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, it covered the {{entertainment}} industry, such as circuses, fairs, and burlesque shows. It also created a mail service for travelling entertainers. Billboard began focusing more on the music industry as the jukebox, phonograph, and radio became commonplace. Many topics it covered were spun-off into different magazines, including Amusement Business in 1961 to cover outdoor entertainment, so that it <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> on music. After Donaldson died in 1925, Billboard was passed down to his children and Hennegan's children, until it was sold to private investors in 1985, and has since been owned by various parties.|$|E

5|$|Mother 3 is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console in 2006. The {{music for the}} game was composed exclusively by Shogo Sakai, who he had previously composed music for games such as Super Smash Bros. Melee and Kirby Air Ride. Series developer Shigesato Itoi stated that Sakai was given the position because he understood Mother 3 the most, given {{that he could not}} use Keiichi Suzuki or Hirokazu Tanaka, the composers for the first two games, as they were both busy with other projects. Itoi also said that given the massive amount of songs in the game, over 250, he needed someone who {{had a lot of time}} to dedicate to the project and who <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> exclusively on it.|$|E
5|$|On May 13, 2013, reports {{surfaced}} that AT {{had only}} sold 15,000 {{units of the}} First since its launch, and was planning to discontinue the device {{in response to the}} poor reception of Facebook Home from both users and AT's sales representatives. The reports came shortly after AT had lowered the First's price from $99.99 to $0.99 on a two-year contract as a promotion; however, AT denied any possible connection to the device being possibly discontinued. In response to the issues, the release of the First on the British carriers EE and Orange was indefinitely delayed so Facebook <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> on making improvements to the Home software.|$|E

5|$|Ottman {{said the}} {{challenge}} on Valkyrie {{was to create}} tension from dialogue scenes, and he often reshaped scenes to do this: moments rather than whole scenes were cut from the film. Being historically accurate meant Ottman was more restricted in reorganizing scenes, but {{he was able to}} choose what lines and close-ups he <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> on. Ottman said the scene he was most saddened to delete was a scene where von Stauffenberg dances with his wife because he had been looking forward to scoring it.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 {{off-season}} {{began with}} a trade for Alex Tanguay, formerly of the Colorado Avalanche, and with Sutter relinquishing his head coaching position to assistant Jim Playfair so he <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> on his duties as general manager. Despite a marked improvement in team offence and a solid 96-point season, it was only good enough for eighth place in a Western Conference where seven teams cracked the 100-point barrier. In the playoffs, Calgary fell in six games to the top seeded Red Wings in the first round. During the series, the Flames were fined by the NHL for several stick-related penalties in the fifth game. Notably, backup goaltender Jamie McLennan was suspended five games for slashing Red Wings forward Johan Franzen. Franzen would score the series clinching goal in the Game 6 defeat in Double Overtime.|$|E
5|$|The large {{quantity}} of artefacts and records which the AWRS had gathered were also returned to Australia in 1919, though work on organising {{them into an}} archive was not completed until 1932. The Australian War Museum was formed in 1919 {{on the basis of}} the Section's collection, and Treloar joined the Museum at some stage during the year. Henry Gullett was appointed the War Museum's first director on 11August 1919 after Bean turned down the position so that he <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> on editing and writing the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918. Treloar was appointed the Museum's deputy director on the same date. Bean, Gullet and Treloar were subsequently the key figures in the establishment of the AWM.|$|E

5|$|What {{had seemed}} a simple {{military}} intervention of short duration {{led to a}} full-scale war in South America's southeast. The Progressive Cabinet named Paranhos plenipotentiary minister. His mission was to end the conflict with Uruguay so that Brazil <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> on the far more serious threat posed by Paraguay. He arrived in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, on 2 December 1864. Paranhos signed a peace treaty with the Uruguayan government on 20 February 1865, ending the war. Paranhos not only managed to bring about peace, but he concurrently forged an alliance between Brazil, Argentina and the Uruguayan rebels (who formed Uruguay's postwar government) against Paraguay. The pact would later be officially signed as the Treaty of the Triple Alliance.|$|E
5|$|While writing Prisoners of the Sun, Hergé {{decided that}} he wanted to move to Argentina, and focused his {{attention}} on completing all outstanding commissions so that he <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> on his emigration. He enlisted the aid of Van Melkebeke, Guy Dessicy, and Frans Jageneau to help finish Prisoners; they gathered at his home on the Avenue Delleur and produced many of the backgrounds within the story. He also employed his friend Bernard Heuvelmans to help devise the ending of the story; he paid Heuvelmans 43,000 Belgian francs for doing so.|$|E
5|$|As {{development}} continued, id Software hired {{their former}} Softdisk liaison Kevin Cloud {{as an assistant}} artist, and moved the company out to Mesquite, Texas, near where Apogee was located. Scott Miller of Apogee was pleased to have his star developers nearby, and agreed to not only increase their royalty rate to 50 percent, but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk, ScubaVenture, so that id <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> on Wolfenstein. The game {{was intended to be}} released using Apogee's shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free, with ten levels per episode. Upon finding out that the team was able to create a level in a single day, using {{a modified version of the}} Commander Keen 2D map editor, Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes, which could be sold in different-sized packs. Around the same time, the team changed members and structure: id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur, who had stayed in Shreveport, to be both their CEO and business team; Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects, while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office to get away from the noise.|$|E

5|$|As {{with every}} game prior to Final Fantasy VII, Square had {{continued}} to use the passion-based game development approach present with their early projects, but now had the resources and ambition to create the game they wanted. This was because they had extensive capital from their earlier commercial successes, which meant they <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> on quality and scale rather than obsessing over their budget. Final Fantasy VII eventually became ranked {{as one of the}} most expensive video game projects at the time, coming in at an estimated $40 million USD, which adjusted for inflation came to $61 million in 2017. Development of the final version lasted just over a year, and included a staff of between 100 and 150 people. As video game development teams were usually only 20 people, the game had what was described as the largest development team of any game up to that point. The development team was split between both Square's Japanese offices and its new American office in Los Angeles, with the American team primarily responsible for city backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|In January 1953 Raw, who was by now a {{squadron}} leader, was appointed {{the commanding officer}} of No. 2 Squadron. On 23 February he also became the initial commander of No. 1 Long Range Flight, which had been formed {{to participate in the}} 1953 London to Christchurch air race using two of the RAAF's new English Electric Canberra bombers. He handed this position to Wing Commander Derek Cuming in May, but remained a member of the flight. In July Raw temporarily vacated his position at No. 2 Squadron so he <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> on preparing for the air race. The Canberras piloted by Raw and Cuming departed Australia for the United Kingdom on 10 September, and the race began on 9 October. Raw's aircraft suffered damage to its nose wheel while landing to refuel at Woomera, but was able to be repaired. This accident cost Raw the lead in the race. He arrived at Christchurch at 04:32 on 10 October, finishing second behind a RAF Canberra piloted by Flight Lieutenant Roland (Monty) Burton.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{had been}} an Ottoman sanjakbey, who {{defected}} from the empire and united several Albanian princes under the League of Lezhë. From Krujë, his main fort, he {{led the league in}} the Ottoman-Albanian wars. Having defeated the Ottomans in many battles he allied with Western Christian states and leaders, especially with Alfonso V of Aragon and the Papal States. On 14 August 1464, Pope Pius II, one of Skanderbeg's major benefactors, died and his plans for a crusade against the Ottoman Empire disintegrated. The alliances and promises for help from the major Christian powers were canceled {{with the exception of the}} Kingdom of Hungary under Matthias Corvinus and the Republic of Venice. Sultan Mehmed II realized the power vacuum created after Pius died and he tried to take advantage of the situation. He thus attempted to sign a peace agreement with Hungary and Venice so that his forces <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> on Albania to gain a base for future campaigns in the Italian peninsula. His efforts were unsuccessful, however, since neither Venice nor Hungary accepted his proposed treaty. Mehmed thus kept his armies stationed in the Balkans, one force near Jajce in Bosnia, one in Ohrid, and another one in the Morea.|$|E

5|$|Some reports {{suggested}} that the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle program to replace the M113 family of vehicles was being favored over the GCV program. While procurement of the AMPV fleet would cost over $5 billion, the Government Accountability Office estimated the GCV fleet would cost $37 billion. In April 2013, the Congressional Budget Office said the AMPV {{would be a better}} buy because analysts had asserted that the vehicles the GCV was slated to replace should not be first. The GCV would replace 61 M2 Bradley IFVs per armored combat brigade, making up 18 percent of the 346 armored combat vehicles in each armored brigade. A 24 September 2013 Congressional Research Service report {{suggested that}} given budgetary constraints, the GCV program may be unrealistic, and that one potential discussion <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> on a decision by the Army to replace the GCV with the AMPV as their number one ground combat vehicle acquisition priority.|$|E
5|$|The war in Zululand {{effectively}} {{ended on}} 4 July 1879 with Chelmsford's decisive {{victory at the}} Zulu capital Ulundi. Around {{the same time the}} British appointed a new Governor and High Commissioner for the Transvaal and Natal, Sir Garnet Wolseley, who introduced a new Transvaal constitution giving the Boers a limited degree of self-government. Wolseley blunted the Zulu military threat by splitting the kingdom into 13 chiefdoms, and crushed Sekhukhune and the Bapedi during late 1879. He had little success in winning the Boers over to the idea of federation; his defeat of the Zulus and the Bapedi had the opposite effect, as with these two long-standing threats to security removed the Transvaalers <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> all their efforts against the British. Most Boers refused to co-operate with Wolseley's new order; Kruger declined a seat in the new executive council.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Takahashi {{talked with}} Hirohide Sugiura, who had {{likewise}} worked at Square and {{was beginning to}} feel frustrated {{due to a lack of}} creative freedom. After discussing the matter, the two decided to create their own company and pursue projects they wanted to create. When planning their new company, Takahashi and Sugiura decided that they needed a publisher with substantial market presence to help them rather than being an independent studio. Takahashi and Sugiura approached multiple companies for support, but most of the companies they contacted outright rejected their offer as they believed that Monolith Soft should be an independent company. However, Namco were interested in investing into Monolith Soft as a dedicated subsidiary, whilst handling logistics and marketing so that the core staff <b>could</b> <b>focus</b> on game development. An important supporter of Monolith Soft was Namco's founder Masaya Nakamura, who shared many of Takahashi and Sugiura's goals and ideals. Monolith Soft is noted as being one of a group of video game companies—alongside Sacnoth, Love-de-Lic and Mistwalker—founded by Square staff who had worked on notable titles produced during the 1990s. The company was officially founded on 1 October 1999 by Takahashi, Sugiura, and Yasuyuki Honne, who had worked at Square on both the Chrono series and with Takahashi on Xenogears. The company's offices were originally based in Yokohama.|$|E
