It was not until January 1919, when the world-famous pianist and composer Ignacy Paderewski became prime minister and foreign minister of a new government, that it was recognized in the West.|$|E
5|$|This Counter-Reformation {{offensive}} happened somewhat mysteriously in a country, {{where there}} were no religious wars and the state had not <b>cooperated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church in eradicating or limiting competing denominations. Among the factors responsible, low Protestant involvement among the masses, especially of peasantry, pro-Catholic position of the kings, low level of involvement of the nobility once the religious emancipation had been accomplished, internal divisions within the Protestant movement, and the rising intensity of the Catholic Church propaganda, have been listed.|$|E

40|$|Past {{qualitative}} {{research has shown}} that fear of retaliation influences an individual 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> police. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantitatively examine the influence that fear of retaliation has on a citizen 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> police. This study also examined both normative and instrumental motivations for <b>cooperating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> police to understand which motivations are more salient at explaining willingness to <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> police. Data for this study were collected from 408 Detroit homes in 2009 from three different neighborhoods where homes were selected randomly from those neighborhoods. Results indicate that the instrumental motivation, fear of retaliation, influences an individual 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> police. However, even more salient was the normative motivation, trust in the police, which showed that citizens who are more trustful of the police will be more willing to <b>cooperate</b> <b>with</b> them...|$|R

Cisneros and Garza were eventually {{sentenced to life in}} prison by a state court in 1994, but Cisneros' sentence was overturned due to a legal technicality. She was convicted again in 1998 by a federal court and {{sentenced to life in prison}}. Martínez was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty and testifying against the two in court. Though U.S. officials tried to have the two assassins extradited, the hitmen never faced trial in Texas. They were prosecuted in Mexico and given a 15-year sentence.|$|E

The increased efforts in the areas of taxation and maintenance of the military forces made possible the positive outcomes of some of the armed conflicts that took place during Sigismund's reign.|$|E
5|$|The European {{demand for}} {{agricultural}} products and industrial commodities stipulated maritime activity and international trade to an unprecedented extent. The Ayyubids {{played a leading role}} in this as they controlled sea-trade routes which passed through the ports of Yemen and Egypt via the Red Sea. The trade policy of the Ayyubids placed them in a position of great advantage; although they <b>cooperated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Genoans and Venetians in the Mediterranean Sea, they prevented them from having access to the Red Sea. Thus, they kept the trade of the Indian Ocean exclusively in their hands. In the Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids drew large benefits in the form of taxes and commissions which they learned from the Italians.|$|E

The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.|$|E
5|$|While {{guarding}} facilities, {{members of}} the Corps were largely assigned to manning brick bunkers, protecting the railway in the Ibar River valley, the Bor, Trepča, Majdanpek, and Krupanj mines, {{as well as the}} borders of the occupied territory along the Danube and Drina rivers. They were often deployed alongside various Serbian collaborationist forces such as the Serbian State Guard (SDS) and the Serbian Volunteer Corps (SDK), with whom they were most closely allied. The Corps also closely <b>cooperated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Croatian fascist Ustaše when operating in the neighbouring NDH. Members of the Corps also plundered peasants in the areas within which they operated.|$|E
5|$|According to Brackman, {{several days}} after the robbery the Okhrana agent Mukhtarov {{questioned}} Stalin in a secret apartment. The agents had heard rumors that Stalin had been seen watching passively during the robbery. Mukhtarov asked Stalin why he had not informed them about it, and Stalin stated that he had provided adequate information to the authorities to prevent the theft. The questioning escalated into a heated argument; Mukhtarov hit Stalin {{in the face and}} had to be restrained by other Okhrana officers. After this incident, Mukhtarov was suspended from the Okhrana, and Stalin was ordered to leave Tiflis and go to Baku to await a decision in the case. Stalin left Baku with 20,000rubles in stolen money in July 1907. While Brackman claims to have found evidence of this incident, whether Stalin <b>cooperated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Okhrana during his early life has been a subject of debate among historians for many decades and has yet to be resolved.|$|E

When the Kuomintang and Communist Party {{declared a}} united front to fight the Japanese, Peng was confirmed as a general in the unified command structure of the NRA. At the August 20, 1937 Lochuan Conference(洛川会议), Mao believed that the united front should {{be used as a}} feint, giving token resistance to the Japanese while saving the strength of the Red Army for the eventual confrontation with the Kuomintang, but Peng, along with most other senior military and political leaders at the time, disagreed, and believed that the Red Army should genuinely focus on fighting the Japanese. Mao was not able to force his position, and the communists <b>cooperated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kuomintang and fought the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Kenya and the National Assembly both attempted {{to stop the}} ICC process. The government appealed to both the United Nations Security Council and the Court itself regarding the admissibility of the case. The National Assembly voted in favour of removing Kenya as a state party to the Rome Statute, the international treaty which established the ICC. Despite this opposition, the suspects <b>cooperated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> proceedings and attended preliminary hearings in The Hague in April 2011 and confirmation of charges hearings in September of that year. The Pre-Trial Chamber II confirmed the charges against Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang and declined to confirm the charges against Ali, Kosgey, and Muthaura. The trial of Ruto and Sang began on 10 September 2013, while that of Kenyatta is supposed to begin on 5 February 2014. However the Chief prosecuter has asked that the case be adjourned citing lack of enough evidence required for trial.|$|E
5|$|When World War I {{began in}} August 1914, she was {{commanded}} by Captain Kanji Katō. The ship {{was ordered to}} Singapore and <b>cooperated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British to hunt down the light cruiser Emden in the East Indies and Indian Ocean. Ibuki was ordered to New Zealand to escort a large troop convoy of ANZAC troops to the Middle East in late September. She was ordered to guard the convoy, over Katō's protests, when {{the presence of the}} Emden was discovered in the Cocos Islands on 9 November. The Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney was detached from the convoy to sink the Emden instead. With the ending of the threat to the convoy, Ibuki was transferred to the Second South Seas Squadron at Truk in the Caroline Islands. She was refitted at Kure in 1918, disarmed in 1922, and stricken from the Navy List the following year and scrapped in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{force in}} Polish politics, the {{long-established}} Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS), suffered a fatal split at this time, as the ruling Stalinists applied the salami tactics to dismember the opposition. Communist politicians <b>cooperated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> left-wing PPS faction led by Józef Cyrankiewicz, prime minister under new president Bierut from February 1947. The socialists' originally tactical decision {{to collaborate with}} the communists resulted in their institutional demise. Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin in Moscow in March 1948 to discuss {{the idea of a}} party merger. The Kremlin, increasingly uncomfortable with Gomułka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972). In December 1948, after the removal of Gomułka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief, the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the Polish United Workers' Party (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza; PZPR), in power for the next four decades. Poland became a de facto one-party state and a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: United People's Party, a small farmers' party, and the Democratic Party, a token intelligentsia party (see also: political organization in Poland 1945–1989).|$|E
5|$|Raynald was {{the only}} Christian leader who fought against Saladin in the 1180s. The {{contemporaneous}} Ernoul mentioned two raids that Raynald made against caravans travelling between Egypt and Syria, breaking the truce. Modern historians debate whether Raynald's desire for booty inspired these military actions, or were deliberate maneuvers to prevent Saladin from annexing new territories. Saladin tried to seize Aleppo after As-Salih Ismail al-Malik, the Zengid emir of the town, died on 18November 1181. Raynald stormed into Saladin's territory, reaching as far as Tabuk on the route between Damascus and Mecca in late 1181. Saladin's nephew, Farrukh Shah, invaded Oultrejourdain instead of attacking Aleppo to compel Raynald to return from the Arabian desert. Before long, Raynald seized a caravan and imprisoned its members. On Saladin's protest, BaldwinIV ordered Raynald to free them, but Raynald did not obey him. His defiance annoyed the king, enabling Raymond III of Tripoli's partisans to reconcile him with the monarch. Raymond's return to the royal court {{put an end to}} his paramount position. He accepted the new situation and <b>cooperated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> king and Raymond during the fights against Saladin in summer 1182.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian {{resistance}} co-operated {{fully with}} 1st Airborne Division, often providing liaisons and performing guard duties, and the Norwegian {{population as a}} whole gave a warm welcome to the airborne troops. British forces were initially only in control of Oslo, Stavanger and Kristiansand with the resistance and, less commonly, local Norwegian authorities taking control {{of the rest of the}} country from the Germans. The resistance also helped the division discover the fate of 1st Airborne Division troops assigned to Operation Freshman, a failed attempt in November 1942 to sabotage the Norsk Hydro chemical plant at Vemork, which produced heavy water for Nazi Germany's atomic weapons programme. Two gliders had been assigned to the operation, and both had crash-landed after being released by the aircraft towing them. The men who survived the crashes were executed shortly after being captured. Although the local Norwegian population could not prevent the prisoners being executed, they later recovered their remains and reinterred them in marked graves. When it arrived, 1st Airborne Division was informed of the fate of the operation and <b>cooperated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian government to have a memorial erected and the fallen men buried with full military honours at Stavanger and Oslo.|$|E
