The chief course builder is usually an experienced competitor who understands what equipment is legal, how it must be configured, how each must be aligned compared to other obstacles, and can direct several course-building volunteers to efficiently move the equipment into place. To make the job easier, courses are often marked {{in some way to}} correspond to a grid: for example, if <b>course</b> <b>maps</b> are printed on a grid of 10-foot-by-10-foot squares, the posts that hold the ring ropes marking the course's four sides are often set 10 feet apart.|$|R

40|$|Curriculum {{design is}} a complex task. One tool used in the design process is {{curriculum}} mapping. A mandated transition from a quarter to a semester academic calendar, alongside preparation of accreditation self-study materials, provided an opportunity for faculty teaching in an entry-level occupational therapy program to review the underlying basis of the curriculum. Two taxonomies of learning (Bloom’s cognitive domain and Fink’s taxonomy of significant learning experiences) were used to examine existing courses and to consider how learning outcomes and experiences varied over the sequence of courses in the curriculum. This {{led to the creation}} of a series of <b>course</b> <b>maps</b> that have been useful in informing current curriculum design and guiding future work. In this article, the authors describe the context under which this review took place, briefly review the pertinent literature relating to curriculum design and mapping in occupational therapy education, discuss the mapping process, and provide examples of <b>course</b> <b>maps.</b> The authors reflect on the process and plans for using what was learned in future curricular design projects...|$|R
