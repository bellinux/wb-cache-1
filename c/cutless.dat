40|$|SP 5075 (now commercially {{available}} as "Legacy" was evaluated as a post emergence herbicide on both non-overseeded and overseeded Tifway bermudagrass turf. From October 2007, to April 2008, monthly application rates of Legacy (alone) were applied at SP 5075 @ 14. 7 oz/product/acre, 22. 1 oz/product/acre and at 29. 4 oz/product/acre, along with SP 5075 @ 14. 7 oz/product/acre & <b>Cutless</b> @ 8. 0 oz/product/acre, Primo Maxx alone at 22 oz/product/acre, and <b>Cutless</b> alone at 16 oz/product/acre. Chemical product applications {{did not affect}} emergence and treatments containing the formulated product of Legacy showed no inhibition. All treatments had enhanced turfgrass color over the UTC (untreated control) throughout all eight months of the test. The high rate of Legacy exhibited a brief decrease in density, color and quality form late November and into December. The high rate of Legacy produced {{the least amount of}} Poa annua cover, the greatest unmowed height suppression, the greatest seed head suppression and vegetative weed control of all treatments, and produced the least discontinuous surface. <b>Cutless</b> alone produced similar turf and Poa annua effects as the tank mix of Legacy at the low rate plus the inclusion of <b>Cutless</b> at 8. 0 oz /prod/acre. The high rate of Legacy did not eliminate flowering, but postponed flowering of Poa annua well past the flushes of the UTC, noting that there was much less Poa annua present from this treatment when overseeded. Primo Maxx alone caused minimal seed head suppression of Poa annua, and minimal weed control of total Poa cover and seed heads. Best estimates of transition occurred on 30 June 2008, were treated overseeded turfs ranged from 58 % to 80 % bermudagrass cover, with 80 % cover for Primo alone, with <b>Cutless</b> alone having 58 % bermudagrass (UTC = 84 %). Since the medium rate of Legacy produced similar Poa activity effects with better turf quality after overseeding (but then decreased in Poa activity afterwards), applications of the medium rate from initial overseed followed by subsequent applications at the high rate starting in January should be investigated for economic, turf performance and weed control performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{journal in}} case of a water cooled Submersible motor is the bearing surface of the rotor which {{consists}} of hard chromed stainless steel material. The bearing consists of a Leaded bronze material (Bronze grade LTB 2, 3 or 4 of IS 318 or Nitrile / <b>cutless</b> rubber) which is the softer part out these two. The failures of the bearing bush accounts for 90 % of the failures in a submersible motor. The implication of this failure is the complete breakdown of the Motor i. e. the windings will get damaged and expensive repairs would be required to be carried out. This clearly suggests that the design of such a journal should be properly investigated. A CFD approach would assist in establishing the dimension (length) of the bearing. This paper presents step by step application of CFD to optimize the bearing length and is an outcome of around 3 years of extensive research in an attempt to solve a manufacturerâ€™s long standing problem.
