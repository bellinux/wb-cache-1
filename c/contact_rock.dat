40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} <b>contact</b> <b>rock</b> {{paintings}} from three sites in northwestern Arnhem Land, Australia. In doing so we highlight that such sites provide some of the only contemporary Indigenous accounts of cross-cultural encounters that took place across northern Australia through the last 500 years. Importantly, they {{have the potential to}} inform us about the ongoing relationships that existed between different parties. The lack of research on <b>contact</b> <b>rock</b> art is emphasised {{and the development of a}} large-scale project (of which this fieldwork is part) aimed at addressing this problem is outlined. Important new findings for <b>contact</b> <b>rock</b> art are presented, including evidence for ‘traditional’ protocols relating to rock art continuing long after first contact, evidence for particular contact period subject matter dominating in art of this region, and the oldest date yet recorded for contact art in Australia...|$|E
40|$|The {{mineralogy}} and petrology of two kimberlites, {{a peripheral}} monticellite kimberlite, and its core of phlogopite kimberlite, from the West Auxiliary Pipe at Dutoitspan Mine are described. The mineralogy {{of the two}} kimberlites differs mainly {{in the presence of}} phlogopite macrocrysts, greater abundance of angular crustal inclusions, more heavy minerals and higher diamond grade in the phlogopite type. Microprobe analyses of olivine, phlogopite, monticellite, oxide minerals and garnet are presented. Silicate compositions are comparable in both kimberlites and zoning of olivine grains is typically towards a rim of Fo₈₉₋₉₀ʻ irrespective of whether cores are more Fe-rich or more Mg-rich. This is caused by re-equilibration after fluidised emplacement in the earth's crust of macrocryst-bearing kimberlite magma. Olivine aggregates were derived from sheared mantle lherzolite and single-crystal macrocrysts were formed at higher mantle levels from a kimberlitic crystal-mush magma. This was emplaced in the crust by rapid gas streaming. The post-fluidisation phenocrysts of olivine and phlogopite which formed then are in general more Fe-rich than macrocrysts. Re-equilibration of ilmenite results in the formation of complex perovskite and titanomagnetite mantles. Phlogopite macrocrysts are preserved in the monticellite <b>contact</b> <b>rock</b> where rapid quenching prevented their resorption and allowed separation of an immiscible carbonate melt, giving the abundant groundmass calcite. Atoll-textured spinels are found in the <b>contact</b> <b>rock.</b> Major and minor trace-element analyses of whole rock samples are presented and discussed, bringing into account the problem of contamination by crustal inclusions. Whole rock chemistry supports derivation of the kimberlites as partial melts of mantle material {{in the presence of a}} lithophile-element-enriched fluid. The monticellite <b>contact</b> <b>rock</b> is highly enriched in REE, Nb, and Sr due to rapid freezing of this perovskite-enriched phase. The monticellite type is more enriched in lithophile elements than the phlogopite type, which supports derivation of the monticellite type by a small degree of partial melting, further melting reducing the relative concentrations of lithophile elements to give the phlogopite kimberlite chemistry...|$|E
40|$|In {{the hills}} and in the plain of the Khale area are exposed two sheets of quartz-dolerite, the upper sheet being locally mushroom-shaped. The rock {{corresponds}} loosely with the Downes mountain type of dolorite, and contains numerous horizons of coarse-grained dolorite-pegmatite. The plagioclase felspars are described with special reference to the variation of grain-size, the features of zoned crystals, and the possible causes of a peculiar brown clouding in the basic zones of the crystals. Phenocrysts of augite and pigeonite, as well as plagioclase are recorded in the chilled <b>contact</b> <b>rock.</b> The micrometric data indicate that the mineral composition of the specimens is largely governed by the oxidation state of the iron, and that the Soret effect has caused the marginal rock to be enriched in basic elements. Hydrothermal veinlets composed largely of chlorite occur in both the dolorite and the country rock, and evidence suggests that veins of both residual material and mobilised granite occur in the upper finer-grained dolorite...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates contact {{histories}} {{in northern}} Australia through {{an analysis of}} recent rock paintings. Around Australia Aboriginal artists have produced a unique record of their experiences of contact since the earliest encounters with South-east Asian and, later, European visitors and settlers. This rock art archive provides irreplaceable contemporary accounts of Aboriginal attitudes towards, and engagement with, foreigners on their shores. Since 2008 our team has been working to document contact period rock art in north-western and western Arnhem Land. This paper focuses on findings from a site complex known as Malarrak. It includes the most thorough analysis of <b>contact</b> <b>rock</b> art yet undertaken {{in this area and}} questions previous interpretations of subject matter and the relationship of particular paintings to historic events. Contact period rock art from Malarrak presents us with an illustrated history of international relationships in this isolated part of the world. It not only reflects the material changes brought about by outside cultural groups but also highlights the active role Aboriginal communities took in responding to these circumstances.

40|$|The {{structure}} and lithology of {{a sequence of}} Mesozoic greywackes comprising the Torlesse terrane within the southern Ruahine Range has been mapped. At a scale of 1 : 25 000 the sequence was subdivided into informal lithozones {{with one or more}} lithozones constituting a higher order lithostratigraphic unit here referred to as a Lithotype. Each of three recognised Lithotypes occupies a consistent stratigraphic position throughout a 40 km long mapped area. From east to west the three Lithotypes are: (1) the Tamaki Lithotype; (2) the Wharite Lithotype; and (3) the Western Lithotype. The easternmost Tamaki Lithotype and the westernmost Western Lithotype consist of a relatively undeformed flysch-type sequence of distal turbidites. The centrally located wharite Lithotype structurally underlies the Tamaki Lithotype but overlies the Western Lithotype. It comprises a complex sequence of predominantly flysch-type sedimentary rocks, together with lithologically diverse, argillite-dominated, clast-bearing debris flow deposits; large sheet-like bodies of massive volcanics (and associated cherts) that have been emplaced by gravitational sliding; and intact pillow lava accumulations and horizons of red and green argillite of syndepositional origin. Major and trace element analyses of volcanic lithologies indicate that most samples were erupted in a mid-ocean ridge or intraplate setting. None appear to have been derived from an island arc setting. The bulk of the clastic sediments consist of reworked materials derived by the erosion of a mixed volcano-plutonic source and redeposited in a distal deep-water submarine fan environment. Blocks of allochthonous fossiliferous shallow-water lithologies indicate that the source terrane, in part, comprised rocks of Late Triassic age. Autochthonous fossils indicate that sedimentation continued until at least Late Jurassic time. Part of the stratigraphic sequence was severely deformed along a low angle thrust zone in Early Cretaceous time {{at the onset of the}} Rangitata Orogeny. An early phase of ductile deformation resulted in plastically and permanently deformed rocks. Ductile deformation is restricted to strata comprising the Wharite Lithotype which, with its allochthonous debris, in part, constitutes an olistostrome that has undergone tectonic deformation and hence also constitutes a melange. Thus it may be regarded as a tectonised olistostrome. Ductile deformation was succeeded by the development of shear fractures during subsequent phases of brittle deformation that affected strata comprising all three Lithotypes. Brittle deformation occurred in conjunction with episodes of faulting and folding during the second orogeny - the Kaikoura Orogeny in Pliocene to Recent times. Active faults that were initiated during the early phase of ductile deformation continued to be sites of active fault displacement throughout Quaternary and Holocene time. Late Quaternary tectonic features along these major active faults have been mapped. Minimum rates of vertical fault displacements since Ohakean time approximate 1 mm/yr in this area. Several phases of folding were recognised, including: (1) an early phase of syndepositional, highly asymmetric folds with well developed axial plane cleavage; and (2) three post-lithification phases of folding - e. g. (a) steeply plunging isoclinal folds; (b) subhorizontal, open asymmetric folds; and (c) steeply plunging open folds. Contacts between the three Lithotypes are not thought to be major tectonic breaks but are instead of primary depositional origin and have become sites of subsequent fault movement in Quaternary time. The three Lithotypes may therefore represent a near complete eastward dipping, westward younging overturned stratigraphic sequence. They are not fault-bound terranes. Metamorphism to prehnite pumpellyite grade, folding and rotation of the strata to its present steep attitude predates Late Cretaceous sedimentation. The westward rotation and imbrication of thrust sheets that are internally westward younging but form part of a regionally eastward younging succession of thrust sheets was the result of underthrusting at a convergent plate margin. The relationship between structural and lithological characteristics of the Torlesse bedrock and the magnitude of valley slope erosion in the southern Ruahine Range is investigated. Comparison of aerial photographs spanning a 28 year period between 1946 and 1974 indicate that erosion has increased by 91 %. The greatest proportion of this eroded area occurs on the steeper north- and west-facing slopes. Saturation of colluvium during major storm events is the prime triggering mechanism for the majority of shallow translational slope movements. Debris slides and debris avalanches predominate and result from failure at less than 1 m depth at the colluvium-bedrock <b>contact.</b> <b>Rock</b> slides are few in number and are structurally controlled, failing along bedding plane surfaces at greater than 1 m depth. Rock falls and rock topples are least numerous and only involve small quantities of material. An erosion rate of 1215 m 3 /ha/yr for the southern Ruahine Range is of the same order of magnitude as other New Zealand and overseas studies and although considered to be severe it is not unduly excessive. Much of the forest deterioration in this area is due to the opening of the canopy by the successive removal of large tracts of forest vegetation through mass movement processes during episodes of increased rainfall. Large-scale rotational and translational mass movement features including rock slumps, earth slumps, earth slides and ridge-top features (involving bedrock only), have been documented from 109 localities. A relationship between the incidence of rock slumps and major fault breccia zones has been established in this area. The majority of large-scale mass movement features failed in pre-historic time but two failed in historic time. The consequences of future mass movements upon lowland areas adjacent to the base of the Range is discussed. A map showing the relative stability of slopes and the predominant forms of slope movement most likely to occur under the present seismic, climatic, physiographic and human conditions is presente...|$|E

40|$|The thrust {{contact between}} the Togo and the Dahomeyan {{formations}} in Ghana is a lithotectonic boundary that exists between two major Precambrian formations which are of importance to geologists owing {{to the fact that}} Precambrian rocks in Ghana host almost all economic minerals and metals. The lithostratigraphy of the Togo-Dahomyan thrust <b>contact</b> <b>rocks</b> from a borehole in Kwabenya near Accra (the Capital of Ghana) has been studied and major crustal chemical elements assayed using Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) techniques. The results have revealed elemental compositions and the mineralogical make up of the lithostratigraphic units of these <b>contact</b> <b>rocks</b> and the general geology of the Togo and the Dahomeyan formations.
