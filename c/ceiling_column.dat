In some cases, gilding or inlaid pieces of colored glass or faience substituted for paint.|$|R

50|$|In 1929, a $6-million east wing {{addition}} by Montreal architect John Archibald and CN’s architect John Schofield along Mackenzie Avenue added 240 rooms. Although {{the exterior}} of the addition was French-inspired, the interior lobby resembled an English or Scottish baronial hall with dark-oak panelling, a railed gallery overlooking the double-height space and trophies of the hunt. The lobby led to a convention hall, music room and gentlemen’s lounge. The ballroom featured vaulted <b>ceiling,</b> <b>columns</b> and rich drapes. The ultra-modern kitchen was designed to cater to up to 5,000 people. The Jasper Tea Room designed by Edwin Holgate in 1929, featured Pacific Coast aboriginal art, columns carved into totem poles surrounding a dance floor, and lamps decorated with motifs of bears, eagles and crows. From 1929-1991, the Canadian Grill was a softly-lit and dark-panelled below-ground restaurant where diners ate the specialty, roast prime rib of beef au jus and danced to live music.|$|R
5000|$|Cineplex Odeon {{made plans}} to open their half of the theatre {{despite the lack of}} an {{entrance}} on Yonge Street. This meant replacing the fire exits, which were all on the Famous Players' end of the main theatre building. Initial plans were to completely gut their half and build a new multiplex cinema, which would augment the nearby Eaton Centre Cineplex, increasing their presence in downtown Toronto. However, because of the elegant grand lobby, vaulted ornate plaster <b>ceilings,</b> <b>columns</b> and grand staircase, plans to gut the building and build as many as eight screens were dropped, and instead plans were drawn up for a three-screen cinema utilizing as much of the existing interior as possible. This would maintain the historic grandness which did not exist in any of the other theatre properties owned and operated by Cineplex Odeon, as most of them dated from after World War II when J. Arthur Rank came to Canada to start Odeon Theatres of Canada.|$|R

The cooling system cooled the basement and first floor.|$|R

5|$|Mosaics {{are among}} the most {{enduring}} of Roman decorative arts, and are found on the surfaces of floors and other architectural features such as walls, vaulted <b>ceilings,</b> and <b>columns.</b> The most common form is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces (tesserae) of materials such as stone and glass. Mosaics were usually crafted on site, but sometimes assembled and shipped as ready-made panels. A mosaic workshop was led by the master artist (pictor) who worked with two grades of assistants.|$|R
