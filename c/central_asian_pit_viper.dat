50|$|The Crotalinae, {{commonly}} known as <b>pit</b> <b>vipers,</b> crotaline snakes (named for the κρόταλον krotalon castanet/rattle of a rattlesnake's tail), or pit adders, are a subfamily of venomous vipers found in Eurasia and the Americas. They are distinguished {{by the presence of}} a heat-sensing pit organ located between the eye and the nostril {{on either side of the}} head. Currently, 18 genera and 151 species are recognized: seven genera and 54 species in the Old World, against a greater diversity of 11 genera and 97 species in the New World. These are also the only viperids found in the Americas. The groups of snakes represented here include rattlesnakes, lanceheads, and <b>Asian</b> <b>pit</b> <b>vipers.</b> The type genus for this subfamily is Crotalus, of which the type species is the timber rattlesnake, C. horridus.|$|R

40|$|For a long time, {{the genus}} Trimeresurus (sensu lateral) {{has been known}} to consist of over 40 species of <b>Asian</b> <b>pit</b> <b>vipers.</b> It is now divided into four {{recognized}} gen-era: Trimeresurus, Ovophis, Protobothrops and Trop-idolaemus [1]. The arboreal Trimeresurus (sensu stricto) are indigenous to south and south-eastern Asia. It should be noted that data from morphological and mtDNA analyses suggest that Trimeresurus (sensu stricto) is possibly derived from more than one ances-tral species and should be considered as a polyphyletic group [1 – 3]. However, their venom components have not been well studied except for those of the green bamboo vipers Trimeresurus stejnegeri [4]. Distin-guished by a yellow–brown skin color, Trimeresurus puniceus and Trimeresurus borneensis only inhabit Sumantra, Java and adjacent areas [5]. Previous phylo-genetic studies suggest that both species are primitive and closely related to several Trimeresurus species in the Indian subcontinent [1]. Snake venoms are characteristic, with specific phar-macological activities and bioavailability, and thus have potential for medical applications. In addition, investigating the diversity of venom proteins may help us to understand snake systematics and their veno...|$|R
40|$|Some myotoxic or {{neurotoxic}} PLA 2 s (phospholipases A 2) from <b>pit</b> <b>viper</b> venoms contain characteristic N 6 substitutions. Our {{survey of}} the venoms of more than ten <b>pit</b> <b>viper</b> genera revealed that N 6 -PLA 2 s exist only in limited <b>Asian</b> <b>pit</b> <b>vipers</b> of two genera, Protobothrops and Gloydius, and exist as either monomers or the basic subunits of heterodimers in some New World <b>pit</b> <b>vipers.</b> For the newly identified N 6 -PLA 2 s, the neuromuscular blocking activities were assayed with the chick biventer cervicis neuromuscular tissue, whereas the increased serum creatine kinase level assessed their myotoxicities. The purified N 6 -PLA 2 s from Protobothrops mangshanensis and Gloydius intermedius saxatilis {{were found to be}} presynaptic neurotoxins. In contrast, all N 6 -PLA 2 s from the venoms of Sistrurus miliarius strackeri, S. m. barbouri, Crotalus viridis viridis, C. lepidus lepidus, Cerrophidion godmani and Bothreichis schlegelii were myotoxins without neurotoxicity even in the presence of crotoxin A. Crotoxin-like complexes were for the first time purified from the venoms of Sitrurus catenatus tergeminus, C. mitchelli mitchelli, C. horridus atricaudatus, C. basiliscus and C. durissus cumanensis. The cDNAs encoding six novel N 6 -PLA 2 s and subunits of the crotoxin-like complex from S. c. tergeminus were cloned and fully sequenced. Phylogeny analysis showed that two structural subtypes of N 6 -PLA 2 s with either F 24 or S 24 substitution have been evolved in parallel, possibly descended respectively from species related to present-day Protobothrops and Gloydius. Calmodulin binds all the N 6 -PLA 2 s but crotoxin A may inhibit its binding to crotoxin B and to other neurotoxic N 6 -PLA 2 s. Structure–activity relationships at various regions of the PLA 2 molecules were extensively discussed...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY-Intramitochondrial virus {{particles}} were observed by thin-section electron microscopy in a permanent cell line, VSW, {{derived from the}} spleen of a tumor-bearing <b>Asian</b> <b>pit</b> <b>viper.</b> Viruses were spherical in morphology and generally situated in the peripheral region of the mitochondrion. They measured approxi-mately 106 m,u in total diameter and consisted of a relatively dense nucleoid surrounded by a less-dense outer zone. The latter consisted {{of at least one}} intermediary layer enclosed by a tight-fitting envelope derived from the inner mitochondrial membrane. Probable developmental stages are described, and specula-tion concerning their possible evolutionary significance is presented. -J Natl Cancer Inst 50 : 111 - 117, 1973. A RECENTLY established reptilian cell line (VSW) derived from the spleen of a tumor-bearing Russell's viper (1) has been shown by thin-section electron microscopy (2, 3) to produce spontaneously "C-type " {{virus particles}} by a budding process similar to that known for homeothermic vertebrates (4). Several biochemical parameters have demon-strated that the viper "C-type " virus resembles those of higher vertebrates (5, 6), but it is anti-genically distinct (5). The VSW cell line is highly susceptible to infection with a number of viruses of mammalian origin (7). Superinfection with certain of these viruses (vesicular stomatitis virus, strain Indiana, and rabies virus, strain ERA) results in the simultaneous budding of both mammalian and "C-type " viruses from the plasmalemma of individual VSW cells (8). This paper concerns structural studies of control and superinfected VSW, both of which contain intra mitochondrial particles presumed, from mor-phologic considerations, to be viruses. We tentatively suggest that the intramitochondrial particles repre-sent naturally infecting "C-type " virions replicating in an unusual site...|$|R
40|$|In Thailand 29 {{patients}} were proved {{to have been}} bitten by arboreal green pit vipers: 24 by Trimeresurus albolabris and 5 by T. macrops. They were studied in order to define the clinical effects of envenoming, to characterize the haemostatic abnormalities and assess the efficacy of Thai Red Cross antivenom. T. macrops caused only local painful swelling, neutrophil leucocytosis and thrombocytopenia. T. albolabris caused more severe envenoming with local blistering and necrosis, shock, spontaneous systemic bleeding, defibrination, thrombocytopenia and leucocytosis. There {{was no evidence of}} disseminated intravascular coagulation, but fibrinolytic activity was increased. Platelet function was normal. The product of admission venom antigen concentration and the delay between bite and admission was significantly higher in defibrinated patients than in those without severe coagulopathy. Antivenom (5 ampoules intravenously) restored blood coagulability, but there was persistent venom antigenaemia, associated in some cases with recurrent coagulopathy.

40|$|Exotic (foreign or non-native) snakes, {{including}} venomous species, {{are becoming}} increasingly popular pets in Western countries. Some of them are kept illegally (as defined by the UK Dangerous Wild Animals Act of 1976). There is a large international market for such animals, with contraventions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In the UK, several other European countries and the USA the reported numbers of bites by venomous exotic snakes, although small, are increasing but still underestimate the occurrence of these occasionally fatal events because of the victims' reluctance to seek medical care. Victims are predominantly young {{men who have been}} drinking alcohol. Bites may be intentionally provoked. In Europe, the species most often involved are cobras, green mambas, American <b>pit</b> <b>vipers</b> particularly rattlesnakes, African adders, <b>vipers</b> and <b>Asian</b> green <b>pit</b> <b>vipers.</b> To illustrate the special problems involved, case histories are presented of bites by exotic species in the UK and of bites abroad, where patients were repatriated for treatment.

40|$|Abstract Background Envenoming {{by south}} <b>Asian</b> hump-nosed <b>pit</b> <b>vipers</b> (Genus: Hypnale) is a {{significant}} health issue in Sri Lanka and in peninsular India. Bites by these snakes frequently lead to local envenoming, coagulopathy and acute renal failure even resulting in death. Recently the genus was revised {{and the existence of}} three species viz H. hypnale, H. nepa and H. zara were recognized. There is, however, a paucity of information on the toxicity of the venoms of these species. Hence, we compared the toxic effects of the three Hypnale venoms using BALB/c mice. Findings Intraperitoneal median lethal doses (LD 50) for H. hypnale, H. zara and H. nepa venoms were 1. 6, 6. 0 and 9. 5 [*]μg protein/g respectively. Minimum haemorrhagic doses for venoms of H. hypnale, H. zara and H. nepa were 3. 4, 11. 0 and 16. 6 [*]μg protein/mouse respectively. The minimum necrotic doses for the same venoms were 15. 0, 55. 1 and 68. 2 [*]μg protein/mouse respectively. Severe congestion and petecheal haemorrhages were observed in lungs, kidneys, liver and the alimentary tract. Histopathogical examination of kidneys revealed proximal tubular cell injury and acute tubular necrosis with intact basement membrane indicating possible direct nephrotoxicity. Hypnale venoms caused pulmonary oedema, hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis, focal neuronal degeneration in brain and extramedullary haemopoiesis in spleen. H. hypnale venom caused all above histopathological alterations at lower doses compared to the other two. Conclusion Hypnale venoms cause similar pathological changes with marked differences in the severity of the toxic effects in vivo. Therefore, differences in the severity of the clinical manifestations could possibly be seen among bite victims of the three Hypnale species. </p...|$|R
