500|$|The layer {{covering}} the apothecia is about 30μm thick, {{and made of}} blackened (carbonized) cells measuring 5–6μm in diameter. At {{the base of the}} apothecia is carbonized supportive tissue about 5μm thick. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphal cells) are unbranched, threadlike (filiform), gradually enlarge to a width of 2.0μm at the tip, and have granular contents. The thin-walled cylindrical to club-shaped asci (spore-bearing cells) are on a short stalk, and measure 70–105 by 8–10μm; each ascus contains eight ascospores. Ascospores, which measure 45–65 by 3.0μm, have a thin but distinct sheath, and lack septa (cross-walls). Pycnidia (which appear before the apothecia mature) are intraepidermal, [...] (having the shape of a double-convex lens) in cross section, 0.1–0.3mm in diameter, and covered with a dark brown layer of cells. The phialides are arranged in a basal layer, and borne on short conidiophores. They are slender and subulate (tapering to a point), lack a <b>collarette,</b> and measure 5–10 by 2–2.5μm. The conidia are colorless, rod-shaped, lack septa, and have dimensions of 4–5 by 1.0μm.|$|E
6000|$|His {{own stock}} {{remained}} on hand. Time, like a slow whirlpool churned it over into sight {{and out of}} sight, like a mass of dead sea-weed in a backwash. There was a regular series of sales fortnightly. The display of [...] "creations" [...] fell off. The new entertainment was the Friday-night's sale. James would attack some portion of his stock, make a wild jumble of it, spend a delirious Wednesday and Thursday marking down, and then open on Friday afternoon. In the evening there was a crush. A good moiré underskirt for one-and-eleven-three {{was not to be}} neglected, and a handsome string-lace <b>collarette</b> for six-three would iron out and be worth at least three-and-six. That was how it went: it would nearly all of it iron out into something really nice, poor James' crumpled stock. His fine, semi-transparent face flushed pink, his eyes flashed as he took in the sixpences and handed back knots of tape or packets of pins for the notorious farthings. What matter if the farthing change had originally cost him a halfpenny! His shop was crowded with women peeping and pawing and turning things over and commenting in loud, unfeeling tones. For there were still many comic items. Once, for example, he suddenly heaped up piles of hats, trimmed and untrimmed, the weirdest, sauciest, most screaming shapes. Woodhouse enjoyed itself that night.|$|E
50|$|As {{a member}} of the genus Lecythophora, it is {{considered}} to be poorly differentiated morphologically. Lecythophora hoffmannii colonies range in colour from a pale salmon to a pallid orange, with degenerate strains presenting a creamy white colour. Colonies are also flat, smooth and moist. <b>Collarettes</b> are distinct, yet unpigmented, while conidia are also hyaline, smooth, and thin-walled. The production of slimy, orange to salmon-colored colonies on short adelophialides with cylindrical <b>collarettes</b> can be quite distinct, with ventricose phialide formations less frequent. Narrow and hyaline, hyphae, through the use of small <b>collarettes,</b> produce conidia directly upon them laterally, directly upon the vegetative hyphae. Alternatively, flask-shaped lateral cells, which are practically cylindrical, can serve as the medium through which conidia are produced; they are sometimes found to be arranged in densely packed groups. Conidia are slightly curved, appearing broadly ellipsoidal to cylindrical to bean-shaped; measurements vary from 3.5-7.0 µm in length by 1.0-2.5 µm in width, to 3.0-3.5 µm by 1.5-2.5 µm.|$|R

60|$|Lenehan {{observed}} {{them for}} a few minutes. Then he walked rapidly along beside the chains at some distance and crossed the road obliquely. As he approached Hume Street corner he found the air heavily scented and his eyes made a swift anxious scrutiny of the young woman's appearance. She had her Sunday finery on. Her blue serge skirt {{was held at the}} waist by a belt of black leather. The great silver buckle of her belt seemed to depress the centre of her body, catching the light stuff of her white blouse like a clip. She wore a short black jacket with mother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged black boa. The ends of her tulle <b>collarette</b> had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in her bosomm stems upwards. Lenehan's eyes noted approvingly her stout short muscular body. Frank rude health glowed in her face, on her fat red cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes. Her features were blunt. She had broad nostrils, a straggling mouth which lay open in a contented leer, and two projecting front teeth. As he passed Lenehan took off his cap and, after about ten seconds, Corley returned a salute to the air. This he did by raising his hand vaguely and pensively changing the angle of position of his hat.|$|E
60|$|She {{received}} us very kindly, {{with hand}} stretched out, which I, {{with a natural}} emotion (I assure you my heart beat), stooped and kissed, when she said quickly, 'Mais non, je ne veux pas,' and kissed my lips. She is somewhat large for her height--not tall--and was dressed with great nicety {{in a sort of}} grey serge gown and jacket, made after the ruling fashion just now, and fastened up to the throat, plain linen <b>collarette</b> and sleeves. Her hair was uncovered, divided on the forehead in black, glossy bandeaux, and twisted up behind. The eyes and brow are noble, and the nose is of a somewhat Jewish character; the chin a little recedes, and the mouth is not good, though mobile, flashing out a sudden smile with its white projecting teeth. There is no sweetness in the face, but great moral as well as intellectual capacities--only it never could have been a beautiful face, which a good deal surprised me. The chief difference in it since it was younger is probably that the cheeks are considerably fuller than they used to be, but this of course does not alter the type. Her complexion is of a deep olive. I observed that her hands were small and well-shaped. We sate with her perhaps three-quarters of an hour or more--in which time she gave advice and various directions to two or three young men who were there, showing her confidence in us by the freest use of names and allusion to facts. She seemed to be, in fact, the man in that company, and the profound respect with which she was listened to a good deal impressed me. You are aware from the newspapers that she came to Paris for the purpose of seeing the President in behalf of certain of her friends, and that it was a successful mediation. What is peculiar in her manners and conversation is the absolute simplicity of both. Her voice is low and rapid, without emphasis or variety of modulation. Except one brilliant smile, she was grave--indeed, she was speaking of grave matters, and many of her friends are in adversity. But you could not help seeing (both Robert and I saw it) that in all she said, even in her kindness and pity, there was an under-current of scorn. A scorn of pleasing she evidently had; there never could have been a colour of coquetry in that woman. Her very freedom from affectation and consciousness had a touch of disdain. But I liked her. I did not love her, but I felt the burning soul through all that quietness, and was not disappointed in George Sand. When we rose to go I could not help saying, 'C'est pour la dernière fois,' and then she asked us to repeat our visit next Sunday, and excused herself from coming to see us on the ground of a great press of engagements. She kissed me again when we went away, and Robert kissed her hand.|$|E

40|$|A new hyphomycete genus, Phaeoacremonium, is {{proposed}} for five new species, P. aleophilum, P. angustius, P. chlamydosporum, P. inflatipes, P. rubrigenum, {{and the type}} species, P. parasiticum, which was formerly accommodated in Phialophora. Morphologically, the genus is intermediate between Acremonium and Phialophora. It is distinguished from Phialophora by its aculeate conidiogenous cells and inconspicuous <b>collarettes,</b> and from Acremonium by its pigmented vegetative hyphae and conidiophores. Because species of Phaeoacremonium {{have been associated with}} human infections and disease symptoms of several woody hosts, this new genus is considered to represent an ecologically important group of fungi.

50|$|The {{morphological}} {{forms of}} F. compacta {{are referred to}} as RhinocIadiella-like, Cladosporium-Iike, and Phialophora-like. The Rhinocladiella-like and Phialophora-like types of development are best referred to as additional anamorphs of Fonsecaea. Some isolates of Fonsecaea may form phialides with <b>collarettes</b> that are typical of the genus Phialophora. When fungi produce more than one morphologic form in culture, such as the case with F. compacta and F. pedrosoi, the most stable, distinct, and unique form that is produced under standard conditions are used for identifying the fungus. Colonies on potato dextrose agar are slow growing, velvety to woolly, and olive to olivaceous black in color. Isolates of F. compacta may produce up to four different types of conidiophores. The diagnostic form consists of densley clustered, one-celled, pale brown, primary conidia, up to 4 × 8 μm that develop irregularly upon pegs at the terminus of erect, dark, irregularly swollen, club shaped, conidiophores. The primary conidia give rise to one-celled, 3 × 3.5 μm, secondary conidia in a like manner. The secondary conidia may in turn give rise to tertiary conidia. The conidia are rounded and form compact heads. Conidiophores bearing one-celled conidia like those produced by Rhinocladiella, branched chains of one-celled conidia arising from erect conidiophores like those produced by Cladosporium, and flask-shaped phialides having flared <b>collarettes</b> and balls of one-celled conidia like those produced by Phialophora may also be present. On average, sizes range from 5 to 20 μm in diameter.|$|R
50|$|The <b>collarette</b> is the {{thickest}} {{region of the}} iris, separating the pupillary portion from the ciliary portion. The <b>collarette</b> is a rudiment of the coating of the embryonic pupil. It is typically defined as the region where the sphincter muscle and dilator muscle overlap. Radial ridges extend from the periphery to the pupillary zone, to supply the iris with blood vessels. The root of the iris is the thinnest and most peripheral.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} white grain eumycetoma of the foot of an Indian male caused by a slow-growing, poorly sporulating fungus that does not match any known agent of this infection. Histologic examination of a biopsy tissue specimen showed oval, lobular, white granules composed of hyaline, septate hyphae, and thick-walled chlamydospores. Culture of granules from a draining sinus yielded compact, very-slow-growing, poorly sporulating colonies producing a strong reddish brown pigment that diffused into the medium. The fungus {{was identified as a}} Cylindrocarpon sp. based on the development of rare cylindrical conidia borne from solitary phialides lacking <b>collarettes,</b> in addition to chlamydospores formed singly or in short chains...|$|R
5000|$|Phialemonium curvatum is a {{pathogenic}} fungus in the phylum Ascomycota. The genus {{was created}} to accommodate taxa intermediate to Acremonium and Phialophora. [...] This genus is characterized by its abundance of adelophialides and few discrete phialides with no signs of <b>collarettes.</b> Specifically, P. curvatum is characterized by its grayish white colonies and its allantoid conidia. Phialemonium curvatum is typically found {{in a variety of}} environments including air, soil, industrial water and sewage. Furthermore, P. curvatum affects mainly immunocompromised and is rarely seen in immunocompetent people. [...] The species has been known to cause peritonitis, endocarditis, endovascular infections, osteomyelitis as well as cutaneous infections of wounds and burns.|$|R
50|$|Although conidation, {{a form of}} asexual reproduction, in M. mycetomatis is rare, {{two main}} types can be {{described}} in-vitro. In the first type oval to pyriform conidia, 3 to 5 µm can be observed. The conidia have truncated bases and are on the tips of simple or branched conidiophores. In-vitro, this type of conidation {{can be observed in}} 50% of cultures on soil extract, hay infusion or water agar. When grown on potato carrot agar or cornmeal agar the second type of conidation is observed. This type is characterized by small spherical conidia (3 µm in diameter) on tapered tips of flask shaped phialides and <b>collarettes.</b> On SDA media M. mycetomatis is sterile. No sexual stage has been identified for M. mycetomatis.|$|R

25|$|Exophiala dermatitidis forms slow growing, {{brown or}} black colonies. As is common amongst black yeasts, E. dermatitidis is an {{anamorphic}} fungus with multiple conidial forms. This morphological plasticity has complicated taxonomic determination {{based solely on}} physical appearance. Young colonies are described as waxy, mucoid, smooth, and yeastlike. Over time pigmented aerial hyphae develop, and older colonies are described as appearing filamentous and velvety. Conidia are between globular and elliptical in shape, and form {{at the mouth of}} short annellidic conidiogenous cells. Annellations can only be observed by electron microscopy. Prior to analysis by scanning electron microscope, the condiogenous cells were observed to form from non-annelated phialides and phialides without <b>collarettes.</b> These observations caused the species to be erroneously provided with its own monotypic genus, Wangiella. The species name Wangiella dermatitidis is still commonly used in the scientific literature.|$|R
40|$|An eleven year-old male {{castrated}} exotic shorthair cat {{presented to}} the Dermatology Service in August, 2009, for evaluation of a three week history of progressive, symmetric, non-pruritic crusting that started on the face and chin. Physical examination revealed the presence of dry, honey-colored to yellow crusts, erosions with epidermal <b>collarettes,</b> and hypotrichosis distributed in a symmetrical manner on the face, chin, nasal planum, pinnae, external ear canals, and interdigital spaces. Removal of the crusts and cytology of underlying skin revealed the presence of numerous acantholytic keratinocytes and non-degenerate neutrophils. Due to the distribution and progression of lesions, absence of pruritus, {{and the presence of}} numerous acantholytic keratinocytes and non-degenerate neutrophils, the cat was presumptively diagnosed with pemphigus foliaceus.

Histologic examination of the biopsied material from the left tibia revealed septate, irregularly branched hyphae, swollen cells, and ovate-to-spherical cells divided by a transverse septum. The majority of the fungal elements were hyaline, but a few had lightly pigmented cell walls that had a greenish yellow tint. The presence of melanin in the cell walls of the hyphae and especially in their septa was verified by the use of the Fontana-Masson silver stain. P. obovatum formed moist, off-white-to-ochraceous, spreading colonies with a characteristic green pigment on their reverse side. The pigment was more prominent in cultures grown at 37 degrees C than in those grown at 25 degrees C. The isolate also grew at 40 degrees C.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the use of}} the iris-based biometric recognition. Biometric recognition is the automated recognition of individuals based on the physiological and behavioral characteristics. The recognition can be positive or negative. It highlights the key areas where the iris biometric method has been used successfully, and what are its shortfalls. It presents an overview of the algorithm used in Iris biometric recognition. It also compares the performance of the Iris biometric method with the other biometric methods in terms of cost-effectiveness, usability, speed and other factors. The iris is very unique in that it has many features such as crypts, furrows and <b>collarettes,</b> which are used by the algorithms for comparison between a template and an image acquired for recognition. Most of the algorithms used for iris recognition have a very low false acceptance rate compared to the other biometric methods, and these algorithms can do millions of comparisons on easily available hardware. 1...|$|R

40|$|Phaeoacremonium inflatipes, one {{of three}} species {{previously}} classified as strains of Phialophora parasitica, was identified as the causal agent of a subcutaneous infection of the left foot of an 83 -year-old woman from South Carolina. The patient had a granulomatous growth over the anteromedial aspect of her left foot. It was surgically excised, which led to complete healing without complications. Tissue sections of the excised mass stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Gomori’s methenamine silver strains showed many septate hyphal elements of various lengths, some exhibiting brownish pigment in the cell walls of the hyphae. Portions of the tissue, when cultured, yielded many colonies which were initially glabrous, off white becoming velvety, greyish brown on aging. Microscopically, their hyphae were septate, branched, and phaeoid and bore lateral and terminal, erect, septate conidiophores. The conidiogenous cells (phialides) were terminal or lateral, mostly monophialidic, subcylindrical to spinelike in shape, and constricted at their bases and bore funnel-shaped, inconspicuous <b>collarettes</b> at their tips.
