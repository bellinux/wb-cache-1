40|$|Background Attrition is an {{important}} problem in <b>cohort</b> studies. <b>Tracing</b> <b>cohort</b> members who have moved or otherwise lost contact with the study is vital. There is some debate about the acceptability and relative effectiveness of opt-in versus opt-out methods of contacting cohort members to re-engage them in this context. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to compare the two approaches in terms of effectiveness (tracing to confirm address and consenting {{to continue in the}} study), cost-effectiveness and acceptability. Methods Participants in this trial were individuals (young people and mothers) recruited to the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), who had not engaged with the study in the previous 5 years and for whom mail had been returned from their last known address. The sampling frame was restricted to those for whom database searching led to a potential new address being found in the Bristol area. 300 participants were randomly selected and assigned using stratified randomisation to the opt-in or opt-out arm. A tailored letter was sent to the potential new address, either asking participants to opt in to a home visit, or giving them the option to opt out of a home visit. Fieldworkers from Ipsos MORI conducted home visits to confirm address details. Results The proportion who were traced was higher in the opt-out arm (77 / 150 [*]=[*] 51...|$|R

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{of the study}} was that social contacts to close friends and relatives and perceived social integration was able to delay mortality in general and cardiovascular mortality in particular. Altogether 1752 males and females, aged 70 - 100 years were interviewed by trained nurses in 1972 to 1974. The study group was based upon a random sample of all elderly in the town of Odense, Denmark.

Previous assessments had shown significant improvement {{between the ages of}} 6 and 8 years. METHODS [...] The original <b>cohort</b> were <b>traced</b> and were assessed using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, an update of the Test Of Motor Impairment, used at 6 and 8 years. Where possible the classroom-matched controls from the original studies were assessed, otherwise new controls were selected. Teachers were also asked to identify those children whom they considered clumsy. Forty seven of the original cohort of 53 children, all but one still attending mainstream school, and 40 original and 20 new classroom-matched controls were studied.

In 2004 - 2005, 77. 4 % of the <b>cohort</b> was <b>traced,</b> members were interviewed and 3827 individuals donated blood. Analyses of the outcome were based on a conceptual model that differentiated confounders from potential mediators. The following independent variables were studied in relation to levels of C-reactive protein in sex-stratified analyses: skin color, age, family income, education, parity, body mass index, waist circumference, smoking, fat/fiber/alcohol intake, physical activity, and minor psychiatric disorder. Geometric mean (95 % confidence interval) C-reactive protein levels for the 1919 males and 1908 females were 0. 89 (0. 84 - 0. 94) and 1. 96 mg/L (1. 85 - 2. 09), respectively. Pregnant women and those using oral contraceptive therapies presented the highest C-reactive protein levels and all sub-groups of women had higher levels than men (P < 0. 001). Significant associations between C-reactive protein levels were observed with age, socioeconomic indicators, obesity status, smoking, fat and alcohol intake, and minor psychiatric disorder.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Silica has {{recently}} been reclassified as carcinogenic to humans based largely on the observed increase in rates of lung cancer in subjects with silicosis. Other recent reviews have arrived at different conclusions as to whether silicosis or silica itself is carcinogenic. This study aims to examine exposure-response relations between exposure to silica and subsequent silicosis and lung cancer in a cohort of goldminers. METHODS: 2, 297 goldminers from Kalgoorlie in Western Australia were examined in 1961, 1974, and 1975. Data were collected on respiratory symptoms, smoking habits, and employment history. Subjects were followed {{up to the end}} of 1993. Survival analyses for lung cancer mortality and incidence of compensated silicosis were performed with age and year matched conditional logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: 89 % of the <b>cohort</b> were <b>traced</b> to the end of 1993. 84 % of the men had smoked at some time and 66 % were current smokers. 1386 deaths occurred during the follow up period, 138 from lung cancer, and 631 subjects were compensated for silicosis. A strong effect of smoking on mortality from lung cancer, and a smaller effect on the incidence of compensated silicosis was found. There was a strong effect of duration and intensity of exposure on the incidence of silicosis. The risk of mortality from lung cancer increased after compensation for silicosis. Of all direct measures of exposure to silica, only log cumulative exposure was significantly related to incidence of lung cancer, but this effect disappeared once the onset of silicosis was taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of silicosis was clearly related to exposure to silica and the onset of silicosis conferred a significant increase in risk for subsequent lung cancer, but {{there was no evidence that}} exposure to silica caused lung cancer in the absence of silicosis...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{weight gain}} in {{childhood}} {{is associated with}} increased risk of chronic diseases in adults. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a mediator of atherosclerosis and chronically elevated levels predict cardiovascular outcomes. The effects of life course weight gain on CRP levels are not clear. The 1982 Pelotas (Brazil) birth cohort study (n = 5, 914) has prospectively collected weight and health data at several follow-ups since birth. The most recent was in 2004 – 05, when 77. 4 % of the <b>cohort</b> was <b>traced</b> and CRP levels were measured in 89 % of those interviewed (n = 3827). Geometric mean (SE) C-reactive protein levels were 0. 89 mg/l (0. 03) and 1. 66 mg/l (0. 04) in men and women, respectively. In analyses adjusted for confounding variables, weight gain in infancy showed a weak negative association among males, but from the second year onwards, weight gain was positively associated with CRP levels. In females, weight gain was associated with higher CRP at every period tested. The strongest associations were observed {{in the most recent}} (18 – 23 years) period; CRP ratios (95 % CI) per z score increase in weight gain were 1. 78 (1. 57 – 2. 00) and 1. 52 (1. 30 – 1. 78) for men and women, respectively. Males who were stunted at 2 years and centrally obese at 23 years had the highest CRP levels (P = 0. 002 for interaction). In summary, rapid weight gain throughout life predicted higher CRP levels. Public health efforts need to tackle chronic under-nutrition in infancy, together with rapid weight gain in later childhood and adolescence, especially in countries undergoing the nutritional transition.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Differences between early-onset and late-onset adult asthma {{have not}} been {{comprehensively}} described using prospective data. AIMS: To characterise the differences between early-onset and late-onset asthma in a longitudinal cohort study. METHODS: The Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS) is a population-based cohort. Respiratory histories and spirometry were first performed in 1968 when participants were aged 7 (n= 8583). The <b>cohort</b> was <b>traced</b> and resurveyed from 2002 to 2005 (n= 5729 responses) and a sample, enriched for asthma and bronchitis participated in a clinical study when aged 44 (n= 1389). RESULTS: Of the entire TAHS cohort, 7. 7 % (95 % CI 6. 6 % to 9. 0 %) had early-onset and 7. 8 % (95 % CI 6. 4 % to 9. 4 %) late-onset asthma. Atopy and family history were more common in early-onset asthma while female gender, current smoking and low socioeconomic status were more common in late-onset asthma. The impact on lung function of early-onset asthma was significantly greater than for late-onset asthma (mean difference prebronchodilator (BD) FEV 1 /FVC - 2. 8 % predicted (- 5. 3 to - 0. 3); post-BD FEV 1 FVC - 2. 6 % predicted (- 5. 0 to - 0. 1)). However, asthma severity and asthma score did not significantly differ between groups. An interaction between asthma and smoking was identified and {{found to be associated}} with greater fixed airflow obstruction in adults with late-onset asthma. This interaction was not evident in adults with early-onset disease. CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset and late-onset adult asthma are equally prevalent in the middle-aged population.

Remission of asthma in middle aged and elderly subjects was investigated {{as part of a}} population based study of respiratory diseases in Northern Sweden.  METHODS—In 1986 86 % of 6610 subjects participated in a questionnaire survey. After a clinical validation study 300 subjects were diagnosed as having current asthma. In 1996 5935 subjects of the <b>cohort</b> could be <b>traced</b> for a third survey and 87 % participated. Of the subjects with current asthma in 1986, 267 participated. In addition, 60 symptomatic subjects were classified as suspected asthma and 58 of them participated in 1996. Remission of asthma was defined as no recurrent wheeze, no attacks of shortness of breath, and no use of asthma medicines in 1996.  RESULTS—Remission of asthma during the 10 year period under study was 6 %. In subjects with suspected asthma, remission occurred in 22 %. The average annual remission rate was less than 1 %. Remission was associated with previously mild disease and cessation of smoking.  CONCLUSION—Remission of asthma or the disappearance of its symptoms to an asymptomatic latent phase appeared to be rare in middle aged and elderly subjects. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to begin to explore some of the recent trends and {{attributes}} of sole parenting in New Zealand, but from a from a child-centered rather than a parentfocused perspective. Reports that the proportions of children living in sole parent families have significantly increased have been the source of much concern, and even ‘moral panic’, over recent quinquennia. Sole parent households made up nine per cent of all households in 1976, and were up to 19 per cent by 1991. Advocates of family values allege that the traditional family unit is breaking down, and that this will have negative consequences for society and for our children. Previous research into the issue of sole parent families has been largely based on census information, producing snapshot-like pictures of the situation at one point in time. This paper begins to offer a more thorough look into some of the trends and processes at work by adopting the benefits of a longitudinal, retrospective survey that <b>traces</b> <b>cohorts</b> of children through their childhood. By following different cohorts through their family experiences during childhood, we can begin to build up a picture about if and how experiences of sole parenting have changed over time, and can begin to speculate about the situation for today’s children...|$|R

Methods Based on the Guangzhou Occupational Health Surveillance Record System established in 1989 - 1992, 80 987 factory workers, aged≥ 30, occupationally exposed to dust and non-exposure to dust, {{were included in}} a prospective cohort study. Results (1) The {{mean age of the}} cohort was 43. 5. Most subjects were workers, with secondary education, and married. Out of them 16. 3 % having ever exposed to dust, 43. 7 % ever smoked and 33. 5 % drank-alcohol. (2) The <b>cohort</b> were <b>traced</b> for 8 years on average, but 35 were lost for follow-up. Malignant neoplasm was most commonly seen among 1539 deaths. (3) The adjusted relative risk (RRs) of death of all causes, malignant neoplasm and cerebro-cardiovascular diseases for dust exposed workers were close to those for smokers. However, the adjusted RRs of death of nasopharynx cancer and respiratory system diseases for dust exposed workers were higher than those for smokers. The adjusted RRs of death of lung cancer and stomach cancer for smokers were 2. 2 times and 1. 5 times of that for dust exposed workers respectively. Dust exposure combined with smoking caused significantly higher death RR. (4) In males, the adjusted RRs of death of all causes, malignant neoplasm and respiratory system diseases for silica dust exposed workers and the adjusted RR of death of cerebro-cardiovascular diseases for wood dust exposed workers were higher those in smokers. (5) The population attributable risk percentage (PARP) of all causes of death for smokers was 2. 5 times of that for dust exposed workers. (6) In males, the risks of death for all causes, malignant neoplasm, lung cancer and stomach cancer increased with the amount of smoking per day and the duration of smoking. The risks of death caused by coronary heart disease and respiratory system diseases were increasing with the amount of smoking per day and the duration of smoking respectively. Conclusions The adjusted RRs for dust exposed workers were close to those for smokers with dust exposure and smoking having synergistic effects. Some of the adjusted RRs for smokers were higher than those for dust exposed workers PARP for smokers was higher than that for dust exposed workers.

40|$|Abstract Background Abnormal {{blood glucose}} (BG) {{concentrations}} {{have been associated}} with increased morbidity and mortality in both critically ill adults and infants. Furthermore, hypoglycaemia and glycaemic variability have both been independently linked to mortality in these patients. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices have the potential to improve detection and diagnosis of these glycaemic abnormalities. However, sensor noise is a trade-off of the high measurement rate and must be managed effectively if CGMs are going to be used to monitor, diagnose and potentially help treat glycaemic abnormalities. Aim To develop a tool that will aid clinicians in identifying unusual CGM behaviour and highlight CGM data that potentially need to be interpreted with care. Methods CGM data and BG measurements from 50 infants at risk of hypoglycaemia were used. Unusual CGM measurements were classified using a stochastic model based on the kernel density method and historical CGM measurements from the <b>cohort.</b> CGM <b>traces</b> were colour coded with very unusual measurements coloured red, highlighting areas to be interpreted with care. A 5 -fold validation of the model was Monte Carlo simulated 25 times to ensure an adequate model fit. Results The stochastic model was generated using ~ 67, 000 CGM measurements, spread across the glycaemic range ~ 2 - 10 [*]mmol/L. A 5 -fold validation showed a good model fit: the model 80 % confidence interval (CI) captured 83 % of clinical CGM data, the model 90 % CI captured 91 % of clinical CGM data, and the model 99 % CI captured 99 % of clinical CGM data. Three patient examples show the stochastic classification method in use with 1) A stable, low variability patient which shows no unusual CGM measurements, 2) A patient with a very sudden, short hypoglycaemic event (classified as unusual), and, 3) A patient with very high, potentially un-physiological, glycaemic variability after day 3 of monitoring (classified as very unusual). Conclusions This study has produced a stochastic model and classification method capable of highlighting unusual CGM behaviour. This method has the potential to classify important glycaemic events (e. g. hypoglycaemia) as true clinical events or sensor noise, and to help identify possible sensor degradation. Colour coded CGM traces convey the information quickly and efficiently, while remaining computationally light enough to be used retrospectively or in real-time. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is {{a common}} female endocrine disorder of heterogeneous clinical presentation, high disease burden, and unknown aetiology. The disease and associated conditions cluster in families, suggesting that PCOS may be the reproductive consequence of underlying chronic disease susceptibility. Objective: To determine whether parents of young women with PCOS {{were more likely to}} have a history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease in later adult life. Design, Setting and Participants: Structured interviews with 715 members of a <b>cohort</b> constructed by <b>tracing</b> female infants born at a single general hospital in Adelaide between 1973 and 1975. Participants were asked whether they had a pre-existing medical diagnosis of PCOS, and whether each parent had ever had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, stroke, or heart disease. Maternal high blood pressure during pregnancy was taken from the medical record of the pregnancy with the study participant. Results and Conclusions: Mothers of women with PCOS were more likely than mothers of other women to have any cardiovascular disease (RR 1. 78, 95 % CI 1. 29, 2. 47), and nearly twice as likely to have high blood pressure (RR 1. 95, 95 % CI 1. 38, 2. 76).

In this study, we aimed {{to characterize the}} potential need for and use of fertility treatments in a population-based cohort of young Australian women. METHODS: We conducted structured interviews with 974 members of a <b>cohort</b> constructed by <b>tracing</b> all female infants born at a single general hospital in Adelaide between 1973 and 1975. The main outcome measures were pregnancy history, difficulty becoming pregnant and assistance sought to become pregnant. RESULTS: Of 657 women aged 30 - 32 who had sought pregnancy, 24 % reported difficulty becoming pregnant and 26 % had lost at least one pregnancy. Ovulatory problems (16 %) and male fertility problems (13 %) were common among those with difficulty. Over half {{of the women who}} had difficulty conceiving (58 %) sought assistance, largely from specialists (53 %). Consultations, tests and education only were common (22 %), as were IVF/ICSI (17 %). Close to a third (28 %) of those seeking assistance were treated only with clomiphene, as were two-thirds (67 %) of women with ovulatory problems. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, almost a quarter of women in their early 30 s reported difficulty conceiving, and over a quarter reported pregnancy loss. This suggests that a significant proportion of young women experience substantial difficulties becoming pregnant. Our findings highlight the need to continue to document the range of women's reproductive experiences and to monitor fertility and treatment-seeking trends. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dairy {{consumption}} affects biological pathways {{associated with}} carcinogenesis. Evidence for {{a link between}} cancer risk and dairy consumption in adulthood is increasing, but associations with childhood dairy consumption have not been studied adequately. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether dairy consumption in childhood is associated with cancer incidence and mortality in adulthood. DESIGN: From 1937 through 1939, some 4, 999 children living in England and Scotland participated {{in a study of}} family food consumption, assessed from 7 -d household food inventories. The National Health Service central register was used to ascertain cancer registrations and deaths between 1948 and 2005 in the 4, 383 <b>traced</b> <b>cohort</b> members. Per capita household intake estimates for dairy products and calcium were used as proxy for individual intake. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 770 cancer registrations or cancer deaths occurred. High childhood total dairy intake was associated with a near-tripling in the odds of colorectal cancer [multivariate odds ratio: 2. 90 (95 % CI: 1. 26, 6. 65); 2 -sided P for trend = 0. 005] compared with low intake, independent of meat, fruit, and vegetable intakes and socioeconomic indicators. Milk intake showed a similar association with colorectal cancer risk. High milk intake was weakly inversely associated with prostate cancer risk (P for trend = 0. 11). Childhood dairy intake was not associated with breast and stomach cancer risk; a positive association with lung cancer risk was confounded by smoking behavior during adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: A family diet rich in dairy products during childhood is associated with a greater risk of colorectal cancer in adulthood. Confirmation of possible underlying biological mechanisms is needed...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dairy {{consumption}} in childhood may have long-term effects on cardiovascular mortality through influencing {{the development of}} risk factors or programming effects. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether dairy and calcium {{consumption in}} childhood is associated with adult mortality due to coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and all causes. METHODS: In 1937 - 9, 4999 children in England and Scotland participated {{in a study of}} family food consumption, assessed from 7 -day household food inventories. Cause of death was ascertained between 1948 and 2005 in 4374 <b>traced</b> <b>cohort</b> members with complete data. Per capita household intake estimates for dairy products and calcium were used as proxies for individual intake. RESULTS: No strong evidence that a family diet in childhood high in dairy products was associated with CHD or stroke mortality was found. However, childhood calcium intake was inversely associated with stroke mortality (multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for highest versus lowest calcium group: 0. 41; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 16 to 1. 05; p for trend = 0. 04), but not CHD mortality. All-cause mortality was lowest in those with the highest family dairy (HR = 0. 77; 95 % CI 0. 61 to 0. 98; p for trend = 0. 04) and calcium intake (HR = 0. 77, 95 % CI 0. 60 to 0. 98; p for trend = 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Children whose family diet in the 1930 s was high in calcium were at reduced risk of death from stroke. Furthermore, childhood diets rich in dairy or calcium were associated with lower all-cause mortality in adulthood. Replication in other study populations is needed to determine whether residual confounding explains part of these findings...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND In Australia, {{fertility}} {{treatment is}} partly or wholly reimbursable under federal benefits schemes, without restrictions on age, number of treatment cycles or existing family size. In this study, we aimed {{to characterize the}} potential need for and use of fertility treatments in a population-based cohort of young Australian women. METHODS We conducted structured interviews with 974 members of a <b>cohort</b> constructed by <b>tracing</b> all female infants born at a single general hospital in Adelaide between 1973 and 1975. The main outcome measures were pregnancy history, difficulty becoming pregnant and assistance sought to become pregnant. RESULTS Of 657 women aged 30 – 32 who had sought pregnancy, 24 % reported difficulty becoming pregnant and 26 % had lost at least one pregnancy. Ovulatory problems (16 %) and male fertility problems (13 %) were common among those with difficulty. Over half {{of the women who}} had difficulty conceiving (58 %) sought assistance, largely from specialists (53 %). Consultations, tests and education only were common (22 %), as were IVF/ICSI (17 %). Close to a third (28 %) of those seeking assistance were treated only with clomiphene, as were two-thirds (67 %) of women with ovulatory problems. CONCLUSIONS In this study, almost a quarter of women in their early 30 s reported difficulty conceiving, and over a quarter reported pregnancy loss. This suggests that a significant proportion of young women experience substantial difficulties becoming pregnant.

40|$|Extent: 4 p. Background: Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is {{a common}} female endocrine disorder of heterogeneous clinical presentation, high disease burden, and unknown aetiology. The disease and associated conditions cluster in families, suggesting that PCOS may be the reproductive consequence of underlying chronic disease susceptibility. Objective: To determine whether parents of young women with PCOS {{were more likely to}} have a history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease in later adult life. Design, Setting and Participants: Structured interviews with 715 members of a <b>cohort</b> constructed by <b>tracing</b> female infants born at a single general hospital in Adelaide between 1973 and 1975. Participants were asked whether they had a pre-existing medical diagnosis of PCOS, and whether each parent had ever had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, stroke, or heart disease. Maternal high blood pressure during pregnancy was taken from the medical record of the pregnancy with the study participant. Results and Conclusions: Mothers of women with PCOS were more likely than mothers of other women to have any cardiovascular disease (RR 1. 78, 95 % CI 1. 29, 2. 47), and nearly twice as likely to have high blood pressure (RR 1. 95, 95 % CI 1. 38, 2. 76). Fathers of women with PCOS were more than twice as likely to have heart disease (RR 2. 36, 95 % CI 1. 44, 3. 88) and over four times as likely to have had a stroke (RR 4. 37, 95 % CI 1. 97, 9. 70). Occurrence of cardiovascular disease in both mother and father are associated with the risk of PCOS in daughters. Further detailed study is required to elucidate the precise pathways that may be causally related to the observations. Michael J. Davies, Jennifer L. Marino, Kristyn J. Willson, Wendy A.

40|$|The {{availability}} of high-throughput molecular profiling techniques has provided more accurate and informative data for regular clinical studies. Nevertheless, complex computational workflows {{are required to}} interpret these data. Over the past years, the data volume has been growing explosively, requiring robust human data management to organise and integrate the data efficiently. For this reason, we set up an ELIXIR implementation study, together with the Translational research IT (TraIT) programme, to design a data ecosystem that is able to link raw and interpreted data. In this project, {{the data from the}} TraIT Cell Line Use Case (TraIT-CLUC) are used as a test case for this system. Within this ecosystem, we use the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) to store raw molecular profiling data; tranSMART to collect interpreted molecular profiling data and clinical data for corresponding samples; and Galaxy to store, run and manage the computational workflows. We can integrate these data by linking their repositories systematically. To showcase our design, we have structured the TraIT-CLUC data, which contain a variety of molecular profiling data types, for storage in both tranSMART and EGA. The metadata provided allows referencing between tranSMART and EGA, fulfilling the cycle of data submission and discovery; we have also designed a data flow from EGA to Galaxy, enabling reanalysis of the raw data in Galaxy. In this way, users can select patient <b>cohorts</b> in tranSMART, <b>trace</b> them back to the raw data and perform (re) analysis in Galaxy. Our conclusion is that the majority of metadata does not necessarily need to be stored (redundantly) in both databases, but that instead FAIR persistent identifiers should be available for well-defined data ontology levels: study, data access committee, physical sample, data sample and raw data file. This approach will pave the way for the stable linkage and reuse of data...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{prevalence}} of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) according to guidelines of today seems considerably higher {{than has been}} reported also in recent literature. Aim: To estimate the {{prevalence of}} COPD as defined by British Thoracic Society (BTS) criteria and the recent global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) criteria. Further aims were to assess the proportion of underdiagnosis and of symptoms in subjects with COPD, and to study risk factors for COPD. Methods: In 1996, 5892 of the Obstructive Lung Disease in Northern Sweden (OLIN) Study's first <b>cohort</b> could be <b>traced</b> to a third follow-up survey, and 5189 completed responses (88 %) were received corresponding to 79 % of the original cohort from December 1985. Of the responders, a random sample of 1500 subjects were invited to a structured interview and a lung function test, and 1237 of the invited completed a lung function test with acceptable quality. Results: In ages > 45 years, the prevalence of COPD according to the BTS guidelines was 8 %, while it was 14 % according to the GOLD criteria. The absolutely dominating risk factors were increasing age and smoking, and approximately a half of elderly smokers fulfilled the criteria for COPD according to both the BTS and the GOLD criteria. Family history of obstructive airway disease was also a risk factor, while gender was not. Of those fulfilling the BTS criteria for COPD, 94 % were symptomatics, 69 % had chronic productive cough, but only 31 % had prior to the study been diagnosed as having either chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or COPD. The corresponding figures for COPD according GOLD were 88, 51, and 18 %. Conclusions: In ages > 45 years, the prevalence of COPD according to the BTS guidelines was 8 %, and it was 14 % according to the GOLD criteria. Fifty percent of elderly smokers had developed COPD. The large majority of subjects having COPD were symptomatic, while the proportion of those diagnosed as having COPD or similar diagnoses was small...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} birth asphyxia and neurological impairment a cohort of 184 infants with a low (≤ 3) one-minute Apgar score was studied. All were singletons, apparently normally formed, and born at term (≥ 37 weeks' gestation) in the John Radcliffe Hospital, between January 1984 and September 1985. The 181 <b>cohort</b> survivors were <b>traced</b> {{at the age of}} five years; 159 were assessed by a paediatrician on a battery of neurodevelopmental tests, and information about a further eight was obtained from other sources. Three infants in the cohort died neonatally with a diagnosis of birth asphyxia, and three had spastic quadriplegia, profound developmental delay and visual impairment. Examination of the perinatal histories of these six children, including their fetal heart rate patterns in labour and acid-base status at delivery, found convincing evidence of birth asphyxia. Only one other child in the cohort exhibited similar signs of birth asphyxia; he was unimpaired at the age of five. To assess the impact of birth asphyxia on the overall rate of cerebral palsy, all cases of cerebral palsy born to Oxford residents in the study period were identified. Of 30 cases of cerebral palsy, the three identified in the follow-up study were the only ones whose impairment could be attributed to birth asphyxia in a full-term birth. Birth asphyxia therefore accounted for 10 % of all cases of cerebral palsy, a fraction that agrees with previous estimates. The frequency of cerebral palsy due to birth asphyxia was estimated as 1 in 3800 full-term livebirths. A detailed analysis of the test scores of the 159 children assessed by the paediatrician failed to show any association between their acid-base values at delivery and test scores, or between their fetal heart rate patterns in labour and test scores. These results conform with the view that birth asphyxia has an "all or nothing" effect, and that it presents as a cluster of abnormal neonatal signs, including persistent cerebral depression, severe acidaemia, neonatal encephalopathy, and multiorgan dysfunction. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{central theme}} {{of this study is}} that because of the {{changing}} life styles and the macro-events which occurred after World War I these years were a watershed. The women born in the three five-year cohorts from 1910 through 1924 were at different stages of maturity and awareness as particular economic and political events occurred. The social and political climates were different for each of these cohorts of women. Therefore there would be discernible differences in attitudes and opinions among the cohorts. A literature review indicated three models for the formation of social attitudes and political opinions. The 2 ̆ 2 Personality Types 2 ̆ 2 is based on the premise that attitudes formed early in life remain fixed. The 2 ̆ 2 Aging/Conservative 2 ̆ 2 model considers that attitudes become increasingly conservative as the person ages. This study, however, was based on the 2 ̆ 2 Historical Change 2 ̆ 2 model. Beliefs and attitudes may change in response to personal experiences throughout the life course. Four research questions were developed. 1. How have macro-events affected the life experiences of women in these cohorts? 2. How have social pressures affected their experiencing of employment, matrimony, and motherhood? 3. How do the opinions of women in these three cohorts with regard to social and political issues differ and change? 4. Can differences of opinions among the women of the three <b>cohorts</b> be <b>traced</b> to dissimilarities in life experiences? Census data literature was researched to provide background documentation on technological and demographic changes in the United States during the 20 th century. Questions for cohort comparisons were selected from the National Opinion Research Council Surveys of 1972 through 1989. These considered individual and family demographics, labor force participation, social attitudes, and political orientation. For the 2, 814 respondents analysis was done by five-year cohorts to determine differences and by six-year periods to point out trends. Both ANOVA and Chi-square were used to verify statistical significance. Focus group sessions, with 41 participants, met at senior centers and housing units in the Portland metropolitan area. A questionnaire completed by each participant confirmed that the focus group demographics corresponded to those of the national sample. Individual life experience time lines provided material for opening the discussion. Other discussion topics were based on differences noted among the three cohorts in the NORC data analysis. These were in the areas of education, work experience, family life patterns, political orientation, and attitudes toward societal changes. A brief finding for each research question follows. 1. NORC data indicated that each successive cohort held increasingly liberal sociopolitical opinions, and that women of all three cohorts became less conservative over the years. The focus group participants related these changes to specific macro-events in their life experiences. 2. Focus group discussions disclosed that the 1910 - 1914 cohort realized later in life that societal pressure had limited their educational achievement. Women of the 1915 - 19 cohort came to understand that their acceptance of the homemaker role was somewhat based on societal expectations. The 1920 - 24 cohort were aware that discrimination in the work arena was based on societal norms of the time. 3. Analysis of both NORC data and opinions expressed in the focus groups indicated that each successive cohort was increasingly broadminded and tolerant. 4. The women participating in the focus groups exhibited an awareness of the differential effects of life experiences. They specified the effects of macro-events (chiefly the Great Depression), education, mobility, and workforce participation. This research has tentatively confirmed that a generational watershed occurred for women born before World War I and those born after. As the women of the 1910 through 1924 cohorts matured they experienced differing social and political climates. This resulted in cohort differences. Further investigation may reveal more precise cohort boundaries for the 1910 through 1924 years. It should be remembered also that cohort boundaries for men may not coincide with those of women...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiotocography (CTG) is {{the main}} method for intrapartum fetal {{surveillance}} in many countries. The method has a high sensitivity, but a poor specificity, which leads to an increased rate of interventions compared with auscultation. Fetal blood sampling (FBS) was developed parallel to CTG, {{and can be used}} as an adjunct to diagnose or exclude fetal acidemia when the CTG tracing is non-reassuring. Lactate analysis has been shown as reliable as gold standard pH analysis, and FBS with lactate analysis has the advantages of a lower failure rate, shorter time from sampling to analysis result, and lactate concentration identifies the metabolic component of acidemia in contrast to pH. However, since guidelines for CTG interpretation cannot be regarded as fully evidence-based, neither can guidelines for the use of FBS. The aim of this thesis was to further increase the knowledge of FBS and measurements of fetal lactate concentrations as an adjunct in intrapartum fetal surveillance. Materials and Methods: The study population consisted of women with a simplex pregnancy, gestational age ≥ 34 weeks, cephalic presentation and indication for FBS during labor. The cohort in papers I and II were women who had participated in a former RCT at ten obstetric units in Sweden. Study I included all 2992 women randomized to either pH-, or lactate analysis, and Study II included the 1496 women with lactate analysis. The cohort in studies III and IV were all consecutive women with FBS during labor at Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Sweden, during two years. In the 1 st cohort, the 95 th percentile of all lactate values and the 5 th percentile of all pH values were used as the definition of severe intrapartum acidemia and frequencies of adverse neonatal outcome were calculated. The neonates were classified according to birth weight as small/appropriate/large, and medians in lactate concentration at FBS were calculated in the total population and in acidemic cases as well as neonatal outcome according to birth weight groups. In the 2 nd <b>cohort,</b> all CTG <b>traces</b> prior to FBSs were interpreted, and CTG patterns were correlated to acidemia at FBS. Delivery mode and neonatal outcomes were analyzed in relation to number of FBSs during labor, 1 - 2 vs ≥ 3. Results: The risk of serious adverse neonatal outcome was 10 % or less in the high risk groups with severe intrapartum acidemia, and time interval from FBS to delivery was shorter in the pH group. In comparison between birth weight groups, the median lactate concentration at FBS in acidemic fetuses did not differ, nor did the proportion of acidemic fetuses at FBS or neonatal outcome. A CTG tracing with isolated reduced variability did not increase the risk of acidemia at FBS, severe variable decelerations and late decelerations correlated equally to acidemia, and tachycardia with either of those decelerations had the highest prevalence of acidemia. Neonatal outcome did not differ in labors with ≥ 3 FBSs compared with 1 - 2 FBSs, but cesarean delivery rate was 42 % vs 23 %, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2. 0. Conclusions: Acidemia in scalp blood is an early marker of intrapartum fetal hypoxia, and FBS can be used to prevent severe birth acidemia. Lactate might react earlier than pH in the hypoxic process. Small for gestational age fetuses can produce equally amounts of lactate as a response to hypoxia as normally grown fetuses, and FBS with lactate analysis is a reliable surveillance method also for growth restricted fetuses in labor. A CTG tracing with isolated reduced variability does not necessitate repeat FBSs during labor. The two types of serious decelerations correspond equally to fetal acidemia and distinguishing them is not crucial. Monitoring a woman with repeat FBSs during labour is safe for the baby, but doubles the risk for cesarean delivery...|$|R
40|$|The {{elemental}} {{concentration of}} otoliths {{provides an opportunity}} to discriminate among fish living in different habitats, and to estimate population connectivity, life history variation and potential movements. Understanding temporal patterns of recruitment and connectivity of estuarine fish populations, as well as life history variation is fundamental to elucidating population dynamics and informing effective management and conservation efforts. Estuarine associated species utilise sheltered habitats for growth and feeding, but also face fluctuating environmental conditions. Estuaries may be temporally variable sinks or sources of juveniles and have fish moving to other areas. Otolith chemistry provides a tool to reconstruct origins and quantify connectivity between juvenile and adult populations, as well as investigate movements of fish throughout their life history. The overall {{aim of this study}} was to assess connectivity and partial migration within black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) populations in South Australia. The key objectives were to: (1) Determine spatial and temporal variation in otolith elemental signatures to assess their usefulness for determining connectivity of black bream populations; (2) Retrospectively trace subadult fish from the Fleurieu Peninsula (FP) and Kangaroo Island (KI), South Australia, to their juvenile regions to gain an understanding of movements; and (3) Determine the proportion of migrant and resident life history types within estuarine populations and if these different contingents reflect a hybrid fish genotype. I examined spatial and temporal variability in otolith chemistry of juvenile 0 ⁺ black bream to discriminate fish living in different estuaries. Fish were sampled in up to 12 estuaries on KI (7 estuaries) and the FP (5 estuaries) annually over a five year period (2007 – 2011). Otoliths were examined to determine if individual estuaries or groups of estuaries differed in chemical concentrations (signatures or tags), and to examine inter-annual variation in chemical tags. Tags differed among individual estuaries and in some cases adjacent estuaries shared similar chemical tags. Differences in chemical tags were detected among all estuaries in two of the year comparisons. Similarities in otolith tags were detected for five of the seven estuaries in 2010 and 2011. Grouping estuaries with similar chemical tags enhanced the classification accuracy of fish to estuaries and therefore the ability to discriminate stock structure based on otolith chemistry. Temporal differences in chemical tags were detected among years for several estuaries; however, there were no clear trends in the differences between years. The results highlight that black bream from different estuaries or groups of estuaries have unique chemical tags that can be used to <b>trace</b> <b>cohorts</b> of fish. Such differences can be used to estimate connectivity, population movements, and the function of estuaries as nursery areas for this species in subsequent years. Otolith chemistry was then used to reconstruct origins and to quantify connectivity between juvenile and adult components of black bream populations. Trace element composition of juvenile black bream otoliths from broad areas representing estuaries from each of KI and FP were quantified for each of four years (2007 - 2010) and used as baseline data to retrospectively trace the juvenile region of 1 to 3 ⁺ year black bream. Such an approach was possible because there were differences in otolith element concentration of young-of-year black bream among broad areas. Through LA-ICP-MS analysis of the juvenile region of subadult (1 to 3 ⁺ year old) black bream, I was able to estimate the proportion of juvenile fish that recruited from these two regions through time, as well as temporal patterns of connectivity between KI and FP. My results suggest variability among cohorts of the same age, among age classes within a cohort and between regions in terms of self-recruitment. These results highlight the variable nature of connectivity among populations and recruitment to adult populations suggesting that management and conservation efforts may need to consider such variability. Partial migration, where some members of a population migrate showing life history profiles of salinity habitats was evaluated in six estuarine populations of black bream from KI, using otolith Ba:Ca ratios. Profiles of Ba:Ca across otoliths were used to broadly determine fish habitat use (freshwater, estuarine, marine) and assign euryhaline or stenohaline status. In addition, we evaluated whether migratory fish may represent hybrid fish between black bream and yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis) using an eight locus microsatellite library. Partial migration was observed in all six estuarine populations, although for most estuaries there were greater numbers of migratory fish than resident fish. Hybrid fish were found in five of the six estuaries and comprised both migratory and resident fish. Both resident and migratory fish spent most time in marine waters, but migratory fish also moved to estuarine and freshwaters. Similar patterns were also seen for hybrid fish. The data highlight the different migratory behaviours of subadult individuals and show that hybrid bream had reached estuaries previously thought to be inhabited by pure black bream. Complex migratory patterns may allow populations to persist under adverse environmental conditions and in systems subject to change. Otolith chemistry data provided greater insight into patterns of connectivity between broad geographic regions and life history variation of black bream in South Australia. The variable nature of connectivity among populations and recruitment to adult populations suggests that conservation efforts will be more complex than protecting a single region. However, the temporally variable contribution of recruits and broad scale connectivity between juvenile regions suggests that no one region acts as a single ‘source’ of recruits, potentially safeguarding the species against the loss of functional nursery habitats. In the same manner, the ability of black bream populations to possess a suite of movement behaviours (likely in response to different conditions) may be beneficial in a dynamic environment such as an estuary since it allows the persistence of populations when faced with increasing habitat degradation. Overall, these findings infer that the adoption of a flexible life history strategy likely enhances species resilience to fluctuating environmental conditions and potentially adverse impacts.
