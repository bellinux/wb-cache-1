5|$|George MacDonald Fraser's The Flashman Papers novels feature <b>Cardigan</b> as a {{recurring}} villain. In the first instalment, he commands Flashman in the 11th Hussars and transfers him to India after he marries Elspeth {{on the grounds}} that she is the daughter of a tradesman. <b>Cardigan</b> reappears in Flashman at the Charge, where Flashman catches <b>Cardigan</b> trying to seduce Elspeth. Flashman later reluctantly joins <b>Cardigan</b> for the Charge of the Light Brigade. He appears briefly in Flashman in the Great Game, where <b>Cardigan</b> demands Flashman defend Cardigan's reputation against hostile journalists. Flashman not only refuses but pointedly insults <b>Cardigan.</b> His last mention comes in Flashman and the Angel of the Lord, where Flashman observes Cardigan's liaison with Fanny Paget.|$|E

In turn Henry gave the Lordship of <b>Cardigan</b> (as the Normans called Ceredigion), including <b>Cardigan</b> Castle, to Gilbert fitz Richard, Earl of Clare, who imposed a string of castles through the lordship.|$|E

5|$|A pair of <b>Cardigan</b> Welsh Corgis were {{imported}} to the US in 1931, but {{the first}} member of that breed to be registered with the AKC was Blodwen of Robinscroft in 1935. They have never had the draw in the United States given to the Corgis of the Pembroke type. In 1997, some 752 <b>Cardigan</b> Welsh Corgis were registered with the AKC, compared to 8,281 of the Pembrokes.|$|E
5|$|The Pembroke is {{the more}} popular breed of dog, with the <b>Cardigan</b> Welsh Corgi {{appearing}} on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. There are several physical {{differences between the two}} types according to the breed standards: the <b>Cardigan</b> is larger overall, both in weight and in height. Traditionally, the tails were of different shapes, but docking had previously been used. With regards to their health, according to a 2004 survey, they both had similar lifespans, although kidney or urethral conditions are more likely in the Pembrokes. Furthermore, Pembroke Corgis {{were more likely to have}} eye problems than the <b>Cardigan</b> breed. Welsh Corgis have a strong association with Queen Elizabeth II, who has personally owned more than 30 dogs, either Pembrokes or Corgi/Dachshund crosses.|$|E

5|$|There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the <b>Cardigan</b> and the Pembroke, each {{named for}} the county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water {{resistant}} and shed on average twice a year. The body of the <b>Cardigan</b> is slightly longer {{than that of the}} Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground. But they are not as square in outline as a typical Terrier, or have an elongated body as great as that of a Dachshund. There are only minor differences {{in the shape of the}} head, both appear fox-like. The head of a <b>Cardigan</b> Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose. It can take a few days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's coat to appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.|$|E
5|$|Barmouth Bridge (Welsh: Pont Abermaw), {{also known}} as Barmouth Viaduct, is a {{single-track}} largely wooden railway viaduct that carries the Cambrian Coast Railway across the River Mawddach estuary {{on the coast of}} <b>Cardigan</b> Bay, Wales. It sits between Morfa Mawddach and Barmouth in Gwynedd and caters for rail, foot and cycle traffic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cardigan</b> {{was one of}} {{the major}} ports of {{southern}} Wales until its harbour silted in the mid-19th century. The Industrial Revolution passed by, not much affecting the area. In the uplands, wheeled vehicles were rare in the 18th century, and horses and sleds were still being used for transport. On the coast, trade in herrings and corn took place across the Irish Sea. In the 19th century, many of the rural poor emigrated to the New World from <b>Cardigan,</b> between five and six thousand leaving the town between 1790 and 1860. Aberystwyth became the main centre for the export of lead and Aberaeron and Newquay did brisk coastal trade. The building of the railway from Shrewsbury in the 1860s encouraged visitors and hotels sprang up in the town to accommodate them.|$|E

5|$|His {{most notorious}} exploit {{took place during}} the Crimean War on 25 October 1854 when, in command of the Light Cavalry Brigade at the battle of Balaclava, he led the Charge of the Light Brigade {{reaching}} the Russian guns before returning, personally unscathed, in a manoeuvre that cost the lives of about 107 out of the 674 men under his command {{who took part in the}} charge (although others may have died of wounds later on). The extent to which Lord <b>Cardigan</b> was to blame is unproven, since he attacked only after expressing his doubts and receiving a direct order in front of the troops from his immediate superior Lord Lucan, Commander of the Cavalry Division. The two men were barely on speaking terms as Lucan was married to one of Cardigan's sisters and, as <b>Cardigan</b> believed, did not treat her well. The order had been conveyed by Captain Louis Nolan, who died in the charge, and both Lucan and <b>Cardigan</b> blamed him for passing on the order incorrectly. Cardigan's first action on his return from the charge was to report the undisciplined behaviour of Captain Nolan (whom he did not know to be dead) in riding ahead of him at the start of the attack.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th century, Ceredigion had more {{industry}} {{than it does}} today; <b>Cardigan</b> was the commercial centre of the county; lead, silver and zinc were mined and <b>Cardigan</b> was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour. The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market. During the last century, livestock farming has become less profitable, and the population of Cardiganshire has been in decline as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated to other countries. More recently, the population has started rising again as elderly people move into the county for retirement, and various government and European Union initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1854, citing ill-health, <b>Cardigan</b> {{set off for}} England.

5|$|Rhys built {{a number}} of stone castles, {{starting}} with <b>Cardigan</b> castle, which was the earliest recorded native-built stone castle in Wales. He also built Carreg Cennen castle near Llandeilo, a castle set in a spectacular position on a mountain top. He held a festival of poetry and song at his court at <b>Cardigan</b> over Christmas 1176. This is generally regarded as the first recorded Eisteddfod. The festival was announced a year in advance throughout Wales and in England, Scotland, Ireland and possibly France. Two chairs were awarded as prizes, one for the best poem {{and the other for}} the best musical performance. J. E. Caerwyn Williams suggests that this event may be an adaptation of the similar French puys. R.R. Davies suggests that the texts of Welsh law, traditionally codified by Hywel Dda at Whitland, were first assembled in book form under the aegis of Rhys.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cardigan</b> Welsh Corgi {{has been}} {{attributed}} to the influences of Nordic settlers in the region. Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the Swedish Vallhund, and it is claimed by some historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor. Farmers in Cardiganshire began to switch from cattle to sheep in the late 19th century, but the existing breed was unsuited to working the sheep flocks. The dog began to be crossed with the Welsh Sheepdog, and this {{is the source of the}} merle colour pattern in the breed. The subsequent similarities between the two types of Welsh corgis have {{been attributed to}} cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from farmers who wished to have the <b>Cardigan</b> variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke breed.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh lowland zone {{consists}} of the north coastal plain, the island of Anglesey, part of the Llŷn Peninsula, a narrow strip of coast along <b>Cardigan</b> Bay, much of Pembrokeshire and southern Carmarthenshire, the Gower Peninsula and the Vale of Glamorgan. The main rivers are the River Dee, part of which forms the boundary between Wales and England, the River Clwyd and the River Conwy, which all flow northwards into Liverpool Bay and the Irish Sea. Further round the coast, the Rivers Mawddach, Dovey, Rheidol, Ystwyth and Teifi flow westwards into <b>Cardigan</b> Bay, and the rivers Towy, Taff, Usk and Wye flow southwards into the Bristol Channel. Parts of the River Severn form the boundary between Wales and England.|$|E
