40|$|The textile {{excavations}} founded at {{the time}} of dig process are called archaeological textiles.

The comparison of various wool fibres in FTIR spectra showed the possibility of distinguishing some animal breed wool fibres and even fibres colours (the difference in natural white and black wool fibre’s spectra was obvious). Investigations of archaeological textile of 13 – 14 century, which with the naked eye looked brown-black colour, showed that one of the textile was woven from white colour of the sheep wool fibre. The investigations of archaeological cellulose fibre textiles showed a lot of discrepancies.
