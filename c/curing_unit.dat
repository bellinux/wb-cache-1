40|$|Aims/Objectives : This {{in vitro}} study was {{designed}} to measure and compare the temperature rise in the pulp chamber with different light <b>curing</b> <b>units.</b> Materials and Methods : The study was done in two settings- in-vitro and in-vivo simulation. In in-vitro setting, 3 mm and 6 mm acrylic spacers with 4 mm tip diameter thermocouple was used and six groups were formed according to the light curing source- 3 Quartz-Tungsten-Halogen (QTH) units and 3 Light-Emitting-Diode (LED) units. For the LED units, three modes of curing like pulse-cure mode, fast mode and ramp mode were used. For in-vivo simulation, 12 caries free human third molar tooth with fused root were used. K-type thermocouple with 1 mm tip diameter was used. Occlusal cavity was prepared, etched, rinsed with water and blot dried; bonding agent was applied and incremental curing of composite was done. Thermal emission for each light curing agent was noted. Results : Temperature rise was very minimal in LED light <b>cure</b> <b>units</b> than in QTH light <b>cure</b> <b>units</b> in both the settings. Temperature rise was minimal at 6 mm distance when compared to 3 mm distance. Among the various modes, fast mode produces the less temperature rise.

To test the hypothesis that routine use of dental <b>curing</b> <b>units</b> may lead to problems with colour discrimination in clinicians, namely orthodontists, when compared with a non- dental control. A self administered questionnaire was designed to assess the profile of orthodontists and the procedures used for light curing. This was completed by 104 orthodontists. The maximum permissible daily exposure times of a variety of curing lights (8 LED, 2 Quartz Tungsten Halogen, and 1 plasma) were calculated at distances of 2 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm, 5 Ocm and 60 using a spectroradiometer. A phantom head unit with acrylic teeth was used to assess the effect of different bracket materials (metal and aesthetic) on reflected light and the maximum daily exposure limits. The Farnsworth Munsell l 00 hue test was used to assess the colour discrimination and deficiency of 15 orthodontists and 15 controls.

The dentin layer, which had the dominant effect on power density reduction, was decreased in thickness from 0. 5 to 0. 1 mm while thickness of the enamel layer was kept unchanged at 0. 5 mm and thickness of the translucent layer was increased from 0. 5 to 0. 9 mm and vice versa, in order to maintain the total thickness of 1. 5 mm of the resin inlay. Power density of various light <b>curing</b> <b>units</b> through resin inlays was measured.

Adhesive films were prepared and cured with SmartLite IQ (Dentsply) or L. E. Demetron I (Demetron Kerr) up to complete curing. Polymerization kinetic curves of the tested adhesives were obtained with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In particular, total reaction time and extent of polymerization (Ep) at 20, 40 or 60 s were compared.

Finally, a high-output halogen lamp (Optilux 501) was used for 40 seconds to bond the final group, which served as a positive control. All teeth were fixed in hard acrylic and stored for 24 hours in water at 37 degrees C. Shear bond strength (SBS) was measured using an Instron testing machine. Weibull distribution and analysis of variance were used to test for significant differences. The SBS values obtained were significantly different between groups (P < 0. 001). When used for 10 seconds, the intensive LED <b>curing</b> <b>units</b> achieved sufficient SBS, comparable with the control. In contrast, 5 seconds resulted in significantly lower SBS. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) was not significantly affected.

30|$|Modulation of the {{luminous}} energy {{has been shown}} to be efficient in decreasing the shrinkage stress of dental composite polymerization, but its clinical use is difficult, because it increases the clinical time and is dependent on the irradiance of the light <b>curing</b> <b>unit,</b> which the dentist does not usually know. Moreover, these methods can reduce the stress, but they do not reduce the final shrinkage of the material [3 – 6].|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{aim of this}} {{in-vitro}} {{study was}} to assess the thermal effect of light emitting diode (LED) light <b>curing</b> <b>unit</b> on the enamel etching time. Materials and Methods: Three treatment groups with 15 enamel specimens each were used in this study: G 1 : Fifteen seconds of etching, G 2 : Five seconds of etching, G 3 : Five seconds of etching plus LED light irradiation (simultaneously). The micro shear bond strength (µSBS) of composite resin to enamel was measured. Results: The mean µSBS values ± standard deviation were 51. 28 ± 2. 35, 40. 47 ± 2. 75 and 50. 00 ± 2. 59 MPa in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. There was a significant difference between groups 1 and 2 (P= 0. 013) and between groups 2 and 3 (P= 0. 032) in this respect, while {{there was no difference between}} groups 1 and 3 (P= 0. 932). Conclusion: Simultaneous application of phosphoric acid gel over enamel surface and light irradiation using a LED light <b>curing</b> <b>unit</b> decreased enamel etching time to five seconds without compromising the µSBS. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} quantitatively {{evaluated the}} marginal adaptation of pit and fissure sealants. The occlusal surfaces of 48 intact, caries-free human molars were cleaned with an air-abrasion unit. The teeth were then randomly divided into eight groups of six teeth each {{according to the}} type of enamel conditioning, sealant material applied and <b>curing</b> <b>unit</b> used. After applying either 40 % phosphoric acid gel (K-etch, Kuraray Co) or a self-etching primer adhesive system (Clearfil SE Bond, Kuraray Co), sealant materials of two viscosities were applied (Teethmate F- 1 and Protect-Liner-F, Kuraray Co) and cured with halogen (Optilux 500, Demetron) or plasma arc (Apollo- 95 E, Dental & Medical Diagnostic Systems, Ltd) curing units. The marginal adaptation of the pit and fissure sealant restorations was evaluated by using a computer-assisted quantitative margin analysis in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) on epoxy replicas before and after thermal and mechanical stressing of the teeth. The results were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a confidence level of 95 % (p= 0. 05). A post-hoc Tukey HSD-test was used for multiple pairwise comparisons between groups. The null hypothesis was that there was no statistically significant difference between the groups that were tested in this study. The statistically significant differences between groups were more pronounced after loading. In most cases, the self-etching adhesive system (SE Bond) proved as effective as phosphoric acid etching (K-etch). The low viscosity sealant material (Teethmate F- 1), in most cases, exhibited better marginal adaptation than the high viscosity material (Protect-Liner F). The high viscosity material performed equally well only when used in combination with the self-etching primer adhesive system as an intermediate layer. The halogen <b>curing</b> <b>unit</b> (Optilux 500) led to better marginal adaptation than the plasma arc <b>curing</b> <b>unit</b> (Apollo 95 E), especially after thermal and mechanical stressing...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The aim of {{the present}} in vitro study was to {{establish}} the minimum necessary curing time to bond stainless steel brackets (Mini Diamond TwinTM) using new, intensive, light-emitting diode (LED) <b>curing</b> <b>units.</b> Seventy-fi ve bovine primary incisors were divided into fi ve equal groups. A standard light curing adhesive (TransbondTM XT) was used to bond the stainless steel brackets using different lamps and curing times. Two groups were bonded using an intensive LED curing lamp (OrtholuxTM LED) for 5 and 10 seconds. Two more groups were bonded using another intensive LED curing device (Ultra-LumeTM LED 5) also for 5 and 10 seconds. Finally, a high-output halogen lamp (OptiluxTM 501) was used for 40 seconds to bond the fi nal group, which served as a positive control. All teeth were fi xed in hard acrylic and stored for 24 hours in water at 37 °C. Shear bond strength (SBS) was measured using an Instron testing machine.

40|$|Nanofilled resin {{composites}} {{are recognized}} {{to combine the}} good mechanical strength of the hybrids and the best polish of the microfills. One of the mechanical properties {{that should be considered}} is compressive strength due to masticatory force on restoration. A resin composite is composed by organic polymer matrix, inorganic filler, coupling agent, and the initiator-accelerator system.
