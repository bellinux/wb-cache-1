Pot experiments {{were performed to}} study the effect <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> application on growth, physiology and accumulation of heavy metals in three kinds of wheat. The experimental results showed soil pH decreased significantly {{with the increase of}} the application <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge.</b> The contents <b>of</b> Cu, Zn and Pb in the mixed soil did not exceed the Environmental quality standards for soils in China for Grade II (GB- 1518 - 1995). Wheat obtained good growth activities after the application <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge,</b> however, high land application <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> (the ratio <b>of</b> sludge in the mixed soil of dry weight was 20 % and 25 %) inhibited seed emergence and root length. The content of total chlorophyll in wheat increased with the increase <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> application first and reached a maximum, and then decreased with a further increase <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge.</b> Compared with the control, the a/b value in chlorophyll showed trace change. The content of proline in wheat increased with the increase <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> in low doses <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> (5 %, 10 % and 15 %), while there was no significant increase in the content in high land application <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge.</b> The physiological metabolism of wheat will exhibit abnormality as the stress of pollutants from sludge exceeded the tolerance of wheat.

Operation <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> disposal is usually expensive and/or easy to contaminate the environment. In China, most <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> {{has not been}} treated and disposed of properly, resulting in environmental pollution and potential exposure to humans. In the near future, <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> production in China will increase rapidly together with the dramatic increase of municipal wastewater treatment ratio (treated/produced), implying that the problem <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> disposal will become more serious and unavoidable.

Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the pyrolysis process <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> consisted <b>of</b> three main steps in the respective temperature zones of 600 °C.

Langaroud soil had the highest and Isfahan soil the lowest levels of DTPA-extractable metals. Application <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> increased plant growth and metals in the foliage of corn plants. The metal concentration in corn tissues also increased with decreasing soil pH. Overall, the application <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> as an organic material, particularly in acid soils, may increase availability of heavy metals, which may, in turn, result in soil pollution. Therefore, addition <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> to soils should be managed on the basis of the changes in soil heavy metal concentration...|$|R

40|$|Up to now, {{economic}} literature {{regarding the}} product safety has studied foreseeable risks {{that are known}} by producers. However, the literature has not analysed which liability rule and insurance schemes are efficient for radical uncertainty. This paper addresses this topic through insurance schemes in France and Germany for <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> spreading. Section 1 gives an overview of economic literature regarding product safety and liability, and stresses the lack of research on radical uncertainty. Section 2 examines {{the content of the}} French and German guarantee funds. Both funds have been constituted by a contribution <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> producers. Section 3 examines to what extent the strict liability rule is efficient. If radical uncertainty has been dealt with a contribution <b>of</b> each <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> producer, compensation is however limited. Moreover, strategic uncertainty (food industry bans <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge)</b> and different levels <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> quality are not considered by these funds. sewage sludge; guarantee funds; radical uncertainty; development risk; France; Germany; product safety; liability; insurance; environmental protection; voluntary approach. ...|$|R

40|$|After {{entrance}} to EU in 2004, the management <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> {{has become more}} and more important problem for the new members. In Poland, {{one of the most promising}} technologies is composting process <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> with carbonaceous materials. However, the high price of typically used cereal straw forces the specialists to look for new and cheap materials used as donor of carbon and substrates creating good, porous structure of composted heap. This work presents the results <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> composting mixed with sawdust and maize straw used to create structure favorable for air exchange. The results show dynamic thermophilic phase of composting process in all cases where maize straw was used...|$|R
40|$|The current {{situation}} on the quantities and disposal methods <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> in European Union is discussed, together with the trends up to 2005 and the future sludge disposal possibilities. The problems relating to the methods currently used in Greece and the requirement for land suitable for the safe agricultural application <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> are evaluated. This concept {{will be important to}} the decisionmakers for the purpose of the disposal <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> in the future. Soil measurements in lands used for sludge disposal in western and southern Greece show that some soils have been already polluted by heavy metals and should be abandoned while others need careful monitoring until their saturation...|$|R

40|$|Study on {{effective}} disposal {{and utilization}} <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> {{has recently been}} the target of growing interest in China. However, potential risks are {{associated with the use of}} sludge due to its contamination with toxic organics, heavy metals and pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, a screening assessment was conducted on <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> samples collected from 17 different sewage treatment plants in Beijing, based on a batch of in vitro bioassays, including a set of recombinant gene yeast assays for endocrine disruption, and an ethoxy resorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay using H 4 IIE cells for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ah-R) agonistic activities. Our results suggested that moderate levels of estrogen receptor agonistic activities (0. 9 ng E 2. g(- 1) to 6. 8 ng E 2. g(- 1), dw), but relative higher androgen receptor antagonistic activities (nd to 45 %), progestin receptor antagonistic activities (nd to 80 %) and Ah-R agonistic activities (1390 to 6740 pg 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). g(- 1), dw) were found in <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> samples. However, there were no significant correlations between the toxic effects <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> and the <b>sewage</b> treatment processes. In addition, the 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) equivalent quantity (EEQ) level <b>of</b> the <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> was increased after the composting treatment, whereas the 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) level <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> composted was much lower than that <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge...</b>|$|R
