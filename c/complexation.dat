5|$|Calculations for {{solution}} chemistry {{indicate that}} again, the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, {{will be more}} stable than that of niobium and tantalum, and the +3 state will be less stable than those of niobium and tantalum. The propensity towards hydrolysis of cations in the highest oxidation state {{is expected to continue}} to decrease within group 5; however, it is still expected to be quite rapid. <b>Complexation</b> of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have been conducted; they show reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.|$|E
5|$|High thorium {{concentrations}} {{are needed}} in nuclear applications; particularly, concentrations of atoms with high neutron capture cross-sections must be very low (for example, gadolinium concentrations must be lower than one part per million by weight). Previously, repeated dissolution and recrystallisation was used to achieve high purity. Today, liquid solvent extraction procedures involving selective <b>complexation</b> of Th4+ is used. For example, following alkaline digestion {{and the removal of}} phosphate, the resulting nitrato complexes of thorium, uranium, and the rare earths can be separated by extraction with tributyl phosphate in kerosene.|$|E
5|$|Cerium(IV) aqueous {{solutions}} may {{be prepared}} by reacting cerium(III) solutions {{with the strong}} oxidising agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of <b>complexation</b> and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34V. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state. Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong oxidising agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. For example, ceric ammonium nitrate is a common oxidising agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyse the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene {{undergoes}} oxidation by palladium to give acetaldehyde. This conversion {{remains a}} major industrial process (10M kg/y). The process proceeds via the initial <b>complexation</b> of ethylene to a Pd(II) center.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{stability}} of their <b>complexation</b> with iron, ferrocyanides (Sodium ferrocyanide E535, Potassium ferrocyanide E536, and Calcium ferrocyanide E538) do not decompose to lethal levels {{in the human body}} and are used in the food industry as, e.g., an anticaking agent in table salt.|$|E
25|$|In <b>complexation</b> reactions, several ligands {{react with}} a metal atom to form a {{coordination}} complex. This is achieved by providing lone pairs of the ligand into empty orbitals of the metal atom and forming dipolar bonds. The ligands are Lewis bases, they can be both ions and neutral molecules, such as carbon monoxide, ammonia or water. The number of ligands that react with a central metal atom can be found using the 18-electron rule, saying that the valence shells of a transition metal will collectively accommodate 18 electrons, whereas the symmetry of the resulting complex can be predicted with the crystal field theory and ligand field theory. <b>Complexation</b> reactions also include ligand exchange, in which one or more ligands are replaced by another, and redox processes which change the oxidation state of the central metal atom.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} remove or recover the {{extracted}} solute, SIR particles can be regenerated using low pressure steam stripping, which is particularly effective for {{the recovery of}} volatile hydrocarbons. However, if the vapor pressure of the extracted solute is too low, or if the <b>complexation</b> between solute and extractant is too strong, other techniques need to be applied, e.g. pH swing.|$|E
25|$|Later, Corey {{demonstrated}} that substituted boranes were easier {{to prepare and}} much more stable. The reduction mechanism begins with the oxazoborolidine being only slightly basic at , coordinating with the stoichiometric borane of the boron amine complex(scheme 10). Lack of donation from the nitrogen to the boron increases its Lewis acidity, allowing coordination with the ketone substrate. The <b>complexation</b> of the substrate occurs from the most accessible lone pair of the oxygen leading to restricted rotation around the B-O bond due to the sterically neighboring phenyl group.|$|E
25|$|Figure 1 to {{the right}} {{explains}} the basic principle, in which the organic extractant E is contained inside the pores of a porous particle. The solute S, which is initially dissolved in the aqueous phase surrounding the SIR particle, physically dissolves in the organic extractant phase during the extraction process. Furthermore, the solute S can react with the extractant to form a complex ES. This <b>complexation</b> of the solute with the extractant shifts the overall extraction equilibrium further towards the organic phase. This way, the extraction of the solute is enhanced.|$|E
25|$|The {{trivalent}} lanthanides mostly form ionic salts. The trivalent ions {{are hard}} acceptors and form more stable complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands. The larger ions are 9-coordinate in aqueous solution, 3+ but the smaller ions are 8-coordinate, 3+. There {{is some evidence}} that the later lanthanides have more water molecules in the second coordination sphere. <b>Complexation</b> with monodentate ligands is generally weak because it is difficult to displace water molecules from the first coordination sphere. Stronger complexes are formed with chelating ligands because of the chelate effect, such as the tetra-anion derived from 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA).|$|E
25|$|Some calixarenes are {{efficient}} sodium ionophores and {{are potentially}} useful in chemical sensors. Calixarenes {{are used in}} commercial applications as sodium selective electrodes for the measurement of sodium levels in blood.

Derivatives or homologues of calixarene exhibit highly selective binding behavior towards anions (especially halogen anions) with changes in optical properties such as fluorescence.|$|E
25|$|Radium forms {{much the}} same {{insoluble}} salts as its lighter congener barium: it forms the insoluble sulfate (RaSO4, the most insoluble known sulfate), chromate (RaCrO4), carbonate (RaCO3), iodate (Ra(IO3)2), tetrafluoroberyllate (RaBeF4), and nitrate (Ra(NO3)2). With {{the exception of the}} carbonate, all of these are less soluble in water than the corresponding barium salts, but they are all isostructural to their barium counterparts. Additionally, radium phosphate, oxalate, and sulfite are probably also insoluble, as they coprecipitate with the corresponding insoluble barium salts. The great insolubility of radium sulfate (at 20°C, only 2.1mg will dissolve in 1kg of water) means that {{it is one of the}} less biologically dangerous radium compounds. The large ionic radius of Ra2+ (148pm) results in weak <b>complexation</b> and poor extraction of radium from aqueous solutions when not at high pH.|$|E
25|$|Facilitating drug {{absorption}} {{by increasing}} its {{solubility in water}} is a common pharmaceutical strategy and also {{has been shown to}} be successful for CoQ10. Various approaches have been developed to achieve this goal, with many of them producing significantly better results over oil-based softgel capsules in spite of the many attempts to optimize their composition. Examples of such approaches are use of the aqueous dispersion of solid CoQ10 with the polymer tyloxapol, formulations based on various solubilising agents, such as hydrogenated lecithin, and <b>complexation</b> with cyclodextrins; among the latter, the complex with β-cyclodextrin has been found to have highly increased bioavailability. |journal=Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=281–287 |year=2008 |pmid=18645245 |doi=10.1159/000129661}}-β-Cyclodextrin Complex |journal=Integrative Medicine |volume=9 |issue=1}} and also is used in pharmaceutical and food industries for CoQ10-fortification. Also some other novel carrier systems, such as liposomes, nanoparticles or dendrimers, may be used to increase the bioavailability of CoQ10.|$|E
25|$|Pyridine {{might also}} have minor neurotoxic, genotoxic, and clastogenic effects. Exposure to {{pyridine}} would normally lead to its inhalation and absorption in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, where it either remains unchanged or is metabolized. The major products of pyridine metabolism are N-methylpyridiniumhydroxide, which are formed by N-methyltransferases (e.g., pyridine N-methyltransferase), as well as pyridine N-oxide, and 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxypyridine, which are generated {{by the action of}} monooxygenase. In humans, pyridine is metabolized only into N-methylpyridiniumhydroxide. Pyridine is readily degraded by bacteria to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The unsubstituted pyridine ring degrades more rapidly than picoline, lutidine, chloropyridine, or aminopyridines, and a number of pyridine degraders have been shown to overproduce riboflavin in the presence of pyridine. Ionizable N-heterocyclic compounds, including pyridine, interact with environmental surfaces (such as soils and sediments) via multiple pH-dependent mechanisms, including partitioning to soil organic matter, cation exchange, and surface <b>complexation.</b> Such adsorption to surfaces reduces bioavailability of pyridines for microbial degraders and other organisms, thus slowing degradation rates and reducing ecotoxicity.|$|E
500|$|Unlike its lighter neighbors, cadmium and zinc, mercury usually forms simple stable {{compounds}} with metal-metal bonds. Most mercury(I) compounds are diamagnetic {{and feature}} the dimeric cation, Hg. Stable derivatives include the chloride and nitrate. Treatment of Hg(I) compounds <b>complexation</b> with strong ligands such as sulfide, cyanide, etc. induces disproportionation to [...] and elemental mercury. Mercury(I) chloride, a colorless solid {{also known as}} calomel, is really the compound with the formula Hg2Cl2, with the connectivity Cl-Hg-Hg-Cl. It is a standard in electrochemistry. It reacts with chlorine to give mercuric chloride, which resists further oxidation. Mercury(I) hydride, a colorless gas, has the [...] formula HgH, containing no Hg-Hg bond.|$|E
500|$|Stable carbenes {{are very}} reactive, {{and so the}} minimum amount of {{handling}} is desirable using air-free techniques. However, provided rigorously dry, relatively non-acidic and air-free materials are used, stable carbenes are reasonably robust to handling per se. By way of example, a stable carbene prepared from potassium hydride can be filtered through a dry celite pad to remove excess KH (and resulting salts) from the reaction. On a relatively small scale, a suspension containing a stable carbene in solution can be allowed to settle and the supernatant solution pushed through a dried membrane syringe filter. Stable carbenes are readily soluble in non-polar solvents such as hexane, and so typically recrystallisation of stable carbenes can be difficult, due to the unavailability of suitable non-acidic polar solvents. Air-free sublimation as shown right {{can be an effective}} method of purification, although temperatures below 60°C under high vacuum are preferable as these carbenes are relatively volatile and also could begin to decompose at these higher temperatures. Indeed, sublimation in some cases can give single crystals suitable for X-ray analysis. However, strong <b>complexation</b> to metal ions like lithium will in most cases prevent sublimation.|$|E
