In 1948, with Jean Kérisel (1908–2005), his son-in-law and disciple, he developed an advanced theory extremely important for passive earth pressure (LINK) where there is soil-wall friction. This principle has been broadly applied ever since {{for the design of}} ground engineering structures such as retaining walls, tunnels and foundation piles.|$|E

2500|$|In a September 1904 lecture in St. Louis named , Poincaré drew some {{consequences}} from Lorentz's {{theory and}} defined (in modification of Galileo's Relativity Principle and Lorentz's Theorem of <b>Corresponding</b> <b>States)</b> the following principle: [...] "The Principle of Relativity, {{according to which}} the laws of physical phenomena must {{be the same for}} a stationary observer as for one carried along in a uniform motion of translation, so that we have no means, and can have none, of determining whether or not we are being carried along in such a motion." [...] He also specified his clock synchronization method and explained the possibility of a [...] "new method" [...] or [...] "new mechanics", in which no velocity can surpass that of light for all observers. However, he critically noted that the Relativity Principle, Newton's action and reaction, the conservation of mass, and the conservation of energy are not fully established and are even threatened by some experiments.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} part of the theorem of <b>corresponding</b> <b>states</b> in 1892 and 1895 [...] was the local time , where t is the time coordinate for an observer resting in the ether, and t is the time coordinate for an observer moving in the ether. (Woldemar Voigt had previously used the same expression for local time in 1887 in connection with the Doppler effect and an incompressible medium.) With the help of this concept Lorentz could explain the aberration of light, the Doppler effect and the Fizeau experiment (i.e. measurements of the Fresnel drag coefficient) by Hippolyte Fizeau in moving and also resting liquids. While for Lorentz length contraction was a real physical effect, he considered the time transformation only as a heuristic working hypothesis and a mathematical stipulation to simplify the calculation from the resting to a [...] "fictitious" [...] moving system. Contrary to Lorentz, Poincaré saw more than a mathematical trick in the definition of local time, which he called Lorentz's [...] "most ingenious idea". In [...] he wrote in 1898: ...|$|E

50|$|According to van der Waals, the theorem of <b>corresponding</b> <b>states</b> (or {{principle}} of <b>corresponding</b> <b>states)</b> indicates that all fluids, when compared {{at the same}} reduced temperature and reduced pressure, have approximately the same compressibility factor and all deviate from ideal gas behavior to about the same degree.|$|E
