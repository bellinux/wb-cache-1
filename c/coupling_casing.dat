40|$|AbstractIn the Changning–Weiyuan {{national}} {{shale gas}} demonstration area, SW Sichuan Basin, the wellbore integrity damage occurs in some shale gas wells and has {{direct effect on}} the gas production rate of single shale gas horizontal well. After statistics analysis {{was performed on the}} problems related with wellbore integrity, such as casing damage, casing running difficulty and cement sheath blow-by, the multi-factor <b>coupling</b> <b>casing</b> stress calculation and evaluation mode laws established. Then study was conducted on the influential mechanism of multi-factor coupling (temperature effect, casing bending and axial pressure) on casing damage. The shale slip mechanism and its relationship with casing sheared formation were analyzed by using the Mohr–Coulomb criterion. Inversion analysis was performed on the main controlling factors of casing friction by using the developed casing hook load prediction and friction analysis software. And finally, based on the characteristics of shale gas horizontal wells, wellbore integrity control measures were proposed in terms of design and construction process, so as to improve the drilling quality (DQ). More specifically, shale gas well casing design calculation method and check standard were modified, well structure and full bore hole trajectory design were optimized, drilling quality was improved, cement properties were optimized and cement sealing integrity during fracturing process was checked. These research findings are significant in the design and management of future shale gas borehole integrity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{simulation}} {{study of}} the channel capacity of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna system exploiting multiple polarizations is carried out. We focus on a simple yet realistic trimonopole antenna structure, taking into account all the mutual <b>coupling</b> and <b>casing</b> effects using the computational electromagnetics solver—numerical electromagnetics code. Simulation results show that, with a special transmit geometry, using the collocated trimonopole antennas at a size-constrained receiver can offer channel capacity that approaches the capacity of an uncorrelated MIMO Rayleigh channel. In addition, it is shown that the capacity increase is mainly attributed to polarization diversity instead of pattern diversity. Furthermore, {{we find that the}} mutual <b>coupling</b> and <b>casing</b> effects in the trimonopole system can actually provide a large capacity increase with less constraint on the antenna configurations than the idealized tridipole system. Index Terms—Channel capacity, fading correlation, multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) systems, multiple polarizations. I...|$|R
40|$|Casing {{coupling}} location signals {{provided by}} the magnetic localizer in retractors are typically used to ascertain the position of casing couplings in horizontal wells. However, the <b>casing</b> <b>coupling</b> location signal is usually submerged in noise, which {{will result in the}} failure of <b>casing</b> <b>coupling</b> detection under the harsh logging environment conditions. The limitation of Shannon wavelet time entropy, in the feature extraction of casing status, is presented by analyzing its application mechanism, and a corresponding improved algorithm is subsequently proposed. On the basis of wavelet transform, two derivative algorithms, singular values decomposition and Tsallis entropy theory, are proposed and their physics meanings are researched. Meanwhile, a novel data mining approach to extract casing status features with Tsallis wavelet singularity entropy is put forward in this paper. The theoretical analysis and experiment results indicate that the proposed approach can not only extract the <b>casing</b> <b>coupling</b> features accurately, but also identify the characteristics of perforation and local corrosion in casings. The innovation of the paper is in the use of simple wavelet entropy algorithms to extract the complex nonlinear logging signal features of a horizontal well tractor...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 1 Good rotordynamic behavior, {{implying}} sufficient {{stability margin}} and low sensitivity to unbalance forces, is mandatory for modern high pressure multistage pumps. Stiffness, damping and mass matrices describing the forces {{acting on a}} rotor at bearings, seals, balancing device and impeller is discussed. Comparisons are made between calculated natural frequencies from coupled damped models and ?wet critical speeds? calculated from undamped uncoupled models. The effect of design changes on the stability limit at increased clearances is shown experimentally, and a simplified mathematical model is presented, showing {{the effect of the}} various coefficients on the stability limit. Finally, results are shown from experiments and calculations on <b>coupled</b> rotor <b>casing</b> pedestal systems...|$|R
40|$|A newly {{developed}} global dynamic model {{was used to}} simulate the dynamics of a gear noise rig at NASA Lewis Research Center. Experimental results from the test rig were used to verify the analytical model. In this global dynamic model, the number of degrees of freedom of the system are reduced by transforming the system equations of motion into modal coordinates. The vibration of the individual gear-shaft system are coupled through the gear mesh forces. A three-dimensional, axial-lateral coupled, bearing model was used to <b>couple</b> the <b>casing</b> structural vibration to the gear-rotor dynamics. The coupled system of modal equations is solved to predict the resulting vibration at several locations on the test rig. Experimental vibration data was compared to the predicitions of the global dynamic model. There is excellent agreement between the vibration results from analysis and experiment...|$|R
40|$|Case StudyThis is a {{case study}} of a new steam turbine {{installation}} in which pipe strain became an issue after commissioning and start-up. This case study will bring light to the use of shaft indicator movement vs. turbine casing foot movement for pipe strain verification. The turbine?s bearing housings and process casing are independent of each other. With this type of arrangement, pipe strain would have to be at the extreme to see movement at the <b>coupling.</b> Instead, the <b>casing</b> foot movement should have been monitored. This case study will present the initial as-built conditions vs. the after 6 months of service pipe strain findings and resolution...|$|R
40|$|The present work aims at {{studying}} contact phenomena within aircraft engines. These events {{occur for}} instance when severe manoeuvrings are operated {{or when the}} engine bears a blade-off event. Two approaches are used simultaneously. The former is a numerical one and consists in a fine rotor/stator contact simulation. Various contactimpact algorithms and time integration schemes are tested on elementary cases. The Lagrange multiplier method {{appears to be the}} most appropriate one for dynamic studies. The latter approach is an experimental one and consists in a vibratory study of the mechanical <b>coupling</b> between the <b>casing</b> and the fan bladed disk so as to determine what parameters generate interaction. A simplified experimental test rig is used. Interaction is produced with selected casing and blade modes...|$|R
40|$|Continuous, single-channel {{reflection}} profiling {{has been}} carried out in PVC-lined boreholes, primarily with the aim of ascertaining the position of an old subsurface gas storage tunnel on a proposed dam site. Tube wave reflection patterns thus generated have been interpreted in terms of sediment rigidity and shear wave velocity, and these results could be compared with some independent data. It is interesting to note that, within the well section penetrating Tertiary clays, the velocity of the hydraulic transients apparently was not affected by the PVC casing, which might be explained by a tight <b>coupling</b> between <b>casing</b> and clay wall. In such situations, tube waves turn out a straightforward tool for the determination of shear wave velocity and the derivation of dynamic elastic moduli of unconsolidated sediments. Further applications of the study of the distribution of seismic velocities on the dam site dealt with the consolidation history of the clays. A level of abnormally low P-wave velocities has been detected and interpreted as a gas-charged horizon which, by its coincidence with the base level of clay diapirs, might be considered to have contributed to clay flowage in past geological times. Data about maximum past burial depth, derived from shear wave velocities, turned out to be in agreement with results from consolidation testing...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{discussion}} of the safety and cost of underground high-pressure air and gas storage systems based on recent experience with a high-pressure air system installed at Moffett Field, California. The system described used threaded and <b>coupled</b> oil well <b>casings</b> installed vertically to a depth of 1200 ft. Maximum pressure was 3000 psi and capacity was 500, 000 lb of air. A failure mode analysis is presented, and it is shown that underground storage offers advantages in avoiding catastrophic consequences from pressure vessel failure. Certain problems such as corrosion, fatigue, and electrolysis are discussed in terms of the economic life of such vessels. A cost analysis shows that where favorable drilling conditions exist, the cost of underground high-pressure storage is approximately one-quarter that of equivalent aboveground storage...|$|R
40|$|A {{clearance}} {{control apparatus}} has a positioning mechanism for controlling clearance between rotor blade tips and a shroud segment {{of a gas}} turbine engine casing. The positioning mechanism {{is supported by the}} <b>casing,</b> <b>coupled</b> to the shroud segment, and actuatable for moving the shroud segment toward and away from the rotor blade tips to reach a position at which a desired clearance is established. The mechanism includes a shaft and a bellcrank actuating assembly. The shaft is mounted through a passage defined by a mounting structure on the casing for radial movement along a longitudinal axis of the shaft toward and away from the rotor axis and is coupled at its inner end to the shroud segment. The bellcrank actuating assembly is coupled to an outer end of the shaft and mounted to the casing adjacent the shaft for pivotal movement about an axis spaced from and extending transverse to the longitudinal axis of the shaft. The pivotal movement of the bellcrank actuating assembly produces radial movement of the shaft and shroud segment therewith toward and away from the rotor blade tips...|$|R
30|$|A {{critical}} challenge {{confronting the}} commercial utilization of supercritical geothermal systems {{is the need}} for drilling systems, well completion methods, power plants, logging tools, and characterization methods that can withstand high temperatures and aggressive fluids. Several European Commission funded projects addressed and are currently addressing these issues. The HiTI project (High Temperature Instruments for supercritical geothermal reservoir characterization and exploitation) focused on developing high-temperature tools and methods (Ásmundsson et al. 2014; Sanjuan et al. 2010). This work focused on the development and testing of a high-temperature distributed temperature sensing (DTS) cable (Reinsch and Henninges 2010; Reinsch et al. 2013) and a wireline temperature tool, the MultiSensor memory tool that records temperature, pressure, fluid flow and casing collar locations, high-temperature borehole televiewer and resistivity logging tools, and new Na/Li geothermometers (Sanjuan et al. 2010, 2014), and high-temperature tracers (Gadalia et al. 2010; Juliusson et al. 2015). The DESCRAMBLE project developed a slick-line temperature and pressure logging tool by SINTEF that can withstand downhole conditions of 450  °C and 450  bar for up to 8 h. The IMAGE (Integrated Methods for Advanced Geothermal Exploration) initiative {{led to the development of}} new seismic and electromagnetic investigation methods for characterizing supercritical systems (van Wees et al. 2015), and these methods have been employed at the IDDP sites in Iceland. One approach involves adaption the seismic-while-drilling method to geothermal systems (Poletto et al. 2011 a,b). In addition, new laboratory set-ups were developed to investigate rock properties at supercritical conditions (e.g., Kummerow and Raab 2015 a, b). The objective of the GeoWell project is to develop reliable, cost-effective, and environmentally safe well completion and monitoring technologies to accelerate the development of geothermal resources for power generation in Europe and worldwide. These technologies were deployed in traditional production wells as well as deeper wells, where the pressure may be as high as 150  bar and temperature can exceed 400  °C. These technologies include all aspects of the well completion process, such as optimization of cementing and sealing procedures, selection of materials and <b>coupling</b> of <b>casings,</b> temperature and strain measurements in wells using fiber optic technologies to monitor well integrity, and development of risk-assessment methods.|$|R
40|$|Lateral {{vibration}} of rotors can {{be significantly}} reduced by inserting the damping elements between the shaft and the casing. The theoretical analysis, confirmed by computational simulations, shows that {{to achieve the}} optimum compromise between attenuation of the oscillation amplitude and magnitude of the forces transmitted through the coupling elements between the rotor and the stationary part, the damping effect must be controllable. For this purpose, the squeeze film dampers lubricated by magnetorheological fluid can be applied. The damping effect {{is controlled by the}} change of intensity of the magnetic field in the lubricating film. This article presents a procedure developed for investigation of the steady state response of rigid rotors <b>coupled</b> with the <b>casing</b> by flexible elements and short magnetorheological dampers. Their lateral vibration is governed by nonlinear (due to the damping forces) equations of motion. The steady state solution is obtained by application of a collocation method, which arrives at solving a set of nonlinear algebraic equations. The pressure distribution in the oil film is described by a Reynolds equation modified for the case of short dampers and Bingham fluid. Components of the damping force are calculated by integration of the pressure distribution around the circumference and {{along the length of the}} damper. The developed procedure makes possible to determine the steady state response of rotors excited by their unbalance, to determine magnitude of the forces transmitted through the coupling elements in the supports into the stationary part and is intended for proposing the control of the damping effect to achieve optimum performance of the dampers...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed {{eddy current}} (PEC) testing {{technology}} {{is widely used}} {{in the field of}} large area corrosion detection. According to the material attributes of detected objects, there are mainly two fields in which PEC technology is used: Non-ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic material testing. When the testing object is ferromagnetic, the decaying speed of the received signal differs according to the difference of the material’s electrical conductivity, magnetic permeability and thickness. This paper states the realization of a type of PEC testing system and its application in ferromagnetic pipe testing from inside and outside of the pipe. The system consists of an exciting module, a signal receiving module, coil probes and a personal computer (PC). The exciting signal is generated by Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) integrated circuit and the exciting coil is powered by an integrated power operational amplifier. The received signal is filtered and amplified by low noise wide dynamic range amplifying circuit. The signal is then digitized by USB data acquisition system. A PC is used for signal processing and analysis. Experiments were taken with two kinds of coil structure probes to test ferromagnetic pipe from outside and inside of the pipe respectively. One type of coil probe which has the advantage of eliminating vibration effect during the well logging process in oil industry is employed to find the <b>coupling</b> part of <b>casing</b> from the inside. Another type of coil probe is used to test the wall thickness loss through coatings from the outside of the pipe and it is able to detect 10 % wall thickness loss with probe lift-off up to 80 mm so it can be employed to test high temperature parts without removal of coatings...|$|R
40|$|LectureCompressors {{for carbon}} dioxide (CO 2) {{applications}} {{have been widely}} used in the O&G industry for urea production, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and CO 2 pipeline services for many years. New environmental challenges have re-focused the attention on increasing the efficiency of rotating equipment including optimization of the equipment configuration. To address these challenges, an electric motor driven CO 2 compressor train has been designed for a large CO 2 injection project in Western Australia. This compressor train was equipped with two compressor <b>casings</b> <b>coupled</b> through two gearboxes on either side of a double-ended variable frequency drive (VFD) motor. For the CO 2 injection project, the risk of condensation inside the carbon steel pipeline between compressor discharge and the injection wells was identified as a concern. The mixture of liquid water and CO 2 results in carbonic acid that may result in corrosion of the carbon steel pipeline. To mitigate this risk the water needs to be removed from the CO 2 stream prior to entering the pipeline. To maximize the removal of water, the CO 2 compressor intermediate stage (3 rd stage) pressure is required to operate within a fixed pressure range. The compressor string with two gearboxes, two compressor casings and a VFD results in a complicated torsional system. In cases where torsional vibration frequencies coincide with resonance frequencies, large torsional deflections and internal stresses could be generated. Continuous operation under these conditions could result in fatigue failure. Free-vibration analysis and a forced-response analysis were conducted for an analytical review of rotor response to static and harmonic torsional loads. VFD motors generate pulsating torques; even if the pulsating torques are very small with respect to the main torque, they can excite compressor train resonances with potential shaft and/or couplings damages. Final validation of the compressor trains has been the Full Speed, Full Load test and ASME PTC 10 Type 1 performance test campaign conducted in June 2011. During this testing, torque pulsation measurements has been conducted for validation of torsional analytical results and pulsation amplitudes under steady state and start-up conditions. The compressor train was designed to be modularized. This required the package?s overall dimensions to meet very stringent space constraints. The project engineering challenges include: ergonomic design focusing on improving maintenance and operations access, compressor supports stiffness analysis for installation on module steel work and compressor train operability assessment. High CO 2 discharge pressures, high operating temperatures and the need to minimize fugitive emissions result in challenges for the dry gas seals system (DGS) and lead to the design of a highly customized DGS configuration...|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 167 One of the {{foremost}} concerns facing pump users today is that of rotordynamics. As pump speeds have increased to provide improved efficiencies and lighter packages, rotordynamics has assumed a significantly greater role in determining pump reliability. Pump rotordynamic problems often manifest themselves as shaft fatigue failures and wear/failures of bearings, seals, and impellers. The aim {{of this paper is}} to provide users with a basic understanding of rotordynamics and a practical design procedure that can be used to ensure that their pumping systems will not encounter major difficulties in the field. Since pumps are inherently hydraulic devices, their rotordynamic behavior is considerable different from that of their pneumatic turbomachinery counterparts like compressors and turbines. Accordingly, the paper concentrates on these differences and how to handle them in the design process. The paper begins with a review of the fundamentals of rotordynamics and the types of analyses that should be employed in the design process. Guidelines are provided for modelling and for performing rotordynamic staples such as undamped critical speed, unbalance response, and damped natural frequency/stability analysis. The generation of a critical speed map and the tremendous amount of information that can be gleaned from it is also described in detail. Attention is then turned to the factors that render the rotordynamic analysis of pumps significantly different from that of pneumatic turbomachinery. First and foremost is the fact that the mass of fluid contained in hydraulic machines is significant compared with that of the rotor. The ?wet? critical speeds of a pump are usually considerably different from their ?dry? counterparts. A major factor in this difference is that locations of close-clearance annular fits, such as at seals, balance pistons, wear rings, and impellers, generate significant fluid-structure interaction forces that must be incorporated into the model as dynamic stiffness, damping, and mass coefficients. The presence of these additional supports can generate rotor instabilities and introduce errors into the calculation of journal bearing dynamic coefficients. Additionally, the liquid mass entrained within impellers can produce a ?hydraulic unbalance? which is often larger than the mechanical unbalance and, thus, must be accounted for in response calculations. Finally, rotors immersed in liquid experience a fluid <b>coupling</b> with their <b>casings</b> that is not accounted for in conventional calculations. The unique problems often associated with vertical pumps are then explored in detail. Since the ?casing? for many vertical pumps is a cantilevered flexible column, rotor-casing interactions must be accounted for by a means such as multilevel modelling. In addition, due to the absence of a gravity load, vertical pump bearing are usually lightly loaded, rendering them especially susceptible to instability problems. Finally, the use of process fluids to lubricate journal bearings often requires nonstandard means for determination of the dynamic coefficients. The paper concludes with a generic step-by-step procedure that users can utilize to analyze any pumping machine they might encounter...|$|R
