Three type of preservatives; ammoniacal copper quartenary, borax boric acid and <b>copper</b> <b>chrome</b> <b>arsenic</b> {{were used in}} the study at 1, 2, 4 and 8 % concentrations. Three type of treatment techniques; soaking, vacuum impregnation and high pressure sap-displacement were used in treating the bamboo. The results of the study show that the 2 year-old G. scortechinii had higher NDSR when compared with the 4 year-old culms across all the treatment processes. In between the various treatment processes, the vacuum pressure process gave the highest NDSR. This was followed closely by soaking and then at a somewhat lower NDSR by high-pressure sap-displacement processes, respectively. This suggests that the vacuum pressure process and the soaking process may be more effective in term of the NDSR values. The treatment processes ranked in the following order of decreasing NDSR: Vacuum Pressure>Soaking>High Pressure Sap-Displacement. The type of preservative {{played an important role in}} influencing the preservative NDSR. Between the 3 preservatives used in the study, BBA, which has high diffusion ability, gave the highest NDSR followed by CCA and ACQ, respectively in the soaking process.

40|$|Wood-water {{interactions}} {{including the}} effect of grain orientation, sample size and water potential in Pinus radiata D. Don were investigated. The influence of various chemical treatments on the wood-water interaction was also evaluated. The uptake of moisture by wood soaking in water was determined using the water soak method developed by Rowell and Banks (1985). Treatments with surfactants such as ammoniacal copper-didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC-ACQ) and linoleate salts increased the initial uptake rates of the wafers, whilst treatment with <b>copper</b> <b>chrome</b> <b>arsenic</b> (CCA), linseed oil (LO) and a combined CCA/LO treatment reduced uptakes of moisture. The length of time {{used to assess the}} water repellent effectiveness (WRE) was found to be crucial to the test, with most of the reduction in WRE occurring in the first 15 minutes of soaking. Exposure of wax treated wafers to weathering indicated an initial gradual reduction in efficacy, which decreased more rapidly as the length of exposure time increased Tests on the effectiveness of different wood coatings subjected to high humidity illustrated the importance of a film with low permeability and some elasticity. Wood blocks coated with resorcinol-formaldehyde resin initially inhibited moisture ingress, but failed after prolonged exposure. An extra coat increased the time required before failure. Coating the wood wafer with a silicone resin slightly reduced the uptake of water into the wafer. However, this resin was more permeable than the resorcinol-formaldehyde resin and was not as efficacious. The effect of various oil treatments on the uptake of water vapour indicated that the distribution of the oil is critical to inhibiting vapour uptake. No significant difference was found between the moisture uptake of hardwood and softwood stakes. Treatment with trimethylborate (TMB), DDAC-ACQ and CCA had no significant effect on the extent of vapour taken up by the wood. An experiment designed to investigate the importance of sample size when assessing wood performance was carried out using matched samples of treated and untreated quartersawn and flatsawn Pines radiata D. Don. It was found that samples treated with DDAC-ACQ and exposed outdoors experienced a greater flux in moisture content compared to controls. CCA reduced the extent of moisture uptake, with the incorporation of oil further enhancing the short term weathering performance. Quartersawn wood exhibited a smaller moisture flux than the flatsawn timber. However, the performance of CCA/Oil treated quartersawn wood was only marginally better than the quartersawn controls. Laboratory trials gave an identical treatment ranking as the exterior trial; however the use of the smaller sample size was identified as being inappropriate for the assessment of check formation in the timber. A sample size effect was demonstrated when assessing the efficacy of treatments by the water soak method. A treatment gradient could be demonstrated when whole stakes were impregnated with CCA and linseed oil by a two-stage process. The test indicated that the significance of improvements in the water repellency of treated wafers diminishes when larger sized samples are investigated. The effect of soil water availability on wood moisture content was determined for untreated hardwood and softwood sticks. At low soil moisture contents, hardwood sticks were found to be significantly more saturated than their softwood counterparts. At higher soil water contents (100 % water holding capacity (WHC)) the performance of the two species of wood became less significant. Chemical treatment was found to {{have a significant effect on}} reducing wood moisture levels when free water was available in the soil. Linseed oil was responsible for a significant reduction in moisture uptake, by blocking the pathways for water uptake as well as by decreasing the void volume available in the wood for water to occupy. Incorporation of a drying agent did not improve the quality of the film formed by the linseed oil as no significant change in water repellent performance was identified. The uptake and movement of water through a horticultural post was simulated using a procedure described by Baines and Levy (1979). The wick action of heartwood and sapwood stakes of Pinus radiata D. Don was investigated with distinct moisture distribution and behaviours found. Heartwood, being less permeable, showed a reduction in the volume of vapour that moved through the wood, as well as a much lower stake moisture content compared to the sapwood. This difference was most pronounced above the air/water interface and helps to explain the difference in decay resistance exhibited by the two wood types. End sealing the stakes with silicone resin was found to have no significant effect on the wick action of the stake. Lumen filling treatments with wax, oil and alkyd resins were found to significantly alter the wick action of the stakes. Treatment with low concentrations of surface active compounds such as DDAC-ACQ and linoleate soaps were found to increase the rate of water uptake. At higher concentrations the presence of the surfactant increased the hydrophobicity of the wood and reduced moisture uptake. Biological testing using a fungal cellar determined that treatment of the wood with CCA/LO, CCA, DDAC-ACQ/LO, LO and DDAC-ACQ significantly improved the resistance of the wood to decay. The incorporation of linseed oil did not cause a significant improvement to the decay resistance of the stakes over the trial periodRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
40|$|In {{present day}} society {{there is an}} {{artificial}} dichotomy between wastes and resources that is perhaps best summed up by the Western Sydney Waste Board slogan 'there {{is no such thing}} as waste � only resources in the wrong place and at the wrong time'. Waste management was originally driven by managing the health consequences of wrong time/place materials. This has changed and the significant driver is now the sustainable utilisation of resources, that is, trying to optimally recover as resources (right time/place) those materials that present as wastes requiring management. However, it is not acceptable to justify a resource recovery option purely on the basis that it is diverting material away from landfill. Preferences are emerging for recovery activities that maximise the resource value of a material according to techno-economic, environmental and socio-political criteria; collectively known as the criteria of sustainability. The people and organisations articulating these preferences include owners/operators of resource recovery centres, proponents of alternative waste management technologies, waste planners and managers at both a state and local government level and environmental NGOs representing community interests, in addition to the generators of waste at a domestic, commercial and industrial, and construction and demolition level. It is therefore important to be able to answer the question of 'what is the optimal or most sustainable resource recovery option for materials presenting as waste to landfill in the Greater Sydney Region?' The point of departure for this thesis is twofold. Firstly, that optimal resource recovery options (also known as alternative waste management technologies) can be identified by understanding the context and system drivers and constraints within the system of waste generation and utilisation, by modelling the system using industrial ecology (specifically Materials Flux Analysis) and by using the technology assessment framework developed by the NSW Alternative Waste Management Technologies and Practices Inquiry to evaluate the available options. Secondly, that should the assessment framework from the NSW Inquiry prove to be unsuitable as a framework for evaluation, then an improved and refined assessment framework can be constructed in order to identify optimal resource recovery options and that this process can be successfully demonstrated using wood waste as a case study. The context of waste as an issue has shifted from local government control (pre- 1970 s) to state government control through the Department of Environment and Conservation. This transition followed experiments with organisations such as the NSW Waste Boards and Resource NSW, in addition to state targets such as a 60 % reduction of waste to landfill by the year 2000. In addition to this backdrop of change from a government administrative perspective, there are also a suite of often conflicting drivers and constraints influencing the process of resource recovery. For example, sustainable development is a public policy driver for the integration of environmental and societal concerns, but can also constrain new innovation if competing 'status quo' utilisation options are not subject to the same scrutiny. Similarly, legislation acts as a constraint to resource recovery options by establishing license conditions, prohibiting some energy recovery options and setting recovery criteria; however legislation also acts as a driver for resource recovery options that generate renewable electricity or act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Other drivers and constraints include social, technical and economic issues and concerns in addition to environmental impacts such as emissions to air, land and water. Industrial ecology is a model for viewing system components as part of a dependent and interrelated greater whole. Within the context of Industrial Ecology, waste is a by-product of manufacture available as a beneficial input into other processes. Using Materials Flux Analysis as a tool to build a model of waste generation and utilisation, elements within the system are presented as a series of stocks (sources), technology interventions (transformation flows) and sinks (markets). The stocks or sources of materials for resource recovery are categorised as Municipal Solid (MSW), Commercial and Industrial (C&I) or Construction and Demolition (C&D) wastes. Approximately seven million tonnes of waste is generated in the Greater Sydney Region (nearly two and a half million tonnes of materials recovered for recycling and four and a half million tonnes of materials disposed of to landfill). The purpose of technology intervention is to transform the material into a product that is suited to the end market (sink). Markets are grouped according to reuse (same function and form), direct recycling (same supply chain), indirect recycling (different supply chain) and energy recovery (either as process heat, electricity or co-generation, a combination of the two). Landfill is also a potential sink for materials and in this sense can be thought of as a negative value market. The Alternative Waste Management Technologies and Practices Inquiry provided an assessment framework for resource recovery technologies. Each technology was measured and compared against 16 evaluation criteria, resulting in a score out of one hundred. Material sorting scored the highest (81. 5), incineration the lowest (50. 8) with most of the biological technologies performing �well� (64. 6 � 71. 7) and with the landfill technologies performing 'moderately well' (60. 4 - 61. 4). The positive features of the Inquiry included the overview of alternative resource recovery technologies, waste generation and other issues pertinent to decision making and resource recovery. The negatives of the Inquiry arise from the inadequacies of the assessment framework, which lacked technology options, system boundary definition and requisite evaluation criteria in addition to inconsistencies in scoring approaches. By undertaking a sensitivity analysis on the Inquiry�s results, it is shown that rank order reversal results from the allocation of weightings. The improved and refined assessment framework, constructed to overcome identified inadequacies of the Inquiry�s approach, focussed on clearly identifying the problem to be addressed and the primary decision maker involved in the process; ensuring that appropriate options for evaluation were included; defining the system boundary for the assessment; selecting necessary evaluation criteria; adopting a more sophisticated system for scoring; and using a sensitivity analysis to validate the results of the resource recovery option evaluation. Wood waste was used as a case study for this second assessment methodology. Wood waste refers to the end-of-life products, failed products, offcuts, shavings and sawdust from all timber products. Approximately 350, 000 tonnes of wood waste are disposed of to landfill each year. This comprises untreated timber (hard wood and soft wood), engineered timber products (particleboard, medium density fibreboard and plywood) and treated timber (predominately <b>copper</b> <b>chrome</b> <b>arsenic).</b> Eight wood resource recovery options are selected for evaluation within the Greater Sydney Region with a different approach to scoring that has the advantage of 'scaling up' the best performers within each attribute (highest score) while 'scaling down' the worst performers (no score). Under this evaluation, an on-site purpose built energy facility is the most preferred option with particleboard manufacture the least preferred option. A sensitivity analysis of the results reveals that the scores of each technology option are sensitive to the weightings of the decision maker. When the change in rankings is examined, it is identified that two eight wood recovery options undergo a large rank reversal. A critique of the results of the wood evaluation reveals five major flaws. Firstly the evaluation produces non-highest resource value results that are non-intuitive (and arguably misleading), for example the poor performance of reuse and particleboard against energy generation options. Secondly, the recording of a single summary score for each recovery option hides unacceptable performance levels in some criteria. For example, the top scorer of Primary Energy On-site hides the fact that such an option is likely to have no political desirability (likely public opposition to 'incineration' within the Sydney air-shed), calling into question its ability to be implemented as a solution. Thirdly there is a reliance on judgement for the scoring of options and weighting of preferences, calling into doubt the accuracy of scores. Fourthly, the rankings of recovery options by the assessment framework are sensitive to the allocation of weightings. Finally and most importantly, the refined evaluation approach suffers from the 'discrete option syndrome', the scoring of each recovery option in isolation with no ability to look at integrated systems with joint recovery options. This is pinpointed as a fundamental flaw in the process of both the Inquiry and the wood evaluation. This leads to the conclusion that the founding assertions of this thesis were false. That is to say that the assessment framework developed by the NSW Alternative Waste Management Technologies and Practices Inquiry is not suitable for use in evaluating resource recovery options. Furthermore a refined assessment framework based on this approach is also unable to identify optimal resource recovery options as demonstrated using wood waste as a case study. The results of this research points to the overall conclusion that any discrete option evaluation and assessment for resource recovery technologies that results in a single summary score for each option will be fundamentally flawed, providing no value in determining optimal resource recovery solutions for the Greater Sydney Region. A systems approach is suggested as an alternative method for the evaluation of optimal resource recovery, the starting point of which is to ask 'what is the highest resource value of the components in the material stream under consideration and how could a network of infrastructure be designed in order to allow materials to flow to their highest resource value use?' A feature of such an integrated approach is a focus on the materials composition of recovered resources, as opposed to recovery technologies, resulting in a 'fit for purpose' as opposed to a 'forced fit' style of resource recovery. It is recommended that further research and public policy efforts be made in logistics planning across the Greater Sydney Region (as opposed to a regional or local government area) in order to create network opportunities for integrated flows of materials to move toward their highest resource value...|$|E

The results obtained indicate that some chemical parameter of the river water vary in the different seasons of the year. The salinity, dissolved oxygen and biochemical demand of oxygen were found to be low, no toxic substances were detected in significant amounts, and the water quality has not been affected by the mining activity...|$|R

[...] While some slowdowns and negotiations occurred, the Soviet Union met all of its requirements under the agreement. [...] It became a major supplier of vital materials to Germany, including petroleum, manganese, <b>copper,</b> nickel, <b>chrome,</b> platinum, lumber and grain. During the first period of the agreement (February 11, 1940, to February 11, 1941), Germany received: ...|$|R

40|$|A hydride cold-trapping {{technique}} {{was developed and}} optimised for the measurement of urinary arsenic metabolites. The analytical precision of the method {{was found to be}} 6. 1, 4. 0 and 4. 8 % (n = 5) for inorganic arsenic (As-i), monomethylarsonate (MMA) and dimethylarsinate (DMA), respectively, with recoveries close to 100 %, The detection limits were 1. 0, 1. 3 and 3 ng for As-i, MMA and DMA, respectively. The method was then used to analyse urine samples obtained from three groups of workers for occupational exposure in three companies where <b>copper</b> <b>chrome</b> arsenate was used for timber treatment. The results were compared with those for a normal control group of laboratory workers. Arsenic and its metabolites were also measured in experimental rats given 5 mg As kg(- 1) body mass by oral gavage in the form of sodium arsenite, calcium arsenite or sodium arsenate. Occupational workers showed a significantly higher excretion of As-i, Up to two fold increases of urinary As-i excretion in rats compared with control rats were also observed in animals dosed with various forms of arsenicals. The method is suitable for the measurement of arsenic metabolites in urine of both humans and experimental animals...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWainuiomata, a {{suburban}} town {{located at the}} southern end of the North Island of New Zealand, is subject to air particulate matter pollution episodes during the winter. The results of fine (PM 2. 5) and coarse (PM 2. 5 – 10) particulate matter monitoring in Wainuiomata from July 2006 –September 2008 are presented. Receptor modeling was used to determine the sources contributing to particulate matter pollution and mass contributions to ambient particle concentrations from emission sources were estimated. PM 10 concentrations displayed a seasonal pattern, with peak concentrations occurring during the winter. The results demonstrate that marine aerosol and crustal matter sources were the primary contributors to the coarse particle fraction, while the fine particle fraction was dominated by biomass burning with smaller contributions from marine aerosol and secondary sulfate particles. Arsenic was found to be present in the fine particle fraction and was associated with biomass burning, suggesting the use of <b>copper</b> <b>chrome</b> arsenate treated timber for domestic heating. Analysis of seasonal differences revealed that biomass burning was largely responsible for fine particle pollution episodes during the winter. Marine aerosol featured significantly as a PM 10 source all year due to New Zealand’s remote oceanic location...|$|R
40|$|Three {{distinct}} {{chemical processes}} have been investigated, {{with the aim}} of producing high purity 1, 5 -pentanediol (PDO), 1, 4 -butanediol (BDO) and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) and thereby improving the efficiency of their manufacture. The production of 1, 5 -pentanediol via the low-pressure vapour phase hydrogenation of 1, 5 -dimethylpentanedioate has been studied using a copper manganese heterogeneous catalyst system and found {{to be as good as}} the usually favoured <b>copper</b> <b>chrome,</b> which is now becoming difficult to operate commercially due to toxicity concerns. The optimum conditions were determined for a commercial process. The purification of the PDO produced, to the high standards dictated by polymer manufacture, has also been examined. Simple distillation was not possible because reactive oligomeric species were present. To overcome this, a reactive distillation scheme was developed and demonstrated experimentally. During the manufacture of 1, 4 -butanedlol, a by-product (4 -hydroxybutyl) - 2 - tetrahydrofuran, known commercially as "Acetal", is formed during hydrogenation and proves very difficult to remove by conventional means. By conversion of this compound to more volatile species, by hydrogenation over a nickel catalyst, it was demonstrated that the purity of BDO obtained was greater than that previously possible...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} vacuum plasma spray (VPS) {{material}} {{systems have been}} successfully applied to injector and thrust chamber components. VPS offers a versatile fabrication process with relatively low costs to produce near net shape parts. The materials available with VPS increase operating margins and improve component life by providing superior thermal and oxidation protection in specific engine environments. Functional gradient materials (FGM) formed with VPS allow thrust chamber liners to be fabricated with GRCop- 84 (an alloy of <b>copper,</b> <b>chrome,</b> and niobium) and a protective layer of NiCrAlY on the hot wall. A variety of thrust chamber liner designs have been fabricated to demonstrate the versatility of the process. Hot-fire test results have confined the improved durability and high temperature performance of the material systems for thrust chamber liners. Similar FGM s have been applied to provide superior thermal protection on injector faceplates with NiCrAlY and zirconia coatings. The durability of the applied materials has been demonstrated with hot-fire cycle testing on injector faceplates in high temperature environments. The material systems can benefit the components used in booster and main engine propulsion systems. More recent VPS efforts are focused on producing rhenium based material systems for high temperature applications to benefit in-space engines like reaction control system (RCS) thrusters...|$|R
