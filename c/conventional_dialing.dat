50|$|The dial of the Grillo phone employs an {{innovative}} {{solution to the}} design challenge of condensing the dial mechanism into a limited space, while still incorporating a finger-stop. The Grillo phone's dial couldn't employ a conventional finger-stop like the type found on <b>conventional</b> <b>dial</b> phones, but instead has a button {{within each of the}} dial's number holes, which, when depressed, pushes a pin through the back of the dial which stops the dial once it's turned to the dial's end position.|$|R
5000|$|The Rekord B {{had come}} with a curious [...] "strip speedometer", {{featuring}} a coloured line that grew longer as speed increased, and which changed colour from green to yellow to red as the most common speed limit thresholds of 50 km/h and 100 km/h were crossed. Opinions were divided on the strip speedometer, and with the Rekord C Opel reverted to a <b>conventional</b> <b>dial</b> format speedometer, suggesting that for them too, the expanding colour changing strip speedometer {{had fallen out of}} fashion.|$|R
5000|$|The cockpit has <b>conventional</b> <b>dials,</b> with a {{head-up display}} (HUD) and a Shchel-3UM helmet mounted display, but no HOTAS ("hands-on-throttle-and-stick") capability. Emphasis {{seems to have}} been placed on making the cockpit similar to the earlier MiG-23 and other Soviet {{aircraft}} for ease of conversion, rather than on ergonomics. Nonetheless, the MiG-29 does have substantially better visibility than most previous Russian jet fighters, thanks to a high-mounted bubble canopy. Upgraded models introduce [...] "glass cockpits" [...] with modern liquid-crystal (LCD) multi-function displays (MFDs) and true HOTAS.|$|R
50|$|Local {{telephone}} companies were installing toll stations in distant {{rural areas as}} recently as the 1970s. While many of these points have subsequently been moved to <b>conventional</b> <b>dial</b> exchanges, in 1999 just over six hundred toll stations were still in service in the North American Numbering Plan. Many were a lone party line serving some remote hamlet too small for its own telephone exchange. In 1999, {{more than half of the}} remaining toll stations were in Canada, with Quebec and Newfoundland the largest users. The remaining US toll stations mostly served rural Nevada, with a handful in California and Oregon.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{deformation}} is {{an important}} parameter in structural health monitoring, and a conjugate beam method based on long-gauge fiber Bragg grating distributed strain sensing techniques is proposed to obtain the deformation of a structure. Some experiments are carried out to study the accuracy of this method using a four point bending RC beam under a step loading manner. The deformation obtained with the proposed method agrees well with those obtained with the <b>conventional</b> <b>dial</b> gauge in low loading steps. In addition, some measure is put forward to calibrate the proposed method and improve its accuracy at high loading steps, especially after the initiation of concrete cracks...|$|R
40|$|Two riveted antenna {{panels on}} rings number 3 and 9 {{were removed from}} the 34 m antenna at DSS- 15, fixed in the leveled {{position}} and the surface was photographed indoors. The results from this pilot photogrammetric demonstration and diagnostics of panel surface contours, are presented. The photogrammetric network for each panel incorporated eight photographs, two from each of four camera stations and observed over 200 targets. The accuracy (1 sigma) of the XYZ coordinates for the error ellipsoids was + or - 0. 013 mm (0. 0005 inch). This level of precision relative to the object size corresponds roughly to 1 part in 250, 000 which is superior to <b>conventional</b> <b>dial</b> sweep-arm template techniques by at least a factor of 4...|$|R
5000|$|The first digital {{pocket watch}} was the {{invention}} of Austrian engineer Josef Pallweber who created his [...] "jump-hour" [...] mechanism in 1883. Instead of a <b>conventional</b> <b>dial,</b> the jump-hour featured two windows in an enamel dial, through which the hours and minutes are visible on rotating discs. The second hand remained conventional. By 1885 Pallweber mechanism {{was already on the}} market in pocket watches by Cortébert and IWC; arguably contributing to the subsequent rise and commercial success of IWC. The principles of Pallweber jump-hour movement had appeared in wristwatches by the 1920s (Cortébert) and are still used today (Chronoswiss Digiteur). While the original inventor didn't have a watch brand at the time, his name has since been resurrected by a newly established watch manufacturer.|$|R

50|$|In 2002 the British Army's L118 guns {{completed}} {{replacement of}} their optical sights with the LINAPS artillery pointing system (APS) mounted above the barrel. This is a self-contained system that uses three ring laser gyros to determine azimuth, elevation angle and trunnion tilt angle. It also includes facilities for navigation and self-survey using a global positioning system, inertial direction measurement and distance measurement. All {{this can be}} used {{anywhere in the world}} to lay the gun without external references. The outputs and inputs for APS are through the touchscreen layer's display and control unit (LCDU) that replaced the <b>conventional</b> <b>dial</b> sight and its mount. The LCDU enables the layer to lay the gun by moving the barrel until the LCDU displays no difference between the ordered firing data and where the barrel is pointing as determined by the LINAPS sensors.|$|R

40|$|We are {{exploring}} {{a new approach}} to remote chemical identification that promises higher precision than can be achieved by <b>conventional</b> <b>DIAL</b> approaches. This technique also addresses and potentially solves the problem of detecting a target gas in the presence of an interfering gas or gases. This new approach utilizes an eye-safe infrared optical pumping pulse to deplete the population of a specific rotational level(s) and then sends probe pulses at the same or different wavelengths to interrogate the bleaching of the absorption. We have experimentally measured optical saturation fluence level at atmospheric pressure for HCl, and find this level to be {approximately} 1 mJ/cm{sup 2 }, significantly below eye-safe limits in agreement with calculations. Calculations have been performed on other molecules of interest with similar results. In the laboratory, using time-delay-replicated pulses at a single frequency we have made absorption measurements with precision levels routinely approaching 0. 1 % after averaging 200 laser pulses. These results {{as well as those of}} two other pulse experiments will be presented. 5 refs., 9 figs., 1 tab...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} Raman and elastic-backscatter lidar {{for independent}} profiling of tropospheric aerosols, moisture, and ozone, and also stratospheric ozone and aerosol parameters is presented. GKSS operates this advanced Raman lidar at Geesthacht, Germany (53. 4 N, 10. 4 E). First routine ozone measurements were taken between February and April 1995, simultaneously with the European SESAME (Second European Stratospheric Arctic and Mid-latitude Experiment) campaign. The transmitter contains two lasers, a XeCl excimer laser and a frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser. The received backscattered light is separated in an eight-channel filter polychromator and detected by photomultipliers in single-photon countin mode. Ozone concentrations and aerosol and moisture profiles are obtained {{by applying the}} Raman-DIAL and <b>conventional</b> <b>DIAL</b> and the Raman lidar technique, respectively. Aerosol and moisture profiles are derived by applying the common Raman technique. Examples of the measured aerosol, ozone, moisture and temperature profiles are shown. (orig.)

40|$|In this article, {{the design}} and {{development}} of a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) based displacement sensor package for submicron level displacement measurements are presented. A linear shift of 12. 12 nm in Bragg wavelength of the FBG sensor is obtained for a displacement of 6 mm with a calibration factor of 0. 495 mu m/pm. Field trials have also been conducted by comparing the FBG displacement sensor package against a <b>conventional</b> <b>dial</b> gauge, on a five block masonry prism specimen loaded using three-point bending technique. The responses from both the sensors are in good agreement, up {{to the failure of}} the masonry prism. Furthermore, from the real-time displacement data recorded using FBG, it is possible to detect the time at which early creaks generated inside the body of the specimen which then prorogate to the surface to develop visible surface cracks; the respective load from the load cell can be obtained from the inflection (stress release point) in the displacement curve. Thus the developed FBG displacement sensor package can be used to detect failures in structures much earlier and to provide an adequate time to exercise necessary action, thereby avoiding the possible disaster...|$|R

40|$|A novel lidar {{technique}} for ozone measurements in clouds is proposed. An injection-locked XeCl excimer laser {{serves as the}} light source. The ozone molecule number density is calculated from the differential absorption of the antiStokes rotational Raman return signals from nitrogen and oxygen as the on-resonance and the vibrational-rotational Raman backscattering from nitrogen or oxygen as the off-resonance wavelength. Model calculations show that the main advantages of the new RVR Raman <b>DIAL</b> over a <b>conventional</b> Raman <b>DIAL</b> are a drastic reduction of the wavelength-dependent effects of particle scattering on the measured ozone concentration, an increase in temporal resolution, and reduced complexity of the apparatus. An RVR Raman DIAL system is presently under construction at GKSS.

40|$|Double-pulse 2 -micron lasers {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} with energy as high as 600 millijouls and up to 10 Hz repetition rate. The two laser pulses are separated by 200 microseconds and can be tuned and locked separately. Applying double-pulse laser in DIAL system enhances the CO 2 measurement capability by increasing the overlap of the sampled volume between the on-line and off-line. To avoid detection complicity, integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar provides higher signal-to-noise ratio measurement compared to <b>conventional</b> range-resolved <b>DIAL.</b> Rather than weak atmospheric scattering returns, IPDA rely on the much stronger hard target returns that is best suited for airborne platforms. In addition, the IPDA technique measures the total integrated column content from the instrument to the hard target but with weighting that can be tuned by the transmitter. Therefore, the transmitter could be tuned to weight the column measurement to the surface for optimum CO 2 interaction studies or up to the free troposphere for optimum transport studies. Currently, NASA LaRC is developing and integrating a double-Pulsed 2 -micron direct detection IPDA lidar for CO 2 column measurement from an airborne platform.

40|$|The General Aviation Element of the Aviation Safety Program's Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS) Project is {{developing}} technology to eliminate low visibility induced General Aviation (GA) accidents. SVS displays present computer generated 3 -dimensional {{imagery of the}} surrounding terrain on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) to greatly enhance pilot's situation awareness (SA), reducing or eliminating Controlled Flight into Terrain, as well as Low-Visibility Loss of Control accidents. SVS-conducted research is facilitating development of display concepts that provide the pilot with an unobstructed view of the outside terrain, regardless of weather conditions and time of day. A critical component of SVS displays is the appropriate presentation of terrain to the pilot.

Composed of complementary simulation and flight test efforts, Terrain Portrayal for Head-Down Displays (TP-HDD) experiments will help researchers evaluate critical terrain portrayal concepts.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. In the manufacture of fully-fashioned knitted outerwear, it is usual for the garment sections to be constructed with a lower rib portion on to which is knitted a fashioned section of plain knitting. The majority of fully fashioned knitting machines are capable of producing only the plain fabric section, the rib portion being knitted separately on V-bed machines. In order to knit the plain section of the garment pieces on to the rib, each loop of the rib must be transferred to a corresponding knitting element on the fully fashioned knitting machine. It is common practice within the knitwear industry to perform this transfer manually, each loop of a slack course in the rib being impaled on {{to a point of}} a magazine bar, the excess courses of knitting being unroved as waste. The loops are then transferred from this bar, via a feeding bar on to the knitting elements of the fully-fashioned machine. This manual transfer of the loops is both tedious and expensive in terms of labour. However, there are recently developed machines on the market which will knit the rib and transfer it automatically to a magazine bar but they are both expensive and also render the existing plant obsolete. This thesis describes the concept, design and development of a novel patented automatic rib transfer system which relies on the relatively inexpensive modification of existing V-bed knitting machines. The modifications are aimed at providing a sub-assembly attachment suitable for a variety of V-bed knitting machines. Bars loaded automatically by these modified machines may be fed to any fully-fashioned knitting machine via a specially developed "gauge-changing" device to alter the pitch of the loops from that of the V-bed machine to that of the fully-fashioned machine. These automatically loaded bars may also be used to feed either a modern semi-automatic "linking system", such as the Boehringer Autolinker, or, in certain cases a <b>conventional</b> linking <b>dial.</b> NOTE. The term 'rib transfer' is used {{in the context of this}} thesis to describe the operation of transferring a knitted rib from a V-bed knitting machine to a straight bar knitting machine...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} use of a return-to- zero (RZPN) pseudo noise {{modulation}} technique for making range resolved measurements of CO 2 within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) using commercial, off-the-shelf, components. <b>Conventional,</b> range resolved, <b>DIAL</b> measurements require laser pulse widths that are significantly shorter than the desired spatial resolution and necessitate using pulses whose temporal spacing is such that scattered returns from only a single pulse are observed by the receiver at any one time (for the PBL pulse separations must be greater than approximately 20 microseconds). This imposes significant operational limitations when using currently available fiber lasers because of the resulting low duty cycle (less than approximately 0. 0005) and consequent low average laser output power. The RZPN modulation technique enables a fiber laser to operate at much higher duty cycles (approaching 0. 04) thereby more effectively utilizing the amplifier's output. This increases the counts received by approximately two orders of magnitude. Our approach involves employing two distributed feedback lasers (DFB), each modulated by a different RPZN code, whose outputs are then amplified by a CW fiber amplifier. One laser is tuned to a CO 2 absorption line; the other operates offline thereby permitting the simultaneous acquisition of both on and offline signals using independent RZPN codes. This minimizes the impact of atmospheric turbulence on the measurement. The on and offline signals are retrieved by deconvolving the return signal using the appropriate kernels...|$|R
