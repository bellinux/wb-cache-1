25|$|Diagnosis of {{a balance}} {{disorder}} is complicated {{because there are}} many kinds of balance disorders and because other medical conditions—including ear infections, blood pressure changes, and some vision problems—and some medications may contribute to a balance disorder. A person experiencing dizziness should see a physiotherapist or physician for an evaluation. A physician <b>can</b> <b>assess</b> for a medical disorder, such as a stroke or infection, if indicated. A physiotherapist <b>can</b> <b>assess</b> balance or a dizziness disorder and provide specific treatment.|$|E
25|$|Since many {{organizations}} depend on customers for profit, companies primarily evaluate employees {{based on their}} performance with customers. These customer reviews are then used to shape how companies function internally, directing what kinds of goals employees should have to achieve the company's overall mission. Then, organizations <b>can</b> <b>assess</b> performance based on the products that employees create. Finally, financial performance measures should be a focus to identify how employee achievements contribute to the business' profitability.|$|E

Sleep studies <b>can</b> <b>assess</b> airway {{status and the}} possible need for nighttime oxygen. Some patients may require surgical insertion of an endotrachial tube to aid breathing. Surgery can also correct hernias, help drain excessive cerebrospinal fluid from the brain, and free nerves and nerve roots compressed by skeletal and other abnormalities. Corneal transplants may improve vision among patients with significant corneal clouding.|$|E
25|$|The {{member states}} <b>can</b> <b>assess</b> {{merchandise}} from these areas {{with the common}} external tariff used for Mercosur merchandise, or, {{in the case of}} certain special products, the domestic tariff prevailing in each individual state. In this way, the products from the free-trade zones can have the more favorable tax treatment established under Southern Common Market, given to the merchandise produced in the normal customs zones of each member state or, in the case of certain special products, can have the normal customs treatment prevailing in each nation. Products coming from outside of Mercosur are highly taxed so that local companies do not feel the need to compete with large international companies.|$|E
25|$|The next {{generation}} of SNP annotation webservers {{can take advantage of}} the growing amount of data in core bioinformatics resources and use intelligent agents to fetch data from different sources as needed. From a user’s point of view, it is more efficient to submit a set of SNPs and receive results in a single step, which makes meta-servers the most attractive choice. However, if SNP annotation tools deliver heterogeneous data covering sequence, structure, regulation, pathways, etc., they must also provide frameworks for integrating data into a decision algorithm(s), and quantitative confidence measures so users <b>can</b> <b>assess</b> which data are relevant and which are not.|$|E

25|$|Prospective memory tasks {{can be used}} in {{a variety}} of ways to assess {{prospective}} memory. Firstly, results from these tasks can directly assess prospective memory. Furthermore, these tasks can be performed while experimenters use PET, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or MEG to monitor brain activation. Finally, these tasks can be followed by questionnaires about prospective memory. Combining different assessments can confirm or deny experimental findings, making sure that conclusions about prospective memory are accurate. All tasks <b>can</b> <b>assess</b> individual stages of prospective memory such as the formation or execution of an intention, or access prospective memory as a whole by looking at overall performance.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroo rats have a {{promiscuous}} mating system. Their {{reproductive output}} is highest in summer following high rainfalls. During droughts and food shortages, {{only a few}} females will breed. It appears that kangaroo rats <b>can</b> <b>assess</b> their local conditions and adjust their reproductive efforts accordingly. Merriam's kangaroo rats breed between February and May and produce two or three litters per year. Before mating, {{the male and female}} will perform nasal-anal circling until the female stops and allows the male to mount her. A Merriam's kangaroo rat female will allow multiple males to mount her in a short time, perhaps to ensure greater chances of producing offspring. Mating in banner-tailed kangaroo rats involve more chasing and foot drumming in the male before the females allows him to mate. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats mate on mounds and the more successful males chase away rival males. The gestation period of kangaroo rats lasts 22–27 days.|$|E
25|$|In , Stiglitz, José Antonio Ocampo (United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, until 2007), Shari Spiegel (Managing Director, Initiative for Policy Dialogue IPD), Ricardo Ffrench-Davis (Main Adviser, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ECLAC) and Deepak Nayyar (Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi) {{discuss the}} current debates on macroeconomics, capital market {{liberalization}} and development, {{and develop a}} new framework within which one <b>can</b> <b>assess</b> alternative policies. They explain their belief that the Washington Consensus has advocated narrow goals for development (with a focus on price stability) and prescribed too few policy instruments (emphasizing monetary and fiscal policies), and places unwarranted faith {{in the role of}} markets. The new framework focuses on real stability and long-term sustainable and equitable growth, offers a variety of non-standard ways to stabilize the economy and promote growth, and accepts that market imperfections necessitate government interventions. Policy-makers have pursued stabilization goals with little concern for growth consequences, while trying to increase growth through structural reforms focused on improving economic efficiency. Moreover, structural policies, such as capital market liberalization, have had major consequences for economic stability. This book challenges these policies by arguing that stabilization policy has important consequences for long-term growth and has often been implemented with adverse consequences. The first part of the book introduces the key questions and looks at the objectives of economic policy from different perspectives. The third part presents a similar analysis for capital market liberalization.|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{long history}} in this country of a {{separation}} of church and state, and the exemption of religious property from taxes.

[...] My great fear is that down the line governments might assume that the right to tax gives them the right to regulate.
