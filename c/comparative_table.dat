2500|$|Yet, with Revelation, the {{problems}} might be judged more fundamental. The author {{seems to be}} using his sources {{in a completely different}} way to the originals. For example, he borrows the 'new temple' imagery of Ezekiel 40–48 but uses it to describe a New Jerusalem which, quite pointedly, no longer needs a temple because it is God's dwelling. Ian Boxall writes that Revelation [...] "is no montage of biblical quotations (that is not John's way) but a wealth of allusions and evocations rewoven into something new and creative." [...] In trying to identify this [...] "something new", Boxall argues that Ezekiel provides the 'backbone' for Revelation. He sets out a <b>comparative</b> <b>table</b> listing the chapters of Revelation in sequence and linking most of them to the structurally corresponding chapter in Ezekiel. The interesting point is that the order is not the same. John, on this theory, rearranges Ezekiel to suit his own purposes.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Tolkien {{decided that the}} proto-{{language}} of the Elves was Valarin, the tongue of the gods or Valar as he called them: [...] "The language of the Elves derived in the beginning from the Valar, but they changed it even in the learning, and moreover modified and enriched it constantly at all times by their own invention." [...] In the <b>Comparative</b> <b>Tables</b> the mechanisms of sound change were described by Tolkien for the following daughter languages: Qenya, Lindarin (a dialect of Qenya), Telerin, Old Noldorin (or Fëanorian), Noldorin (or Gondolinian), Ilkorin (especially of Doriath), Danian of Ossiriand, East Danian, Taliska, West Lemberin, North Lemberin, and East Lemberin. For this proto-language of the Elves, Tolkien appears to have borrowed the five-part plosive system of Proto-Indo-European, the ancestor of Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, and others; namely, one labial, one coronal, and three velar plosives (palatal, plain, and labial).

40|$|For {{localized}} {{prostate cancer}} several treatment options are available. Patient decision aids can help patients {{in making a}} deliberative, personalized health choice in close collaboration with their physician. The aim {{of this research was}} to identify key components of a webbased decision aid for treatment choice of localized prostate cancer in an elderly patient group. Methods: One hundred men between 65 and 75 that have been diagnosed with localized prostate cancer at the University Hospital of Leuven, campus Gasthuisberg, were invited to use a web‐based DA in their decision making process. By means of web‐log files, general usage data and usage of with technology features included (such as patient statements, <b>comparative</b> <b>tables,</b> values clarification tool,…) could be analyzed. Results: Men spent on average 30 minutes on the web‐based decision aid. Most time was spent on the pages with information on treatment options. These pages were also most frequently accessed. The use of the feature ‘comparative tables’ was the highest, followed by the ‘values clarification tool’. According to age (70 years) differences were observed for the time spent on the decision aid, the pages accessed {{and the use of the}} technology features. Discussion: These study results indicate that information on treatment options, <b>comparative</b> <b>tables</b> and a values clarification tool are key components of a web‐based decision aid for treatment choice of localized prostate cancer in a 65 plus patient group. status: publishe...|$|R
