40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{the development of}} a <b>clinical</b> <b>algorithm</b> to enable standardized intervention prescription and progression for upper limb rehabilitation post stroke. METHODS: We developed a standardized <b>clinical</b> <b>algorithm</b> that involved assessment of 18 critical impairments of upper limb function and application of task-specific exercises appropriate to the level of impairment. These tasks were consistent with recent evidence-based guidelines. We tested the feasibility of the algorithm with 20 participants recently discharged from inpatient rehabilitation following stroke who received outpatient therapy according to the <b>clinical</b> <b>algorithm.</b> Participants' abilities were regularly re-evaluated and task difficulty progressed. Outcomes were assessed at the level of impairment (Action Research Arm Test, Fugl-Meyer Assessment) and activity (Motor Activity Log). RESULTS: All participants attended the 9 sessions of training over the 3 -week intervention period (100 % compliance). No adverse events were reported. There were significant improvements in all outcome measures (P <. 01). CONCLUSIONS: This evidence-based upper limb <b>clinical</b> <b>algorithm</b> provides a framework for standardizing task-specific training following stroke based on the assessment of functioning of the individual following stroke in day-to-day life. This approach is appropriate for patients with different functional levels and may be used to standardize individual or group self-directed practice sessions or to standardize the intervention and progressions in experimental studies.

40|$|Background In 2004, the Netherlands Society of Cardiology {{released}} the current guideline on cardiac rehabilitation. Given its complexity and {{the involvement of}} various healthcare disciplines, it was supplemented with a <b>clinical</b> <b>algorithm,</b> serving to facilitate its implementation in daily practice. Although the algorithm was shown to be effective for improving guideline adherence, several shortcomings and deficiencies were revealed. Based on these findings, the <b>clinical</b> <b>algorithm</b> has now been updated. This article describes {{the process and the}} changes that were made. Methods The revision consisted of three phases. First, the reliability of the measurement instruments included in the 2004 <b>Clinical</b> <b>Algorithm</b> was investigated by evaluating between-centre variations of the baseline assessment data. Second, based on the available evidence, a multidisciplinary expert advisory panel selected items needing revision and provided specific recommendations. Third, a guideline development group decided which revisions were finally included, also taking practical considerations into account. Results A total of nine items were revised: three because of new scientific insights and six because of the need for more objective measurement instruments. In all revised items, subjective assessment methods were replaced by more objective assessment tools (e. g. symptom-limited exercise instead of clinical judgement). In addition, four new key items were added: screening for anxiety/depression, stress, cardiovascular risk profile and alcohol consumption. Conclusion Based on previously determined shortcomings, the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Algorithm</b> for Cardiac Rehabilitation was thoroughly revised mainly by incorporating more objective assessment methods and by adding several new key area...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{test the}} {{diagnostic}} validity of <b>clinical</b> <b>algorithms</b> {{for the detection}} of Chlamydia trachomatis in an urban population of married women in Turkey. DESIGN: Cross-sectional population-based survey. SUBJECTS: A systematic sample of 867 women who reported the use of contraceptive methods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of <b>clinical</b> <b>algorithms</b> for the diagnosis of C trachomatis. RESULTS: C trachomatis was diagnosed in 4. 89 % of the women. The WHO algorithm for use in settings where no vaginal examination could be performed had a sensitivity of 9 % and a specificity of 96 %. The corresponding figures for the WHO algorithm incorporating the findings of a speculum examination were 47 % and 56 % respectively. Algorithms incorporating symptoms or signs other than those suggested by the WHO did not yield satisfactory standards of validity. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study do not support the widespread introduction of the use of clinical decision models for screening of women for chlamydia infection in primary health care settings such as family planning or antenatal clinics.

40|$|This project {{measured}} {{the effect of}} a <b>clinical</b> <b>algorithm</b> on the provision of care to medically uninsured adult patients with type 2 diabetes and a low socioeconomic status (SES). Primary providers often fail to implement established standards for diabetes care to their maximal benefit and do not achieve American Diabetes Association (ADA) treatment standards. Saydah, et al. (2004) reported that only 48 % of patients with diabetes achieved the recommended HbA 1 c goal, and 33 % reached blood pressure and LDL targets. Goals for all three clinical parameters were obtained by only 7 % of patients. The Stetler Model of Evidence-based Practice (EBP) provided the framework for this project. The setting was a primary care clinic for the medically uninsured. Practice patterns for primary care providers were compared to the 2010 ADA standards through chart audits (N = 61). An EBP <b>clinical</b> <b>algorithm</b> was designed and placed within each chart and a focused clinic visit was offered. After three months, a posttest chart audit assessed changes in health care provider practice patterns. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, means, and paired t test describing practice patterns prior to and following implementation of EBP recommendations. All of the 22 process of care standards demonstrated improvement. A pretest audit revealed the mean number of the standards completed was 13. 68 (SD = 5. 15) and posttest audits identified an increase in the mean number to 18. 91 (SD = 4. 91).

40|$|Background: Clinical {{assessment}} of hypotonia is challenging {{due to the}} subjective nature of the initial clinical evaluation. This poses dilemmas for practitioners in gaining accuracy, given that the presentation of hypotonia can be either a non-threatening or malevolent sign. The research question posed was how clinical assessment can be improved, given the current contentions expressed in the scientific literature. Objectives: This paper describes the development and critique of a <b>clinical</b> <b>algorithm</b> to aid the {{assessment of}} hypotonia. Methods: An initial exploratory sequential phase, consisting of a systematic review, a survey amongst clinicians and a Delphi process, assisted {{in the development of}} the algorithm, which is presented within the framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. The ensuing critique followed a qualitative emergent–systematic focus group design with a purposive sample of 59 clinicians. Data were analysed using semantical content analysis and are presented thematically with analytical considerations. Results: This study culminated in the development of an evidence-based <b>clinical</b> <b>algorithm</b> for practice. The qualitative critique of the algorithm considered aspects such as inadequacies, misconceptions and omissions; strengths; clinical use; resource implications; and recommendations. Conclusions: The first prototype and critique of a <b>clinical</b> <b>algorithm</b> to assist the clinical assessment of hypotonia in children has been described. Barriers highlighted include aspects related to knowledge gaps of clinicians, issues around user-friendliness and formatting concerns. Strengths identified by the critique included aspects related to the evidence-based nature of the criteria within the algorithm, the suitability of the algorithm in being merged or extending current practice, the potential of the algorithm in aiding more accurate decision-making, the suitability of the algorithm across age groups and the logical flow. These findings provide a starting point towards ascertaining the clinical utility of the algorithm as an essential step towards evidence-based praxis Keywords: hypotonia; low muscle tone; clinical algorithm; clinical assessment</p...|$|E

Prompted by rising health care costs, careful analysis revealed that the major culprit was {{the variance in the}} delivery of health care. Concerned with outside regulation, health professionals, both in the USA and Canada, are generating clinical guidelines that will serve as templates for the development of standards of care.
