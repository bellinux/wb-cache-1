40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the {{repeated}} confidence interval approach is important because it can guarantee nominal confidence levels for inferences made <b>conditional</b> on <b>stopping.</b> Thus, it provides a method for constructing conditionally acceptable sequential procedures. - 3 -Professors Jennison and Turnbull are to be congratulated for so clearly presenting such an important advance in the topic of sequential analysis. One of the major strengths of their approach is that their interim analyses produce acceptable interim inferences, that is, acceptable inferences <b>conditional</b> on <b>stopping.</b> In many sequential procedures the overall confidence level is not maintained conditionally. It can happen that the conditional confidence level, <b>conditional</b> on <b>stopping</b> early, is uniformly less than the nominal level. (For example, Stein's two- stage confidence interval for a normal mean does not maintain 1 - a coverage if the procedure stops at the first stage, as shown in Casella, 1988.) A strength of the Jennison- Turn bull approach is that the nominal confidence level can be maintained no matter when the procedure stops, a property guaranteed by construction.

The service operated on a tri-weekly schedule, with eastbound trains departing Oakland at 7:57 pm every Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday, and their westbound counterparts leaving Salt Lake City at 7:30 am on the same days. Eastbound, the train's running time was 22 hours and 48 minutes, while westbound it was 23 hours and 30 minutes.

Although the RDCs typically ran the route alone, {{during periods of}} peak demand the Western Pacific ran them in short trains behind an EMD F3, a water tender, and a baggage car. In October 1950, the railroad had computed the direct operating costs for the Zephyrette RDCs at 71 cents per train-mile, almost half the cost incurred by its conventional predecessor, the Royal Gorge. In addition to their relative economic efficiency, the cars also gained a reputation for reliability: one Western Pacific employee even likened one of the RDCs to [...] "a big Buick". They also provided numerous advantages over conventional consists, {{especially in terms of}} their ability to accelerate quickly and maintain high sustained speeds, which allowed for faster service of the route's <b>conditional</b> <b>stops</b> than had previously been possible.

40|$|AbstractThe {{average time}} of {{computing}} Boolean functions by straight-line programs with a <b>conditional</b> <b>stop</b> is considered. A straight-line program consists of operators of two types. Every operator {{of the first}} type computes a binary Boolean function whose arguments are either the values computed by preceding operators or {{the values of the}} input variables. Every operator of the second type either terminates execution of the program or commands that the next operator is executed. A measure of the complexity of such programs is the average execution time over all tuples of the input variables. The complexity of computing almost all complete Boolean functions and almost all partial Boolean functions by such programs is proved to coincide (up to a multiplicative constant) with conventional circuit complexity. Moreover, these complexities are proved to differ (up to a multiplicative constant) by a factor of n for almost all n-place Boolean functions that are equal to 1 on nc tuples. It is proved that there exist Boolean functions of n variables whose average execution time is less (up to a multiplicative constant) by a factor of (2 n/n) 1 / 2 than the time required to compute them by conventional straight-line programs...|$|R

25|$|The Company made it {{very clear}} that {{published}} timetables were only to indicate the times before which a train would not depart and the specified times for each stop were only given as a rough guide. Trains normally made three regular and eight <b>conditional</b> <b>stops,</b> but 'expresses' did run which did not stop between Bideford and Westward Ho!. With two engines in steam the frequency could be every half-hour, but a train every hour or so was the norm in summer, normally taking about 20 minutes from Bideford to Northam or 15 minutes for the 'express'. Fifteen trains ran in each direction in the July 1906 Bideford to Northam timetable and lighter service of four ran on Sundays. The 1910 Bradshaw's Timetable shows trains taking thirty minutes for the journey from Bideford to Appledore, ten trains in each direction, with an extra run on the Market Days (Tuesdays and Saturdays) and no trains on Sundays. The winter timetable for 1 November 1917 to 30 April 1918, which was destined never to be used, was down to seven trains in each direction and no Sunday service. Horse-drawn buses ran from Westward Ho! to Clovelly and through tickets were issued from Instow to cover the journey by ferry, railway and road transport. The bus service cost £51 18s 0d (£51.90) to run for the six months ending 31 December 1906.|$|R

Mobile Ad-Hoc networks are not new to computer science, but the concept of a well organized routing simulator that can demonstrate routing protocols used in Ad-Hoc networks a reality. This simulator will be capable of demonstrating two different routing protocols initially, but will also have the room to expand its capabilities. The simulator will be able to play out many real life scenarios, allowing users to seek out a routing protocol that can optimize the Mobile Ad-Hoc Network experience. While selecting a route, nodes with battery power greater than the threshold will only be considered. It would then go on to compute the minimum power-cost route. We propose an alternative ERS scheme to support reactive and proactive protocols such as DSDV and AODV, and it is called Blocking Expanding Ring Search (Blocking-ERS for short) and also Bellman-Ford algorithm is used as another alternative scheme.

40|$|Patients with work-related upper {{extremity}} pain (WRUED) experience disability {{in daily life}} activities. The factors that influence levels of disability are still unclear. Both excessive avoidance and persistence have been suggested, but the affective and motivational processes that underlie these behaviours have not been scrutinized. This study was aimed at examining the role of current mood and stop rules on physical task performance, controlling for gender, pain severity, pain catastrophizing, and pain-related fear. An additional focus was {{the role of the}} interaction between current mood and stop rules as predicted by the novel Mood-as-Input (MAI) model. Following MAI, it is the informational value of current mood within a goal context (stop rule), rather than mood per se that predicts behaviour. A 2 (mood) x 2 (stop rule) x 2 (physical task order) factorial design was used in which 62 WRUED patients performed an upper and lower extremity physical task. A stress interview was used to induce positive and negative mood. Patients received either an "as-much-as-can (AMAC) " <b>stop</b> rule <b>instruction,</b> or a "feel-like-discontinuing (FLDC) " <b>stop</b> rule <b>instruction.</b> Results showed that physical task performance was predicted by pain-related fear, current mood, stop rule. However, the predicted moodxstop rule interaction was not found, and there was no influence of gender, pain severity, and pain catastrophizing on task performance.

40|$|Imaging {{studies have}} shown that {{response}} inhibition and conflict resolution, key executive functions essential for adaptive behaviour, are mediated by fronto-striatal circuits, specifically the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Overactivity of the STN and underactivation of the pre-SMA are features of Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this thesis was to investigate the hypothesis that the STN is involved in inhibition of action and serves to provide time for reflection and to slow down decision-making under conflict (Frank et al. 2006; 2007). The <b>conditional</b> <b>stop</b> signal reaction time was used. In Study 1, compared to controls, medicated PD patients showed impaired motor inhibition with prolonged stop signal reaction times (SSRTs), problems with conflict resolution, and impairment on tests of cognitive inhibition. In Study 2, PD patients were impaired on motor inhibition and conflict resolution compared to controls both on and off medication. Most importantly, medication status did not influence motor inhibition or conflict resolution in PD. In Study 3, bilateral deep brain stimulation of the STN impaired inhibition as indicated by significantly prolonged SSRTs, but had no significant effect on conflict resolution. However, Study 4, showed that compared to controls and unoperated PD, PD with unilateral subthalamotomies showed faster Go RTs and less conflict-induced slowing but at the expense of greater response selection errors. Finally, Study 5 investigated the contributions of the pre-SMA and IFG to motor inhibition and conflict resolution in healthy controls using transcranial magnetic stimulation. The results confirmed that the contribution of the right pre-SMA to response inhibition is essential. The results are consistent with the proposal that the STN and pre-SMA are involved in reactive inhibition and that the STN together with the pre-SMA influences the response threshold and speed-accuracy trade-offs. ...|$|R
40|$|Taxiing at {{any major}} hub airport {{constitutes}} a workload intense navigation and monitoring. Although the pilots {{are supported by}} signage on the airport surface and possibly even taxiway centerline lights, this task can be complicated even in good weather conditions. Radio communication technology is near capacity limits in many airports today resulting in waiting times for the flight crew to negotiate the next taxi clearance. Apart from well known safety issues this often leads to delays - for the passengers as well - and ultimately impacts the environment. Solutions are given by the European research program SESAR (Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research) which aims at modernizing and harmonizing the European Aviation network. A new surface traffic management concept dispenses with radio communication and proposes the automated use of AGL with individually switched green taxiway centerline lights indicating the path for the flight crew to be followed. For each aircraft a segment of taxiway centerline lights can be illuminated in front of it. The areas not needed are switched off, minimizing the risk of errors. The new concept is independent from cockpit equipment. The procedure is called “Follow-the-Greens”. The SESAR European Airports Consortium “SEAC” validated the new concept {{under the leadership of}} Fraport with its partners DFS, ENAV, Flightdecksystems and ATRiCS under the support of Lufthansa in 2013. A real-time simulation platform for the Frankfurt airport area layout combined two Airbus A 320 fixed based simulators with highly integrated controller working positions. The concept’s effect on taxi times and route deviation was examined. The appropriate length of the green line, different ways of (de-) activating the lights and different visualizations of a <b>stop</b> <b>instruction</b> were tested.
