50|$|Coxen's fig parrot (<b>Cyclopsitta</b> <b>diophthalma</b> <b>coxeni),</b> {{also known}} as the blue-browed, red-faced or {{southern}} fig parrot or lorilet, is one of the smallest and least known Australian parrots.

50|$|Previous logging of {{rainforest}} and woodland in the Noosa {{region has}} led to habitat loss and fragmentation for many bird species, particularly for the black-breasted button-quail (Turnix melanogaster), Coxen’s fig-parrot (<b>Cyclopsitta</b> <b>diophthalma</b> <b>coxeni),</b> glossy black-cockatoo (Calyptohynchus lathami erebus), and the swift parrot (Lathamus discolor). Previous clearing of eucalypt forests has also affected the primary food source and habitat of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus).|$|R
50|$|The Noosa Biosphere Reserve {{is a vital}} {{element of}} the BirdLife International {{designated}} Endemic Bird Area (EBA) Eastern Australia zone. The reserve houses over 300 bird species, with a dynamic and diverse population encompassing 44% of documented Australian resident bird species population, as well as migratory bird species. Significant species in the area include the square-tailed kite (Lophoictinia isura), red goshawk (Erythrotriorchis radiates), black-breasted button-quail (Turnix melanogaster), glossy black cockatoo (Calyptohynchus lathami erebus), Coxen’s fig parrot (<b>Cyclopsitta</b> <b>diophthalma</b> <b>coxeni),</b> swift parrot (Lathamus discolor), eastern ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus wallicus), and the regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus).|$|R
50|$|The {{woodlands}} in the Noosa Biosphere Reserve {{provide an}} ideal habitat {{for many of}} the bird species mentioned. The glossy black cockatoo (Calyptohynchus lathami erebus) is especially reliant on large woodland tree hollows for breeding. This particular species is currently listed as vulnerable in Queensland, as is the black breasted button-quail (Turnix melanogaster), and the eastern ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus wallicus). Species with significantly small populations and recognised as endangered by Queensland Government are the red goshawk (Erythrotriorchis radiates), Coxen’s fig parrot (<b>Cyclopsitta</b> <b>diophthalma</b> <b>coxeni),</b> and the swift parrot (Lathamus discolor).|$|R

5|$|The double-eyed fig parrot (<b>Cyclopsitta</b> <b>diophthalma)</b> {{eats the}} fruit of Ficus obliqua, {{steadily}} depositing fruity detritus on the ground. The rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus) is another parrot that consumes the fruit and disperses the seeds; other Australian bird species include the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius), brown cuckoo-dove (Macropygia phasianella), rose-crowned fruit dove (Ptilinopus regina), wompoo fruit dove (P. magnificus), wonga pigeon (Leucosarcia melanoleuca), topknot pigeon (Lopholaimus antarcticus), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), black-faced cuckoo-shrike (Coracina novaehollandae), olive-backed oriole (Oriolus sagittatus), Australasian figbird (Sphecotheres vieilloti), green catbird (Ailuroedus crassirostris), regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), and Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii). The tree is an important food source for the western Polynesian species the many-coloured fruit dove (Ptilinopus perousii) and crimson-crowned fruit dove (P. porphyraceus), and has been recommended for amenity planting in Tonga for these birds. The spectacled flying fox (Pteropus conspicillatus) and grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) also eat the fruit.|$|R
