40|$|There is a {{necessity}} to provide an immobilization of the long-lived radioactive waste into radiation-resistant structure (a cement matrix, <b>container</b> <b>capsule,</b> geological disposal environment and so on) for it safely disposal. The material of the every of these barriers should have resistance corresponding to the absorbed dose value up to 10 ⁸ Gy {{for the period of}} time up to 1000 years. The method of imitation exposure of the materials under bremsstrahlung of the high-current Linac was developed for prediction behavior and material selection. For realization of this method {{in a wide range of}} exposure conditions (by temperature, humidity, rate and amount of the doze) the special target unit was designed. It has a modular construction and includes two chambers for samples (one for exposure in liquid and another one – in the atmosphere) that are placed along the irradiation axis and integrated together spatially. Also, the target unit has plane-parallel ionization chamber for continuous monitoring of the photon flux intensity and absorbed doze. The copper thermistor is used as a temperature probe. The structure and characteristics of measurement channels are described as well...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to directly compare two distinctly diverse package moisture permeation test methods. The two methods that were compared were the USP 3 ̆c 6713 ̆e Containers Permeation: Single Unit Container and Unit Dose <b>Containers</b> for <b>Capsules</b> and Tablets and the MOCON Modulated Infrared Sensor Method (ASTM F 1249). The tests generate a value known as an MVTR (Moisture Vapor Transmission Rate) value. The focus {{of this study was to}} determine whether there is a significant statistical difference between results of the two methods, specifically for unit dose blister packaging. Since MVTR is a package integrity characteristic, it is particularly important to the pharmaceutical industry because of the FDA regulations that govern packaging materials and components. After four different pharmaceutical grade packaging materials were evaluated and analyzed, the statistical results show that there is a significant difference between the two test methods. However it was discovered that due to lack of sensitivity of testing equipment, the statistical data analysis might be suspect...|$|R

At present time it is supposed, that bucky shuttles can be used, for example, as nanosized memory elements [5] or {{to serve as a}} basis for creating devices for target drug delivery [6]. One of the most promising directions of nanocapsule usage is its exploitation as a nanoscale <b>container</b> or a <b>capsule</b> for different gases storage [7 – 11], because conventional nanotubes cannot meet the requirements of industrial use, in spite of having numerous special improvements in their structure [12 – 14]. Using nanostructured carbon engineering [15 – 17], opens new prospects for creating nanocapsules of complex structural forms.|$|R

5000|$|A {{successful}} {{technique for}} germinating white beech is to collect new purple fruit. Cut off the fleshy aril. Place the wooden [...] "nut" [...] {{in the sun}} for a few days. When cracks appear around the emerging seed compartments, place it in a large <b>container.</b> Ensure the <b>capsule</b> receives adequate moisture and warmth in the cooler months. Trying to open the hard nut {{in the middle of}} the fruit, or hitting the capsule with a hammer has proven useless. The best technique appears to be the removal of the outer blue/purple flesh. Then exposing the inner capsule to sunlight and moisture. The sunlight cracks the outer covering of the capsule. The moisture seeps through the outer shell, affecting the inner seed. When the seed is germinated, it pushes open the cells of the capsule. The majority of capsules will not produce seedlings. A large quantity of capsules is advised for propagation.|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores a {{new class}} of {{hierarchical}} containers that are formed via single-step assembly, and at a later time, self-destruct due to their packaged contents. These <b>containers</b> are spherical <b>capsules</b> formed by electrostatic complexation of the anionic biopolymer, gellan gum with the cationic biopolymer, chitosan. The capsules are termed "motherships", and are engineered to carry a payload of much smaller containers, i. e., nanoscale vesicles ("babyships"), within its lumen. By also packaging an enzyme, chitosanase, inside the capsule, we create "motherships" that self-destruct, releasing their payload of "babyships" in a pulsatile manner. The timescale for self-destruction can be engineered based on the internal concentration of enzyme. The "motherships" are stable when stored in a freeze-dried form and can be readily dispersed into buffer solutions at a later time, whereupon their "internal clock" for self-destruction is initiated. The above concept could be useful for the controlled release of a variety of payloads including drugs, biological therapeutics, cosmetics, or flavor ingredients...|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} types of {{power-up}} capsules that the player can retrieve by destroying certain floating <b>containers.</b> The red <b>capsules</b> will increase the player character's attack power by allowing him to create body images of himself that will mimic his movement. The main character's attack power can {{be determined by the}} color of his pants. In his starting level, the character's pants will be blue, which changed to purple with the first power-up (allowing him to create one body image), followed by red (two body images) and white (four body images). The strongest attack level is black, which increases the player character's attack range. If the player takes damage from an enemy Osman's attack power will be reduced by one level. Other power-up items include a green power-up that restores one health point, a yellow power-up that increases the maximum health by one point, and a blue power-up that restores the player's complete health.|$|R
40|$|Protein {{microspheres}} {{have been}} prepared by sonicating a mixture of pure fragrant oil (amyl acetate (AA)) with an aqueous protein (bovine serum albumin) solution. The prepared protein spheres are nano- to micrometer sized with an encapsulation efficiency of approx. 97 % for the AA present {{on the surface and}} inside the BSA <b>capsule.</b> <b>Containers</b> were found stable for more than 6 months when stored sealed at 4 °C and 20 °C. For the release profile measurements, we used a simple, automated and direct method. We continuously weighed the encapsulated microspheres and measured the evaporation rates. The release profiles at 15 °C and 25 °C display two different evaporation rates. The higher rate is the sum of a few evaporation rates, including water molecules, while the slower rate is due to the evaporation of pure AA. The changes in the evaporation rates occur upon the collapse of the container. This event coincides with the full evaporation of water. For morphological characterization we dyed the AA with Nile red, and used SEM, ESEM, Cryo-SEM, light microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy measurements...|$|R
40|$|Mesoporous nanocompartment films {{composed}} of silica particles and hollow silica capsules were {{prepared by the}} layer-by-layer (LbL) technique. The resulting mesoporous nanocompartment films possess special molecular encapsulation and release capabilities so that stimuli-free auto-modulated stepwise release of water or drug molecules was achieved through the mesopore channels of robust silica <b>capsule</b> <b>containers</b> embedded in the film. Stepwise release of water was reproducibly observed that originates in the non-equilibrated rates between evaporation {{of water from the}} mesopore channels to the exterior and the capillary penetration of water from container interior to the mesopore channels. It was generalized to evaporation of other substances, fragrances, limonene. Application was also tested in the controlled release of the sunscreen UV-absorber (UV-S 1) for circumvention of its rapid dissolution in water and prolongation of its prophylactic effect toward harmful ultraviolet radiation. UV-S 1 was successfully entrapped within the mesoporous nanocompartment films and was released in a prolonged stepwise mode. The nanocompartment films developed in this research are promising materials for drug delivery since they allow gradual release of therapeutic agents with likely related improvements in their efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic capsule {{pipelines}} (HCPs) are {{the third}} generation pipelines transporting hollow <b>containers,</b> known as <b>capsules.</b> These capsules are filled with material/cargo to be transported. The shape of these capsules has {{a significant effect on}} the hydrodynamic flow characteristics within HCPs. As the variations in the pressure distribution within HCPs are directly linked to and the flow characteristics within pipelines, it is essential to critically evaluate the effect of capsule shape on the pressure drop across the pipeline. Published literature is severely limited in terms of establishing the effects of the shape of the capsules on the flow characteristics within pipelines. Hence, the present study focuses on using a well-validated Computational Fluid Dynamics tool to numerically simulate the flow of capsules of various shapes quantified in form of a novel shape factor in hydraulic capsule pipelines. Both on-shore and off-shore applications of such pipelines have been investigated in the present study, along-with pipe fittings, such as bends. Variations in flow related parameters within these pipelines have been discussed in detail {{for a wide range of}} geometrical parameters associated with the capsules and the pipelines. Pressure drop values have been used to develop novel semi-empirical prediction models as a function of the shape factor and other flow and geometric variables of the capsules. These prediction models have been embedded into a pipeline optimisation methodology, which has been developed based on Least-Cost Principle. The resulting novel optimisation methodology can be used for hydraulic capsule pipeline design. Performance charts for practical applications have been developed for easy implementation of the design methodology for the designers of hydraulic capsule pipelines transporting capsule of different shapes...|$|R
30|$|The {{interface}} board is fully {{connected to the}} Overo-board through two 70 -pin AVX 5602 series connectors. Moreover, the {{interface board}} provides 4 generic USB ports and regulates stable electric power from batteries to supply all devices in the HPMS. Extra sensors {{can be added to}} the HPMS through USB ports, or through extension boards stacked on top of the interface board. The McRAIT controller integrates the SkyeModule M 10 UHF module [37] and a redundant array of independent tags (RAIT) software. The SkyeModule M 10 reader module has up to 5 m of communication range in maximum scan mode (1.5 mA, 30 db). Since the mobile sensors (and the RFID readers) are operated for a very short time (only in the inspection time), the power should not be the issue for the reader (and also for HPMS). However, if the reader (and HPMS) needs to operate for a relatively long time, it can perform power control and noise reduction through a power management policy of HPMS which allows the reader to be in idle and active scan mode. The idle mode duration for the reader can be adjusted by the travel velocity of HPMS during pipeline inspection so that power can be managed optimally. This adjustment is possible since HPMS can estimate travel distance/time between the detected tag and the next tag in its way based on the travel speed calculated by the values provided by an accelerometer sensor. The SkyeModule M 10 reader also provides a library, called SkyeAPI, that simplifies and automates the RFID tag and protocol-specific functions. Lastly, two types of containers are used within the HPMS to protect the whole device from external hazards and provide floating capabilities. The two types are the <b>capsule</b> <b>container</b> and the spherical container. The overall dimension of a container does not exceed 80 mm, making the HPMS usable in small size pipelines. However, it can have a larger size for more intensive functions, when used in larger sized pipelines.|$|R
40|$|From Jello to {{mayonnaise}} to silly putty to biological cells, {{our world}} {{is replete with}} "soft matter" - materials that behave as soft, deformable solids or highly viscoelastic liquids. Living systems, in particular, {{can be thought of}} as extremely sophisticated `soft' machines, with each cellular unit representing a touchstone for the functional potential of soft materials built via self-assembly. Drawing inspiration from biology, we blueprint soft biomaterial designs which rely upon self-assembly to achieve enhanced functionality. As opposed to complex synthesis schemes often used to develop improved biomaterials, we take an `easy' approach by allowing relatively simple molecules orchestrate themselves into advanced machines. In this dissertation, we describe four separate "soft" systems, all constructed by self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules under designed and/or triggered conditions in aqueous media. These systems revolve around a common theme: the structural tandem of (1) vesicles and (2) biopolymers, and the resulting interactions between the two. Our blueprints show promise in several important biomedical applications including controlled drug release, tissue engineering, and wound care. In the first part of this study, we blueprint a biopolymer gel that entraps pH-sensitive vesicles. The vesicles are formed by the self-assembly of a single-tailed fatty acid surfactant. We show that the gel has pH-responsive properties imparted upon it via the embedded vesicle nanostructures. Specifically, when the gel is brought in contact with a high pH buffer, the diffusion of buffer into the gel disrupts the vesicles and transforms them into micelles. Accordingly, a vesicle-micelle front moves through the gel, and this can be visually seen by a difference in color. The disruption of vesicles means that their encapsulated solutes are released into the bulk gel, and in turn these solutes can rapidly diffuse out of the gel. Thus, we can use pH to tune the release rate of model drug molecules from these vesicle-loaded gels into the external solution. In the second part, we have blueprinted hybrid biopolymer capsules containing drug-loaded vesicles by means of a one-step self-assembly process. These capsules are called "motherships" as each unit features a larger <b>container,</b> the polymer <b>capsule,</b> carrying a payload of smaller vesicular containers, or "babyships," within its lumen. These motherships are self-assembled via electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged polymers/surfactants at the interface of the droplet. Capsule size is simply dictated by drop size, and capsules of sizes 200 - 5000 µm are produced here. Lipid vesicles, i. e. the babyships, are retained inside motherships due to the diffusional barrier created by the capsule shell. The added transport barrier provided by the vesicle bilayer in addition to the capsule shell provides sustained drug release from the motherships. Furthermore, this one-step drop method allows for the rapid synthesis of soft materials exhibiting structural features over a hierarchy of length scales, from nano-, to micro- to macro-. Thirdly, we have therapeutically functionalized biopolymer films by simply passing a solution of vesicles over the film surface. We deposit films of an associating biopolymer onto patterned solid substrates. Subsequently, these polymer films are able to spontaneously capture therapeutically-loaded vesicles from solution; this is demonstrated both for surfactant as well as lipid vesicles (liposomes). Importantly, it is verified that the vesicles are intact - this is shown both by direct visualization of captured vesicles (via optical and cryo-transmission electron microscopy) as well as through the capture and subsequent disruption of drug filled vesicles. Such therapeutically-functionalized films may be of use in the treatment of chronic wounds and burns. Lastly, we have demonstrated that the addition of a certain biopolymer transforms a suspension of whole blood into a gel. This blueprint is inspired from previous research in our group on the biopolymer-induced gelation of vesicles, which are structurally similar to cells. Upon mixture with heparinized human whole blood, this amphilic biopolymer rapidly forms into an "artificial clot. " These mixtures have highly elastic character, with the mixtures able to hold their own weight upon vial inversion. Moreover, the biopolymer shows significant hemorrhage-controlling efficacy in animal injury models. Such biopolymer-cell gelation processes are shown to be reversed via introduction of an amphiphilic supramolecule, thus introducing the novel concept of the "revesible hemostat. " Such a hemostatic functionality may be of large and unprecedented use in clinical the treatment of problematic hemorrhage both in trauma and routine surgeries...|$|R
