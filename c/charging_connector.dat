50|$|Likewise, only {{second to}} the BMW i3 REx, the 53 mi all-electric range is the second longest-range {{achieved}} by any plug-in hybrid car available for sale. Chevrolet expects that many 2016 Volt owners will run on battery only for 90% of their daily trips, up from 80% for the first generation owners based on OnStar data and other studies. To increase the electrically driven miles, the Volt would need better charging capabilities. The Volt's onboard charger can only handle 3.6 kW though, which is sufficient for overnight charging at the owner's home but falls short of the capabilities of public chargers. The Volt also lacks a DC quick <b>charging</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|E

Two weeks later BMW has opened its first CCS rapid charge station in support of the upcoming BMW i3. On occasion of the second EV World Summit in June 2013 both a Chademo and a Volkswagen-group spokesperson have pointed out that a concurrency between Chademo and CCS is not required as the additional cost of a dual-protocol rapid charge station is a mere 5% - thus multi-standard DC chargers are being advocated by Chademo, Volkswagen and Nissan.|$|R
5000|$|The {{revival of}} {{interest}} in electric cars brought about {{a need for a}} recharging network.

The standardization in the IEC 62196 for higher current <b>charging</b> <b>connectors</b> brought about different systems with Type 1 being used primarily in Northern America and Japan and variants of Type 2 being used elsewhere. The SAE and ACEA want to avoid a similar situation for outstanding standardization of DC charging - they developed the plan to add common DC wires to the existing AC connector types such {{that there is only one}} [...] "global envelope" [...] that fits all DC charging stations.|$|R

5000|$|The {{target of}} only having one <b>charging</b> <b>connector</b> is {{currently}} unlikely to occur.

The SAE and ACEA are trying to avoid the situation for DC charging with a standardization that plans to add DC wires to the existing AC connector types such that there is only one [...] "global envelope" [...] that fits all DC charging stations - for Type 2 the new housing is named Combo 2.|$|E
5000|$|SAE is {{developing}} a Combo Coupler variant of the J1772-2009 connector with additional pins to accommodate fast DC charging at 200-450 volts DC and up to 90 kW.

Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Porsche, Volvo and Volkswagen) had agreed to introduce the [...] "Combined Charging System" [...] in mid-2012. The first vehicles using the SAE Combo plug were the BMW i3 released in late 2013, and the Chevrolet Spark EV released in 2014.
