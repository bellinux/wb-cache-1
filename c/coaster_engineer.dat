2500|$|Lightning was {{a wooden}} roller coaster that {{operated}} from 1927 until 1933 at Revere Beach in Revere, Massachusetts. It {{was one of}} the infamous Giant Cyclone Safety Coasters which were constructed by noted roller <b>coaster</b> <b>engineer</b> Harry G. Traver in the mid-1920s (the rides were, in fact, anything but safe, and became known as the [...] "terrifying triplets" [...] The Lightning was not the only roller coaster at Revere Beach with a poor safety record, however. Derby Racer, for example, killed or critically injured at least 5 people in its 25 years of operation.|$|E
50|$|Keenan joined National Amusement Devices in {{the late}} 1930s and served as chief <b>coaster</b> <b>engineer.</b> During this period he designed, among others, the Atom Smasher at Rockaway Playland, a coaster {{featured}} extensively in the 1952 movie This Is Cinerama. He also designed the Comet at Lincoln Park, which opened in 1946.|$|E
25|$|Disneyland Paris also {{features}} an Indiana Jones-titled ride where people speed off through ancient ruins in a runaway mine wagon {{similar to that}} found in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril is a looping roller <b>coaster</b> <b>engineered</b> by Intamin, designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, and opened in 1993.|$|R
50|$|The {{attraction}} employs {{several instances}} {{of new technology}} developed by Walt Disney Imagineering, the key being two large digital video projection effects in the early dark ride scenes of the ride, which place Nemo, the clownfish, and Squirt, Crush's son, seamlessly within the 'underwater' environment. The technology was developed for Crush's Coaster in conjunction with Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage and The Seas with Nemo and Friends. Crush's Coaster marks the only second Disney-themed spinning roller coaster (following Primeval Whirl), and the first ever collaboration between German roller <b>coaster</b> <b>engineers</b> Maurer Söhne and Walt Disney Imagineering.|$|R
5000|$|Originally named [...] "The Bobs", the coaster {{was best}} known by its later name of Thunderbolt. It was {{designed}} by noted roller <b>coaster</b> <b>engineers</b> Frank Prior and Frederick Church and built by the Traver Engineering Company. The coaster was built approximately 500 ft out onto Liberty Pier in Long Island Sound and could be easily seen from {{up and down the}} beach and from several nearby piers. It was quite popular, financially successful, and is thought to have driven at least one other nearby coaster out of business.|$|R
50|$|Lina Beecher (January 2, 1841 - October 5, 1915) was an American {{inventor}} and roller <b>coaster</b> <b>engineer.</b> Beecher is {{best known}} for building the first looping roller coaster in North America, which was known as the Flip Flap Railway, and a later looping roller coaster known as Loop the Loop. He is also known for designing a number of other inventions and patents with a variety of applications.|$|E
50|$|The Airplane Coaster was {{designed}} by noted roller <b>coaster</b> <b>engineer</b> Frederick Church. For many years it was believed, based on past collaborations and similar design, that Harry Traver of Traver Engineering had built the coaster, but in the 1980s {{it was determined that}} Traver was not the builder. A researcher digging through a Rye, New York attic, discovered plans that listed the actual builder as Frank W. Darling, the owner of LaMarcus Adna Thompson's construction company.|$|E

Designed by Don Rosser & Associates and renowned <b>coaster</b> <b>engineer</b> Bill Cobb, the ride cost $2.3 million to {{construct}} using over a half-million feet of Douglas fir lumber. With 3340 ft of track and speeds originally up to 60 mph, it was billed as [...] "the South's longest and fastest roller coaster" [...] by the park.

50|$|Developed by J. Norman Bartlett and John Miller, the Flying Turns {{coasters}} came to {{the attention}} of PTC. Recognizing the ride's potential, PTC signed a licensing agreement with Bartlett and Miller to market the ride in North America—with the exception of the state of California. With the arrival of the Great Depression, PTC built only one in 1931, at Rocky Point Amusement Park. The <b>coaster</b> was <b>engineered</b> by Herbert Schmeck, but experienced problems. The ride opened late in the summer and Schmeck was required to stay on site for some time before he was able to get the ride operating consistently. The ride was damaged beyond repair by a storm on September 21, 1938.|$|R
50|$|The Golden Nugget Mine Ride {{opened in}} July 1960 at Morey's Piers on the newly {{constructed}} ocean side section of Hunt's Pier. The Golden Nugget was built three stories high {{with the top}} floor giving riders a mine car ride through the “desert.” The coaster was specially constructed for Hunt’s Pier by the Philadelphia Toboggan <b>Coasters</b> and was <b>engineered</b> by John C. Allen. Bill Tracy designed the ride’s western theme pieces through his Amusement Display company.On December 11, 2008, Morey's Piers announced that the Golden Nugget would be demolished {{and that they would}} have a ceremony for the Golden Nugget on Saturday, January 31. On Jan 26, 2009 it was publicly announced that Knoebels' Amusement Resort had purchased the Golden Nugget track and trains from Morey's Piers. The Coaster was modified and rebuilt on the location where the park's former bald eagle habitat resides. The eagle's habitat has been relocated. The Black Diamond has opened and is currently working as of October 8, 2011.|$|R

Traver in the mid-1920s (the rides were, in fact, anything but safe, and became known as the [...] "terrifying triplets"). Lightning was the only Giant Cyclone Safety Coaster not to bear the [...] "Cyclone" [...] name, as a roller coaster named Cyclone already existed at Revere Beach when Lightning was constructed in 1927. The other two members of this group of coasters included the Crystal Beach Cyclone and the Palisades Park Cyclone (A fourth Traver roller coaster named Zip had a similar—but smaller—design and was installed at Oaks Amusement Park in Portland, Oregon).|$|E
5000|$|Until 1897, {{there was}} no {{established}} fairground on the island apart from a few carousels run by Bavarian showman Jacob Studt, a set of swing-boats hand-made by Sydney White of Cardiff and a playground slide {{set up on the}} main beach for each summer season. In that year the first major ride attraction was built. A Switchback Railway had been designed and built by the famous American <b>coaster</b> <b>engineer</b> LaMarcus Thompson specially for the Cardiff Empire Exhibition at Sophia Gardens in 1896, dismantled following the year-long exhibition and put up for sale. It was bought by the White family and installed at the western end of the beach edge on the present day site of The Olde Pavilion Café (named after the Pavilion Theatre, which had been situated amongst the sand-dunes). Barry Athletic Club's car park now stands where the Switchback ride ended.|$|E
