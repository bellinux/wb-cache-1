40|$|Integral C ’ is an {{industrial}} grade integrated programming environment for C programming cm an engineering workstation. A single interactive tool replaces a syntax checking editor, a compiler, and a source-level debugger. Its multi-window user interface allows program editing and animated source level debugging, {{tailored to the}} needs of a C programmff. The compiler accepts standard C code and reacts to editing changes with function-level incremental <b>compilation.</b> <b>Compilation</b> is done without prompting to maintain the client program in a ready-to-run state. Emitted code is instrumented to catch run-time errors and to permit fine grained &bugging. Debugging support code is written in C in a ‘workspace’, which grants it direct access to a local scope while keeping it separate from the client program. ...|$|E
40|$|Singleton kinds {{provide an}} elegant device for expressing type {{equality}} information resulting from modern module languages, {{but they can}} complicate the metatheory of languages in which they appear. I present a translation from a language with singleton kinds to one without, and prove that translation to be sound and complete. This translation is useful for type-preserving compilers generating typed target languages. The proof of soundness and completeness is done by normalizing type equivalence derivations using Stone and Harper's type equivalence decision procedure. 1 Introduction Type-preserving <b>compilation,</b> <b>compilation</b> using statically typed intermediate languages, offers many compelling advantages over conventional untyped compilation. A typed compiler can utilize type information to enable optimizations {{that would otherwise be}} prohibitively difficult or impossible. Internal type checking can be used to help debug a compiler by catching errors introduced into programs in optimizati [...] ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is hard to}} use {{properties}} of memory locations in functional languages. One such property is that memory locations are unique identifiers of objects, i. e., two objects are equal {{if they have the}} same memory address. I introduce a syntactic sugar called new in a pure functional language. new provides easy-to-use unique identifiers for expressions. I show moreover that if we use graph rewriting during the <b>compilation,</b> <b>compilation</b> ofnew can be optimised such that the final imperative code use memory locations for identification. Finally I give a prototype implementation of the language in Clean with ABC code. The introduced syntactic sugar can be expressed in the ν-calculus. The difference is that identifiers are hidden bynew and the usage ofnew is forced to be more explicit by a so-called new-propagation rule. Due to this two restrictions,new fits better in functional programming than the ν-calculus. ...|$|E

40|$|The project {{investigates the}} use of Abstract State Machine {{in the process of}} {{computer}} program <b>compilation.</b> <b>Compilation</b> is to produce machine-code from a source program written in a high-level language. A compiler is a program written for the purpose. Machine-code is the computer-readable representation of sequences of computer instructions. An Abstract State Machine (ASM) is a notional computing machine, developed by Yuri Gurevich, for accurately and easily representing the semantics of algorithms. It is a development of the Turing machine. A Turing machine is an abstract machine invoked in theories of computability and automata, that can perform simple reading, writing and shifting operations according to a finite set of rules, upon an infinite tape. In the project the expressive power of ASM is used to capture the semantics of the programming language Scheme according to a particular model, and to take advantage of ASM's simple form in the process of compilation. The semantic model is The Environment Model for Evaluation described by Abelson and Sussman in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. Attention is given to the process of parsing the Scheme code, to derive its structure, and the representation of this structure using ASM...|$|E
40|$|Senior High School (SMA) is {{a school}} that {{provides}} French language lessons to students majoring in natural sciences and social sciences. There are also high schools that open special French class for students and some schools put French as a lesson for extra-curricular activities. From {{the analysis of the}} textbooks used by high school teachers, it is concluded that the textbooks / instructional materials that they use are less up to date and some are using <b>compilation</b> (<b>compilation</b> of texts drawn from various sources). Language teaching materials in the European Union are already equipped with Portfolio Européen des Langues (PEL) and of the literature found, PEL provides many benefits to learning foreign language. The benefit of PEL is not only for teachers but also for students. The above mentioned have been the reason to conduct this study, developing French teaching materials in high schools that integrate P ortfolio Européen des langues (PEL) for French language learners in Indonesia. To initiate this study, the analysis of textbooks used by several high schools in Jakarta and surrounding areas had been conducted. Furthermore, it is then continued with the analysis of the needs of the PEL. To obtain the necessary data, this study uses interview questionnaire. The next step is to arrange French language teaching materials prototype for high school that integrates PEL. The prototype is reviewed by two experts in their field and have been revised, and then limited trials for high schools are conducted.   How to Cite Ekowati, S. H., & Purbarini, A. (2016).
