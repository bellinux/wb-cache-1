5|$|Berkshire No. 7 is a {{wood and}} steel barge {{constructed}} in 1935. It is historically {{important as a}} transitional <b>canal</b> <b>barge</b> and {{as one of the}} few surviving wooden-hulled canal boats. It was used to transport bulk cargo, including shipping fertilizer, from Connecticut to Long Island Sound. It sank in 1974 along with the Elmer S. Dailey and the Priscilla Dailey in the harbor of Bridgeport, Connecticut on the west side of the Pequonnock River. The sunken vessel has deteriorated to the point that a salvage operation could result in breaking it apart. The Berkshire No. 7 was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978.|$|E

25|$|High {{above the}} city, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania built the South Fork Dam between 1838 and 1853, {{as part of}} a cross-state canal system, the Main Line of Public Works. Johnstown was the eastern {{terminus}} of the Western Division Canal, supplied with water by Lake Conemaugh, the reservoir behind the dam. As railroads superseded <b>canal</b> <b>barge</b> transport, the Commonwealth abandoned the canal and sold it to the Pennsylvania Railroad. The dam and lake were part of the purchase, and the railroad sold them to private interests.|$|E
25|$|Its {{location}} {{during the}} early westward expansion of the United States, on an international border and in a fertile farming region, has contributed to a rich cultural and economic history. Two world religions sprung from within its borders, and its inhabitants played important roles in abolitionism in the {{years leading up to}} the American Civil War. Nineteenth century War of 1812 skirmishes, Great Lakes sailing ship commerce and Erie <b>Canal</b> <b>barge</b> traffic have yielded to contemporary recognition as one of the world's most productive fruit growing regions.

25|$|The caisson lock can however be powered, and the caisson lifted, by {{buoyancy}} alone. Pumping {{ballast water}} {{in and out}} of the caisson is enough to float it up or down the lock chamber. The weight of ballast water is approximately that of the <b>canal</b> <b>barge</b> being lifted. The boat lift though needs a mechanical lift system. In most vertical lift systems, this must also lift or lower the weight of the caisson and its water contents as well. This is substantially more than the barge alone, and the power to lift it is supplied mechanically. At the time of their development, the steam engine was in its infancy. Steam engines had been developed as water pumps, but not yet for the supply of mechanical power (see rotative steam engine). Given the engineering constraints of the time, lifting an enclosed caisson by buoyancy was more practical than driving a boat lift.|$|E

Clouette describes the hull as being [...] "nearly rectangular in profile, section and plan, with squared-off stern and bluntly rounded bow. Low bulwarks with scuppers rise slightly to a peak where they join the prominently projecting stem". The superstructure is primarily of a single low coaming with convex hatch covers that runs almost the full length of the shop. A rectangular cabin rises up above the coaming and has a companionway in the rear. The Berkshire No. 7 is listed in the U.S. Registry as #172071.|$|E

[...] By 1797, the Grand Junction Canal (now called the Grand Union Canal) was being cut. [...] Its highest point is the Tring Summit in Hertfordshire, which was formed in 1799. [...] Because a <b>canal</b> <b>barge</b> can hold so much more than a wagon, the waterways expansions increased the quantity of supplies that could reach London (and the amount of refuse and manure that could be carted away).|$|E

The design of the [...] (Siegfried Position, later known by the Allied powers as the Hindenburg Line) was drawn up by Colonel Kraemer, an engineer from supreme headquarters (OHL) and General Lauter, the Inspector General of Artillery. Construction was organised by Rupprecht and Kuhl; when the plans were ready the line was divided into sectors and officers from the General Staff, gunners and engineers were appointed to oversee construction, which was expected to take five months. The defences were built by German construction companies, who brought skilled workmen to fabricate ferro concrete emplacements, while [...] and [...] labourers and [...] Russian prisoners of war dug the trenches. The building works absorbed most of the cement, sand and gravel production of occupied France and Belgium plus that of west Germany. Transport of materials was conducted by <b>canal</b> <b>barge</b> and railway, which carried [...] of engineering stores, although the building period from October 1916 to March 1917 meant that only about eight trains a day were added to normal traffic. Mass-production techniques were used to produce items for the position. Steel-reinforced concrete dug-outs for infantry squads and artillery-observation posts were standard designs and all woodwork was made to a pattern.|$|E

60|$|He found, {{on going}} down to the shore three hours later, that the boatmen were engaged in {{covering}} in the whole of the craft, {{with the exception of a}} few feet at each end, with a roof of rushes.

60|$|Of all {{the creatures}} of {{commercial}} enterprise, a <b>canal</b> <b>barge</b> {{is by far}} the most delightful to consider. It may spread its sails, and then you see it sailing high above the tree-tops and the windmill, sailing on the aqueduct, sailing through the green corn-lands: the most picturesque of things amphibious. Or the horse plods along at a foot-pace as if there were no such thing as business in the world; and the man dreaming at the tiller sees the same spire on the horizon all day long. It is a mystery how things ever get to their destination at this rate; and to see the barges waiting their turn at a lock, affords a fine lesson of how easily the world may be taken. There should be many contented spirits on board, for such a life is both to travel and to stay at home.|$|E

Today, the system is served by several commercial towing companies.
