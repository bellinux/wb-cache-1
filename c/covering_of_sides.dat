40|$|The {{assembly}} process <b>of</b> the <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> <b>side</b> members {{is the most}} defective process at the Plant Consolidation Center in Malsch. The difficulty is {{the high level of}} variance, the manual process control and that the components do not have a barcode. Since the labelling with a barcode is out of the question, an innovative process assurance for non system-based components by an automated photo documentation and photo plausibility should be found. The following specific questions have been posed: 1. What are the main sources of error in this process? 2. What innovative possibilities do exist to eliminate these main sources of error? 3. Is the installation of a process assurance technologically possible and economically efficient? The main sources of error have been identified by an error analysis. These are: Taking out the right colour and variation <b>of</b> the <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> <b>side</b> members, the assembly of the right or no trim and the right positioning of the components in the carrier of charge. The study concluded that the necessary functions of the innovative process assurance are the recognition of the colour and variation <b>of</b> the <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> <b>side</b> members and the verification of their positions in the carrier of charge. To find out what innovative possibilities for a new process assurance do exist, the logistics trade fair „Motek“ has been visited and 13 providers has been invited to a viewing appointment. In practice, only one inspection system has achieved reliable process results. In order to that only one out of 13 providers submitted an offer. Since the payback and implementation period exceeds the contract period with the Daimler plant in Rastatt, {{it is not possible to}} generate savings within this time period. For that reason, the recommended course of action of this study is that fort he company the inspection system is only economically efficient in case of a contract extension...|$|R

50|$|This {{specific}} type of fortification was named after the first discovered example: Trelleborg near Slagelse, excavated in the years 1936-1941. Traditionally, the name trelleborg has been translated and explained as ″a fortress built by slaves″, since the Old Norse word for slave was thrall (The modern Danish word is træl) and borg means fortress or city. But the word trel (pl. trelle) is also a plausible explanation and relates to the wooden staves, <b>covering</b> both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the protective circular walls.|$|R
50|$|Chape has had various {{meanings}} in English, but the predominant {{one is a}} protective fitting {{at the bottom of}} a scabbard or sheath for a sword or dagger (10 in the diagram).

These are generally either in some sort of U shape, protecting the edges only, or a pocket shape <b>covering</b> the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the scabbard as well. The reinforced end of a single-piece metal scabbard can also be called the chape.|$|R

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that the transmission of electromagnetic fields through sub-wavelength slits (parallel to the electric field direction) in a thin metallic screen can be greatly enhanced by <b>covering</b> one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the screen with a metallic cut-wire array laid on a dielectric layer.
