Methods A prospective study was performed to investigate the relations between perifoveal <b>capillary</b> blood <b>flow</b> velocity and the vitreous levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (sICAM- 1) in patients with macular edema and retinal vein occlusion. Undiluted vitreous specimens were obtained from 11 eyes of 11 patients with macular edema (nine had branch retinal vein occlusion and two had central retinal vein occlusion). VEGF and sICAM- 1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. Before vitreous sampling, perifoveal <b>capillary</b> blood <b>flow</b> velocity was measured by fluorescein angiography with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope and the tracing method. The relations between perifoveal <b>capillary</b> blood <b>flow</b> velocity and the vitreous levels of VEGF and sICAM- 1 were investigated.
