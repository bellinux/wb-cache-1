50|$|The {{construction}} of Mir-i-Arab Madrasah (Miri Arab Madrasah) is credited to Sheikh Abdullah Yamani of Yemen. Also called Mir-i-Arab, {{he was considered}} the spiritual mentor of Ubaidullah-khan and his son Abdul-Aziz-khan. Ubaidullah-khan waged a successful war against Iran. At least three times his troops seized Herat. Each plundering raid on Iran resulted in the capture of a great many captives. The money Ubaidullah-khan earned from selling three thousand Persian <b>captives</b> <b>funded</b> the {{construction of}} Mir-i-Arab Madrasah. Ubaidullah-khan was very religious. He had been nurtured in high respect for Islam {{in the spirit of}} Sifism. His father named him in honor of prominent sheikh of the 15th century Ubaidullah al-Ahrar (1404-1490), by origin from Tashkent province.|$|R

We found no indication that involvement in monitoring activities by the investment manager is determined by either fund or human capital characteristics. In relation to value-adding activities, human capital variables were the most important, with previous consulting experience and entrepreneurial experience contributing to a higher involvement in valueadding activities. Furthermore, the diversity of an investment manager’s portfolio was negatively related to involvement in value-adding activities. Finally, with respect to fund level characteristics, we found that investment managers of <b>captive</b> <b>funds</b> were less involved in value-adding activities. venture capital; early stage high tech firms; post-investment follow-up behavior; human capital; fund characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{socially}} responsible investment on public financial markets has drawn considerable academic attention over the last decade. Discarding from previous literature, this paper sets up to analyze the Private Equity channel, which is shown to have the potentiality to foster sustainable practices in unlisted companies. The fast integration of the Environmental, Social and Governance issues by mainstream Private Equity investors is unveiled and appears to {{have benefited from the}} maturation of {{socially responsible investment}} on public financial markets and the impetus of large conventional actors. Hypothesis on the characteristics and drivers of this movement are proposed and tested on a unique database covering the French Private Equity industry in 2011. Empirical findings support that Private Equity responsiblen investing is characterized by shareholder activism and strategically driven by a need for new value creation sources, increased risk management and differentiation. In particular, results show that independent funds, which need to attract investors, are more likely than <b>captive</b> <b>funds</b> to develop responsible practices. Evolution of the movement and future research paths are proposed.

40|$|Given the {{statutory}} goal of parental accountability, this Article {{focuses on a}} narrow issue: Whether parental guarantees are the most effective regulatory tool for shielding {{the federal deposit insurance}} fund from losses when insured banking subsidiaries that are members of a multibank holding company system are insolvent. This Article posits that a needed complement to parental guarantees is temporary substantive consolidation of a holding company 2 ̆ 7 s affiliated banks. This would require the parent company to combine the assets of its banking siblings to facilitate the reorganization of a financially troubled subsidiary. Temporary enterprise consolidation is a necessary regulatory tool because it provides an early form of intracorporate funding from any healthy banking subsidiary that has contributed to the weakened capital status of the financially troubled banking subsidiary. Part II of this Article discusses inherent structural problems of the multibank holding company system. It shows how these unique situations become problematic when a banking subsidiary threatens failure. Part III discusses the traditional prereform parental guarantees - the FRB 2 ̆ 7 s source of strength condition and the OTS 2 ̆ 7 s net worth maintenance agreement. It concludes that both of these regulatory tools, which are essentially identical, have become disfavored by the regulatory agencies and the courts as enforcement methods. The source of strength condition is arguably beyond {{the statutory}} authority of the FRB. The implied net worth maintenance obligation often is unenforceable because it is overbroad and vague. Part IV briefly examines several of the inadequacies of the newest parental guarantee - the prompt corrective action provision. Part V serves as background for the use of temporary consolidation in the banking industry by discussing the FDIC 2 ̆ 7 s methods of resolving failed financial institutions; it explains how interaffiliate lending and <b>captive</b> <b>funding</b> may generate large loan losses and thereby increase the costs of failures within a multibank system. Part VI recommends an alternative to the prompt corrective action provision: temporary consolidation of troubled or undercapitalized banking subsidiaries within a bank holding company system. This alternative addresses the public policy objective of protecting subsidiary banks and the insurance fund {{within the framework of the}} corporate law doctrine of limited liability...|$|R

5000|$|Apart {{from the}} temple of Wadi es-Sebua, Setau also erected another temple at Gerf Hussein on the West Bank of the Nile around Year 45 of Ramesses II. This temple, called the 'House of Ptah' was a hemi-speos or a {{partially}} rock cut and partially exposed temple which was dedicated to Ptah, Ptah-Tatenen and Hathor and associated with the pharaoh himself. An avenue of sphinxes here [...] "led up to a pylon serving as {{the entrance to a}} peristyle court decorated with colossal Osirid statues." [...] Setau also notes in his series of autobiographical stelas that much of his workforce was derived from foreign <b>captives</b> and <b>funded</b> by spoils captured by Ramesses II on his campaigns. This statement is supported by a Year 44 text made by Ramose (TT7), an Egyptian army officer, who states that the pharaoh directed Setau [...] "to take captives from the land of the Libyans" [...] in order to construct the large temple of Wadi es-Sebua. Unfortunately, however, Setau's ambitious goals to leave his mark on the country of Nubia were handicapped by inferior raw materials and his untrained workforce. As Joyce Tyldesley notes: [...] "the buildings which he (ie. Setau) supervised, although at first sight magnificent, were by no means well built while even his own great stela were full of spelling mistakes." ...|$|R

40|$|Infanticidal {{behaviour}} is wide-spread among {{animals of}} various taxonomic groups, {{but has not}} previously been reported in European wild boars, which are commonly kept in enclosures in Sweden and Finland for meat and recreation purposes. We studied the behaviour of wild boars in one enclosure during three reproductive seasons. Non-maternal infanticide was documented in 14 out of 22 litters, causing the deaths of all piglets {{in all but one}} affected litters. Infanticide was typically performed during or shortly after parturition by a sow which was older and larger than the victimised sow, and we found no effect of relatedness. A questionnaire sent to 112 owners of enclosures in Sweden and Finland resulted in 62 responses. Although the owners were often not able to provide exact figures on reproduction and mortality, non-maternal infanticide was reported to be {{the most common cause of}} piglet mortality, which in total was estimated to 29. 1 %. The occurrence of infanticide was unrelated to size of enclosure and to variations in husbandry routines, which all together may suggest that the behaviour is part of the normal behavioural repertoire in European wild boars. The observed levels of infanticide constitute a major welfare problem in <b>captive</b> wild boars. <b>Funding</b> agencies|Swedish Board of Agriculture||Swedish Animal Welfare Agency|...|$|R
40|$|The main {{economic}} {{functions of}} the insurance sector are to cover financial risk and to mobilize long-term savings. The sector can also {{play an important role}} in developing the private sector and modernizing the securities market. But to play its economic and financial roles, the insurance sector must operate within a framework of stable, liberal regulation that provides incentives for efficiency, allows companies to innovate, and creates a contestable market with relatively free entry and exit. In most developing countries, regulation has deviated greatly from this ideal. Often dominated by state-owned companies, the insurance industry in many developing countries features: (a) strict controls on new entry; (b) prohibitions against majority ownership by foreign companies; (c) fixed premiums (especially for compulsory lines); (d) prior approval of tariff changes and new products; (e) high local retention ratios (which discourage reinsurance from overseas companies); (f) insurance reserves used as a <b>captive</b> source of <b>funding</b> for public deficits; and (g) weak prudential controls and inadequate monitoring of solvency. In recent years there has been a growing trend away from direct controls on premiums, products, and investments, and toward more monitoring of the solvency of companies, through more effective supervision and clear prudential controls. The author argues that Tunisia's insurance sector has been hampered by restrictive regulations, by the country's low incomes (which limit long-term savings capabilities), and by it pay-as-you-go social pension system. Tunisia's life insurance is seriously underdeveloped. The insurance is seriously underdeveloped. The insurance industry also suffers from structural problems. Worst of all, prudential regulations and standards are unequally applied, and some companies are still operating with insufficient capital(in a few cases, with greatly negative equity). What is needed? Capital-deficient companies need to be restructured and recapitalized, state-owned companies need to be privatized, and the market needs to be opened up to majority foreign-owned firms. Supervision must be strengthened and corrective measures applied more equitably and forcefully. The social pension system must be radically reformed, to include one fully funded pillar that will generate long-term savings and transform the prospects for life insurance business.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 145 - 155. The {{efficiency}} of the private markets is important in ensuring a healthy economy. This study sets out {{to shed light on}} the decision-making process applied by South African venture capitalists when they allocate capital. Venture capital is defined in this study as including private equity. The study comprises an extensive survey by way of a detailed questionnaire which was mailed to 66 members and non-members of the South African Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (SA VCA) and achieved a 77 % response rate. The questionnaire was based on previous work done in Western and Eastern Europe, and India. This ensured that quantitative South African results could be compared with international results. Quantitative statistical analyses were conducted and the results are presented. The study first identifies the criteria applied in the general evaluation of investments. Second, the required rates of return are established for each stage in the business cycle of the potential investment. Third, various risk factors which might affect the required rate of return are considered. Fourth, the study identifies the valuation methods employed at each stage in the business cycle of the potential investment. Fifth, the use of portfolio theory by South African venture capitalists and private equity investors is examined. In keeping with most similar studies around the world, South African VCs seek out quality entrepreneurial teams. They do this using an array of evaluation criteria which endeavour to flush out the risks inherent in the investments they are evaluating. In South Africa VCs seek strong management and overwhelmingly rate integrity as the most important management quality. Far less important are market issues, followed by product or service issues. This may reflect the perceived dearth of management talent in South Africa. This study analyses the required rates of return of different groupings of VCs by investment stage. It yields results consistent with financial theory as it applies to venture capital: the earlier the stage of investment, the higher the perceived risk profile of that investment. The study finds that more mature VC funds have lower required rates of return than less mature funds. Funds with a development or empowerment objective have lower required rates of return than those without. Independent funds require higher rates of return than <b>captive</b> and semi-captive <b>funds.</b> The required rates of return have only increased by about 2 % since the more buoyant mid to late 1990 s. The debt-equity ratio has an increasing effect on the required rates of return as the investment moves through the earlier stages of investment to the later stages. While the required rate of return of an investment is generally determined by the risk band in which it falls, the effect of the debt equity ratio is dependent upon an assessment of the individual risk characteristics of the investment. The general and specific factors which affect risk and required rate of return are ranked by South African VCs and the results are in keeping with international results. The general factors identify the lack of importance {{of the state of the}} general economy and long-term gilts to the VC's required rate of return, but the importance of the state of the actual sector in which the investee participates. Insofar as specific risks are concerned, management is of particular importance as an indicator of risk, both in respect of the quality of management and the predictability of management's behaviour. An analysis was done of the valuation methods which are used at the different stages of the investment cycle. South African VCs prefer to use the discounted cash flow method of valuation at all stages of the investment, although different techniques are also used in the earlier stages of the investment cycle. A final valuation is based on a preferred method while using the other methods as a check. Gut feeling is an important component of this process. This research also confirms that the newly adopted SAVCA (BVCA) Valuation Guidelines have not affected the valuation process when an investment is made. Most South African VCs apply reasonably sophisticated portfolio theory to their investment portfolios and the majority regard their portfolios as well-diversified. Implications for both South African entrepreneurs and South African VCs are also presented...|$|R
