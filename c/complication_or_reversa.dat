40|$|Male {{patients}} with proven urethral strictures (total 210) were prospectively randomised to undergo either dilatation (106 patients) or internal urethrotomy (104 patients) as an outpatient procedure under local anaesthesia. The incidence of <b>complications</b> <b>or</b> failure during {{the performance of}} the procedure did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups. <b>Complications</b> <b>or</b> failure in performing urethral dilatation were significantly more common in patients who presented with retention <b>or</b> <b>complications</b> compared with symptoms only, and in those with a positive compared with negative urine cultures. <b>Complications</b> <b>or</b> failure in performing internal urethrotomy were significantly more common in {{patients with}} a positive than with a negative urine culture, and long (> 2 cm) rather than short (2 cm), post-traumatic, and previously untreated strictures are better managed with dilatation, whereas patients with <b>complications</b> <b>or</b> retention are better managed with internal urethrotomy. A positive urine culture is associated with a higher complication and failure rate in the performance of both procedures. Articl...|$|R

50|$|It is well {{established}} that obstetric <b>complications</b> <b>or</b> events are {{associated with an increased}} chance of the child later developing schizophrenia, although overall they constitute a non-specific risk factor with a relatively small effect. Obstetric complications occur in approximately 25 to 30% of the general population and the vast majority do not develop schizophrenia, and likewise the majority of individuals with schizophrenia have not had a detectable obstetric event. Nevertheless, the increased average risk is well-replicated, and such events may moderate the effects of genetic or other environmental risk factors. The specific <b>complications</b> <b>or</b> events most linked to schizophrenia, and the mechanisms of their effects, are still under examination.|$|R
