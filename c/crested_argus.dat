50|$|The <b>crest</b> of the <b>Argus</b> Range {{is located}} within NAWS China Lake {{and so the}} peaks of this range are off-limits to the general public. The two peaks that are most {{alluring}} to would-be hikers are Argus Peak (6562 ft) and Maturango Peak (8839 ft) towering {{to the west of}} Panamint Valley.|$|R
50|$|About half of {{the bird}} species are inhabiting the coastal swamps, {{including}} mangroves, riverine forest, freshwater and peat swamp forest, and the marshes of the area. The park {{is one of the}} last strongholds of the white-winged wood duck, with a population between 24-38 birds left, the largest in Sumatra. Among the other 405 species of bird recorded in the park, are the Storm's stork, woolly-necked stork, lesser adjutant, <b>crested</b> fireback, great <b>argus</b> and Oriental darter.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to ongoing}} habitat loss {{as well as}} {{overhunting}} in some areas, the <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> is evaluated as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.|$|E
50|$|Endangered {{bird species}} include great hornbill, rufous-necked hornbill, green peafowl and <b>crested</b> <b>argus.</b> Other bird species include wire-tailed swallow, wreathed hornbill, river lapwing, sooty babbler and rufous-throated fulvetta. One species {{is unique in}} Laos to Nam Kading: the pale-capped pigeon.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about this species in the wild. A shy and elusive bird, the <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> is found in submontane primary forests of Vietnam, Laos and Malaysia in Southeast Asia. The diet {{consists}} mainly of invertebrates, mollusks, amphibians, small reptiles, bamboo shoots, leaves, fruits and fungi. Little {{is known about}} its reproductive strategy. While it is believed by some authorities to be polygamous, {{there is no direct}} evidence to substantiate this theory. Naturalist William Beebe documented pairs of <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> flying to and from the overstory. This suggests that there may be indefinite pair bonds. There is marked delayed maturity in both species. They appear to be fully adult only in their fifth or sixth year.|$|E
50|$|The mammals of {{the park}} are not well known, though {{historically}} it held important species such as the Asian elephant, white-cheeked gibbon and red-shanked douc langur. It also protects important bird species, especially Vietnamese endemics such as the <b>crested</b> <b>argus,</b> Annam partridge and Edwards's pheasant, which had been thought extinct.|$|E
50|$|The {{wings of}} the <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> are of unusual size and length for its weight. They wide and square like those of Argusianus versus rounded and {{abbreviated}} like those of True Pheasants. Additionally, there is no discernible trailing edge secondary wing notch amongst the flight feathers, indicating a capacity of sustained flight in species of this genus. They are morphologically similar to the wings of certain semi-arboreal Craciformes, particularly Guans of the genus Pipile. The feet and legs of <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> are also notable {{in the presence of}} curiously developed leg scales in males which are widened in such a matter that they give each limb the appearance of the foreleg of a Varanid Lizard. The toes are long and gracile and like other peafowls, the hind toe is less recumbent than those of more strictly terrestrial Galliformes.|$|E
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of the Saigon Zoo and Botanical Garden is {{to educate the public}} and protect {{endangered}} animals and plants. One of many programs the zoo participates in to protect endangered species is one to breed animals in captivity, the goal being to replenish their populations. The Saigon Zoo is currently the only zoo in the world that has successfully bred <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> pheasants in captivity.|$|E
50|$|Over 620 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} just on the peninsula. Many are endemic to the mountains of the peninsula, such as the <b>crested</b> <b>argus.</b> Bornean forests show high levels of endemism among bird species, with 38 species found nowhere else. Black-browed babblers and white-crowned shamas are found only in these forests. Large numbers of hornbills, woodpeckers, and pittas such as the mangrove pitta are also present.|$|E
50|$|From limited anecdotal {{observations}} of local indigenous peoples, both species select nest sites in elevated reaches, often amongst escarpments on steep slopes amongst leaf litter. They produce very small clutches of from one-two large eggs which are incubated for 25 days. Like other peafowls, <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> chicks {{are born with}} developed wing feathers. They are bill fed {{for the first few}} weeks. In captivity, males also invest in chick rearing, both bill feeding and brooding the chicks {{both on and off the}} ground.|$|E
50|$|The Phou Ahyon IBA is 148,900 {{hectares}} in size. The IBA altitude varies between 400 - 2193 m {{above sea}} level. The topography contains the Phou Ahyon massif (2193 m), {{which is the}} highest and largest massif in the country's southern area. The habitat is characterized by dry evergreen forest, Fokienia forest, and upper montane forest. Notable avifauna includes black-crowned barwing (Actinodura sodangorum), black-hooded laughingthrush (Garrulax milleti), chestnut-eared laughingthrush (G. konkakinhensis), <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> (Rheinardia ocellata), golden-winged laughingthrush (G. ngoclinhensis), and yellow-billed nuthatch (Sitta solangiae).|$|E
50|$|The 68,125 hectare Hin Nam No (also Hin Namno) Important Bird Area (IBA) {{is within}} the Hin Namno NBCA. Its {{topography}} features limestone karst outcrops, undulating limestone hills, as well as valleys. The IBA's habitat is characterized by sparsely vegetated limestone karst, semi-evergreen tropical rain forest, mixed deciduous forest, moist deciduous tropical forest, and wet evergreen forest. <b>Crested</b> <b>argus</b> (Rheinardia ocellata) and Austen's brown hornbill (Anorrhinus austeni) are classified as near threatened. The inornate squirrel (Callosciurus inornatus) {{has been identified as}} important fauna within the IBA.|$|E
50|$|Peafowl, junglefowl {{and most}} of the {{subtropical}} pheasant genera have very different nutritional requirements from typical Palearctic genera. The Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus) has been observed digging in the rotting wood of deadfall in a similar manner to woodpeckers to extract invertebrates, even bracing itself with aid of its squared tail. The cheer pheasant (Catreus wallichi), <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> (Rheinardia ocellata), the crested partridge (Rollulus roulroul) and the crested guineafowl (Guttera pucherani) are similar ecologically to the Himalayan monal in that they too forage in rotting wood for termites, ant and beetle larvae, molluscs, crustaceans and young rodents.|$|E
50|$|Males measure 210 cm {{long and}} weigh 1529 g. The male is brightly plumaged with a scaled golden {{white and red}} body plumage, grey legs, brown iris and bare red skin around the eye. The head is white with a black narrow band across its eyes. The male has an {{extremely}} long silvery white tail barred with chestnut brown. This pheasant is mentioned in the 2008 edition of Guinness World Records for having the longest natural tail feather of any bird species; a record formerly held by the <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> pheasant. The tail can measure up to 2.4 m long.|$|E
50|$|The Xe Sap Important Bird Area (IBA) is {{situated}} within the Xe Xap National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA) (113,000 ha), surpassing its boundaries. The IBA {{is part of}} two provinces, Salavan and Sekong. It is 137,120 ha in size, and sits {{at an altitude of}} 400 - 2100 m. The habitat includes dry evergreen forest, pine forest, semi-evergreen forest, upper montane forest, and grassland. Two species of gymnosperm were noted: Fokienia hodginsii and Pinus dalatensis. Its avifauna includes Blyth's kingfisher (Alcedo hercules), yellow-billed nuthatch (Sitta solangiae), and <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> (Rheinardia ocellata). There are several types of mammals, two types of primates, and one turtle species.|$|E
50|$|Phước Bình National Park is {{particularly}} valuable as habitat for native birds - {{five of the}} eight restricted-range species {{that occur in the}} Da Lat Plateau Endemic Bird Area (EBA) occur in Phước Bình National Park, including two globally threatened species: collared laughingthrush and <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> (Rheinardia ocellata). It also supports a subspecies of the spot-breasted laughingthrush (Garrulax merulinus annamensis) that is only known from three other Important Bird Areas (IBAs). This form is endemic to the Da Lat Plateau, and is considered by some authors to be a distinct species. Phuoc Binh National Park is also one of only six IBAs in Vietnam to support the globally vulnerable pale-capped pigeon (Columba punicea).|$|E
50|$|Most of the galliform {{birds are}} more or less resident, but some of the smaller {{temperate}} species (such as quail) do migrate over considerable distances. Altitudinal migration is evidently quite common amongst montane species, and a few species of subtropical and subarctic regions must reach their watering and/or foraging areas through sustained flight. Species known to make extensive flights include the ptarmigans, sage-grouse (Centrocercus), crested partridge, green peafowl, <b>crested</b> <b>argus,</b> mountain peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron inopinatum), koklass pheasant (Pucrasia macrolopha), Reeves's pheasant and (Syrmaticus reevesii). Other species—most of the New World quails (also known as the toothed quails), the enigmatic stone partridge (Ptilopachus petrosus) of Africa, guineafowl, and eared pheasants (Crossoptilon)—are all notable for their daily excursions on foot which may take them many miles in a given day.|$|E
50|$|The plateau {{has been}} {{designated}} as an Endemic Bird Area by BirdLife International. The plateau comprises a multitude of habitats for birds. Restricted-range species such as the <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> (Rheinardia ocellata), short-tailed scimitar babbler (Jabouilleia danjoui), black-hooded laughingthrush (Garrulax milleti), white-cheeked laughingthrush (Garrulax vassali), collared laughingthrush (Garrulax yersini), grey-crowned crocias (crocias langbianis) and yellow-billed nuthatch (Sitta solangiae) inhabit the tropical montane broadleaf evergreen forest, the notable exception being the Vietnamese greenfinch (Carduelis monguilloti), which prefers pine forest. The varying altitudes in the plateau also form a congenial environment for birds that are suited to low altitude (up to 1,650 m) such as the black-hooded laughingthrush and the grey-crowned crocias, which rarely ventures above 1,450 m, while the collared laughingthrush often inhabits the higher peaks of the region, reaching above 1,500 m.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> (Rheinardia ocellata) {{are large}} and {{spectacular}} pheasant like-peafowl with dark-brown-spotted black and buff plumage, a heavy pink bill, brown irises and blue skin around the eyes. The head has two crests; the hind crest, which extends down the occiput, is erected when alarmed and during intentional behaviors including pair bonding and courtship displays. The male has a broad and greatly elongated tail of twelve feathers. The tail covert (or [...] "train") of the male is the longest of any bird and is believed to contain the longest (and widest) feathers to occur in a wild bird; the Reeves's pheasant has tail feathers of similar length but which are considerably narrower. The tail coverts measure up to 1.73 m in length, giving the bird a total length of 1.9 - 2.39 m.|$|E
50|$|The male {{performs}} various displays {{that include}} serpentine erratic deportment behaviors which include perceptible quill vibration. The lower extremities of the male's wings and tail are pushed vertically {{into the ground}} leaving trails in sand and leaf litter. These performances may culminate in the lateral compression {{of the body and}} plumage and spreading of his train. The head is held parallel to the ground throughout these display behaviors exhibiting upper throat bristles in one species and downy plumuelles in the second, which together with the forward positioning of the crests, obscure the shape of the head. The male also erects a nuchal hood and hisses audibly while stomping his feet. Like other peafowls, the <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> employs these and more complex display behaviors in anti-predatory encounters, especially with reptiles.|$|E
50|$|Bạch Mã National Park covers 22030 ha, and {{comprises}} three {{zones of}} a strictly protected core area, {{an administrative area}} and a buffer zone. Its habitat types vary from coastal lagoons to montane forest. The Mount Bạch Mã mountain is located within the park. It is the wettest park in Vietnam recording an annual rainfall of 7977 mm, It is considered a 'Centre of Plant Diversity' in Vietnam. The main vegetation type reported consists of moist evergreen forest and montane forest and scrub and grasslands. The park has endemic subspecies of silver pheasant (Lophura nycthemera beli) and Edwards's pheasant (Lophura edwardsi). Asian elephant, white-cheeked gibbons and red-shanked douc langurs are the mammal species recorded but detailed list of mammals in the park {{is yet to be}} prepared. Of the 43 bird species, endemic species of <b>crested</b> <b>argus,</b> the Annam partridge and Edwards's pheasant are reported.|$|E
50|$|The tragopans (Tragopan), mikado {{pheasant}} (Syrmaticus mikado), and {{several species of}} grouse and ptarmigan are exceptional in their largely vegetarian and arboreal foraging habitats; grouse are especially notable {{for being able to}} feed on plants rich in terpenes and quinones - such as sagebrush or conifers -, which are often avoided by other herbivores. Many species of moderate altitudes—for example the long-tailed pheasants of the genus Syrmaticus—also find a great deal of their daily nutritional requirements in the tree canopies, especially during the snowy and rainy periods when foraging on the ground is dangerous and less than fruitful for a variety of reasons. Although members of the genus Syrmaticus are capable of subsisting almost entirely on vegetarian materials for months at a time, this is not true for many of the subtropical genera. For example, the great argus (Argusianus argus) and <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> may do most of their foraging during rainy months in the canopy of the jungle, as well. There they are known to forage on slugs, snails, ants, and amphibians to the exclusion of plant material. How they forage in the forest canopy during the rainy months is unknown.|$|E
50|$|The Xe Sap IBA {{is located}} within the Xe Xap National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA); the IBA surpasses the NBCA's 1335 km2 {{boundaries}} (established in February 1996). The IBA and NBCA are part of two provinces, Sekong and Salavan. The NBCA sits {{at an altitude of}} 400 - 2066 m and is 1335 km2 in size; the highest peak is Dong Be with an altitude of 2,066 m, part of the Southern Annamite Mountains. The habitat is characterized by various forests (dry evergreen, pine, semi-evergreen, and upper montane), as well as grassland. Two species of gymnosperm were recorded. Its key avifauna includes Blyth's kingfisher (Alcedo hercules), <b>crested</b> <b>argus</b> (Rheinardia ocellata), and yellow-billed nuthatch (Sitta solangiae). Other notable wildlife are two types of primates and one turtle species. An unpaved road from Salavan to Ta-Oy and further east to Samuoy runs the northern border of Xe Sap NBCA. But small paths provide approaches from the main road to villages located on {{the northern part of the}} NBCA. The southeastern part of NBCA is difficult to reach. However, the Kong River (or Xe Kong, or Sekong) and its two tributaries Xe Sap and Xe Lon provide access to the reserve by boats. The reserve has many water falls, rocky cliffs and rhododendrons at higher elevations. There are 43 mammals (including 18 key species), 178 birds (18 are key species), 48 reptiles and 33 amphibians; the notable species of wildlife are two species of bears, serow, large antlered muntjac, large number of gaurs and tigers. A particular plant species are Pinus dalatensis and Kinabaluchloa species, a genus of bamboo.|$|E
