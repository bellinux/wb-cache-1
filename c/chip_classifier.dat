The system includes a retina chip, two convolution chips, a 2 D winner-take-all chip, a delay line <b>chip,</b> a learning <b>classifier</b> <b>chip,</b> {{and a set}} of PCBs for computer interfacing and address space remappings. The components use a mixture of analog and digital computation and will learn to classify trajectories of a moving object. A complete experimental setup and measurements results are shown. ...|$|R
40|$|Context: About 50 – 70 % of {{patients}} with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) experience relapse of disease. Objective: To establish a panel of protein biomarkers incorporated in a multiplexed microarray (BCa <b>chip)</b> and a <b>classifier</b> for diagnosing recurrent NMIBC. Materials and methods: Urine samples from 45 patients were tested. Diagnostic performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: A multi biomarker panel (ECadh, IL 8, MMP 9, EN 2, VEGF, past recurrences, BCG therapies and stage at diagnosis) was identified yielding an area under the curve of 0. 96. Discussion and conclusion: This biomarker panel represents a potential diagnostic tool for noninvasive diagnosis of recurrent NMIBC...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a hardware implementation of tree classifiers {{based on a}} custom VLSI chip and a CPLD <b>chip.</b> The tree <b>classifier</b> comprises a first layer of threshold logic unit, implemented on a reconfigurable custom chip, followed by a logical function implemented using a CPLD chip. We first describe the architecture of tree classifiers and compare its performance with support vector machine (SVM) for different data sets. The reconfigurability of the hardware (number of classifiers, topology and precision) is discussed. Experimental {{results show that the}} hardware presents a number of interesting feature such as reconfigurability, as well as improved fault tolerance. © 2004 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|The {{classification}} of handwritten digits through an analog feature extractor <b>chip</b> and neural <b>classifier</b> {{is discussed in}} this paper. The chip implements a feature extraction algorithm onto analog circuits; it extracts a set of 112 features from the input character (32 x 24 binary pixel matrix). The features, coded by current signals, are given in input to a neural classifier which performs the recognition task. The chip validation results are reported: a set of handwritten digits have been classified by a neural network implementation by a software simulator. The resulting classification error rate has been successfully compared with the ones obtained by high level mo 0 del of the chip and to those obtained with other techniques reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes the fractal {{patterns}} classifier {{for multiple}} cardiac arrhythmias on {{field-programmable gate array}} (FPGA) device. Fractal dimension transformation (FDT) is employed to adjoin the fractal features of QRS-complex, including the supraventricular ectopic beat, bundle branch ectopic beat, and ventricular ectopic beat. FDT with fractal dimension (FD) is addressed for constructing various symptomatic patterns, which can produce family functions and enhance features, making clear differences between normal and unhealthy subjects. The probabilistic neural network (PNN) is proposed for recognizing multiple cardiac arrhythmias. Numerical experiments verify the efficiency and higher accuracy with the software simulation in order to formulate the mathematical model logical circuits. FDT results in data self-similarity for the same arrhythmia category, the number of dataset requirement and PNN architecture can be reduced. Its simplified model can be easily embedded in the FPGA <b>chip.</b> The prototype <b>classifier</b> is tested using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, and the tests reveal its practicality for monitoring ECG signals...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a Hamming Distance Classifier based on static memory cells and an analog winner-takes-all circuit depends on device matching in the {{various parts of the}} circuit. This dependence has been analyzed, leading to design criteria for choosing the device sizes and chip structure. The theoretical {{performance of}} a CMOS chip designed to operate in the subthreshold region has been compared with the actual experimental results. 1 Introduction This paper investigates the effect of device mismatch on the {{performance of a}} Hamming Distance <b>Classifier</b> <b>chip.</b> When presented with a binary test pattern, the chip will recall which of a given set of memorized patterns is closest in Hamming distance to the test pattern. Use of subthreshold CMOS devices as analog computing elements provides extremely fast distributed computing, efficient utilization of chip area and very low power consumption. However, when two patterns are almost equally close to the test pattern, device mismatch in the an [...] ...|$|R
