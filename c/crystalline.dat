40|$|Many {{investigations}} on {{mechanisms of}} the fatigue crack propagation {{have been made}} in macroscopic field. Especially, it was evident that the crack propagations were good correlated with characteristic features at the tip of crack in those investigations. On the other hand, it is very interesting to research the crack propagation from microscopic field such as the relation between stress and the strength of the <b>crystallines</b> ahead of the tip of fatigue cracks. Now, {{it is well known that}} the <b>crystallines</b> of the tip of crack are in the state of work hardening, and there is close correlation between work hardening and dislocation density, too.

5|$|In 2005, the Gemini and Keck telescopes {{obtained}} {{spectra of}} Haumea which showed strong <b>crystalline</b> water ice features {{similar to the}} surface of Pluto's moon Charon. This is peculiar, because <b>crystalline</b> ice forms at temperatures above 110 K, whereas Haumea's surface temperature is below 50 K, a temperature at which amorphous ice is formed. In addition, the structure of <b>crystalline</b> ice is unstable under the constant rain of cosmic rays and energetic particles from the Sun that strike trans-Neptunian objects. The timescale for the <b>crystalline</b> ice to revert to amorphous ice under this bombardment is on the order of ten million years, yet trans-Neptunian objects have been in their present cold-temperature locations for timescales of billions of years. Radiation damage should also redden and darken the surface of trans-Neptunian objects where the common surface materials of organic ices and tholin-like compounds are present, {{as is the case with}} Pluto. Therefore, the spectra and colour suggest Haumea and its family members have undergone recent resurfacing that produced fresh ice. However, no plausible resurfacing mechanism has been suggested.|$|E

This however is more peculiarly true of the slaty <b>crystallines.</b> It is perfectly possible, by many processes of chemistry, to produce masses of irregular crystals which, though not of the substance of granite, are very like it in their mode of arrangement. But, as far as I am aware, it is impossible to produce artificially anything resembling the structure of the slaty <b>crystallines.</b> And the more I have examined the rocks themselves, the more I have felt at once the difficulty of explaining the method of their formation, and the growing interest of inquiries respecting that method.

This is in great part deceptive, being obtained by the receding of the crest into a great mountain crater, or basin, as explained in § 11. But this very recession is a matter of interest, for it takes place exactly on the line above spoken of, where the slaty <b>crystallines</b> of the crest join the compact <b>crystallines</b> of the aiguilles; at which junction a correspondent chasm or recession, of some kind or another, takes place along the whole front of Mont Blanc.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT One of {{the long}} {{recognized}} features of Himalayan geology is the apparent inversion of metamorphic sequences, as evidenced in both metamorphic parageneses and thermobarometric data. With the aid of an extended thermobarometric dataset from the Langtang Valley section of the Higher Himalayan <b>Crystallines,</b> it can be demonstrated that the relatively large uncertainties associated with traditional thermobarometric techniques severely limit the tectonic interpretation of metamorphic gradients across the Himalayas. We apply the recently developed DPT approach, which significantly improves the precision to which pressure and temperature diVerences between samples may be calculated. High-precision thermo-barometric data reveal an isothermal, rather than inverted, temperature array at Langtang, while the pressure data suggest significant structural complexity, with the Higher Himalayan <b>Crystallines</b> in the Langtang section comprising two distinct, possibly duplicated sequences, each having experienced con-siderable structural attenuation following metamorphism...|$|R

40|$|Granulite-facies garnet-bearing metapelites, metabasics and calc-silicate rocks {{from the}} lower {{metamorphic}} complex (Kharta Gneiss) of the Greater Himalayan <b>Crystallines</b> in the Kharta region of S Tibet, E Himalaya, preserve textural and chemical evidence for prograde equilibration at temperatures of at least 700 - 720 °C and pressures around 8 kbar during the main event of the Himalayan metamorphism. Post-deformational reaction textures include clinopyroxene (± orthopyroxene) - plagioclase symplectites after garnet in calc-silicate rocks, and cordierite ± spinel coronas on sillimanite and garnet in metapelite granulites. These assemblages indicate a decompressional pressure-temperature path that is confirmed by the geothermobarometry of zoned and symplectite minerals {{as well as by}} calculated phase equilibria. Isothermal decompression through ca. 3 kbar occurred at temperatures of about 700 °C, and was followed by further decompression to P ~ 3 kbar, and T ~ 710 °C. At this point, decompression was replaced by quasi-isobaric cooling ending in the andalusite stability field at P ca. 2. 5 kbar. The P-T path of the Kharta Gneiss appears to be similar to those inferred for the lower Greater Himalayan <b>Crystallines</b> exposed in the nearby Dudh Kosi and middle Arun valleys of eastern Nepal. This type of clockwise P-T path, with most of the exhumation occurring at relatively constant metamorphic temperatures, requires a high exhumation rate and suggests that extrusion tectonics of crustal-scale wedges may have been operative during post-collisional exhumation of the Greater Himalayan <b>Crystallines...</b>|$|R
