2500|$|In {{the context}} of {{mountain}} biking the term compact crankset, or micro drive, refers to smaller triple cranksets, giving a small benefit in weight {{at the expense of}} increased wear and also giving the bike better clearance over obstacles. [...] Typical ratios would be 22/32/44 teeth as opposed to 28/38/48 or 24/36/46 teeth. [...] These would be used with smaller cassettes (Generally cassettes are available with 11 tooth minimum gear sizes for compact <b>chainsets</b> while standard <b>chainsets</b> were designed for cassettes with a 13 or 14 tooth top gear), giving the same overall ratio. Compact chainrings have been the dominant standard for mountain bike cranks since the mid nineties.|$|R

5000|$|Authors such as Simon Doughty {{describe}} a 'typical' randonneuring bike as being {{somewhere between a}} dedicated road-racing bike and a touring bike. [...] Such bicycles usually have lightweight steel frames, drop handlebars, relaxed (i.e. comfortable) frame geometry, medium-width tyres, triple <b>chainsets,</b> moderately low gearing, {{and the capacity to}} carry lightweight luggage.

50|$|The {{bottom bracket}} {{on a bicycle}} connects the {{crankset}} (<b>chainset)</b> to the bicycle and allows the crankset to rotate freely. It contains a spindle that the crankset attaches to, and the bearings that allow the spindle and cranks to rotate. The chainrings and pedals attach to the cranks.

The system is useful for folding bicycles (where a multiple front <b>chainset</b> could foul the bike's folding mechanism), in recumbent bicycles, and freight bicycles (where small wheels and/or increased weight require {{a wider range of}} gears with smaller steps). Hub gears have in the past also been used on motorcycles, although this is now rare.|$|E

50|$|Alexi Grewal used {{a bicycle}} {{equipped}} with Shimano DynaDrive <b>chainset</b> and pedals (the {{remainder of the}} components on his bicycle were primarily Suntour and DiaCompe) to win the 1984 Olympic road race in Los Angeles. In the 1988 Giro d'Italia, Andy Hampsten rode Shimano to its first Grand Tour victory. In 2002, world championships in both the road and time trial disciplines were won on Shimano equipment. Alberto Contador's 2007 victory in the Tour de France on a Shimano-equipped bicycle represents the first official General Classification victory in that race by a rider using Shimano components.|$|E
50|$|While {{this is a}} {{downhill}} race at the start, the event can cover up to 30 km in blistering heat of the summer. A downhill bike (often with upward of 8 inches(203 mm) of suspension travel at each end) is not recommended to be competitive, though many competitors choose to ride them. A dual-chainring equipped 'freeride' is the bike choice, having 5-7 inches (130-178 mm) of travel and single crown forks. The 2006 winner Nicolas Vouilloz rode a 150 mm travel bike with a Dura Ace <b>chainset</b> and semi slick rear tyre. Whilst 'Freeride' and 'all mountain' bikes are {{the best choice for}} competing and for the long uphill climb on the 'mega' course, downhill bikes provide a much more forgiving and comfortable ride over the rocky and often rutted terrain of the qualifier course.|$|E
5000|$|Specialized {{started to}} produce the Stumpjumper in 1981, making it the first {{mass-production}} mountain bike. The first Stumpjumper was produced in Japan and {{was based on a}} design for a custom-made bike originally marketed by Tom Ritchey, Gary Fisher and Charles Kelly. Specialized's founder Mike Sinyard has explained that the company's aim was to [...] "make a bike on a production basis but as though it was a custom bike". The first Stumpjumpers had welded steel frames because the lugged and brazed frames that designer Tim Neenan wanted to use were not available at the time. The original bike had a modiﬁed BMX stem and handlebars based on Magura motorcycle handlebars. The bike was equipped with 15-speed Suntour ARX GT gears, originally designed for use on road bikes, and the Stumpjumper also featured Mafac cantilever brakes and a TA Cyclotourist <b>chainset,</b> both designed for touring bikes. It had no suspension. The bike weighed just under 30 lb.|$|E
40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. One {{of the most popular}} methods of assessment of power output during short-term maximal of exercise is the Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT), but this test suffers from serious conceptual limitations. Therefore, the first aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementation of correct power measurement in the WAnT. The second aim was to design and construct a pair of force pedals, and the last objective was to use these pedals to analyse the force application and power output of elite sprint cyclists during maximal ergometry. The inertial and frictional characteristics of Monark ergometer flywheels were assessed using 'run-down' techniques. Moments of Inertia of 0. 411 (± 0. 001) and 0. 396 (± 0. 002) kg. m. 2 were found for the two Monark 864 ergometers measured, with the newer 814 ergometer possessing a value of 0. 962 (± 0. 003) kg. m. 2. Frictional torques of 0. 0025 (± 0. 0030) to 0. 1720 (± 0. 00 16) N. m. were found, depending on the attachments to the flywheel and <b>chainset.</b> These values were then utilised to correct the power outputs obtained during the WAnT. Corrected powers were found to produce significantly (P< 0. 001) larger peak and mean power outputs than those obtained using uncorrected methods. The methods used also produced significantly different (P< 0. 01) corrected power outputs to those of Lakomy (1986), who utilised an incorrect method of'acceleration-correction'. The force pedals were found to be highly linear in calibration and force measurement, as well as suitable for ergometer cycling. These were then used to test elite sprint cyclists on a modified Monark ergometer. The results of the sprint testing of cyclists found no overall significant difference between power measured indirectly (at the flywheel) and that measured at the pedals. There were significant differences between flywheel and pedal power outputs at high pedal velocity, and this was attributed to large crank torques, in agreement with Sjøgaard (1978). Also noted were differences in force application patterns between cyclists, indicating the use of a variety of pedalling techniques. It was concluded that inertial correction of the WAnT is mandatory for the accurate measurement of power output, and that this needs to be based on sound mechanical principles. This study has also shown that is possible to measure power accurately using indirect methods. However, if the individual techniques of elite sprint cyclists are to be examined in detail, it is necessary to utilise force pedals...|$|E
