Exposure to <b>chlorophenols</b> can cause harmful effects in plants and animals, including humans. In this study, sediment, mussel tissues and wood samples from two local reservoirs (Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley) were analyzed for dichlorophenol (DCP), trichlorophenol (TCP), tetrachlorophenol (TeCP), and pentachlorophenol (PCP). PCP concentrations ranged from below detection limits (0. 6 ng) to 86 ng/g dry weight in sediment samples and from 660 to 2270 ng/g dry weight in freshwater mussel tissue samples. Elevated concentrations in mussel tissues indicate bioaccumulation of <b>chlorophenols</b> in freshwater mussels.

30|$|<b>Chlorophenols</b> are {{xenobiotic}} contaminants {{that occur}} during numerous anthropogenic activities and become {{released into the}} environment (Zilouei et al. 2006). These compounds are widely used as mothproofing agents, miticides, germicides, algicides, fungicides, and wood preservatives {{as well as for}} the synthesis of dyes and drugs (Arora and Bae 2014). Owing to their biocide properties, <b>chlorophenols</b> in industrial wastewater pose serious ecological problems as environmental pollutants (Salmerón-Alcocer et al. 2007; Bajaj et al. 2008). Because of their ecological risk, <b>chlorophenols</b> become the target of investigations focusing on their possible biodegradation (Khodadoust et al. 1997; Wilson et al. 1997). Various <b>chlorophenols,</b> including 2 -chlorophenol (2 -CP), have been listed as priority pollutants by US Environmental Protection (EPA) (Oh et al. 2011). Fortunately, these compounds can be degraded by indigenous microorganisms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Häggblom et al. 2000). In aerobic pathway, the biodegradation of <b>chlorophenols</b> is more diverse since the ring cleavage may occur before dechlorination, thus forming more complex intermediates of various toxicity (Chang et al. 2003). Contrarily, many types of microorganisms, Desulfomonile tiedjei, Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans, and Desulfitobacterium dehalogenans, are known to utilize <b>chlorophenols</b> as their sole carbon and energy source under anaerobic conditions. The anaerobic pathway produced less-chlorinated intermediates that are less toxic to the environment (Bajaj et al. 2008; Chang et al. 2003). For large scale wastewater treatment, mixed consortia rather than pure cultures are preferred because they are easier to handle and contain diverse microorganisms capable of withstanding various unfavorable influent fluctuations.|$|R
