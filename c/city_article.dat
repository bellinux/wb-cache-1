60|$|It is {{practically}} impossible for two equally valid sets of reasons. The {{first is that}} under existing conditions, saving and investment constitute {{the only way to}} rest and security in old age, to leisure, study and intellectual independence, to the safe upbringing of a family and the happiness of one's weaker dependents. These are things that should not be left for the individual to provide; in the civilized state, the state itself will insure every citizen against these anxieties that now make the study of the <b>City</b> <b>Article</b> almost a duty. To abandon saving and investment to-day, and to do so is of course to abandon all insurance, is to become a driven and uncertain worker, to risk one's personal freedom and culture and the upbringing and efficiency of one's children. It is to lower the standard of one's personal civilization, to think with less deliberation and less detachment, to fall away from that work of accumulating fine habits and beautiful and pleasant ways of living contributory to the coming State. And in the second place there is not only no return for such a sacrifice in anything won for Socialism, but for fine-thinking and living people to give up property is merely to let it pass into the hands of more egoistic possessors. Since at present things must be privately owned, it is better that they should be owned by people consciously working for social development and willing to use them to that end.|$|E

Section 2.4 restricts {{the context in which}} gifts or favors are given and what can be given. It also explains who can give gifts or favors and what amounts in certain situations can be given. Section 2.5 City Owned Property addressed that use of property of the city is for official use only and all uses must be authorized prior to usage by city officials or employees. Then Section 2.6 Use or Disclosure of Confidential Information explains that officials, candidates, and city employees shall not disclose confidential information other than what required by law, performing his or her official duties, and as permitted in section 2.13. The Municipal Finance Code continues explanations in conflicts of interest regulating business conducted with people like family members of an official, representations of other people regulating how officials and employees represent the city or other persons in situations, post employment restrictions regulating how business is conducted after leaving a job with the city or official position, interests in city business regulating the interaction of business conducted with officials or employees for contracts, services, or other work. After those sections this amendment addresses the employment of Relative in which input is prohibited in the decision process of hiring someone of relation to an official or employee of the city. The hiring of relatives has been controversial for several mayor administrations in the past.

This framework should be adapted to Klaipėda seaport because the problem of the port and city separation is not solved here.

To supplement {{an evaluation of the}} Article 47 regulations, we conducted an exploratory ecologic study to examine changes in childhood obesity prevalence among low-income preschool children enrolled in the Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in New York City neighborhoods with or without a district public health office. We conducted the study 3 years before (from 2004 through 2006) and after (from 2008 through 2010) the implementation of the regulations in 2007. MethodsWe used an ecologic, time-trend analysis to compare 3 -year cumulative obesity prevalence among WIC-enrolled preschool children during 2004 to 2006 and 2008 to 2010.

40|$|The society, {{which has}} {{produced}} form {{and shape of}} the traditional European city does not exist any more. ” (Siebel 2004) Raising our conscience on this circumstance as it as been pointed to by Walter Siebel does make planning issues re-appear in the light of knowledge that problems tackled on the basis of realities no longer there, {{are not going to be}} solved. In spite of this knowledge however the discourse around the European city seems to narrow a perspective to fully grasp reasons for the stagnation of its spatial form in the backdrop of socio-cultural change. For this reason I want to include another city into the discussion, which by Siebel’s definition is a typical European city and therefore fit for a comparison with postfeudal European Cities around which Siebel´s theory is oriented. At the same time however Istanbul lifts itself from an euro-centred context by never having fully internalized culturally the mechanisms of spatial production based on western capitalism. In this contribution I will look at the role of this cultural heritage for the prevalence of spatial specificities. Without the cultural backbone of civic management and social redistribution Istanbul is now, in the late stage of capitalism, a city that has integrated the global tendencies of neo-liberalism directly into the production of urban space. It demonstrates therefore clearly the realities of society through the characteristics of the built environment. Possibly the image that prevails with its new more explicit forms of urban segregation and the rise of gated communities is a glimpse upon social realities which have gained validity also for the European <b>City.</b> <b>Article</b> in Germany </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{management}} of solid waste in Addis Ababa, {{with the objective of}} understanding the underlying reasons for the poor solid waste management situation that the city is faced with today. Accordingly, governance and urban political ecology are used as a theoretical framework. Governance was chosen because currently it dominates the development discourse and governance policies are implemented by governments aiming to improve urban services, whereas urban political ecology is used to explore how governance processes operate within solid waste management in the city. In order to understand the reasons for the decisions and actions that have taken place within solid waste management and to understand better the present-day situation, I focus on exploring actors’ subjective views, the nature of the power relationships between them, and politics at various scales. An ethnographic approach is used to explore the subjective perspectives of the actors involved in solid waste management in Addis Ababa. The main method used was semistructured interviews, which were designed to collect the subjective views of the participants involved and identify conflicting interests. In addition, personal observations and document and newspaper reviews were used. The methods were used to compare the subjective views and official norms with my observations made in the field. The analysis of data started in the field, using constant comparative method, whereby all interviews were compared within a group of actors and between groups of actors and then related to the research context. This was considered a logical way to make sense of and order the information in order to confirm or dispute it, and {{was also one of the}} techniques used to ensure the reliability of the data collected. The main findings of the study are described in the five articles that are attached to this thesis. All of the articles address the formal rules, regulations, and policies officially adopted to improve solid waste management in Addis Ababa. The official rules and regulations are compared with the findings of a detailed study of how they are adopted and implemented, by focusing on the various actors’ subjective views and agendas and how these are acted upon based on the distribution of power between them. The articles address different aspects of solid waste management, including attempts to enter into partnership with the private sector (Articles 1 and 2), attempts to plan a new solid waste management system (Article 3), the relationship between the city administration and the informal recycling sector (Article 3), international organizations’ involvement in improving solid waste in the <b>city</b> (<b>Article</b> 4) and how dominant discourses such as neoliberalism and good governance have affected solid waste management in different African cities (Article 5). The articles show how power and politics affect the way that solid waste is managed in Addis Ababa, and I argue that the promise of good governance has not resulted in the official goals being attained, but rather a rhetorical use of policies and reforms. The Ethiopian Government has adapted good governance policies to suite its own interests and agendas, and this has not led to improved governance and a more efficient management of solid waste in the city. This thesis contributes to an understanding of the underlying reasons for the poor solid waste management in Addis Ababa today, and the identification of aspects and strategies that should be in place in order to improve solid waste management and to achieve more equitable development among the various actors` involved. I conclude by arguing for a more critical approach in studies of urban services, where the focus should be on both the politics and power relationships among involved actors and on the politics of scales.
