ABSTRACT: Application of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) in neonate with respiratory distress is associated with reduction of respiratory failure, reduced complications and mortality. Devices used to generate CPAP include conventional ventilators, the “bubble bottle ” system and the infant flow driver. CPAP supports the breathing of preterm infants {{in a number of}} ways. It splints the upper airway and reduces obstruction and apnea, assists expansion of the lungs, and prevents alveolar collapse. But when we consider using Bubble CPAP system in Emergency Medical Services like Air Ambulance, it is extremely difficult to maintain <b>constant</b> <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> created by bubbles in water bottle to the expiratory end of nasal prongs of an infant. So in order to provide <b>constant</b> <b>back</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{there is a need to}} replace water bottle which produce back pressure by bubble at expiratory end with a Electro-Mechanical constant pressure generating system. A Proportional solenoid valve based Electro-Magnetic Pressure Generator device is proposed, which produce <b>constant</b> <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> of 5 - 10 cmH 2 O Pressure and Pressure versus Voltage relationship is studied which shows pressure generated is proportional t...|$|E

The displacement pump was started to inject brine to the core and when the flow was stable, the flow rate and the inlet and outlet pressure were recorded, and core permeability was calculated at this pressure level.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{isolator}} of a Scramjet engine. The influence of wall and total temperature on the flow field is investigated {{with the help of}} different wind tunnel models. The wall temperature is varied from 300 K to 1000 K and the total temperature between 1150 K and 2200 K. The free stream Mach number is Ma∞ = 7. 5. The experiments are supported by numerical flow simulations. In a typical Scramjet isolator with inlet the shock train as well as a shock boundary layer interaction are investigated. The experiments show that the relation between wall and total temperature is a good similarity parameter here. At <b>constant</b> <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> the shock train grows upstream into the isolator with increasing wall to total temperature ratio. The flow field that enters the isolator is influenced by the inlet e. g. by the wall temperature. Also the investigated inlet produces an asymmetric profile entering the isolator. A model with rectangular cross section and homogenous inflow is investigated. The entering flow profile is also not influenced by any wall temperature. The isolator inlet Mach number is varied between 2 and 3. 5. Here for <b>constant</b> <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> the shock train length is decreasing with increasing wall temperature. This effect is most prominent when the wall temperature is getting close to the recovery temperature. Therefore the wall to total temperature ratio is not a similarity parameter here. The existing correlation by Waltrup and Billig cannot describe the observed effect quantitatively. It is modified based on the results and does now include the influence of the wall heat transfer. The influence of the flow channel width on the flow field is investigated with an additional model. In that model the isolator width can be varied. At a constant overall pressure rise the additional compression by the leading edge shocks of the side walls leads to a decrease of the shock train length. With increasing ratio between wall area and cross section (closing in on a quadratic cross section) the losses caused by the boundary layer increase and the shock train length is increasing...|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} is described which allowed {{the measurement of}} the oxygen consumption of the isolated heart of Octopus vulgaris. Contraction of the heart resulted in an aortic output and a flow through the heart muscle into coronary veins (the coronary output). The flow and oxygen content of the aortic output and the coronary output were measured with variable input <b>pressures</b> and <b>constant</b> output <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> (volume loaded), variable output <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> and <b>constant</b> aortic output (pressure loaded), and during hypoxia. Volume loading of the heart resulted {{in an increase in}} aortic output, power output and total oxygen consumption. Pressure loading increased power output and total oxygen consumption of the heart. Exposure to hypoxia decreased the aortic output, power output and total cardiac oxygen consumption. In the response of the heart to reduced work, brought about either by a reduced input pressure or by hypoxic perfusate, the power output was linearly related to the total oxygen consumption of the heart. The oxygen extracted from the coronary output accounted for 80 - 100 % of the total oxygen consumption of the heart. Coronary output amounted to 30 % of the total cardiac output at maximum power output. In volume-loaded hearts the volume of the coronary output increased as aortic output increased; in pressure-loaded hearts coronary output increased as power output increased, but aortic output remained constant. In hypoxia, the coronary output increased as the aortic output fell. At a perfusate Po 2 of around 50 Torr (1 Torr = 133 Pa), the aortic output ceased although the heart continued to beat and the coronary output continued, accounting for all of the oxygen consumption of the heart. The coronary output flow in vitro therefore has the capacity to be varied independently of the aortic output flow to maintain the oxygen supply to the perfused cardiac muscle...|$|R

The microstructural and hardness changes caused by annealing were characterized by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) and microhardness measurements. The application of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> resulted in an earlier drop in hardness upon annealing, which {{is believed to be}} associated with a lower critical temperature for the initiation of recrystallization and a rapid coarsening of microstructure.
