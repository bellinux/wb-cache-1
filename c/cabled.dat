5|$|On 17 October 1942, Australian Prime Minister John Curtin <b>cabled</b> British Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{to request}} that the 9th Division be {{returned}} to Australia. In the cable Curtin stated that, owing to Australia's manpower shortage {{and the demands of}} the war in the Pacific, it was no longer possible to provide enough reinforcements to sustain the division in the Middle East. The British Government initially resisted this request {{on the grounds that the}} 9th Division was required for the upcoming offensive at El Alamein. On 29 October (six days into the battle) Curtin again <b>cabled</b> Churchill, stating that Australia needed the division in the Pacific and in a fit state to participate in offensive operations. On 1 November, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote to Curtin proposing to send another US Army division to Australia if the Australian Government agreed to retain the 9th Division in the Middle East. Curtin, acting on the advice of MacArthur, responded to Roosevelt on 16 November rejecting this suggestion, and again requested that the 9th Division be returned.|$|E

Its former president, Sir Clements Markham, privately expressed his disbelief of Shackleton's claimed latitude.

50|$|Breakout-style fiberoptic <b>cable</b> (also called {{breakout}} <b>cable</b> or fanout <b>cable),</b> is {{an optical}} fiber <b>cable</b> containing several jacketed simplex optical fibers packaged together inside an outer jacket.

The design of breakout-style <b>cable</b> adds strength for ruggedized drops, however the <b>cable</b> is larger and more expensive than distribution-style <b>cable.</b> Breakout <b>cable</b> is suitable for short riser and plenum applications and also for use in conduits, where a very simple <b>cable</b> run is planned to avoid {{the use of any}} splicebox or spliced fiber pigtails.|$|R
5|$|In June 1942, {{shortly after}} the Navy's public {{acknowledgment}} of the sinking, workers at the Quincy shipyard, where the ship had been built twenty-one years earlier, <b>cabled</b> Navy Secretary Frank Knox and proposed {{a change in the}} name of one of the new Essex-class fleet carriers currently under construction there to Lexington (from Cabot). Knox agreed to the proposal and the carrier was renamed as the fifth Lexington on 16 June 1942. On 17 February 1943, her successor was formally commissioned as USS Lexington (CV-16), which served as the flagship of Task Force 58 (TF 58) during the Battle of the Philippine Sea and remained in service until 1991.|$|E
5|$|The day before, the Ottoman {{government}} had proposed to Wangenheim that a fictitious {{purchase of the}} German ships be arranged, so their presence would not compromise Ottoman neutrality.

The Grand Vizier accosted Wagenheim on the premature arrival of the ships and repeated the demand for a fictitious sale. The Ottoman government subsequently declared that it had purchased both ships for 80 million German marks. On 14 August, Wagenheim advised the German government {{that it would be}} best to go along with the sale, lest they risk angering the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|There was {{considerable}} confusion following Shout's death. Army Headquarters in Melbourne <b>cabled</b> Rose Shout on 15 August to inform her that Alfred had been wounded.

This communication stated that Shout was not dead, but alive and returning to Australia aboard the Thermistocles. The press in Australia published news of his pending return, adding that he would arrive in Sydney in mid-September. This {{proved to be a}} case of mistaken identity. Shout's death was confirmed by 26 August; a Lieutenant A.J. Shirt, also of the 1st Battalion, was the officer aboard the Thermistocles. Rose Shout received a ministerial apology for the clerical errors and distress caused.|$|E

40|$|Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) is an {{advanced}} composite material with advantages of high strength and light weight, giving it great {{potential to be}} a new, reliable <b>cable</b> material. Ideal structures for CFRP <b>cables</b> are orthogonally loaded <b>cable</b> structures, where <b>cables</b> are loaded orthogonally or approximately orthogonally by external loads. Using CFRP <b>cables</b> in such structures, e. g. <b>cable</b> roofs and <b>cable</b> facades, has advantages over traditional steel <b>cable</b> structures. In order to demonstrate this point, two typical orthogonally loaded <b>cable</b> structures, i. e. a CFRP spoked wheel <b>cable</b> roof and a CFRP <b>cable</b> net façade, were investigated in a case study. Their mechanical properties and economies are compared with that of the steel counterparts. Results show that CFRP <b>cables</b> can effectively improve the mechanical and economical performances of orthogonally loaded <b>cable</b> structures; furthermore, the advantages of applying CFRP <b>cables</b> for <b>cable</b> net facade are more obvious than that for spoked wheel <b>cable</b> roof...|$|R

This proposal was approved by Prime Minister Cook but he increased the offer to the British to 20,000 men to serve in any destination desired by the Home Government. On 6 August 1914, London <b>cabled</b> its acceptance of the force and asked that it be sent as soon as possible.

5|$|Howe <b>cabled</b> Anderson {{expressing the}} Canadian government's {{agreement}} in principle, but requesting {{a more detailed}} appraisal {{of the cost of}} the proposed laboratory. Sir John Anderson replied that he envisaged a laboratory with about 30 scientists and 25 laboratory assistants, of whom 22 scientists and 6 laboratory assistants would be sent from Britain. The estimated running cost was £60,000 per annum. He agreed that the costs and salaries would be divided between the British and Canadian governments, but the British share would come from a billion-dollar war gift from Canada. The Canadians found this acceptable. Howe and Mackenzie then travelled to London to finalise arrangements for the laboratory's governance. It was agreed that it would be run by a Policy Committee consisting of Howe and MacDonald and be administered by and funded through the NRC, with research directed by a Technical Committee chaired by Halban.|$|E
5|$|Suspension bridge using iron chains: Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that many early cultures employed the use of suspension bridges with <b>cabled</b> ropes, the first written evidence of iron chain suspension bridges comes from a local history and topography of Yunnan written in the 15th century, which describes the repair of an iron chain bridge during the reign of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424); although it is questionable if Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) Chinese claims that iron chain suspension bridges existed since the Han Dynasty, their existence in the 15th century predates that of anywhere else. K.S.
