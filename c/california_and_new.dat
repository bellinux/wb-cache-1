Brown, a dealer in Stradivarius instruments, arrived in Los Angeles in May 1928 with three of the famous maker's violins, including the Baron Knoop Stradivarius. In April 1929, Swedish swimmer Arne Borg, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Los Angeles on a world swimming tour, and in May, Sir James Gunnson, a former Mayor of Auckland, arrived for a one-month visit to promote increased trade between <b>California</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Zealand. The next January, Herbert Hagerman, former Governor of New Mexico Territory; author Basil Woon, who had been doing research for a Hawaiian story; and aviation promoter and chewing gum magnate William Easterwood all sailed stateside on the ship.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with a case}} of {{shingles}} in February 1981, Bobbi Campbell {{suffered a}} succession of unusual illnesses, including leukopenia later that summer. After hiking the Pinnacles National Monument with his boyfriend in September that year, he noticed on his feet lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), then {{thought of as a}} rare cancer of elderly Jewish men but with alarming numbers of cases appearing in <b>California</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York and now known to be closely associated with AIDS. He was formally diagnosed as having KS by dermatologist Marcus Conant on October 8, 1981. This would become Conant's first diagnosis of a patient with what would become known as AIDS; Campbell brought Conant a rose every year to commemorate the anniversary of his diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The Armenian Apostolic Church is {{the oldest}} {{national}} church in the world, and had {{a major role in}} protecting the Armenian identity through the centuries of foreign domination. Many Armenian communities in the country are concentrated around churches that serve as community centers. The first Armenian Apostolic church in America, named Church of Our Savior, was built in 1891 in Worcester. The American Diocese of the Church was established in 1898 by Catholicos Mkrtich Khrimian. In 1916 there were 34 Armenian parishes with 27,450 members with a predominantly male population. The top states with Armenian church followers were Massachusetts, Michigan, <b>California</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York. The Western Diocese was established in 1927.|$|E

5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{somewhat}} similar to {{elements of the}} 1946 French film version of Beauty and the Beast, which introduced the character of Avenant, an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston, as well as inanimate objects coming {{to life in the}} Beast's castle. The animated objects were, however, given distinct personalities in the Disney version. By early 1990, Katzenberg had approved the revised script, and storyboarding began again. The production flew story artists back and forth between <b>California</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York for storyboard approvals from Ashman, though the team was not told the reason why.|$|E
5|$|Virgin America secured U.S. investors Black Canyon Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners in late 2005. Once the {{new owners}} were on board, Virgin’s General Counsel {{submitted}} the required U.S. Department of Transportation certificate application on December 9, 2005. Unfortunately, despite significant {{public support for the}} new California-based airline, the approval process was mired with debate between the support and opposition of the new airline. City and state representatives from <b>California</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York led the support for the airline, while the biggest opposition came from a national aviation labor union, Air Line Pilots Association, as well as the pre-existing Houston, Texas-based competitor Continental Airlines. The review of Virgin America's application was prolonged due to this opposition, which claimed Virgin America, being a subsidiary of the United Kingdom-based Virgin Group, would not be under U.S. ownership or control. The application was initially denied by the Department of Transportation on December 27, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Ohio is {{commonly}} noted as the Nation's Industrial Capital, dating to {{its roots in}} the Rust Belt and Ohio's present-day intelligence and scientific dominance. Ohio was one of four states in the U.S. to have areas make the Intelligent Community Forum's list of global Smart 21 Communities for 2014, with Columbus, Ohio receiving the honors. The state has 5 of the top 115 colleges in the nation, according to U.S. News and World Report's 2010 rankings, while the Ohio State University was ranked #10 by the same magazine for awarding degrees to Fortune 500 CEOs. The state was ranked #8 by the same magazine in 2008 for best high schools, while overall, in 2010 the state's schools were ranked #5 in the country by Education Week. However, by 2016 the state's high school rankings had slipped to #11 according to U.S. News and World Report, and #22 overall in quality by Education Week in 2017. It was second only to Texas in having the most U.S. cities in the top 30 best places for new college graduates, according to BusinessWeek in 2010. The year ending July 2011 saw the state ranked fourth in the nation in job creation behind Texas, <b>California,</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York. By 2016 the state wasn't in the top 10 for job growth, and between 2015-2016, the state saw a decrease in job creation of 38,800. Since February 2010 state was 2.5% below the national average.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} of Terminator 2 spanned 171 days between October 9, 1990, and March 28, 1991, {{during which}} the crew filmed at the Mojave Desert before visiting 20 different sites throughout <b>California</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Mexico. These locations ran the gamut from the crowded Santa Monica Place shopping mall, where the two Terminators converged on John, with brief shots coming from the Westfield MainPlace and Los Cerritos Center, to flood control channels in the San Fernando Valley, which played host to the chase between the Terminators and John; a river had to be redirected to allow filming on the otherwise wet channels. Cameron and his crew also filmed Terminator 2 at The Corral Bar and the Lake View Medical Center (known as Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in the film), both located in Lake View Terrace. The external shots of Cyberdyne Systems Corporation were filmed on location at an office building {{on the corner of}} Gateway Boulevard and Bayside Parkway in Fremont, California. Working with up to 1,000 crew members, the production team oversaw numerous stunts and chase sequences, the most notable of which took place on the Los Angeles–Long Beach Terminal Island Freeway, prior to Terminator 2s climax. Tenmiles (16km) of electric cables were laid to illuminate the night-time chase, which saw a full-scale helicopter crash, a sliding tanker, and other elaborate paraphernalia.|$|E
