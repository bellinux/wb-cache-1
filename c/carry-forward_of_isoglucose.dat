50|$|For example, a tax asset {{may appear}} on the company's {{accounts}} due to losses in previous years (if <b>carry-forward</b> <b>of</b> tax losses is allowed). In this case a deferred tax asset should be recognised {{if and only if}} the management considered that there will be sufficient future taxable profit to utilise the tax loss. If it becomes clear that the company does not expect to make profits in future years, the value of the tax asset has been impaired: in the estimation of management, the likelihood that this tax loss can be utilised in the future has significantly fallen.|$|R
40|$|In Germany, the {{tax loss}} <b>carry-forward</b> <b>of</b> {{corporations}} significantly {{increased over the}} last decade. At the same time {{only a small percentage}} of losses have been effectively offset in the following periods. One potential reason for this puzzle is that stricter loss offset restrictions have been introduced in recent years. I use a newly developed micro simulation model for the corporate sector in Germany to evaluate the fiscal effects of these restrictions. Additionally, distributional breakdowns concerning the amounts <b>of</b> tax loss <b>carry-forward</b> and the effects of loss offset restrictions are provided. I find that the restrictions on the use of tax loss carryback are rather ineffective while the newly introduced minimum taxation considerably increases yearly tax revenue by 1. 1 billion 8 ̆ 0...|$|R
40|$|In this {{hermeneutic}} phenomenological study, {{we examined}} the experience of interprofessional collaboration {{from the perspective of}} nursing and medical students. Seventeen medical and nursing students from two different universities participated in the study. We used guiding questions in face-to-face, conversational interviews to explore students’ experience and expectations of interprofessional collaboration within learning situations. Three themes emerged from the data: the great divide, learning means content, and breaking the ice. The findings suggest that the experience of interprofessional collaboration within learning events is influenced by the natural clustering of shared interests among students. Furthermore, the <b>carry-forward</b> <b>of</b> impressions about physician–nurse relationships prior to the educational programs and during clinical placements dominate the formation of new relationships and acquisition of new knowledge about roles, which might have implications for future practice...|$|R
50|$|Badla was an {{indigenous}} carry-forward system invented on the Bombay Stock Exchange {{as a solution}} to the perpetual lack of liquidity in the secondary market. Badla were banned by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in 1993, effective March 1994, amid complaints from foreign investors, with the expectation that it would be replaced by a futures-and-options exchange. Such an exchange was not established and badla were legalized again in 1996 (with a <b>carry-forward</b> limit <b>of</b> Rs 200 million per broker) and banned again on 2 July 2001, following the introduction of futures contracts in 2000.|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. This {{study is}} {{designed}} around {{the hypothesis that}} a modular approach in teacher education, within an educationally sound curriculum framework, could indicate an appropriate route towards the possible implementation of several training models. Teacher education for the pre-primary school phase, {{as well as other}} differientiated training programmes, may be accommodated within this flexible approach. Viewed together with the implementation of a modular system is the implicit need for centralised administrative machinery. Associated fieldwork included the following: * Three focused study visits abroad (1982 - 1989) * A. literature search and survey of research projects followed by a systematic s tudy of relevant publications, documents relating to education policy issues and selected legislation * Close involvement with a local pre-primary teacher training project * Consultation along structured lines with academics, educational experts and individuals engaged at policy level. The most significant findings were: a) Both in the RSA and overseas teacher education programmes are currently under review. b) Teacher education models incorporating flexibility are being developed. This element of flexibility introduces, in addition to 'traditional admission requirements attached to a specific course, exit points with a <b>carry-forward</b> <b>of</b> credits already acquired. c) A modular approach to teacher education programmes is gaining favour rapidly within educational circles, and also in the sphere of manpower planning. Based on the findings,. several recommendations were made with regard to a modular curriculum for teacher education and more specifically with reference to the pre-primary school phase in the RSA...|$|R
50|$|The Collectivité St. Martin (French/North) tax {{environment}} The Collectivité is {{not authorized}} to vote in tax rules that are retroactive. Possibility for companies to obtain an official ruling (prise de position officielle) regarding their situation, which guarantees that the tax system applied to them will not be changed in the future. Existence of extensive jurisprudence rendered {{over a period of}} several decades by the French justice system, and which is nearly always transferable locally since local tax rules are, for the most part, based on concepts and definitions that are identical to those prescribed by tax laws in France.Company income tax: The tax base that is limited to profits made in Saint-Martin. Almost total exemption for dividends and capital gains on the sale of shareholdings. Rates of taxation: 10% or 20%. <b>Carry-forward</b> <b>of</b> losses that is unlimited in time and amount. A 10% tax rate for revenue from industrial property rights (patents, trademarks) and copyrights, as well as rights for the production of objects using 3D printing technology. A 10% tax rate for revenue from securities giving access to capital (convertible bonds, bonds with warrants).Tax-Free repatriation of profits: Absence of any withholding tax for payments to beneficiaries resident outside Saint-Martin, on dividends, interest, or royalties.Tax concessions for investment: “Tax exemption” scheme equivalent to a “tax holiday” system (exemption from corporate tax so long asthe aggregate amount of taxable income is less than the amount of productive investments made). Exemption from property tax for five years for new commercial premises. Reduced transfer tax on the acquisition of land for the purposes of priority activities.No tax on imports: Apart from a specific tax on petrol products, there is no duty charged on the introduction of goods into Collectivité territory. Similarly, the TGCA tax (an indirect tax similar in some ways to VAT) is not levied on the imports of goods.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a discrete-time framework for analyzing a firm's investment and financial choices under uncertainty. The investment decision is incremental {{and subject to}} a parameterized degree of irreversibility. Corporate taxes are asymmetric, but we allow imperfect <b>carry-forward</b> or carry-back <b>of</b> losses. Personal taxes are also levied. The paper focusses {{on the impact of}} various tax rules and corporate borrowing constraints on the firm's choices particularly the desired capital stock. The paper also highlights the effects of depreciation, interest rates, and personal taxes. Numerical simulations complement the analytical results to illustrate when taxes and borrowing constraints matter the most. Irreversible investment, corporate finance, assymetric taxation...|$|R
40|$|The House Republican Task Force on Tax Reform {{released}} its Blueprint for tax reform in June 2016, {{at the center}} of which is a destination-based cash-flow tax (DBCFT) to replace the current federal income tax on corporations. The House GOP Blueprint represents {{the first time that the}} DBCFT has been promoted by political leaders. Initial commentators have stressed the capacity of such a tax (if adopted in the U. S.) to reduce U. S. companies’ incentives for international tax planning and profit shifting, and to allow the U. S. to “leapfrog to the front of the pack” in its tax competitiveness. This essay discusses three key issues for understanding the DBCFT. First, I argue that we should not see the “perennial question” concerning border adjustments required by the tax as being about WTO-compatibility. Instead, the question should be whether we truly understand the DCFT’s potential impact on trade, aside from WTO legal concerns. In reality, key questions about the DBCFT’s distortionary trade effects have not been answered. Second, I examine how the loss <b>carry-forward</b> aspect <b>of</b> the Blueprint interacts with border adjustments, and argue that it creates a first-order implementation issue. Third, I show that the extension of destination-based taxation to non-corporate entities simultaneously (i) is necessary, (ii) produces no efficiency gains relative to the status quo, and (iii) renders pass-through taxation obsolete. The implementation issues for the DBCFT I highlight would not arise if the U. S. were to adopt a VAT instead. I conclude by comparing the DBCFT with the VAT in respect of the issue of progressivity, and considering how other countries would respond to a U. S. DBCFT...|$|R
40|$|In the 2016 ‑ 17 Budget, the Government {{announced}} {{a package of}} reforms designed to improve the sustainability, flexibility and integrity of the superannuation system. It set out a clear objective for superannuation: ‘to provide income in retirement to substitute or supplement the Age Pension’, which guided the superannuation changes.   Following extensive consultation, the Government decided to amend the package to provide greater support for Australians investing in their superannuation with the primary objective of providing an income in their retirement. The three changes announced by the Government on 15 September 2016 are to replace the lifetime non‑concessional contributions cap with lower annual caps for non‑concessional contributions, only available to people with balances less than $ 1. 6 million; defer commencement <b>of</b> <b>carry‑forward</b> arrangements for concessional contributions; and not proceed with measures to increase the flexibility for contributions for people aged 65 ‑ 74. This website sets out the Government’s reforms to the superannuation system. Better targeted tax concessions will make the superannuation system more sustainable as the population ages and fiscal pressures increase. Savings also enable reforms that allow the system to work better for all Australians and increase its flexibility to align with the changing work‑life patterns of modern Australia...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} 10 years, {{thanks to the}} {{worldwide}} energy liberalization process, the birth of competitive gas markets and the recent financial crisis, traditional long term swing contracts in Europe have been supplemented in a significant way by make-up clauses which allow postponing the withdrawal of gas to future years when it could be more profitable. This introduces more complexity in the pricing and optimal management of swing contracts. This paper is devoted to a proper quantitative modelization of one type of make-up clause in a gas swing contract. More in detail, we succeed in building an algorithm to price and optimally manage the make-up gas allocation among the years and the gas taking in the swing subperiods within the years: we prove that this problem has a quadratic complexity {{with respect to the}} number of years. The algorithm can be adapted to different instances of make-up clauses as well as to some forms <b>of</b> <b>carry-forward</b> clauses. Then, as an example, we show the algorithm at work on a 3 -year contract and we present a sensitivity analysis of the price and of the make-up policy with respect to various parameters relative both to the price dynamics and to the swing contract. To the authors' knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that such a quantitative treatment of make-up clauses appears in literature...|$|R
