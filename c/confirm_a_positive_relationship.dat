30|$|On {{education}} levels, {{the result}} {{shows that there}} is no significant difference among education levels on entrepreneurial intention of business student. This result is inconsistent with many previous studies <b>confirming</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>relationship</b> between education and entrepreneurship (Van der Sluis et al., 2004; Murphy, 2006; Birdthistle, 2008). In contrast, other studies argue that the relationship between university education in general and entrepreneurship is not so strong and contested (Galloway and Brown, 2002; Pittaway and Cope, 2007). Hence, the influence of education level on entrepreneurial intention still remains doubtful so it calls for further research in the field. This result also implies that government and higher education institutions should provide entrepreneurial supporting programs to any person who wish to start up rather than only base on their education level. Entrepreneurship should be nurtured in any educational environment; not necessarily only in formal education such as universities or colleges.|$|R
40|$|Entrepreneurship {{capital has}} been {{considered}} in the literature {{to be a public}} good, so it will positively affect a region’s total factor productivity. There is evidence <b>confirming</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>relationship</b> between entrepreneurship capital measures and regional production. This paper argues that the number of firms in a region will be positively related with the regional production in the presence of decreasing returns to scale in firms’ production technology. So if we do not control for the number of firms (and entrepreneurship capital is positively related with the stock of firms) we may be mixing both effects, returns to scale and public goods. This paper provides a methodological benchmark for distinguishing between both effects. The analysis conducted using a sample of 52 Spanish provinces for eleven years suggests major differences and conclusions between methodologies. In our data, previous methods overestimate the effect of regional entrepreneurship capital on the economy. ...|$|R

Based on evidence suggesting relationships between reading and empathy, between empathy and gender, and between reading and gender, the current study investigated the relationship between empathy and reading and how this relationship varies {{as a function of}} psychological gender. Canonical correlation analysis confirmed the relationship of reading behaviors and appreciation of reading to aspects of empathy. It also demonstrated the utility of investigating gender differences based not on physical, but psychological gender, and <b>confirmed</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>relationship</b> between femininity and empathy. Key among the findings was the discovery of <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>relationship</b> of psychological masculinity to cognitive empathy, amount of non-fiction reading, and appreciation of reading. The greater predictive power in psychological gender, which is more malleable than physical gender, counters sex stereotypes regarding empathy and reading behaviors; if men can be more like women in personality, they may also be more empathetic.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} weather effects on daily bus {{ridership}} in Brisbane, given bus’ dominance in this city. The weather pattern of Brisbane varies by season {{according to its}} sub-tropical climate characteristics. Bus is prone to inclement weather condition as it shares the road system with general traffic. Moreover, bus stops generally offer less or sometimes no protection from adverse weather. Hence, adverse weather conditions such as rain are conjectured to directly impact on daily travel behaviour patterns. There has been limited Australian research {{on the impact of}} weather on daily transit ridership. This study investigates the relationship between rainy day and daily bus ridership for the period of 2010 to 2012. Overall, rainfall affects negatively with varying impacts on different transit groups. However, this analysis <b>confirmed</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>relationship</b> between consecutive rainy days (rain continuing for 3 or more days).

Research purpose: The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the relationship between organisational trust and QWL. Motivation for the study: Recent organisational changes have refocused attention on the productivity and performance of sales representatives. These changes have brought about a re-evaluation of their QWL and the organisational trust they experience. Research design, approach and method: An Internet-based survey methodology was used to collect primary data from a probability sample of 282 sales representatives; a 72 % response rate was obtained. Responses were analysed using quantitative techniques and structural equation modelling. Main findings: Results <b>confirmed</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>relationship</b> between managerial practices with organisational trust and QWL and a lower relationship between the personality dimensions, organisational trust and the QWL. Practical/managerial implications: The study accentuated how important it is for management to be constantly aware of employees’ trust and their experience of a QWL, as these factors can lead to severe consequences if not properly managed. Contribution/value add: The study focused attention on the importance of building good trust relationships within an organisation, as it seems as though the personality traits and managerial practices of managers influence not only the trust relationship experienced by employees, but also their experience of a QWL. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Job {{crafting}} {{refers to}} the process of shaping one’s job characteristics to bring about greater satisfaction, engagement, and meaningfulness. Teachers need to craft their work continuously to effectively deal with the highly complex and demanding nature of their work. The study’s aim was to investigate the relationship between job crafting and subjective well-being amongst South African high school teachers, where subjective well-being comprised psychological meaningfulness and work engagement. The potential mediating effect that psychological meaningfulness had on the relationship between job crafting and work engagement amongst teachers was further explored. Using random sampling, a quantitative, cross-sectional survey design was used and administered to a sample of South African teachers situated in the Gauteng province (N = 251). The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES- 9 item), the Psychological Meaningfulness Scale (PMS), and the Job Crafting Scale (JCS) were employed. Structural equation modelling was utilised to assess the interrelationships between the main research constructs. In addition, standardised regression was used to test the mediating role of psychological meaningfulness. Results <b>confirmed</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>relationship</b> between job crafting, psychological meaningfulness, and work engagement. Furthermore, psychological meaningfulness mediated the relationship between job crafting and work engagement.
