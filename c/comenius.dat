25|$|According to Varsik, {{university}} was not closed by župan (mayor) {{of the city}} because local politician had not such competencies. Elisabeth University was founded in 1912 and began teaching only in 1914. The {{university was}} not the only Hungarian graduate school in the territory of contemporary Slovakia, but it had to serve to also all students from Upper Hungary inhabited by Slovak majority. However, in the compliance with education policy of Hungarian government which did not allow neither Slovak high schools, the university had not even department of Slovak language. In 1919, a new Czechoslovak university was founded in parallel and adopted space and limited inventory of unfinished faculty of medicine. Hungarian professors refused to promise loyalty to the new state necessary for teachers and state employees and were retired after providing of financial compensation. Thereafter, university was closed by official government decree and replaced by <b>Comenius</b> University which remained the only university in mid-war Slovakia also for majority population.|$|E

25|$|Iorga {{embarked}} on a longer journey during 1930: again lecturing in Paris during January, he left for Genoa and, from there, traveled to the United States, visiting some 20 cities, being greeted by the Romanian-American community and meeting with President Herbert Hoover. He was also an honored guest of Case Western Reserve University, where he delivered a lecture in English. Returning to attend the London International Congress of History, Iorga was also made a honoris causa doctor by the University of Oxford (with a reception speech likening him to both Livy and Pliny the Elder). That year, he also set up the Casa Romena institute in Venice. His new works included America și românii din America ("Romania and the Romanians of America") and Priveliști elvețiene ("Swiss Landscapes"), alongside the plays Sfântul Francisc ("Saint Francis") and Fiul cel pierdut ("The Lost Son"). In 1931–1932, he was made a honoris causa doctor by four other universities (the University of Paris, La Sapienza, Stefan Batory, <b>Comenius),</b> was admitted into both Accademia dei Lincei and the Accademia degli Arcadi, and published over 40 new titles per year.|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{graduate}} training for medical students in Martin dates back as 1962, {{to the times}} of Communist Czechoslovakia, when a detached workplace of the Faculty of Medicine of <b>Comenius</b> University in Bratislava was set up at the Martin hospital, which was by then a prominent center of graduate training for doctors. The first group of included 112 4th-year students, mostly from Bratislava and Košice, who began studying in the 1962/1963 academic year. The first graduation ceremony was held in 1965. However, {{it was not until}} 1967 that complete training in general medicine started.

2500|$|The {{structure}} of Waldorf education follows Steiner's theory of child development, which divides childhood into three developmental stages, and describes learning strategies appropriate to each stage.

2500|$|The name [...] "quman-dur" [...] means [...] "belonging to the Cumans" [...] or [...] "the dog of the Cumans", thus {{distinguishing}} it from {{a similar}} Hungarian sheepdog breed which later merged with the Komondor. The name Komondor is found {{for the first time}} written in 1544 in the History of King Astiagis by Kákonyi Péter, in Hungarian.

2500|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{engineering}} {{schools of the}} day, Lehigh was envisioned rather as a university instead of an [...] "institute of technology," [...] offering an education that was rooted in both scientific and classical traditions as espoused by John Amos <b>Comenius.</b> Initially there were five schools: four scientific (civil engineering, mechanical engineering, mining and metallurgy, and analytical chemistry) and one of general literature. The latter would shortly evolve into [...] "Courses in Arts and Science", as it was known then, {{in the first decade}} of the new Century. Engineering curricula were both merged and expanded.|$|E
2500|$|While {{struggling}} financially {{throughout her}} lifetime, Bathsua nonetheless was acquainted with well-known scholars and court members. It {{is not known}} whether Bathsua was in direct personal contact with Anna Maria van Schurman, yet the evidence of correspondence between the two and the mention of Bathsua in van Schurman's other correspondences alludes {{to the fact that}} the two scholars, both Royalists, respected each other and were on fairly intimate terms. In fact, Bathsua mentions van Schurman in her catalogue of learned women in An Essay. Bathsua was probably inspired by van Schurman's The Learned Maid; or, Whether a Maid may be a Scholar (translated in 1659), using van Schurman's treatise on women and girls' right to education as a model for her pro-educational tract, An Essay. Bathsua was also influenced by the work of John Amos <b>Comenius,</b> a prominent 17th-century scholar and educator, whom she would have been exposed to, either directly or indirectly, through her brother-in-law John Pell. Pell and his friends Samuel Hartlib and John Dury were [...] "England's leading Comenians, believing that implementing Comenian ideas would strengthen education and the common good". While there was little call for abolishing fixed gender and class hierarchies within the Comenian model, in An Essay, according to Patricia L. Hamilton, [...] "Makin champions pedagogical methods developed by Moravian educator John Amos <b>Comenius</b> and recommends that women be educated according to a broad curriculum—a mixture of classical and modern languages, history, mathematics and science, and issues related to domestic economy".|$|E
2500|$|In 1988 the Hungarian-English Bilingual Education {{program was}} {{introduced}} (as a four-year course of study, {{as opposed to}} five-year programs in other Hungarian schools), and in 2000 the Arany János Program for Talented Youth was initiated by the Hungarian Ministry of Education.

2500|$|Her tutor, Johannes Matthiae, {{influenced}} by John Dury and <b>Comenius,</b> who since 1638 {{had been working}} on a new Swedish school system, represented a gentler attitude than most Lutherans. In 1644, he suggested a new church order, but it was voted down as this was interpreted as Crypto-Calvinism. Queen Christina defended him against the advice of chancellor Oxenstierna, but three years later, the proposal had to be withdrawn. In 1647, the clergy wanted to introduce the Book of Concord (...) – a book defining correct Lutheranism versus heresy, making some aspects of free theological thinking impossible. Matthiae was strongly opposed to this and was again backed by Christina. The Book of Concord was not introduced.|$|E
2500|$|Jablonski {{was born}} in the village of Nassenhuben, near Danzig (Gdańsk, Poland). His father, Peter Figulus, was a {{minister}} of Unity of the Brethren ( [...] ; [...] – also known as [...] "Bohemian Brethren"); the son preferred the Bohemian surname Jablonski (Jablonský) which was based on his father's birthplace – Jablonné nad Orlicí. He was the younger brother of Johann Theodor Jablonski. His maternal grandfather, Johann Amos <b>Comenius</b> (d. 1670), was the last bishop of the Unity. Having studied at Frankfurt (Oder) and at Oxford, Jablonski entered upon his career as a preacher at Magdeburg in 1683, and then from 1686 to 1691 he {{was the head of the}} Brethren college at Polish Leszno (...) , a position which had been filled by his grandfather. Consecrated a bishop of the Unity for the churches in Poland, he was encouraged by the Elector Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg, King in Prussia, [...] to secure the Apostolic Succession to the Renewed Unity of Brethren, the Moravian Church, and consecrated David Nitschmann bishop in Berlin in 1735.|$|E
2500|$|Western {{interest}} {{in the study of}} languages began somewhat later than in the East, but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the Indic world. Early {{interest in}} language in the West was a part of philosophy, not of grammatical description. The first insights into semantic theory were made by Plato in his Cratylus dialogue, where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas. This work is the first to use the word etymology to describe the history of a word's meaning. Around 280 BC, one of Alexander the Great's successors founded a university (see Musaeum) in Alexandria, where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in and taught Greek to speakers of other languages. While this school was the first to use the word [...] "grammar" [...] in its modern sense, Plato had used the word in its original meaning as [...] "téchnē grammatikḗ" [...] (...) , the [...] "art of writing", which is also the title {{of one of the most}} important works of the Alexandrine school by Dionysius Thrax. Throughout the Middle Ages, the study of language was subsumed under the topic of philology, the study of ancient languages and texts, practised by such educators as Roger Ascham, Wolfgang Ratke, and John Amos <b>Comenius.</b>|$|E
60|$|On the whole, Herbert Spencer {{has been}} {{fortunate}} among educational philosophers. He {{has not had}} to wait so long for the acceptance of his teachings as <b>Comenius,</b> Montaigne, or Rousseau waited.

60|$|However, {{she went}} to work as best she could in her cool corner, {{guessing}} at many of the words by lights derived from <b>Comenius,</b> and had just made out that the chief ingredients were pounded pearls and rubies, mixed with white of eggs laid by pullets under a year old, during the waxing of the April moon, when she heard voices chattering in the hall, and a girlish figure appeared in a light cloak and calash, whom Loveday seemed to be guiding, and yet keeping as much repressed as she could.|$|E
60|$|The man who propounded {{this idea}} {{was a certain}} great Bohemian, Komensky, who is perhaps better known in our western world by his Latinized name <b>Comenius.</b> He professed himself the pupil of Bacon. He was the friend of Milton. He {{travelled}} from one European country to another with his political and educational ideas. For a time he thought of coming to America. It is a great pity that he never came. And his idea, the particular idea of his {{we are going to}} discuss, was the idea of a common book, a book of history, science and wisdom, which should form the basis and framework for the thoughts and imaginations of every citizen in the world.|$|E
