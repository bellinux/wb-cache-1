50|$|Crimp {{connections}} are used typically to fix connectors, such as BNC connectors, to coaxial cables quickly, {{as an alternative}} to soldered connections. Typically the male connector is crimp-fitted to a cable, and the female attached, often using soldered connections, to a panel on equipment. A special power or manual tool is used to fit the <b>connector.</b> <b>Wire</b> strippers which strip outer jacket, shield braid, and inner insulation to the correct lengths in one operation are used to prepare the cable for crimping.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Currently in Korea, {{the simple}} {{catenary}} type {{overhead contact line}} system is being applied to both conventional lines and high speed lines of electric railway, and circulation current flowing into the catenary system frequently bring undesirable consequences. Namely, the <b>connector</b> <b>wire</b> has many problems according to a flow of excessive circulation current and arc current on catenary when an electric train runs at high speed. This paper presents the development and application of a real-time data acquisition system designed to measure the electrical characteristics of an overhead catenary system in electric railways. The developed system is capable of storing data of a 25 kV power source in a live wire state through a telemetry environment. The field test {{results show that the}} proposed technique and the developed system can be practically applied to measure characteristics of current of an overhea...|$|E
5000|$|A 10BASE-T or 100BASE-TX node {{such as a}} PC uses a <b>connector</b> <b>wiring</b> called medium {{dependent}} interfaces (MDI), transmitting on pin 1 and 2 {{and receiving}} on pin 3 and 6 to a network device. An infrastructure node (a hub or a switch) accordingly uses a <b>connector</b> <b>wiring</b> called MDI-X, transmitting on pin 3 and 6 and receiving on pin 1 and 2. These ports are connected using a [...] "straight-through" [...] cable, so each transmitter talks to the receiver on the other side.|$|R

5000|$|For {{full-duplex}} {{communication between}} two devices, {{two pairs of}} wires would be used. There is no common standard for current loop interfaces, so details such as timing, <b>connectors,</b> <b>wire</b> color codes, and so on, are all application specific.|$|R
5000|$|The current {{version of}} that standard, called TIA-968-A, {{specifies}} the modular connectors at length, but not the wiring. Instead, TIA-968-A incorporates a standard called T1.TR5-1999, [...] "Network and Customer Installation Interface <b>Connector</b> <b>Wiring</b> Configuration Catalog", by reference to specify the wiring. With the publication of TIA-968-B, the connector descriptions have been moved to TIA-1096-A. Note that a registered jack name such as RJ11 identifies both the physical <b>connectors</b> and the <b>wiring</b> (pinout) of it (see above).|$|R

50|$|Solid {{aluminum}} conductors {{were originally}} {{made in the}} 1960s from a utility grade aluminum alloy that had undesirable properties for a building wire, and were used with wiring devices intended for copper conductors. These practices were found to cause defective connections and potential fire hazards. In the early-1970s new aluminum wire made from one of several special alloys was introduced, and all devices — breakers, switches, receptacles, splice <b>connectors,</b> <b>wire</b> nuts, etc. — were specially designed for the purpose. These newer aluminum wires and special designs address problems with junctions between dissimilar metals, oxidation on metal surfaces and mechanical effects that occur as different metals expand at different rates with increases in temperature.|$|R

50|$|The Macintosh 128K, Macintosh 512K and Macintosh Plus from Apple {{as well as}} the Amiga 1000 from Commodore used 4P4C {{connectors}} {{to connect}} the keyboard to the main computer housing. The connector provided power to the keyboard on the outer two contacts and received data signals on the inner pair. The cable between the computer and the keyboard was a coiled cord with an appearance very similar to a telephone handset cable. The connector on the Amiga 1000 used crossover wiring, similar to a telephone handset. The <b>connector</b> <b>wiring</b> on the Apple computers, however, required a polarized straight through pinout. Using a telephone handset cable instead of the supplied cable could short out the +5 volt DC supply and damage the Apple computer or the keyboard.|$|R
