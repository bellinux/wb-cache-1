40|$|In this study, the {{recovery}} of <b>casing</b> <b>soil</b> consumed in the white button mushroom was investigated. <b>Casing</b> <b>soil</b> {{is used as a}} layer on compost (culture medium) to a diameter of 3 - 5 to stimulate fruiting on the white button mushroom(Agaricus bisporus). The expense od <b>casing</b> <b>soil</b> is about 30 percent of production costs. In the first step of this experiment, in order to separate <b>casing</b> <b>soil</b> from compost easily (at the end of production period),by distribution of a mesh with pores of 5 mm between compost and <b>casing</b> <b>soil</b> in the casing step, which we could separate and easily collect <b>casing</b> <b>soil</b> at the end. The most important altering factor between chemical and physical properties of recycling <b>casing</b> <b>soil,</b> is EC that was reduced by leaching process. An experiment was conducted based on split plot design with two factors and three replications. The main plots were treated with two levels of with and without a plastic mesh.

40|$|Abstract – The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effects of six bacterial strains isolated from Agaricus blazei (ABM) on its cultivation. The six strains were characterized as to their effects on the productivity, polysaccharide-protein complex (PSPC), and polysaccharide contents of ABM cultured on sterilized casing soils. Three isolates enhanced ABM mycelium growth. Inoculation of Arthrobacter sp. or Exiguobacterium sp. on sterile peat <b>casing</b> <b>soil</b> resulted in 64 % increase in ABM mushroom total fresh matter yield compared to the uninoculated control. Inoculation of Exiguobacterium sp., Microbacterium esteraromaticum or Pseudomonas resinovorans on sterilized loamy <b>casing</b> <b>soil</b> resulted in 62, 95, and 59 % increase in ABM mushroom total fresh matter yield, respectively. The PSPC content in ABM increased 7 to 10 % in <b>casing</b> <b>soil</b> inoculated with {{five of the six}} isolates compared to the uninoculated control. Exiguobacterium sp. inoculated on <b>casing</b> <b>soil</b> resulted in a mushroom‑polysaccharide content 15 % higher than the control.

Full interaction between the turbine-generator set, the foundation superstructure, and the soil medium, is considered.;A hybrid method is proposed to establish the mathematical model for the turbine-generator-foundation system, which includes finite element discretization of turbine-generator and foundation superstructure, combined with a soil stiffness matrix derived from the dynamic Green functions of the soil. The soil is modeled as a transversely isotropic layered medium over a rigid bedrock. The analysis is conducted in frequency domain through complex frequency response analysis. The response in time domain is obtained by Fourier transform. The seismic excitation is represented as the control motion on the ground surface, which is generated as an artificial earthquake.

40|$|AbstractContinental flood basalts {{represent}} one of {{the largest}} geologic structures on earth but have received comparatively little attention for geologic storage of CO 2. Flood basalt lava flows have flow tops that are porous, permeable, and have large potential capacity for storage of CO 2. In appropriate geologic settings, interbedded sediment layers and dense low-permeability basalt rock flow interior sections may act as effective seals allowing time for mineralization reactions to occur. Previous laboratory experiments showed the relatively rapid chemical reaction of CO 2 -saturated pore water with basalts to form stable carbonate minerals. However, recent laboratory tests with water-saturated supercritical CO 2 show that mineralization reactions occur in this phase as well, providing a second and potentially more important mineralization pathway than was previously understood. Field testing of these concepts is proceeding with drilling of the world's first supercritical CO 2 injection well in flood basalt being completed in May 2009 near the township of Wallula in Washington State and corresponding CO 2 injection permit granted by the State of Washington in March 2011. Injection of a nominal 1000 MT of CO 2 was completed in August 2013 and site monitoring is in progress. Well logging conducted immediately after injection termination confirmed the presence of CO 2 predominantly within the upper flow top region, and showed no evidence of vertical CO 2 migration outside the well <b>casing.</b> Shallow <b>soil</b> gas samples collected around the injection well show no evidence of leakage and fluid and gas samples collected from the injection zone show strongly elevated concentrations of Ca, Mg, Mn, and Fe and 13 C/ 18 O isotopic shifts that are consistent with basalt-water chemical reactions.

The maximum length of stalk was recorded from sugarcane leaf, while diameter of stalk and pileus, and thickness of pileus were found in rice straw substrate. The highest biological and economic yield, and biological efficiency were also obtained in the rice straw substrate. Cow dung and loamy soil, farm-yard manure, loamy soil and sand, and spent oyster mushroom substrates were used as casing materials to evaluate the yield and yield-contributing characteristics of C. indica. The results indicate that the number of effective fruiting bodies, the biological and economic yield, and the biological efficiency were statistically sim-ilar all of the casing materials used. The maximum biological efficiency was found in the cow dung and loamy <b>soil</b> <b>casing</b> material. The cow dung and loamy soil (3 cm thick) was the best casing material and the rice straw was the best substrat...|$|R
40|$|Eighty-one {{water samples}} were {{collected}} from wells in the Boone-St. Joe limestone aquifer of northwest Arkansas and analyzed for fecal coliform, fecal streptococcus, total coliform bacteria, chloride, phosphate, nitrate and sulfate to determine the degree of contamination. Forty-nine percent of the samples had fecal streptococcus counts greater than 1 colony per 100 ml, 68 % had total coliform counts of 1 or more colonies per 100 ml, and 9 % of the wells had fecal coliform counts of 1 or more colonies per 100 ml. Water from wells in Clarksville, Nixa, Noark, Tonti and Waben cherty silt loam soils showed from 83 to 100 % bacterial contamination. Nitrate concentrations exceeded 45 ppm in 80 % of the wells in Waben soils and in 50 % of wells in Nixa soils, with wells in the other soil types having nitrate concentrations of less than 45 ppm. Nitrate, sulfate, and chloride concentrations were all found to be statistically related. Wells closest to chicken houses {{were found to have}} statistically greater choloride concentrations. Chloride was also found to be statistically greater in wells with shallow casing. Wells within 150 meters of a photo-lineament were found to have greater fecal coliform contamination than wells farther away. The results indicate the ease at which wells can be contaminated with only shallow <b>casing,</b> in cherty <b>soils,</b> and/or near chicken houses or fractures (photo-lineaments...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolation}} of bacteria {{was carried out}} from samples of straw and chicken manure, compost at various stages of the composting process and <b>casing</b> <b>soil</b> used for growing button mushrooms. A preliminary screening of 108 bacterial isolates for antagonistic activity against Trichoderma aggressivum f. europaeum showed that 23 tested isolates inhibited mycelial growth of the pathogenic fungus. Further screening with four indicator isolates of fungi revealed that all 23 bacterial isolates inhibited the growth of T. aggressivum f. europaeum, T. harzianum and T. koningii, while only 13 isolates inhibited the growth of T. atroviride. T. aggressivum f. europaeum {{proved to be the}} most sensitive, with many bacterial isolates generating a high percentage of growth inhibition. Only two bacterial isolates (B- 129 and B- 268) were successful in inhibiting the growth of all 4 tested pathogens. All 23 bacterial isolates were characterized as Gram-positive and catalase-positive and were subjected to molecular identification based on the partial sequence, the hypervariant region of the 16 S rDNA. It was shown that the obtained bacterial strains belong to Bacillus subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. licheniformis and B. pumilus species.

40|$|Outbreaks of {{wet bubble}} disease (WBD) caused by Mycogone perniciosa are {{increasing}} {{across the world}} and seriously affecting the yield of Agaricus bisporus. However, highly WBD-resistant strains are rare. Here, we tested 28 A. bisporus strains for WBD resistance by inoculating M. perniciosa spore suspension on <b>casing</b> <b>soil,</b> and assessed genetic diversity of these strains using 17 new simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers developed in this study. We found that 10 wild strains originating from the Tibetan Plateau in China were highly WBD-resistant strains, and 13 cultivated strains from six countries were highly susceptible strains. A total of 88 alleles were detected in these 28 strains, and the observed number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 8. Cluster and genetic structure analysis results revealed the wild resources from China have a relatively high level of genetic diversity and occur at low level of gene flow and introgression with cultivated strains. Moreover, the wild strains from China potentially have the consensus ancestral genotypes different from the cultivated strains and evolved independently. Therefore, the highly WBD-resistant wild strains from China and newly developed SSR markers {{could be used as}} novel sources for WBD-resistant breeding and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of WBD-resistant gene of A. bisporus...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze yields, {{biological}} efficiency, earliness (expressed as days to first harvest), and precociousness and establish models for the mushroom growing according to these parameters. The experiment followed a double factorial design with four sources of calcium (calcitic limestone, calcitic limestone + gypsum, dolomitic limestone and dolomitic limestone + gypsum) and 2 application times (25 days before casing and at the moment of casing), with 4 replicates for each treatment. Different calcium sources influenced differently Agaricus subrufescens production, especially as regards earliness, which showed significantly higher values when dolomitic limestone with gypsum was applied. Yield and biological efficiency were negatively correlated with H + AL, organic matter and Mg amount. Furthermore, earliness was positively correlated with H + Al, organic matter, and the amount of Mg and Fe. Finally, negative correlations were observed between precociousness and the amount of Ca, SB (sum of base), CEC (cation exchange capacity) and V% (percentage of base saturation). The models presented in this work are extremely important for predicting the agronomic performance of Agaricus subrufescens on the basis of chemical analysis provided by the <b>casing</b> <b>soil.</b> (c) 2012 King Saud University.

40|$|When a rigid shaft {{such as a}} jacked pile or {{the sleeve}} of a cone {{penetrometer}} penetrates soil, the soil mass at the shaft tip fails. This failed soil mass flows around the shaft surface and creates a disturbed soil zone. The soil in this zone, which is at a failure or critical state (CS), flows and behaves like a viscous fluid. During continuous penetration, the shaft surface is subjected to an additional viscous shear stress above the static shear stress (interfacial solid friction). The total resistance on the shaft in motion {{is due to the}} static and viscous shear components. Current methods of calculating the penetration resistance in soils are based on static interfacial friction, which determine the force required to cause failure at the shaft-soil interface and not the viscous drag. The main aim of this research is to understand the viscous soil resistance on penetrating shafts in clays. This research consists of two components. First, a theoretical analysis based on creeping flow hydrodynamics is developed to study the viscous drag on the shaft. The results of this analysis reveal that the size of the CS zone, the shear viscosity of the soil and velocity of the shaft influence the viscous drag stress. Large increases in viscous drag occur when the size of the CS zone is less than four times the shaft radius. Second, a new experimental procedure to estimate the shear viscosity of clays with water contents less than the liquid limit is developed. Shear viscosity is the desired soil parameter to estimate viscous drag. However, there is no standard method to determine shear viscosity of clays with low water contents (or Liquidity Index, LI). Soils can reach CS for water contents in the plastic range (LI< 1) and exhibit viscous behavior. The fall cone test is widely used to interpret the index (liquid and plastic limit) and strength properties of clays. In this study the existing analysis of the fall cone test is reexamined to discern the viscous drag as the cone penetrates the soil. This reexamination shows that the shear viscosity of clays with low water contents (LI< 1. 5) can be estimated from time-penetration data of the fall cone. Fall cone test results on kaolin show that the shear viscosity decreases exponentially with an increase in LI. The results of this research can be used to understand practical problems such as jacked piles in clays, cone penetrometer sleeve resistance and advancement of <b>casings</b> in <b>soil</b> for drilling or tunneling operations...|$|R
40|$|This {{sampling}} and analysis plan (SAP) is the primary document describing field and laboratory activities and requirements for the tank 241 -AX- 104 upper vadose zone cone penetrometer (CP) demonstration. It is written in accordance with Hanford Tank Initiative Tank 241 -AX- 104 Upper Vadose Zone Demonstration Data Quality Objective (Banning 1999). This technology demonstration, to be conducted at tank 241 -AX- 104, is being performed by the Hanford Tanks Initiative (HTI) Project {{as a part of}} Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) Retrieval Program (EM- 30) and the Office of Science and Technology (EM- 50) Tanks Focus Area. Sample results obtained as part of this demonstration will provide additional information for subsequent revisions to the Retrieval Performance Evaluation (RPE) report (Jacobs 1998). The RPE Report is the result of an evaluation of a single tank farm (AX Tank Farm) used as the basis for demonstrating a methodology for developing the data and analyses necessary to support making tank waste retrieval decisions within the context of tank farm closure requirements. The RPE includes a study of vadose zone contaminant transport mechanisms, including analysis of projected tank leak characteristics, hydrogeologic characteristics of tank farm soils, and the observed distribution of contaminants in the vadose zone in the tank farms. With limited characterization information available, large uncertainties exist as to {{the nature and extent of}} contaminants that may exist in the upper vadose zone in the AX Tank Farm. Traditionally, data has been collected from soils in the vadose zone through the installation of boreholes and wells. Soil samples are collected as the bore hole is advanced and samples are screened on site and/or sent to a laboratory for analysis. Some in-situ geophysical methods of contaminant analysis can be used to evaluate radionuclide levels in the soils adjacent to an existing borehole. However, geophysical methods require compensation for well <b>casing</b> interference and <b>soil</b> moisture content and may not be successful in some conditions. In some cases the level of interference must be estimated due to uncertainties regarding the materials used in well construction and <b>soil</b> conditions, Well <b>casing</b> deployment used for many in-situ geophysical methods is relatively expensive and geophysical methods do not generally provide real time values for contaminants. In addition, some of these methods are not practical within the boundaries of the tank farm due to physical constraints, such as underground piping and other hardware. The CP technologies could facilitate future characterization of vadose zone soils by providing vadose zone data in near real-time, reducing the number of soil samples and boreholes required, and reducing characterization costs...|$|R
40|$|Mushroom {{cultivation}} is {{a direct}} utilization of their ecological role of organic matter degradation in the bioconversion of solid wastes generated from industry and agriculture into edible biomass, which could also {{be regarded as a}} functional food or as a source of drugs and pharmaceuticals. Significant changes are expected in the integrated management of wastes streams in the future due to the use of plant biomass for biofuel and energy production and other non-food crops. On the one hand these activities may use the same wastes than those allowing mushroom cultivation today and problem of competition for supplying may occur. On the other hand these new activities will generate new wastes to be treated and valorise by the mushroom industry. Horse manure is a component of the compost used to grow the button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus and other Agaricus species. We studied the methanisation of horse manure and utilisation of the digestate produced by the biogas reactor as waste for growing A. bisporus. Methanisation was efficient and the compost obtained from the digestate in mixture with wheat straw and low quantities of mushroom compost as source of aerobic and thermophilic microflora allowed to grow A. bisporus, but with lower yields than in conventional mushroom composts. Horse manure methanisation digestate was also used without composting by incorporation into the compost at spawning compared to a proteinic supplementation and in the preparation of <b>casing</b> <b>soil</b> in substitution of a part of peat moss. No beneficial effect was observed and with increasing rate of digestate incorporated, negative effect appeared (unproductive area) ...|$|E
