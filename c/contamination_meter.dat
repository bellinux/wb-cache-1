2500|$|Due to {{frustration}} with TEPCO and the Japanese government [...] "providing differing, confusing, {{and at times}} contradictory, information on critical health issues" [...] a citizen's group called [...] "Safecast" [...] recorded detailed radiation level data in Japan. The Japanese government [...] "does not consider nongovernment readings to be authentic". The group uses off-the-shelf Geiger counter equipment. A simple Geiger counter is a <b>contamination</b> <b>meter</b> and not a dose rate meter. The response differs too much between different radioisotopes to permit a simple GM tube for dose rate measurements when more than one radioisotope is present. A thin metal shield is needed around a GM tube to provide energy compensation to enable it {{to be used for}} dose rate measurements. For gamma emitters either an ionization chamber, a gamma spectrometer or an energy compensated GM tube are required. Members of the Air Monitoring station facility at the Department of Nuclear Engineering at the University of Berkeley, California have tested many environmental samples in Northern California.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{large scale}} British civil defence issue was the Geiger-Müller counter <b>Meter,</b> <b>Contamination,</b> No. 1 set — stock number [...] "5CG0012", of 1953. It had 0-10 mR/hour range with {{external}} probe and headphones. This {{was designed to}} use two 1.50 volt batteries, although later they were fitted with an inverter which used four 1.35 volt mercury cells or, alternatively, a mains electricity power pack. Many of these units remained in service until the 1980s. There was also a Mk. 2 model which used rubber connectors and cable for the probe unit, compared to the Plessey connectors of the Mk.1.|$|R
5000|$|The bGeigie Nano is {{available}} as a kit, so the user needs {{to learn how to}} solder in order to build it from the supplied parts. The kit can be purchased from the Kithub product page. The device was developed in collaboration with International Medcom Inc. and shares some parts with their Inspector Alert™ detector. According to the Safecast Github page [...] "bGeigie Nano is a lighter version of the bGeigie Mini using an Arduino Fio, a GpsBee, an OpenLog and an Inspector Alert geiger counter. The aim is to make everything fit in a Pelican Micro Case 1040".The final version of the bGeigie is placed inside the smaller Pelican Micro Case 1010. It features the LND 7317 pancake Geiger-Mueller tube type detector, a GPS receiver and is expandable with a Bluetooth module. The mode switch offers choice between geotagged radiation logging (data saved to microSD card) and measuring without GPS - showing also Bq/m2 (Cs137) values. Inside the case the unit is calibrated for gamma radiation. The main unit taken out of its case will additionally do α- and β-detection for careful use as a surface <b>contamination</b> spot <b>meter.</b>|$|R
