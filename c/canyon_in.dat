5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York City, they stayed {{for several days}} and an exhibition game was organised. The match was played in Brooklyn and {{was supposed to be}} New Zealand versus New York, however several New Zealanders played for New York to make up their numbers. Despite this New Zealand won the match. The team then travelled to San Francisco, via the Niagara Falls, Chicago, and the Grand <b>Canyon.</b> <b>In</b> San Francisco they played two matches against British Columbia; the first won 43–6 and the second 65–6. From there they sailed back to New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} centuries A.D., Colorado River basin peoples began to form large agriculture-based societies, some of which lasted {{hundreds}} of years and grew into well-organized civilizations encompassing {{tens of thousands of}} inhabitants. The Ancient Puebloan (also known as Anasazi or Hisatsinom) people of the Four Corners region were descended from the Desert Archaic culture. The Puebloan people developed a complex distribution system to supply drinking and irrigation water in Chaco <b>Canyon</b> <b>in</b> northwestern New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Driving {{through the}} east side of Zion to U.S. Route 89 allows access to Bryce Canyon National Park in the north or to the north rim of the Grand <b>Canyon</b> <b>in</b> the south. Due to the narrowness of the Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel, RVs and buses must obtain a special pass and can only drive through the tunnel during limited hours.|$|E

5|$|Glenwood Canyon {{has served}} as the primary {{transportation}} artery through the Rocky Mountains, even before the creation of U.S. highways. Railroads have used the canyon since 1887 and a dirt road was built through the <b>canyon</b> <b>in</b> the early 20th century. The first paved road was built from 1936 to 1938 at a cost of $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million today).|$|E
5|$|The Yosemite Valley Railroad, {{originally}} {{established with}} the discovery of mineral deposits in Yosemite Valley and Merced Canyon, continued functioning through the early 20th century carrying tourists to Yosemite Valley along the Merced River. El Portal Road, constructed through Merced <b>Canyon</b> <b>in</b> 1926, put an end to passenger service on the railway, but operations continued until the mid-1940s, when major flooding occurred, destroying sections of the railroad.|$|E
5|$|The city of Skopje {{comprises}} two artificial lakes, {{located on}} the Treska.

Three small natural lakes can be found near Smiljkovci, on the northeastern edge of the urban area.|$|E

5|$|The {{experiments}} were {{performed in the}} Bayo <b>Canyon</b> <b>in</b> a location designated TA-10 ("Technical Area 10") (but more {{commonly referred to as}} the Bayo Canyon Site) in Los Alamos County and close to the border with Santa Fe County, northeast from the Los Alamos townsite. The site had several fixed structures. The lanthanum-140 was isolated in a radiochemistry building, TA-10-1. There were four firing sites. The instruments for firing the explosives and recording the data were housed in two detonation control buildings (TA-10-13 and TA-10-15).|$|E
5|$|The first formal {{excavation}} of Chetro Ketl was conducted during 1920 and 1921 by Edgar L. Hewett, director of Chaco Canyon's first archeological field school. He visited the <b>canyon</b> <b>in</b> 1902, and in 1916 he {{arranged for the}} School of American Research to participate in excavations at Chetro Ketl with the Royal Ontario Museum and the Smithsonian Institution. He made some preliminary studies {{at the end of}} 1916, but World War I caused the delay of his plans. When work resumed in 1920, financial considerations forced the Smithsonian to withdraw its support.|$|E

5|$|The {{floor of}} Zion Canyon was settled in 1863 by Isaac Behunin, who farmed corn, tobacco, and fruit trees. The Behunin {{family lived in}} Zion Canyon {{near the site of}} today's Zion Lodge during the summer, and wintered in Springdale. Behunin is {{credited}} with naming Zion, a reference to a place of peace mentioned in the Bible. Two more families settled Zion <b>Canyon</b> <b>in</b> the next couple of years, bringing with them cattle and other domesticated animals. The canyon floor was farmed until Zion became a Monument in 1909.|$|E
5|$|Three deep canyons {{are located}} in the park, cut through the {{volcanic}} tuff of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640,000years. The Lewis River flows through Lewis <b>Canyon</b> <b>in</b> the south, and the Yellowstone River has carved two colorful canyons, the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and the Black Canyon of the Yellowstone in its journey north.|$|E
5|$|While at Coldwater <b>Canyon</b> <b>in</b> 1977, Cagney had a minor stroke. After {{two weeks}} in the hospital, Zimmermann became his {{full-time}} caregiver, traveling with Billie Vernon and him wherever they went. After the stroke, Cagney was no longer able to undertake many of his favorite pastimes, including horseback riding and dancing, and as he became more depressed, he even gave up painting. Encouraged by his wife and Zimmermann, Cagney accepted an offer from the director Miloš Forman to star in a small but pivotal role in the film Ragtime (1981).|$|E

5|$|As it {{continues}} through the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, SR 133 follows a four-lane alignment {{on the west}} side of the canyon, moved from the old two-lane road in the center of the <b>canyon</b> <b>in</b> late 2006. Laguna Canyon Road splits to the northwest where the canyon ends in Irvine. North of the park, the highway becomes the Laguna Freeway after crossing an at-grade intersection with Laguna Canyon Road, followed by an interchange at exit 8, San Diego Freeway (I-405). SR 133 then continues as a freeway and serves Barranca Parkway and the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5). After crossing I-5, SR 133 becomes part of the Eastern Toll Road along the northwest side of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, crossing an interchange with Irvine Boulevard at exit 12 before ending at SR 241.|$|E
5|$|In late Precambrian time, {{extension}} {{from a large}} {{tectonic plate}} or smaller plates moving away from Laurentia thinned its continental crust, forming large rift basins that would ultimately fail to split the continent. Eventually, this sunken region of Laurentia was flooded with a shallow seaway that extended from at least present-day Lake Superior to Glacier National Park in Montana to the Grand Canyon and the Uinta Mountains. The resulting Grand Canyon Supergroup of sedimentary units is composed of nine varied geologic formations that were laid down from 1.2billion and 740million years ago in this sea. Good exposures of the supergroup {{can be seen in}} eastern Grand <b>Canyon</b> <b>in</b> the Inner Gorge and from Desert View, Lipan Point and Moran point.|$|E
5|$|New Melones was {{the focus}} of a long {{environmental}} battle during the 1970s and early 1980s; critics protested the flooding of a long scenic stretch of the Stanislaus River, which flowed over whitewater rapids through the deepest limestone <b>canyon</b> <b>in</b> the western United States. The protestors employed a variety of methods, some extreme, to prevent the filling of New Melones Lake until 1983, when record-setting floods filled the reservoir and nearly breached the dam's emergency spillway. The fight over New Melones galvanized the river conservation movement in California and influenced major water policy changes on the state and federal levels; since its completion, no other dams of its size or importance have been built in the United States.|$|E
