50|$|This {{technique}} is mostly used for Dyneema ropes. The principle of a Dyneema eye is a core-to-core splice, {{in which a}} length of at least 60 times {{the diameter of the}} rope is taken back into itself. DSM advises using 60 times the diameter for coated Dyneema, and 100 times the diameter for uncoated Dyneema. For 6mm <b>coated</b> <b>rope,</b> this would mean 36 cm. Under tension the rope will pull into itself tightly, which produces a strong eye. One can pull out the eye when the rope is not under tension, unless one makes a lock-splice (also called brummel splice).|$|E
5000|$|Pylaiella (mung) is a genus of seaweed (brown algae) {{that can}} be a {{nuisance}} due to its ability to <b>coat</b> people, <b>ropes,</b> animals, and more when it blooms close to the shore under particular conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{types of}} rope must be {{protected}} from rot by tarring, <b>coating</b> the <b>rope</b> with tar. [...] Hemp rope requires tarring, but Manila, cotton, and synthetics do not. Regular tarring at sea was required when sailing ships used hemp rope.|$|R
25|$|PVC coating placed onto {{wire rope}} and {{aircraft}} cable {{is used for}} general purpose applications. The coating process consists of a jacketing application via pressurized extrusion. The benefits of PVC <b>coating</b> on wire <b>rope</b> are for not only aesthetics, but for ergonomics, abrasion protection and visibility. It is found {{in a variety of}} industries and environments both indoor and out.|$|R
50|$|In October 2009, Studio Wieki Somers won the Golden Eye (the {{award for}} best Dutch design) at the Dutch Design Awards with the Merry-go-round Coat Rack, {{designed}} for the cloakroom of Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. By pulling <b>ropes,</b> <b>coats</b> are raised onto the carousel-like construction, making them appear to be floating in space. The coat rack was also nominated in 2009 at the London Design Museum's Designs of the Year awards.|$|R
60|$|Immediately upon {{entering}} Quebec, James had purchased a large turn-screw, some ten yards of fine but strong rope, and {{three or four}} bladders. When he procured the order, {{he went to his}} cabin, took off his <b>coat,</b> wound the <b>rope</b> round his body, and then, putting on his coat, placed the flattened bladders under it and buttoned it up, slipping the turn-screw up his sleeve, and then proceeded to the prisoner's cabin. The sentry at once admitted him, on producing the admiral's order.|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, he {{tore off}} his <b>coat,</b> tied a <b>rope</b> round his waist, flung his {{boots on the}} sand, and girded himself rapidly with an {{inflated}} life-buoy. Then, before the men could seize him or prevent the rash attempt, he had dashed into the great waves that curled and thundered on the beach, and was struggling hard with the sea in a life and death contest. Eustace Le Neve held the rope, and tried to aid him in his endeavors. He had meant to plunge in himself, but Walter Tyrrel was beforehand with him. He was no match in a race against time for the fiery and impetuous Cornish temperament. It wasn't long, however, before the breakers proved themselves more than equal foes for Walter Tyrrel. In another minute he was pounded and pummeled on the unseen rocks under water by the great curling billows. They seized him resistlessly on their crests, tumbled him over like a child, and dashed him, bruised and bleeding, one limp bundle of flesh, against the jagged and pointed summits of the submerged boulders.|$|R
40|$|Chilli-based repellents {{have shown}} promise as deterrents against crop-raiding {{elephants}} in Africa. We experimented with <b>ropes</b> <b>coated</b> with chilli-based repellent as a cheap alternative to existing elephant cropraid deterrent methods in India. Three locations (Buxa Tiger Reserve, Wyanad Wildlife Sanctuary and Hosur Forest Division) representing varying rainfall regimes from high to low, and with histories of intense elephant-agriculture conflict, {{were selected for}} the experiments that were conducted over 2 - 3 months during the pre-harvest period of the kharif season in late 2006. Chilli and tobacco powder mixed with waste oil was applied to ropes strung around agricultural fields of 1. 4 - 5. 5 km perimeter and elephant approaches were monitored. Elephants breached the rope fences a few times at all three study sites. Female-led herds were far more deterred (practically 100 % reduction) than were solitary males (c. 50 %) by the chilli-tobacco rope. Efficacy of this method as a deterrent was significantly better in the low-rainfall regime relative to medium and high-rainfall regimes. The initial promising results present a case for more rigorous experimentation; these would help determine if the elephants avoiding the rope are responding physiologically to the chilli-tobacco smell or merely reacting cautiously to a novel substance in their environment...|$|R
