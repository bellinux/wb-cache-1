5|$|The body of {{a modern}} soprano {{clarinet}} is equipped with numerous tone holes of which seven (six front, one back) are covered with the fingertips, and the rest are opened or closed using a set of keys. These tone holes let the player produce every note of the chromatic scale. On alto and larger clarinets, and a few soprano clarinets, key-covered holes replace some or all finger holes. The most <b>common</b> <b>system</b> of keys was named the Boehm system by its designer Hyacinthe Klosé in honour of flute designer Theobald Boehm, {{but it is not}} the same as the Boehm system used on flutes. The other main system of keys is called the Oehler system and is used mostly in Germany and Austria (see History). The related Albert system is used by some jazz, klezmer, and eastern European folk musicians. The Albert and Oehler systems are both based on the early Mueller system.|$|E

25|$|There have {{historically}} been five different English systems of mass: tower, apothecaries', troy, avoirdupois, and metric.

Apothecaries weight—once used by pharmacies—has been largely replaced by metric measurements. Tower weight fell out of use in England (due to legal prohibition in 1527) centuries ago, and was never used in the U.S. The imperial system, which is still used for some measures in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, is based on avoirdupois, with variations from U.S. customary units larger than a pound.|$|E

25|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} are sent on runs {{by a number}} of means. The most <b>common</b> <b>system</b> is by pager, issued to every crew. Pagers may operate on either an analog or a digital system. Analog pagers will silently listen on the air for a 5-tone signal being transmitted. Once the individual signal for that pager is detected, the pager will sound an alarm, and will often open the channel for the crew to hear the dispatcher. Further information is being given via radio. The digital pagers will listen on a different channel and once its individual address is transmitted, will prepare to receive a data package. This package normally consists of a short message, providing the address and nature of the emergency as well as additional information. This clears the radio channel of lengthy calls. Theoretically, no additional radio traffic is required when using such a system.|$|E

25|$|The European Union {{used the}} Units of Measure Directive {{to attempt to}} achieve a <b>common</b> <b>system</b> of weights and {{measures}} and to facilitate the European Single Market. Throughout the 1990s, the European Commission helped accelerate the process for member countries to complete their metric conversion processes. Among them is the United Kingdom where laws in some or all contexts mandate or permit many imperial measures, such as miles and yards for road-sign distances, road speed limits in miles per hour, pints of beer, and inches for clothes. The United Kingdom secured permanent exemptions for the mile and yard in road markings, and (with Ireland) for the pint (Imperial) of draught beer sold in pubs (see Metrication in the United Kingdom). In 2007, the European Commission also announced that (to appease British public opinion and to facilitate trade with the United States) it was to abandon the requirement for metric-only labelling on packaged goods, and to allow dual metric–imperial marking to continue indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|Most farming {{was based}} on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area. The most <b>common</b> <b>system</b> {{was based on}} infield and outfield agriculture. The infield was the best land, close to housing. It was farmed continuously and most intensively, receiving most of the manure. Crops were usually bere (a form of barley), oats and sometimes wheat, rye and legumes. The more extensive outfield was used largely for oats. It was fertilised from the overnight folding of cattle in the summer and was often left fallow to recover its fertility. In fertile regions the infield could be extensive, but in the uplands it might be small, surrounded by large amounts of outfield. In coastal areas fertiliser included seaweed and around the major burghs urban refuse was used. Yields were fairly low, often around three times the quantity of seed sown, although they could reach twice that yield on some infields.|$|E

40|$|Reichenbach {{defined a}} common cause which {{explains}} a correlation between two events if either one does not cause the other. Its intuitive {{idea is that the}} statistical ensemble can be divided into two disjoint parts so that the correlation disappears in both of the resulting subensembles if there is no causal connection between these correlated events. These subensembles can be regarded as common causes. Hofer-Szabó and Rédei (2004) generalized a Reichenbachian common cause, and called it a Reichenbachian <b>common</b> cause <b>system.</b> In the case of Reichenbachian <b>common</b> cause <b>systems</b> the statistical ensemble is divided more than two, while it is divided into two parts in the case of Reichenbachian common causes. The number of these subensembles is called the size of this system. In the present paper, we examine Reichenbachian <b>common</b> cause <b>systems</b> in general probability theories which include classical probability theories and quantum probability theories. It is shown that there is no Reichenbachian <b>common</b> cause <b>system</b> for any correlation between two events which are not logical independent, and that a general probability theory which is represented by an atomless orthomodular lattice with a faithful σ-additive probability measure contains Reichenbachian <b>common</b> cause <b>systems</b> of size 3 for any correlation between two compatible and logical independent events. Moreover, we discuss a relation between Bell's inequality and Reichenbachian <b>common</b> cause <b>systems,</b> and point out that this violation of Bell's inequality can be compatible with a Reichenbachian <b>common</b> cause <b>system</b> although it contradicts a `common' <b>common</b> cause <b>system...</b>|$|R
