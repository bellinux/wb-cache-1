Two carbohydrate polymers, <b>cationic</b> and <b>amphoteric</b> starch, were used at 0. 1 %, 0. 4 % and 0. 8 % doses for the preflocculation of talc filler under optimized conditions.

The slow-stirring method is the most widely applicable experimental method for generating log Kow/D data for all the surface-active test compounds. Generally, QSPR-predicted log Kow/D values do not correlate well with experimental values, apart for the group of non-ionic surfactants. Relatively, large differences in predicted log Kow/D values were observed when comparing various QSPR models, which were most noticeable for the ionised surfactants.|$|R

Surfactant is the base material of the car shampoo formulation. It is the chemical species that is active and has a preference for a surface or interface which is the boundary between two phases. When the surfactant is used as emulsifier, it decreases the energy {{differences between the two}} phases to allow a relative stable mixture of oil and water.

30|$|For {{deriving}} QSPR {{predictions of}} log Kow/D for surfactants, {{recommendations for the}} current most appropriate methods and approaches are provided in Table  6. There is some agreement between experimental and predicted log Kow values for non-ionics and the MAE threshold approach identifies several methods (including Broto and CLOGP) with good predictivity (Tables  5 and Additional file 4 : Table S 9). For anionics, there are fewer QSPR methods with good predictivity (including ALOGP) based on R 2 and MAE values. Cationic log Kow values were largely over-predicted, whereas amphoterics were often under-predicted by the various QSPR models used in this assessment. Whilst there are some QSPR methods available which can be applied for non-ionic and anionic surfactants, there is a dearth of methods for prediction of either <b>cationic</b> or <b>amphoteric</b> surfactants. Approaches are required to address this. These may include improvements to existing log Kow methods, development of new log Kow/D predictors or indeed development of predictors of more relevant partitioning parameters as described above.|$|R

30|$|Surfactant {{type and}} concentration: Four groups of {{surfactants}} {{based on the}} polar portion are: anionics, <b>cationics,</b> nonionics, and <b>amphoteric</b> (Lake 1989). Nonionic surfactants {{do not have any}} charge. A positively charged rock will strongly attract an anionic surfactant, and a negatively charged rock will strongly attract a cationic surfactant. Amphoterics surfactants exhibit properties of two or more groups of other surfactant groups and have not been used in chemical EOR. As a result, applying a suitable surfactant completely depends on the rock mineralogy under the reservoir condition. Cationic surfactants, for example, have not been widely used in the reservoirs including high amount of clay because they are easily adsorbed by negatively charged surface of interstitial clays. Among these types, anionic surfactants are widely used in EOR due to their lower adsorption on reservoir rocks as compared to other types of surfactants. It should be noted that some factors such as surface charge, brine salinity, and crude oil components are important to choose a suitable surfactant in different reservoirs.|$|R

40|$|Paper {{materials}} are cost effective and light weighted, {{they can easily}} be recycled and their use {{as an alternative to}} plastics is advantageous from an environmental and sustainability perspective. However, competing with plastics for packaging applications is a challenge for cellulosic products. The material needs to be strong and stiff also when exposed to liquids or moisture during transportation and storage. To achieve this for paper materials, which are intrinsically hydrophilic {{due to the nature of}} the cellulose, they need to be hydrophobized. Packaging paper {{materials are}} often made from recycled fibers. The constitution of the paper matrix can therefore vary a lot and the addition of hydrophobic compounds to the pulp in the paper production process is difficult to optimize. Therefore the recent development in paper hydrophobization has been towards Surface modification, so-called surface sizing. There is a plethora of surface sizing Products and these products are very efficient in making the paper surface more water resistant, but there is a lack of fundamental knowledge on how they work. The aim of this licentiate project, which can be regarded as the first part of a doctoral thesis work, is to explore and identify which physicochemical properties of the formulation used for surface sizing are governing the efficiency. In surface sizing the particle suspension is first mixed with starch in solution. Starchparticles and starch is the subject of one study described in this thesis. In this study the interactions between starch and three types of particles, differing in the type of stabilizer used, are explored. The different stabilizers rendered the particles <b>cationic,</b> anionic or <b>amphoteric.</b> It was found that the cationic particles formed aggregates with the starch and that it is mainly the high molecular weight, highly branched amylopectin fraction of the starch that participates in the aggregation.

The relaxation kinetics is found to be molecular weight dependent while the equilibrated state is not, leading to a proposed aggregation mechanism based on patchwise flocculation.

40|$|Hoar and Schulman {{were the}} first (in 1943) to {{describe}} the transparent water-in-oil dispersion. They noted that a certain combination of water, oil, surfactant and alcohol cosurfactant would produce a clear homogeneous "solution", which Schulman in 1959 termed microemulsion. Schulman’s model of the inverse submicroscopic micelle is shown in Fig. 1. The IUPAC definitiondescribes microemulsion as a dispersion made of water, oil, and surfactant(s), which is an isotropic and thermodynamically stable system with dispersed domain diameter varying approximately from 1 to 100 nm, usually 10 to 50 nm. Water-in-oil microemulsions are important for the synthesis of various inorganic materials. In contrast to inverse micelle, water-in-oil micro-emulsion aggregates have mobile or free water {{in the core of}} the aggregate (Fig. 2). Reactions take place in a small volume of water inside a microdroplet, which results in improved properties of the products in terms of purity and particle size distribution. Microdroplet size can be controlled by suitable choice and mixing ratio of surfactant and cosurfactant (Fig. 3) and by the chemical composition of the oil and water phases. Microemulsions may have complex phase behaviour, commonly displayed in a phase diagram (Fig. 5 and Fig. 12). Surfactants are amphiphile molecules with hydrophilic head and lypophilic tail, thus bringing them affinity both to water and oil. Their main characteristics are adsorption at the interface and self-organization into supramolecular structures. By forming the interface layer, surfactants decrease surface tension and stabilize the microemulsion. According to the character of the hydrophilic head, surfactants are divided into anionic, <b>cationic,</b> nonionic, and <b>amphoteric.</b> Chemical structures of typical representatives are given in Fig. 6. Microemulsion aggregates may have various shapes, e. g. spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical, worm-like or bilayer (Fig. 7). Bicontinuous phase also occurs in different forms, e. g. hexagonal, lamellar or cubic. The main parameters that determines the microstructure are curvature of the interface film. (Fig. 8) and critical packing parameter (Fig. 10). A microemulsion can be composed of microdroplets of oil in water, or microdroplets of water in oil, or it can be the so-called bicontinuous phase in which water and oil are continuously intermixed in a sponge-like structure (Fig. 9). The solubility of water in microemulsion (Fig. 12) as well as morphology of microemulsion aggregates (Fig. 7) are very important for the synthesis of nano particles using microemulsion technique...|$|R
