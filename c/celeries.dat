50|$|Until {{the middle}} of the last century, the economy of the town was mainly based on trade, in {{particular}} of livestock and agricultural products. The Fairs, whose tradition dates back to 1588, were very famous and attracted buyers from all over the Irpinia and the nearby Puglia. A strong support to economy was also represented by handicraft and agriculture, with large-scale production of vegetables, including <b>celeries.</b>|$|E
50|$|The baked clams {{are famous}} among Shanghai-style western dishes. The dish {{was invented by}} the Maison Pourcel chef Yu Yongli from the French {{specialty}} escargots (snails au gratin). The invention {{was caused by the}} supply shortage of French snails since 1946. After times of trials, clams were chosen by Maison Pourcel to replace snails. To make baked clams, the clam is removed from its shell and washed clean, then it is placed back into the shell with salad oil, red wine, mashed garlic, minced <b>celeries</b> etc., and baked in the oven. The new dish was so loved by the customers that it was called a Chinese-born French cuisine by the French president Georges Pompidou when he tasted it during his visit in Shanghai.|$|E

40|$|IgE {{mediated}} {{reactions to}} <b>celery</b> {{are common in}} food allergic adults in Europe. Sensitization to <b>celery</b> is frequently associated with birch and/or mugwort pollinosis, hence the term "birch- mugwort- celery-syndrome " has been established. There is evidence that birch pollen and <b>celery</b> allergy are highly related in Central Europe, while <b>celery</b> allergy is most frequently related to mugwort pollen in Southern Europe. Moreover, allergies to carrot and spices, predominantly of the umbelliferous family, are highly associated to <b>celery</b> allergy. <b>Celery</b> can induce allergic reactions of immediate type from oral contact urticaria to anaphylactic shock. About 30 % of patients with oral allergy syndrome are allergic to <b>celery.</b> Diagnostic tests like skin tests with raw <b>celery</b> and active allergen extracts have high positive predictive values, while the negative predictive values are low. Roots, also called tuber or celeriac, and sticks from the <b>celery</b> plant are used in nutrition and diagnostic procedures. Usually the frequency of sensitization to <b>celery</b> tuber is higher than to <b>celery</b> stick in <b>celery</b> allergic subjects. <b>Celery</b> tuber and stick are consumed as a raw or cooked vegetable and as a spice which is a common hidden allergen in various processed foods. Despite its high allergenic potency and at least partial thermostability <b>celery</b> and <b>celery</b> products are currently not included in mandatory labelling regulations for food allergens...|$|R

40|$|Background. A {{constantly}} growing part {{of consumers}} considers the organic foods healthier than the conventional foods. However, so far few nutritional intervention studies in humans {{are available on}} the comparison of organic and conventional food products. Objective: the aim of the present work was to compare the total antioxidant activity of organic versus conventional fruits (apples, pears, red oranges, lemons, strawberries and bananas), vegetables (lettuces, tomatoes, onions, garlics, carrots, beans, potatoes, <b>celeries,</b> peas, courgettes and zucchinies), red wine and milk. Design: The oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) procedure was used to determine both the antioxidant activity of food from organic or conventional origin, and the human plasma antioxidant capacity. Ten Caucasian Italian men, aged 30 - 65 years, were recruited. The subjects were healthy, according to the clinical examination and the disease history, none smoked or took any drug. Anthropometric parameters of all the participants were measured. Results: The ORAC values of most part of organic foods, i. e. fruits, vegetables as well as red wine and milk were significantly (p < 0. 005) higher than those of the conventional homologues. Three organic foods, i. e. pears (- 25 %) (p < 0. 01), lettuces (- 20 %) (p < 0. 01), and tomatoes salsas (- 4 %) showed ORAC values lower than the conventional homologues. After the consumption of 14 days Mediterranean organic diet a significant (p < 0. 005) increase (21 %) of the human plasma total antioxidant capacity was observed. Conclusions: Our results clearly show that the organic food products have an higher total antioxidant activity and bioactivity than the conventional foods. The results could be used in public health campaign to increase the consumption of products able to provide a significant health protection and prevention of chronic diseases...|$|E
40|$|As {{a crucial}} {{step in the}} N-cycle, {{denitrification}} not only provides an important pathway for nitrogen losses from cultivated land, but also helps to prevent excess of nitrate (and nitrite) reaching groundwater. Furthermore, denitrification is often {{considered to be a}} major source of N(2) O, which contributes-to global warm and the destruction of stratospheric ozone. Denitrification potential and nitrification potential of soils at different depths beneath four plots, including three differently fertilized plots cultivating <b>celeries</b> and one uncultivated plot (control plot) in Dayu, Kunming City, were studied in the laboratory, and N(2) O emissions from each plot were in-situ monitored, in our study. The application of fertilizers is the dominant factor controlling nitrification potential of soils at a depth of 30 cm below soil surface, which resulted in the highest nitrification potential of the soils of the plot applied by the largest amount of fertilizers. O(2) available and the soil moisture content are the important limiting factors for nitrification of soils in. the profiles. However, not fertilizer application, but the soil moisture content is the dominant factor controlling denitrification rate in soils at a depth of 30 cm below soil surface. Denitrification potential decreased in the soils at depths between 30 and 100 cm below soil surface and increased at depths greater than 100 cm below soil surface with an increase of the soil depth. This decrease is affected by a decrease {{in the size of the}} denitrification community with depth rather than solely a limitation of substrate. The increase Was probably caused by groundwater, which would favor the propagation of the denitrification community. Chemical fertilizer application also stimulated N(2) O emission. In addition to N(2) O, N(2) was produced by denitrification...|$|E

40|$|An {{anthracnose}} {{disease of}} <b>celery,</b> caused by Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato, {{has been reported}} in the U. S. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted on a collection of isolates from <b>celery</b> and non-celery hosts to evaluate their taxonomic position within Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato. Both <b>celery</b> and non-celery isolates were evaluated for pathogenicity on <b>celery</b> and for vegetative compatibility. Culture filtrates from <b>celery</b> and non-celery isolates were evaluated for their ability to reproduce the unusual leaf curl type symptoms. A total of 18 <b>celery</b> isolates were evaluated for their taxonomic placement based on analysis of the glutamine synthetase intron sequence. All isolates were closely related and belonged to the newly described species Colletotrichum fioriniae. A total of 57 isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato and C. fioriniae, representing four previously defined genetic clades, were found to have a wide virulence spectrum on <b>celery.</b> All isolates originating from <b>celery</b> caused disease on <b>celery</b> whereas a wide range in virulence on <b>celery</b> was observed among the non-celery isolates. The 18 <b>celery</b> isolates grouped into six vegetative compatibility groups indicating the population was not clonal. Elevated temperatures greatly increased leaf curl symptoms in greenhouse tests. The degree of crown rot severity and the number of petiole lesions per plant were correlated with the percent of leaf curl symptoms. Although there were inconsistencies in the experiments to determine if culture filtrates can cause leave curl symptoms, some evidence indicates that certain isolates produce a metabolite that mimics the leaf curl symptoms of the disease. The filtrate may contain indole acetic acid (IAA), and purified IAA can also cause leaf curl symptoms on <b>celery...</b>|$|R
