25|$|In {{integrated}} circuit design, physical design {{is a step}} in the standard design cycle which follows after the circuit design. At this step, circuit representations of the components (devices and interconnects) of the design are converted into geometric representations of shapes which, when manufactured in the corresponding layers of materials, will ensure the required functioning of the components. This geometric representation is called integrated <b>circuit</b> <b>layout.</b> This step is usually split into several sub-steps, which include both design and verification and validation of the layout.|$|E
25|$|In {{semiconductor}} photolithography applications, {{depth of}} field is extremely important as integrated <b>circuit</b> <b>layout</b> features must be printed with high accuracy at extremely small size. The difficulty is that the wafer surface is not perfectly flat, but may vary by several micrometres. Even this small variation causes some distortion in the projected image, and results in unwanted variations in the resulting pattern. Thus photolithography engineers take extreme measures to maximize the optical {{depth of field}} of the photolithography equipment. To minimize this distortion further, semiconductor manufacturers may use chemical mechanical polishing to make the wafer surface even flatter before lithographic patterning.|$|E

25|$|Open-source {{hardware}} (OSH) {{consists of}} physical artifacts of technology designed and {{offered by the}} open design movement. Both free and open-source software (FOSS) and open-source hardware are created by this open-source culture movement and apply a like concept {{to a variety of}} components. It is sometimes, thus, referred to as FOSH (free and open-source hardware). The term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it – coupling it closely to the maker movement. Hardware design (i.e. mechanical drawings, schematics, bills of material, PCB layout data, HDL source code and integrated <b>circuit</b> <b>layout</b> data), in addition to the software that drives the hardware, are all released under free/libre terms. The original sharer gains feedback and potentially improvements on the design from the FOSH community.

40|$|For online {{open circuit}} fault {{diagnosis}} of the traction converter in rail transit vehicles, conventional approaches depend heavily on component parameters and <b>circuit</b> <b>layouts.</b> For better universality and less parameter sensitivity during the diagnosis, this paper proposes a novel topology analysis approach to diagnose switching device open circuit failures. During the diagnosis, the topology is analyzed with fault reasoning mechanism, {{which is based on}} object-oriented Petri net (OOCPN). The OOCPN model takes in digitalized current inputs as fault signatures, and dynamical transitions between discrete switching states of a circuit with broken device are symbolized with the dynamical transitions of colored tokens in OOCPN. Such transitions simulate natural reasoning process of an expert’s brain during diagnosis. The dependence on component parameters and on <b>circuit</b> <b>layouts</b> is finally eliminated by such circuit topology reasoning process. In the last part, the proposed online reasoning and diagnosis process is exemplified with the case of a certain switching device failure in the power circuit of traction converter...|$|R
