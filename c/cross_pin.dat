Those with a complication were more frequently male [OR 3.3 (1.3, 8.6)] and had been <b>cross</b> <b>pinned</b> [OR 2.6 (1.1, 6.0)].

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{areas where}} {{intraoperative}} radiography facilities are not available, open reduction is an acceptable treatment option for fracture treatment. The {{aim of this}} investigation was to compare the outcomes of closed reduction to open reduction with cross-pinning fixation in Gartland Type III supracondylar humeral fracture extensions. METHODS: In this retrospective study, closed reduction with <b>cross</b> <b>pinning</b> fixation was performed in 7 patients with closed fractures, and open reduction with <b>cross</b> <b>pinning</b> fixation was performed in 7 patients with open fractures. RESULT: There {{was no significant difference between}} closed and open reduction with <b>cross</b> <b>pinning</b> fixation in Gartland Type III supracondylar humeral fracture extensions in terms of postoperative carrying angle and join range of motion. (p> 0. 05). There were no wound related complications in either group. CONCLUSION: Open reduction with <b>cross</b> <b>pinning</b> fixation is a viable treatment option for Gartland type III supracondylar humeral fracture extensions especially when there are no intra-operative radiography facilities (p> 0. 05) ...|$|R
30|$|Although {{the time}} to surgery {{did not have an}} effect on the {{complication}} rate, we did note an increased rate of complications due to pin configuration. In our study, <b>cross</b> <b>pinning</b> led to an 8 -fold increase in iatrogenic nerve injury. Historically, the pin configuration of pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures has been a popular debate. The majority of the literature has shown an increased risk of iatrogenic nerve injury when <b>cross</b> <b>pinning</b> is performed, although some studies disagree [3, 12, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Our results indicate that lateral pinning is a much safer procedure than <b>cross</b> <b>pinning</b> in terms of complications (5.8 vs. 14.3  %), which has been supported in the literature.|$|R

30|$|Study of a biplanar <b>crossed</b> <b>pin</b> {{construct}} by two crossed Kirschner wires in {{the management}} of displaced extension type supracondylar humeral fractures in children.|$|R
30|$|The {{standard}} <b>crossed</b> <b>pin</b> construct describes {{that each}} Kirschner wire should proceed from the epicondyles and cross proximal to the fracture site. This {{happens in the}} coronal plane alone {{but not in the}} sagittal plane, unless special attention is paid. We emphasize the technique of a biplanar <b>crossed</b> <b>pin</b> construct in which the medial and lateral Kirschner wires would achieve a crossed construct in the coronal as well as sagittal planes, providing adequate fracture stability. Though a biomechanical study of our pinning construct was not performed, a literature review mentions that <b>crossed</b> <b>pinning</b> of pediatric supracondylar fractures remains the most stable configuration [11, 23]. We believe that this could be extrapolated to assume that, when the wires cross in both the coronal and sagittal planes, the achieved construct would be more stable than in a uniplanar mode.|$|R
30|$|A biplanar <b>crossed</b> <b>pin</b> {{construct}} {{achieved by}} two Kirschner wires crossed in the coronal and sagittal planes is efficient to stabilize a displaced extension type supracondylar fracture of the humerus in children.|$|R

A punch is provided to remove the standard trigger housing pin {{and replace it with}} the longer <b>cross</b> <b>pin</b> needed to mount the medium or large backstrap that will increase the trigger distance by 2 mm or 4 mm. With the medium backstrap installed, the grip size is identical to the third-generation pistols. The magazine release catches are enlarged and reversible for left-handed use. To use the exchangeable magazine release feature, fourth-generation Glock magazines have a notch cut {{on both sides of the}} magazine body.

50|$|Ergonomics {{and fully}} ambidextrous {{controls}} were a key {{focus in the}} design of the firearm, and as a result, three interchangeable grip backstraps are included (small, medium and large) to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearm. The injection molded grip frame contains four steel guide rails for the slide: two at the rear of the frame, and the remaining pair above the front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and textured. The polymer grip has a texturized 'HI-GRIP' non-slip surface on the sides and both the front and rear backstraps and a slightly funneled magazine well to aid magazine insertion. The hollow <b>cross</b> <b>pin</b> that secures the lower end of the backstrap was designed to function as a loophole for attachment of a lanyard. Under the dust cover the grip frame has an integrated mounting MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail for attaching accessories, such as a tactical light or laser pointer.|$|E
5000|$|The K100 uses a rare locking system, {{similar in}} some ways to the Beretta Cougar, Px4 Storm, and Brügger & Thomet MP9 which employs a {{rotating}} barrel lock, which in the K100's case is cammed by a <b>cross</b> <b>pin.</b> When the pistol is fired the barrel and slide move backward together for about 3/8 of an inch while the barrel is cammed clockwise (with respect to the shooter) by a flat, twisting, helical [...] "cut" [...] in the barrel extension. Once the barrel and slide have moved back {{to the point where the}} barrel has twisted about 45°, the slide is free to continue traveling back while the barrel's travel is arrested by its interface to the frame via the barrel extension's square shoulders. On the K100, the Beretta's barrel extension cam cut, and transfer block's cam tooth, are replaced by a curled, twisting cut in the barrel extension, and a round, frame-embedded cross-pin respectively. As such, there is no transfer block (locking block) per se, and the barrel extension directly interfaces with the frame via the replaceable cross-pin. The design allows a low bore axis relative to the shooter's hand and avoids the use of the transfer/locking block typically found in rotating barrel pistols.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{outcomes}} of lateral <b>pinning</b> versus <b>cross</b> <b>pinning</b> in pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures. Data Sources: The Cochrane library, MEDLINE, CINAHL, specific orthopaedic journals, abstracts/papers from conferences and meetings, and reference lists of articles were searched from inception to September 2007. Study Selection: All randomized controlled trials and cohort studies comparing outcomes (ie, loss of fixation, iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury, and Flynn criteria) between <b>crossed</b> and lateral <b>pinning</b> were identified. Data Extraction: Two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data by using a standardized data extraction form. Data Synthesis: Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the Q test. Pooled relative risk was estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Eighteen of 1829 studies were included with 1615 supracondylar fractures (837 and 778 children with <b>cross</b> and lateral <b>pinning,</b> respectively). The average age was 6. 1 ± 0. 9 years. The risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury was 4. 3 (95 % confidence interval, 2. 1 – 9. 1) times higher in <b>cross</b> <b>pinning</b> compared with lateral pinning. There was no significant difference for loss of fixation, late deformity, or Flynn criteria between the two types of pinning. Conclusions: Lateral pinning is preferable to <b>cross</b> <b>pinning</b> for fixation of pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures as a result of decreased risk of ulnar nerve injury...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} short term {{clinical}} results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with autologous hamstring tendon between Rigid-fix and PINN-ACL <b>Cross</b> <b>Pin</b> for femoral side fixation. Materials and Methods: 127 patients who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using autologous hamstring tendon and had been followedup for over than one year were enrolled for the present study. Rigid-fix was used in 71 cases (group 1), and PINN-ACL <b>Cross</b> <b>Pin</b> was used in 56 cases (group 2). Clinical and radiological results, operation time, and perioperative complications were compared amongst the two groups. Results: The International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score and Lysholm score were 94 and 95 in group 1 and 87 and 91 in group 2, with no statistical difference (p= 0. 892, p= 0. 833), respectively. However, significant difference was observed in one-leg hop test {{between the two groups}} (p= 0. 032). Five cases in group 1 and 40 cases in group 2 were found to be associated with perioperative complications with statistical difference (p< 0. 0001). Conclusions: There was no resultant difference between the employment of PINN-ACL <b>Cross</b> <b>Pin</b> and Rigid-fix as femoral graft fixation for ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon. However, PINN-ACL <b>Cross</b> <b>Pin</b> led to complications with extensive operation times. Hence, it needs further improvement of tools for minimization of complications.

30|$|Fixation may be {{provided}} {{by a variety of}} devices or <b>crossed</b> <b>pins</b> [12]. In our experience plate osteosynthesis for femoral fixation and staples osteosynthesis for tibial fixation provided good results without complications.

30|$|The {{osteotomy}} {{to correct}} this torsion and remove the excessive strain on the knee can be fixed {{by a variety of}} methods including casting [1, 9, 12], <b>crossed</b> <b>pins</b> [4, 6, 13] and plates [4, 5, 14]. Casting offers the advantage of no hardware, but potential loss of fixation. <b>Crossed</b> <b>pins</b> that offer the advantage of simple fixation, but require cast protection, are temporary and must be removed early due to potential complications from the <b>pin</b> <b>crossing</b> the skin. Plates offer the advantage of fixation beneath the skin, but the rigid fixation may cause delayed healing of the bone and may not permit early weightbearing. The use of intramedullary rods for fixation of the tibia is attractive since it allows for fixation within the bone—sharing the load of walking with the bone and therefore promoting healing, minimizing soft tissue dissection, avoiding the need for supplemental fixation such as a cast and facilitating early weightbearing. A similar approach of intramedullary fixation has been previously reported for isolated femoral osteotomy in pediatric patients [8].|$|R
30|$|Although many use <b>crossed</b> <b>pin</b> fixation, {{controversy}} persists {{regarding the}} number of Kirschner wires {{to be used for}} fixation. A greater number of wires inserted in each of the epicondyles may offer more stability, but multiple entry points over a small cartilaginous area would increase the chances of skin nipping, nerve entrapment, and pin-tract infections.|$|R

30|$|Supracondylar humerus {{fractures}} {{are common}} in children. Displaced fractures are usually treated with closed reduction and <b>cross</b> <b>pin</b> fixation.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the parents-based cosmetic satisfaction of the incision scars in children with displaced supracondylar humerus fractures treated by closed reduction and <b>cross</b> <b>pin</b> fixation with or without small medial incision. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 72 children with displaced supracondylar humerus fractures treated two different closed reduction and percutaneous pinning methods at our institution from January 2010 through December 2013. A group has 36 patients treated with small medial incision and crossed K-wires fixation after closed reduction. The other group has 36 patients treated with closed reduction and K-wires fixation. At the final follow-up, the patients were evaluated radiologically and clinically with Flynn’s criteria. Furthermore, a visual analogue scale was used to determine of the parents-based cosmetic satisfaction score. All fractures healed without major complications at the final clinical and radiological assessment. Although, between the two groups did not differ in terms of Flynn cosmetic and functional outcomes, there were statistically significant differences between both groups according to the parents-based cosmetic satisfaction scores. The closed reduction and crossed pin fixation without small medial incision should be preferred first because of better the parents-based cosmetic satisfaction.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{commonly}} accepted {{treatment of}} displaced supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children is fracture reduction and percutaneous pin fixation; however, there is controversy about the optimal {{placement of the}} pins. A crossed-pin configuration {{is believed to be}} mechanically more stable than lateral pins alone; however, the ulnar nerve can be injured {{with the use of a}} medial pin. It has not been proved that the added stability of a medial pin is clinically necessary since, in young children, pin fixation is always augmented with immobilization in a splint or cast. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the results of reduction and Kirschner wire fixation of 345 extension-type supracondylar fractures in children. Maintenance of fracture reduction and evidence of ulnar nerve injury were evaluated in relation to pin configuration and fracture pattern. Of 141 children who had a Gartland type- 2 fracture (a partially intact posterior cortex), seventy-four were treated with lateral pins only and sixty-seven were treated with <b>crossed</b> <b>pins.</b> Of 204 children who had a Gartland type- 3 (unstable) fracture, fifty-one were treated with lat-eral pins only and 153 were treated with <b>crossed</b> <b>pins.</b> Results: There was no difference with regard to maintenance of fracture reduction, as seen on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs, between the <b>crossed</b> <b>pins</b> and the lateral pins. The configuration of the pins did not affect the maintenance of reduction of either the Gartland type- 2 fractures or the Gartland type- 3 fractures. Ulna...|$|R
30|$|We {{found no}} {{significant}} correlation between the time to surgery and complications, operative time, or need for open reduction. These findings support the trend of treating Gartland type III supracondylar humerus fractures in a less urgent manner. In addition, our study supports the concept that <b>cross</b> <b>pinning</b> leads to more complications than lateral pinning, including an 8 -fold increase in iatrogenic nerve injury.|$|R
30|$|Bioabsorbable {{implants}} {{are commonly}} used for orthopaedic intra-articular procedures. They have a theoretical advantage over metal analogues in their secure initial fixation and subsequent degradation with eventual replacement by host tissues [1]. The RIGIDFIX anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) <b>cross</b> <b>pin</b> (Mitek, Westwood, MA, USA) utilises polylactic (PLA) pins to give the advantage of 360 ° bone-to-graft contact at the graft tunnel, with clinically acceptable pull-out strength and proven patient outcomes [2, 3]. This fixation method does, however, have the disadvantages of local tissue response, such as inflammation and swelling [4, 5]. We report the case of implant migration and the loose body presenting as a subcutaneous collection.|$|E
30|$|The gold {{standard}} treatment of displaced supracondylar humerus fractures in children is the closed reduction and pin fixation (Pretell-Mazzini et al. 2011; Belhan et al. 2009; Sibinski et al. 2006; Kalenderer et al. 2008; Bashyal et al. 2009; Kaewpornsawan 2001). <b>Cross</b> <b>pin</b> fixation is more stable mechanically {{than any other}} type of pin configuration (Zionts et al. 1994; Lee et al. 2002). However, this fixation technique may cause iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury during the medial pinning. The probability of ulnar nerve injury in the fixation with crossed pins is higher than the fixation with only lateral entry pins (Brauer et al. 2007; Slobogean et al. 2010).|$|E

30|$|The loss of {{reduction}} is rarely encountered after <b>crossed</b> <b>pins</b> fixation and it usually occurs due to technical errors (Brauer et al. 2007; Omid et al. 2008).

Another weak point was that the surgical techniques were selected by surgeons.|$|R

30|$|In summary, {{treating}} Gartland type III supracondylar humerus {{fractures in}} a non-urgent fashion {{did not increase}} the risk of complications or conversion to open reduction in our study population.
