Potential-dependent in situ InfraRed Reflection Absorption spectra obtained below the onset of cyanate oxidation were compared with previously published data and analyzed {{on the basis of}} periodical Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The calculated adsorption energies for cyanate and related species suggest that <b>cyanic</b> and isocyanic <b>acid</b> adsorb weakly at the studied gold surfaces and, thus, seems not to be at the origin of any of the adsorbate bands in the experimental infrared spectra collected in the cyanate-containing solutions. The latter features can be clearly ascribed to the asymmetric OCN stretching of N-bonded cyanate species. The observation of absorption bands in a wide spectral region, including features above 2200 cm− 1, agrees with the coexistence of N-bonded cyanate species with different adsorption sites and tilting angles. DFT calculations have revealed that although these adspecies can have significantly different frequencies, their adsorption energies are rather close. In addition, the existence of collective in-phase vibrations at relatively high cyanate coverages also contributes to the widening of the absorption bands.

40|$|Density {{functional}} theory (DFT) {{calculations of}} cyanate (OCN(-)) charge-transfer complexes {{were performed to}} model the "XCN" feature observed in interstellar icy grain mantles. OCN(-) charge-transfer complexes were formed from precursor combinations of HNCO or HOCN with either NH 3 or H 2 O. Three different solvation strategies for realistically modeling the ice matrix environment were explored, including (1) continuum solvation, (2) pure DFT cluster calculations, and (3) an ONIOM DFT/PM 3 cluster calculation. The model complexes were evaluated by their ability to reproduce seven spectroscopic measurements associated with XCN: the band origin of the OCN(-) asymmetric stretching mode, shifts in that frequency due to isotopic substitutions of C, N, O, and H, plus two weak features. The continuum solvent field method produced results consistent {{with some of the}} experimental data but failed to account for other behavior due to its limited capacity to describe molecular interactions with solvent. DFT cluster calculations successfully reproduced the available spectroscopic measurements very well. In particular, the deuterium shift showed excellent agreement in complexes where OCN(-) was fully solvated. Detailed studies of representative complexes including from two to twelve water molecules allowed the exploration of various possible solvation structures and provided insights into solvation trends. Moreover, complexes arising from <b>cyanic</b> or isocyanic <b>acid</b> in pure water suggested an alternative mechanism for the formation of OCN(-) charge-transfer complexes without the need for a strong base such as NH 3 to be present.

40|$|Symposium F, session 32, paper number F 32 - 0006 - 10 (Oral) International audienceIn this contribution, {{starting}} from {{a set of}} molecules {{that could have been}} available on the early earth, we will present a chemical reactor capable of promoting amino acid activation and condensation, for their elongation into oligopeptides allowing the accumulation of peptide chains in environments considered as prebiotic. Organic matter available on the early Earth may have two origins. The first reservoir of material derived from exogenous inputs that correspond to organic compounds brought to the Earth via comets or (micro-) meteorites. A second pool of organic matter was available from the atmosphere of the primitive Earth, in which photochemistry or processes induced by lightning can have led to low-molecular weight chemical intermediates of interest for the development of further prebiotic chemistry under favorable conditions. This kind of chemistry may have been present at certain stages of the evolution of the surface (atmosphere/ocean) of the Earth, some 3. 5 to 4 billion years ago. One of our aims is to identify new chemical pathways allowing the formation of oligopeptides under prebiotic conditions {{starting from}} these two reservoirs of organic matter. Our initial studies have identified several possible pathways leading to peptide formations either under oxidizing conditions (with assistance of oxides of nitrogen) or under reductive ones, with <b>cyanic</b> <b>acid</b> and cyanate (or its precursor urea) and amino acids as only required starting materials. Through these reactions, amino acids are activated and condensed into oligopeptides which once formed, elongate from their N-terminal residue. We have subsequently shown that under certain conditions the amino terminus can react with <b>cyanic</b> <b>acid</b> which limits peptide elongation to short peptide chains. To overcome these limitations to peptide elongations, reagents could be available within the above mentioned reservoirs to enable elongation no longer at the N-terminal residues, but at C-terminal residues through a C-terminal activation...|$|E
