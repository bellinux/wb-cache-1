In comparison with the other commercial preparations, commercial rennets had the highest variability in chemical composition and their polypeptide profiles showed numerous protein bands ranging from 15 kDa to 197 kDa, like artisanal rennets. Protein composition of commercial rennets revealed the presence of bovine serum albumin, either native or degraded, and degraded chymosin. The results indicated that the source of coagulating enzymes and the conditions applied for enzyme extraction led to specific chemical compositions, polypeptide patterns and protein composition which are described in this article.

40|$|The {{first step}} in cheese {{manufacture}} is {{the formation of a}} gel from milk. This step can be achieved by adding milk-clotting preparations prepared from various sources and different methods. Each preparation contains not only coagulating enzyme(s) but also an associated support. Our objective was to characterize this support and to identify differences between preparations according to their manufacturing process and sources. Twenty-four preparations representative of the diversity available for cheese manufacture were sampled 3 times over a period of 6 months: 10 commercial <b>rennets,</b> 9 artisanally-produced <b>calf</b> <b>rennets,</b> 2 recombinant chymosins and 3 microbial preparations. Preparations were analysed for sodium, chloride, phosphorus, ammonia, free amino groups and ash contents, pH value and the phosphotungstic-acid-soluble nitrogen fraction. The protein diversity was determined by SDS−polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and particular bands identified by reversed-phase nano liquid chromatography coupled on line to tandem mass spectrometry. The preparations were clearly discriminated according to the composition of their support. Preparations from Cryphonectria parasitica had the highest content in ammonia and nitrogen fractions. Commercial rennets and preparations from Rhizomucor miehei had the highest values for mineral composition while traditional rennets had the lowest. Commercial rennets presented the highest variability in composition. This variability was also confirmed by electrophoresis performed at the same milk-clotting activity, in which numerous protein bands ranging from 10 kDa to 150 kDa were shown in contrast to other preparations. Among the identified proteins, bovine serum albumin was mainly present in commercial rennets as well as minor bovine proteins and as expected not in recombinant chymosins. The observed variability in the support between the investigated preparations was linked to the source of coagulating enzymes and within the same source was inherent to the method used to obtain preparations. Work is under progress to determine if support impacts the cheesemanufacturing process...|$|R

30|$|Milk {{coagulation}} {{is a basic}} step in cheese manufacturing. For a {{long time}} <b>calf</b> <b>rennet,</b> the conventional milk clotting enzyme obtained from the fourth stomach of suckling calves (Nagodawithana &Reed 1993), is {{the most widely used}} coagulant in cheese-making {{all over the world to}} manufacture most of the cheese varieties. The worldwide reduced supply of <b>calf</b> <b>rennet</b> and the ever increase of cheese production and consumption have stimulated the research for milk clotting enzyme (MCE) from alternative sources to be used as <b>calf</b> <b>rennet</b> substitutes (Areces et al. 1992; Escobar &Barnett 1993; Lopes et al. 1998; Nouani et al. 2011). Various animals, plants and microbial proteases have been suggested as milk coagulants (Chazarra et al. 2007; D’Ambrosio et al. 2003; Silva &Malcata 2005; Zhang et al. 2011).

40|$|Extracts of milk coagulating enzymes were obtained, {{adult bovine}} from the abomasums of pasture fed cattle and lamb rennet from the abomasums of {{partially}} milk fed lambs slaughtered {{between three and}} six months of age. Both rennets were, {{in the presence of}} sodium chloride, most stable at 10 °C or lower at pH 4. 7 for adult bovine and pH 4. 1 for lamb. Heat treatment in a sodium chlorine solution (200 mg/ml) at 68 °C for 60 minutes destroyed less than 35 % of the activity of each rennet. Under the same conditions <b>calf</b> <b>rennet</b> was completely inactivated. The cheesemaking properties of adult bovine and lamb rennets were compared with <b>calf</b> <b>rennet.</b> Adult bovine and calf rennets responded similarly to changes of pH however lamb rennet appeared less active than <b>calf</b> <b>rennet</b> at higher pH's when measured in caseinate solution but appeared more active than <b>calf</b> <b>rennet</b> when measured in milk by a curd tension method. The optimum temperature for milk coagulating activity was 40 °C for adult bovine and calf rennets but only 30 °C for lamb rennet when measured in caseinate solution. The curd tension of milk coagulated with the three rennets increased with time but both adult bovine and lamb rennets appeared more sensitive to milk calcium levels than <b>calf</b> <b>rennet.</b> Whole casein, αs-, β- and k-caseins were hydrolysed in a similar manner by the three rennets. Adult bovine rennet was the most proteolytic on whole and β- caseins while <b>calf</b> <b>rennet</b> hydrolysed αs- and k-caseins more rapidly than the other rennets. Two pepsins, of similar amino acid compositions, were isolated, one from adult bovine rennet and one from lamb rennet which also contained a rennin. All three enzymes were purified so that lamb rennin and pepsin each produced only a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but the adult bovine pepsin produced two bands and appeared to be heterogeneous. Cheese made with adult bovine, lamb or a 50 / 50 mixture of calf-adult bovine rennets were compared with cheese made with <b>calf</b> <b>rennet</b> and found to be similar in manufacturing characteristics, flavour and body after three and six months storage at 6 or 13 °C. Polyacrylaride gel electrophoretograms of these cheese after one to twelve months storage at 6 °C showed that the milk coagulant had no effect on the casein degradation products produced in the cheese although the rate of degradation varied slightly. Perchloric acid was found to be a good protein precipitant for quenching casein-rennet reactions and was utilize in a ethod which was developed for assaying milk coagulating activity. Rennet was added to sodium caseinate solution and one minute later the reaction quenched with perchloric acid. The quantity of peptides hydrolysed from the casein was measured at 217 nm and was directly proportional to rennet activity over a limited range of activity. A method for removing mucoproteins, the major impurity in rennet, was developed and a commercial scale plant commissioned. A diethylaminoethyl cellulose based resin, equilibrated with a citrate buffer, retained the rennet enzymes while the mucoproteins passed through uninhibited. The enzymes were eluted with the same buffer made 1. 0 M with sodium chloride.

40|$|Background. Microbial milk-clotting enzymes {{are valued}} as <b>calf</b> <b>rennet</b> {{substitutes}} in the cheese industry. The worldwide increase of cheese production {{coupled with a}} reduced supply of <b>calf</b> <b>rennet</b> has prompted a search for <b>calf</b> <b>rennet</b> substitutes, including microbial and plant rennets. However, most plant rennets have proved unsuitable because they impart a bitter taste to the cheese. Microbial rennet {{appears to be more}} promising because its production is cheaper, biochemical diversity is greater, and genetic modifi cation is easier. Most cheese manufacturing facilities in Egypt perform land spreading of salt whey. However, this practice increases the chloride levels of soil, and elevates the risk of crop damage. One possible application for salt whey is {{to use it as a}} whole medium for growth and production of milk clotting enzyme from fungi. Material and methods. Mucor pusillus QM 436 was identifi ed to produce the highest milk-clotting activity during screening of 19 fungal strains. Salted whey results from Ras (Cephalotyre) cheese manufacture as a whole medium for growth of Mucor pusillus QM 436 and production of the enzyme. Results. The milk-clotting enzyme from Mucor pusillus QM 436 was purifi ed to 7. 14 -fold with 54. 4 % recovery by precipitation in ammonium sulfate, ethanol and fractionated by gel fi ltration on Sephadex G- 100. The enzyme was active in the pH range 5. 5 - 7. 5 and was inactivated completely by heating 5 min at 70 &deg;C and 30 min at 65 &deg;C. The highest level of enzyme activity was obtained at 60 &deg;C, pH 5. 5. A positive and proportional relationship occurred in the presence of CaCl 2 in milk, with inhibition which occurred in the presence of NaCl. Conclusions. The high level of milk-clotting activity coupled with a low level of thermal stability suggested that the milk-clotting enzyme from Mucor pusillus QM 436 should be considered as a potential substitute for <b>calf</b> <b>rennet...</b>|$|E

The objective of this research was to summarize the effect of rennet type (<b>calf</b> <b>rennet</b> and microbial rennet from Rhizomucor miehei) and starter culture on the sensory properties and free amino acids (FAA) release during the ripening of Turkish White brined cheese. The concentrations of FAA and sensory properties were similar for cheeses made with both types of coagulant and starter culture. Aminoacids Phe, Leu - Ile, Gln, Val, Pro and Ala were the principal FAAs in the White brined cheeses at all stages of ripening...|$|E

In addition to softening the cheese body, proteolysis influences the development of cheese flavour via the formation of amino acid and peptides which make a direct contribution to flavour.

40|$|An {{ochratoxin}} free extracellular acid protease {{was produced}} by solid state cultivation of Aspergillus niger FFB 1. The purified enzyme (48. 7 kDa) showed an optimal milk clotting activity at pH 5. 5 and 45 °C {{in the presence of}} 0. 01 M CaCl 2. The enzyme was stable at least 24 h at 35 °C in the pH range of 5. 5 – 7. 0. Thermal denaturation started above 45 °C. Fresh cheese manufactured with reconstituted cow milk and the purified enzyme showed similar basic characteristics (pH 4. 5, acid taste, white color) as marketed cheeses obtained with <b>calf</b> <b>rennet.</b> This emphasizes the value of exploiting local biological resources for value added food processing in developing countrie...|$|E
40|$|Four zymogens of acidic proteases A, B, C, and C’ were {{isolated}} from the gastric mucosa of harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) by ion exchange chromatography on a DEAE Sephadex A- 50 column. Zymogens A and C were further purified by affinity chromatography using carbobenzoxy-D-phynylalanine-triethylene-tetramine and gel filtration on a Sephadex G- 100 column. Certain physical and catalytic properties of proteases A and C were {{compared with those of}} calf chymosin (E. C. 3. 4. 23. 4) and porcine pepsin (E. C. 3. 4. 23. 1). [...] Zymogen C and the corresponding enzyme were homogeneous on analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Zymogen A was homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate and high performance liquid chromatography but was heterogenous as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of SDS. Zymogens A and C had molecular weights of 26, 300 ± 1540 and 37, 100 ± 1075 daltons respectively as estimated by gel filtration but 33, 800 + 1800 and 44, 000 + 2100 daltons respectively as estimated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protease A had an isoelectric point of 4. 90. The energies of activation of protease A and calf chymosin were 15. 6 and 13. 1 Kcal/more calculated from the milk clotting activity of the enzymes. [...] Protease A was similar to calf chymosin with respect to several criteria. It had a higher ratio of milk clotting to proteolytic activity than those of seal protease C and porcine pepsin, clotted milk up to pH 7. 0, and had a pH optimum of 2. 2 - 3. 5 for hemoglobin hydrolysis. It did not inactivate ribonuclease, had very low activity on APDT and lost activity in 6 M urea. These results indicate that protease A is chymosin-like rather than pepsin-like. [...] Experimental Cheddar cheese made with protease A, <b>calf</b> <b>rennet,</b> crude seal gastric protease (SGP) and Fromase (Musor miehei protease) had comparable yields and proximate compositions. Sensory analysis of experimental cheeses after 30 weeks of aging showed that the product made with crude SGP had higher sensory scores than those made with the other coagulants. Chemical analyses showed more extensive degradation of protein in cheeses made with <b>calf</b> <b>rennet</b> and Fromase than in the cheeses made with the seal proteases. The electrophoretic patterns of the proteins from cheeses made with seal proteases were qualitatively similar to those of <b>calf</b> <b>rennet</b> cheese.

40|$|Protein {{recovery}} and coagulation properties of five commercial and fractionated milk clotting enzymes were studied. The fractionated enzymes were Sephadex G- 100 fractions {{of the commercial}} enzymes. Milk clotting activity of each fraction was tested using Berridge substrate. All fractions from each preparation which had milk clotting activity as measured with the Formagraph were collected and pooled. These samples and the original enzyme preparations were used to coagulate milk. Percent of protein lost in whey was determined by Kjeldahl. Coagulation was followed using a spectrophotometer monitoring changes in apparent absorbance at 600 nm. Curd protein yields using the five original enzyme preparations were compared with each other. Also, protein lost in whey from the five original preparations were compared with those using the isolated fraction. There {{was a significant difference}} among the original enzymes in protein lost in whey. There were also significant differences between some of the commercial enzyme preparations and their fractionated preparations. Gel filtration through Sephadex G- 100 improved bovine rennet and calf rennet/porcine pepsin mixture more than the other three enzyme preparations. <b>Calf</b> <b>rennet,</b> Mucor miehei protease and modified M. miehei protease showed no significant reduction in protein lost to whey after fractionation. Protein loss using original <b>calf</b> <b>rennet,</b> bovine rennet and modified M. miehei protease were not significantly different from each other. M. miehei protease and calf rennet/porcine pepsin mixture were not significantly different from each other, but, the two groups were significantly different from each other. There were noticeable differences in coagulation curves of the five original enzymes. Coagulation properties of commercial and fractionated enzyme were different in all five pairs...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{proteolytic}} activity by incubating whole ovine casein with 6 industrial (liquid and paste) and two traditional (paste) rennet preparations from calf, lamb and kid. Casein hydrolysate was analysed by pH 8. 6 urea-PAGE analysis and immunoblotting using polyclonal antibodies against αs 1 and β-casein (CN). The degradation patterns showed that αs 1 -CN was hydrolysed more quickly than β-CN giving rise to αs 1 -I casein. The highest degree of proteolysis was observed in 3 types of industrial rennet, two from lamb, either liquid or paste, and one liquid from <b>calf.</b> <b>Rennet</b> from kid (industrial or traditional/liquid or paste) showed the lowest proteolytic activity. The pepsin content was very different among the tested rennet samples, probably explaining the difference in proteolytic activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{increase in}} cheese production and consumption, {{together with the}} reduced supply and consequent price increase of <b>calf</b> <b>rennet,</b> {{has led to the}} search of new milk coagulant agents. Much research interest has been thus directed towards discovering milk clotting enzymes which would satisfactory replace <b>calf</b> <b>rennet</b> in cheese manufacture. Microbial rennet produced by genetically engineered bacteria {{has proven to be a}} suitable substitute even though the consumer constraints on the use of animal rennet either for religion reasons (Judaism and Islam) or diet habits (vegetarianism) or consumer concerns regarding genetically engineered foods (Germany, Netherlands and France forbid the use of recombinant <b>calf</b> <b>rennet)</b> have led to a growing interest toward vegetable coagulants. Therefore, several plant sources of milk-clotting enzymes have been investigated. Unfortunately, most of the "plant rennets" were found unsuitable because they produced extremely bitter dairy products due to a strong proteolysis. However, an exception to this general rule is represented by the extract of flowers of the Cynara genus. In particular, flowers of Cynara scolymus and Cynara cardunculus contain two different aspartic proteases named cynarase and cardosin, respectively. The latter enzyme was successfully used for cheese manufacture in several areas of Portugal and Spain. Regarding the cynarase, its use is limited since the flowers of globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus) represent an edible part before the blooming. In fact, in Mediterranean countries, the globe artichoke plays an important economic role, so that Italy is the first producer with ~ 475 kt. However, the artichoke processing industry generates large amounts of agricultural solid wastes of which ~ 60 % is represented by the leaves. Therefore, I found of great interest to investigate the presence of aspartic proteases, possessing milk clotting properties, in the Cynara scolymus leaves as well as in the flowers of Carduus defloratus, as unproductive and/or intensely exploited agricultural lands. The obtained results showed the presence of clotting enzyme both in the leaves of Cynara scolymus and in the flowers of Carduus defloratus. In the first case, the extraction of proteins from plant tissue resulted difficult due to the presence of interfering compounds such as cell wall cellulose, lipids and other polysaccharides. To optimize protein extraction an enzymatic pretreatment with a mixture of carbohydrases was successfully carried out. However, the yield was always very low and, therefore, this protocol would be hardly suitable for an industrial application. For these reasons, in the second part of the work, I have studied the possibility to immobilize the enzyme extracted from the flowers of Carduus defloratus by using a commercial rennet from Mucor meihei as model enzyme. The immobilization of the enzyme extracted from both sources was successfully carried out by using an epoxy support and, in particular, the results showed that the Carduus defloratus enzyme exhibited higher stability than the commercial rennet one. All these results suggest the possibility to use an immobilized "vegetable rennet", extracted from the flowers of Carduus defloratus, for the production of novel dairy products...|$|E
