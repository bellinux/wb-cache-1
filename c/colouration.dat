5|$|Murray cod {{are white}} to cream on their ventral (belly) surfaces. Their backs and flanks are usually yellowish-green to green, overlain with heavy darker green, but {{occasionally}} brown or black, mottling. The {{effect is a}} marbled appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard's markings. <b>Colouration</b> is related to water clarity; <b>colouration</b> is intense in fish from clear water habitats. Small to medium-sized Murray cod from clear-water habitats often have striking and very distinct <b>colouration.</b> Very large fish tend towards a speckled grey-green <b>colouration.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>colouration</b> of {{the males}} allows them to visibly {{stand out from the}} brown forest floor. This bright <b>colouration</b> {{provides}} a sexual advantage for the adult males, increasing their likelihood of successfully mating. The result is rapid evolutionary selection within the species for brighter plumage and more conspicuous behaviour patterns in the males. The bright <b>colouration</b> also makes the males more susceptible to predation. Males are more expendable for this reason; {{only a small number of}} males are needed within any generation in order to perpetuate the species. While sexual selection leads to bright plumage, natural selection in turn favors defensive <b>colouration</b> in the birds. There is higher fitness in birds monitoring nests whose <b>colouration</b> acts as camouflage-protection from predation.|$|E
5|$|Study of the {{structural}} <b>colouration</b> of the wing scales of swallowtail butterflies {{led to the development}} of more efficient light-emitting diodes. The structural <b>colouration</b> of butterflies is inspiring nanotechnology research to produce paints that do not use toxic pigments and in the development of new display technologies.|$|E
5|$|Atypical <b>colourations</b> in red foxes usually {{represent}} stages toward full melanism, {{and mostly}} occur in cold regions.|$|R
5|$|The {{electrostatic}} design does {{away with}} two major weaknesses of boxed speakers: enclosure <b>colourations</b> and signal degradation {{due to the}} crossover. The crossover in the ESL consists merely of resistors which work with the inherent capacitance of the speaker elements to obtain a first-order response. Because it is bipolar, {{both sides of the}} elements are not enclosed, but radiate directly into the air. Thus, <b>colourations</b> due to crossover components and box-induced reflections are minimised.|$|R
50|$|The {{same color}} may be {{referred}} to differently in different breeds. Likewise, a same term may mean different <b>colourations</b> in different breeds.|$|R
5|$|Like {{some other}} cephalopods, bigfin reef squids {{are capable of}} metachrosis – rapidly {{changing}} body <b>colouration</b> and patterns through voluntary control of chromatophores. They also possess iridophores (particularly in the head), a form of structural <b>colouration</b> that produces iridescent metallic greens and red when illuminated. They are also possibly one of two squid species with leucophores. Leucophores are a reflector-type structural <b>colouration</b> that reflects ambient light, such that they are white in white light, green in green light, and so on. Bigfin reef squids are remarkable for having the ability to produce complex body patterns {{from the moment they}} hatch. In comparison, other loliginid squid species do not produce complex body patterns at less than four months of age. The patterns produced by bigfin reef squids, however, are less diverse than those of the Caribbean reef squids.|$|E
5|$|Sinosauropteryx was {{the first}} dinosaur to have its life <b>colouration</b> {{described}} by scientists based on physical evidence. Some fossils of Sinosauropteryx show an alternation of lighter and darker bands preserved on the tail. Chen and colleagues initially interpreted this banding pattern as an artifact of the splitting between the main slab and counter-slab in which the original specimen was preserved. However, Longrich suggested in his 2002 presentation for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology that these specimens actually preserve remnants of the <b>colouration</b> pattern the animal would have exhibited in life. He argued that the dark, banded areas on the tail were too evenly spaced to {{have been caused by}} random separation of the fossil slabs, and that they represent fossilized pigments present in the feathers. Additionally, rather than an artifact of preservation or decomposition, the presence of dark feathers along only the top of the body may also reflect the colour pattern in life, indicating that Sinosauropteryx prima was countershaded with dark <b>colouration</b> on its back and lighter <b>colouration</b> on its underside, with bands or stripes on the tail for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The babblers, or timaliids, are {{somewhat}} diverse {{in size and}} <b>colouration,</b> but are characterised by soft fluffy plumage.|$|E
50|$|Research is {{currently}} being carried out {{in an attempt to}} determine if some of the different <b>colourations</b> may actually represent different species or subspecies.|$|R
50|$|Hypselodoris reidi has a cream-to-white {{body with}} white raised spots {{covering}} its dorsum. The gills and rhinophores are a pale straw-yellow colour. There are sometimes pale-purple or brown <b>colourations</b> on the body.|$|R
5000|$|Redwitzite is {{also called}} Syenite Granite and {{occurs in the}} Marktredwitz/Arzberg/Thiersheim triangle; medium- and also fine-grained, its {{variable}} mineral composition produces <b>colourations</b> from light grey, dark grey and dark green-grey to almost black.|$|R
5|$|The {{fin whale}} is usually {{distinguished}} by its tall spout, long back, prominent dorsal fin, and asymmetrical <b>colouration.</b>|$|E

5|$|The two {{existing}} specimens {{were originally}} preserved in alcohol, but though this can discolour specimens, {{it is not}} probable that it could turn green to blue. Hume and Hein van Grouw have also suggested that due to an inheritable mutation, some Newton's parakeets may have lacked psittacin, a pigment that together with eumalanin produces green <b>colouration</b> in parrot feathers. Complete lack of psittacine produces blue <b>colouration,</b> whereas reduced psittacine can produce a colour between green and blue called parblue, which corresponds to the colour of the two preserved Newton's parakeet specimens.|$|E
50|$|Haloarchaea {{are found}} mainly in hypersaline lakes and solar salterns. Their high densities {{in the water}} often lead to pink or red <b>colourations</b> of the water (the cells {{possessing}} high levels of carotenoid pigments, presumably for UV protection).|$|R
50|$|In {{other animals}} that possess UV vision such as birds, {{ultraviolet}} sensitivity can be advantageous for courtship and reproductive success. This is because some birds have feathers with certain favourable <b>colourations</b> {{that can not}} be distinguished by human vision outside of the UV spectrum.|$|R
5000|$|Spanish {{sky blue}} is the colour {{that is called}} celeste (the Spanish word for [...] "sky blue") in the Guía de coloraciones (Guide to <b>colourations)</b> by Rosa Gallego andJuan Carlos Sanz, a colour {{dictionary}} published in 2005 that is widely popular in the Hispanophone realm.|$|R
5|$|C. b. macrorhynchus, {{given the}} name great-billed {{cockatoo}} by Mathews, is found across northern Australia. Although {{thought to be}} widespread and abundant, this subspecies has been little studied. It is also large and has a large beak, as its subspecific name implies. Females lack red <b>colouration</b> in their tails.|$|E
5|$|Earlier ornithologists {{felt that}} the kakapo {{might be related to}} the ground parrots and night parrot of Australia due to their similar <b>colouration,</b> but this is contradicted by recent studies; rather, the cryptic colour seems to be {{adaptation}} to terrestrial habits that evolved twice convergently.|$|E
5|$|Nikolai Zarudny and Härms {{described}} a subspecies, rubripersonatus, from Baluchistan in 1902. This was {{described a}}s having a deeper reddish orange skin {{on the head and}} a yellow-tipped dark bill. This has rarely been considered a valid subspecies but the intermediate pattern of bill <b>colouration</b> suggests intermixing of subspecies.|$|E
50|$|S. elegans often reproduces asexually by fragmentation, {{also known}} as basal laceration. As it crawls across a rock surface, pieces of its base become {{detached}} and grow into new individuals. This gives rise to groups of sea anemones {{in close proximity to}} each other which have identical <b>colourations.</b>|$|R

50|$|Adults {{contain the}} toxic {{cantharidin}} in their corporal fluids {{as a defensive}} mechanism; several species show brilliant and metallic blue, green, gold or coppery, often combined with yellow, orange or red, aposematic <b>colourations.</b> In temperate regions, adults are mainly polyphagous pollen and nectar-feeding, and diurnal in activity. In tropical areas, most are nocturnal and are attracted to light.|$|R
5|$|Phalacrocoracidae is {{a family}} of medium to large coastal, {{fish-eating}} seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage <b>colouration</b> varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful.|$|E
5|$|Poisonous species {{often use}} bright {{colouring}} to warn potential predators of their toxicity. These warning colours {{tend to be}} red or yellow combined with black, with the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) being an example. Once a predator has sampled one of these, {{it is likely to}} remember the <b>colouration</b> next time it encounters a similar animal. In some species, such as the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.), the warning <b>colouration</b> is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked, exhibiting their bright colours to the predator. The frog Allobates zaparo is not poisonous, but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality, a strategy that may deceive predators.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gemsbok, sable antelope, and Grant's gazelle, are camouflaged with {{strongly}} disruptive facial markings that {{conceal the}} highly recognisable eye. Many species, such as gazelles, may be made to look flat, and hence to blend into the background, by countershading. The outlines of many bovids are broken up with bold disruptive <b>colouration,</b> the strongly contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators. However, all the Hippotraginae (including the gemsbok) have pale bodies and faces with conspicuous markings. The zoologist Tim Caro describes this as difficult to explain, but given that the species are diurnal, he suggests that the markings may function in communication. Strongly contrasting leg <b>colouration</b> is common only in the Bovidae, where for example Bos, Ovis, bontebok and gemsbok have white stockings. Again, communication is the likely function.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s {{musicians and}} high {{fidelity}} enthusiasts found that lifting speakers {{off the ground}} and mounting them on something with no vibration increased sound quality. Ordinary domestic furniture was not built with the properties that would deaden vibrations and so enhance the speaker's sound. Speaker stands, therefore were purpose-built to remove any deleterious <b>colourations</b> that came about through unwanted vibration.|$|R
50|$|This solitary ascidian is {{sometimes}} referred to as the red-throated ascidian, as its two siphons are a vivid red in colour. However, most solitary ascidians that are encountered are so covered in algae that the coloration is often not visible. When found at depth the red <b>colourations</b> may also not be visible, as lower frequencies of light are absorbed by the layers of water above.|$|R
5|$|Some species, such {{as white}} peacocks, swans and geese, are not {{believed}} to be true albinos, as {{they do not have}} red eyes, rather, their <b>colouration</b> is suggested to be the expression of a white fur or feather gene, not a lack of melanin.|$|E
