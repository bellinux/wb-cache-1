50|$|<b>Caustic</b> <b>embrittlement</b> is the {{phenomenon}} {{in which the}} material of a boiler becomes brittle due to the accumulation of caustic substances.|$|E
50|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracking {{is a phenomenon}} where a synergistic action of corrosion and tensile stress leads to brittle fracture of normally ductile materials at generally lower stress levels. During stress {{corrosion cracking}}, the material is relatively unattacked by the corrosive agent, but fine cracks form within it. This process has serious implications on {{the utility of the}} material because the applicable safe stress levels are drastically reduced in the corrosive medium. Season cracking and <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement</b> are two stress corrosion cracking processes which affected the serviceability of brass cartridge cases and riveted steel boilers respectively.|$|E
50|$|Boiler explosions {{generally}} {{fell into}} two categories. The {{first is the}} breakage of the boiler barrel itself, through weakness/damage or excessive internal pressure, resulting in sudden discharge of steam over a wide area. Stress corrosion cracking at the lap joints was a common cause of early boiler explosions, probably caused by <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement.</b> The water used in boilers was not often closely controlled, and if acidic, could corrode the wrought iron boiler plates. Galvanic corrosion was an additional problem where copper and iron were in contact.Boiler plates have been thrown up to {{a quarter of a}} mile (Hewison, Rolt). The second type is the collapse of the firebox under steam pressure from the adjoining boiler, releasing flames and hot gases into the cab. Improved design and maintenance almost totally eliminated the first type, but the second type is always possible if the engineer and fireman do not maintain the water level in the boiler.|$|E
30|$|Major {{problems}} {{occurring in}} the boilers are agglomeration, high temperature corrosion, slagging, fouling, <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement</b> and fatigue failure.|$|E

30|$|<b>Caustic</b> <b>embrittlement</b> in boilers is {{a natural}} process and can be {{prevented}} temporarily by adding a combination of chemicals consisting of a sufficient amount of sodium sulfate in normal boiler water [50]. Caustic cracking occurs in solutions, where mixed active and passive control of corrosion is operative [51]. We can prevent <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement</b> by adding compounds such as sodium sulphite, tannin, lignin, and phosphate, because it blocks the cracks presented by infiltration of alkali [52].|$|E
30|$|The {{process of}} <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement</b> occurs in boilers {{and leads to}} {{formation}} of cracks on the riveted mild steel plates. The temperature ranges from 200 to 250  °C, which further leads to deposition of concentrated hydroxide on the waterside of the boiler [46]. We can also explain <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement</b> as a phenomenon where boiler becomes brittle, due to accumulation of caustic soda [47]. <b>Caustic</b> <b>embrittlement</b> {{is also known as}} stress corrosion cracking [46]. <b>Caustic</b> <b>embrittlement</b> is caused due to the presence of caustic soda in the boiler feed water, which is in direct contact with the steel and drums of the boiler [48]. In the boiler, when the water evaporates, the concentration of sodium carbonate increases. Sodium carbonate is used for the softening of water via. lime soda process. During this process, there are chances that some of the sodium carbonate particles may be left behind. With the passage of time, the concentration of sodium carbonate increases, and it undergoes hydrolysis to form sodium hydroxide. When the concentration of sodium hydroxide increases by a certain amount, it makes water alkaline. This alkaline water enters into small cracks of inner walls of the boiler. Evaporation of this water leads to a continuous increase in the amount of sodium hydroxide present in the boiler tubes. This sodium hydroxide attacks the iron present on the boilers and dissolves it; thus, forming sodium ferrate, which further leads to <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement</b> [49].|$|E
40|$|A typical hot {{concentrated}} alkaline corrosion environment {{exists in}} alumina metallurgical industry, so that steel materials with outstanding alkaline corrosion resistance are strongly demanded for its processing equipment. In this paper, the corrosion resistance of {{two kinds of}} martensitic cast steels containing chromium in static 303 g/L NaOH alkaline solution at 85 ℃ was studied through polarization and potential-time curves, corrosion weight loss and corrosion morphology analysis. Experimental results showed that protection effect by passive film of cast steel containing Cr was temporary. The low carbon steel without Cr content also exhibited chemical passivity in the same solution. The corrosion mode of the tested Cr-containing cast steel was composed of active dissolving corrosion and <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement</b> cracking. Dissolving corrosion was the primary mechanism for the induced weight loss, while severe <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement</b> cracking was secondary. With the increase of chromium content in the cast steel, the tendency of the <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement</b> cracking decreased, while the active dissolving corrosion increased...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of the Bayer process for the extraction of alumina from Bauxite ore, there is a push for increasing processing temperature and caustic concentrations, which has also led to an increased concern for <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement.</b> In this study, the caustic cracking behaviour of steel in Bayer solutions of 2. 5, 5, 7. 5 and 10 moldm "free caustic" concentrations have been studied at different temperatures using pre-cracked circumferential notch tensile specimens. It has been observed that at 100 °C, steel is susceptible to caustic cracking {{in each of the four}} Bayer solutions. Caustic cracking has also been observed at temperatures as low as 55 °C. Tests were also conducted using only the notched specimens (i. e., without pre-cracking) in a 7. 5 moldm "free caustic" Bayer solution at 120 °C to study the stress corrosion crack formation and propagation behaviour in blunt notches...|$|E
30|$|In {{engineering}} applications, {{there are}} various types of boilers such as water tube boilers, fire tube boilers, packaged boiler, fluidized bed combustion boiler, pulverized fuel boiler and waste heat boilers. These boilers are used in different industries such as power plants, paper, and chemical. The present paper reports various problems (such as agglomeration, slagging, fouling, <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement,</b> fatigue failure and high temperature corrosion) related to boilers and their possible solutions. Some of the controlling parameters for high temperature corrosion has also been studied viz use of inhibitors, varying temperature and pressure, sol–gel coating and thermal spray coating. Thermal spraying {{has emerged as a}} main tool for improvement in surface. Problem of corrosion, wear resistance, electrical or thermal insulation can be altered using different coating techniques and materials. Deposition of ash in biomass-fired boilers also causes severe problems of agglomeration. The problem of agglomeration can be solved using kaolin or NH 3 in the bed of boilers. Some important processes such as pulse detonation wave technology, intelligent soot blower, chemical treatment technology can be used to minimize the effects of fouling.|$|E
30|$|A boiler is {{a closed}} vessel {{producing}} heat by the combustion of fuel which {{is transferred to}} water for its conversion into steam at desired temperature and pressure [1]. They are vastly used in power plants, paper industry, chemical industries, water treatment plants, textile industry, building material industry and food industry. They are also {{being used in the}} tobacco industry, food packaging, refineries, metal work industries, hospitals, distilleries, waste incinerators, print offices and many more [2]. The efficiency of these industries is very much dependent upon boiler’s efficiency. Hence, it is necessary to carry out the maintenance of boiler at regular intervals so as to avoid any unwanted shutdown. However, operation of boiler leads to number of problems such as agglomeration, slagging, fouling, <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement,</b> fatigue failure and hot corrosion which are responsible for their unwanted shutdown [3]. Moreover, fireside of boilers suffers maximum damage. Hence, it is necessary to find the solutions either to avoid or to remove such type of problems in the boiler. Therefore, in the present paper effort has been made to discuss the problems as well as their possible solutions according to the available literature.|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} {{experiment to}} determine the pre-mature failure of a waste heat boiler steel plate. A failure investigation of a welded waste heat boiler steel shell that developed transverse cracks {{was carried out in}} 1996 {{to determine the}} cause of failure as well as propose measures to be adopted to prevent similar failures occurring in the future. The boiler had been in service for several years before two cracks across two traversing circumferential welds were discovered on the underside during routine inspection. Chemical and metallographic analyses indicated that the boiler plate was made from a conventional C-Mn steel and that it was certainly suitable forthe purpose. The boiler interior showed massive deposition of a calcareous sludge on the walls and tube bundles. This was attributed to an excessive use of sodium orthophosphate to reduce the hardness of the boiler feed water. The high levels of Na+and P 043 ions found in both the sludge and boiler feed water analyses were taken as confirmatory evidence. Feed water quality monitored data forthe period January 1994 to October 1995 showed pH values that were in excess of 12. 4, a figure much higher than the recommended pH range of 8 to 11. The high pH is thought to have been responsible for the occurrence of cracking as a result of <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement.</b> This point of view is supported by the observation of intergranular separation in the microstructures adjacent to the crack paths...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{complexities}} involved in both microbiologically influenced corrosion and deterioration of reinforced concrete structures by algae are explained. In this regards, the five possible corrosion/deterioration mechanisms {{that may be}} expected are addressed and described. These mechanisms are as follows: Absorption of some chemicals necessary for the algae from within the cement paste of the concrete: this mechanism can finally result in drying out the concrete and developing cracks {{as a result of}} formation of internal cavities and voids. Biofilm formation and increasing the likelihood of attracting more micro-/macroorganisms that can either deteriorate the concrete itself or the reinforcement steel inside, or both. An example as such can be development of an environment favorable for the acid-producing sulphur oxidizing bacteria that through generating very acidic conditions are capable of doing harm to both metallic and non-metallic phases of the reinforced concrete. Development of electrochemical cells such as differential aeration cells due to the photosynthetic driven oxygen production and consumption features of algae. In this way, it is likely that spots of varying oxygen partial pressures will be created, tus facilitating the corrosion of the steel inside. Production of acids that can be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of both concrete and steel reinforcement. Production of alkaline conditions that upon varying and fluctuating due to the chemistry of the system, can protect the concrete but do damage to the steel phase via mechanisms such as <b>caustic</b> <b>embrittlement.</b> The aim of this review paper is to gather all possible mechanisms that may be involved in explaining the contribution of algae to the bio-corrosion/bio-deterioration of reinforced concrete...|$|E
