40|$|In {{response}} to a growing teacher shortage, increasing numbers of secondary teachers are prepared through streamlined certification programs. For this reason, assessing candidates' <b>content</b> <b>area</b> knowledge gained from {{institutions of higher education}} across the United States is an important program admission factor as candidates must demonstrate <b>content</b> <b>area</b> knowledge by passing a Texas <b>content</b> <b>area</b> certification test (TExES). This study examines content knowledge for candidates enrolled in an online post­-baccalaureate program from September 1, 2002 through April 30, 2005. Academic transcript analysis and grades 8 -­ 12 subject tests of the TExES were used as a proxy for subject matter knowledge for a sample of individuals seeking initial teacher certification in a post­-baccalaureate teacher certification at the University of North Texas. Descriptive data,linear regression, and logistic regression analyses were used to draw conclusions about the <b>content</b> <b>area</b> knowledge of the individuals in the sample. Scores on the TExES were used to determine the relationships between the <b>content</b> <b>area</b> knowledge of initial certification students and the number of <b>content</b> <b>area</b> courses completed, the grade point averages, and time elapsed between the completion of the last <b>content</b> <b>area</b> course and the student's initial attempt on the TExES. Results differed by the <b>content</b> <b>area</b> of the candidates. Analysis of variance results indicate significant differences between the five test groups with regard to number of courses taken F(4, 139) = 9. 334, p <. 001 grade point average F(4, 139) = 5. 733, p <. 001 and time between the last course taken F(4, 139) = 6. 135, p <. 001. The three­-predictor model was statistically significant F(3, 32) = 3. 753, p =. 02 for the History test group.

Despite efforts to teach secondary teachers how to implement <b>content</b> <b>area</b> literacy in the classroom, researchers have noted resistance to taking up literacy within content classrooms. We offer a way to impact adolescent literacy by taking up interdisciplinary instruction as the backdrop by which we engage teachers in learning about <b>content</b> <b>area</b> literacy. In this new context, <b>content</b> <b>area</b> literacy is (re) conceptualized from a self-centered approach, looking within one 2 ̆ 7 s own discipline, to a holistic approach where all disciplines recognize the literacy needs and requirements within and across the disciplines.

40|$|Abstract. Designing {{effective}} <b>content</b> <b>area</b> texts requires {{attention to}} both organi-zation {{of the content}} and the instructional strategies used to highlight important in-formation. Content should be organized to show relationships among factual infor-mation, concepts, rules, and organizational structures at both the lesson and the curricular level. Instructional strategies should be organized to highlight, integrate, and apply critical concepts and to provide cumulative review of those concepts across the curriculum. Can American high schools teach stu-dents to think, to use their minds to solve complex problems? Or are American schools destined to follow the familiar path of passing on numer-ous fragmented bits of information that students memorize, but soon for-get? (Newmann, 1990, p. 41) Newmann's questions reiterate a common re-frain among educators and researchers con-cerned with learning in the content areas: How can we ensure that a diverse population of learn-ers, particularly students with learning disabili-ties, profit from engaging with <b>content</b> <b>area</b> ma-terial? How do we assist them in collecting "fragmented bits of information " and under-standing and using them as a complex whole? This article begins to answer one aspect of this challenge by (a) briefly describing problems with <b>content</b> <b>area</b> textbooks, and (b) reviewing {{ways to improve the}} content organization and instructional strategies of <b>content</b> <b>area</b> texts.
