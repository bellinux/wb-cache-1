Although context is generally readily available in the physical world, that is not always the case in digital information systems. <b>Collaborative</b> learning <b>platforms,</b> which may include diverse topic areas, particularly suffer from the lack of context, making it difficult to obtain the most appropriate information. In this paper we discuss a digital information system that is used as a <b>collaborative</b> learning <b>platform</b> by students and experts. We explore the concept of context and its potential benefits to <b>collaborative</b> learning <b>platforms.</b> We then present the Knowledge Exchange <b>collaborative</b> learning <b>platform</b> and describe how it uses context to help users obtain the appropriate information. Examples illustrating the advantages of the Knowledge Exchange’s use of context are provided. 1...|$|R
40|$|Many {{organizations}} {{struggle to}} reap the benefits of working collaboratively to create innovation. This paper explores the challenges and tensions related to shifting towards joint value capture as opposed to value creation in <b>collaborative</b> <b>platforms.</b> It is based on collaborative research studies of three <b>collaborative</b> <b>platforms</b> within a Swedish automotive ecosystem. We utilize the notion of “strange loops” to analyze our findings, and identify four relational indicators that can explicate the paradoxical situation where the collaborators are willing but unable to shift towards joint value capture. The paper contributes to literature on collaborative innovation by adopting a relational perspective in the analysis, thereby clarifying how value and meaning emerging from speech acts can have significant influence on the value capture process in a collaboration...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe work {{reported}} here relates to <b>collaborative</b> <b>platforms</b> {{used in the}} knowledge management domain. Although these environments provide substantial help, first-time users are disinclined to use them because they are data- (or document-) centred. In this article, we study how new <b>collaborative</b> <b>platforms</b> for knowledge management can be more “user-centred”. The approach is based on observation of the collaborative activities in which the users are involved, in order to regulate the process better. The “traces” of the activity left by the different users of the platform are central in our approach, in order to exhibit specific indicators. Opposing a techno-centred and a user-centred approach, based on a real case study, a methodological framework to construct these indicators according to the real users’ needs is thus proposed, {{as well as a}} tool...|$|R

40|$|Collaboration and {{collaborative}} environments {{have been playing}} an increasingly {{important role in the}} construction domain. Designing and process modeling, knowledge management and dissemination, communities of practice – this is just an initial list of the building-related activities that benefit from collaboration- and services approaches characterizing the construction industry. In this paper, we discuss the phenomenon of collaboration in construction, study the existing <b>collaborative</b> <b>platforms</b> that are used (or might be applicable) for different building-related activities and identify the main challenges that are currently not addressed in the current researches. We furthermore underline the role of services-oriented technologies for modeling industry- and business-related processes, and show how they have been de facto implemented for the construction industry. Despite a large number of different fit-for-purpose <b>collaborative</b> <b>platforms</b> for construction, we nevertheless underline the necessity of a semantically rich collaborative environment for heterogeneous construction experts {{that would allow them to}} keep their own terminology and working practices, but to acquire a shared understanding of a common task without losing its integrity. In order to do so, we introduce our services-based approach for actionalizing the expert knowledg...|$|R
40|$|Content-based online <b>collaborative</b> <b>platforms</b> {{and office}} {{applications}} {{are widely used}} for collaborating and exchanging data, in particular {{in the form of}} XML-based electronic documents. Usually, a version control system is built-in in these applications to support collaboration and to properly manage document evolution. However, most version control models require error-prone and time-consuming manual management of conflicts and uncertainties, thus heavily affecting collaborative work. Since in collaborative contexts conflicts are of a more semantic nature, i. e., due to uncertainty on what is really true, we focus on a version control model that deals with uncertain data. We introduce an XML version control model to assess uncertainty in data and to automatically resolve conflicts. Office documents and those of content-based online <b>collaborative</b> <b>platforms</b> are described in XML. We give features and requirements of our targeted model by identifying important characteristics of versioning systems, in particular XML version control systems. As first results, we propose a version-space formalism for collaborative data and we put forward an uncertainty management approach by translating the problem in the framework of XML data integration...|$|R
