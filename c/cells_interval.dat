This OPNET ATM model contains enhanced features to support the QoS capabilities of ATM, and a comprehensive ABR feedback model. We describe the various features of the ATM model, and use it for our simulation and analysis. NOTICE: This document has been prepared to assist the ATM Forum.

30|$|There {{are several}} classes of data {{structures}} {{that are very}} useful to avoid the processing of empty cells. One of them consists of interval-based representations, which uses <b>cell</b> <b>intervals</b> to group cells [32]. The advantage {{of this type of}} representation is in its flexibility, being applied not only on regular grids, but also on non-regular grids, once it works from an interval space, instead of using the mesh space itself.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a space {{efficient}} algorithm for speeding up isosurface extraction. Even though there exist algorithms that can achieve optimal search performance to identify isosurface cells, they prove impractical for large datasets due to a high storage overhead. With the dual goals of achieving fast isosurface extraction and simultaneously reducing the space requirement, we introduce an algorithm based on transform coding to compress the interval information of the cells in a dataset. Compression is achieved by first transforming the <b>cell</b> <b>intervals</b> (minima, maxima) into a form which allows more efficient compaction. It {{is followed by a}} dataset optimized non-uniform quantization stage. The compressed data is stored in a data structure that allows fast searches in the compression domain, thus eliminating the need to retrieve the original representation of intervals at run-time. The space requirement of our search data structure is the mandatory cost of storing every cell id once, plus an overhead for quantization information. The overhead is typically in the order of a few hundredths of the dataset size...|$|R

30|$|Seismic interferometry, {{which employs}} {{continuous}} ambient noise or microtremor records, {{is used to}} characterize seismic wave propagation in the Earth and has been widely applied in pure and engineering seismology on various scales (e.g., Shapiro and Campillo 2004; Sabra et al. 2005; Bensen et al. 2007; Yamanaka et al. 2010; Seats et al. 2012; Denolle et al. 2014; Hayashida et al. 2014; Lin et al. 2014; Viens et al. 2016). Ma et al. (2008) tested two community velocity models for the Los Angeles area that were developed by the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) by comparing observed inter-station Green’s functions extracted by correlating the vertical components of ambient seismic noise recorded at 56 broadband stations with those simulated by the finite element method. Chimoto and Yamanaka (2011) conducted tomographic analysis to map surface wave group velocities {{in the southern part}} of the Kanto area of Japan with a <b>cell</b> <b>interval</b> of 0.125 °. They used the observed group velocity data from inter-station Green’s functions estimated by means of seismic interferometry analysis of continuous microtremor data. Denolle et al.

40|$|The ATM Available Bit Rate (ABR) service {{category}} was initially designed to support non-real-time applications. However {{it is possible}} for ABR to support real-time applications, such as multimedia applications, by taking advantage of the inherent traffic control capability of ABR and the adaptation ability of real-time applications. Using a proper switch traffic control algorithm, ABR queues in the switches can be kept within acceptable bounds and therefore a loose end-to-end delay bound can be guaranteed. FASTRAC is a simple, scalable, provably stable, explicit rate computation scheme for flow control in computer networks. The main objective of the present thesis is to study how to transmit real-time video over ABR service using FASTRAC rate control algorithm. Using OPNET simulation tool, we study the effect of Resource Management (RM) <b>cell</b> <b>interval,</b> control delay and stability factor. With the simulation experiments, we study the performance of the rate control algorithm when it supports real-time video applications using fixed weight allocation scheme. To overcome the problems with the fixed weight allocation scheme, we introduce a dynamic weight allocation scheme, allowing us to improve the rate allocation among all ABR connections. Our simulation results also show that the spare link capacity can be further utilized by transmitting non-real-time applications without affecting the QoS of the real-time video applications...|$|R

50|$|In {{the oldest}} and most popular {{sampling}} approach, the region to be covered is gridded and volunteers are expected to visit representative locations within each grid cell and gather data that is subsequently collated. The method of collecting data, time and season in which to obtain the sample information are pre-decided as part of a protocol. In some cases the numbers and species of birds that are found to be breeding are recorded, others may use timed point sampling or transects within the grid cells to obtain quantitative estimates of abundance. In some countries the grid cells follow the latitudes and longitudes - <b>cell</b> <b>intervals</b> of 1 degree, 30 and 15 minutes are often chosen for convenience. In higher latitudes where such an approaches leads to grid cells with large differences in area, sizes are more often fixed using grid distances of 1, 2, 5, 10 or even 50 km grid intervals. A disadvantage with grids is that boundaries rarely match those of habitats, making them unsuitable for ecological studies. Another problem is that the data collected in one project cannot be readily reused with new grid alignments that may be needed for instance when combining information with other projects. Repeat atlases made after a decade or two have helped in identifying long term range changes.|$|R
40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at link. springer. comInterval protection or partial cell suppression was introduced in “M. Fischetti, J. -J. Salazar, Partial cell suppression: A new methodology for statistical disclosure control, Statistics and Computing, 13, 13 – 21, 2003 ” as a “linearization” of the difficult <b>cell</b> suppression problem. <b>Interval</b> protection replaces some <b>cells</b> by <b>intervals</b> containing the original cell value, unlike in cell suppression where the values are suppressed. Although the resulting optimization problem is still huge—as in cell suppression, it is linear, thus allowing the application of efficient procedures. In this work we present preliminary results with a prototype implementation of Benders decomposition for interval protection. Although the above seminal publication about partial cell suppression applied a similar methodology, our approach differs in two aspects: (i) {{the boundaries of the}} intervals are completely independent in our implementation, whereas the one of 2003 solved a simpler variant where boundaries must satisfy a certain ratio; (ii) our prototype is applied to a set of seven general and hierarchical tables, whereas only three two-dimensional tables were solved with the implementation of 2003.

40|$|The genome of the heterocyst-forming {{cyanobacterium}} Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 harbors 14 genes {{containing a}} GGDEF diguanylate cyclase domain. We found that inactivation {{of one of}} these genes, all 2874, caused abnormal heterocyst development. The all 2874 mutant showed a pronounced reduction in heterocyst frequency during diazotrophic growth and reduced vegetative cell size compared to the wild type. The severity of the mutant phenotype varied with light intensity; at high light intensity, the mutant phenotype was accentuated, whereas at low light intensity the phenotype was similar to wild type. Under high-light growth conditions, the initial heterocyst frequency and pattern for the all 2874 mutant were normal, but within 4 days following nitrogen step-down, many intervals between heterocysts increased to as many as 200 vegetative cells, whereas in the wild type the intervals were less than 25 vegetative cells. Filaments containing these unusually long vegetative <b>cell</b> <b>intervals</b> between heterocysts also contained intervals of normal length. An all 2874 mutant strain carrying a PpatS-gfp transcriptional reporter fusion failed to show normal upregulation of the reporter, which indicates that the decrease in heterocyst frequency is due to an early block in differentiation before induction of the patS gene, which in the wild type takes place 8 h after nitrogen step-down. Genetic epistasis experiments suggest that All 2874 acts upstream of the master regulator HetR in differentiating cells. We also showed that purified All 2874 functions as a diguanylate cyclase in vitro. We hypothesize that All 2874 is required for the normal regulation of heterocyst frequency under high-light growth conditions...|$|R
