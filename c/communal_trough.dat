Two principal design features can characterize a feeder : the way pigs will be fed (wet, dry or wet/dry) and its capacity, which depends in turn on the trough length {{or the number of}} feeding spaces (mono - or multi- space feeder and <b>communal</b> <b>trough).</b> To determine the number of pigs that can be accommodated per feeder, the daily time spent per pig at the feeder - depending on pig size and feed delivered - must be taken into account. Recommendations of 4 to 10 weaned pigs per feeding space are generally given. Pigs are able to adapt their eating behaviour when crowding occurs but suboptimal situations may reduce feed intake and productivity and even impair welfare. Some particularities of the feeder such as limited depth, feeder gap opening, lip height, side panels or protective crate can limit feed spillage and/ or agonistic interactions at the feeder. Feeder position in the pen should prevent pigs to be disturbed while eating and allow free movement of penmates. Peer reviewe...|$|E

They are usually located near middens, out of which animal bones and shells are eroding. Little appears to be known about the purpose and origins of these structures. Although the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland attributes them to prehistory, it is also possible that they are Norse in origin. A kidney-shaped burnt mound located near Castle Geo in the south-east of Stroma can be more confidently ascribed to prehistory. It consists of an accumulation of cracked and scorched stones that were used to heat water in a <b>communal</b> cooking <b>trough.</b> Although the example on Stroma has not been dated, burnt mounds found elsewhere on Orkney and Shetland have been dated to the Bronze Age and the early Iron Age.|$|R
