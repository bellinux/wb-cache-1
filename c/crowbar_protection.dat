First, {{the design of the}} busbar system and its support structure is described, which are required to carry 15 kA current for long pulse operation of up to 25 minutes and fault condition of 400 kA for 1 second. Additional elements in the power supply system include a bidirectional <b>crowbar,</b> varistor <b>protection</b> assemblies, and a high current bus switch. Secondly, multi-physics analyses involved in the design are presented. Electro-magnetic analysis is performed to evaluate the spreading load of the two current-carrying busbars while Joule heating with thermal racheting analysis is to estimate the temperature rise in the components.

40|$|Doubly-fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG) -based wind turbines utilise small-scale voltage sourced converters {{with a limited}} overcurrent withstand capability, which makes the DFIG-based wind turbines very vulnerable to grid faults.
