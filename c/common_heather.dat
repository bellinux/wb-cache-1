5|$|Deciduous forests cover 80% of the park's {{area and}} belong to 28 forest and 18 bush habitats. This variety {{is due to}} the lower river valleys, the sea coast and the karstic terrain. These include forests of oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), sessile oak (Quercus petraea), Strandzhan oak (Quercus hartwissiana), Hungarian oak (Quercus frainetto), common {{hornbeam}} (Carpinus betulus), oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis) and small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) with undergrowth of pontic rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum), Caucasian whortleberry (Vaccinium arctostaphylos), cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus), Black Sea holly (Ilex colchica), Himalayan meadow primrose (Primula rosea) and <b>common</b> <b>heather</b> (Calluna).|$|E
5|$|The {{coastline}} is {{well known}} for its colourful flowers including sea aster, sea squill, sea thrift, common sea-lavender, bell and <b>common</b> <b>heather.</b> The Scottish primrose is found only on the coasts of Orkney and nearby Caithness and Sutherland. Although stands of trees are generally rare, a small forest named Happy Valley with 700 trees and lush gardens was created from a boggy hillside near Stenness {{during the second half of}} the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The site of {{the fort}} and warren is now grassy slopes which attract {{a wide range of}} wild flowers and butterflies. The differing soil types provide {{suitable}} habitats for both acid- and lime-loving plants. Kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), harebell (Campanula rotundifolia) and woolly thistle (Cirsium eriophorum) thrive on the dry stony soils. Heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile) and wood sage (Teucrium scorodonia) are found in more acidic areas. The higher areas support bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and <b>common</b> <b>heather</b> (Calluna vulgaris). Trees and shrubs include the wayfaring tree (Viburnum lantana), guelder rose (Viburnum opulus), whitebeam (Sorbus aria), privet (Ligustrum vulgare) and dogwood (Cornus sanguinea).|$|E

5|$|Clover, sorrel, nettle and thistle are common, {{and grow}} wild in Greater Manchester. <b>Common</b> <b>heather</b> (Calluna vulgaris) dominates the uplands, such as Saddleworth Moor, which lies within the South Pennines and Dark Peak {{area of the}} Peak District National Park. The Rochdale Canal {{harbours}} floating water-plantain (Luronium), an endangered aquatic plant. In 2002, Plantlife International launched its County Flowers campaign, asking {{members of the public}} to nominate and vote for a wild flower emblem for their county. Common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), a plant with fluffy white plumes native to wet hollows on high moors, was announced as the county flower of Greater Manchester. The house sparrow, common starling, and common blackbird are among the most populous bird species in Greater Manchester; Eurasian magpie and feral pigeon are common and breed in habitats across the county. The South Pennines support internationally important numbers of European golden plover, curlew, merlin and twite.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>common</b> <b>heather</b> (Calluna vulgaris) only a few taller plants occur here, none {{of which can be}} classed as characteristic species. Amongst them are the wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa) and common juniper (Juniperus communis). Ordinary sand heath is the most widespread of the heathland types. Its proportion has increased in recent decades {{at the expense of other}} heath habitats. This reduction in the variety of heathland types may be due to increasing nitrogen levels from the air, the increase in plant litter (Rohhumusauflagen) and the natural ageing of the heathland.|$|E
25|$|Wind {{pollination}} is {{the reproductive}} strategy {{adopted by the}} grasses, sedges, rushes and catkin-bearing plants. Other flowering plants are mostly pollinated by insects (or birds or bats), {{which seems to be}} the primitive state, and some plants have secondarily developed wind pollination. Some plants that are wind pollinated have vestigial nectaries, and other plants like <b>common</b> <b>heather</b> that are regularly pollinated by insects, produce clouds of pollen and some wind pollination is inevitable. The hoary plantain is primarily wind pollinated, but is also visited by insects which pollinate it. In general, showy, colourful, fragrant flowers like sunflowers, orchids and Buddleja are insect pollinated. The only entomophilous plants that are not seed plants are the dung-mosses of the family Splachnaceae.|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} that among angiosperms, {{entomophily}} is the primitive state; this is indicated by the vestigial nectaries in the wind-pollinated Urtica and other plants, {{and the presence of}} fragrances in some of these plants. Of the angiosperms, grasses, sedges, rushes and catkin-bearing plants are in general wind pollinated. Other flowering plants are mostly biotic, the pollen being carried by animal vectors. However a number of plants in multiple families have secondarily adopted wind pollination in contrast to other members of their groups. Some plants are intermediate between the two pollination methods. <b>common</b> <b>heather</b> is regularly pollinated by insects, but produce clouds of pollen and some wind pollination is inevitable, and the hoary plantain is primarily wind pollinated, but is also visited by insects which pollinate it.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{drainage}} {{of water}} from the bogs as a result of human activity, most of Wicklow's peat has dried out too much for Sphagnum mosses to grow and moorland and heath vegetation has taken over. Active peat building is still occurring at some sites, most notably the Liffey Head Bog. <b>Common</b> <b>heather</b> (or ling) and bell heather are the most common moorland plants along with bilberry (or fraughan, as it is known in Ireland), bog cotton, deergrass and purple moor grass. Bird species found on the Wicklow moorland include red grouse, meadow pipit and skylark. Birds of prey found in the uplands include kestrels, hen harriers, merlins and peregrine falcons. The latter of these are protected species. The uplands are used for sheep grazing and so the moorland is periodically burned to keep the growth of heather in check and encourage growth of grasses.|$|E
25|$|The heath and its {{surrounding}} area belong to those regions of the North German Plain in which the hunter culture of the Mesolithic era was superseded quite early on by Neolithic farmers. By about 3000 BC, during the Neolithic, large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating, sandy stretches of geest on Lüneburg Heath. This {{was a result of}} the intensive grazing of the sessile oak woods and the associated destruction of successive new stands of trees. These open areas became dominated by the <b>common</b> <b>heather</b> (Calluna vulgaris), a largely grazing-resistant species of plant. Nevertheless, oak and beech woods succeeded time and again in establishing themselves wherever man left areas of heath untended. Over {{a long period of time}} the region of Lüneburg Heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed. Finally, after the migration period, the wooded areas of the region increased considerably.|$|E
50|$|Colletes succinctus, the <b>common</b> colletes or <b>heather</b> colletes, is {{a species}} of Palearctic mining bee from the family Colletidae. It {{is part of the}} succintus species group within the genus Colletes and is {{especially}} closely related to the ivy bee (Colletes hederae) and the sea aster mining bee (Colletes halophilus) with are partially sympatric with C. succintus but ecologically separate.|$|R
50|$|The Ericaceae are {{a family}} of {{flowering}} plants, {{commonly known as the}} heath or heather family, found most commonly in acid and infertile growing conditions. The family is large, with c. 4250 known species spread across 124 genera, making it the 14th most species-rich family of flowering plants. The many well-known and economically important members of the Ericaceae include the cranberry, blueberry, huckleberry, rhododendron (including azaleas), and various <b>common</b> heaths and <b>heathers</b> (Erica, Cassiope, Daboecia, and Calluna for example).|$|R
5000|$|Burning of moorland {{has been}} practised {{for a number}} of reasons, for example when grazing is {{insufficient}} to control growth. This is recorded in Britain in the fourteenth century. Uncontrolled burning frequently caused (and causes) problems, and was forbidden by statute in 1607. With the rise of sheep and grouse management in the nineteenth century it again became <b>common</b> practice. <b>Heather</b> is burnt at about 10 or 12 years old when it will regenerate easily. Left longer, the woodier stems will burn more aggressively and will hinder regrowth. Burning of moorland vegetation needs to be very carefully controlled as the peat itself can catch fire, and this can be difficult if not impossible to extinguish. In addition, uncontrolled burning of heather can promote alternative bracken and rough grass growth which ultimately produces poorer grazing. As a result, burning is now a controversial practice; Rackham calls it [...] "second-best land management".|$|R
2500|$|There {{are large}} areas of bog in Boho, [...] typified by species such as bell heather, cross-leaved heath and ling (<b>common</b> <b>heather).</b> Additionally species such as [...] sundew (which are carnivorous) and bog asphodels can be found.|$|E
2500|$|A {{large part}} of the park (36%) {{consists}} of naked rock, and is thus a poor substrate for vegetation. The principal trees are dwarf pines which have not been affected by logging and which thus can be up to 500 years old. Besides these small trees, the vegetation is almost wholly of a shrubby nature, with <b>common</b> <b>heather</b> (...) , common juniper (...) , or bearberry (...) [...] These zones are also home to a large number of species of mosses and lichens.|$|E
2500|$|Blueberries (Vaccinium myrtillus) are the {{signature}} species {{of this type}} of heath and, more rarely, [...] cranberries (Vaccinium vitis-idaea). Blueberry heath is the second most common type of vegetation on the heathlands and occurs especially on northern slopes, the edges of woods and thick juniper hedges. This type of heath is particularly characteristic of the northern slopes of the Wilseder Berg, as well as the Steingrund and Totengrund. In those places, cranberries have even ousted the <b>common</b> <b>heather</b> (Calluna vulgaris) in places.|$|E
5|$|At higher elevations, {{mountain}} hemlock and subalpine fir are {{the most}} common trees. Alaska cedar and whitebark pine are also present. However, as the elevation increases, the forest becomes increasingly fragmented, and is interspersed with meadows consisting of grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Scree slopes are also common. Temperatures can vary greatly within one day due to the high altitude of the habitat and lack of forest cover. For the same reasons, the parkland also experiences increased solar radiation. At the upper edge of the parkland, trees tend to be stunted, and grow in small clumps. <b>Common</b> shrubs include <b>heather</b> and mountain huckleberry. Off-trail hiking can be very destructive in the sub-alpine zone.|$|R
5000|$|Gillies Hill hosts a large {{array of}} plants native to Central Scotland. The hill {{is home to}} at least 38 Ancient Woodland {{indicator}} species from the AWVP - Europe/National/Scotland list and 21 from the AWVP - Scotland list, a record Scots Pine, a record Rowan, and an abundance of wildflower, lichen, fungi, moss, and grass species. Eight of the top ten Scottish plants listed on the Scottish Biodiversity List (a list of flora, fauna and habitats considered by Scottish Ministers to be of principal importance for biodiversity) as most popular among Scots {{can be found on}} Gillies Hill: <b>common</b> and bell <b>heather,</b> Scottish bluebell or harebell, Scots Pine, oak, thistle, rowan, ferns, and common spotted and Northern marsh orchids.

50|$|Inland {{birds are}} fewer in numbers. Oyster catcher (Haematopus ostralegus) (the {{national}} bird), curlew (Numenius), common snipe (Capella gallinago) and tern (Sterna) are <b>common</b> on the <b>heather</b> hills. The Faroese starling (sub-species Sturnus vulgaris faroeensis) {{is the biggest}} starling in the world, and is very common in and around human habitation together with the sparrow (Passer). In later years they have been joined by blackbirds (Turdus merula) which are growing very fast in numbers. Crows (Corvus cornix) and the Faroese-Icelandic subspecies of raven (Corvus corax varius) are also very common around human habitation. Until the 19th century a special coloured raven, the pied raven was common on the islands. This was not a special race, but a colour variation of the Faroese-Icelandic sub-species. In the same nest, three youngsters could be black while one could be white-speckled. This colour variation was unique to the Faroe Islands, and maybe because of this, the demand from foreign collectors was big for these ravens. This might be a reason why it became extinct; the last white-speckled raven was seen on Nólsoy in 1949.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the areas}} of damp heath, the {{predominant}} species when the site was designated an SSSI in 1963 were <b>common</b> <b>heather</b> (Calluna vulgaris), cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), common gorse (Ulex europaeus), western gorse (U. gallii) and purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea). These areas also of [...] bog moss (Sphagnum). A total of 50 species of bryophytes have been recorded at the site, including the large white-moss (Leucobryum glaucum), which is rare in Cheshire. Other locally rare species that have been observed here include bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), common lousewort (Pedicularis sylvatica) and round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the valleys}} {{and on the}} mountainside, in contrast, the diabase and the better weather permit a richer vegetation. In particular, these areas are {{blanketed}} in forest, with the plant species varying with altitude: moor birch, Scots pine and Norway spruce cover , [...] and , respectively. The undergrowth also presents great diversity in plant life. To wit, the south-facing slopes are principally covered in Scots pines and their undergrowth strongly resembles heath, with in particular <b>common</b> <b>heather</b> and crowberry. The rest of the coniferous forests include most often whortleberry, northern oak fern, woundwort, and common cow-wheat. The soil rich in diabase allows the growth of more demanding plants, such as Alpine blue-sow-thistle, wood cranesbill [...] and northern wolfsbane.
