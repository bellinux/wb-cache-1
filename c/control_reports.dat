40|$|Nowadays, {{there exist}} two {{reporting}} regimes, rules-based and principle-based (comply-or-explain). In the rules-based environment, researchers {{have studied the}} relationship between internal control quality and accounting quality. Prior {{studies have suggested that}} <b>reports</b> on internal <b>control</b> are an effective way for investors to evaluate the quality of the firm‟s internal control. By having a sound system of internal control, it creates reliance upon the firm‟s financial reporting. Therefore, the condition of internal control has direct connection to the investors‟ decision making.   In  U. S., where the corporate governance has been known to be typically rules-based, most researches have shown a positive relationship between internal <b>control</b> <b>reporting</b> and accounting quality. In the comply-or-explain reporting regime, there has only been one research as far as we know, that investigates the relationship between internal <b>control</b> <b>reporting</b> and accounting quality. The research took place in Netherlands; their study provided positive association between internal control  reporting quality and accounting quality, particularly earnings quality. The result is consistent with other research in rules-based regime.     The Swedish code has  been enacted for  five years and it is in the same regime as Netherlands. However, under current Swedish code, we are not aware of any empirical research  that  has taken place to address the effectiveness of the code. Therefore, we conducted the study with 152 firms listed on Swedish NASDAQ OMXS to test internal <b>control</b> <b>reporting</b> quality and accounting quality. We used proxies for internal <b>control</b> <b>reporting</b> quality: effectiveness statement of  internal <b>control,</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>reporting</b> score and internal control proportion. Simultaneously, we use discretionary accruals as a proxy of accounting quality. Our result showed a negative significant relationship between internal <b>control</b> <b>reporting</b> score and discretionary accruals but this relationship is quite weak and sensitive. It is broken with the presence of one more variable in regression, such as size variable. The result could not give any evidence for relationships between either effectiveness statements or extent of internal <b>control</b> <b>reporting</b> with discretionary accruals. Although, the relationship between internal <b>control</b> <b>reporting</b> score and discretionary accruals is not tight, it still encourage the  notion  that firms with good internal <b>control</b> <b>report</b> will improve their accounting quality. Our research contributes knowledge to wide-range of concerned parties. Moreover, it also suggests valuable ideas for further studies in the same area...|$|R

In October 1933, General Hugh S.

He wrote: [...] "Your last industrial control report is full of misinformation and sabotage of NRA. I encourage constructive criticism but your statements have been consistently without foundation in fact and in one case distinctly libelous." [...] True replied that he had twenty years of experience reporting and planned to continue attending. True was ejected when he tried to attend Johnson's next conference. In covering the dispute, the Chicago Tribune described Industrial <b>Control</b> <b>Reports</b> as [...] "a weekly business gossip letter".
