Millions of years would have passed since their departure, and in any case they would be millions of light years from Earth. However, they find the vacuum of intergalactic space insufficient for safety; they must instead travel to a region between superclusters of galaxies to make repairs. They do, but the extremely thinly spread matter is then too dispersed to use for deceleration. They must wait, flying free but essentially without the ability to change course, until they randomly encounter enough galactic matter to try to decelerate enough to search for habitable planets. To make the waiting time shorter, they continue accelerating through the first several galaxies they encounter, more and more closely approaching the speed of light with tau, or proper time, decreasing closer and closer to zero.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{management}} of resectable rectal cancer {{continues to be}} guided by clinical trials and advances in technique. Although surgical advances including total mesorectal excision continue to decrease rates of local recurrence, the {{management of}} locally advanced disease (T 3 -T 4 or N+) benefits from a multimodality approach including neoadjuvant <b>concomitant</b> chemotherapy and <b>radiation.</b> Circumferential resection margin, which can be determined preoperatively via MRI, is prognostic. Toxicity associated with radiation therapy is decreased by placing the patient in the prone position on a belly board, however for patients who cannot tolerate prone positioning, IMRT decreases the volume of normal tissue irradiated. The use of IMRT requires knowledge of the patterns of spreads and anatomy. Clinical trials demonstrate high variability in target delineation without specific guidance demonstrating the need for peer review {{and the use of}} a consensus atlas. <b>Concomitant</b> with <b>radiation,</b> fluorouracil based chemotherapy remains the standard, and although toxicity is decreased with continuous infusion fluorouracil, oral capecitabine is non-inferior to the continuous infusion regimen. Additional chemotherapeutic agents, including oxaliplatin, continue to be investigated, however currently should only be utilized on clinical trials as increased toxicity and no definitive benefit has been demonstrated in clinical trials.

40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is {{the most}} common and lethal of all gliomas. The current {{standard}} of care includes surgery followed by <b>concomitant</b> <b>radiation</b> and chemotherapy with the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). O 6 -methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) repairs the most cytotoxic of lesions generated by TMZ, O 6 -methylguanine. Methylation of the MGMT promoter in GBM correlates with increased therapeutic sensitivity to alkylating agent therapy. However, several aspects of TMZ sensitivity are not explained by MGMT promoter methylation. Here, we investigated our hypothesis that the base excision repair enzyme alkylpurine–DNA–N-glycosylase (APNG), which repairs the cytotoxic lesions N 3 -methyladenine and N 7 -methylguanine, may contribute to TMZ resistance. Silencing of APNG in established and primary TMZ-resistant GBM cell lines endogenously expressing MGMT and APNG attenuated repair of TMZ-induced DNA damage and enhanced apoptosis. Reintroducing expression of APNG in TMZ-sensitive GBM lines conferred resistance to TMZ in vitro and in orthotopic xenograft mouse models. In addition, resistance was enhanced with coexpression of MGMT. Evaluation of APNG protein levels in several clinical datasets demonstrated that in patients, high nuclear APNG expression correlated with poorer overall survival compared with patients lacking APNG expression. Loss of APNG expression in a subset of patients was also associated with increased APNG promoter methylation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that APNG contributes to TMZ resistance in GBM and may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease...|$|E

The primary endpoint was the rate of pathologic complete response. ResultsThis trial closed early because, during an interim analysis, the primary endpoint fell short. However, 26 eligible patients were accrued. Twenty (74 %) were men. Performance scores of 0, 1, and 2 were seen in 16 (59 %), 9 (33 %), and 2 (7 %), respectively. Among eligible patients, 6 of 26 (23 %; 95 % confidence interval 9 - 44 %) demonstrated a pathologic complete response. Twenty-two underwent a complete cancer resection.

40|$|The use of two {{different}} wavelength lasers in the nonlinear regime of the inverse Compton scattering interaction is proposed {{in order to provide}} a new strategy for controlling scattered photon energy distributions in the x-ray to γ-ray spectral region. In this nonlinear interaction, the component of the relativistic electron’s trajectory driven by a longer-wavelength laser with the normalized vector potential a_{L}∼ 1 is a large oscillatory figure- 8; in the proposed scenario a rapid small-amplitude oscillation induced by a shorter-wavelength laser is superimposed upon this figure- 8. Thus, the electron’s momentum is mainly supplied from longer-wavelength laser, while the high-frequency part of the acceleration is given by shorter-wavelength laser. In this way, the harmonics radiated at high frequency from the oscillating electron can be strongly modified by the nonlinear motion initiated by the low frequency, large a_{L} laser resulting in the generation of the harmonics with the photon energy of 4 γ^{ 2 }h̵(ω_{L,short}+nω_{L,long}).

40|$|Purpose Cisplatin {{concomitantly}} administered with radiotherapy {{is increasingly}} used in locally advanced {{head and neck}} squamous cell carcinoma. We aimed to compare the incidence of hearing loss between patients treated with intra- arterial high- dose cisplatin chemoradiation with sodium thiosulfate (CRT- IA) and intravenous high- dose cisplatin chemoradiation without sodium thiosulfate (CRT- IV). Patients and Methods We conducted a prospective analysis of hearing thresholds at low and (ultra-) high frequencies obtained before, during, and after treatment in 158 patients. Patients were randomly assigned for either CRT- IA (150 mg/ m(2), four courses) with sodium thiosulfate cisplatin neutralization or CRT- IV (100 mg/ m 2, three courses) without rescue. All patients received <b>concomitant</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy (RT; 70 Gy). Results CRT- IA resulted in approximately 10 % less hearing loss at frequencies vital for speech perception, compared with CRT- IV (P. 14). Age, cumulative cisplatin dose, cumulative RT dose, and the considered frequency area determine the degree of hearing loss (P <. 001). Cisplatin induced increasing hearing loss of 24 % to 60 % with increasing frequencies. RT induced hearing loss at speech frequencies of 9 % to 12 %. Conclusion Depending on the criteria used to assess hearing loss due to treatment, differences in ototoxicity between CRT- IA and CRT- IV were found in favor of CRT- IA. It is desirable to specify hearing loss criteria toward frequencies vital for speech perception, and to refine grading scales to reveal subtle and clinically relevant dissimilarities in ototoxicity between different treatment protocol...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} quality-of-life (QOL) {{aspects of}} an organ preservation intra-arterial chemotherapy and <b>concomitant</b> <b>radiation</b> protocol, RADPLAT. DESIGN: Nonrandomized phase 2 B feasibility trial. PATIENTS: Fifty consecutive patients with inoperable stage IV {{head and neck}} cancer. INTERVENTION: Supradose selective intra-arterial cisplatin and concomitant standard radiation (RADPLAT). MEASURES: Assessment with structured questionnaires before treatment and at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were available for QOL assessment at 1 year (the " 1 -year QOL" group), as 16 patients died, 5 needed salvage surgery, and 3 were not available for interview (the "failure" group). Twelve-month results were mainly based on the first group. The functional well-being and head and neck scales showed a statistically significant improvement over time (P <. 001). After 12 months, 21 patients (81 %) returned to an oral diet, while 5 patients still needed tube feeding. For 23 patients (88 %), the quality and strength of the voice {{was more or less}} normal. Of the 18 patients who were employed before their treatment, 10 were able to return to their job within 12 months. Xerostomia was reported by 17 patients (65 %). Further detailed analysis showed statistically significant differences in pretreatment scores between the 1 -year QOL group and the failure group, ie, physical well-being, functional well-being, and the head and neck scales (P <. 05). Differences in these groups with respect to sex, age, tumor site, or stage could not be found. CONCLUSION: Given that only patients with locally (anatomic or functional) inoperable stage IV disease were treated, the results are promising, underlining the feasibility of the RADPLAT protoco...|$|E
40|$|THYROID CANCER IS {{the most}} common {{malignant}} endocrine tumor. In areas not associated with nuclear fallout, the annual incidence ranges between 2. 0 – 3. 8 cases/ 100, 000 in women and 1. 2 – 2. 6 / 100, 000 in men (1). Because most patients present {{at an early stage}} of disease, a 10 -yr survival in about 80 % can be achieved after thyroidectomy and 131 I ablative therapy (2, 3). This implies that the prevalence of patients under surveillance for recurrent cancer is high with an estimated European population of patients and survivors of 200, 000 (4). The vast majority of thyroid cancers concerns differentiated (papillary and follicular) variants (DTC) with a relatively favorable prognosis. Suspicion of recurrence usually arises when the level of serum thyroglobulin (Tg; sensitivity, 91 %; specificity, 99 %) is rising (5, 6). In 10 – 15 % of these patients, a diagnostic 131 I whole body scintigraphy (WBS) is negative (5). Not uncommonly, blind 131 I therapies are given with variable efficacy and <b>concomitant</b> toxicities (<b>radiation</b> and hypothyroidism) (7). Moreover, increased TSH levels required for 131 I therapy may stimulate tumor growth (8, 9). Alternatively, positron emission tomography (PET) with [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (18 FDG) can document the recurrence, thereby rationalizing therapeutic options. Apart from the diagnostic relief that can be offered by First Published Online October 27, 200...|$|R
40|$|The {{integrin}} {{family of}} cell adhesion receptors {{is emerging as}} a promising target of anticancer therapy. AlphaVbeta 3 and alphaVbeta 5 integrins are overexpressed on both glioma cells and tumor vasculature. Cilengitide, the most advanced specific integrin inhibitor in oncology, has shown antitumor activity against glioma in early clinical trials. Durable remissions have been observed in phase I and phase II trials for recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) with both lower and higher doses of cilengitide. Pilot trials in newly diagnosed glioblastoma in conjunction with standard chemoradiotherapy have been encouraging. Preclinical data suggest synergy with <b>concomitant</b> chemo- and <b>radiation</b> therapy. A pivotal phase III study (CENTRIC) in newly diagnosed GBM patients is currently recruiting. This paper summarizes the current {{understanding of the role}} of integrins and their inhibition in gliomagenesis. The background and design of ongoing trials are outlined...|$|R
40|$|Choroid plexus {{carcinoma}} (CPC) is {{a malignant}} tumor {{with a strong}} tendency to spread along the cerebrospinal fluid pathway. There is no standardized chemotherapy protocol for this rare tumor. We report a 38 -year-old man with CPC in the lateral ventricle with obstructive hydrocephalus. Because of the poor demarcation between thalamus and fornix, subtotal tumor resection was performed. Postoperative spine magnetic resonance (MR) image revealed whole spinal axis dissemination. After diagnosis of CPC, the patient was treated with whole ventricular and spine <b>radiation</b> <b>concomitant</b> with temozolomide chemotherapy, although the O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter {{was found to be}} unmethylated. Although MR images revealed transient stable disease during adjuvant therapy, tumor progression was depicted after four cycles of temozolomide therapy. We discuss the ineffectiveness of adjuvant temozolomide therapy for CPC in connection with O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation. © 2011 The Japan Society of Brain Tumor Pathology...|$|R
