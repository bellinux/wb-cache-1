500|$|In 2004, Ross was {{supposed}} to begin the season in the minors for Detroit. However, with Detroit desperate for bullpen help, Ross {{was traded to the}} Los Angeles Dodgers on April 1 for relief pitcher Steve Colyer. He was assigned to the AAA Las Vegas 51s of the Pacific Coast League, where he was teammates with Jayson Werth and Shane Victorino, whom he went on to face in the 2010 National League Championship Series (NLCS). Injuries marred Ross's 2004 campaign; a knee injury kept him out for two weeks early in the season, he missed time from May 26 to July 15 after smashing his hand in a <b>car</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> breaking his finger, and he broke his wrist on August 25 which ended his season. In 60 games, he batted [...]273 with 65 hits, 17 doubles, 14 home runs, and 49 RBI. Ross spent most of 2005 with Las Vegas. From July 26 to August 11, he hit 10 home runs and had 25 RBI in 17 games.

500|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of November 8, Bundy approached 18-year-old telephone operator Carol DaRonch at Fashion Place Mall in Murray, Utah, {{less than a mile}} from the Midvale restaurant where Melissa Smith was last seen. He identified himself as [...] "Officer Roseland" [...] of the Murray Police Department, told DaRonch that someone had attempted to break into her car, and asked her to accompany him to the station to file a complaint. When DaRonch pointed out that Bundy was driving on a road that did not lead to the police station, he immediately pulled to the shoulder and attempted to handcuff her. During their struggle, he inadvertently fastened both handcuffs to the same wrist, and DaRonch was able to open the <b>car</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> escape. Later that evening, Debra Jean Kent, a 17-year-old student at Viewmont High School in Bountiful, [...] north of Murray, disappeared after leaving a theater production at the school to pick up her brother. The school's drama teacher and a student told police that [...] "a stranger" [...] had asked each of them to come out to the parking lot to identify a car. Another student later saw the same man pacing in the rear of the auditorium, and the drama teacher spotted him again shortly before the end of the play. Outside the auditorium, investigators found a key that unlocked the handcuffs removed from Carol DaRonch's wrist.|$|E

Oswald walked over to Tippit's car and apparently exchanged words with him through an open vent window. Tippit opened his <b>car</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> as he walked {{toward the front of}} the car, Oswald drew his handgun and fired four shots in rapid succession. One bullet hit Tippit in the chest, one in the stomach, another in his right temple (one bullet hit a button and did not penetrate his skin).

[...] Encinia orders her to [...] "get out of the car", and, when she repeatedly refuses to exit, he tells her she is under arrest. Bland repeatedly asks why she is under arrest, and Encinia responds, [...] "I am giving you a lawful order." [...] She refuses to leave her car, stating she is not under arrest as she is unaware of the reason and not obliged to. Encinia then opens her <b>car</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> tells her more than a dozen times {{to get out of the}} car before [...] he tries to pull her out. After struggling, he draws his Taser and points it at Bland, shouting [...] "I will light you up! Get out! Now!", at which point she exits her vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|Tatchell {{researched}} the Gukurahundi attacks in Matabeleland in the 1980s, when the Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade attacked {{supporters of the}} Zimbabwe African Peoples Union. He became convinced that Mugabe had broken international human rights law during the attack, which is estimated to have involved the massacre of around 20,000 civilians. Then in 1999, journalists Mark Chavunduka and Ray Choto were tortured by the Zimbabwe Army. The arrest of Augusto Pinochet in London seemed to him a precedent that human rights violations could be pursued against a head of state, thanks {{to the principle of}} universal jurisdiction. On 30 October 1999 Tatchell and three other OutRage! activists approached Mugabe's car in a London street and attempted to perform a citizen's arrest. Tatchell opened the <b>car</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> grabbed Mugabe. He then called the police. The four OutRage! activists were arrested, on charges including criminal damage, assault and breach of the peace; charges were dropped on the opening day of their trial. Mugabe responded by describing Tatchell and his OutRage! colleagues as [...] "gay gangsters", a slogan frequently repeated by his supporters, and claimed they had been sent by the United Kingdom government.|$|E

2500|$|Minutes {{after midnight}} on March 4, 1957, Kastner was shot as {{he arrived at}} his Tel Aviv home. The attack {{was carried out by}} a three-man squad from a group of {{veterans}} from the pre-state right-wing militia Lehi led by Yosef Menkes and Yaakov Heruti. Menkes had also {{been a member of the}} post-independence terrorist group Kingdom of Israel. The assassination squad consisted of Menkes (the leader), Ze'ev Eckstein (the shooter), and Dan Shemer (the driver). The three men had waited in a jeep parked outside Kastner's house. Eckstein disembarked and approached Kastner as he locked his car, and asked him if he was Rudolf Kastner. When Kastner confirmed, Eckstein pulled out a handgun and fired three times. The first shot was a spent bullet, the second hit the <b>car</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> the third hit Kastner in the upper body, critically wounding him. Kastner attempted to escape, but died of his injuries on March 15. In Gaylen Ross' 2008 film [...] "Killing Kasztner", Ze'ev Eckstein presented a very different sequence of events and implied that someone else fired a fatal third bullet.

2500|$|In October 2003, Travis {{escaped from}} the Herolds' car and held up traffic at a busy intersection, {{and was on the}} loose for several hours. [...] The {{incident}} began after a pedestrian threw something at the car that went through a partially open window and struck Travis while they were stopped at a traffic light. [...] Startled, Travis unbuckled his seat belt, opened the <b>car</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> chased the man, but did not catch him. [...] When police arrived, they lured the chimpanzee into the car several times only to have Travis let himself out of another door and occasionally chase the officers around the car. [...] The 2003 incident led to the passing of a Connecticut law prohibiting people from keeping primates weighing more than 50 pounds as pets and requiring owners of exotic pets to apply for a permit. The new law took effect in 2004, and as of Travis's death, no one in the state had applied to adopt a chimpanzee. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection did not enforce the law on the Herolds because they had owned 200-pound Travis for so long and because the DEP did not believe Travis posed a public safety risk.|$|E
