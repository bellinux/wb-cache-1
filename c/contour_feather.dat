2500|$|There are {{two basic}} types of feather: vaned {{feathers}} which cover {{the exterior of the}} body, and down feathers which are underneath the vaned feathers.

The remiges, or flight feathers of the wing, and rectrices, the flight feathers of the tail are the most important feathers for flight. A typical vaned feather features a main shaft, called the rachis. Fused to the rachis are a series of branches, or barbs; the barbs themselves are also branched and form the barbules. These barbules have minute hooks called barbicels for cross-attachment. Down feathers are fluffy because they lack barbicels, so the barbules float free of each other, allowing the down to trap air and provide excellent thermal insulation. At the base of the feather, the rachis expands to form the hollow tubular calamus (or quill) which inserts into a follicle in the skin. The basal part of the calamus is without vanes.

40|$|Background: The plumage {{of birds}} is {{important}} for flying, insulation and social communication. Contour feathers cover most of the avian body and among other functions they provide a critical insulation layer against heat loss. Feather structure and composition are known to vary among individuals, which in turn determines variation in the insulation properties of the feather. However, the extent and the proximate mechanisms underlying this variation remain unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed <b>contour</b> <b>feather</b> structure from two different great tit populations adapted to different winter regimes, one northern population in Oulu (Finland) and one southern population in Lund (Sweden). Great tits from the two populations differed significantly in feather structure. Birds from the northern population had a denser plumage but consisting of shorter feathers with a smaller proportion containing plumulaceous barbs, compared with conspecifics from the southern population. However, differences disappeared when birds originating from the two populations were raised and moulted in identical conditions in a common-garden experiment located in Oulu, under ad libitum nutritional conditions. All birds raised in the aviaries, including adult foster parents moulting in the same captive conditions, developed a similar feather structure. These feathers were {{different from that of}} wild birds in Oulu but similar to wild birds in Lund, the latter moulting in more benign conditions than those of Oulu.

5000|$|The word down {{comes from}} the Old Norse word dúnn, which had the same meaning as its modern equivalent. [...] The down feather is {{considered}} to be the [...] "simplest" [...] of all feather types. It has a short or vestigial rachis (shaft), few barbs, and barbules that lack hooks. [...] There are three types of down: natal down, body down and powder down. Natal down is the layer of down feathers that cover most birds {{at some point in their}} early development. Precocial nestlings are already covered with a layer of down when they hatch, while altricial nestlings develop their down layer within days or weeks of hatching. Megapode hatchlings are the sole exception; they are already covered with <b>contour</b> <b>feathers</b> when they hatch. [...] Body down is a layer of small, fluffy feathers that lie underneath the outer <b>contour</b> <b>feathers</b> on a bird's body.|$|R
40|$|Contour {{feathers}} cover {{most of the}} avian {{body and}} play critical roles in insulation, social communication, aerodynamics, and water repellency. Feather production is costly {{and the development of}} the optimum characteristics for each function may be constrained by limited resources or time, and possibly also lead to trade-offs among the different characteristics. Populations exposed to different environmental conditions may face different selective pressures, resulting in differences in feather structure and coloration, particularly in species with large geographical distributions. Three resident populations of great tit Parus major L. from different latitudes differed in feather structure and coloration. Individuals from the central population exhibited less dense and longer contour feathers, with a higher proportion of plumulaceous barbs than either northern or southern birds, which did not differ in their feather structure. Ultraviolet reflectance and brightness of the yellow of the contour feathers of the breast was higher for the southern than for the northern population. Birds with greener plumage (higher hue) had less dense but longer feathers, independently of the population of origin. Differences in feather structure across populations appear to be unrelated to the <b>contour</b> <b>feather</b> colour characteristics except for hue. Nutritional and time constraints during molt might explain the pattern of feather structure, whereas varying sexual selection pressure might underlie the coloration patterns observed. Our results suggest that different selective pressures or constraints shape <b>contour</b> <b>feather</b> traits in populations exposed to varying environmental conditions.

40|$|The {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx {{have been known}} for over 140 years, {{are the most important}} reason for its fame and avian status. Previous analyses have almost unanimously focused on the remiges and rectrices. Faint remains of what appears to be body <b>contour</b> <b>feathers</b> are, however, present in the Berlin specimen along the back, around the legs, and possibly anterior to the basal part of the neck. Although noted by numerous previous authors every reference to these feathers was anecdotal. Recent claims that body feathers were once present but were mechanically removed appear unsubstantiated. Rather, the Berlin Archaeopteryx has to this day the same regions more or less intact as depicted on early drawings. The present study reveals that the impressions are very different from preparation scratches, and are consistent with body feathers. The counterslab corrobo-rates this, and in several cases both raches and barbs can be made out. The preserved body {{feathers of}} the back and the legs evidently were considerably smaller than the flight feathers, and clearly pennaceous in nature. The state of preservation does not, however, permit secure inferences that these body feathers necessarily resembled body <b>contour</b> <b>feathers</b> on most extant volant birds, nor that such feathers were distributed all over the body, although this is one possible scenario. Alternatively, the feathers on the back and legs could have resembled more simple <b>contour</b> <b>feathers</b> with open vanes, present in, for instance, ratites.

Analyses of fossilized color-imparting melanosomes reveal that their dimensions were similar to those of non-penguin avian taxa and that the feathering may have been predominantly gray and reddish-brown.

40|$|Stable-hydrogen isotope ratios (deuterium:protium; δD) in {{feathers}} enable {{researchers to}} evaluate patterns of avian movement and {{to estimate the}} source areas of migratory birds. However, variation in feather δD remains inadequately described, thus confounding inferences of avian movement and origin. We assessed variation within a feather and among feathers within and between tracts in three species of immature raptors. Within <b>contour</b> <b>feathers,</b> measurements of δD increased from a distal section to an adjacent, proximal section; the magnitude of δD increase varied with raptor species. Furthermore, <b>contour</b> and flight <b>feathers</b> differed systematically in their δD content. Two explanations for intrafeather and intraindividual variation warrant further investigation: (1) hydrogen isotope fractionation associated with feather growth rate, and (2) the incorporation of temporal variation in environmental δD into growing feathers. We consider these explanations for raptors and passerines, which seemingly differ in the incorporation of deuterium into feathers. Additionally, corresponding sections of multiple <b>contour</b> <b>feathers</b> exhibited better measurement repeatability than multiple sections within a contour feather; the variability of multiple δD measurements within a feather tract (geometric SD: ± 3. 5 %) suggests that biological effects on the repeatability of δD measurements from concurrently grown feather material are difficult to distinguish from analytical effects. In most cases, intrafeather and intraindividual variation can be minimized by informed sample selection decisions, but both sources of variation must be considered when stable-hydrogen isotopes are used to infer the geographic origins of migrants, ascertain migratory connectivity, and facilitate avian conservation decisions...|$|R

Feathered non-avian dinosaurs have not yet been described from the Crato Member, even though there are suggestions of their presence in nearby basins. Our description of the three feathers from the Crato laminated limestone reveals that, despite the small sample size, they can be referred to coelurosaurian theropods. Moreover, based on comparisons with extant feather morphotypes they can be identified as one <b>contour</b> <b>feather</b> and two downy feathers.

40|$|We present {{experimental}} evidence for endogenous control of circannual rhythms in a long-distance migratory wader, the Knot Calidris canutus. Six individuals of the subspecies canutus were caught during northward migration whilst staging in France, and were held together under constant temperature and photoperiodic conditions (15 °C, LD 12 : 12) for 20 months. Rhythms of <b>contour</b> <b>feather</b> and flight feather moult and of body mass change persisted throughout the experiment in most birds, and showed two cycles over this period.

Desynchronisation between the rhythms of moult and mass change in the same individual occurred in some birds. The first cycle was delayed with respect to the natural schedule, while the second cycle had a duration of about a year on average. Since the second cycle was less well expressed than the first cycle in most birds, the endogenous rhythm is likely to be damped rather than self-sustained. The complexity of the annual changes in photoperiod experienced by transequatorial migrants like Knots calls for more extensive analysis to unravel the nature of the synchronisation of the endogenous circannual rhythm. ...|$|E

In turn, many ecological phenomena in the birds’ life patterns are directly {{dependent on the}} state of plumage (e. g., time of breeding, seasonal migration, roost flights). For the first time the quantitative characterization of six heron species' plumage were done as well as the description of powder down feathers. The adaptive features of feathers and various types of heron’s plumages were discussed. The structure of <b>contour</b> <b>feathers</b> of herons is related to the peculiarities of species life pattern. All the species have {{a relatively small number of}} <b>contour</b> <b>feathers,</b> despite their large body size. According to this index the herons are more similar to typical wading birds (gulls, sandpipers) than for waterfowl. The total number of heron feathers slightly increase in winter, because they are migratory species. Structure of <b>contour</b> <b>feathers</b> of herons corresponds to that of other waterbirds. The rod is not bent, the feathers are large, and the mounting angle to the surface of the body is little. The cores of abdominal feather fracts reduce heat transfer and can be regarded as an adaptation factor to aquatic environment. Buoyancy is provided by heron’s feathers insignificantly, in contrast to the typical waterfowl species. Significant subcutaneous fat stores are typical for herons in spring, autumn and winter, increased buoyancy and being the energy reserves provide thermoregulation in cold environment. Our data indicate weak adaptation of herons’ plumage to aquatic environments, but also confirm its insulating properties, which is prove the herons semi-aquatic rather than aquatic life patterns. Due to color of plumage some three groups of herons were considered: white, mottled and camouflaged. Coloration of second and third group performs a protective function.
