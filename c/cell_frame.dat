40|$|NASA has {{utilized}} the {{alkaline fuel cell}} technology to provide electrical power for manned launch vehicles such as Gemini, Apollo, and the Space Shuttle. The current Shuttle alkaline fuel cells are procured from UTC Fuel Cells, a United Technologies Company. The alkaline fuel cells are very reliable but the operating life is limited to 2600 hours due to voltage degradation of the individual cells. The main limiting factor {{in the life of}} the cells is corrosion of the cell's fiberglass/epoxy frame by the aqueous potassium hydroxide electrolyte. To reduce operating costs, the orbiter program office approved the Long Life Alkaline Fuel Cell (LLAFC) program as a shuttle upgrade in 1999 to increase the operating life of the fuel cell powerplant to 5000 hours. The LLAFC program incorporates improving the cell by extending the length of the corrosion path, which reduces the <b>cell</b> <b>frame</b> corrosion. UTCFC performed analysis to understand the fundamental mechanisms that drive the <b>cell</b> <b>frame</b> corrosion. The analysis indicated that the corrosion path started along the bond line between the cathode and the <b>cell</b> <b>frame.</b> Analysis also showed that the oxygen available at the cathode, the catalyst on the electrode, and the electrode substrate all supported or intensified the corrosion. The new cell design essentially doubled the corrosion path to mitigate the problem. A 10 -cell stack was tested for 5000 hours during the development phase of this program to verify improved cell performance. A complete 96 -cell stack was then tested for 5000 hours during the full manned-space qualification phase of this program. Additional upgrades to the powerplant under this program are: replacing the aluminum body in the pressure regulator with stainless steel to reduce corrosion, improving stack insulator plate with improved resistance to stress failure and improved temperature capability, and replacing separator plate elastomer seals with a more durable material and improved seal retention...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{algorithm}} incorporating two novel {{ideas is}} {{proposed to improve}} the time performance of the quad tree-based method for planning the shortest path from a given source to any given destination. One of the novel ideas is to combine the free quads. The strength of this idea {{lies in the fact}} that the quads after the total division isolate the free space from the obstacle space. The free quads, which are normally small in size, along the boundary of the obstacles, are combined to form larger free areas. The boundary of every free area is thought of being fenced by a sequence of unit free area <b>cells</b> called <b>frame</b> <b>cells.</b> The size of such a cell is a pixel. The free area together with the <b>frame</b> <b>cells</b> is called <b>framed</b> free space. Thus the entire free space, isolated from the obstacle space, is cognized through the <b>frame</b> <b>cells.</b> The other idea is the adoption of the philosophy of the rectilinear propagation of light rays to trace the shortest path and employ dynamic programming as design strategy to compute the optimal/shortest path through the cognized free area. In the framed free space, all the <b>frame</b> <b>cells</b> hold the information about the shortest distance from it to the source point, computed using the notion of rectilinear propagation of light. The shortest distance from a destination point to a source point is computed using this information. Since the quads are combined to form larger free areas, the number of framed free spaces considered for finding the shortest path is reduced. This in turn reduces the total number of <b>frame</b> <b>cells</b> cognizing the free space so that the total number of <b>frame</b> <b>cells</b> that take part in the computation of the shortest path are drastically reduced. The proposed algorithm works in a 2 D static environment with obstacles of any shape and practically unconstrained size of an autonomous vehicle. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

The combination on microstructure (microsegregation), mechanical properties {{and the relationship of}} heat treatment on the alloy were analyzed. For this purpose Mn-Ni-resist (4. 50 C, 2. 64 Si, 6. 0 Mn, 10 Ni) was melted and cast in the form of Y-block test pieces. Four different heat treatment procedures were applied to the as-cast to investigate the effect of alloy modifications on Mn-Ni-resist. Optical and scanning electron microscopies were used for microstructure investigation. To determine the mechanical properties tensile test and hardness test were carried out. The result indicates both composition and heat treatment affect the performance of Mn-Ni-resist intensively. Microprobe analysis shows some silicon segregation near the graphite and practically little segregation of manganese.

While these alloys offer significant advantages (e. g., low material and manufacturing cost, high thermal conductivity, and high temperature oxidation resistance), there are challenges which can hinder their utilization in SOFC systems; these challenges include Cr volatility and reactivity with glass seals. To overcome these challenges, protective coatings and surface treatments for the alloys are under development. In particular, aluminization of alloy surfaces offers the potential for mitigating both evaporation of Cr from the alloy surface and reaction of alloy constituents with glass seals. Commercial aluminization processes are available to SOFC developers, but they tend to be costly due to their use of exotic raw materials and/or processing conditions.

40|$|International audienceTracking {{of cells}} in live-imaging {{microscopy}} videos of epithelial sheets {{is a powerful}} tool for investigating fundamental processes in embryonic development. Characterizing cell growth, proliferation, intercalation and apoptosis in epithelia helps us to understand how morphogenetic processes such as tissue invagination and extension are locally regulated and controlled. Accurate cell tracking requires correctly resolving cells entering or leaving the field of view between <b>frames,</b> <b>cell</b> neighbour exchanges, cell removals and cell divisions. However, current tracking methods for epi-thelial sheets are not robust to large morphogenetic deformations and require significant manual interventions. Here, we present a novel algorithm for epithelial cell tracking, exploiting the graph-theoretic concept of a 'maxi-mum common subgraph' to track <b>cells</b> between <b>frames</b> of a video. Our algorithm does not require the adjustment of tissue-specific parameters, and scales in sub-quadratic time with tissue size. It does not rely on precise positional information, permitting large <b>cell</b> movements between <b>frames</b> and enabling tracking in datasets acquired at low temporal resolution due to experimental constraints such as phototoxicity.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{emerging}} interest in using ATM for wireless transmissions. Because ATM is primarily designed for a rather benign error free environment, in the wireless context the sources of errors and their consequences must be thoroughly understood. While this concern is valid in any network, it takes on a new more central role in the mobile wireless environment, where error bursts are expected to be a very significant source of degradation. These concerns motivate this study of the impact of errors on ATM cell transfer in the wireless environment. In this paper, we examine the impact of burst errors on the direct transfer of ATM cells taking into account the <b>cell</b> <b>framing</b> format. We examine the consequences of interleaving as well as the impact of fading.

40|$|The surface {{behaviour}} {{of swimming}} amoebae was followed in cells bearing a cAR 1 -paGFP (cyclic AMP receptor fused to a photoactivatable-GFP) construct. Sensitized amoebae {{were placed in}} a buoyant medium where they could swim toward a chemoattractant cAMP source. paGFP, activated at the cell's front, remained fairly stationary in the <b>cell's</b> <b>frame</b> as the <b>cell</b> advanced; the label was not swept rearwards. Similar experiments with chemotaxing cells attached to a substratum gave the same result. Furthermore, if the region around a lateral projection near a crawling cell's front is marked, the projection and the labelled cAR 1 behave differently. The label spreads by diffusion but otherwise remains stationary in the cell's frame; the lateral projection moves rearwards on the cell (remaining stationary {{with respect to the}} substrate), so that it ends up outside the labelled region. Furthermore, as cAR 1 -GFP cells move, they occasionally do so in a remarkably straight line; this suggests they do not need to snake to move on a substratum. Previously, we suggested that the surface membrane of a moving amoeba flows from front to rear as part of a polarised membrane trafficking cycle. This could explain how swimming amoebae are able to exert a force against the medium.

Virusinduced murine tumors stimulate both thymus-dependent and thymus-independent effector cells during different phases of tumor development (2, 3). However, injection of xenogeneic cells into the rat has been shown to raise a population of thymus-independent effector cells (4). In vitro lymphocytes from nonimmunized donors {{have been shown to be}} rendered cytotoxic in the presence of target cell-specific antibody (4, 5). The cells participating in this type of reaction appear to be members of the thymus-independent population.

Patients with transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder have been shown to possess cytotoxic effector cells in the blood, with specific reactivity for tumor cells of relevant origin (7 - 11).
