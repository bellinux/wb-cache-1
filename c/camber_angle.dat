5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on the front wheel, and its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip angle of the tire, the angle between the actual path of the tire and the direction it is pointing, and the <b>camber</b> <b>angle</b> of the tire (the angle that the tire leans from the vertical). The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|E
5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the <b>camber</b> <b>angle</b> of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E
5|$|The VT heralded the fitment of {{semi-trailing}} arm independent {{rear suspension}} as standard across the range, a significant selling point over the rival Falcon, along with increased electronics such as Traction Control. However, in terms of suspension, the original Opel design was simplified by removing the toe control links that was standard equipment on the European Omega since 1987. Consequently, this afflicted the VT with excessive tyre wear due to distortions to the suspension <b>camber</b> <b>angle</b> and toe under heavy load, such as heavy towing or when travelling over undulated surfaces.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBowed-twisted stators {{with large}} <b>camber</b> <b>angles</b> have been {{developed}} to replace the conventional tandem stators in an axial transonic fan stage working at high subsonic speeds. Experimental study is carried out on both stages with tandem stators and with bowed-twisted stators. Compared to the tandem stators, the bowed-twisted stators change the distribution of the low-energy fluid and the potential high-energy fluid at the compressor outlets, reduce the endwall loss significantly, improve the aerodynamic matching of rotors and stators, and eventually increase the fan stage performances. The aerodynamic performances of the fan stage at different operating points are compared and contrasted. The results show that the transonic fan stage with bowed-twisted stators has better aerodynamic performances. It is thus suggested that the bowed-twisted stators with large <b>camber</b> <b>angles</b> be popularized into the high-loaded transonic fan designs...|$|R

2500|$|The first-generation Corvair {{featured}} a rear engine + swing axle design {{similar to that}} of the Renault Dauphine and Volkswagen Beetle [...] a design which eliminates universal joints at the wheels and keeps the rear wheels perpendicular to the half-shafts. The design can allow rear tires to undergo large <b>camber</b> <b>angle</b> changes during fast cornering due to side g-forces causing [...] "rebound" [...] camber and decreasing the tread contact with the road surface, leading to a loss of rear wheel grip and oversteer—a dynamically unstable condition where a driver can lose control and spin. [...] The problem is most severe with rear-engine swing axle combinations because of the greater inertial mass over the rear wheels and the higher center of gravity during rebound camber conditions. [...] The additional high weight of a station wagon body also exacerbates the tendency. [...] Oversteer is exacerbated by deceleration during cornering due to increased side g-force and lightened load on rear tires (lift-off oversteer). Understeer is common in front-engine cars, due to more weight, and inertia, on the front tires. Both conditions are dangerous when a car is driven at its cornering limits.|$|E

The test bench allows performing normal pressure distribution and patch contact shape measurements on passenger car tires. The system is based on the use of a laterally illuminated glass on which the tire leans. Between them a plastic interphase is located that will cause the FTIR of light. A video camera catches the formed shining image through the glass. The brightness level in each pixel of the image can be related to the existing normal pressure.

50|$|Camber thrust is {{approximately}} linearly proportional to <b>camber</b> <b>angle</b> for small angles, reaches its steady-state value nearly instantaneously after {{a change in}} <b>camber</b> <b>angle,</b> and so {{does not have an}} associated relaxation length. Bias-ply tires have been found to generate more camber thrust than radial tires. Camber stiffness is a parameter used to describe the camber thrust generated by a tire and it is influenced by inflation pressure and normal load. The net camber thrust is usually in front of the center of the wheel and so generates a camber torque, twisting torque, or twisting moment. The orientation of this torque is such that it tends to steer a tire towards the direction that it is leaned. An alternate explanation for this torque is that {{the two sides of the}} contact patch are at different radii from the axle and so would travel forward at different rates unless constrained by friction with the pavement.|$|E

50|$|Many rigid {{models are}} now made with {{ultralight}} {{materials such as}} aircraft-grade aluminium and titanium, and wheelchairs of composite materials such as carbon-fibre have started to appear. Ultra lightweight rigid wheelchairs {{are commonly known as}} 'active user chairs' as they are ideally suited to independent use. Another innovation in rigid chair design is the installation of shock absorbers, such as Frog Legs, which cushion the bumps over which the chair rolls. These shock absorbers may be added to the front wheels, to the rear wheels, or both. Rigid chairs also have the option for their rear wheels to have a camber, or tilt, which angles the tops of the wheels in toward the chair. This allows for more mechanically efficient propulsion by the user and also makes it easier to hold a straight line while moving across a slope.
