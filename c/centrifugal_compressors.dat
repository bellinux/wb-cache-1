25|$|<b>Centrifugal</b> <b>compressors,</b> {{sometimes}} termed radial compressors, are a sub-class {{of dynamic}} axisymmetric work-absorbing turbomachinery.|$|E
25|$|A partial list of {{turbomachinery}} {{that may}} use {{one or more}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> within the machine are listed here.|$|E
25|$|Air-conditioning and {{refrigeration}} and HVAC: <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> {{quite often}} supply the compression in water chillers cycles. Because {{of the wide}} variety of vapor compression cycles (thermodynamic cycle, thermodynamics) and {{the wide variety of}} workings gases (refrigerants), <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> are used {{in a wide range of}} sizes and configurations. Use of real gas properties is needed to properly design, test and analyze the performance of these machines. Standards set by the industry for these compressors include ASHRAE, ASME & API.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{is to develop a}} method for {{modelling}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> surge in the presence of pressure pulsations in gas transmission lines, and examine the effects of pulsation amplitude and frequency on <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> operating stability. Anecdotal field evidence suggests that it is possible for a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> to enter surge when pressure pulsations are present, even in the case where the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> would otherwise operate at a stable point. In such a situation it has been concluded that the instability results from the pulsations. The method used for the model of the piping system is a finite element model of the pipe acoustics, with a reciprocating compressor model and a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> model as boundary conditions. The details of these models and the methods for coupling them are a large portion of this work. The combined <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> and piping acoustic model are used in a variety of numerical experiments investigating the effect of pulsation amplitude and frequency on the operating point of the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor.</b> The results of the numerical experiments show that piping system acoustic properties have a strong effect on pulsation amplitude, and pulsations have a strong effect on compressor operating point. The pulsations cause an oscillation in operating point away from the compressor?s steady state operating point. The effect is stronger as pulsation amplitude increases and as pulsation frequency approaches the natural frequency of the piping system. If the pulsations are strong enough, they can force the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> operating point over the surge limit, and then back into the stable operating region before the compressor enters a surge cycle. Numerical experiments show that the pulsations must push the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> over the surge limit and remain there long enough, if a surge cycle is to develop. Therefore, it is concluded that pulsations can cause a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> to cross the surge limit, and that larger pulsations will indeed cause surge when the operating point is across the surge limit for long enough...|$|R

25|$|The speed {{lines of}} gas turbine <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> {{typically}} exhibit choke. This {{is a situation}} where the pressure ratio of a speed line drops rapidly (vertically) with little or no change in flow. In most cases {{the reason for this is}} that close to Mach 1 velocities have been reached somewhere within the impeller and/or diffuser generating a rapid increase in losses. Higher pressure ratio turbocharger <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> exhibit this same phenomenon. Real choke phenomena is a function of compressibility as measured by the local Mach number within an area restriction within the centrifugal pressure stage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> are impractical, {{compared}} to axial compressors, {{for use in}} large gas turbine engines propelling large aircraft, due to the resulting weight and stress, and to the frontal area presented by the diffuser.|$|E
25|$|In gas {{turbines}} and auxiliary power units. Ref. Figures 4.1–4.2 In their simple form, modern {{gas turbines}} {{operate on the}} Brayton cycle. (ref Figure 5.1) Either or both axial and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> are used to provide compression. The types of gas turbines that most often include <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> include turboshaft, turboprop, auxiliary power units, and micro-turbines. The industry standards applied {{to all of the}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> used in aircraft applications are set by the FAA and the military to maximize both safety and durability under severe conditions. Centrifugal impellers used in gas turbines are commonly made from titanium alloy forgings. Their flow-path blades are commonly flank milled or point milled on 5-axis milling machines. When tolerances and clearances are the tightest, these designs are completed as hot operational geometry and deflected back into the cold geometry as required for manufacturing. This need arises from the impeller's deflections experienced from start-up to full speed/full temperature which can be 100 times larger than the expected hot running clearance of the impeller.|$|E

25|$|The inlet to a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressor</b> is {{typically}} a simple pipe.

25|$|With {{regard to}} the {{equation}} of state, {{it is important to}} remember that while air and nitrogen properties (near standard atmospheric conditions) are easily and accurately estimated by this simple relationship, there are many centrifugal compressor applications where the ideal relationship is inadequate. For example, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> used for large air conditioning systems (water chillers) use a refrigerant as a working gas that cannot be modeled as an ideal gas. Another example are <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> design and built for the petroleum industry. Most of the hydrocarbon gases such as methane and ethylene are best modeled as a real gas equation of state rather than ideal gases. The Wikipedia entry for equations of state is very thorough.|$|E
25|$|In {{pipeline}} compressors {{of natural}} gas to move the gas from the production site to the consumer. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> for such uses may be one- or multi-stage and driven by large gas turbines. Standards set by the industry (ANSI/API, ASME) result in large thick casings to maximize safety. The impellers are often if not always of the covered style which makes them look much like pump impellers. This type of compressor is also often termed an API-style. The power needed to drive these compressors is most often in the thousands of horsepower (HP). Use of real gas properties is needed to properly design, test and analyze the performance {{of natural gas}} pipeline <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many large snowmaking {{operations}} (like ski resorts) {{use this}} type of compressor.

25|$|Their main {{drawback}} {{is that they}} cannot achieve the high compression ratio of reciprocating compressors without multiple stages. There are few one-stage <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> capable of pressure ratios over 10:1, due to stress considerations which severely limit the compressor's safety, durability and life expectancy.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the {{internal}} gearbox {{is complicated by the}} heat and small space available in which to connect the driveshaft. It is usually placed between the compressor outlet and the combustor. In turboprops or designs with <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors,</b> it may be placed ahead of the compressor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> {{also look}} {{very similar to}} their {{turbomachinery}} counterpart the radial turbine {{as shown in the}} figure. While a compressor transfers energy into a flow to raise its pressure, a turbine operates in reverse, by extracting energy from a flow, thus reducing its pressure. In other words, power is input to compressors and output from turbines.|$|E

25|$|Axial flow {{compressors}} {{produce a}} continuous flow of compressed gas, {{and have the}} benefits of high efficiency and large mass flow rate, particularly {{in relation to their}} size and cross-section. They do, however, require several rows of airfoils to achieve a large pressure rise, making them complex and expensive relative to other designs (e.g. <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors).</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{weigh the}} {{advantages}} between <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> {{it is important}} to compare 8 parameters classic to turbomachinery. Specifically, pressure rise (p), flow (Q), angular speed (N), power (P), density (ρ), diameter (D), viscosity (μ) and elasticity (e). This creates a practical problem when trying to experimentally determine the effect of any one parameter. This is because it is nearly impossible to change one of these parameters independently.|$|E
25|$|Diagonal or {{mixed-flow}} compressors {{are similar}} to <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors,</b> but have a radial and axial velocity component {{at the exit from}} the rotor. The diffuser is often used to turn diagonal flow to an axial rather than radial direction. Comparative to the conventional centrifugal compressor (of the same stage pressure ratio), the value of the speed of the mixed flow compressor is 1.5 times larger.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors,</b> {{commercial}} designs currently do not exceed a compression ratio {{of more than a}} 3.5 to 1 in any one stage (for a typical gas). Since compression raises the temperature, the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal. The inter-stage coolers typically result in some partial condensation that is removed in vapor-liquid separators.|$|E
25|$|For {{purposes}} of generalization and definition, {{it can be}} said that <b>centrifugal</b> <b>compressors</b> often have density increases greater than 5 percent. Also, they often experience relative fluid velocities above Mach number 0.3 when the working fluid is air or nitrogen. In contrast, fans or blowers are often considered to have density increases of less than five percent and peak relative fluid velocities below Mach 0.3.|$|E

Standards set by the industry for turbochargers may have been established by SAE. Ideal gas properties often work well for the design, test and analysis of turbocharger centrifugal compressor performance.|$|E
