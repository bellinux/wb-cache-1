5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk of stars in an eccentric orbit around the central black hole. The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital apocenter, creating a concentration of stars. P2 also contains a <b>compact</b> <b>disk</b> of hot, spectral class A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.|$|E

These systems charged for access, typically a flat monthly fee, compared to the per-hour fees charged by Event Horizons BBS and most online services.

Early 1990s editions of Boardwatch were filled with ads for single-click install solutions dedicated to these new sysops.
