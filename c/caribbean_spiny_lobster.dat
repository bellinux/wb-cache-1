The use of {{mangrove}} prop {{roots and}} associated coralline habitats by <b>Caribbean</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> was investigated near {{two types of}} mangrove islands in Belize. <b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> sheltered among mangrove prop roots, in undercut peat banks and under corals near islands, and they ranged in size from newly recruited juveniles to subadults. Lobsters prefened to shelter under large stony corals, but their use of mangrove prop roots nd undercut peat banks increased when the density of corals was low. Den residence time and distance moved within a site were similar at islands isolated by deep water channels and islands separated by shallow seagrass beds, but {{as a consequence of}} high immigration rates, population sizes were highest near shallow islands. Predation on newly settled juveniles was greater in seagrass and coral crevices than in mangrove prop roots, whereas the survival of largerjuveniles was higher in mangroves and coral patch reefs than in seagrass. These results suggest that mangrove habitats may function as a nursery for juvenile <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> but that the use of this habitat depends on shelter characteristics and the isolation of islands...|$|R

Deterministic economic modeling revealed a modest cost to lobster fishers who take time to kill lionfish or work more slowly to avoid their venomous spines. However, this cost exacerbated the negative effects of variation in other components of the fishery, such as lobster price, time taken to gather lobsters, and amount harvested at each condo.

Sequence variation in the viral DNA fragment was high, with 61 unique alleles identified from 9 areas.

30|$|Some {{studies have}} {{discussed}} the relationship between addition of population {{and changes in the}} barcoding gap (Lukhtanov et al., 2009; Naro-Maciel et al., 2011). In a study on butterfly species from Central Asia, Lukhtanov et al. (2009) discussed how the inclusion of geographically separated populations influenced DNA barcoding. They concluded that when NJ clustering is used, the move from local to geographically dispersed sampling does not seriously reduce the ability of DNA barcoding to delineate species. Although the expansion of geographical sampling significantly increased intraspecific variation, the data from Lukhtanov et al. (2009) indicated that instances of discovering populations with shared barcodes are uncommon. Naro-Maciel et al. (2011) analyzed divergent lineages observed within <b>Caribbean</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> to investigate population differentiation, and found that although intraspecific divergence may have been underestimated in some cases due to smaller sample sizes, there was no significant correlation between sample size and mean intraspecific divergence. They mentioned that the clear barcode gap between intra- and interspecific divergences suggested that increasing the sample size would not significantly change the effectiveness of species identification through DNA barcoding.|$|R
40|$|Chemical senses play a {{critical}} role in predator-prey and social interactions of many animals. Predators often evoke adaptive escape responses by prey, one of which is the release of chemicals that induce adaptive avoidance behaviors from both predators and conspecifics. I explore the use of chemicals in predator-prey and social interactions, using a crustacean model system, the <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster.</b> 	As predators, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> are opportunistic, polyphagous feeders, and they rely heavily on their chemical senses during feeding. Some of their potential prey deter attacks through chemical defenses that act through the spiny lobsters’ chemical senses. An example of this is sea hares, Aplysia californica, which secrete an ink when vigorously attacked by sympatric <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters,</b> Panulirus interruptus. I show that that this ink defends sea hares from <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> through several mechanisms that include phagomimicry, sensory disruption, and deterrence, and that the ink’s efficacy is enhanced by its naturally high acidity. As prey, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> rely heavily on their chemical senses to assess risk from predators. One way to assess risk of predation is through ‘alarm cues’, which are injury-related chemicals. I show that injured <b>Caribbean</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters,</b> Panulirus argus, release alarm cues in their hemolymph, and that nearby conspecifics detect these cues using olfaction. Hemolymph from conspecifics induces primarily alarm behavior in the form of retreat, sheltering, and suppression of appetitive responses. In contrast, hemolymph from heterospecifics, depending on phylogenetic relatedness, induces either mixed alarm and appetitive behaviors or primarily appetitive behaviors. <b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> also use chemical cues to assess risk during social interactions with conspecific. I show that <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> use urine-borne chemical signals and agonistic behaviors to communicate social status and that these chemical signals are detected exclusively by the olfactory pathway. Dominant animals increase urine release during social interactions, whereas subordinates do not. Experimental prevention of urine release during interactions causes an increase in agonism, but this increase is abolished when urine of dominants is reintroduced. My findings lay the foundation for neuroethological studies of risk-assessment systems mediated by intraspecific chemical cues...|$|R

However, casitas may func-tion as an ecological trap for juvenile lobsters if they are attracted to casitas and their growth ormortality is poorer comparedwith natural shelters.

We compared the nutritional condition, relativemortality, and activity of lobsters of various sizes in casitas andnatural shelters in adult and juvenile lobster-dominatedhabitats in the FloridaKeys (United States). We found that the ecological effects of casitas are complex and location-dependent. Lobsters collected fromcasitas andnatural shelters {{did not differ in}} nutritional condition. However, juvenile lobsters in casitas experienced higher rates ofmortality than did individuals in natural shelters; themortality of large lobsters did not differ between casitas and natural shelters.

40|$|Sociality {{has evolved}} {{in a wide}} range of animal taxa but {{infectious}} diseases spread rapidly in populations of aggregated individuals, potentially negating the advantages of their social interactions. To disengage from the coevolutionary struggle with pathogens, some hosts have evolved various forms of "behavioral immunity"; yet, the effectiveness of such behaviors in controlling epizootics in the wild is untested. Here we show how one form of behavioral immunity (i. e., the aversion of diseased conspecifics) practiced by <b>Caribbean</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> (Panulirus argus) when subject to the socially transmitted PaV 1 virus, appears to have prevented an epizootic over a large seascape. We capitalized on a "natural experiment" in which a die-off of sponges in the Florida Keys (USA) resulted in a loss of shelters for juvenile lobsters over a ~ 2500 km 2 region. Lobsters were thus concentrated in the few remaining shelters, presumably increasing their exposure to the contagious virus. Despite this spatial reorganization of the population, viral prevalence in lobsters remained unchanged after the sponge die-off and for years thereafter. A field experiment in which we introduced either a healthy or PaV 1 -infected lobster into lobster aggregations in natural dens confirmed that <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> practice behavioral immunity. Healthy lobsters vacated dens occupied by PaV 1 -infected lobsters despite the scarcity of alternative shelters and the higher risk of predation they faced when searching for a new den. Simulations from a spatially-explicit, individual-based model confirmed our empirical results, demonstrating the efficacy of behavioral immunity in preventing epizootics in this system...|$|R
40|$|<b>Caribbean</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> {{have been}} {{harvested}} in Floridafor over 100 {{years and have}} been one of the state’s most valuable commercial fishery and perhaps the most intensive recreational fishery of any lobster species; however, landings and lobster population abundance declined beginning in 2000. The goal of the study was to review the life history and ecology of Panulirus argus inFlorida and assess potential population enhancement strategies for each stage. The study was conducted through a search of scientific literature, unpublished reports, popular books and personal communications. Potential population enhancement methods with respect to the Panulirus argus’s life history that were examined include larvae aquaculture and seeding, pueruli aquaculture or capture with seeding as well as protection of pueruli habitat, algal-phase juvenile habitat protection and habitat augmentation, post-algal juvenile habitat protection and habitat augmentation as well as growout of pueruli to latter stage juveniles for seeding, and sub-legal and legal size lobster habitat protection and habitat augmentation. Of these, two options seem most viable, 1) protection and augmentation of sponge and coral species that comprise juvenile lobster habitat or the utilization of artificial habitats to increase the number of size-appropriate shelters and 2) aquaculture of lobsters or growout of wild-caught pueruli to latter stage juveniles for subsequent seeding. Increased habitat would likely increase habitat carrying capacity and decrease lobster mortality by predation. Growout and seeding would also reduce predation on lobsters by by-passing the high mortality of small lobsters during that portion of their life cycle. Potential population enhancement could also be achieved by revisingFlorida’s lobster fishing regulations. Regulations need to better address the high mortality of sub-legal size lobsters used as attractants for “baiting” traps, a minimum size limit below the size of maturity, landing quotas or lack thereof that allows 90 % of legal-size lobsters to be taken each year and a harvesting season that allows the disturbance of ovigerous females. Of these fishery regulations, elimination of the existing fishery practice of “baiting”, increasing the minimum size limit, and enacting landing quotas seem to have the most potential to enhance Florida’s <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> population. Decreased mortality of undersized lobsters and an increase in the size of harvested lobsters would also help restoreFlorida’s historic lobster population size structure and the number of lobsters spawning each year. The findings of this study suggest that there are several viable methods to enhanceFlorida’sCaribbean <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> population to provide for both sustained fishery landings and improved lobster population abundance...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Caribbean</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> Panulirus argus, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} fisheries commodities in the Central American region, directly employing 50, 000 people and generating >US$ 450 million per year [1]. This industry is particularly important to small island states such as The Bahamas, which exports more lobster than any other country in the region [1]. Several factors contribute to this disproportionally high productivity, principally the extensive shallow-water banks covered in seagrass meadows [2], where fishermen deploy artificial shelters for the lobsters to supplement scarce reef habitat [3]. The surrounding seabed communities are dominated by lucinid bivalve mollusks that live among the seagrass root system [4 and 5]. These clams host chemoautotrophic bacterial symbionts in their gills that synthesize organic matter using reduced sulfur compounds, providing nutrition to their hosts [6]. Recent studies have highlighted the important role of the lucinid clam symbiosis in maintaining the health and productivity of seagrass ecosystems [7 and 8], but their biomass also represents a potentially abundant, but as yet unquantified, food source to benthic predators [9]. Here we undertake the first analysis of <b>Caribbean</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> diet using a stable isotope approach (carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur) and show that a significant portion of their food (∼ 20 % on average) is obtained from chemosynthetic primary production in the form of lucinid clams.

Five quantitative trophic models were constructed using Ecopath with Ecosim. The results show that, in terms of biomass, benthic autotrophs are the dominant group in all communities. Ecosystem Network Analysis indices showed that Cueva de Tiburones was the most mature, developed, complex and healthy subsystem, but, El Colorado and La Baliza were the subsystems most resistant to disturbances. The fisheries mainly concentrate on primary (La Baliza and Cueva de Tiburones sites) and secondary consumers (La Caldera, Chancay, and El Colorado). The greatest propagation of direct and indirect effects, estimated by Mixed Trophic Impacts and Ecosim simulations, were generated by the benthic autotrophs, small benthic epifauna, benthic-pelagic carnivorous fish and benthic carnivorous fish, among others. In contrast, the System Recovery Time showed different patterns among subsystems, indicating several compartments that reduce resilience. Considering the structure, dynamics, trophic functioning and ecosystem health of Banco Chinchorro, its ecological heterogeneity highlights the need for the design of a specific (by subsystem) management strategy, particularly because different species or functional groups present greater sensitivity to human interventions in each community...|$|R
