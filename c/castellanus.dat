5|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus <b>castellanus,</b> fibratus, spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and duplicatus. Cirrus <b>castellanus</b> is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. Cirrus fibratus looks striated and {{is the most common}} cirrus species. Cirrus uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare's tails. Of the varieties, Cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and cirrus radiatus has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky. Kelvin–Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E
5|$|A {{stratocumulus}} cloud {{is another}} type of a cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud. Like cumulus clouds, they form at low levels and via convection. However, unlike cumulus clouds, their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion. As a result, they flatten out like stratus clouds, giving them a layered appearance. These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the earth's oceans and twelve percent of the earth's continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, stratocumulus clouds reflect {{a large amount of}} the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. Stratocumulus clouds can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing. Being a cloud of limited convection, stratocumulus is divided into three species; stratiformis, lenticularis, and <b>castellanus,</b> that are common to the higher stratocumuliform genus-types.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus <b>castellanus,</b> there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, <b>castellanus,</b> and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E

500|$|Cirrus <b>Castellanus</b> {{is derived}} from Latin, which means [...] "castle" [...] or round turrets. They {{indicate}} that atmospheric instability is occurring on the higher altitudes of the troposphere. They appear as tall clouds that originate from a flat base.|$|E
2500|$|These {{species are}} subdivisions of genus types {{that occur in}} partly {{unstable}} air. The species <b>castellanus</b> appears when a mostly stable stratocumuliform or cirriform layer becomes disturbed by localized areas of airmass instability, usually {{in the morning or}} afternoon. This results in the formation of cumuliform buildups arising from a common stratiform base. <b>Castellanus</b> resembles the turrets of a castle when viewed from the side, and can be found with stratocumuliform genera at any tropospheric altitude level and with limited-convective patches of high-level cirrus. Tufted clouds of the more detached floccus species are subdivisions of genus-types which may be cirriform or stratocumuliform in overall structure. They are sometimes seen with cirrus, and with tufted cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus. [...] Low and mid level <b>castellanus</b> or floccus can resemble cumulo- and cumulonimbogenitus formations (see 'Mother clouds' section). [...] However, the latter genitus types are seen mostly in the evening and are the result of cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds dissipating rather than forming or building.|$|E
2500|$|Another variety, {{duplicatus}} (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species, and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis. [...] The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus. [...] It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. [...] It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis, <b>castellanus,</b> and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and <b>castellanus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|These {{are mostly}} fibrous wisps of {{delicate}} white cirriform ice crystal cloud that show up clearly {{against the blue}} sky.

They often form along a high altitude jetstream {{and at the very}} leading edge of a frontal or low-pressure disturbance where they may merge into cirrostratus. [...] These high clouds do not produce precipitation.|$|E

50|$|It is a cloud species {{attached}} to the cloud genera cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus and stratocumulus. Species of the clouds include cirrus <b>castellanus,</b> cirrocumulus <b>castellanus,</b> altocumulus <b>castellanus</b> and stratocumulus <b>castellanus.</b> Sometimes cumulus <b>castellanus</b> are referred to, but the type is not recognised by the France's national meteorological service Météo-France, or by the American Meteorological Society and World Meteorological Organisation. Those clouds some would classify as cumulus <b>castellanus</b> typically {{do not have a}} common base and are not arranged in a line, thus differing to some extent from the more universally-recognised <b>castellanus</b> types. Some scientists also think that the <b>castellanus</b> should be a full cloud genus, and not just a cloud species. The Federal Aviation Administration implicitly considers a <b>castellanus</b> as a full cloud genus.|$|E
50|$|However, {{although}} the species <b>castellanus</b> applies to different genera of convective clouds at different levels, {{the most current}} cloud type is the altocumulus <b>castellanus,</b> the base of {{which is in the}} medium level. This is reinforced by the fact that pilot's manuals interchangeably talk about either <b>castellanus</b> or altocumulus <b>castellanus,</b> restricting {{the meaning of the word}} catellanus.|$|E

50|$|Cumulus <b>castellanus</b> (from Latin <b>castellanus,</b> castle) {{is a type}} of cumulus {{cloud that}} is {{distinctive}} because it displays multiple towers arising from its top, indicating significant vertical air movement. They are so named because they somewhat resemble the crenellation on medieval castles. Cumulus <b>castellanus</b> clouds are associated with the formation of towering cumulus or cumulonimbus clouds, and correspondingly can be an indicator of forthcoming showers and thunderstorms. The World Meteorological Organization and the American Meteorological Society do not recognize cumulus <b>castellanus</b> as a distinct species, but instead classify all towering cumulus clouds as Cumulus congestus.|$|E
5000|$|Cirrocumulus <b>castellanus</b> {{is a type}} of {{cirrocumulus}} cloud. The name cirrocumulus <b>castellanus</b> {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "of a castle". These clouds appear as round turrets that are rising from either a lowered line or sheet of clouds. Cirrocumulus <b>castellanus</b> is an indicator of atmospheric instability {{at the level of the}} cloud. The clouds form when condensation occurs in the base cloud, causing latent heating to occur. This causes air to rise from the base cloud, and if the air ascends into conditionally unstable air, cirrocumulus <b>castellanus</b> will form.|$|E
5000|$|Altocumulus <b>Castellanus</b> {{clouds are}} {{typically}} accompanied by moderate turbulence {{as well as}} potential icing conditions. For these reasons, flight through Altocumulus <b>Castellanus</b> clouds is often best avoided by aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Stratocumulus <b>Castellanus</b> have {{stronger}} convective activity due to {{the presence}} of increasingly unstable air. They are distinct from other stratocumulus by puffy tower-like formations atop the cloud layer. They look like cumulus congestus, but can be easily confused: [...] "towers" [...] of cumulus congestus grow above separate clouds, whereas in the case of stratocumulus <b>castellanus,</b> there is always a more or less defined layer of clouds. Stratocumulus <b>castellanus</b> may develop into cumulus congestus (and even further into cumulonimbus) under auspicious conditions. Any showers from stratocumulus <b>castellanus</b> are not usually as heavy as those from cumulus congestus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Castellanus</b> (clouds made of {{very narrow}} columns) are notoriousas being {{unusable}} by glider pilots. In {{order for a}} cloud to have a usable thermal, the updraft column needs to exist under the cloud, {{in which case the}} cloud will have a flat base. An altocumulus <b>castellanus,</b> however, can be identified by the lack of a well-defined base. As said above, a hybrid cloud between cumulus and <b>castellanus</b> can be used by a glider pilot.|$|E
50|$|<b>Castellanus</b> {{clouds are}} {{evidence}} of mid-atmospheric instability {{and a high}} mid-altitude lapse rate. They may be a harbinger of heavy showers and thunderstorms and, if surface-based convection can connect to the mid-tropospheric unstable layer, continued development of <b>Castellanus</b> clouds can produce cumulonimbus clouds.|$|E
50|$|A <b>castellanus</b> (or castellatus) (from latin <b>castellanus,</b> castle) is a {{cloud that}} {{displays}} {{at least in}} its upper part cumuliform protuberances having the shape of turrets that give a crenellated aspect. Some of these turrets are higher than they are wide; they have a common base and seem to be arranged in a line. The <b>castellanus</b> characteristic is particularly obvious when the clouds are observed from the side (i.e., from a vantage point on a line perpendicular {{to the line of}} orientation).|$|E

50|$|Cirrus <b>castellanus</b> is {{a species}} of cirrus cloud. Its name comes from the word <b>castellanus,</b> which means of a fort, of a castle in Latin. Like all cirrus, this species occurs at high altitudes. It appears as {{separate}} turrets rising from a lower-level cloud base. Often these cloud turrets form in lines, {{and they can be}} taller than they are wide. This cloud species is usually dense in formation.|$|E
50|$|The species <b>castellanus</b> {{is defined}} in the International Cloud Atlas, which had its last {{official}} release in 1975. It is based on ground visual observation of cloud shape. In practice, {{the shape of a}} <b>castellanus</b> is related to the physical process producing it: local instability (or conditional instability) {{at the top of the}} cloud that breaks the temperature inversion and is the cause of the formation of towers, this being confirmed by vertical soundings.|$|E
5000|$|Pattern-based varieties: Radiatus (arranged in {{parallel}} bands) is sometimes {{seen with the}} stratformis and <b>castellanus</b> species. Altocumulus stratiformis radiatus of any opacity is coded CM5 if it is increasing in amount. The duplicatus or undulatus varieties are occasionally seen with the stratiformis and lenticularis species. [...] Altocumulus stratiformis duplicatus is coded CM7 {{if it is not}} overridden by another coding of higher importance. Lacunosus is very occasionally associated with altocumulus of the species stratiformis, <b>castellanus,</b> or floccus.|$|E
50|$|Châtelain (Med. Lat. <b>castellanus,</b> from castellum, a castle) was {{originally}} merely the French {{equivalent of the}} English castellan, i.e. the commander of a castle.|$|E
5000|$|Cirrocumulus floccus {{is a type}} of {{cirrocumulus}} cloud. The name cirrocumulus floccus {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "a lock of wool". Cirrocumulus floccus appears as small tufts of cloud with rounded heads, but ragged bottoms. The cloud can produce virga, precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground. Like cirrocumulus <b>castellanus,</b> cirrocumulus floccus is an indicator of atmospheric instability {{at the level of the}} cloud. In fact, cirrocumulus floccus can form from cirrocumulus <b>castellanus,</b> being the evolutionary state after the base of the original cloud has dissipated.|$|E
50|$|Partly {{unstable}}These {{species are}} subdivisions of genus types {{that occur in}} partly unstable air. The species <b>castellanus</b> appears when a mostly stable stratocumuliform or cirriform layer becomes disturbed by localized areas of airmass instability, usually {{in the morning or}} afternoon. This results in the formation of cumuliform buildups arising from a common stratiform base. <b>Castellanus</b> resembles the turrets of a castle when viewed from the side, and can be found with stratocumuliform genera at any tropospheric altitude level and with limited-convective patches of high-level cirrus. Tufted clouds of the more detached floccus species are subdivisions of genus-types which may be cirriform or stratocumuliform in overall structure. They are sometimes seen with cirrus, and with tufted cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus. Low and mid level <b>castellanus</b> or floccus can resemble cumulo- and cumulonimbogenitus formations (see 'Mother clouds' section). However, the latter genitus types are seen mostly in the evening and are the result of cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds dissipating rather than forming or building.|$|E
50|$|The {{title is}} {{originally}} {{equivalent to that}} of castellan (<b>castellanus)</b> or French châtelain; meaning keeper or commander of a castle and/or fortified settlement (both can be called Burg in German).|$|E
5000|$|The {{appearance}} of Altocumulus <b>Castellanus</b> early {{in a sunny}} day may indicate a high probability the formation of thunderstorms in the afternoon, as they may develop into cumulonimbus storm clouds.|$|E
5000|$|Species: Cirrocumulus {{stratiformis}} (Cc str) {{is one of}} four {{species and}} appears in the form of relatively flat stratocumuliform sheets or patches. The species lenticularis (Cc len) takes its name from the lens-shaped structure of this cloud which is tapered at each end. Cirrocumulus <b>castellanus</b> (Cc cas) has cumuliform buildups that give the cloud a partly or mainly turreted appearance. When the cumuliform parts have more of a tufted appearance, it is given the species name floccus (Cc flo). [...] Cirrocumulus with <b>castellanus</b> buildups can show some vertical extent, but are not usually classified as vertical or multi-étage clouds.|$|E
50|$|The first {{written record}} of the town dates back to 1314 under the name Lipva. In 1324 the {{settlement}} was mentioned as <b>castellanus</b> de Lypua, a place-name that reflects its reinforced character of that time.|$|E
50|$|Opacity-based varieties: Altocumulus {{stratiformis}} {{has three}} opacity-based varieties; Translucidus (CM3), perlucidus (CM3 or 7 depending on predominant opacity), and opacus (CM7). Varieties based on opacity are not commonly associatied with the species lenticularis, <b>castellanus,</b> or floccus.|$|E
50|$|To {{alleviate}} this confusion, scientists Richard S. Scorer and Corfidi {{propose a}} cloud classification {{based only on}} physical criteria obtained from vertical soundings and observations from meteorological satellites to reclassify the <b>castellanus</b> as a cloud genus {{at the same level}} as a cumulus or a cirrus. Corfidi has long criticised the resistance from official bodies to this change. However, the 2016 version of the International Cloud Atlas will not change the status of the <b>castellanus.</b> The same scientists have a similar opinion about lenticular clouds that can exist at different levels that are not recognised as a full cloud genus but only as a species.|$|E
