500|$|A {{week after}} The Washington Post {{released}} their report, Julia Pierson, {{who took over}} {{as director of the}} Secret Service from Sullivan in March 2013, testified at a United States House of Representatives hearing regarding security breaches at the White House. Pierson was criticised by Committee Chairman Darrell Issa regarding several security breaches. Issa stated, [...] "The fact is, the system broke down... when Oscar Ortega-Hernandez successfully shot at the White House on November 2011." [...] Upon hearing that an agent was unwilling to doubt her superior's assertion, Representative Elijah Cummings stated to Pierson that it was [...] "very disturbing to know that Secret Service agents in the most protective agency in the world feel more comfortable... coming to members of this committee and telling things than <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and members in the agency." [...] Pierson acknowledged that the incident was [...] "extremely" [...] troubling. As a result of the 2011 shooting and other controversies, Pierson resigned from her position on October 1, 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Nkrumah {{read books}} about {{politics}} and divinity, and tutored students in philosophy. In 1943 Nkrumah met Trinidadian Marxist C. L. R. James, Russian expatriate Raya Dunayevskaya, and Chinese-American Grace Lee Boggs, {{all of whom were}} members of an American-based Trotskyist intellectual cohort. Nkrumah later credited James with teaching him [...] "how an underground movement worked." [...] Federal Bureau of Investigation files on Nkrumah, kept from January to May 1945, identify him as a possible communist. Nkrumah was determined to go to London, wanting to continue his education there now that the Second World War had ended. James, in a 1945 letter introducing Nkrumah to Trinidad-born George Padmore in London, wrote: [...] "This young man is <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> He is not very bright, but nevertheless do what you can for him because he's determined to throw Europeans out of Africa." ...|$|E
