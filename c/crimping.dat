5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} leaf midge {{can cause}} browning, <b>crimping</b> and distortion of leaves at {{the tips of}} shoots but it is seldom a serious problem. The blackcurrant sawfly (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs {{on the underside of}} the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and earwigs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. PET/PTT {{conjugate}} yarn has a three-dimension spiral and permanent <b>crimp,</b> which endow the yarn and loomage with excellent performances of <b>crimp</b> extension and <b>crimp</b> recovery. The residual deformation and internal {{stress of the}} self-crimp yarn can be eliminated after the moist heat treatment, {{in order to develop}} the favorable <b>crimp</b> extension and <b>crimp</b> recovery of the self-crimp yarn, and to give the loomage soft handle and good dimension stability. <b>Crimp</b> shrinkage, <b>crimp</b> module, etc, of the different types of PET/PTT yarn, were tested, and the axial morphology of the yarn was observed, to investigate the effect of linear density, moist heat temperature on PET/PTT yarn...|$|R

25|$|Demand for {{manpower}} to keep ships sailing to Alaska and the Klondike kept <b>crimping</b> a {{real danger}} into the early 20th century, but the practice was finally ended {{by a series of}} legislative reforms that spanned almost 50 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} steampowered {{vessels in the}} world's merchant marine services {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries radically altered the economics of seafaring. Without acres of canvas to be furled and unfurled, the demand for unskilled labor (and, by extension, <b>crimping)</b> greatly diminished. The sinking of the RMS Titanic, followed by onset of World War I (which made the high seas a much more dangerous place due to the threat of submarine attack) provided the final impetus to stamp out the practice. In 1915, Andrew Furuseth and Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. pushed through the Seamen's Act of 1915 that made <b>crimping</b> a federal crime, and finally put an end to it.|$|E

30|$|The {{waviness}} or {{distortion of}} a yarn that {{is due to}} interlacing in the fabric is termed as <b>crimp.</b> In woven fabrics, the <b>crimp</b> {{is measured by the}} relation between the length of the fabric sample and the corresponding length of yarn when it is removed there from and straightened under suitable tension. <b>Crimp</b> may be expressed numerically as percentage <b>crimp</b> or <b>crimp</b> ratio. Position of whip roller has significant effect on Crimp% of woven fabric as warp yarn tension is an important player in case of crimp%. It has been found that raising the backrest above the normal height reduces the warp <b>crimp,</b> increasing the weft <b>crimp</b> (Talukdar et al. 1998). In present study, this result was verified both in case of grey and finished state of denim fabric whereas earlier study it was not checked.|$|R

25|$|In 1916, the Original American Kazoo Company in Eden, New York started {{manufacturing}} kazoos for {{the masses}} in a two-room shop and factory, utilizing {{a couple of dozen}} jack presses for cutting, bending and <b>crimping</b> metal sheets.

40|$|Collagen fibres in tendons and ligaments run {{straight}} but in {{some regions}} they show <b>crimps</b> which disappear or appear more flattened during the initial elongation of tissues. Each <b>crimp</b> is formed of collagen fibrils showing knots or fibrillar <b>crimps</b> at the <b>crimp</b> top angle. The present study analyzes by polarized light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy the 3 D morphology of fibrillar <b>crimp</b> in tendons and ligaments of rat demonstrating that each fibril in the fibrillar region always twists leftwards changing the plane of running and sharply bends modifying the course on a new plane. The morphology of fibrillar <b>crimp</b> in stretched tendons fulfills the mechanical role of the fibrillar <b>crimp</b> acting as a particular knot/biological hinge in absorbing tension forces during fibril strengthening and recoiling collagen fibres when stretching is removed. The left-handed path of fibrils in the fibrillar <b>crimp</b> region gives rise to left-handed fibril helices observed both in isolated fibrils and sections of different tendons and ligaments (flexor digitorum profundus muscle tendon, Achilles tendon, tail tendon, patellar ligament and medial collateral ligament of the knee). The left-handed path of fibrils represents a new final suprafibrillar level of the alternating handedness which was previously described only from the molecular to the microfibrillar level. When {{the width of the}} twisting angle in the fibrillar <b>crimp</b> is nearly 180 ° the fibrils appear as left-handed flattened helices forming <b>crimped</b> collagen fibres previously described as planar <b>crimps.</b> When fibrils twist with different subsequent rotational angles (< 180 °) they always assume a left-helical course but, running in many different nonplanar planes, they form wider helical <b>crimped</b> fibres...|$|R

Whether roll <b>crimps</b> or fold <b>crimps</b> are used, cast lead slugs are commonly used in jurisdictions where rifles are banned for hunting, under the reasoning that fired slugs will not travel but over short distances, unlike rifle bullets which can travel up to several miles when fired.

25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the fluted feed rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the <b>crimping</b> box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|E

40|$|Many {{research}} studies made {{on hundreds of}} MSE walls have shown {{that in order to}} get lower values of lateral earth pressure coefficients from an active condition on the backfill soil, thus lower exerted loads and stresses on the reinforcement, the wall needs to yield. This is typical of extensible polymer-based wall systems, such as geosynthetics. Steel systems, on the other hand, are very rigid and do not allow enough deformation on the wall to generate the active condition. For this research, steel reinforcement for MSE walls that behaves similar to geosynthetics was developed. This was done by using <b>crimps</b> on steel bars that would allow the wall to deform as the <b>crimps</b> straighten. A pullout box was designed and constructed, where tensile and pullout tests were performed on the <b>crimped</b> reinforcement. Different <b>crimp</b> geometries on different bar diameters were tested under a range of confining pressures. From this, force-displacement curves were developed for these <b>crimp</b> geometries {{that could be used to}} predict deflections on walls with <b>crimped</b> reinforcement. In addition, the pullout resistance of the <b>crimps</b> in the straighten process was evaluated. This way, the <b>crimps</b> would not only be used to allow the wall to yield, but also as a pullout resistance mechanism. The pullout resistances per <b>crimp</b> for different tensions on the <b>crimp</b> and under a range of overburden pressures were evaluated. By combining the pullout resistance of the <b>crimps</b> and the force-displacement curves, a new internal stability design method was introduced where <b>crimped</b> reinforcement is used to resist both pullout and rupture failure. Also presented here are the pullout resistances of round bars with improved deformations of different diameters. These were found to have the same pullout resistance of square deformed bars with the same cross-sectional area. Round bars are preferred over square bars because they are more corrosion resistant and have longer design life...|$|R

2500|$|Dies for {{bottle neck}} cases usually are {{supplied}} in sets {{of at least}} two dies, though sometimes a third is added for <b>crimping.</b> This is an extra operation and is not needed unless a gun's magazine or action design requires crimped ammunition for safe operation, such as autoloading firearms, where the cycling of the action may push the bullet back in the case, resulting in poor accuracy and increased pressures. [...] <b>Crimping</b> is also sometimes recommended to achieve full velocity for bullets, through increasing pressures so as to make powders burn more efficiently, and for heavy recoiling loads, to prevent bullets from moving under recoil. [...] For FMJ bullets mounted in bottle neck cases, roll <b>crimping</b> is generally not ever used unless a cannelure is present on the bullet, to prevent causing bullet deformation when <b>crimping.</b> [...] Rimless, straight wall cases, on the other hand, require a taper crimp, because they headspace on the case mouth; roll <b>crimping</b> causes headspacing problems on these cartridges. Rimmed, belted, or bottleneck cartridges, however, generally can safely be roll crimped when needed. Three dies are normally supplied for straight walled cases, with an optional fourth die for <b>crimping.</b> Crimps for straight wall cases may be taper crimps, suitable for rimless cartridges used in autoloaders, or roll crimps, which are best for rimmed cartridges such as are used in revolvers.|$|E

2500|$|Work {{hardening}} {{happens to}} all cases, even low-pressure handgun cases. The sudden {{increase in pressure}} upon firing hits the brass like a hammer, changing its crystalline structure and making it more brittle. The neck of the case, if it becomes too brittle, will be incapable of standing the strain of resizing, expanding, <b>crimping,</b> and firing, and will split during loading or firing. While a neck split during firing is not a significant danger, a split neck will render the case incapable of holding the bullet in place, so the case must be discarded or recycled as a wildcat cartridge of shorter overall length, allowing the split section to be removed. [...] The simplest way to decrease the effects of work hardening is to decrease the pressure in the case. Loading to the minimum power level listed in the reloading manual, instead of the maximum, can significantly increase case life. Slower powders generally also have lower pressure peaks, and {{may be a good}} choice.|$|E
