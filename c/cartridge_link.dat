50|$|In {{the final}} design, {{the plan to}} put guns on the fort's roof were abandoned. Instead, eleven casemates were placed in an arc {{on one side of}} the D-shaped fort, {{pointing}} downriver towards Lower Hope Point. An open battery stood at the west end of the casemates, mounting three guns that pointed upriver toward Gravesend and Tilbury. This was to enable artillery support for the older forts at those two towns, which were now relegated to the second line of defence. A single-storey defensible barracks built from Kentish Ragstone stood at the rear of the fort. It was equipped with loopholes so that the garrison could fight off an attack from the landward side. Three caponiers protected the perimeter and an open parade ground occupied the centre of the fort. A ditch originally lay in front of the casemates and open battery but was filled in during the 1880s. The magazines underneath the casemates and open battery consisted of a line of storerooms for shells and <b>cartridges,</b> <b>linked</b> by a lighting passage at the rear and an ammunition passage at the front.|$|R
50|$|The GSh-6-23 {{uses the}} 23x115 Russian AM-23 round, fed via <b>linked</b> <b>cartridge</b> belt or a linkless feed system. The linkless system, adopted after {{problems}} with the belt feed, is limited to 8,500 rpm. Fire control is electrical, using a 27 V DC system. The cannon has 10 pyrotechnic cocking charges, {{similar to those used}} in European gas-operated revolver cannons such as the DEFA 554 or Mauser BK-27.|$|R
50|$|A week later, West Midlands Police {{contacted}} West Mercia. On {{the same}} night of the failed ransom drop, a car had been left near a Freightliner railway terminal in Dudley, where security guard Gerald Smith {{had been shot in}} the back six times, and was now in hospital recovering. In the car were: a cassette tape with Lesley Whittle's voice on it, asking her relatives to co-operate with the kidnapper; her slippers; a roll of plastic tape; all of which linked Neilson to the kidnapping. Ballistics evidence and finger prints on the <b>cartridges</b> also <b>linked</b> the same man to the Freightliner shooting, the previous post office robberies and hence the Black Panther murders.|$|R
50|$|The M27 <b>link,</b> {{formally}} <b>Link,</b> <b>Cartridge,</b> Metallic Belt, 5.56mm, M27 is a disintegrating metallic bullet link {{issued by}} the United States armed forces and designed for use in belt-fed firearms. It holds 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. It was first developed for the Stoner belt-fed Machine Gun in Vietnam but was later resurrected and adapted for use with the FN Minimi LMG / M249 SAW. It is a scaled-down version of the M13 link.|$|R
50|$|The Nintendo Game Link Cable {{is used to}} link two or more {{systems in}} the Game Boy line of handhelds for {{multiplayer}} gaming. Games such as the Pokémon series use the Game Link Cable to transfer data between <b>linked</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Several different variations of Game Link Cables were produced as different Game Boy models had different link cable ports. Various adapters were also produced to interlink different Game Boy models. These variations and adapters are explained in the main article.|$|R
50|$|In the belt-fed configuration, belt {{movement}} {{is produced by}} a roller riding in the channeled feed arm and is actuated by the reciprocating movement of the bolt. The spring-loaded feed arm is protected by a hinged top cover and is pivoted at its rear end. As the bolt travels back, {{the front end of}} the feed arm moves across the feed tray and operates a lever attached to a single set of spring-loaded pawls. These pawls move a <b>cartridge</b> and <b>link</b> over the feed tray’s stop pawl from where they are positioned onto the slotted feed path and held firmly in place by a spring-powered steel plate in the top cover. The cartridge is then pushed out of its link and the empty link is discarded through the link ejection port which is held closed by a spring-loaded dust cover.|$|R
500|$|A {{decision}} was made to replace the six NR-23 guns in the nose with four AM-23 cannon with 225 rounds per gun that had a rate of fire 50% greater than that of the NR-23 and to totally revise the gun installation. The guns were moved to the very tip of the nose in a separate compartment made of heat-resistant steel and provided with a special blast deflector chamber to deflect the blast gasses away from the engine inlets. [...] Two doors were provided {{at the bottom of the}} chamber to ventilate the chamber while firing. One problem occurred almost immediately during testing when the blast gases accumulated in the section where spent <b>cartridges</b> and <b>links</b> were saved and sometimes ignited. Occasionally this was strong enough to actually deform the chamber. The spent shell case section was thoroughly ventilated and muzzle brakes were introduced to successfully cure the problem.|$|R
50|$|This {{is similar}} to the basic 4K 4FA-G1 but is fitted with an Oerlikon Contraves GAD-AOA one-person turret which is armed with a 20 mm Oerlikon Contraves cannon Model 204 GK. This is belt-fed and can be used in both the ground and {{anti-aircraft}} roles. The weapon is provided with 100 rounds of ready use ammunition and the empty <b>cartridge</b> cases and <b>links</b> are ejected outside the turret. The 20 mm cannon has an elevation of +70° and a depression of -12°, turret traverse is 360°. Although its company designation is the 4K 4FA-G2 its Austrian Army designation is the MK66SPz Schützenpanzer/Maschinenkanone 66.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple and small thermal link for cooling a cylindrical car-tridge, on which device under test is mounted. It consists of a crown-like ring with an inner diameter of 170 mm or 140 mm and a clamping belt, which is a metal spring or nylon. A thermal conduction of the thermal link is achieved as the crown-like ring clamps the disk-like stage of the cartridge with external force of a clamping belt. This link can be applied at various temperature ranges from 2 K to 100 K. The measured thermal conductance of the 170 mm link is 1. 7, 5. 6 and 3. 3 W K− 1 for 4, 12, and 80 K stages, respectively. These values are consistent with a empirical calculation within 10 % errors. This link is also effective to reduce mechanical vi-bration to be 6 µm (peak-to-peak) in the horizontal direction of the <b>cartridge.</b> This <b>link</b> is easily fabricated and is useful to various detectors which require to be cooled down...|$|R

5|$|In this installment, Link gains {{experience}} {{points to}} upgrade his attack, magic, and life by defeating enemies. This feature is exclusive to Zelda II {{in the game}} series. He can raise each of these attributes {{to a maximum of}} eight levels. Raising a life level will decrease the damage Link receives when hit, raising a magic level will decrease the magic points (MP) cost of spells, and raising an attack level will strengthen his sword's offensive power. Each attribute requires a different amount of experience to level up, with the life level requiring the least number of points to level and attack requiring the most. When enough points are acquired to raise an attribute, the player may choose to level up that attribute or to cancel and continue gaining experience points towards the next level in another attribute. Once Link has raised an attribute to the maximum level of eight, further advances in that attribute will earn Link an extra life, without advancing the attribute itself. Link begins the game with four Heart Containers and four Magic Containers and can acquire up to four more of each, permanently increasing his life points and magic points respectively. Other games in The Legend of Zelda series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, items, and Heart Containers. Certain enemies drain Link's experience when they attack, but he will never lose a level once raised. When a game ends or is saved, the <b>cartridge</b> records <b>Link's</b> current ability levels and the number of experience points required for the next increase, but resets his accumulated points to zero.|$|R
5000|$|When {{selecting}} a rifle cartridge for maximum accuracy, a short, fat cartridge {{with very little}} case taper may yield higher efficiency and more consistent velocity than a long, thin cartridge {{with a lot of}} case taper (part of the reason for a bottle-necked design). [...] Given current trends towards shorter and fatter cases, such as the new Winchester Super Short Magnum cartridges, it appears the ideal might be a case approaching spherical inside. [...] Target and varmint hunting rounds require the greatest accuracy, so their cases tend to be short, fat, and nearly untapered with sharp shoulders on the case. Short, fat cases also allow short-action weapons to be made lighter and stronger for the same level of performance. The trade-off for this performance is fat rounds which take up more space in a magazine, sharp shoulders that do not feed as easily out of a magazine, and less reliable extraction of the spent round. For these reasons, when reliable feeding is more important than accuracy, such as with military rifles, longer cases with shallower shoulder angles are favored. There has been a long-term trend however, even among military weapons, towards shorter, fatter cases. The current 7.62×51mm NATO case replacing the longer [...]30-06 Springfield is a good example, as is the new 6.5 Grendel cartridge designed to increase the performance of the AR-15 family of rifles and carbines. Nevertheless, there is significantly more to accuracy and cartridge lethality than the length and diameter of the case, and the 7.62x51mm NATO has a smaller case capacity than the [...]30-06 Springfield, reducing the amount of propellant that can be used, directly reducing the bullet weight and muzzle velocity combination that contributes to lethality, (as detailed in the published <b>cartridge</b> specifications <b>linked</b> herein for comparison). The 6.5 Grendel, on the other hand, is capable of firing a significantly heavier bullet (see link) than the 5.56 NATO out of the AR-15 family of weapons, with only a slight decrease in muzzle velocity, perhaps providing a more advantageous performance tradeoff.|$|R
