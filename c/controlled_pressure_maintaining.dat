40|$|Today’s {{high lift}} systems of civil {{transport}} aircraft {{are driven by}} Power Control Units using valve controlled constant displacement hydraulic motors. This concept leads to com-plex valve blocks, attended by high power losses to realise discrete speed <b>control,</b> positioning and <b>pressure</b> <b>maintaining</b> functionality. The concept of secondary controlled hydraulic motors with variable displacement offers reduction in flow consumption without pressure losses and decreases {{the complexity of the}} valve block design. Instead of controlling flow of the hydraulic motor with valves, torque is adjusted to the load by varying displacement. An electronic control circuit allows flexible digital control concepts e. g. load independent speed <b>control,</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>maintaining</b> function-ality, smooth start-up sequences and continuous positioning of the mechanical transmission system. This paper introduces the concept of today’s Power Control Units, the principle and mathematical model of secondary controlled hydraulic motors and the cascade control loop structure. A new hydraulic concept for Power Control Units using secondary controlled hydraulic motors is presented. Theoretical, simulated and experimental results show typical operation sequences under load and a comparison of power requirement to conventional systems.

50|$|An anti-servo tab, or anti-balance tab, {{works in}} the {{opposite}} way to a servo tab. It deploys {{in the same direction}} as the control surface, making the movement of the control surface more difficult and requires more force applied to the controls by the pilot. This may seem counter-productive, but it is commonly used on aircraft where the controls are too light or the aircraft requires additional stability in that axis of movement. The anti-servo tab serves mainly to make the controls heavier in feel to the pilot and also to increase stability. An anti-servo tab also functions as a trim device to relieve <b>control</b> <b>pressure</b> and <b>maintain</b> the stabilator in the desired position.|$|R
50|$|During drilling, <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> is <b>maintained</b> {{through the}} use of {{precisely}} concocted drilling fluid, which balances out the pressure {{at the bottom of the}} hole. In the event of suddenly encountering a high pressure pocket, pressure due to drilling fluid may not be able to counter the high formation pressure. Allowing formation fluid to enter into the well-bore. This influx of formation fluid is called kick and than it becomes necessary to kill the well. This is done by pumping kill mud down the drill pipe, where it circulates out the bottom and into the well bore.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{drilling}} and well completion operations, drilling fluid {{is a crucial}} element as it is employed {{for the purposes of}} several functions. The main functions of drilling fluid are to <b>control</b> formation <b>pressure,</b> <b>maintain</b> the wellbore stability, transport the cuttings up to surface to clean the borehole bottom as well as to lubricate and cool the drill bit. Moreover, it is used to minimize the drilling damage to reservoir and suspend cuttings when the pumping is stop, hence it will not falling back down the borehole. The {{purpose of this study is}} to formulate new drilling mud formulation modified with nanosilica. Six samples of water based mud (WBM) were prepared using three types of polymers, (Xanthan Gum, Hydro Zan Plus and Hydro Star HT), starch and nanosilica. Basic rheological tests such as density, viscosity and pH were carried out. The density test was carried out using mud balance meanwhile the pH test was using pH meter. The plastic viscosity, yield point and gel strength tests were carried out using viscometer. Besides that, physical observation was also performed for as the stability test. The results concluded that water based mud incorporated with polymer Hydro Zan Plus and nanosilica can be a potential candidate to be commercialized as a smart nano drilling fluid...|$|R
40|$|More than 50 % of {{severely}} head-injured patients develop increased intracranial pressure, risking exacerbating ischaemic insults to {{the already}} injured brain. In approximately 10 % of these cases, intracranial pressure may become unresponsive to medical or surgical treatment, with a resulting mortality of over 90 %. The main emphasis should be on full intensive care, based on the prophylaxis of the devastating effects of secondary insults to the injured brain. Specific treatment should be directed towards <b>controlling</b> intracranial <b>pressure</b> and <b>maintaining</b> a cerebral perfusion pressure over 70 mmHg, while avoiding, where feasible, treatment modalities at risk of exacerbating cerebral ischaemia. Recently, an algorithm for treating intracranial hypertension under three different therapeutic situations has been suggested, based on the successive application of effective agents with increasing associated risks.

40|$|Transplantation {{is not a}} cure. It is a {{state of}} chronic kidney disease (CKD), {{regardless}} of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or other markers of kidney damage.

The short- and long-term effects of immunosuppressive medications present new and familiar nutritional challenges to children and their caregivers.

40|$|The kidneys are {{important}} organs that regulate {{the level of}} water and salts in the blood, produce hormones that help to <b>control</b> blood <b>pressure,</b> and <b>maintain</b> homeostasis of the organism by filtering waste products. Kidney disease can either be acute or chronic, the latter progressively worsening over time to become end stage renal disease (ESRD) – a stage when kidneys are non-functional. At present, the only treatment options for ESRD are transplantation or dialysis, which both have severe drawbacks in terms of morbidity, mortality and economic cost. Moreover, the incidence of ESRD is rising annually and an alternative therapy is needed. Therefore, in order to regenerate kidney tissue or prevent worsening of the kidney condition, a new therapy should be developed. One approach is to use embryonic stem cells.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} ecology of the Sandhill Rustic moth Luperina nickerlii leechi and its foodplant Sand Couch-grass Elytrigia juncea.   The {{subspecies}} leechi occurs only at one site, Loe Bar near Helston in Cornwall, and hence is considered to be of high nature conservation concern.   The population of this isolated colony is shown to be variable, with estimates for peak count numbers ranging between 69 (in 1991) and 746 (in 2000).   The total area of Elytrigia juncea on Loe Bar varied {{during the course of this}} study between 11549 m 2 and 13930 m 2; not all of this area is utilised by Sandhill Rustic larvae. A strong female bias is shown (2. 8 : 1 female to male) and the adult females show a clumped distribution. No moth was observed to move more than 349 metres, with females in particular crawling rather than flying; males are more active but rarely fly at wind speeds above 2. 8 m/s. Adult moths appear able to tolerate both high daytime temperatures (over 30 °C) at high salinity levels on the exposed shingle near the sea.   They are associated with the coarser element of sand and shingle present on Loe Bar, perhaps because the larvae can move more easily through the larger sand particles. Sandhill Rustic moths prefer the more vigorous Elytrigia juncea plants that occur near the sea; these plants have a large underground biomass (suitable for the larvae which spend 60 % of their time feeding underground) and grow in large clumps joined together by extensive rhizomes along which the larvae can move. The conservation of Sandhill Rustics on Loe Bar depends in the medium term on <b>controlling</b> visitor <b>pressure,</b> <b>maintaining</b> habitat quality and increasing habitat size.   In the longer term, Sandhill Rustics here are threatened by climate change, in particular sea level rise and an increased number of storm events.

40|$|Background: To {{elucidate}} the renoprotective mechanism of AT 1 -receptor blockers, {{we compared the}} effects of the AT 1 -receptor blocker valsartan with those of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine on renal hemodynamics and microcirculation. Methods: A total of 58 patients (50. 2 ± 9. 0 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension were included in a randomized, double-blind study to receive either valsartan (80 to 160 mg) or amlodipine (5 to 10 mg). Renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured before and after 8 weeks of treatment. Glomerular hydrostatic pressure (PGlo) and resistances of the afferent (RA) and efferent (RE) arterioles were calculated according to the Gomez formulas. Results: Blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> was similar in both groups. RPF did not change with either treatment. In contrast, GFR increased with amlodipine (+ 8 ± 14 mL/min; P &# 60;. 01) but was preserved with valsartan. Amlodipine caused a more marked increase in the RE/RA ratio than valsartan (+ 0. 26 ± 0. 26 v + 0. 13 ± 0. 24, P &# 60;. 05), which was paralleled by an increase in PGlo in patients treated with amlodipine (+ 1. 9 ± 4. 3 mm Hg; P &# 60;. 05) but not in those treated with valsartan. Conclusions: At similar blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control,</b> valsartan <b>maintained</b> GFR and PGlo, whereas amlodipine led to glomerular hyperfiltration and an increase in PGlo. The results might explain the favorable renal outcome with AT 1 -receptor blocker therapy. </p...|$|R
