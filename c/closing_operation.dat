The first two total syntheses were a [...] "remarkable... stereoselective synthesis" [...] by Schmid and Hofheinz at Hoffmann-La Roche in Basel starting from (−)-isopulegol (13 steps, ~5% overall yield) and a concurrent synthesis by Zhou and coworkers at the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry from (R)-(+)-citronellal (20 steps, ~0.3% overall yield). Key {{steps of the}} Schmid-Hofheinz approach included an initial Ohrloff stereoselective hydroboration/oxidation to establish the [...] "off-ring" [...] methyl stereocenter on the propene side chain; two sequential lithium-reagent mediated alkylations that introduced all needed carbon atoms and that were, together highly diastereoselective; and further reduction, oxidation, and desilylation steps performed on this mono-carbocyclic intermediate, including a final singlet oxygen-utilizing photooxygenation and ene reaction, which, after acidic workup closed the three remaining oxacyclic rings of the desired product, artemisinin, in a single step.

In a previous paper, we discussed various ways in which to construct and process strict partial order relations {{in the context of}} ranking objects on the basis of multiple criteria. We now broaden the scope to include more general expressions of preferences as inputs and introduce the concept of a NIP-triple, composed of a relation of necessary couples, a relation of impossible couples and a relation of possible couples. The use of NIP-triples allows for a more straightforward characterization of the consistent and prioritized consistent union as well as a smooth formulation of algorithmic implementations. We also introduce a NIP-triple <b>closing</b> <b>operation,</b> which can be combined with the consistent union operations for increased flexibility. Some properties of the proposed operations are examined.

40|$|Airborne LiDAR, as {{a precise}} and fast earth’s surface {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) measuring method, {{has been widely}} {{used in the past}} decades. It provides a new approach for acquiring road information. By analyzing the characteristics of LiDAR datasets {{as well as that of}} the road in the datasets, a morphological method has been proposed to automatically extract the road from airborne LiDAR datasets. Firstly, ground points are segmented from raw LiDAR data by morphological operations. The key factor in this process is how to select the window sizes in different scale spaces, and setting the elevation threshold to prevent over-segmentation in each scale space. Secondly, candidate road points are segmented from the ground points, which are obtained from previous step, by intensity constraint, local point density and region area constraint, and so on. Thirdly, morphological opening operation and <b>closing</b> <b>operation</b> were used to process the candidate road points segmented from above steps. The opening operation may effectively filter the noise areas, and greatly maintain the road detail. The <b>closing</b> <b>operation</b> may fill the small holes within the road, connecting nearby roads, and smoothing the road boundary, without signification area change. The main road can be extracted from the raw airborne LiDAR points by previous three steps. Finally, the proposed method has been verified by LiDAR data which consists of complex road networks. The result shows that the proposed method can automatically extract road from airborne LiDAR data with higher efficiency and precision...|$|E
