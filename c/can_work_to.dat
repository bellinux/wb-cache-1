25|$|The most {{effective}} strategy predators use against schooling fish is first to scare them into forming a bait ball. Strategies {{such as those}} outlined {{in the previous section}} <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> a degree against freely streaming fish schools, but work much better if the fish school is first compacted into a bait ball. It is difficult for predators working individually to scare a fish school into a bait ball, and they usually work together.|$|E
25|$|In Angel season four, Angel is {{reverted to}} the evil Angelus after having his soul removed. Faith is {{approached}} by her former Watcher, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof), who informs her of Angelus's presence, sparking her {{to break out}} of prison and help them. Wanting to help Angel the way he helped her, Faith injects herself with a mystical drug and feeds herself to Angelus in order to incapacitate him so that their allies <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> restore his soul. She nearly dies from the drug, but during a psychic mind walk, Angel persuades her subconscious not to give up and that life is worth living.|$|E
25|$|Even if {{the theatre}} is morally innocuous, Rousseau argues, its {{presence}} is disruptive to potentially productive use of time. Moreover, theatre {{is incompatible with}} the rural mindset, where people work hard, {{and as a result}} should find simple relaxation pleasurable, rather than the extravagant, over-stimulating entertainment which retards the imagination. A theatre in Geneva would cause the hardworking people to be distracted and pre-occupied if they were to develop a taste for it. Though a theatre <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> distract the masses of the cities from crime, it is of no use to a smaller city like Geneva, which is relatively innocent. Rousseau also describes the weather and geography of Geneva, and argues that it is not particularly conducive to supporting a theatre.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{effective}} communication among patients and healthcare professionals {{is critical for}} achieving a patient's optimal health outcome. However, according to the Canadian Patient Safety Institute, ineffective communication has the opposite effect as {{it can lead to}} patient harm. Communication with regards to patient safety can be classified into two categories: prevention of adverse events and responding to adverse events. Use {{of effective}} communication can aid in the prevention of adverse events, whereas ineffective communication can contribute to these incidences. If ineffective communication contributes to an adverse event, then better and more effective communication skills must be applied in response to achieve optimal outcomes for the patient's safety. There are different modes in which healthcare professionals <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> optimize the safety of patients which include both verbal and nonverbal communication, as well as the effective use of appropriate communication technologies.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} proteins {{which make up}} the mammalian TTNFL are the Period (PER), and Cryptochrome (CRY) proteins, BMAL1, CLOCK, and casein kinase 1 epsilon. PER and CRY levels are regulated by negative feedback, meaning that they repress their own transcription. BMAL1 and CLOCK work to increase PER and CRY transcription by binding on the E-box domain upstream from the PER and CRY gene coding sequences. The level of PER and CRY proteins is regulated by casein kinase 1 through phosphorylation, which marks these proteins for degradation by the cell. Phosphorylation also hinders PER's ability to enter the nucleus by inducing a conformational change in its nuclear localization sequence. However, if CRY proteins bind to PER before this phosphorylation can occur, all three proteins stabilize into a complex that can enter the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, PER and CRY <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> inhibit their own transcription, while casein kinase 1 epsilon works to modulate the activity of BMAL1 and CLOCK through phosphorylation.|$|E
500|$|The SPLC {{stated that}} The Daily Stormer owed its success to the online imageboard 4chan {{becoming}} popular among racists, as both websites use similar memes and rhetorical styles. One meme the website has used is to overlay photographs of Taylor Swift with anti-Semitic quotations, including those by Hitler. The website puts triple parentheses around {{the names of}} Jews, a far-right meme created by fellow website The Right Stuff. Jacob Siegel of The Daily Beast wrote that the website was growing in popularity amongst a younger audience due to its use of humor, and was attracting activists of other anti-political correctness ideologies—such as Gamergaters, men's rights activists and opponents of Social Justice Warriors—who would not usually identify with fascism. The SPLC has also documented Anglin's involvement in and encouragement of culture jamming by making hyperbolic statements in fake online accounts as women and minorities. He has also said that [...] "ridiculous" [...] statements such as [...] "gas the kikes", if repeated in media coverage, <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> desensitize the public to the Holocaust. He also believes that his extreme right-wing rhetoric can normalize less extreme right-wingers such as Trump.|$|E

500|$|The most {{significant}} {{benefit of the}} use of the technique is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone intensity in areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither possible nor routinely available. [...] Intensity estimates of maximum sustained wind are currently within [...] of what aircraft are able to measure half of the time, though the assignment of intensity of systems with strengths between moderate tropical-storm force (...) and weak hurricane- or typhoon-force (...) is the least certain. [...] Its overall precision has not always been true, as refinements in the technique led to intensity changes between 1972 and 1977 of up to [...] [...] The method is internally consistent in that it constrains rapid increases or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity. [...] Some tropical cyclones fluctuate in strength more than the 2.5 T numbers per day limit allowed by the rule, which <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> the technique's disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment of the constraints since the 1980s. [...] Systems with small eyes near the limb, or edge, of a satellite image can be biased too weakly using the technique, which can be resolved through use of polar-orbiting satellite imagery. [...] Subtropical cyclone intensity cannot be determined using Dvorak, which {{led to the development of}} the Hebert-Poteat technique in 1975. [...] Cyclones undergoing extratropical transition, losing their thunderstorm activity, see their intensities underestimated using the Dvorak technique. [...] This led to the development of the Miller and Lander extratropical transition technique which can be used under these circumstances.|$|E
