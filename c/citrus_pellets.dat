40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the fermentation profile of orange bagasse ensiled with {{three levels of}} dry matter (DM) using <b>citrus</b> pulp <b>pellets</b> as a moisture-absorbing additive. Thirty experimental silos (3 treatments, 5 storage times, 2 replicates) were prepared using 25 -liter plastic buckets containing orange bagasse and three levels of <b>pelleted</b> <b>citrus</b> pulp (0, 6 % and 20 %) as additive. A completely randomized design with repeated measures over time was used. The periods of anaerobic storage were 3, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days. Natural orange bagasse contained 13. 9 % DM, which increased to 19. 1 % and 25. 5 % with the inclusion of 6 % and 20 % <b>citrus</b> pulp <b>pellets,</b> respectively. The apparent density was inversely correlated with DM content and {{a higher level of}} compaction (982 kg/m 3) was observed in the mass ensiled with the lowest DM level (13. 9 %). Additionally, lower compaction (910 kg/m 3) was found in the mass ensiled with the additive. The chemical composition of the mass ensiled with or without <b>citrus</b> pulp <b>pellets</b> did not differ significantly in terms of protein, ether extract, neutral detergent fiber, lignin or in vitro DM digestibility (P≥ 0. 05), as expected. Thus, it was possible to analyze only the effect of the inclusion of <b>citrus</b> pulp <b>pellets</b> on the increase in DM content. The inclusion of 20 % of the additive reduced (P< 0. 01) losses due to effluent (98 % less) and gas production (81 % less) compared to the control treatment {{at the end of the}} anaerobic storage period. In this treatment, a higher (P≤ 0. 05) log number of lactic acid bacteria (4. 61 log CFU/g) was also observed compared to the other treatments, indicating that the increase in DM favored the growth of these bacteria. In addition, the low yeast count (about 1 log CFU/g sample) and the pH below 4. 0, which were probably due to the production of lactic and acetic acids, show that the orange bagasse is rich in fermentable soluble carbohydrates and is indicated for ensiling. In conclusion, orange bagasse can be efficiently conserved as silage if the initial DM content is at least 25 %. The inclusion of 20 % (in relation to orange bagasse weight) <b>citrus</b> pulp <b>pellets</b> as moisture-absorbing additive is recommended to guarantee adequate fermentation and to reduce losses inherent to the ensiling process...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was developed to}} evaluate {{the effect of the}} replacement of corn grain by dehydrated <b>citrus</b> pulp <b>pellets</b> on the performance and carcass characteristics of Santa Gertrudis young bulls fed high concentrate diets. Twenty-eight bulls, with average age of nine months and an initial weight of 277 kg, were kept in individual pens and fed during 92 days, after 21 days of adaptation. The animals were fed a diet with 20 % of the dry matter as corn silage, with 40 % of grain.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this trial was to evaluate the nutritional value, fermentation profile and dry matter losses of Palisadegrass silages ensiled with either dried citrus pulp, soybean hulls, chemical or microbial additives. The trial {{was carried out in}} a completely randomized experimental design and in a factorial arrangement (3 x 5), with three dry matter levels (wet forage or forage ensiled with <b>pelleted</b> <b>citrus</b> pulp or <b>pelleted</b> soybean hulls) and five additives (without or with the presence of bacterial inoculants or the addition of: sodium benzoate, formic acid in the concentration of 62 % or 44 %), totalizing 15 treatments and 60 experimental silos. The variables analyzed were: nutritional value, losses due to gases and effluents, and dry matter recovery. The use of dried citrus pulp or soybean hulls at the ensiling time increased the dry matter content (29. 4 and 28, 9 %) and decreased the effluent production (4. 1 and 3. 8 kg/t of fresh matter), also providing fermentable substrate to microorganisms, resulting in increased fermentation coefficient and digestibility of silages. The use of formic acid resulted in silages with higher digestibility and increased water-soluble carbohydrates and crude protein content. This additive was also effective in reducing the losses due to gases and, as a result, increased the total dry matter recovery. The treatment containing homolactic bacteria showed similar trend of increasing the digestibility and reducing the losses due to gases. The use of sodium benzoate was less effective in altering the fermentation pattern of tropical silages. The nutritional value and total dry matter losses of silages ensiled without additives can be considered satisfactory. However, wet forage ensiled with dried citrus pulp and, mainly, with soybeans hulls showed the best results.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the effects of different feed concentrates on sheep behaviour. Our hypothesis was that citric pulp would stimulate rumination and be capable of replacing other concentrates traditionally used for feeding in confinement, {{to reduce the risk of}} urolithiasis. Ten adult Santa In&# 234;s sheep were distributed in a Latin square with five different diets, one control diet with 80 % hay and 20 % commercial feed and four diets containing 30 % coast-cross hay and 70 % of the following concentrates: <b>pelleted</b> <b>citrus</b> pulp, citrus pulp meal, cornmeal or wheat bran. After 21 d of adaptation to each one of the five diets, the sheep were visually monitored for 24 h at 3 min intervals to record the time spent ruminating, time spent eating and time spent resting; the animals' positions (standing or lying down) were also noted. Daytime was considered to be from 06 : 00 h to 18 : 00 h. The data were evaluated using ANOVA, with Tukey post-hoc test or throughout Two-sample T test for circadian and position assessment. Citrus pulp diets resulted in time spent ruminating similar to the control diet (601, 590 and 669 min, respectively), but greater (P< 0. 05) than the cornmeal group (421 min), which showed that citrus pulp generated effective rumination. The estimated saliva production in the control diet (26 L) was greater than in the other groups, and was greater in the citrus pulp groups (24 L/d) than cornmeal (21 L/d). Feeding with cornmeal led to shorter time spent eating and time spent ruminating than all other diets. The sheep had higher time spent resting at night when fed concentrates (P< 0. 05). For all diets, about 90 % of the time spent ruminating occurred with the animals lying down. <b>Pelleted</b> <b>citrus</b> pulp, citrus pulp meal and to a lesser degree wheat bran, led to adequate time spent ruminating.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of inclusion of different levels of <b>pelleted</b> <b>citrus</b> pulp (PCP) on the quality of xaraés grass silage. Xaraés grass was ensiled at 54 days of growth with 0, 10, 20 and 30 % PCP and divided into 20 experimental silos (five repetitions/treatment). A completely randomized design was adopted. The silos were opened after 67 days for the determination of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), pH, and titratable acidity of the silages. The inclusion of PCP did not influence DM content, but reduced CP content. NDF and ADF content decreased with the addition of citrus pulp. Regarding pH, a significant difference was only observed for the inclusion of 30 % PCP. Titratable acidity in the silage was lower in the absence of PCP (0 %) compared to the treatment with 30 % (P< 0. 05). The inclusion of 30 % PCP in xaraés grass silage is indicated since it improves the quality of the fibrous fraction, while maintaining acceptable pH values...|$|R

O delineamento utilizado foi o inteiramente ao acaso com três repetições, em esquema de parcelas subdivididas. A inclusão de PCP aumentou os teores de MS e diminuiu o pH das silagens. A adição de PCP influenciou os teores de N-NH 3 (N total), uma vez que, nas silagens sem PCP, os teores N-NH 3 foram significativamente elevados, o que as caracteriza como de qualidade duvidosa. A adição de PCP aumentou a concentração molar dos ácidos acético e propiônico. A população de enterobactérias foi detectada somente no primeiro dia de fermentação nas silagens do capim-tanzânia e até o 18 º dia nas do capim-marandu.

In experiment 3, the microbial population was characterized and the aerobic steady was analyzed in Marandu-grass silage plus PCP. In experiment 1, PCP addition increased soluble carbohydrate levels and, instead of its low concentration in the studied treatments, PCP provided silages with satisfactory quality. The pH decreased with the increasing in additive proportion and stabilized quickly from fourth day of ensilage. N-NH 3 levels (% of total N) were affected by PCP, but when it was not added these levels were low too, and it did not prejudice the silage quality. In relation to chemical composition, the additive utilization increased CP, NDF-N, ADF-N and B 3 fraction levels, and it reduced cellular wall components which increased DMIVD coefficients. Considering microbiological profile, results showed increase in enterobacteria population only at the first day of fermentation because of the high density and acid conditions.

The measurements of emissions comprised carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO x), unburned hydrocarbons (C x H y), sulphur oxides (SO x) and flue dust mass concentration (by DINplus and isokinetic sampling methods). Comparison of experimental emission values with relevant quality labels (Blue Angel and Swan Mark) and standard (EN- 303 - 5) showed that the boiler satisfied the emissions requirements of Blue Angel, Swan Mark and EN- 303 - 5 when using wood pellets- 1 (except CO emission), reed canary grass and <b>citrus</b> pectin waste <b>pellets</b> as fuel at nominal load. The wood pellets- 1 yielded the highest boiler efficiency of 92. 4 %.

NO x emissions were below the concerned permissible values with all experimental pellets. Emissions of NO x and SO x were found maximum with straw pellets. For agro-pellets, statistical differences in ash contents were significant. High ash contents and low ash melting temperature made straw pellets less suitable for domestic applications.

O arranjo resultou em 15 silagens, com 4 repetições, portanto 60 silos experimentais. Avaliaram-se o valor nutritivo, as perdas por gases e efluente e a recuperação de matéria seca (MS). A adição de polpa cítrica ou casca de soja peletizada elevou os teores de MS (29, 4 e 28, 9 %), o que reduziu a produção de efluente (4, 1 e 3, 8 kg/t MV) e disponibilizou substratos fermentescíveis aos microrganismos, fato confirmado pela maior capacidade fermentativa e pela digestibilidade das silagens. Os aditivos à base de ácido fórmico foram mais efetivos em preservar carboidratos solúveis e proteína, o que culminou em maior digestibilidade. Esses aditivos também reduziram as perdas por gases e elevaram a recuperação de MS. O inoculante contendo bactérias homoláticas não diferiu desses aditivos quanto à digestibilidade das silagens e ainda reduziu as perdas por gases. Entre os aditivos, o benzoato foi o menos efetivo em alterar o padrão fermentativo das silagens de capim-marandu. O valor nutritivo e as perdas da silagem com teor de umidade original, não aditivada, podem ser considerados satisfatórios, contudo, a polpa cítrica e principalmente a casca de soja peletizadas se mostraram opção interessante e devem ser mais estudadas.

The effect of substituting inorganic by organic mineral sources was not conclusive. Daily dry matter intake was 19. 4 kg for citrus diets and 20. 5 kg with corn (P= 0. 03). The digestible organic matter intake was increased by corn supplementation (P< 0. 01). There was a trend for a decreased fractional rate of in situ ruminal degradation of corn silage dry matter (P= 0. 11) and for increased size of the indigestible fraction (P= 0. 15) in diets with corn, suggesting that degradation of forages did not determine the lower intake for citrus diets. The total substitution of corn by citrus pulp may decrease intake and digestibility...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo desta pesquisa foi estudar três níveis de polpa de citros peletizada (PCP) em substituição ao milho em dietas de potras em crescimento. Vinte e uma potras da raça Árabe e Cruza-Árabe, com peso inicial de 278 + 9, 6 kg e 18 meses de idade, foram usadas. Os animais foram mantidos em baias individuais e diariamente exercitados. Foi usado delineamento inteiramente casualizado com três tratamentos, dieta basal (T 1), 7, 5 % PCP (T 2) e 15 % PCP (T 3), e sete repetições, em que a potra foi a unidade {{experimental}}. O período experimental foi de 16 semanas. As dietas foram formuladas com 40 % de volumoso (feno de Cynodon dactylon Pers cv coast-cross) e 60 % de concentrado, 14, 5 % de proteína bruta (PB) e 2, 77 kcal/g de energia digestível na matéria seca (MS). Ganho em peso, o consumo voluntário (gMS/kg 0, 75) e perímetro torácico dos animais não diferiram entre os tratamentos. A altura média na cernelha para animais T 1 (6, 8 + 1, 0 cm) foi superior à de T 2 (3, 4 + 1, 0 cm) e T 3 (4, 6 + 1, 0 cm). O coeficiente de digestibilidade aparente da MS para T 2 (68, 7 + 1, 2 %) e T 3 (67, 52 + 1, 2 %) foram superiores ao de T 1 (58, 62 + 1, 2 %). O mesmo fato ocorreu para a PB, sendo T 2 (77, 1 + 1, 5 %) e T 3 (78, 6 + 1, 5 %) maiores que T 1 (70, 8 + 1, 5 %). Para o teor de energia bruta, T 2 (59, 8 + 0, 4 %) foi inferior a T 1 (62, 0 + 0, 4 %) e T 3 (61, 2 + 0, 4 %). Não houve diferença entre os tratamentos para fibra em detergente neutro, fibra em detergente ácido e taxas de passagem das fases sólida e líquida das digestas das diferentes dietas. A polpa de citrus peletizada pode ser usada até o nível de 15 % em rações de potras em crescimento, sem influir no desempenho do animal. The {{objective of}} this research was to study three levels of <b>pelleted</b> <b>citrus</b> pulp (PCP) in substitution to corn in diets of growing fillies. Twenty-one purebred and crossbred Arabian fillies averaging 278 + 9. 6 kg of initial live weight and 18 months of age were used. The animals were maintained in individual pens and were daily exercised. A completely randomized design with three treatments: basal diet (T 1), 7. 5 % PCP (T 2) and 15. 0 % PCP (T 3) with seven replicates, and with the filly as the experimental unit. The experimental period was of 16 weeks. The diets were formulated with 40 % of coast-cross (Cynodon dactylon Pers) hay and 60 % of concentrate, 14. 5 % of crude protein (CP), 2. 77 kcal/g of digestible energy, on the dry matter (DM) basis. Weight gain, voluntary feed intake (gDM/kg. 75) and the hearth girth did not differ among the treatments. The average withers height for T 1 (6. 8 + 1. 0 cm) was higher than T 2 (3. 4 + 1. 0 cm) and T 3 (4. 6 + 1. 0 cm). The DM apparent digestibility coefficient for T 2 (68. 7 + 1. 2 %) and T 3 (67. 5 + 1. 2 %) were higher than T 1 (58. 6 + 1. 2 %). The same result was obtained for the CP, T 2 (77. 1 + 1. 5 %) and T 3 (78. 6 + 1. 5 %) were higher than that for T 1 (70. 8 + 1. 5 %). For the gross energy, T 2 (59. 8 + 0. 4 %) was lower than both T 1 (62. 0 + 0. 4 %) and T 3 (61. 2 + 0. 4 %). There were no differences among the treatments for neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and the solid and liquid passage rate of the digesta. The <b>pelleted</b> <b>citrus</b> pulp can be used up to 15, 0 % in the diets of growing fillies, without affecting the animal performance...|$|R
40|$|Doze vacas lactantes, da raça Holandesa puras e mestiças, com peso vivo médio inicial de 550 kg, foram distribuídas em três quadrados latinos. O período {{experimental}} foi de 18 dias, sete de dias adaptação à dieta e onze dias para coleta de dados. A alimentação fornecida foi para atender os requerimentos de vacas não gestantes produzindo 20 kg de leite com 4, 5 % de gordura, com o objetivo de avaliar a digestibilidade dos nutrientes, esta em dois períodos de coleta de amostra de fezes (2 e 5 dias) e no líquido ruminal o pH e nitrogênio amoniacal. A digestibilidade dos nutrientes não foi afetada pelo período de coleta, como também não houve diferença na digestibilidade para os níveis crescentes de polpa cítrica. Não houve diferença significativa (P> 0, 05) para pH e nitrogênio amoniacal do rúmen para os diferentes tratamentos. A polpa cítrica pode substituir até 100 % do milho em dietas completas para vacas produzindo em média 20 kg de leite sem alterar os parâmetros ruminais (pH e amônia amoniacal). Twelve milking cows, purebred and crossbred Holstein, {{with average}} weight of 550 kg, were allotted to three Latin Squares 4 x 4. The experimental period lasted 18 days, seven {{days for the}} adaptation to the diets and eleven days for data collection. Feeding was supplied to met the requirements of non pregnant cows, producing 20 kg of milk with 4. 5 % fat. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effects of replacement (0, 33, 67, 100 %) of corn meal by <b>pelleted</b> <b>citrus</b> pulp in the concentrate in total mixed rations, observing the parameters digestibility of the nutrients, and ruminal pH and ammonia concentration during two periods of collection of sample of feces (2 and 5 days). The digestibility of the nutrients were not affected by the collection period, as well as there were not differences in the digestibility for the increasing levels of citrus pulp. No significant differences were observed for pH and ammonia concentration of the rumen for the different treatments. The citrus pulp can substitute up to 100 % of the corn in complete diets for cows producing 20 kg of milk in average, without effect on the ruminal parameters (pH and ammonia concentration) ...|$|R
2500|$|While when a {{contract}} is silent a court must essentially {{make an informed}} choice about whether a right to terminate should exist, if {{a contract}} deals with the matter the courts' general approach is to follow the parties' wishes. The drafters of the old Sale of Goods Act 1893 distinguished between [...] "conditions" [...] (major terms, which when breached confer a right to terminate) and [...] "warranties" [...] (minor terms, which do not), and under the present Sale of Goods Act 1979 some terms, such as descriptions about quality, are conditions by default. A third kind is an [...] "innominate term", which is typically a vague term like <b>citrus</b> pulp <b>pellets</b> being [...] "in good condition", or a ship having to be [...] "seaworthy". Because such a term could be breached in both a major way (e.g. the ship sinks) or a trivial way (e.g. a lifejacket is missing) the court will determine whether the right to terminate arises based on how serious in fact {{the consequences of the}} breach were. So in The Hong Kong Fir, Lord Diplock held that a ship crew being too incompetent to properly operate the vessel did not breach the contract's [...] "seaworthiness" [...] term in a serious enough way as to allow for termination, because the charterers still got a working boat and could have replaced the crew. If a contract specifies that a particular obligation is a [...] "condition" [...] the dominant approach of the courts is to treat it as such. Nevertheless, concerned with the ability of a stronger party to specify the terms it finds most convenient as [...] "conditions" [...] {{at the expense of the}} weaker, courts retain the ability to construe an agreement contra proferentum. In L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd the majority of the House of Lords held that clause 7 of a contract, stating it was [...] "a condition of this agreement" [...] that Mr Wickman would visit 6 major car companies [...] "at least once in every week" [...] to try selling panel presses, was not really a condition in the technical sense. So when Mr Wickman was found to have visited much less, Schuler AG could not dismiss him. This was because clause 11 said that 60 days of warning was needed before Schuler AG could terminate, so the whole contract read together meant the clause 7 had to be subject to clause 11. The language in the contract is not decisive. If the word [...] "condition" [...] is not used, but the contract describes a right to terminate, such as the contract being terminable for [...] "any breach" [...] of obligation, the issue is, again, one of construction and the courts may be reluctant to give effect to the plain meaning if it would have [...] "draconian consequences" [...] for the weaker party. By contrast, in Bunge Corporation v Tradax SA the House of Lords held that giving notice for a ship to start loading the soya bean cargo four days late, when the contract expressly stipulated the date, should allow the right to terminate regardless of the actual consequences of the breach. In mercantile contracts, 'broadly speaking time will be considered of the essence', and so it is highly likely the courts will enforce obligations to the letter.|$|R
40|$|Esta pesquisa foi realizada com os objetivos de caracterizar a microbiologia e avaliar a estabilidade aeróbia de silagens de capim-marandu contendo polpa cítrica peletizada (PCP). A forragem colhida foi submetida aos seguintes tratamentos: silagem de capim-marandu; silagem de capim-marandu + 5 % PCP e silagem do capim-marandu + 10 % de PCP com base na matéria natural. As alterações químicas e microbiológicas foram feitas aos 0, 2, 4 e 6 dias após a abertura dos silos (tambores de metal com 80 cm de altura e 50 cm de diâmetro). Na avaliação da estabilidade aeróbia por meio da alteração da temperatura, 3 kg de silagem foram colocados em caixas de isopor, que foram armazenadas em câmara climática. Nos dois ensaios realizados, utilizou-se delineamento inteiramente ao acaso com cinco repetições, em esquema de parcelas subdivididas, de modo que os níveis de PCP na silagem corresponderam às parcelas e o tempo, às subparcelas. As silagens sem polpa apresentaram desenvolvimento de bacilos e enterobactérias e aumento do pH no decorrer do desabastecimento dos silos. A presença de leveduras foi detectada nas silagens contendo o aditivo e aumentou do primeiro ao sexto dia de aeração. A digestibilidade {{in vitro}} da matéria seca (DIVMS) reduziu com o aumento dos tempos de aeração. A temperatura nas silagens com 10 % de PCP aumentou durante a aerobiose. Com a abertura dos silos, as silagens apresentaram-se instáveis, seja pelo desenvolvimento de bactérias seja pelo desenvolvimento de leveduras, o que reduziu seu valor nutritivo. This trial had the {{objective}} of characterizing the microbial population and evaluating the aerobic stability of Marandu grass silages with <b>pelleted</b> <b>citrus</b> pulp (PCP). The collected forage was submitted to the following treatments: Silage of Marandu grass; silage of Marandu grass + 50 g/kg PCP and silage of Marandu grass + 100 g/kg PCP on natural matter basis. Metal cylindrical containers with 80 cm of height and 50 cm of diameter were used as silos during assays of microbiological dynamics and chemical changes of silages in anaerobiosis. Evaluations were performed on days 0, 2, 4 and 6 after silos were opened. The aerobic stability was evaluated by change in temperature, using approximately three kilograms of silage inside styrofoam boxes that were placed inside a climatic chamber. A completely randomized experimental design and split plot arrangement {{were used in the}} two assays, with five replications. Treatments were the plots and time was the subplots. Bacillus and enterobacteria were present on the Marandu grass silages with 0 g/kg PCP, which also showed pH increase throughout the feedout phase. Yeast was detected on the silages that were added with PCP. A trend of increasing temperature with extension of the aeration time was observed mainly in the silages containing 100 g/kg PCP. Isolated yeast strains showed lactate assimilation. Silages were found to be unstable due to the silo opening, both by bacterial or yeast development, which reduced the nutritional value...|$|R
