Significantly, the CSA showed excellent catalytic hydrolysis performance for the lignocellulosic biomass under microwave irradiation, especially for the conversion of hemicellulose of the biomass. Microwave irradiation could greatly enhance the catalytic performance in our system. Various reaction parameters, such as temperature, reaction time, the amount of CSA and the ratio of solid to liquid, were evaluated. At mild temperatures (383 – 413 K), the cellulose and hemicellulose in the corncobs could be decomposed into corresponding sugars. The maximum glucose yield, xylose yield and arabinose yield could reach 34. 6, 77. 3 and 100 %, respectively. The CSA can be recycled and reused.

The current traffic impact analysis (TIA) is lack of a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>component</b> for non-motorized transportation under redevelopment. For a better guidance of land redevelopment and non-motorized transportation planning, it is necessary to evaluate the negative impact of redevelopment on non-motorized traffic in the TIA. In this paper, an evaluation framework for the impact analysis is built up. We organized the procedures and components of impact evaluation, and proposed the corresponding qualitative and quantitative evaluation indicators for non-motorized traffic under redevelopment. Level of service (LOS) and its criterion are employed for external impact evaluation, and level of safety, convenience, independence, and comfort which are four aspects of quality of service (QOS) are proposed to analyze the internal impact. The framework is applied to a redevelopment study in Shanghai, China. The case study results indicate that the redevelopment from a residential area to a mixed commercial area has a significant impact on non-motorized traffic. The potential negative impact from both external and internal traffic can be minimized by reasonable improvements in the internal land use design...|$|E
40|$|Large scale systems, {{common in}} cloud computing, rely on {{redundancy}} for reliability and availability. Modern clouds have become ever-increasingly complex and diverse creating large messes that experience long outages when failures occur. While there exist significant effort in resolving faults after they occur, we propose {{a novel approach}} to untangling this mess before it occurs by auditing the underlying structure of a cloud, which we call the cloud Structural Reliability Auditor (SRA). SRA achieves our goal by auditing a cloud with the following steps: 1) collecting <b>comprehensive</b> <b>component</b> and its dependency information, 2) using this data to construct a system-wide fault tree, 3) and leveraging fault tree analysis algorithms to determine and rank sets of components based on the likelihood of causing a cloud service outage. SRA enables a cloud administrator {{to be able to}} evaluate risks within the cloud beforehand and improve the reliability of her service deployments before the occurrences of critical failure events. We have built a prototype implementation that performs all three tasks. Using this prototype, our experimental evaluation shows that SRA is practical: auditing a cloud containing 13, 824 servers and 3, 000 switches spends about 6 hours. ...|$|E

Nonetheless, radical reform continued to face some critical political barriers. The Soviet-era Central Bank was still subordinate to the conservative Supreme Soviet who continued to support socialist policies in opposition to Yeltsin and the presidency. During the height of hyperinflation in 1992-1993, the Central Bank actually tried to derail reforms by actively printing even more money during this period of inflation. After all, the Russian government was short of revenue and was forced to print money to finance its debt. As a result, inflation exploded into hyperinflation, and the Russian economy continued into an evermore serious slump.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Development of robust prognostics {{for digital}} {{electronic}} system health management will improve device reliability and maintainability for many industries with products ranging from enterprise network servers to military aircraft. Information {{from a variety}} of sources is required to develop an effective, robust, and technically sound health management system for digital electronics. The presented technical approach integrates collaborative diagnostic and prognostic techniques from engineering disciplines including statistical reliability, damage accumulation modeling, physics of failure modeling, signal processing and feature extraction, and automated reasoning algorithms. These advanced prognostic/diagnostic algorithms utilize intelligent data fusion architectures to optimally combine sensor data with probabilistic component models to achieve the best decisions on the overall health of digital components and systems. By utilizing a combination of health monitoring data and model-based techniques, a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>component</b> prognostic capability can be achieved throughout the device’s life, using model-based estimates when no diagnostic indicators are present, and monitored features such as current draw, die temperature and logic errors at later stages of component lifespan when failure indications are detectable.

But due {{to the structure of}} plant foods diagnostic value should have exactly a complex component of impedance. Article tasked with developing criteria for assessing the functional state of the products subject to a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>component</b> of the impedance. Research methodology. To determine the functional status of the fruit were measured module and phase of impedance at the three frequencies of 20, 100 and 500 kHz. Criteria for recognition of functional status determined by the dynamics of changes in the parameters of the complex impedance due to destructive processes caused by dehydration and putrefaction processes. Data processing and analysis. On the basis of experimental data obtained at three frequencies modeled frequency and phase response and their changes during losing of freshness and appearance of destructive processes. Discussion and conclusions. In fresh and stale fruit modulus and phase of the impedance at low and high frequencies have characteristic differences. But this is especially evident on the phase-frequency characteristic, which can be seen that the value of the phase with the loss of freshness at low frequency decreases and increases at high more than twice during one week. Therefore, to assess the functional state of fresh and stale products we suggest use phase portraits of phase response. Comment: In Ukrainian. Available at: [URL] Visn. NTUU KPI, Ser.
