5000|$|Mrs Peel {{arrives at}} Armstrong's factory, with the <b>Cybernaut</b> still {{following}} the pen she carries. Steed escapes {{and enters the}} warehouse room in which the <b>Cybernaut</b> has cornered Mrs Peel, and tells Mrs Peel to throw him the pen. Another <b>Cybernaut</b> (the first with a [...] "brain of its own") arrives with Armstrong. Steed plants the pen on the second <b>Cybernaut</b> and they attack each other and accidentally kill Armstrong as he attempts to stop his robots. Roger, the first <b>Cybernaut,</b> then destroys the other by smashing its [...] "brain" [...] out of its head and destroys the pen. Having completed its mission it becomes inert, and Mrs. Peel pushes it over with a finger.|$|E

The <b>Cybernaut</b> is {{programmed}} via computer to home in on a radio transmitter concealed in the gadget pen given to Steed - the same method used to kill Hammond, Lambert and Jephcott. But Steed's pen is {{in the possession of}} Mrs Peel, so the <b>Cybernaut</b> will attack her rather than Steed. Dr. Armstrong discovers Steed is an intruder in the building when the thermostat in the factory is altered. Steed attempts to phone Mrs Peel to warn her but, before the <b>Cybernaut</b> arrives, she leaves her flat to look for him at United Automation as Steed has not returned at the pre-arranged time. Steed is then attacked by another <b>Cybernaut</b> in the factory and presented to Armstrong.|$|E

5000|$|The {{episode is}} {{generally}} considered {{to be one of the}} best of the fourth series and eventually resulted in two sequels. Return of the <b>Cybernauts</b> in September 1967, starred Peter Cushing as Armstrong's revengeful brother, with Frederick Jaeger returning as his assistant Benson. The New Avengers episode The Last of the <b>Cybernauts...?</b> followed in 1976. Jeffrey S. Miller described the episode as [...] "a tale of industrial intrigue, with several business executives being violently dispatched by someone of apparently superhuman strength." [...] The Encyclopedia of Super Villains describes the <b>Cybernauts</b> as [...] "powerful androids with silvery skin and blank expressions". The 1998 film The Avengers pays homage to the episode with Uma Thurman playing Dr. Peel, a jujitsu expert and specialist in meteorology, [...] "battling a clone duplicate of herself".|$|R
50|$|An {{internaut}} is online savvy, typically {{through years}} of online experience, with a thorough {{knowledge of how to}} use search engines, Internet resources, forums, newsgroups and chat rooms to find information. The more someone knows about the Internet, its history and politics, the more likely the term internaut fits them. The less he or she knows the more likely a different term would be more fitting. Other terms roughly analogous with internaut are <b>cybernaut</b> and netizen, though each has its own connotation. The common thread among them in English is an implication of experience and knowledge of the Internet or cyberspace that goes beyond the casual user. The French, however, use the term to describe any Internet user.|$|E
5000|$|Escape from Samsara - {{the name}} being a {{reference}} to the Hindu concept of Saṃsāra - held its first event at The Fridge on 15 September 1995. Formed from the club Megatripolis, they also held occasional events at the Brixton Academy & Bagleys in London; Spain, Morocco, Germany, Czech Republic, Egypt, Israel and Australia. The resident DJs at their events were Beamish and Oberon and there was usually a live performance by an electronic music artist or group, the most frequent appearances being by <b>Cybernaut,</b> Lab 4, The Secret and Audio Pancake. The upstairs balcony area was home to a market which sold fluoro clothing accessories, chai tea, etc. Also noteworthy is the admission and pricing policy where clubbers paid only £3 for entry (compared to the standard price of £10 or more) if they brought a [...] "drum or didge", thus encouraging punters to contribute musically and supporting those who could not afford the full price. Escape From Samsara then went on to run every Friday night {{for a number of years}} at The Fridge with DJs such at Rubec, Tim Samsara, Darren Shambhala, Chris Liberator, Mark EG, Blu Peter and Mark Sinclair all playing behind the decks. Escape From Samsara became a world-renowned brand that was known for its extraordinary friendly ambience, non profit ethos, whacky performers, free bananas at the end of the night, stunning decorations, giant balloons, confetti drops and pyrotechnic shows. For many it was an introduction into an alternative lifestyle.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe World Wide Web (or Internet) implies from {{few years}} {{different}} uses. Each <b>cybernaut</b> wants, {{on the same}} medium, to retrieve information, to make shopping, to manage his/her bank accounts, etc. Customers or users want more and more features from the web. In order to realize services with high quality, to evaluate them or simply to design well a website, {{we want to know}} how surf or browse a user. Web usage mining is the field that deals with this kind of problems: automatically extract information about users, and then build knowledge about web usage or learn user behavior. In this paper we present a first required step which is the data pre-processing, with a small discussion about different kind of data can be accessible from the internet. Also, we develop our own session retrieving process and we show that structural model as automata can be easily used in a short task of usage prediction. Then, we carry out a set of experiments which show how our pre-processing method can outperform results on artificial data.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the historical {{moment of the}} transition of the Internet from a technology to a cultural form with widespread social use. It is a moment that contains traces of the utopian dreams of the early users of the Internet at the point when it became a widely available, accessible everyday resource. I examine this moment of transition {{in terms of a}} vocabulary of use that sought to give expression to the then novel experience of being online. These conceptualisation of use are called user types and usually appear as metaphors. The first two chapters begin with metaphor, presented both in theory and in practice. This is followed by an introduction to cybercultural studies and cyberferninism, approaches which provide both inspiration and counterargument to the here presented approach. This framework is expanded in the fourth chapter, in which existing methodologies are outlined to introduce the virtual archaeology. This approach is inspired by the most important theoretical reference point for the thesis: Benjamin and his Arcades Project (and within that: cyberflAnerie). Benjamin's project emphasises the analysis of fragments, which are juxtaposed to illuminate an otherwise invisible meaning. Similar structures are seen to exist online. These shape the particularity of the creation of meaning. Another important aspect of Benjamin is his emphasis on the city and the radical shift of modernity. Each user type is seen to similarly express a reaction to the shock of the new, expressing particular utopian moments in Internet history. User types tell us something of the formation of discourses that complete the transformation of a technology from the technical into recognisable social and cultural identities. The user types analysed in detail are: the cyberflAneur, cyberfldneuse, webgrrl, cyberpunk, netizen, <b>cybernaut</b> and surfer. Their detailed analysis provides {{the second part of the}} thesis. The aspects referred to in the first part are all part of these analyses. Final reflections about the user types' role as specific communication tools, which shape the cultural form of the new medium, conclude the thesis.

5000|$|As {{a social}} experience, {{individuals}} can interact, exchange ideas, share information, provide social support, conduct business, direct actions, create artistic media, play games, engage in political discussion, and so on, using this global network. They are {{sometimes referred to}} as <b>cybernauts.</b> The term cyberspace has become a conventional means to describe anything associated with the Internet and the diverse Internet culture. The United States government recognizes the interconnected information technology and the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures operating across this medium as part of the US national critical infrastructure. Amongst individuals on cyberspace, there is believed to be a code of shared rules and ethics mutually beneficial for all to follow, referred to as cyberethics. Many view the right to privacy as most important to a functional code of cyberethics.

40|$|Undoubtedly, the {{technological}} revolution in information and communications causing {{major changes in}} citizens’ social interactions. The new reticular rationality offers the possibility of shaping, developing, and strengthening social networks and virtual communities. All of them facilitate {{the creation of new}} interactive spaces, new social collectives promoting citizenship and that, from different social fields and levels of experience, articulate and streamline processes of production, circulation and appropriation of new symbolic products. Such products contribute not only to generating new sources of knowledge but, above all, to strengthening processes of citizen interaction. In such processes, the field of media, religiosities and socio-cultural processes are strategically intertwined. In this context, experiences of civic religiosity find in the potential generated by the global network, new possibilities of interaction and religious recognition. Also new forms and spaces to share plural options of faith and socio-religious practices that make sense of the existence of <b>cybernauts.</b> This text is divided into three parts: First, critically contextualizes the global phenomenon of social networks. Second, it makes an approximation to some experiences of digital networks of religious recognition from Latin America. Finally, raises some questions that arise from such virtual practices...|$|R
