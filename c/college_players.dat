5|$|Over time, {{professional}} play {{became increasingly}} common, {{and with it}} came rising salaries and unpredictable player movement, {{as well as the}} illegal payment of <b>college</b> <b>players</b> who were still in school. The National Football League (NFL), a group of professional teams that was originally established in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association, aimed to solve these problems. This new league's stated goals included an end to bidding wars over players, prevention of the use of <b>college</b> <b>players,</b> and abolition of the practice of paying players to leave another team. By 1922, the NFL had established itself as the premier professional football league.|$|E

For the first time, junior <b>college</b> <b>players</b> would also {{be included in the}} June draft; in years past, teams would select junior <b>college</b> <b>players</b> in a separate draft.|$|E
