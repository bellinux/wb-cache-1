5000|$|The Unna (sometimes called [...] "Unna's") Boot {{itself is}} a {{compression}} dressing, usually made of cotton, that contains zinc oxide paste. The zinc oxide paste in the Unna Boot helps ease skin irritation and keeps the area moist. The zinc promotes healing within wound sites, making it useful for burns and ulcers. Zinc oxide paste is superior to gelatins used in other dressings, {{because it does not}} harden or cake. Some Unna Boots also contain calamine lotion and glycerin. For venous stasis ulcers, the paste-impregnated wrap is covered by an elastic layer, generally an elastic wrap ("ACE" [...] bandage) or self-adherent elastic bandage such as Coban; this is referred to as a 2-layer compression bandage. An alternative treatment is a 4-layer, graduated <b>compression</b> <b>wrap</b> (Pro-Fore is an example). Evidence indicates that both are equally effective in healing venous stasis ulcers — a slow process in the best of circumstances, often taking 2-6 months.|$|E
40|$|Compression {{therapy is}} a key {{component}} in the effective management of people with lower limb problems associated with venous, lymphatic and fat disorders such as lipoedema. Individuals with lymphoedema, venous ulceration and lipoedema often require long-term compression therapy to prevent and manage problems such as chronic ulceration and skin changes, persistent swelling and shape distortion.

Method: This audit was held within a 4 -week review period. Participants included venous leg ulcer (VLU) patients with and without oedema, and patients with lymphoedema. Where open wounds were present they were managed with debridement, skin care and dressings according to clinical need. Lymphoedema patients received manual lymphatic drainage and skin care regimens as per standard practice. The Velcro system evaluated formed part of a treatment pathway with compression bandages and/or compression hosiery as clinically indicated. Patients, carers and health-care professionals applied the garments following assessment and training. Objective data recorded included change in circumferential measurements and improvement in wound status. Observation of health-care professionals, patients and carers with regard to the comfort and ease of application/removal of the device were recorded.

50|$|Aside from use {{in sports}} {{medicine}} and by orthopedists, elastic bandages are {{popular in the}} treatment of lymphedema and other venous conditions. However, ACE <b>compression</b> <b>wraps</b> are inadequate for the treatment of lymphedema or chronic venous insuffiency. They provide a high resting compression and low active compression. A more appropriate use for compression in treating lymphedema or other edema conditions would be TG shapes, tensoshapes, compression socks or <b>compression</b> <b>wraps</b> for acute conditions or exacerbation.

40|$|NJURIES TO THE ankle {{are common}} {{at all levels}} of {{athletic}} participation. It is estimated that the ankle is the most frequently injured joint, accounting for 21 % of total injuries sustained (Mack, 1982). The degree and severity of an injury de-pends on the structures involved. Syndesmotic ankle-sprain incidence accounts for 1 – 11 % of all ankle injuries and requires a significant time to recover (Hopkinson, St. Pierre, Ryan, & Wheeler, 1990). Time to “return to full activity ” has been reported to range from 4 to 6 weeks (Boytim, Fischer, & Ryan, 1991). Research on time intervals relative to rehabilitation progression has not been fully examined. We reviewed 2 years of medi-cal records and have tracked syndesmotic ankle sprains at the University of Kentucky for the last 4 years. The purpose of our study was to establish a baseline for time required for a college football athlete to progress through common phases of rehabilitation and return to full participation after a syndesmotic ankle sprain. Management Over the 4 years, 14 syndesmotic ankle sprains oc-curred in 13 NCAA Division I football players. The acute phase of treatment included the first 0 – 5 days after injury. The primary acute management for each athlete was to immobilize the ankle in a Donjoy walk-ing boot (Figure 1; Dj Ortho, Vista, CA), combined with aircast support (Aircast, Summit, NJ) and com-pression wrap (Figure 2). The athlete was placed non-weight-bearing (on crutches) for 4. 15 ± 2. 19 days. Initial treatment also included RICE and active range of motion in the pain-free arcs. Stage 2 of the rehabilitation process began 6 – 10 days after injury and included strengthening and range-of-motion exercises.

40|$|Various {{forms of}} {{compression}} therapy have been utilized for centuries {{in the treatment}} of venous disease, with inelastic bandage systems being used in the more acute treatment of severe venous disease and elastic compression stockings used for long-term management of the disease. However, with the advancement in inelastic adjustable compression wraps, we now have the option to consider long-term management of venous disease with an inelastic system and not just elastic systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the hemodynamic effect of elastic compression stockings and inelastic compression wraps on venous disease patients when both products are applied to provide the same level of compression. Utilizing the APG device (ACI Medical, San Marcos, CA, USA), venous volumes, venous filling indexes and ejection fraction measurements were captured on 10 patients with varying degrees of venous disease. Measurements were obtained for each patient at baseline (without compression), with either 30 - 40 or 20 - 30 mmHg elastic compression stockings (ECS) and an inelastic <b>compression</b> <b>wrap</b> (ICW) (Juxta-CURES tm by Circaid Medical, San Diego, CA, USA). The compression level of the ECS was measured at the B 1 point utilizing a Picopress® [Microlab Elettronica Sas, Roncaglia di Ponte San Nicolò (PD), Italy] and the ICW was adjusted to provide the exact compression level as the ECS in order to compare the effects of inelasticity versus elasticity independent of compression differences. As expected, the use of compression therapy significantly improved all measures of hemodynamics although it was found that the ICW (average static stiffness 14. 3) further improved the measures over ECS (average static stiffness 2. 4). Average venous volumes were reduced over baseline with ECS by 19 % while ICW showed a reduction of 35 %. Average venous filling indexes were reduced with ECS by 25 % and 39 % with ICW. The ejection fractions for both devices, ECS and ICW, improved an average of 27 %. When applying the same compression level, the stiffness associated with ICW can further improve the venous hemodynamics of venous disease patients over ECS. For certain patients, using ICW could prove to be a significant benefit in the management of their disease...|$|E
40|$|While ice and <b>compression</b> <b>wraps</b> are {{commonly}} used to treat musculoskeletal injuries, the literature describing intramuscular temperatures has not addressed the combination of ice and <b>compression</b> <b>wraps.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate intramuscular temperatures at three sites on the anterior thigh (skin surface, 1 cm below the fat layer, and 2 cm below the fat layer) using both ice and <b>compression</b> <b>wraps.</b> Temperatures were recorded in 11 subjects with an isothermex, using implantable and surface thermocouples. Each subject was tested under four conditions: control, compression only, ice only, and ice + compression according to a balanced Latin square. Surface and intramuscular temperatures were recorded at 30 second intervals during 5 minutes of preapplication, 30 minutes application, and 20 minutes postapplication. A repeated measures ANOVA and Duncan post hoc tests were used to evaluate peak temperature differences between the treatment conditions and the depths of measurement. Both ice alone and ice + compression produced significant cooling at all three depths (F(6, 60) = 168. 5, p<. 0005). Likewise, during the 20 -minute postapplication period, these temperatures did not return to their preapplication levels. The compression-only condition produced significant warming at the skin surface, but did not have any effect on intramuscular temperature. At all depths, the ice + compression condition produced significantly cooler temperatures than ice alone. We suggest that compression increases the effectiveness of ice in reducing tissue temperatures. Therefore, ice combined with compression should be more effective than ice alone in reducing the metabolism of injured tissue. This provides an additional rationale for combining ice with compression in treating acute musculoskeletal injuries...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND / PURPOSE: The {{standard}} {{protocol for}} ambulating patients following split-thickness skin grafts {{to the lower}} extremity is an initial several days of immobilization. Research over the past decades supports a trend towards earlier ambulation, however burn clinics nation wide have been hesitant to implement such protocols. 1 The purpose of this literature review was to answer to the following PICO question: In adults with lower extremity split thickness skin grafts secondary to full-thickness burns, is early ambulation better than late ambulation in regards to preserving functional mobility while ensuring graft healing? CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 22 -year-old male with no significant past medical history, admitted for partial and full thickness flame burns to the posterior aspect of the left lower extremity covering approximately 4 % of his total body surface area. METHODS: An electronic search of the literature was performed with a critical appraisal of eight articles. Chosen studies compared early ambulation, defined as ≤ 3 days of bed rest, to late ambulation, defined as ≥ 4 days of bed rest, on graft healing. 2 OUTCOMES: There was a consensus in the literature supporting immediate ambulation of patients with isolated lower extremity burns. No studies of any patient population showed that early ambulation compromises graft take. CONCLUSION: Immediate ambulation is a safe intervention for patients who were previously ambulatory, are medically and psychologically stable, with wounds < 300 cm 2 that {{are not on the}} plantar surface of the foot. Ambulation is safe to begin once the patient recovers from anesthetic (4 to 48 hours post-op) with <b>compression</b> <b>wrapping</b> and splinting of any joints the graft crosses...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveWe {{describe}} and report our results using endoscopic vein harvest (EVH) for lower extremity arterial bypass procedures, following {{the implementation of}} technical modifications specific to patients undergoing limb salvage procedures. MethodsWe underwent training in EVH, followed by implementation of the technique in patients requiring limb salvage for lower extremity ischemia and aneurysms. After technical modifications in the technique were developed for limb salvage, we reviewed our experience in all patients who underwent minimally invasive distal bypass with EVH. ResultsTechnical modifications include limited arterial dissection before vein harvest, the use of proximal and distal leg incisions for both exposure of arterial vessels and saphenous vein harvest, improved hemostasis techniques in the vein graft tunnel, avoidance of <b>compression</b> <b>wraps</b> to the ipsilateral harvest tunnel, complete removal of the vein with either reversed or nonreversed graft placement, {{and use of the}} endoscopic tunnel for conduit placement. Thirteen patients (14 limbs) have undergone minimally invasive distal bypass since technical modifications were implemented. Indications for EVH were rest pain (n = 12; 85. 7 %) and tissue loss (n = 8; 57. 1 %). Veins harvested were the ipsilateral great saphenous vein (n = 10; 71. 4 %), contralateral great saphenous vein (n = 2; 14. 3 %), and short saphenous vein (n = 2; 14. 3 %). No venous injuries occurred during endoscopic harvest, and all were used for bypass. Thirty-day primary and primary assisted patency rates were 85. 7 % and 92. 9 %, respectively. The limb salvage rate was 100 %. Two patients developed postoperative hematomas, one early and one late, as a result of anticoagulation for cardiac comorbidities. Both patients required reoperation for successful re-establishment of patency. There were no perioperative deaths and no postoperative wound infections or complications. Two patients required a later prosthetic bypass, and two required a vein graft angioplasty. Complete wound healing was achieved in 75 % of patients with preoperative tissue loss. ConclusionsTechnical modifications in endoscopic saphenous vein harvest techniques facilitate their use in lower extremity limb salvage procedures. Vascular surgeons should become familiar with these techniques to minimize vein harvest wound complications and extend the options for limb salvage conduits, including use of both the ipsilateral and contralateral saphenous vein and the short saphenous vein. Meticulous hemostasis within the tunnel after endoscopic conduit harvest and avoidance of postoperative anticoagulation should help to prevent postoperative hematoma formation and early graft occlusion...|$|R
50|$|Compression therapies {{are finding}} more use {{as of the}} last ten years. The {{greatest}} issue with KTS syndrome is that the blood flow and/or lymph flow may be impeded, and will pool in the affected area. This can cause pain, swelling, inflammations, and in some cases, even ulceration and infection. Among older children and adults, compression garments {{can be used to}} alleviate almost all of these, and when combined with elevation of the affected area and proper management, can result in a comfortable lifestyle for the patient without any surgery. Compression garments are also used lately after a debulking procedure to maintain the results of the procedure. For early treatment of infants and toddlers with KTS, custom compression garments are impractical because of the rate of growth. When children may benefit from <b>compression</b> therapies, <b>wraps</b> and lymphatic massage may be used. While compression garments or therapy are not appropriate for everyone, they are relatively cheap (compared to surgery), and have few side-effects.

Experimental study: LD was conditioned in four pigs for three weeks before Fontan connection by valved conduit wrapped with LD. Mock circuit: Inflatable cuff wrapped around valved conduit provided intermittent external compression, with pressure and flow measured at driving pressure of 8 or 16 mmHg. CFD study: A circuit was tested for possible increase above basal flow (4 l/min) with intermittent external compression. Experimental study: Intermittent conduit compression by LD provided mean 7 % decrease of baseline PA pressure, with simultaneous flow increase of 2 %. Mock circuit: By raising the driving pressure from 8 to 16 mmHg, the flow increased with baseline PVR (56 %) and with elevated PVR (80 %). Total pulmonary flow was reduced during intermittent external compression with both baseline and elevated PVR. CFD study: Compression with 13. 0 mmHg provided 4. 9 % increase of total pulmonary flow with substantial increase of the peak flow (92 %). In vivo and in vitro, the increased flow produced by compressing a conduit was confounded by the inevitable intermittent flow restriction.

40|$|Hypothesis: The {{creation}} of positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic operations {{can lead to}} adverse hemodynamic changes, mainly decreased cardiac output. We hypothesized that pneumatic compression sleeves worn on the legs during pneumoperitoneum could abolish the pressure gradient between the abdominal cavity and the legs and so eliminate these adverse hemodynamic changes. Design Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with an additional calibration group. Setting A regional referral center. Patients Forty-five consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy who developed hemodynamic changes on induction of positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum were randomized to 3 groups. Interventions Low-pressure, nonsequential pneumatic <b>compression</b> sleeves, <b>wrapped</b> around the legs, were used to equilibrate the pressure gradient in the study group and to gradually exceed it in the calibration group. In the control group, no sleeves were used. Main Outcome Measures Transesophageal Doppler cardiac output, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance were monitored noninvasively. Results: The {{creation of}} positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum caused a significant decrease of cardiac output and stroke volume and increased systemic vascular resistance. In the experimental groups of patients, pressurizing the sleeves to the pneumoperitoneal pressure caused a significant increase of cardiac output (from 4. 82 to 6. 74 L/min), increased stroke volume, and decreased systemic vascular resistance (P<. 001). This was not seen in the control group. Additional gradual pressure increase in the sleeves of the calibration group produced no further improvement. Releasing the pressure abolished the hemodynamic advantages. Conclusions: Applying pressure on the legs equivalent to the positive-pressure pneumoperitoneum improves hemodynamic performance during pneumoperitoneum by nullifying the pressure gradient {{that is responsible for}} the adverse consequences. This might be of major practical value, especially for cardiac patients undergoing prolonged laparoscopic operations...|$|R

After material reaches to the black hole with the high angular momentum, the disk is formed inside a surface of weak shock. The disk becomes in a quasi-steady state for stars whose magnetic field is less than 10 10 G before the collapse. We find that the jet can be driven by the magnetic fields even if the central core does not rotate as rapidly as previously assumed and outer layers of the star has sufficiently high angular momentum.

40|$|Introduction: There is {{disagreement}} regarding whether, when possible, the {{rotator cuff}} should be repaired {{in conjunction with}} reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). Therefore, we investigated the effects of rotator cuff repair in RTSA models with varying magnitudes of humeral and glenosphere lateralization. Methods: Six fresh frozen cadaveric shoulders were tested on a validated in vitro muscle-driven motion simulator. Each specimen was implanted with a custom adjustable, load-sensing RTSA after creation of a simulated rotator cuff tear. The effects of 4 RTSA configurations (0 and 10 mm of humeral lateralization and glenosphere lateralization) on deltoid force and joint load during abduction with and without rotator cuff repair were assessed. Results: Deltoid force was significantly affected by increasing humeral lateralization (- 2. 5 % ± 1. 7 % body weight [BW], P =. 016) and glenosphere lateralization (+ 7. 7 % ± 5. 6 % BW, P =. 016). Rotator cuff repair interacted with humeral and glenosphere lateralization (P =. 005), such that with no humeral lateralization, glenosphere lateralization increased deltoid force without cuff repair (8. 1 % ± 5. 1 % BW, P =. 012). This effect was increased with cuff repair (12. 8 % ± 7. 8 % BW, P =. 010), but the addition of humeral lateralization mitigated this effect. Rotator cuff repair increased joint load (+ 11. 9 % ± 5. 1 % BW, P =. 002), as did glenosphere lateralization (+ 13. 3 % ± 3. 7 % BW, P <. 001). These interacted, such that increasing glenosphere lateralization markedly increased {{the negative effects of}} cuff repair (9. 4 % ± 3. 2 % BW [. P =. 001] vs. 14. 4 % ± 7. 4 % BW [. P =. 005]). Conclusion: Rotator cuff repair, especially in conjunction with glenosphere lateralization, produces an antagonistic effect that increases deltoid and joint loading. The long-term effects of this remain unknown; however, combining these factors may prove undesirable. Humeral lateralization improves joint <b>compression</b> through deltoid <b>wrapping</b> and increases the deltoid's mechanical advantage, and therefore, could be used in place of rotator cuff repair, thus avoiding its complications...|$|R
