40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} {{the resilience of}} cyber physi-cal systems by modeling the interaction between provider and attacker as a simultaneous game that incorporates <b>cyber</b> and physical <b>spaces.</b> Both the provider and at-tacker aim to maximize their individual utility, which is determined by a trade-off between target revenue and investment cost. The system resilience function is formulated as a power-form product of the survival probabilities of <b>cyber</b> and physical <b>spaces,</b> each with a corresponding correlation coefficient. The contest success functions based on the reinforcement and attack levels are used to estimate the survival probabilities of <b>cyber</b> and physical <b>spaces.</b> We present the provider strategies based on the Nash equilibrium of the game, and analyze the sensitivities with respect to cyber and physical correlation coefficients, target revenues and costs. The results show that these correlation coefficients affect the cyber and physical reinforcement strategies, and also provide {{new insights into the}} system resilience. I...|$|R

However, how to store relevant information related to trust, while offering the ac- cess to it to the OSNs' users, is rarely discussed in the literature. To address some of the current limitations, we introduce a novel approach that exploits the Semantic Web and especially the FOAF ontology. In fact, using the semantics of the FOAF ontology and applying Seman- tic Web reasoning techniques, we show that trust relationships can be merged between different users from multiple social network...|$|R

At {{the same time that}} people in these movements have felt the negative effects of globalization, they have also benefited from certain recent technological developments associated with globalization, especially “technoscapes” and “mediascapes” that have launched the “local” discourse of Revolutionary nationalism across borders and onto the world stage through a variety of national and international (<b>cyber)</b> <b>spaces,</b> creating transnational heterotopias or “other spaces” for cultural and political expression that transgress national boundaries. Analyzing examples of Zapata imagery from the post-revolutionary era (1920 s– 1930 s) against the neo-Zapatista movement of the 1990 s and 2000 s and the 2006 migrant protests in the United States, the paper explores {{the ways in which the}} formation of transnational “imagined communities” can destabilize traditional concepts of the nation-state...|$|R
