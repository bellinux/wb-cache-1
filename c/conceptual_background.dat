When asked to describe the album in three words, he stated {{that it was a}} [...] "path of exploration". Bassist Jeff Caxide has revealed that Turner noted Carl Jung as a major influence on the concept and lyrics. Jung's 1961 work, Memories, Dreams, Reflections, served as a specific source of inspiration for Turner, as he noted on his blog in a post preceding the album's release. Beyond Jung, he has spoken of how the album is closely related to dreams, and that he had been keeping a dream journal during the album's compositional phase. He gave up smoking marijuana in 2008, which he says enabled him to remember his dreams more clearly and, according to J. Bennett, [...] "tap into an internal consciousness". All of the album's official lyrics, deemed almost entirely indecipherable, [...] were revealed in celebration of the album's first anniversary.|$|E

Particular attention is given to the interaction between rural and urban landscapes.

In doing so the aim is not to justify or critique any particular biblical or philosophical perspective on divine hiddenness but simply to identify and clarify some crucial differences in various relevant <b>conceptual</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: By way of pointing out a number of similarities and differences between concepts of divine hiddenness in the theologies of the Hebrew Bible and in a specific formulation thereof in analytic philosophy of religion, this article not only reveals some neglected specifics of the historical variability of an important theological idea but also suggests taking caution when appealing to alleged biblical precursors to contemporary philosophical-theological problems. </p...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} an approach for structured reflection by a designer through journal writing. The journal writing situates {{the agency of}} the designer, using a range of internal conversations {{as a way to}} expand horizons and perspectives. Through a structured approach using journal entries, experiences of the design process are introduced as reflective internal talkback. In the approach that is described, decision points and perspectives are negotiated and potentially contested through a series of voices of self as I, Me, You, and We. These voices are intertwined within the journal narrative and are proposed as a useful framework for negotiating and effectively engaging with design complexity. The article introduces the <b>conceptual</b> <b>backgrounds</b> with reference to conversation as a process of learning. The specific dynamics of the journal writing approach are explained and then illustrated in a case study. The case study describes how the approach is applied for a specific design project...|$|R
40|$|Models in land change {{research}} are often chosen arbitrarily based on practical rather than theoretical considerations. More specifically, research on land change is {{often based on}} a research framework with three crucial elements - driving forces, actors, and land change - in an ad hoc and case-specific configuration. The lack of solid and widely applicable concepts about the conceptual link between these three elements can negatively affect individual research projects and hamper communication and generalizations beyond the individual project. We present four basic models for linking land change with driving forces and actors. These models are illustrated with examples from the research literature. Based on the main characteristics of the models and practical considerations, we propose guidelines for choosing among the four models for specific studies. More generally, we want to raise awareness that land change research is especially demanding with respect to <b>conceptual</b> <b>backgrounds</b> and that <b>conceptual</b> considerations will help improve the scientific quality of individual studies {{as well as their}} potential contribution towards generic theories of land change...|$|R

However, adequate clinical use of pedobarographic technology requires a profound technical and methodological knowledge. Several papers summarized the technical capacities of pedobarographic technology. Moreover, methodological expertise has grown considerably {{during the last two}} decades. Therefore, two crucial decisions have to be made before pathomechanical modelling or functional interpretation of foot and lower limb disorders can be pursued.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 84 - 93). Postmodern discourse {{is still the}} dominant factor in the 21 st century art production. On the other hand, there have appeared a number of alternative concepts which suggest that the influence of postmodern tendencies on art is diminishing, becoming unable to meet today's realities, or transforming altogether. The common ground among these new concepts is that they postulate a partial return to modernist tendencies such as creativity, originality, and/or uniqueness, without denying the achievements of postmodernism such as deconstruction, open-endedness or interaction, thus creating an oscillation. The thesis aims to examine a selection of recent new media works which are all connected with these new tendencies {{in one way or}} another, based on their <b>conceptual</b> <b>backgrounds</b> and/or their aesthetic approach in relation to the evolution of new media. While investigating these artworks by case study approach, the thesis claims that these artworks can be taken as indicators of a new understanding in arts. by İlker Çelen. M. S...|$|R

[...] In both Hebrews and Qumran a priestly figure is discussed {{in the context of}} a Davidic figure; in both cases a divine decree appoints the priests to their eschatological duty; both priestly figures offer an eschatological sacrifice of atonement.

40|$|KM {{is making}} its way among the more {{established}} branches of business management. Thus, the contribution that can come from an “economic reading” of KM practices can not be neglected. To systematise the <b>conceptual</b> <b>backgrounds</b> and to improve the formal modelling, a more direct connection with the models and approaches of the economic disciplines would be useful, but KM and Economics have often been two too distant areas. Recently, the attention to the economic models by KM researchers has increased. On the other hand, {{a growing number of}} economists has shown interest in the emerging field of the "Knowledge Economy", that focuses on the knowledge as an explicit object of the economic analysis. From these converging efforts, useful elements for the conceptual systematisation of KM can arise, and can give theoretical robustness to both the practice and the research. In the light of this, the chapter examines the contribution that the current studies of the Knowledge Economy can give to the clearer understanding of KM and, particularly, of Knowledge Transfer processes that are a central element of KM. The open research questions that may result from such an "economics-based" approach to KM are also analysed...|$|R

Modifying freely the way Wittgenstein (1921) expressed this important Kantian (1781) {{point on the}} limiting power of concepts on one’s thinking, the concepts that human– technology interaction designers of different scientific backgrounds use differ from each other and, consequently, they are apt to solve the same tasks in different ways.

Thus programmers have a different view of users than do psychologists or sociologists. Just as a lay person can understand little about ventricular tachycardia and cannot ask meaningful questions concerning this phenomenon, so an interaction designer with little psychological knowledge cannot know deeply the relevance of the Big 5 personality traits in interaction design.
