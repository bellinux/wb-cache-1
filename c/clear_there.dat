5|$|Below the Chief of Staff, {{the current}} {{organisation}} of the FARDC {{is not fully}} <b>clear.</b> <b>There</b> {{is known to be}} a Military Intelligence branch - Service du Renseignement militaire (SRM), the former DEMIAP. The FARDC is known to be broken up into the Land Forces (Forces Terrestres), Navy and Air Force. The Land Forces are distributed around ten military regions, up from the previous eight, following the ten provinces of the country. There is also a training command, the Groupement des Écoles Supérieurs Militaires (GESM) or Group of Higher Military Schools, which, in January 2010, was under the command of Major General Marcellin Lukama. The Navy and Air Forces are composed of various groupments (see below). There is also a central logistics base.|$|E
5|$|Control of the {{building}} project passed from the Scottish Office to the cross-party Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) on 1 June 1999, headed by the Parliament's then Presiding Officer, Sir David Steel, {{at a time of}} increasing costs. Rising costs sprang from the need for a formal entrance and the need to accommodate parliamentary staff in light of better knowledge of how Parliament was working at its primary location on the Royal Mile, where it was <b>clear</b> <b>there</b> were staff overcrowding problems. With the cost increases in mind, and heightened media interest in the Holyrood Project, the Members of the Scottish Parliament held a debate on whether to continue with construction on 17 June 1999 voting by a majority of 66 to 57 in favour to complete the project.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the reasons}} for the {{relationship}} are not <b>clear,</b> <b>there</b> also exists a relationship between procrastination and eveningness; that is, those who procrastinate more are more likely to go to sleep later and wake later. It is known that conscientiousness increases across the lifespan, as does morningness. Procrastination too decreases with age. However, even controlling for age, there still exists a relationship between procrastination and eveningness, which is yet to be explained.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} how all {{peptides}} that influence hypothalamic activity gain the necessary access. In the case of prolactin and leptin, there is evidence of active uptake at the choroid plexus from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Some pituitary hormones have a negative feedback influence upon hypothalamic secretion; for example, growth hormone feeds back on the hypothalamus, but how it enters the brain is not <b>clear.</b> <b>There</b> is also evidence for central actions of prolactin.|$|E
25|$|Two screens {{divided the}} length of the church: a rood screen and a pulpitum. Only the {{footings}} of both survive, although they are very <b>clear.</b> <b>There</b> are also foundations of two nave altars against the pulpitum. Beyond the screens, the chancel and presbytery are the oldest parts of the building, begun in the later 12th century. The only major subsequent alteration was the insertion of a large and impressive east window in the 14th century. This still dominates the church, as it was intended to do.|$|E

When the wage is fixed, however, the labor markets do not <b>clear.</b> Thus, <b>there</b> are labor shortages, deadweight loss, and economic inefficiency. The labor shortages create a supply constraint in the output markets and prevent those markets from <b>clearing.</b> Thus, <b>there</b> is deadweight loss in those markets as well.|$|R

25|$|Snooker {{remained}} a huge attraction at this time, and crowds filled Blackpool Tower Circus to see Davis beat Donaldson 84–61 in the 1948 final and 80–65 in the 1949 final. However times were changing, and from 1950 matches became shorter. Donaldson beat Davis {{for the last}} time to win the 1950 title, 51–46. When Davis won the 1954 event with a 39–21 victory over Donaldson, it was <b>clear</b> <b>there</b> was a decline in interest as only five players entered the championship; Donaldson then retired.|$|E
25|$|NEDD4 {{has been}} shown to {{interact}} with and ubiquitinate the tumour suppressor protein PTEN in vitro, resulting in PTEN proteasomal degradation or trafficking. The in vivo role of NEDD4 in PTEN regulation is less <b>clear.</b> <b>There</b> is some evidence from NEDD4 deficient mice that NEDD4 does not target PTEN for degradation or trafficking. However, in other in vivo models, and in many human cancer cell lines, NEDD4 does appear responsible for the degradation of PTEN. NEDD4 regulation of PTEN may only occur in specific biological contexts.|$|E

25|$|The {{biography}} of Anthony's life by Athanasius of Alexandria helped {{to spread the}} concept of Christian monasticism, particularly in Western Europe via its Latin translations. He is often erroneously considered the first Christian monk, but as his biography and other sources make <b>clear,</b> <b>there</b> were many ascetics before him. Anthony was, however, {{the first to go}} into the wilderness (about 270), a geographical move that seems to have contributed to his renown. Accounts of Anthony enduring supernatural temptation during his sojourn in the Eastern Desert of Egypt inspired the often-repeated subject of the temptation of St. Anthony in Western art and literature.|$|E

Unfortunately, at this moment, Imogen enters and sees Dan sitting at a table, flowers resting there, talking to another woman. Imogen leaves distraught.

25|$|The precise {{effect of}} the food crisis on German health and {{mortality}} has {{been a matter of}} some contention. Speaking of the Anglo-American zones, Herbert Hoover reported that in the fall of 1946, starvation produced a 40 percent increase in mortality among Germans over 70. However, John Farquharson cites statistics indicating that the incidence of hunger oedema was low in 1946–1947. According to the British Medical Journal, mortality in the British zone was above its pre-war level until June, 1946, when the death rate fell below that of 1938. Also, once it became <b>clear</b> <b>there</b> would be no rising, as threatened by the Nazis during the war, food controls were relaxed.|$|E
25|$|After the {{round-robin}} play, 4 {{teams were}} {{tied for the}} last playoff spot, and defending champion of the last 4 years, Colleen Jones was eliminated in her first tie-breaker match against New Brunswick's Sandy Comeau who would later lose to Jenn Hanna of Ontario. As Colleen Jones was eliminated, it had become <b>clear</b> <b>there</b> was {{a new era in}} Canadian women's curling, and that was of youth. Three of the four playoff teams were former national junior champions (Lawton in 2001, Jennifer Jones in 1994 and Scott in 1995), and the other was a runner-up (Hanna in 1998). In the end, it was Jennifer Jones over Hanna, in a very close game that came to the very last shot.|$|E
25|$|The {{process whereby}} the {{indigenous}} population of 'Wales' came {{to think of themselves}} as Welsh is not <b>clear.</b> <b>There</b> is plenty of evidence of the use of the term Brythoniaid (Britons); by contrast, the earliest use of the word Kymry (referring not to the people but to the land—and possibly to northern Britain in addition to modern day territory of Wales) is found in a poem dated to about 633. The name of the region in northern England now known as Cumbria is derived from the same root. Only gradually did Cymru (the land) and Cymry (the people) come to supplant Brython. Although the Welsh language was certainly used at the time, Gwyn A. Williams argues that even at the time of the erection of Offa's Dyke, the people to its west saw themselves as Roman, citing the number of Latin inscriptions still being made into the 8th century. However, it is unclear whether such inscriptions reveal a general or normative use of Latin as a marker of identity or its selective use by the early Christian Church.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems likely}} that the Loddon was used for {{navigation}} in the past, although the details are not <b>clear.</b> <b>There</b> is circumstantial evidence in the naming of Barge Lane, which runs beside the river at Swallowfield, and of some of the pools by the mills. The pools at Arborfield Mill and Sindlesham Mill are both called Lock Pool. More concrete evidence is provided by the number of boat houses marked on old maps, including two on the Arborfield estate, one of which still exists, one near Mill Lane at Sindlesham, and another at Woodley, near to Colmansmoor Lane. Other evidence includes postcards in the collection at Reading Local Studies Library, which show a punt at Twyford and rowing boats at Sindlesham Mill and Arborfield Hall. Old postcards also show that The George public house at Winnersh used to have rowing boats on the river available for hire. There was a boathouse on the opposite bank to the public house, one of eleven on the river around the 1900s.|$|E
