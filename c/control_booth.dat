5|$|The {{new show}} {{transformed}} Iron Dragon midway {{into a new}} area called Celebration Plaza. The area features curved edges. A new entrance and queueing area was built for Iron Dragon because the new stage occupies the old queue and entrance area. The control booths used for American Portrait were relocated {{to the side of}} the midway. On May 2, 2012 it was announced that WildCat would be removed before opening day to expand Celebration Plaza and bleachers were added in its spot. A new concession area with patio seating was built on the left side of the <b>control</b> <b>booth.</b> During the show, a portion of the patio is blocked off as a V.I.P. seating area known as the Pepsi Fan Zone. In addition, a beer garden was added behind the <b>control</b> <b>booth,</b> to the left of the bleachers.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Star Trek films, existing props and footage were reused where possible to save money, though The Voyage Home required less of this than previous films. The Earth Spacedock interiors and <b>control</b> <b>booth</b> sets were reused from The Search for Spock, although the computer monitors in these scenes featured new graphics—the old reels had deteriorated in storage. Stock {{footage of the}} destruction of the Enterprise and the Bird-of-Prey's movement through space were reused. While the Bird-of-Prey bridge was a completely new design, other parts of the craft's interior were also redresses; the computer room was a modification of the reactor room where Spock died in The Wrath of Khan. After all other Bird-of-Prey bridge scenes were completed, the entire set was painted white for one shot that transitioned into a dream sequence during the time travel.|$|E
5|$|On March 20, Parker sent a {{chartered}} Greyhound bus {{to transport}} Presley {{and his entourage}} from Memphis, Tennessee to Nashville. The session personnel consisted of guitarist Scotty Moore, drummer D.J. Fontana, pianist Floyd Cramer, guitarist Hank Garland, bassist Bobby Moore, percussionist Buddy Harman and the backing group The Jordanaires. Presley's original bassist Bill Black declined to join the sessions as he was enjoying success with the Bill Black Combo. To prevent possible disruption by fans, the musicians were initially told {{they were going to}} play on a Jim Reeves session. RCA executives Sholes and Bill Bullock were joined in the <b>control</b> <b>booth</b> by Parker, his assistant Tom Diskin, A head Chet Atkins, engineer Bill Porter and Hill and Range's Bienstock.|$|E

50|$|The booth {{contains}} {{a variety of}} equipment used {{in the production of}} theatrical performances. Although booths vary greatly from venue to venue, most booths contain a light board, and sometimes a sound board. Most <b>control</b> <b>booths</b> have at least one intercom headset used for communication with the backstage crew during performances. The booth may have equipment racks for the lighting and audio equipment.|$|R
25|$|On 13 August 2011, a 24-year-old ride {{operator}} {{was crushed}} by two trains at the Naudières theme park in Sautron, France. The man left the <b>control</b> <b>booth</b> {{of the ride}} whilst it was in motion. He slipped trapping his legs beneath the track and then {{was hit by a}} train, trapping him between two cars, crushing him beneath the ride's structure. Doctors amputated his legs at the scene, but he later died of his injuries. The park closed the next day due to 'very bad weather'.|$|E
500|$|... "Finally I {{caught him}} in Studio A of RCA. [...] He {{came out of the}} <b>control</b> <b>booth</b> and he had a couple of bikers - bikers hung around with him a lot, some pretty tough looking {{customers}} - and I'd had enough. [...] I just said, 'Hey Waylon!' [...] And he turned. [...] I said, 'I got these songs that you claimed you was gonna listen to, and if you don't listen to 'em I'm gonna whip your ass right here in front of everybody.' And boy, whew. [...] Man! [...] Everything got quiet and them old boys started formin' and Waylon stopped 'em. [...] He said, 'Hoss, you don't know how close you come to gettin' killed.' [...] I said, 'Well, I've had enough. [...] You done told me you was gonna do this. [...] Now I'm full of songs and I {{want you to listen to}} 'em." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, many young Puerto Rican men were drafted for World War II, among them Santos. Santos {{recorded}} [...] "Despedida" [...] (My Good-bye), a farewell song written by Flores {{from the viewpoint}} of an Army recruit who had to leave behind his girlfriend and his ailing mother, which became a hit. Santos recalled in an interview once that he had to hold back tears while recording the song, since his draft papers had just arrived and he would soon have to live a situation similar to what the song's lyrics described, but that a friend started mocking him at the <b>control</b> <b>booth,</b> to which he decided to curse him on the spot, trading the word mama'o (an expletive in Puerto Rican Spanish) for mamá (mother). This incident produced two mannerisms that Santos eventually adopted in his singing style: chopped delivery (almost syllable by syllable, as suggested by Flores) and stretched last vowel in the last verse of each stanza, in almost every song he recorded afterwards.|$|E
50|$|In {{some smaller}} theatres, and school halls <b>control</b> <b>booths</b> can {{sometimes}} be found above or {{at the side of}} the stage. This allows space at the back of the auditorium for more seating, or a better/larger foyer area.In older theatres, this is because before the advent of thyristor dimming and compact electronic control desks, there was a limit on the distance that lighting controls could be placed away from the dimmers.|$|R
500|$|The three-story stage runs {{parallel}} to the midway. The back of the stage is [...] high and the length is [...] long. Several screens are located on behind the main stage with two showing close-ups of the performers {{on the sides of}} the stage. The stage has video walls made of one-hundred twelve MVP 18 and thirty-seven MVP 37.5 modular video panels. Two screens are next to the <b>control</b> <b>booths</b> and bleachers.|$|R
50|$|In the Washington Bridge project, the {{eastbound}} {{bridge was}} replaced. This involved building {{a portion of}} the new bridge in the gap between the two structures, moving traffic to the new bridge, then demolishing the left lanes of the old bridge {{to make room for the}} right lanes of the new one. The old <b>control</b> <b>booths</b> for the bascule section have been removed. The new span is now complete. Part of the original eastbound structure is being preserved, and will be used as a bike and pedestrian route.|$|R
500|$|In {{the first}} round of its series four heat, Razer progressed {{alongside}} Robochicken from a three-way battle in which Velocirippa was eliminated. In its next battle against Milly-Ann Bug, Razer methodically removed all of its opponent's wheels, rendering Milly-Ann Bug unable to move. In a post-battle interview with host Craig Charles, Blood likened this attack to [...] "pulling the legs off a spider". Early on in its heat final against Pussycat, Razer malfunctioned. Stuck in forward drive, it careered into the arena side wall with the rear wheels spinning but unable to steer. Pussycat severely damaged the back end and wheels of Razer, until Dead Metal of the house robots pitted the machine. Although Scott and Blood were gracious in defeat, Lewis turned his back on the fight, left the <b>control</b> <b>booth</b> immediately afterwards, and refused to be interviewed by Craig Charles. Lewis accused the Pussycat team of breaking a gentlemen's agreement that both teams would not seriously damage the other's machine. However, Team Pussycat were unaware that Razer was immobilised. Razer also took part in the Pinball Warrior and Sumo Basho side tournaments of series four; its performances were underwhelming in both events, scoring 95 points in the former having abandoned the run partway through to attack Sir Killalot, and lasting less than five seconds in the latter.|$|E
500|$|The session, {{held the}} evening of July 5, 1954, proved entirely unfruitful {{until late in the}} night. As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and {{launched}} into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's [...] "That's All Right". Moore recalled, [...] "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the <b>control</b> <b>booth</b> open... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again.'" [...] Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for. Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played [...] "That's All Right" [...] on his WHBQ Red, Hot, and Blue show. Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black. During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe's [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", again in a distinctive style and employing an audio delay echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed [...] "slapback". A single was pressed with [...] "That's All Right" [...] on the A side and [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky" [...] on the reverse.|$|E

50|$|Terminal 2, {{opened in}} 3 phases {{respectively}} in 2006, 2007, and 2011, can serve up to 3.5 million passengers a year. The check-in hall {{is on the}} 2nd floor, under a very high glazed ceiling, and has 42 check-in desks in 2 piers, equipped with brand-new technology. Its boarding lounge include 8 gates: 5 via jetways, and 3 by bus; duty-free shops, a rest area {{in front of the}} 8 m full-glazed facade with a panoramic view over the tarmac and Mount Ararat, cafes, and a business lounge at the 4th floor. The security checkpoint has 16 passport <b>control</b> <b>booths,</b> and reliable X-ray machines.The arrival hall is first made by a glazed tunnel between the 2nd and the first floor, then escalators lead down to immigration <b>control</b> (15 <b>booths),</b> before passing through a large duty-free store, which opens on the baggage claim area (4 carousels). The public arrivals exit, linked with the departures level, contains cafes, banks and tourist desks. The outside of the terminal opens on the drop-off road, taxi station, and to the 3-floor parking garage.|$|R
2500|$|Pods may be {{designed}} for high-security [...] "indirect supervision", in which officers in segregated and sealed <b>control</b> <b>booths</b> monitor smaller numbers of prisoners confined to their cells. An alternative is [...] "direct supervision", in which officers {{work within the}} pod and directly interact with and supervise prisoners, who may spend the day outside their cells in a central [...] "dayroom" [...] {{on the floor of}} the pod. Movement in or out of the pod to and from exercise yards, work assignments or medical appointments can be restricted to individual pods at designated times and is generally centrally controlled. Goods and services, such as meals, laundry, commissary, educational materials, religious services and medical care can increasingly be brought to individual pods or cells as well.|$|R
50|$|Forward and {{backward}} {{may be defined}} by referring to an object's or person's motion. Forward {{is defined as the}} direction in which the object is moving. Backward is then defined as the opposite direction to forward. Alternatively, 'forward' may be the direction pointed by the observer's nose, defining 'backward' as the direction from the nose to the sagittal border in the observer's skull. With respect to a ship 'forward' would indicate the relative position of any object lying in the direction the ship is pointing. For symmetrical objects, it is also necessary to define forward {{and backward}} in terms of expected direction. Many mass transit trains are built symmetrically with paired <b>control</b> <b>booths,</b> and definitions of forward, backward, left, and right are temporary.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>control</b> <b>booth</b> {{is located}} above the Mexico Pavilion. [...] It houses {{emergency}} stop controls, and communications to each barge using wireless ethernet, and headset communication to the Globe barge driver. [...] All barges are wired with multi-core cables, and most functions within these cables have a redundant wireless backup. Show audio and announcements also originate from the booth.|$|E
2500|$|Saturday Night Live had no foreknowledge of O'Connor's plan; {{during the}} dress rehearsal, {{she held up}} a photo of a refugee child. NBC Vice-President of Late Night Rick Ludwin {{recalled}} that when he saw O'Connor's action, he [...] "literally jumped out of [...] chair." [...] SNL writer Paula Pell recalled personnel in the <b>control</b> <b>booth</b> discussing the cameras cutting away from the singer. The audience was completely silent, with no booing or applause; executive producer Lorne Michaels recalled that [...] "the air went out the studio". [...] Michaels ordered that the applause sign not be used.|$|E
2500|$|According to Bunk Gardner, [...] "Cruising with Ruben & the Jets {{was an easy}} {{album to}} record. We were {{recording}} {{it at the same}} time as Uncle Meat because the songs were easy and very simple and didn't require a lot of time for arrangements and technical overdubbing. It was the beginning of the end for Ray Collins because all the new material Frank was writing was a little too far out and away from Ray's roots - which was Ruben-era material. Motorhead too was in his glory during the recording of this album. He loved Ruben and that was really his kind of music to get nostalgic over - on stage and doing the dance steps and playing that music [...] I really enjoyed playing a solo on Ray's tune 'Anything'. I remember Frank, Ray and Roy standing in the <b>control</b> <b>booth</b> while I recorded my solo. Frank was telling me after the first take to keep it simple. So I nailed it on the second take and everyone was happy!" ...|$|E

5000|$|While {{en route}} to Central America, the Wichita met the Ranger {{off the coast of}} San Diego. During [...] "UNREP" [...] the next day, the Ranger {{collided}} with the Wichita causing extensive damage to two sets of the Wichitas kingposts, winch <b>control</b> <b>booths</b> and the aft superstructure. Later in the deployment, because of that damage, the Wichita spent 3 weeks in Subic Bay for repairs and was detached from the Ranger Battlegroup which continued on into the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. Shortly after the repairs at Subic Bay, the Wichita became the lead support ship in the search for the KAL-007 Korean airliner that was shot down and spent 45 days at sea, searching off the coast of northern Japan.|$|R

50|$|Terminal C cost an {{estimated}} US$87.7 million to construct. It has 40000 m2 of floorspace {{and has a}} capacity of 5 million passengers per year. The terminal now tends to handle flights of CIS carriers and charter airlines. On March 12, 2007, Sheremetyevo opened its first entirely new-build terminal for the servicing of international flights. Located {{in the northern part}} of the airport and adjacent to Terminal B, it has 30 check-in counters, 36 passport <b>control</b> <b>booths,</b> a three-level automatic baggage sorting system, and six air bridges. Terminal C is connected by way of an elevated pedestrian gallery with a multistory parking facility for 1,000 vehicles. In autumn 2008, an orthodox chapel (of Archangel Michael and the other Bodiless) was opened on the terminal's third (departures) floor. Terminal C will close on April 1, 2017 for renovation works and will then become integrated with the new Terminal B.|$|R
50|$|It {{stretches}} over 65.800 {{square metres}} on three levels featuring three baggage carousels, 8 air bridges, 9 security checkpoints, 30 check-in desks, 23 passport <b>control</b> <b>booths</b> {{and a car}} park with the capacity of 1.100 vehicles. Furthermore the new apron has three remote stands next to the terminal, while 23 stands at the old passenger building are also used during the peak season. Each of the aircraft parking positions at the facility includes a visual docking guidance system which gives information to a pilot on how to park their aircraft. The terminal itself features a large 600 square metre duty-free shop operated by Aelia, 16 cafés, bars, restaurants and snack bars. Enough space has been left for 30 additional check-in counters and 2 baggage carousels to be added once the new terminal reaches its current maximum capacity of 5 million passengers. Further extensions envisaged along the thirty-year concession period will potentially see expanding current apron from present 100 000sqm to 300 000sqm and terminal capacity increased to eight million through gradual expansion of the terminal in four Phase 2 expansions.|$|R

50|$|Both {{black and}} white and colour photo booths are common in the US, however in Europe the colour photo booth has almost entirely {{replaced}} {{black and white}} booths. However, newer digital booths now offer the customer the option of whether to print in colour or in black and white. Most modern photo booths use video or digital cameras instead of film cameras, and are under computer <b>control.</b> Some <b>booths</b> can also produce stickers, postcards, or other items with the photographs on them, rather or as well as simply a strip of pictures. These often include an option of novelty decorative borders around the photos.|$|R
