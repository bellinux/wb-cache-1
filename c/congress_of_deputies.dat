Politically, Badajoz belongs to the Spanish Congress Electoral District of Badajoz, which is the largest electoral district about of 52 districts in the Spanish <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deputies</b> in terms of geographical area and includes {{a significant part of the}} Extremadura region. The electoral district was first contested in modern times in the 1977 General Election.

In 2004, the nation's newly elected Socialist Party (PSOE) Government, led by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, began {{a campaign for}} its legalization, including the right of adoption by same-sex couples. After much debate, a law permitting same-sex marriage {{was passed by the}} Cortes Generales (Spain's bicameral Parliament, composed of the Senate and the <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deputies)</b> on 30 June 2005 and published on 2 July 2005.

5|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22, 1810; it was debated whether the viceroy should {{continue}} in office, and if not, who should replace him. The first opinion was from Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, who held that Cisneros should continue and that, if all of Spain was conquered by France, peninsulars were meant to rule in the Americas. Castelli made a counter-argument, based on {{the doctrine of the}} retroversion of the sovereignty of the people that he had already employed in the defense of Paroissien. He insisted that {{in the absence of a}} legitimate authority, sovereignty should be returned to the people; they should govern themselves. The idea of dismissing the viceroy ultimately prevailed, but as Buenos Aires had no authority to decide unilaterally the new form of government, they would elect a provisional government. A <b>congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>deputies</b> called from all other cities would take the final decision. However, there were disputes over who should exercise the provisional government: some argued that the Cabildo should do so, and others that it should be a Junta. Castelli bowed to Saavedra's proposal to form a Junta, but with the proviso that the procurator of the Cabildo, Julián de Leiva, had a decisive vote in the appointment. By adding this proviso, Castelli sought to add the former supporters of Martín de Álzaga, such as Mariano Moreno, Domingo Matheu, and Leiva himself.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish Cortes Generales were {{regarded}} as an imperfect bicameral system. The <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deputies</b> had greater legislative power than the Senate, having the ability to grant or revoke confidence from a Prime Minister and to override Senate vetoes by an absolute majority of votes. Nonetheless, the Senate possessed a few exclusive, yet limited in number functions—such as its role in constitutional amendment—which were {{not subject to the}} Congress' override. Voting for the Cortes Generales was on the basis of universal suffrage, with all nationals over eighteen and in full enjoyment of all political rights entitled to vote.|$|E
25|$|Despite Aznar's {{designation}} as PP candidate, {{the opposition}} remained divided and weak {{on the road}} to the 1989 election. This, coupled with a buoyant economy, made a new PSOE victory inevitable. The electoral campaign, thus, focused on whether the Socialists would be able to maintain their absolute majority on the <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deputies</b> for a third term in office. United Left had also appointed a new leader, Julio Anguita, and had high expectations to increase their parliamentary representation from the 7 seats they had won in 1986. During the campaign, Felipe González pledged that this would be the last time he would stand for the office of Prime Minister. He would eventually stand for two more elections, until 1996.|$|E

Additionally, {{the use of the}} D'Hondt method might result in an effective threshold over three percent, dependant on the district magnitude.

Ceuta and Melilla were allocated the two remaining seats, which were elected using plurality voting.|$|E

25|$|The 1989 Spanish general {{election}} {{was held on}} Sunday, 29 October 1989, to elect the 4th Cortes Generales of the Kingdom of Spain. All 350 seats in the <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deputies</b> were up for election, as well as 208 of 254 seats in the Senate. An election had not been due until 28 July 1990 at latest, but Prime Minister Felipe González called for a snap election nine months ahead of schedule, allegedly on the need of implementing tough economic measures. González hoped to capitalize on a still strong economy and his party's electoral success in a European Parliament election held in June, after a troubled legislature which had seen an increase of social protest on his government's economic policy and the calling of a massive general strike in 1988.|$|E
25|$|In 1893 Lloréns, one of {{the leading}} Levantine Carlists, got elected to the <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deputies</b> from Castellón as {{one of the}} first Traditionalist deputies of the Restoration era.

In 1896 he successfully ran from the Catalan Gerona and was re-elected from the same constituency in 1898. In 1899 the claimant Carlos VII decided not to field an official list permitting only individual candidatures, but Lloréns was engaged in staging insurgency rather than running for the parliament he just planned to overthrow.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} {{was regarded as}} one of the most controversial in the democratic history of Spain. Close results in many constituencies, coupled with severe flaws in electoral register data, an inefficient structure of the electoral administration and the ongoing political struggle between the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and the opposition parties over the Socialist absolute majority in the <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deputies,</b> led to a major scandal when election results in a number of constituencies were contested under accusations of irregularities and fraud. Judicial courts were forced to intervene, determining by-elections for Murcia, Pontevedra and Melilla. The issue was appealed to the Constitutional Court of Spain, which overruled previous rulings and voided the vote in Melilla only, with a new election being held on 25 March 1990. In the end, the disputed seat was won over by the People's Party (PP), depriving the PSOE from its 176th seat in Congress.|$|E

25|$|During the Franco years, marriages {{had to be}} {{canonical}} (that is, performed under Roman Catholic law and regulations) if {{even one}} of the partners was Catholic, which meant effectively that all marriages in Spain had to be sanctioned by the church. Since the church prohibited divorce, a marriage could be dissolved only through the arduous procedure of annulment, which was available only after a lengthy series of administrative steps and was thus accessible only to the relatively wealthy. These restrictions were probably one of the major reasons for a 1975 survey result showing that 71 percent of Spaniards favored legalizing divorce; however, because the government remained in the hands of conservatives until 1982, progress toward a divorce law was slow and full of conflict. In the summer of 1981, the <b>Congress</b> <b>of</b> <b>Deputies</b> (lower chamber of the Cortes Generales, or Spanish Parliament) finally approved a divorce law with the votes of about thirty Union of the Democratic Center (Union de Centro Democratico or UCD) deputies who defied the instructions of party conservatives. As a consequence, Spain had a divorce law that permitted the termination of a marriage in as little as two years following the legal separation of the partners. Still, it would be an exaggeration to say that the new divorce law opened a floodgate for the termination of marriages. Between the time the law went into effect at the beginning of September 1981, and the end of 1984, only slightly more than 69,000 couples had availed themselves of the option of ending their marriages, and the number declined in both 1983 and 1984. There were already more divorced people than this in Spain in 1981 before the law took effect.|$|E
