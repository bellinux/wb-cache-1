40|$|The {{electrochemical}} potential difference for each dissociation state of malic acid across the tonoplast of leaf cells was examined in two CAM plants, Graptopetalum paraguayense and Kalan-choe daigremontiana. The concentration of malic acid in each dissociation state was estimated from {{an analysis of}} pH and concentrations of ionic species that included <b>calcium,</b> <b>malate</b> and isocitrate. The vacuoles contained 30 - 40 mM isocitrate and 50 - 70 mM calcium in G. paragua-yense, and 20 - 30 mM isocitrate and 70 - 100 mM calcium in K. daigremontiana. For the calcu-lation of the pattern of dissociation of malic acid, the formation of chelates of calcium with malate and isocitrate, which have different stability constants depending on the dissociation of the acids, were also taken into consideration. The vacuolar concentrations of the divalently dissociated form of malic acid (mal 2 ~) were 4 - 7 mM and 1 - 3 mM in G. paraguayense and in K. daigremontiana, respectively. To obtain information about the cytoplasmic concentration of malate, the apparent inhibition constant for malate of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase was measured. It was about 330 fiM in the dark period and 60 ̂ M in the light period. Considering an inside-positive membrane potential, we conclude that mal 2 " can be taken up passively into the vacuole during the dark period and can be released passively from the vacuole during the light pe-riod. Two types of channel (the "SV-type " channel and a novel "MU-type " channel) which we found recently in G. paraguayense [Iwasaki et al.

40|$|Background: When usual calcium {{consumption}} patterns were analysed {{most people in}} the U. S. and Europe consume less than the recommended daily allowance. Supplements and fortified foods offer alternative and additional sources of calcium to traditional food. Calcium carbonate is the most common supplement but it is less soluble in water and, therefore, not suitable for enrichment of beverages. New organic calcium salts have a better solubility but less is known about their bioavailability. In the present study, we assessed the solubility and bioavailability of the new organic calcium salts, calcium lactate citrate and <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>malate,</b> in comparison to the traditional supplements, calcium carbonate and calcium gluconate. Design: Randomized, single-blind, four way cross-over study comparing single doses of 500 mg calcium in the form of four different calcium-salts. Subjects were advised to consume 25 µg vitamin D 3 daily two weeks {{prior to the start of}} the study and during the whole study period. Subjects: 20 healthy young men, Methods: Blood samples were drawn immediately before and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after ingestion of the calcium preparation. Concentration of total calcium and intact parathyroid hormone were measured in the serum. Urine was collected at baseline and during the intervals 0 - 3, 3 - 6, 9 - 15 and 15 - 24 h and excretion of calcium, sodium and creatinine was examined. Results: The tested new salts were easily water soluble, significantly better than calcium gluconate. Calcium carbonate is almost insoluble. The bioavailability of the four different calcium salts was found to be almost identical. The maximum total serum calcium increased by 7. 6 % two hours after ingestion calcium lactate citrate, by 7. 4 % after <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>malate,</b> by 5. 5 % after calcium carbonate, and by 5. 8 % after calcium gluconate. Intact parathyroid hormone concentration showed the expected depression for calcium lactate citrate, <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>malate</b> and <b>calcium</b> carbonate, whereas the serum level was significantly higher after ingestion of calcium gluconate. Conclusion: Given an almost equivalent bioavailability of the four tested calcium salts, we conclude that the new salts calcium lactate citrate and <b>calcium</b> lactate <b>malate</b> are well suited for fortification of beverages and thus to increase the average daily calcium intake...|$|R

5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: <b>calcium</b> citrate, <b>malate,</b> and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|R

40|$|Background Lactose {{intolerance}} is {{a common}} condition which individuals {{are not able to}} completely digest lactose. Each individual has varying degree of lactose intolerance varying level of symptoms experienced. Due to the symptoms of lactose intolerance, lactose intolerant individuals are likely to eliminate milk and dairy products from their diet. Actually, milk and other dairy products are the preferred food sources of calcium for most people. It is essential to maintain adequate calcium intake everyday for the proper growth and development of bones. Individuals who avoid milk and dairy products from diet may not meet the daily requirements for calcium. Therefore, the lactose intolerant individuals are at a higher risk of osteoporosis. Calcium supplementations are an alternative source of calcium for lactose intolerant individuals who have low calcium intake to meet their daily needs. Objectives This review is to assess the impacts and effect of calcium supplements on bone density and bone fracture risk in lactose intolerant individuals. Methodology HKU library database, PubMed, and reference screening for trials published in English from 1990 to May 2014. Randomized, controlled trials of individuals using calcium supplements (calcium carbonate and <b>calcium</b> citrate <b>malate)</b> and placebo group with bone fractures and bone mass density as outcome measure. Finding Adding calcium supplements into a low calcium diet reduces the rate of bone loss and prevents bone fractures. Evidence for calcium supplements in significant reduction of bone mass density; however, the impact of calcium supplements on bone fracture risk remains unclear. Conclusion Based on my review, it shows that there is an association between the use of calcium supplementations and retardation of the rate of bone loss as well as reduction in bone fracture risk in individuals with low dietary calcium and are generally compliance with the treatment. To get enough calcium through diet is encouraged over calcium supplements. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} growth, menstrual status, and calcium supplementation on iron status were studied over 4 y in 354 girls in pubertal stage 2 who were premenarcheal at {{baseline}} (x – – SD age: 10. 8 – 0. 8 y). Girls {{were randomly assigned}} to placebo or treatment with 1000 mg Ca/d as <b>calcium</b> citrate <b>malate.</b> Anthropometric characteristics, bone mass, and nutritional status were measured biannually; ferritin was measured annually; and red blood cell indexes were determined at 4 y. The simultaneous effects of iron intake and menstrual status on serum ferritin, after change in lean body mass (LBM) was controlled for, were evaluated in subjects in the upper and lower quartiles of cumulative iron intake. The average maximal accumulation of LBM (386 g/mo; 95 % CI: 372, 399) occurred 0. 5 y before the onset of menarche. Change in LBM {{was a significant predictor of}} serum ferritin (P < 0. 0001), with a negative influence on iron status (t ratio = 24. 12). The 2 fitted mathematical models representing ferritin concentrations of subjects in the upper and lower quartiles of cumulative iron intake were significantly different (P < 0. 018). The regression line of the ferritin concentration in menstruating girls with high iron intakes had a less negative slope than the line fit to serum ferritin concentrations in girls with low iron intakes (NS). Serum ferritin concentrations at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 y were not significantly different between groups. In addition, there was no significant difference between groups in any of the red blood cell indexes. In summary, growth spurt and menstrual status had adverse effects on iron stores in adolescent girls with low iron intakes (< 9 mg/d), whereas long-term supplementation with calcium (total intake: < 1500 mg/d) did not affect iron status.

40|$|Calcium is an {{essential}} mineral for the organism. Numerous calcium sources are available to enrich food products, but only calcium carbonate has been well studied. Calcium bioaccessibility depends mainly on solubility. Furthermore in vitro digestion allows to determine bioaccessibility and to identify the key parameters affecting it. The {{purpose of this study}} was to focus on the influence of gastro-intestinal pH variation, the effect of the food matrix structure and the calcium sources on calcium bioaccessibility. Four calcium sources (calcium carbonate, <b>calcium</b> citrate <b>malate,</b> dairy <b>calcium</b> phosphate and calcium bisglycinate) were added at 0. 5 % (w/w) in water (control), and in whey protein matrices liquid or heat-induced gel. These matrices were digested under static conditions in duplicate, with the harmonized INFOGEST protocol (Minekus et al. 2014). Soluble and ionic calcium, and pH kinetics were followed during in vitro digestion. The kinetics were analyzed by nonparametric tests with repeated measurements. Results showed that all calcium sources were soluble in the matrices, mainly as ionic form (Ca 2 +), during the gastric phase at pH 3, but that calcium insolubilisation occurred in the intestinal compartment at pH 7. Dairy calcium phosphate insolubilisation was quicker and more intense than for other calcium sources; its concentration of soluble calcium is 17 +/- 3 %, instead of more than 60 % for the three other calcium sources (p 0. 1). These results provide new insights to better understand bioavailability differences between calcium sources and matrices. Further in vivo digestion experiments on a pig model will be achieved in order to confirm bioaccessibility and to measure the bioavailability of those different sources of calcium. It will finally provide a relation between the results from in vitro and in vivo models of digestion...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of ions, starch, buffer strength and pH on solubilization of pectic galacturonan from potato cell wall material during boiling was studied. The ions enhanced β-eliminative degradation of galacturonan, but calcium, copper (II) and iron (II) cations slowed down the solubilization at pH 6. 1. Magnesium was ineffective. Citrate, malate and phytate anions favoured it. Maceration of potato tissue disks by pectic lyases and model cooking experiments demonstrated {{the ability of}} calcium ions to retain intercellular cohesion of potato tissue even when pectic galacturonan had been severely degraded. In a pH range of 6. 1 - 6. 5, β-eliminative pectin degradation was shown by specific periodate thiobarbituric acid staining to occur in cell wall and potato tissue boiling.

40|$|The daily {{cycle of}} the {{transpiration}} rate, stomatal con-ductance, water potential, and the concentration of the main osmoticum identified in ash leaves, malate and mannitol, were monitored in a field on the Isere river plain. On sunny days, the stomatal conductance tends to remain close to its maximun value allowing a high transpiration rate and diurnal variations in leaf water potential, i//w, which may fall as low as — 2 MPa at solar noon. These variations of i//m are closely correl-ated with changes in malate, mannitol and the concen-tration of the well-known osmoticum K +, which agree with the involvement of an osmotic adjustment to counteract the evaporative demand during daylight hours. How malate, mannitol and K+ contribute to the osmotic adjustment was analysed subsequently by comparing the solute potential <ps, evaluated by the Boyle-Van't Hoff relation, to the osmotic potential <//„ measured by thermocouple psychrometry. These experiments have led us to suspect some errors in the measurement of i//n, presumably due to experimental artefacts {{and the ability of}} Ca 2 +, present in high levels in leaves, to form chelates with malate once the cells have been decompartmented by freezing and thawing.

METHODS: Within 24 h of intensive care unit management, patients with gastric cancer were enrolled after written informed consent and randomized to the intensive insulin therapy (IIT) group to keep glucose levels from 4. 4 to 6. 1 mmol/L or the conventional insulin therapy (CIT) group to keep levels less than 10 mmol/L. Resting energy expenditure (REE), respiratory quotient (RQ), resting energy expenditure per kilogram (REE/kg), and the lipid oxidation rate were monitored by the indirect calorimeter of <b>calcium</b> citrate <b>malate</b> nutrition metabolism investigation system. The changes in body composition were analyzed by multi-frequency bioimpedance analysis. Blood fasting glucose and insulin concentration were measured for assessment of Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled. Compared with preoperative baseline, postoperative REE increased by over 22. 15 % and 11. 07 %; REE/kg rose up to 27. 22 1; 1. 33 kcal/kg and 24. 72 1; 1. 43 kcal/kg; RQ decreased to 0. 759 1; 0. 034 and 0. 791 1; 0. 037; the lipid oxidation ratio was up to 78. 25 % 1; 17. 74 % and 67. 13 % 1; 12. 76 % supported by parenteral nutrition solutions from 37. 56 % 1; 11. 64 % at the baseline; the level of Ln-HOMA-IR went up dramatically (P < 0. 05, respectively) on postoperative days 1 and 3 in the IIT group. Meanwhile the concentration of total protein, albumin and triglyceride declined significantly on postoperative days 1 and 3 compared with pre-operative levels (P < 0. 05, respectively). Compared with the CIT group, IIT reduced the REE/kg level (27. 22 1; 1. 33 kcal/kg vs 29. 97 1; 1. 47 kcal/kg, P = 0. 008; 24. 72 1; 1. 43 kcal/kg vs 25. 66 1; 1. 63 kcal/kg, P = 0. 013); and decreased the Ln-HOMA-IR score (P = 0. 019, 0. 028) on postoperative days 1 and 3; IIT decreased the level of CRP on postoperative days 1 and 3 (P = 0. 017, 0. 006); the total protein and albumin concentrations in the IIT group were greater {{than those in the}} CIT group (P = 0. 023, 0. 009).

40|$|Methane {{is a major}} {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) produced during the normal digestive process in ruminant animals (Blaxter and Clapperton, 1965) with a global warming potential, 25 -fold that of carbon dioxide (IPCC, 2007). In addition to environmental implications, ruminant methanogenesis represents a loss of 2 e 12 % of the gross energy intake (Johnson and Johnson, 1995; Soltanali et al., 2015) with a greater environmental impact from the confinement system compared with pasture-based system (O'Brien et al., 2012). A cow can produce 250 to 500 L of methane (CH 4) per day depending on {{the quantity and quality}} of the feed which affects rate of digestion and rate of passage in the fermentation process (Johnson and Johnson, 1995). Furthermore, cattle consuming high fibre diets typically lose about 6 % of gross dietary energy as methane (CH 4), whereas those on high concentrate rations generally lose about 3 % of dietary gross energy as CH 4 (Mc Geough et al., 2012). According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the livestock sector is responsible for about 18 % of total global anthropogenic GHG emissionsRuminants are one of the major generators of methane, a {{greenhouse gas}} (GHG) with a global warming potential, 25 -fold that of carbon dioxide. Methane production by ruminants also reduces the gross feed energy intake utilization by about 2 e 12 %. The present study aimed to test the effects of different levels of a ruminal fermentation modulator (RFM) on in vitro ruminal fermentation and GHG production of five total mixed rations (TMR) with different silage (S) to-concentrate (C) ratios (0 S: 100 C, 25 S: 75 C, 50 S: 50 C, 75 S: 25 C, and 100 S: 0 C). The RFM contained mainly <b>calcium</b> propionate and <b>malate,</b> and monopropylene glycol. The rumen inoculum was collected from a Brown Swiss cow fed a TMR of concentrate and alfalfa hay (1 : 1 dry matter (DM)) ad libitum. Gas production (GP) measurements were recorded up to 72 h of incubation. There were interactions (P 0. 05) on methane production. The DM digestibility increased (linear effect; P ¼ 0. 003) as silage level increased. Overall, increasing silage in the TMR lowered the asymptotic GP and DM digestibility. The asymptotic GP was higher with the addition of the RFM without any effect on fermentation kinetics. These results suggest that the RFM can be used as an environmental cleaner product in animal farming due to its ability to improve ruminal fermentation of feedstuffs and to reduce methane emission...|$|R

SUMMARY ANSWER The length of cryostorage {{has no effect on}} the gene expression profile of human MII oocytes. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Oocyte cryopreservation is a widely used technique in IVF for storage of surplus oocytes, as well as for fertility preservation (i. e. women undergoing gonadotoxic therapies) and oocyte donation programs. Although cryopreservation has negative impacts on oocyte physiology and it is associated with decrease of transcripts, no experimental data about the effect of storage time on the oocyte molecular profile are available to date. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This study included 27 women, ≤ 38 years aged, without any ovarian pathology, undergoing IVF treatment. Surplus MII oocytes were donated after written informed consent. A total of 31 non-cryopreserved oocytes and 68 surviving slow-frozen/rapid-thawed oocytes (32 oocytes cryostored for 3 years and 36 cryostored for 6 years) were analyzed. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Pools of ≈ 10 oocytes for each group were prepared. Total RNA was extracted from each pool, amplified, labeled and hybridized on oligonucleotide microarrays. Analyses were performed by R software using the limma package. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Comparison of gene expression profiles between surviving thawed oocytes after 3 and 6 years of storage in liquid nitrogen found no differently expressed genes. The expression profiles of cryopreserved MII oocytes significantly differed from those of non-cryopreserved oocytes in 107 probe sets corresponding to 73 down-regulated and 29 up-regulated unique transcripts. Gene Ontology analysis by DAVID bioinformatics resource disclosed that cryopreservation deregulates genes involved in oocyte function and early embryo development, such as chromosome organization, RNA splicing and processing, cell cycle, cellular response to DNA damage and to stress, DNA repair, <b>calcium</b> ion binding, <b>malate</b> dehydrogenase activity and mitochondrial activity. Among the probes significantly up-regulated in cryopreserved oocytes, two corresponded to ovary-specific expressed large intergenic noncoding (linc) RNAs. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Data validation in a larger cohort of samples would be beneficial, although we applied stringent criteria for gene selection (fold-change > 3 or < 1 / 3 and FDR < 0. 1). Further research should be undertaken to verify experimentally that the length of cryostorage has no effect on gene expression profile of vitrified/warmed MII oocytes, as well as to include in analyses 'older' frozen oocytes. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Confirmation that the length of storage does not alter the gene expression profile of frozen oocytes is noteworthy for the safety issue of long-term oocyte banking, i. e. fertility preservation, gamete donation.
