While the book is primarily a work of theoretical astrophysics, it also touches on quantum physics, chemistry, and earth science. An entire chapter argues that Homo sapiens is, with high probability, the only intelligent species in the Milky Way.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the present infrastructure and financial stability at GW {{is due to the}} tenures of Presidents Cloyd Heck Marvin, Lloyd Hartman Elliott and Stephen Joel Trachtenberg. In the 1930s, the university was a major center for theoretical physics. The <b>cosmologist</b> George Gamow produced critical work on the Big Bang theory at GW in the 1930s and 1940s. In {{one of the most important}} moments in the 20th century, Niels Bohr announced that Otto Hahn had successfully split the atom on January 26, 1939, at the Fifth Washington Conference on theoretical physics in the Hall of Government.|$|E
50|$|This {{explanation}} is not widely accepted among <b>cosmologists</b> since {{the evidence suggests}} that the fractal dimension of the universe is at least 2. Moreover, the majority of <b>cosmologists</b> accept the cosmological principle, which assumes that matter at the scale of billions of light years is distributed isotropically. Contrarily, fractal cosmology requires anisotropic matter distribution at the largest scales; interestingly, cosmic microwave background radiation has cosine anisotropy.|$|R

25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that an intelligent species beyond a certain point of technological capability will destroy other intelligent species as they appear. The idea that something, or someone, might be destroying intelligent life in the universe has been explored in the scientific literature. A species might undertake such extermination out of expansionist motives, paranoia, or aggression. In 1981, <b>cosmologist</b> Edward Harrison argued that such behavior would {{be an act of}} prudence: an intelligent species that has overcome its own self-destructive tendencies might view any other species bent on galactic expansion as a threat. It has also been suggested that a successful alien species would be a superpredator, as are humans.|$|E
25|$|One {{hypothesis}} is that the Universe may have been designed by extra-universal aliens. Some believe this would {{solve the problem of}} how a designer or design team capable of fine-tuning the Universe could come to exist. <b>Cosmologist</b> Alan Guth believes humans will in time be able to generate new universes. By implication previous intelligent entities may have generated our Universe. This idea leads to the possibility that the extraterrestrial designer/designers are themselves the product of an evolutionary process in their own universe, which must therefore itself be able to sustain life. However it also raises the question of where that universe came from, leading to an infinite regress.|$|E
25|$|The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), {{originally}} {{known as}} the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP), was a spacecraft operating from 2001 to 2010 which measured temperature differences across the sky in the cosmic microwave background(CMB) –the radiant heat remaining from the Big Bang. Headed by Professor Charles L. Bennett of Johns Hopkins University, the mission was developed in a joint partnership between the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Princeton University. The WMAP spacecraft was launched on June 30, 2001 from Florida. The WMAP mission succeeded the COBE space mission and was the second medium-class (MIDEX) spacecraft in the NASA Explorers program. In 2003, MAP was renamed WMAP in honor of <b>cosmologist</b> David Todd Wilkinson (1935–2002), {{who had been a}} member of the mission's science team. After 9 years of operations, WMAP was switched off in 2010, following the launch of the more advanced Planck spacecraft by ESA in 2009.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Despite common {{acceptance}} of Big Bang hypothesis among most <b>cosmologists,</b> nonetheless there are criticisms {{from a small}} number of theorists partly supported by astronomy observation suggesting that redshift data could not always be attributed to cosmological expansion. In this paper, a new approach to cosmology “fractional calculus ” has been developed that we hope will attract attention from astrophysicists and <b>cosmologists</b> because of the way it challenges the conventional big bang framework...|$|R
5000|$|Scientists {{have tested}} {{carefully}} whether these assumptions are valid and {{borne out by}} observation. Observational <b>cosmologists</b> have discovered evidence — very strong in some cases — that supports these assumptions, and as a result, metric expansion of space is considered by <b>cosmologists</b> to be an observed feature {{on the basis that}} although we cannot see it directly, scientists have tested the properties of the universe and observation provides compelling confirmation.

It featured the first official appearance of Lindsey Naegle and was the first episode in which theoretical physicist and <b>cosmologist</b> Stephen Hawking guest-starred as himself. The Simpsons staff wanted Hawking to guest-star because they needed someone who would be smarter than all of Springfield's Mensa members, and because they had heard that he was a fan of the show. The episode features references to Star Trek, painter Vincent van Gogh and architect Frank Lloyd Wright, and mentions the theory of the universe being toroidal, the same shape as a doughnut.|$|E

Moreover, humans may be an unsuitable food source for extraterrestrials because of marked differences in biochemistry. For example, the chirality of molecules used by terrestrial biota may differ from those used by extraterrestrial beings.

500|$|In the 1920s and 1930s {{almost every}} major <b>cosmologist</b> {{preferred}} an eternal steady state universe, and several {{complained that the}} beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady state theory. This perception was enhanced {{by the fact that the}} originator of the Big Bang theory, Georges Lemaître, was a Roman Catholic priest. Arthur Eddington agreed with Aristotle that the universe did not have a beginning in time, viz., that matter is eternal. A beginning in time was [...] "repugnant" [...] to him. Lemaître, however, thought thatIf the world has begun with a single quantum, the notions of space and time would altogether fail to have any meaning at the beginning; they would only begin to have a sensible meaning when the original quantum had been divided into a sufficient number of quanta. If this suggestion is correct, the beginning of the world happened a little before the beginning of space and time.|$|E
500|$|The Big Bang theory {{developed}} from {{observations of the}} structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912 Vesto Slipher measured the first Doppler shift of a [...] "spiral nebula" [...] (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was highly controversial whether or not these nebulae were [...] "island universes" [...] outside our Milky Way. Ten years later, Alexander Friedmann, a Russian <b>cosmologist</b> and mathematician, derived the Friedmann equations from Albert Einstein's equations of general relativity, showing that the universe might be expanding in contrast to the static universe model advocated by Einstein at that time. In 1924 Edwin Hubble's measurement of the great distance to the nearest spiral nebulae showed that these systems were indeed other galaxies. Independently deriving Friedmann's equations in 1927, Georges Lemaître, a Belgian physicist and Roman Catholic priest, proposed that the inferred recession of the nebulae was due to the expansion of the universe.|$|E
