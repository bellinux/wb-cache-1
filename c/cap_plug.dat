50|$|When in firing position, {{the mortar}} tube is {{attached}} to the bipod by a clamp. It then is fastened to the base plate by the insertion of the spherical knob on the base cap into the socket on the plate and rotating the mortar 90 degrees right or left. The tube is smooth bored, and its interior surface is carefully finished. Tolerance between the wall of the tube and the bourrelet of the shell is very close, thus preventing the shell from striking the firing pin with sufficient percussion to detonate the primer. On its outside surface the tube has a sighting line and quadrant seat at the muzzle end. The base cap of the tube is hollowed and threaded to screw onto the breech end of the tube which it thereby seals against gas leakage. The cap terminates in a spherical knob, which locks into the socket of the base plate and is bored and is threaded axially to receive the firing pin and the base <b>cap</b> <b>plug.</b>|$|E

40|$|The use {{of cotton}} plug as closure of a {{bacterial}} culture flask {{had been reported}} to have many disadvantages such as inhibitory nature of cotton to certain microbes, chances of contamination during handling and accumulation of used cotton as biological waste. To overcome the disadvantages of cotton plugs, we have developed a new method of capping bacterial culture flasks. In the present study, three sets of experiments were conducted, one was {{to find out the}} efficiency of bacterial growth in culture flasks closed by either glass <b>caps</b> or cotton <b>plugs</b> and the second set was to find out the chances of getting contamination of sterile broth closed by either glass <b>caps</b> or cotton <b>plugs</b> and the third set was to find out the evaporation of water in conical flasks closed by glass <b>caps</b> or cotton <b>plug.</b> The results showed that the bacterial cultures closed by glass caps showed better growth with less chance of contamination and evaporation of the culture media. By this method, the bacterial culture work is made very simpler than using cotton plug...|$|R

40|$|Apexification is the endodontic {{procedure}} {{performed in}} order to induce {{the formation of a}} physical barrier of mineralized tissue in teeth with incomplete root formation. It is mainly performed when, for any reason, pulpal necrosis occurs in teeth with incomplete root formation and also in those cases where the foramen is open, due to root resorption. In these situations, conventional endodontic treatment becomes difficult or virtually impossible, because of the large foramen. The apexification procedure, in these cases, is generally performed by means of successive changes of calcium hydroxide dressings, aiming to induce the formation of a physical barrier of mineralized tissue, thus permitting the obturation of root canals.

40|$|Plug and Process Loads (PPLs) are {{building}} loads {{that are not}} related to general lighting, heating, ventilation, cooling, and water heating, and typically do not provide comfort to the building occupants. PPLs in commercial buildings account for almost 5 % of U. S. primary energy consumption. On an individual building level, they account for approximately 25 % of the total electrical load in a minimally code-compliant commercial building, and can exceed 50 % in an ultra-high efficiency building such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) Research Support Facility (RSF) (Lobato et al. 2010). Minimizing these loads is a primary challenge in the design and operation of an energy-efficient building. A complex array of technologies that measure and manage PPLs has emerged in the marketplace. Some fall short of manufacturer performance claims, however. NREL has been actively engaged in developing an evaluation and selection process for PPLs control, and is using this process to evaluate a range of technologies for active PPLs management that will <b>cap</b> RSF <b>plug</b> loads.

They are used to allow an auger (or plumber's snake) to clean out a plugged drain. Since clean-out augers are limited in length, clean-outs should be placed in accessible locations at regular intervals throughout a drainage system (including outside the building).

An aluminium twin spar frame which reduced frame weight was used, and the engine crankcase was designed to share swing-arm pivot. Through a reduction of internal friction and weight, combined with larger valves, shorter stroke, and a bigger bore, higher revs were enabled. The spark <b>plug</b> <b>caps</b> had Ignition coils built into them. Slightly larger carbs were added and the oil cooler was now located by the oil filter.

The F4 was fitted with Honda’s HISS engine immobiliser system.|$|R
40|$|The seed coat {{structure}} and histochemistry of Abelmoschus esculentus were studied by bright-field, fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. The seed coat {{was typical of}} species of the Malvaceae. The endotesta cells had inner tangential walls which were very thick and autofluorescent. The occurrence of phenolic substances at this level has been related to seed coat imposed dormancy. The palisade cells were composed of three differently shaped parts: an upper ‘prismatic part’, a medium ‘transition part’ and a lower ‘twisted part’. The former was rich in hydrophilic substances, the latter was lignified. The swelling of the ‘prismatic parts’ was related to seed coat cracks. The region controlling onset of water entry {{was thought to be}} the chalazal area. Thanks to the presence of a large amount of highly acidic polysaccharide, water was able to penetrate from the permeable maternal tissue, through the chalazal <b>cap</b> and <b>plug</b> as far as the boundary between the palisade and underlying mesophyll. During imbibition of water a kidney-shaped ‘blister’ was seen to rise, formed by separation of the palisade cells from an underlying single layer of subpalisade cells. The palisade layer forming the blister roof showed the same histochemical characteristic of other seed regions. The single layer of the blister floor showed an affinity with Toluidine Blue O and Alcian blue. Both blister roof and floor were strongly autofluorescent...|$|R

40|$|The chaperone/usher {{system is}} one of the best {{characterized}} pathways for protein secretion and assembly of cell surface appendages in Gram-negative bacteria. In particular, this pathway is used for biogenesis of the P pilus, a key virulence factor used by uropathogenic Escherichia coli to adhere to the host urinary tract. The P pilus individual subunits bound to the periplasmic chaperone PapD are delivered to the outer membrane PapC usher, which serves as an assembly platform for subunit incorporation into the pilus and secretion of the pilus fiber to the cell surface. PapC forms a dimeric, twin pore complex, with each monomer composed of a 24 -stranded transmembrane β-barrel channel, an internal plug domain that occludes the channel, and globular N- and C-terminal domains that are located in the periplasm. Here we have used planar lipid bilayer electrophysiology to characterize the pore properties of wild type PapC and domain deletion mutants for the first time. The wild type pore is closed most of the time but displays frequent short-lived transitions to various open states. In comparison, PapC mutants containing deletions of the plug domain, an α-helix that <b>caps</b> the <b>plug</b> domain, or the N- and C-terminal domains form channels with higher open probability but still exhibiting dynamic behavior. Removal of the plug domain results in a channel with extremely large conductance. These observations suggest that the plug gates the usher channel closed and that the periplasmic domains and α-helix function to modulate the gating activity of the PapC twin pore...|$|R
60|$|The {{depth of}} the inner tube of the whistle at any moment is shown by the {{graduations}} {{on the outside of}} the instrument. The lower portion of the instrument as formerly made for me by the late Mr. Tisley, optician, Brompton Road,[28] is a cap that surrounds the body of the whistle, and is itself fixed to the screw that forms the plug. One complete turn of the cap increases or diminishes the {{depth of the}} whistle, by an amount equal to the interval between two adjacent threads of the screw. For mechanical convenience, a screw is used whose pitch is 25 to the inch; therefore one turn of the <b>cap</b> moves the <b>plug</b> one twenty-fifth of an inch, or ten two-hundred-and-fiftieths. The edge of the cap is divided into ten parts, each of which corresponds to the tenth of a complete turn; and, therefore, to one two-hundred-and-fiftieth of an inch. Hence in reading off the graduations the tens are shown on the body of the whistle, and the units are shown on the edge of the cap.|$|R
40|$|At a few sites near Cromwell and Alexandra, Central Otago, {{there exist}} {{isolated}} populations of a threatened ground wētā (Hemiandrus sp.). Research {{was required to}} establish guidelines for a management programme to enhance the species' chances of long term survival. To avoid disturbance of the threatened species, a newly discovered, relatively widespread and abundant allopatric species (Hemiandrus new sp. from the Tekapo River area) was selected for study. A sixteen month sampling programme based on pitfall trapping was employed to characterise the species' distribution relative to habitat variables. By far the most important determinant of distribution was the local depth of substrate available for burrowing, wētā being most abundant where friable silty soil was deepest. Female wētā oviposit in their own burrows in late summer, and the eggs hatch in the following spring. Over two years, female nymphs develop through nine instars, and males ten. Males die soon after mating in their third summer, while females overwinter with their eggs, surviving until the following summer. Analysis of the crop contents of a sample of wētā revealed that the species is a primarily herbivorous omnivore. wētā caught in summer were significantly more herbivorous than those caught in the other seasons. Hemiandrus new sp. constructs its burrows in silty loam, and closes the top with a <b>cap</b> or <b>plug.</b> At {{the lower end of}} the burrow is a slightly enlarged chamber curved nearly horizontal. The most serious current predators of the Tekapo wētā, apart from native invertebrates, are hedgehogs and cats. It was considered reasonable to extrapolate conclusions about the Tekapo species regarding habitat requirements, life history and potential threats to the remaining populations, to the Cromwell species. Recommendations for the management of the Cromwell species (and other closely related threatened species) based on the conclusions of the research are presented, as well as suggestions for important further work...|$|R
40|$|Objective: to {{understand}} the conceptions, attitudes and practices about self-care among informal recyclers in Medellín. Methodology: a qualitative study {{from the perspective of}} recyclers not belonging to any guild in Medellín in 2005 was developed. A total amount of 52 interviews with previous informed consent were applied, plus non-participant observation and field diary. Results: self-care is understood as the constant protection of the body {{in order to avoid the}} occurrence of diseases. It includes aspects of hygiene, diet, medical consultation, proper use of leisure time and utilization of instruments for personal protection, such as gloves, face masks, <b>caps,</b> and ear <b>plugs</b> among other devices. Discussion: disease prevention goes beyond biological aspects and becomes part of a social dimension for people in which the most important features are the consequences for themselves, their labor team and their families. Recyclers have knowledge on prevention and practices that promote health and well-being, but the latter are not applied because they diminish their job performance, or they do not consider them to be necessary, do not feel like executing them nor they lack the economic resources to assume them. Autocare practices of recyclers are mainly supported by the primacy of the team history than by the scientific knowledge concerning it...|$|R
40|$|Morphological, ultrastructural, and cytochemical {{characteristics}} of the red alga Plocamium cartilagineum from Antarctica have been studied and {{compared with those of}} the same species from the Mediterranean Sea. Distinct regions with possibly different functions were recognisable in the bushy thallus of Plocamium cartilagineum. Chloroplasts were concentrated in the outermost cell layer, while in the other cortex cells abundant floridean starch accumulated. No starch was found in the large medullary cells, characterised by the insertion in their walls of several large and lenticular pit connections devoid of <b>plug</b> <b>caps</b> and proteic in nature. Sulphated polysaccharides were distributed in the extracellular compartments of all the regions of the thallus, except in the surface layer. These acidic phycocolloids were particularly concentrated in the cell wall proper, which also exhibited a well organised fibrillar component probably consisting of cellulose. The distinctive feature of the Antarctic thalli, compared with the Mediterranean ones, was the lack, in the former, of recognisable phycobilisomes on the thylakoid surfaces. This peculiarity had already been noticed in the other Antarctic red alga Iridaea cordata, collected, like Plocamium cartilagineum, in summer and from ice free waters. The loss of phycobilisomes may be a defence mechanism activated by benthic shade-adapted red algae from Antarctica to protect the photosynthetic apparatus against damage from high light intensities...|$|R
40|$|The Multi-Canister Overpack (MCO) {{incorporates}} plated seals for {{use with}} (1) the port cover plates, (2) process valves of the shield plug, and (3) test <b>plug</b> ofthe cover <b>cap.</b> These seals are required to maintain leakage rates as low as 10 {sup - 7 } scc/atm-sec. in the cover <b>cap</b> to test <b>plug</b> seal. The seals are manufactured by EG&G division of Perkin Elmer. Currently, the MCO design calls for use of silver or gold plated seals in these locations. The seal plating materials are deposited on Inconel 718 or X- 750 substrates. Some of these seals are reused several times in service on the MCO. The MCO manufacturer has built several MCOs {{and is in the}} leak testing stage and has had great difficulty obtaining acceptable leakage rates at their plant in Camden, New Jersey. The seal manufacturer was called in to evaluate the situation and now the seal manufacturer recommends tin plated seals. This evaluation examines the Corrosion resistance and thermal stability of tin plating on the seals. The use of tin plating on MCO seals was evaluated for corrosion resistance and thermal stability. The corrosion resistance of tin in the expected MCO environments is acceptable. The effect of radiation hardening will offset creep deformation results. However, a low melting point indicates unsuitability at significantly elevated temperatures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Louisiana red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, {{which was}} {{introduced}} into Egypt in the 1980 s, {{has since become}} widespread across the country. Burrowing behavior of P. clarkii, was investigated in irrigation canal of three different sites (Abou-Kabir, Abou-hammad and Belbies) at Sharkia Governorate from January 2014 to December 2015. Most burrows were simple in their morphology and few of them had two types of chimney (plugged and open). Open chimney was present at 100 cm of the edge side of irrigation canal, while <b>plugged</b> <b>cap</b> chimney was located inside the agriculture soil. Result indicated that {{a great number of}} P. clarkii were observed migrating across roadways to find the main irrigation canal, during their crossing many of them were killed by cars.

40|$|International audienceAn {{authoritative}} case of Vulcanian eruptive dynamics is {{the series}} of 88 explosions that occurred between August and October 1997 at Soufrière Hills volcano on Montserrat Island. The state of the magmatic column just before a Vulcanian explosion is still poorly understood, but conditions the eruptive style. This study establishes such a pre-explosive stratigraphy by 1) documenting the textures covering {{the range of the}} 1997 products, 2) quantitative analysis of H 2 O content in interstitial glass measured by Karl–Fischer Titration, and 3) combining these data with a simple model linking pre- and post-explosive vesicularities. The model shows that syn-explosive degassing affects greatly the way porosity evolves by decompression during an explosion. The stratigraphy reconstruction shows a three-part vertical layering of the conduit prior to explosion with overall denser values than those previously suggested. A dense and strongly degassed <b>plug</b> <b>caps</b> the column. It is underlain by a shallow transition zone featuring complex mingling between vesicular and dense magma up to 10 MPa. At higher pressure, up to 80 MPa, lies a more homogeneous zone of relatively dense (10 – 20 vol. %) magma, which was emplaced under partly open-system degassing. This conduit stratigraphy gives the vision of a strongly heterogeneous magma column immediately prior to its disruption. Our analysis suggests that fragmenting such a composite magma cannot happen in a single coherent pulse, but rather as stages. The transition zone contains heterogeneous amounts of exsolved gas that could explain the pulsatory nature of the Vulcanian jets {{at the beginning of the}} explosions. This contrasts with the nearly constant vesicularities of the deeper part of the pre-explosive magma column, which are propitious to a general, short-lived disruption...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 1995 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 11 and 12, 1995, Athens, Georgia. Based on {{problems}} {{associated with the use of}} chlorine as a water disinfectant and with the control of bacterial populations in biofilms, 1, 3 -dichloro- 2, 2, 5, 5 -tetramethy 1 - 4 - imidazolidinone (compound DC) and 1 -bromo- 3 -chloro- 2, 2, 5, 5 - tetramethy 1 - 4 -imidazolidinone (compound DBC) were used to control planktonic and sessile populations of Klebsiella. Following the suspension of stainless steel disks in tubes, the tubes were <b>capped</b> with gauze/cotton <b>plugs</b> and autoclaved. Sterile chlorine demand-free buffers and inocula of mucoid and nonmucoid variants of Klebsiella were introduced to the tubes to initiate biofilm formation. After 24 to 48 hours equilibration time, both sessile and planktonic cells were exposed to varying concentrations of the disinfectants. Fluid samples and disk surface scrapings were used to determine the length of time required to achieve a 99. 9999 % decrease in viable cells. While disinfection rates were slower with the sessile organisms than with the planktonic organisms, both organic N-halamine disinfectants achieved 6 log decreases in viable Klebsiella in less than 12 hours.
