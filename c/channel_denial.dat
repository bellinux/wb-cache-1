Therefore, a centralized or hierarchical network security solution does not work well. This work provides scalable, distributed authentication services in ad hoc networks. Our design takes a self-securing approach, in which multiple nodes (say, k) collaboratively provide authentication services for any node in the network. This paper follows the design guidelines of [7] and makes several new contributions. We first formalize a localized trust model that lays the foundation for the design, and then expand the adversary model that the system should handle. We further propose refined localized certification services, and develop a new scalable solution of share updates to resist more powerful adversaries. Finally, the new solution is evaluated through simulations. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{designer}} of reliable MLS networks must consider covert <b>channels</b> and <b>denial</b> of service attacks {{in addition to}} traditional network performance measures such as throughput, fairness, and reliability. In this paper we show how to extend the NRL data Pump to a certain MLS network architecture in order to balance the requirements of congestion control, fairness, good performance, and reliability against those of minimal threats from covert <b>channels</b> and <b>denial</b> of service attacks. We back up our claims with simulation results. ...|$|R

On the other hand, acknowledgements (ACK) to Low that High has received its messages are necessary for reliability and performance. This is especially true for distributed systems in which the communication channels may not always be reliable. High, however, can manipulate the times that ACKs arrive i [...] ...|$|R

The recording, despite <b>Channel</b> 4's <b>denial</b> of having sold it, then ended up in a Virgin Records studio in the Netherlands. The Sami organisation Sámi kopiija demanded royalties from Virgin Records but this has so far been unsuccessful.|$|R

Sometimes {{it is possible}} to obtain covert assistance to die from a sympathetic doctor or nurse; however, making a public request for such assistance actually makes it more difficult to obtain, because medical personnel know they will then be under greater scrutiny (Nitschke and Stewart 2006).|$|R
40|$|Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} offer convenient infrastructureless communications {{over the}} shared wireless channel. However, {{the nature of}} mobile ad hoc networks makes them vulnerable to security attacks, such as passive eavesdropping over the wireless <b>channel</b> and <b>denial</b> of service attacks by malicious nodes. To ensure the security, several cryptography protocols are implemented. Due to the resource scarcity in mobile ad hoc networks, the protocols must be communication efficient and need as less computational power as possible. Broadcast communication is an important operation for many application in mobile ad hoc networks. To securely broadcast a message, all the members in the network need share a group key {{so that they can}} use efficient symmetric encryption, such as DES and AES. Several group key management protocols have been proposed. However, not all of them are communication efficient when applied to mobile ad hoc networks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical key agreement protocol that is communication efficient to mobile ad hoc networks. We also show how to manage the group efficiently in a mobile environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The 802. 11 {{standard}} specifies {{mechanisms for}} channel access, data delivery, authentication and privacy for wireless communication. The standard makes no provisions for faulty, selfish or malicious behavior assuming that nodes always act {{according to the}} specifications of the protocol. Thus, nodes running defective protocol implementations, misconfigured, or compromised can potentially cause significant disruption in the network. In this paper we present an analysis of <b>channel</b> access <b>denial</b> of service attacks against 802. 11 b. We demonstrate the attacks through simulation and analyze them by considering the effect of multiple attackers, their relative positioning and {{the timing of the}} attack, missing from the previous papers. Our study of the attacks under varying timing provides a new direction for developing mitigation techniques at a higher layer completely independent of the Medium Access Control(MAC). In addition, we identify and describe new attacks against the beacon-based synchronization mechanism used for channel access and by the power saving mode in 802. 11 a, b, and g. We provide simulation results that demonstrate their feasibility and analyze them considering the attacker’s effort versus the induced damage and effect on other protocols and services. Finally, we discuss some detection and mitigation techniques for the analyzed attacks, demonstrating the efficacy of several of them through simulations. I...|$|R
30|$|Cognitive radio ad hoc {{networks}} (CRAHNs) {{consist of}} autonomous nodes that operate in ad hoc mode and aim at efficient utilization of spectrum resources. Usually, the cognitive nodes in a CRAHN exploit {{a number of}} available channels, but these channels are not necessarily common to all nodes. Such a network environment poses the problem of establishing a common control channel (CCC) as there might be no channel common to all the network members at all. In designing protocols, therefore, it is highly desirable to consider the network environment with no CCC. In this article, we propose a MAC protocol called concurrent access MAC (CA-MAC) that operates in the network environment with no CCC. The two devices in a communication pair can {{communicate with each other}} even if they have only one common channel available. Therefore, the problems with CCC (such as <b>channel</b> saturation and <b>denial</b> of service attacks) can also be resolved. In CA-MAC, channel accesses are distributed over communication pairs, resulting in increased network connectivity. In addition, CA-MAC allows different communication pairs to access multiple channels concurrently. According to our performance study, CA-MAC provides higher network connectivity with shorter channel access delay compared to SYN-MAC, which is the conventional key MAC protocol for the network environment with no CCC, resulting in better network throughput.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Recently, tuning {{the clear}} channel {{assessment}} (CCA) threshold in conjunction with power control has been considered for improving the performance of WLANs. However, we show that, CCA tuning can be exploited by selfish nodes to obtain an unfair share of the available bandwidth. Specifically, a selfish entity can manipulate the CCA threshold to ignore ongoing transmissions; this increases the probability of accessing the medium and provides the entity a higher, unfair share of the bandwidth. We experiment on our 802. 11 testbed to characterize the effects of CCA tuning on both isolated links and in 802. 11 WLAN configurations. We focus on AP-client(s) configurations, proposing a novel approach to detect this misbehavior. A misbehaving client is unlikely to recognize low power receptions as legitimate packets; by intelligently sending low power probe messages, an AP can efficiently detect a misbehaving node. Our key contributions are: 1) We {{are the first to}} quantify the impact of selfish CCA tuning via extensive experimentation on various 802. 11 configurations. 2) We propose a lightweight scheme for detecting selfish nodes that inappropriately increase their CCAs. 3) We extensively evaluate our system on our testbed; its accuracy is 95 percent while the false positive rate is less than 5 percent.
