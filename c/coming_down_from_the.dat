5|$|Marcello Malpighi, {{the father}} of microscopical anatomy, {{discovered}} that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm. He observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> leaves, and being captured above the ring.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending {{at the foot of}} the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The {{original}} line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend. Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on {{the site of}} the sidings.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with these}} constraints, the Spanish {{expedition}} {{had to cross}} the river several times and fight at each ford against stiff opposition. The bulk of the Inca army confronted the Spaniards from a set of terraces overlooking a plain by the Urubamba River. Several Spanish assaults against the terraces failed against a shower of arrows, slingshots and boulders <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> terraces {{as well as from}} both flanks. To hinder the efforts of the Spanish cavalry the Incas flooded the plain using previously prepared channels; water eventually reached the horses' girths. The defenders then counterattacked; some of them used Spanish weapons captured in previous encounters such as swords, bucklers, armor and even a horse, ridden by Manco Inca himself. In a severely compromised situation, Hernando Pizarro ordered a retreat; under the cover of darkness the Spanish force fled through the Urubamba valley with the Incas in pursuit and reached Cusco the next day.|$|E

25|$|The valley's {{climate is}} varied. The eastern part near the Andes is cooler than {{the western side}} due to the breezes <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mountains, {{and most of the}} biggest {{producers}} are located in this area of Curicó and in Molina. At the western end, the coastal range protects the valley from the ocean influence.|$|E
25|$|Two {{aspartate}} {{amino acid}} residues (below left) are interacting with two adjacent water molecules (w6 and w8) in the Mn2+ isocitrate porcine IDH complex to deprotonate the alcohol off the alpha-carbon atom. The oxidation of the alpha-C also {{takes place in}} this picture where NAD+ accepts a hydride resulting in oxalosuccinate. Along with the sp3 to sp2 stereochemical change around the alpha-C, there is a ketone group that is formed form the alcohol group. The formation of this ketone double bond allows for resonance to take place as electrons <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> leaving carboxylate group move towards the ketone.|$|E

25|$|The second box is Step 1, {{which is}} the {{oxidation}} of the alpha-C (C#2). Oxidation {{is the first step}} that isocitrate goes through. In this process, the alcohol group off the alpha-carbon (C#2) is deprotonated and the electrons flow to the alpha-C forming a ketone group and removing a hydride off C#2 using NAD+/NADP+ as an electron accepting cofactor. The oxidation of the alpha-C allows for a position where electrons (in the next step) will be <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> carboxyl group and pushing the electrons (making the double bonded oxygen) back up on the oxygen or grabbing a nearby proton off a nearby Lysine amino acid.|$|E
25|$|In June 1809, Napoleon {{placed the}} VI Corps under Marshal Nicolas Soult's command. With Ney's troops, plus the II and V Corps, Soult planned to sweep south and destroy Arthur Wellesley's British army. Wellesley beat King Joseph Bonaparte and Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan at the Battle of Talavera on 28 July. When Spanish guerillas {{captured}} a French dispatch, the British general {{found out that}} Soult was <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north with three corps. Wellesley immediately bolted back toward Portugal and escaped the trap. During these operations, Ney's advanced guard clashed with a column under Robert Thomas Wilson at the Battle of Puerto de Baños on 12 August, but Marchand's troops were not engaged.|$|E
25|$|In When The Gods Came Down, Alford {{extended}} {{the scope of}} his study to Mesopotamian and biblical mythology. In this book, he separated his own exploded planet hypothesis of myth from Van Flandern’s exploded planet hypothesis of science. He argued that the Sumerian religion had been an ‘exploded planet cult’ and that its central myth had been encoded in tales of the gods <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sky– of the deluge {{and the creation of}} man– of the wars between gods of heaven and earth– and of the sacred marriage of the god and the goddess. One of his most controversial claims was that the story of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ allegorised the fate of the heavenly planet, and that Jesus in all probability never existed unless as the lead actor in an ancient Passion play.|$|E

50|$|The {{main river}} {{running through the}} country park is not the Stour. This is a mill stream called the 'new cut', {{established}} to operate a mill belonging to the priory, in use in the 14th century. It is joined at {{the eastern end of}} the country park by the Chilton stream. This itself is fed by the Hawedych, and by another stream <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> Poslingford. <b>The</b> smaller Stour now runs south of the country park, meandering around the priory and meadows.|$|R
25|$|Between 3 and 7 August 1811, Freire frittered {{away his}} chance to crush Leval. Soult left Granada and reached the Gor ravine on 9 August with 6,000 {{infantry}} and 1,500 cavalry. The position {{was so strong that}} Soult made no attempt to attack, but instead mounted occasional bombardments of the Spanish lines. Earlier, Soult had ordered Godinot to advance from Jaén against La Cuadra's position at Pozo Alcón. Godinot left Baeza on the 7th with at least 4,000 foot soldiers and 600 horsemen. In the face of this advance, La Cuadra abandoned Pozo Alcón on 8 August and fell back to the east in the direction of Huéscar. When he heard that Godinot was <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northwest, Freire sent O'Donnell's 4,000 men to occupy a blocking position at Zújar and ordered La Cuadra to join him there.|$|E
25|$|Following {{orders from}} the Navy Department, Farragut took his fleet {{upstream}} to capture other strongpoints on the river, {{with the aim of}} complete possession of the Mississippi. At Vicksburg, Mississippi he found that the bluffs were too high to be reached by the guns of his fleet, so he ordered Porter to bring his mortar flotilla up. The mortars suppressed the Rebel artillery well enough that Farragut's ships could pass the batteries at Vicksburg and link up with a Union flotilla <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north. The city could not be taken, however, without active participation by the army, which did not happen. On July 8, the bombardment ceased when Porter was ordered to Hampton Roads to assist in Major General George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign. A few days later, Farragut followed, and the first attempt to take Vicksburg was over.|$|E

To prevent Confederate warships from <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> James, the Union forces blocked the channel in mid-June 1864. Tecumseh sank four hulks and a schooner and laid several boom across the river as part of this effort. On 21 June, Commander Craven spotted a line of breastworks that the enemy was building at Howlett's Farm and the ship opened fire at the workers. The Confederates replied with a battery of four guns near the breastworks and her sisters [...] and [...] joined in the bombardment. A half-hour later, Confederate ships near Dutch Gap joined in, but their fire was ineffective because they were firing blindly at the Union monitors. During the engagement, Tecumseh fired forty-six 15-inch shells and was not hit by any Confederate shells. Craven claimed the destruction of one gun emplacement.|$|E
