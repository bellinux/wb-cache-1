25|$|Circuits with defined <b>control</b> <b>voltage</b> of the divider can {{compensate}} for the thermal drift of the LED in a RO, {{but not for the}} memory effect and thermal drift of the photoresistor. The latter compensation requires a second (reference) photoresistor, which is illuminated by the same light intensity, at the same temperature as the main (modulating) device. Best compensation is achieved when both photoresistors are formed on the same semiconductor chip. The reference photoresistor is included in a divider of stabilized voltage or in a measuring bridge. The error amplifier compares the voltage at the middle point of the divider with the target value and adjusts the controlling current. In the linear controlling regime the RO becomes an analog multiplier: the current through the photoresistor is proportional to the product of the voltage across the photoresistor and the <b>control</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E

25|$|Voltage-controlled {{amplifier}} (VCA) – After {{the signal}} generated by one (or {{a mix of}} more) VCOs has been modified by filters and LFOs, and its waveform has been shaped (contoured) by an ADSR envelope generator, it then passes on {{to one or more}} voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs). A VCA is a preamp that boosts (amplifies) the electronic signal before passing it on to an external or built-in power amplifier, as well as a means to control its amplitude (volume) using an attenuator. The gain of the VCA is affected by a <b>control</b> <b>voltage</b> (CV), coming from an envelope generator, an LFO, the keyboard or some other source.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oscillator}} {{generates a}} periodic output signal. Assume that initially the oscillator is at {{nearly the same}} frequency as the reference signal.

[...] Likewise, if the phase creeps ahead of the reference, the phase detector changes the <b>control</b> <b>voltage</b> {{to slow down the}} oscillator. [...] Since initially the oscillator may be far from the reference frequency, practical phase detectors may also respond to frequency differences, so as to increase the lock-in range of allowable inputs.|$|E

2500|$|A bang-bang {{charge pump}} phase {{detector}} must {{always have a}} dead band where the phases of inputs are close enough that the detector detects no phase error. For this reason, bang-bang phase detectors [...] are associated with significant minimum peak-to-peak jitter, because of drift within the dead band. However these types, having outputs consisting of very narrow pulses at lock, are very useful for applications requiring very low VCO spurious outputs. [...] The narrow pulses contain very little energy and are easy to filter out of the VCO <b>control</b> <b>voltage.</b> [...] This results in low VCO control line ripple and therefore low FM sidebands on the VCO.|$|E
2500|$|Collector {{triggering}} input circuit: {{the input}} trigger signal is fed to the collector via a fast switching diode , possibly after being {{shaped by a}} pulse shaping network. This way of driving an avalanche transistor was extensively employed in first generation circuits since the collector node has a high impedance and also collector capacitance [...] behaves quite linearly under large signal regime. As a consequence of this, the delay time from input to output is very small and approximately independent {{of the value of}} <b>control</b> <b>voltage.</b> However, this trigger circuit requires a diode capable of resist to high reverse voltages and switch very fast, characteristics that are very difficult to realize in the same diode, therefore it is rarely seen in modern avalanche transistor circuits.|$|E
2500|$|To {{suppress}} the unwanted image, the tuning of the RF {{stage and the}} LO may need to [...] "track" [...] each other. In some cases, a narrow-band receiver can have a fixed tuned RF amplifier. In that case, only the local oscillator frequency is changed. In most cases, a receiver's input band is wider than its IF center frequency. For example, a typical AM broadcast band receiver covers 510kHz to 1655kHz (a roughly 1160kHz input band) with a 455kHz IF frequency; an FM broadcast band receiver covers 88MHz to 108MHz band with a 10.7MHz IF frequency. In that situation, the RF amplifier must be tuned so the IF amplifier does not see two stations at the same time. If the AM broadcast band receiver LO were set at 1200kHz, it would see stations at both 745kHz (1200455kHz) and 1655kHz. Consequently, the RF stage must be designed so that any stations that are twice the IF frequency away are significantly attenuated. The tracking {{can be done with}} a multi-section variable capacitor or some varactors driven by a common <b>control</b> <b>voltage.</b> An RF amplifier may have tuned circuits at both its input and its output, so three or more tuned circuits may be tracked. In practice, the RF and LO frequencies need to track closely but not perfectly.|$|E

Each accelerometer keeps a cubic proof-mass levitated {{in the center of a}} slightly larger cavity (Fedosov and Pereštý 2011; Zadražil 2011). The levitation is achieved by applying <b>control</b> <b>voltages</b> to six pairs of electrodes located on the inner walls of the cavity. The <b>control</b> <b>voltages</b> are representative for the acceleration of the proof-mass relative to the cavity. Since the cavity is firmly attached to the satellite body at the satellite’s center of mass, these accelerations are also representative for the non-gravitational accelerations acting on the satellites.|$|R
