40|$|AbstractPurpose of the articlePurpose of {{the present}} article is to {{identify}} drawbacks {{in the field of}} customs statistics of Georgia and to formulate concrete steps for their correction. Methodology/methodsThe methods of induction, deduction, analysis, synthesis, statistical observation and grouping have been used in the research process. The aim of the scientific work is to determine the principles for improving the statistical registration of commodity at the customs in Georgia. ResultsCountries of origin are not yet completely reflected in the cargo-customs declaration at the Georgian customs; the field ``means of transport at the border'' in the cargo-customs declaration is not filled in; data on estimated market value of the means of transport in the databases of Service Agency of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia is not complete; detailed coding of imported vehicles is carried out incorrectly; the simplified customs declarations are not completely filled in with reference to countries, 11 -digit item coding and value. In terms of registration, certain problems are caused by the fact that a sender and a <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>final</b> <b>destination</b> are not always filled out in the declaration. Problems exist in producing foreign trade price indices, the issue being that he information on foreign trade statistics is classified according to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System while price indices are calculated according to the classification of types of economic activity on the 4 -digit level; in filling in declarations there are frequent errors related to registration of commodity code, weight and additional units of measurement. ConclusionsEmpirical data related to production of Foreign Trade Statistics are characterized with certain errors, as a part of foreign trade operations remains unregistered. It means that registered value of exports and imports does not fully correspond to the value of actual flows...|$|E

40|$|China´s {{interests}} in Central Asia were propelled, with {{the launching of}} the initiative “One Belt, One Road”, renamed as “The Belt and Road Initiative”, {{better known as the}} New Silk Road. Thanks to the infrastructure investment China will become interconnected with other regions of the world, breaking up its secular isolation and will send its products to the global market more easily by land and sea. One principal question in this revolutionary change has to do with China´s hypothetical second intentions of geopolitical influence on the countries affected by the new routes (<b>countries</b> <b>of</b> transit or <b>final</b> <b>destination).</b> The article tries to answer the following questions: Does the People's Republic of China aim only to revive its internal labour market, reduce its industrial overcapacity and boost its exports? Is globalization coming to an end or is it entering a new phase of interconnectivity? How does this affect the relations between Russia and China in the Asian region...|$|R

50|$|Development of {{the film}} began shortly after the release <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> <b>Destination</b> 2, though Jeffrey Reddick, who was {{the creator of the}} {{franchise}} and a co-writer <b>of</b> 2000's <b>Final</b> <b>Destination</b> and 2003's <b>Final</b> <b>Destination</b> 2, did not return for <b>Final</b> <b>Destination</b> 3. In contrast to the previous film, which was a direct sequel to the original, <b>Final</b> <b>Destination</b> 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel, with the idea of featuring a roller-coaster derailment as the opening-scene disaster coming from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant. From the beginning, Wong and Morgan placed control as a major theme in the film. Casting began in March 2005, with Winstead and Merriman landing the lead roles, and concluded in April. <b>Final</b> <b>Destination</b> 3 was filmed in Vancouver, as with the previous two installments, over a three-month period; the first two weeks were spent entirely on filming the roller-coaster's derailment.|$|R
5|$|<b>Final</b> <b>Destination</b> 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> <b>Destination</b> 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, <b>Final</b> <b>Destination</b> 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> <b>Destination,</b> or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|R

5000|$|According to Heisserer, <b>Final</b> <b>Destination</b> 5 {{was always}} {{meant to be}} a prequel, set before the first film; the idea having come from {{franchise}} producer Craig Perry. Heisserer said that one major problem he encountered while writing the film was coming up with good death sequences, believing that managing {{to do so in the}} world <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> <b>Destination</b> is [...] "ridiculously hard".
