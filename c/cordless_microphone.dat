50|$|The Round Barn Theatre is a non-Equity {{regional}} theatre {{located in}} Nappanee, Indiana. It {{is part of}} Amish Acres, a historic farm and heritage resort. Amish Acres is owned by founders Richard and Susan Pletcher. Jennifer Wysong serves as president. The Pletchers are the producers of The Round Barn Theatre. The building is a round barn built in 1911 that was dismantled and relocated at the farm in 1998. It was moved twelve miles (19 km) from its original location. To meet state building codes a thirty-two ton six-inch (152 mm) tubular steel frame was erected and the original studs, compression rings, rafters, and cupola were reassembled attached to the frame. The barn is sixty feet in diameter and stands sixty feet tall {{to the top of}} the cupola. Insulation is sandwiched between new barn siding inside and outside the frame. A post and beam straw shed that was added to the structure shortly after its construction was also moved intact to become the proscenium stage for the theatre. Robert Holdeman, AIA, of Traverse City, Michigan designed the plans that converted the barn into a state of the art performing arts center. Ninety-six dimmer circuits provide theatre lighting and a sound system using Audiotechnica <b>cordless</b> <b>microphones</b> provide the required tools for the lighting and sound designers. The stage is outfitted with a counterweight fly system. The orchestra is housed in a loft open to the audience. The seating capacity in the orchestra, mezzanine, and balcony is four hundred.|$|R
