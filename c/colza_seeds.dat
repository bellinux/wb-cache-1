40|$|The fat {{of mixture}} of goat and cow milk, {{extracted}} by di-ethylic ether, was gas chromatographically analysed {{in order to}} propose an analytical procedure suitable to reveal small additions of cow milk to goat milk. The obtained results show evident differences in the percentages of some fatty acids. An attempt to apply the peak area ratios, corresponding to the methyl esters of fatty acids, suggested by the literature for cow milk did not yield good results. Other ratios suitable to reveal even the presence of low percentages (up to 5 %) of cow milk in goat milk were found and proposed in this paper. Such ratios are sensitive and can be defined markers towards cow or goat milk and also towards extraneous fat like lard or <b>colza</b> <b>seeds</b> oil...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} initial {{parameters}} such as inlet gas temperature, initial particles temperature and gas velocity on temperature changes of solid particles and outlet gas temperature in a fluidized bed dryer was studied. For testing, an experimental setup was established. With combination of air and <b>Colza</b> <b>seeds</b> belonging to D groups of the Geldart classification (Geldart, 1986) fluidization regime was carried out. With five test series with maintaining the inlet gas temperature, solid particle temperature and outlet gas temperature during time were carefully measured. To analyze these data by using regression analysis to predict solid particle and outlet gas temperature, 2 correlations on initial pa-rameters were presented. The result has shown that temperature gradients {{in the beginning of}} fluidization, is very high and therefore the exponential functions in the regression model is used to predict the temperature changes...|$|E

40|$|WOSTo get {{a better}} {{knowledge}} of discharging flows of ensiled granular materials, a small scale silo was designed and built. It {{is equipped with a}} flat bottom and it has a rectangular cross section. Moreover, it is entirely transparent for image processing purpose. First of all, a physical and mechanical characterization of wood granules (inert materials) was performed using a shear box testing. Then, silo emptying flows were generated. Flow regimes and flow rate were determined using spatiotemporal diagrams extracted from images of the free surface of the ensiled material. The same method was then used to measure the flow rate of discharging flows of soya, <b>colza</b> and rye <b>seeds</b> which were characterized in a previous study. For each material studied, the flow rate measured with this non intrusive method was successfully compared with a direct method consisting in weighing a volume of grains discharged during a unit time and with Berveloo's formula...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a {{characterization of the}} following dry granular materials: soya, <b>colza</b> and rye <b>seeds.</b> The physical properties of the grains and the materials are useful for characterizing the materials' behaviour during flow, while the external conditions (consolidation) determine storage and handling conditions. The physical properties of the grains (specific densities) and of the materials as a whole (compacity or porosity, and critical angles) were measured. The flow functions were determined by modified shear box testing. Then the internal friction angles and the flowability index for each granular material were obtained. Indeed, the behaviour of a flowing granular material results from these two groups of factors and {{is characterized by the}} flowability, which is the ratio of highest consolidation stress and unconfined yield strength. In practice, the flowability index is used to classify materials, so that the larger the flowability index, the smaller the bulk solids strength will be in relation to the consolidation stress, and therefore the higher the flowability of the bulk solid...|$|R
6000|$|The other {{cultivated}} {{forms of}} the genus Brassica are descended, according to the view adopted by Godron and Metzger (9/75. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 54; Metzger 'Kohlarten' s. 10.), from two species, B. napus and rapa; but according to other botanists from three species; whilst others again strongly suspect that all these forms, both wild and cultivated, ought to be ranked as a single species. Brassica napus {{has given rise to}} two large groups, namely, Swedish turnips (believed to be of hybrid origin) (9/76. 'Gardener's Chronicle and Agricult. Gazette' 1856 page 729. See more especially ibid 1868 page 275: the writer asserts that he planted a variety of cabbage (B. oleracea) close to turnips (B. rapa) and raised from the crossed seedlings true Swedish turnips. These latter plants ought, therefore, to be classed with cabbages or turnips, and not under B. napus.) and <b>Colzas,</b> the <b>seeds</b> of which yield oil. Brassica rapa (of Koch) has also given rise to two races, namely, common turnips and the oil-giving rape. The evidence is unusually clear that these latter plants, though so different in external appearance, belong to the same species; for the turnip has been observed by Koch and Godron to lose its thick roots in uncultivated soil; and when rape and turnips are sown together they cross {{to such a degree that}} scarcely a single plant comes true. (9/77. 'Gardener's Chronicle and Agricult. Gazette' 1855 page 730.) Metzger by culture converted the biennial or winter rape into the annual or summer rape,--varieties which have been thought by some authors to be specifically distinct. (9/78. Metzger, 'Kohlarten' s. 51.) ...|$|R
