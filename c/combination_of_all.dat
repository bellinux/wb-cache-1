5|$|Changes in {{direction}} {{of this nature}} are most commonly observed {{as a result of}} a cyclone's interaction with other low pressure systems, troughs, ridges, or with anticyclones. A strong and stationary anticyclone can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone. Such blocking patterns are quite normal, and will generally result in a weakening of the cyclone, the weakening of the anticyclone, a diversion of the cyclone towards the anticyclone's periphery, or a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> three to some extent depending on the precise conditions. It is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in these circumstances.|$|E

Chromatograms of A.bradleyi showed a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the compounds found in A.montanum {{and all those}} in A.platyneuron. A.×wherryi showed the same pattern, as it also contains chromosomes from both of those species. A specimen of A.stotleri was subsequently shown to form the same chromatograms as well. This showed {{that it was not}} descended to A.pinnatifidum, whose chromatograms contain compounds inherited from walking fern (A.rhizophyllum), and verified that A.stotleri was simply a form of A.bradleyi. Allozyme analysis in the 1980s also supported these hybrid origins of A.bradleyi.|$|E

40|$|A query {{result of}} an XML keyword search is usually defined {{as a set of}} the most {{specific}} elements containing all query keywords. Search systems find the query result by considering the <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> elements in the inverted indexes of the query keywords. However, we conclude that {{it is not necessary to}} consider the <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the elements, when an “effective result depth” (which represents how deeply nested elements are eligible for the query result) is given. This paper describes a way to construct partitioned indexes on the effective result depth, guaranteeing that the <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> elements in different partitions never produce result elements. Therefore, search systems can find query results by considering only <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> elements in the same partitions. Partitioned indexes are adaptable; when an effective result depth is changed, partitioned indexes constructed on the original depth can be used efficiently without being reconstructed physically on the changed depth. The experimental results show that our approach worked quite well in most cases...|$|R

25|$|From the {{beginning}} of his literary career, Machen espoused a mystical belief that the humdrum ordinary world hid a more mysterious and strange world beyond.
