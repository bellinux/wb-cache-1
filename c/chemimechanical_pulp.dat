The ratio of pectin removal reached 53. 73 % after pretreatment with 3 % sodium oxalate. When the parameters of precondition were 3 % sodium oxalate, 90 °C, and bleaching with 6. 5 % NaOH and 11 % H 2 O 2, the brightness of <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> from whole cotton stalk reached 76. 18 % ISO...|$|E
40|$|Process models {{based on}} data from close to one hundred pilot scale pulping runs are used to {{investigate}} strategies for operating a <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> mill. Optimal values for a total of 55 process and pulp quality variables have been calculated by applying a genetic algorithm search to a fuzzy model of the overall system. This model consists of over 90 distinct empirical relationships. Results indicate that pulp quality is maintained at minimal fibre and energy costs when the chemical pretreatment is conducted at moderately low temperature using a high SO 2 concentration producing both high sulphonation and high yield simultaneously. Subsequent refining should involve applying at least 65 % of the total energy in the primary stage. The pulp quality obtained is comparable to that of a CTMP pulp but with the added benefit of higher freeness...|$|E
40|$|A second-order PLS {{model has}} been {{calculated}} to study the impact of two-stage refining on the standard handsheet properties of a <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> {{as well as the}} effect on fiber length distribution and whole pulp specific surface. For a certain ratio of specific energy to refining intensity in the first stage, specific surface can be developed without loss in average fiber length. Fine material is peeled primarily from the middle fiber fractions in the first stage of refining, when high energy levels are distributed over a large number of impacts. While increases in refining intensify may be substituted for increases in applied energy to maintain adequate fiber length, whole pulp specific surface benefits most from higher energy levels applied at low intensity. Minimizing energy requirements by increasing intensity in the first refining stage is therefore better suited to the suffer fibers common to TMP pulping...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of aspen in <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> increased significantly {{during the last}} decade. There {{are a number of}} technologies now available for <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> of aspen, the two most popular being BCTMP and APMP. The former involves impregnation with alkaline sulphite (AS) and the latter with alkaline peroxide (AP) chemicals. Results from these two processes have been previously reported on aspen chips in terms of pulp property/energy requirements [1], and intrinsic relationships [2]. It is well understood that to reduce energy consumption in refiner mechanical pulping of aspen, some kind of alkali pre-treatment is needed [3]. Over {{the course of the last}} decade, the use of alkaline peroxide in the chip impregnation stage(s) has seen an increase in both development and commercial application. A large number of alkaline chip impregnation studies at atmospheric refining conditions, such as APMP and APP, have been conducted on hardwood species [2, 4 - 7]. The large increase in hardwood utilization by the paper industry during the 1990 s is one explanation for the rapid progression to commercial installation of a number of BCTMP and APMP (APP) mills for use in market pulp and/or integrated printing paper applications. The installed hardwood <b>chemimechanical</b> market <b>pulp</b> capacity increased from less than 10 % in 1989 to 54 % of capacity by 1999 [8]. This paper reviews several process configurations available for alkaline peroxide mechanical pulping of aspen. The process configurations include atmospheric refining (APMP), pressurized refining (AP-TMP) and a combination of atmospheric and pressurized refining (P-RC). Results from the most recent configuration (P-RC) are presented and discussed in terms of pulp property development and compared to an APMP pulp series produced from the same aspen chip furnish...|$|R
30|$|No {{information}} has been found regarding {{the application of the}} system CuO/γ-Al 2 O 3 -H 2 O 2 on effluents from the industrial alkaline sulfite treatment of wood, known as <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulping.</b> As these processes do not have a chemical recovery system, spent liquors are generally discharged into the receiving body. The catalytic oxidation of mixed recalcitrant compounds in industrial effluents is unusual because of the complexity of the effluents and the high costs involved in the total mineralization of the organic matter. Nevertheless, the conversion of recalcitrant to easily degradable compounds and the recovery of the catalysts can make the difference. Therefore, the study of the behavior of the industrial effluent with this oxidative system and the determination of the kinetic parameters for its application is a key step for the subsequent design of a treatment plant.|$|R
40|$|This review {{will focus}} on recent {{progress}} regarding the mechanisms of light-induced discoloration of mechanical and <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> and on the proposed preventive treatments. It is evident that the mechanisms behind photoyellowing of lignin-rich pulps are complex and that several types of reaction pathways may coexist. Photoyellowing proceeds via one initial fast phase and a slower following phase. The fast phase has been ascribed to oxidation of free phenolic groups and/or hydroquinones and catechols to photoproducts of mainly quinonoid character. A multitude of reactions involving several lignin subunits are possible. Important intermediates are phenoxyl radicals, {{and to some extent}} ketyl radicals. The importance of the phenacyl aryl ether pathway might be more important than previously thought, even though the original content of such groups is low in lignin. Even though many preventive methods against photoyellowing have been suggested, no cost-efficient treatment is available to hinder photoreversion of lignin-containing paper permanently. Suggested methods for stabilization include chemical modification (etherification and esterification), coating the paper product, addition of radical scavengers, excited state quenchers, or ultraviolet absorbing compounds...|$|R

In this study, the effect of recycling on {{physical and chemical properties}} of <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (CMP) and neutral sulfite semi-chemical (NSSC) pulp was evaluated. The pulps were recycled three times. Hornification was measured by Water retention value. The results indicated that water retention value and carboxyl groups were decreased due to recycling, hornification also increased during cycles of wetting and drying. Changes in crystalline structure of the pulp during first cycle of recycling were investigated by ATR- FTIR. The crystallinity index increased to some extent, when compared to virgin pulp. Recycling influence on the fiber length was not significant. Hornification introduced as a main cause of poor properties of recycled paper.

40|$|Effects of {{ultrasonic}} pretreatment on the bleaching of <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (CMP) {{fiber of}} triploid Chinese white Poplar were investigated. Before single-stage hydrogen peroxide bleaching, CMP was sonicated at 1. 5 % pulp consistency and 50 oC for 20 min with 90 % amplitude and 20 s pulse; these conditions showed {{the most favorable}} effect of a 3. 5 % ISO increase of brightness, reaching a final value of 80. 2 % ISO. The benefit may be because the ultrasound can accelerate heterogeneous reactions, which arise from the impingement of microjets and shockwaves on the solid surface, which are then capable of inducing striking changes in surface morphology, composition, and reactivity. To prove the theory, the surface structure and surface morphology were investigated by SEM and AFM, and the crystalline structure and characteristics of the cellulose in terms of XRD and FT-IR were also evaluated...|$|E
40|$|A mild acidic dioxane {{extraction}} {{method was}} employed to isolate lignin from hardwood bleached <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (BCMP). The isolated lignin was then purified and undergone elemental analysis. To study the photodegradation behavior, the lignin samples were impregnated onto the Whatman filter papers and irradiated with UV light for various periods. The photolyzed lignin was then recovered and analyzed by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. Phenylpropane-based formula (C 9) of CMP pulp lignin and the photolyzed samples were then established with elemental analysis and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy data. The {{results indicated that the}} benzaldehyde and benzoic acid type compounds were the main photodegradation products of BCMP lignin. The lignin photodegradation probably involved the degradation of phenylcoumaran units. Irradiation also increased the phenolic hydroxyl group content and decreased that of methoxyl groups, due to demethoxylation. The degrees of aromatic ring condensation were increased upon continuing the irradiation time, which imples the formation of condensed structures in photolyzed lignin...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the effect of ozone, either alone or {{combined}} with an activated sludge system, on {{the reduction of the}} recalcitrant COD in the effluent of a <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> (NaOH -Na 2 SO 3) integrated mill. Several alternative schemes involving ozonation were tested on liquors and effluents of the pulp mill, and on two kinds of effluents were taken at different points of an activated sludge pilot plant. The largest decrease in COD was 33 %, whereas that in aromatic compounds (absorbance at 232. 5 nm) was of 73 %. The most obvious result of the ozone treatment was effluent decolorization. It was not possible to use ozonation as tertiary treatment, as ozone was necessary to treat the BOD generated, and therefore the effluent must necessarily pass through a biological treatment. With a scheme including an intermediate ozonation between two secondary treatments (post-activated sludge and pre-aeration lagoon), the maximum reductions achieved were of 70 % in COD, of 93 % in aromatics, and of 96 % in color...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis was {{to find ways to}} {{maintain}} a low level of light‐induceddiscolouration at an increased addition of mechanical and <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> in coated highqualityfine paper and magazine paper grades. Current technology allows the production of highyieldpulps such as thermomechanical and <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> with properties suitable formanufacturing high‐quality paper or paperboard with a low basis weight. Coating of woodcontainingpaper will probably be necessary for photo‐stability reasons if lignin‐containing pulps areto be used as the main fibre furnish in long‐life and high‐value products. In order to find the most suitable pulp for this purpose, light‐induced discolouration of a variety ofpaper samples from unbleached and bleached softwood and hardwood pulps was studied under bothaccelerated and long‐term ambient light‐induced ageing conditions. Hardwood high‐yield pulps,especially aspen pulps, were proven to be more photo‐stable compared to softwood pulps. Hardwoodpulps should therefore be the first choice for applications where a high permanence is desirable. Evaluating ageing characteristics using the CIELAB colour system showed that accelerated ageingconditions tend to mainly increase the b* value and decrease the L* value (i. e. yellow the pulp),whereas long‐term ambient ageing also increases the a* value, which makes the pulp more reddish. A new method for studying the influence of the UV‐screening properties of coating layers on abase paper was developed, and used to investigate the effect of pigment, pigment size distribution,binder and UV‐absorbing additives. The coat weight and pigment type were found to be the mostimportant factors for reducing the transmittance of UV‐radiation. Coating colours containing kaolinpigments had a lower UV‐transmittance than calcium carbonate pigments. Of the calcium carbonates,precipitated calcium carbonates were better than ground calcium carbonates and the difference wasgreater at higher coat weights. The particle size distribution should preferable be narrow. When thebest pigment (bleached kaolin) and the best binder (styrene butadiene latex) were combined withtitanium dioxide, the UV‐transmittance could be reduced by about 90 % at a coat weight of ~ 10 g/m 2. At a coat weight close to 20 g/m 2, the transmittance was close to zero. This shows that it is possible tomore or less fully protect a double coated base paper from harmful UV‐radiation, when the coatinglayer has an optimum composition for that purpose. A prerequisite to reach so far is that the coatinglayer has an even coat weight...|$|R

Plate gap and consistency in each stage was controlled according to a central composite design. Statistical models of refiner performance were constructed from these experimental results and a non-linear optimization of process conditions was conducted. Optimization results were verified with plant trials which indicate that increasing the ratio of specific energy applied in the first stage leads to a reduction of approximately 15 % in the total energy required. Inversely, this strategy can be used to obtain significant increases in pulp quality for a given energy input. The results also indicate that the largest proportion of energy must be applied to the fibres at high consistency...|$|E

Efficient inhibition of photo-yellowing of papers made from bagasse CMP {{was achieved by}} acetylation. The acetylated unbleached CMP was noticeably photo-bleached during irradiation. Sodium borohydride reduction followed by acetylation had the same effect as acetylation alone at {{the same degree of}} reaction time. The pre-reduced, acetylated unbleached papers were, however, not brightened during irradiation. The reductive treatment had little effect in reducing the photo-yellowing of paper made from CMP pulp; a small stabilization effect was observed in the case of bleached CMP, while unbleached CMP was slightly more prone to discolour in the later phase of photo-reversion. The improved stability towards light was closely related to the decrease in the phenolic hydroxyl content as a result of blocking by acetyl groups during treatment with acetic anhydride. The results support the hypothesis that phenolic hydroxyl has an impor-tant role in the process of photo-reversion of high-yield pulps...|$|E

40|$|Acid {{pretreatment}} of wood provides significant {{energy savings}} during refining but reduces {{the brightness of}} the pulp. Acid treatments also extract carbohydrates from wood. Addition of an acid pretreatment process to a thermomechanical pulping process therefore offers an opportunity to reduce refining energy cost and provide a secondary product from a fermentation ethanol plant. A process being investigated by BioPulping International and the Forest Products Laboratory involves pretreatment with oxalic acid or diethyl oxalate and offers 25 % or more reduction in specific refiner energy consumption, with a minor sacrifice in brightness. This treatment also results in extraction of approximately 6 % of the wood mass. Similarly, research during the late 1970 s on sulfonated <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> at low pH determined that bisulfite reduced specific refining energy, maintained brightness, and released carbohydrates. The similarity in behavior of these two pretreatments suggests a common mechanism {{that is the subject of}} this study. Our hypothesis is that both acids provide optimal conditions, either buffering at pH 2 or mildly reducing conditions, for pretreating wood. To test this hypothesis, a series of spruce and aspen veneer samples were pretreated with sodium bisulfate, sulfurous acid, and oxalic acid. These three acids can provide buffering near pH 2 and a range of redox potential. The wood chip brightness of the sodium bisulfate and oxalic acid experiments were similar but at a given yield sulfurous acid seems to preserve brightness better than does either bisulfate or oxalic acid. The redox activity does not seem to affect results...|$|R
40|$|When {{high yield}} <b>chemimechanical</b> {{sulphite}} <b>pulp</b> fibres were suspended in water, both lignin and carbohydrate were leached {{out of the}} pulp. The rate of leaching fitted a theory developed previously for the diffusion of macromolecules through the water-swollen fibre wall. The average intrafibre diffusion coefficients for lignin and carbohydrate were several orders of magnitude lower than the free diffusion of these macromolecules in solution. Leaching {{over a long period}} indicated a polydispersity of diffusion coefficients. This was related to an increase with time in the molecular weights of macromolecules removed from the fibre. Although the rate of leaching increased markedly with temperature, the diffusion coefficient of lignin decreased, while that of carbohydrate increased by a factor higher than that predicted by the Stokes-Einstein equation. These contrasting results were interpreted in terms of the molecular weights of the diffusing species and hydrogen bonding of carbohydrate to the fibre wall. The rate of leaching decreased with an increase in pulp yield, increasing cationic strength and pH of the wash water, decreasing refining energy, pretreatment of pulp with formaldehyde, and the use of polyethyleneoxide/alum retention aid in the wash water. Decreasing pH of the cooking liquor and the use of anthraquinone in the pulping increased the leaching of lignin but did not affect the leaching of carbohydrate. The effects observed could be related either to swelling or degradation of the fibre wall...|$|R
40|$|Unbleached and {{hydrogen}} peroxide bleached bagasse <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> wereacetylated in liquid phase {{in order to}} investigate the change in paper propertiesdue to chemical modification. The acetylation treatment was carried out on paper sheets and pulp samples. Effect of liquid phase acetylation on optical and mechanical properties of bagasse chemimechanical paper sheets was evaluated. The obtained results also indicated that acetylation is a reliable method to eliminate phenolic hydroxyl groups. Paper made from unbleached CMP increased in brightness (up to 10 percentage units) on acetylation, while the hydrogen peroxide bleached paper decreased in bright-ness. The acetylation treatment removed or inactivated some chromophores originally present in the unbleached CMP {{but not in the}} hydrogen peroxide bleached samples. The results showed that partial acetylation even for short period of times could cause consid-erable increase in wet strength of paper, due probably to lower equilibrium moisture con-tent. Also, other mechanical properties such as tear resistance and tensile strength were not affected to any great extent by acetylation in liquid phase providing that the paper sheet is acetylated instead of pulp. Present study proved that active phenolic hydroxyl functional groups present in pulp could be modified without losing mechanical strengths and optical behaviour of the paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the bleaching performance of a Mg(OH) 2 -based hydrogen peroxide process at a high consistency. In this work, an industrially produced <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (CMP) was bleached via Mg(OH) 2 - or NaOH-based hydrogen peroxide processes at 10 % and 25 % consistencies. The results showed that the pulp bleached under the conditions of 1. 5 % Mg(OH) 2 and 3 % H 2 O 2 at 25 % consistency had a similar brightness to, a lower yellowness index, and a higher opacity than the pulp produced under the conditions of 2. 1 % NaOH, 3 % Na 2 SiO 3, and 3 % H 2 O 2 at the same consistency. The temperature (70 ºC) and time (150 min) of the bleaching were the same for both processes. Under the conditions stated above, the Mg(OH) 2 -based process had a higher yield than the NaOH-based process did. The bleaching effluent of the Mg(OH) 2 -based process had a higher residual H 2 O 2, but a lower Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load and turbidity, compared with that of the NaOH-based process. However, the strength properties and water retention value (WRV) of the pulp bleached via the Mg(OH) 2 -based process were lower, while its bulk was higher than those of the pulp bleached via the NaOH-based process...|$|E
40|$|Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM) {{consisting}} of cationic starch and anionic carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) {{have been applied}} to different pulp fibres {{in order to enhance}} the out-of-plane sheet strength properties of a typical packaging board furnish. An unbleached softwood chemical pulp was treated with multilayers {{consisting of}} two layers of cationic starch and one layer of CMC, and then mixed with different mechanical and chemimechanical pulps. Hand sheets were prepared with the aid of the Rapid Köthen sheet former from stocks consisting of 20 % treated chemical pulp and 80 % mechanical or <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulp,</b> which was either PGW from spruce, HT-CTMP from spruce or birch, or a standard spruce CTMP. Multilayer treatment significantly improved Scott Bond values and in some cases improved the tensile index, with the achieved effects being significantly larger than the effects of applying starch alone. Positive effects were obtained by treating only 20 % of the furnish, showing a very high efficiency of the adsorbed multilayers. Compared to earlier work, one important finding was that the PEM treatment should preferably be applied only to the chemical pulp and not on the entire stock. It was possible to increase the out-of-plane strength properties, measured as Scott Bond values, with just a very small increase in density of the sheets. Multilayer treatment of the chemical pulp improved the joint strength between the fibres while maintaining the high bulk of the sheets prepared from the stiff mechanical and chemimechanical fibres...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out the reasons why the long fibres of mechanical pulp do not seem to reinforce paper as effectively as chemical reinforcement pulp. A preliminary laboratory trial showed that artificially increasing the average fibre length of TMP pulp by adding long fibres extracted from the same pulp increased the tear index, but decreased the tensile strength, internal bond strength and the fracture energy. Increasing the average fibre strength with chemical (NBSK) pulp fibres improved all of those properties considerably. In the second trial fibre properties and reinforcement ability of various mechanical pulps were investigated. It was shown that fibre dimensions of mechanical pulp fibres did not differ essentially from chemical pulp fibres. The biggest differences were in the properties characterizing the cell wall structure. This was clearly seen in fibre flexibility and fibre swelling (WRV), for instance. Mechanical pulp fibres are evidently more damaged than chemical pulp fibres which is seen as a much lower fibre strength (zero-span tensile strength). The reinforcement potential, on the grounds of fracture energy, tear strength and tensile strength of handsheets was much lower for mechanical pulp fibres than for chemical pulp. In the third trial, mechanical (MRP) and <b>chemimechanical</b> reinforcement <b>pulp</b> (CMRP) was manufactured from Norway spruce (P. abies) on a pilot scale. The focus was to increase fibre flexibility, bonding ability and maintain the fibre length and strength. The runnability of LWC base paper made from the trial pulps was tested using the KCL AHMA runnability tester. In spite of the good strength properties of the trial pulps, they did not have the same overall reinforcement ability than chemical pulp. The sulphonated trial pulp (CMRP) gave the same tensile stiffness and tensile strength as the chemical pulp. However, the fracture properties and extensibility of the paper was worse with it. The lower average length of the trial pulps did not explain the difference totally. Scaling the fibre length with the zero-span tensile strength improved the explanatory power essentially. It was concluded that the low fibre strength is the basic reason for the poorer reinforcement ability of mechanical pulps fibres over chemical ones...|$|R
40|$|A catalyzed chemimechanical-anthraquinone pulping {{of black}} spruce wood was {{investigated}} in this study. The effect of liquor pH on anthraquinone performance, AQ and mass transfer limitations on <b>chemimechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> properties {{and the effects of}} AQ, liquor pH and sulphite concentration on pulping kinetic were studied. It was observed that AQ was not an effective redox catalyst when added to the sulphite liquor at pH 4, but it was very effective at pH 7 and higher. When chemical treatment of chemimechanical pulping was done with the presence of AQ, the sulphur content of pulp was reduced due to preferential reaction of AQ with wood components. AQ, as a pulping agent, is much effective in increasing the delignification rate {{and at the same time}} protecting the degradation of carbohydrates. Pulps produced from wood wafers with cooking liquor at pH 7 containing 0. 1 % of AQ on oven dry wood, exhibited the following improved properties when compared with those prepared without addition of AQ: increased pulping rate, higher pulp yield and carbohydrates yield at the same level of residual lignin in pulp, and in addition, the strength properties such as breaking length and burst strength improved by 15 % even with a minimum AQ charge (0. 05 % and 0. 01 %). With regular wood chips, the penetration of sulphite seems to be superior to that of AQ. It was observed that AQ was not uniformly distributed in the impregnated wood chips even when the compression ratio was increased from 3. 5 : 1 to 5 : 1. The penetration of AQ into wood chips remains to be a major factor affecting the pulping rate and pulp properties (strength and brightness) in chemimechanical-AQ pulping. The rate of delignification in the initial phase of both sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking at pH 7 shows the second order reaction in the remaining lignin. The order with respect to sulphite concentration for sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking were estimated to be 0. 24 and 0. 31, respectively. The activation energies of delignification of the initial phase in sulphite and sulphite-AQ pulping were 90. 2 and 97. 5 kJ/mole which was valid up to 30 % lignin removal within the temperature range of 160 °C and 175 °C. AQ as a pulping additive introduced to the sulphite liquor increased the rate of delignification 1. 5 times in the initial phase of delignification during the sulphite cooking process. At initial pH of sulphite liquor ranging from 7 to 10, the rate of delignification in the initial phase during sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking appears to be a second order reaction in the remaining lignin. The reaction orders with respect to sulphite concentration increases when the initial pH is below 8 and decreases when the initial pH is above 8 for both sulphite and sulphite-AQ cooking. The raw of delignificafion is dependent on the initial pH of cooking liquor and the addition of AQ...|$|E
