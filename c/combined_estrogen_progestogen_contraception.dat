30|$|Of 198 women, 112 (56.6 %) {{had reached}} {{menopause}} during the follow-up period; 75 of them (67.0 %) used hormonal replacement therapy, 30 used a continuous <b>combined</b> <b>estrogen</b> and <b>progestogen</b> regimen or tibolone, 38 a cyclical combined regimen, 4 reported using only estrogen, and 3 {{had only a}} cyclical progestogen regimen. Of 38 women on a cyclical <b>combined</b> <b>estrogen</b> and <b>progestogen</b> regimen, 19 (52.6 %) {{reported that they were}} amenorrheic.|$|R
30|$|Most of {{the women}} in both groups avoided {{hysterectomy}} during the long follow-up period. Most of them had reached menopause. Postmenopausal women using a cyclic <b>combined</b> <b>estrogen</b> <b>progestogen</b> regimen may experience bleeding. In the present study, all subjects reported slight bleeding or amenorrhea. These findings indicate that the long-term impact is permanent and endometrial resection after use of LNG-IUS does not simply postpone hysterectomy and is also an alternative approach after failed use of LNG-IUS.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{due to the}} loss of {{inactivation}} of EE by 17β-HSD in the endometrium (uterus), EE is relatively more active than estradiol in the endometrium and, for this reason, is associated with a significantly lower incidence of vaginal bleeding and spotting in comparison. This is particularly so in the case of <b>combined</b> <b>estrogen</b> and <b>progestogen</b> therapy (as in COCs or menopausal HRT), as progestogens induce the expression of 17β-HSD in the endometrium. The reduced vaginal bleeding and spotting with EE {{is one of the main}} reasons that it is used in COCs instead of estradiol, in spite of its potentially inferior safety profile (related to its adverse effects on hepatic protein synthesis and VTE incidence).|$|R
30|$|About half of {{the women}} without {{hysterectomy}} had reached menopause during a long follow-up period, {{and many of them}} (67 %) were on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). <b>Combined</b> treatment with <b>estrogen</b> and <b>progestogen</b> was the most popular as it does not cause endometrial proliferation. Almost {{half of the}} postmenopausal women on cyclic <b>estrogen</b> and <b>progestogen</b> regimen had amenorrhea, showing good results after endometrial resection. Unopposed estrogen treatment is not recommended after endometrial ablation even where a woman has amenorrhea after endometrial resection. Endometrial cells are found in endometrial samples in women with amenorrhea after endometrial resection [13]. Istre and associates reported endometrial hyperplasia in women on an unopposed estrogen regimen [14]. Those receiving a continuous <b>combined</b> <b>estrogen</b> and <b>progestogen</b> regimen had no endometrial hyperplasia. Women who have undergone endometrial resection must follow the same guidelines during HRT for endometrial protection as women with an intact uterus [14]. Postmenopausal women after endometrial resection and receiving HRT should undergo measurement of endometrial thickness using transvaginal ultrasound at follow-up examinations. Those with postmenopausal bleeding should be checked by endometrial biopsy, as endometrial carcinoma has been reported after endometrial resection [15].|$|R
25|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs cause {{temporary}} {{regression of}} fibroids by decreasing estrogen levels. Because {{of the limitations}} and side effects of this medication, it is rarely recommended other than for preoperative use to shrink {{the size of the}} fibroids and uterus before surgery. It is typically used for a maximum of 6 months or less because after longer use they could cause osteoporosis and other typically postmenopausal complications. The main side effects are transient postmenopausal symptoms. In many cases the fibroids will regrow after cessation of treatment, however, significant benefits may persist for much longer in some cases. Several variations are possible, such as GnRH agonists with add-back regimens intended to decrease the adverse effects of estrogen deficiency.

40|$|It is very {{important}} to know the final hormonal 'climate' under which a woman who is taking hormonal contraception will live for long periods of time. Taking into consideration all observations that were made in this respect there is hardly any possibility that a <b>combined</b> <b>estrogen</b> <b>progestogen</b> antiestrogen pill could prove to be carcinogenetic. There is no reason to think at the present time that oral contraception could have any carcinogenetic effect. It is necessary to repeat, however, that as far as oral contraception is concerned the same difficulties are found in studying every new medicine when attempting to find out how carcinogenetic {{it is likely to be}} in human use. At the present time due to clinical prospective and retrospective studies that can be examined, all contraception has no carcinogenic action in the uterus concerning either the pavement epithelium of the exocervix or the endocervical mucosa or the endometrium. As far as the carcinogenetic effects of oral contraceptives on the breast are concerned it is feared both on theoretical and experimental grounds that the hormone imbalance which their use provokes could cause proliferation of cancerous cells that are already present. There is, at present no formal proof to support such a hypothesis. On the other hand all authors agree in stating that combination <b>estrogen</b> <b>progestogen</b> pills when used for oral contraception do not cause breast cancer. Considering the chance of an obnoxious action from the use of these combined hormone preparations, it is recommended that, before giving a prescription for them to anybody, that a complete medical examination should be carried out including a cancer screening of the uterus. A clinical examination and a thermographic and radiographic examination of the breasts should also be carried out. Furthermore, during treatment with the pills these examinations should be repeated at least once a year in order to be able to diagnose any cancerous lesion at the stage when it is still curable. In conclusion, the most serious studies of the action of the contraceptive pill to date have failed to show that such a pill is able to cause cancer in any of the hormone dependent organs.

40|$|THERE {{is a loss}} of {{skeletal}} muscle mass and strength, that is, sarcopenia, with age, and this loss contributes to in-creased risks for comorbidities related to falls, diminished ability to carry out activities of daily living, and an overall decreased quality of life (1). In addition to the age-induced loss of muscle strength, in women, {{there are reports of}} accel-erated rates of strength loss associated with menopause (2 – 4). Therefore, it is probable that changes in ovarian hormones due to menopause contribute to muscle weakness. To counter the loss of ovarian hormones, women have the option of taking hormone therapy (HT). In this article, we will use the term HT because it was recently recommended that this terminology be used for menopause-related therapies that encompass estro-gen therapy and <b>combined</b> <b>estrogen</b> – <b>progestogen</b> therapy (5, 6).

40|$|Background: At {{the time}} of {{feasibility}} work and final design of the trial there was no randomised control trial evidence for the long-term {{risks and benefits of}} hormone replacement therapy. Observational studies had suggested that long term use of estrogen was likely to be associated, amongst other things, with reduced risks of osteoporosis and ischaemic heart disease and increased risks of breast and endometrial cancer. Concomitant use of progestogens had been shown to protect against endometrial cancer, but there were few data showing how <b>progestogen</b> might affect <b>estrogen</b> actions on other conditions. Disease specific risks from observational studies suggested that, overall, long-term HRT was likely to be beneficial. Several studies showed that mortality from all causes was lower in HRT users than in non-users. Some secondary cardiovascular prevention trials were ongoing but evidence was also required for a range of outcomes in healthy women. The WISDOM trial was designed to compare <b>combined</b> <b>estrogen</b> and <b>progestogen</b> versus placebo, and <b>estrogen</b> alone versus <b>combined</b> <b>estrogen</b> and <b>progestogen.</b> During the development of WISDOM the Women's Health Initiative trial was designed, funded and started in the US. Design: Randomised, placebo, controlled, trial. Methods: The trial was set in general practices in the UK (384), Australia (94), and New Zealand (24). In these practices 284175 women aged 50 – 69 years were registered with 226282 potentially eligible. We sought to randomise 22300 postmenopausal women aged 50 – 69 and treat for ten years. The interventions were: conjugated equine estrogens, 0. 625 mg orally daily; conjugated equine estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2. 5 / 5. 0 mg orally daily; matched placebo. Primary outcome measures were: major cardiovascular disease, osteoporotic fractures, breast cancer and dementia. Secondary outcomes were: other cancers, all cause death, venous thromboembolism and cerebro-vascular disease. Results: The trial was prematurely closed during recruitment following publication of early results from the Women's Health Initiative. At {{the time of}} closure, 56583 had been screened, 8980 entered run-in, and 5694 (26 % of target of 22, 300) randomised. Those women randomised had received a mean of one year of therapy, mean age was 62. 8 years and total follow-up time was 6491 person years. Discussion: The WISDOM experience leads to some simple messages. The larger a trial is the more simple it needs to be to ensure cost effective and timely delivery.

50|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are frequently}} used first {{in patients with}} pelvic pain, particularly if the diagnosis of endometriosis has not been definitively (excision and biopsy) established. The goal of directed medical treatment is to achieve an anovulatory state. Typically, this is achieved initially using hormonal contraception. This can also be accomplished with progestational agents (i.e., medroxyprogesterone acetate), danazol, gestrinone, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH), {{as well as other}} less well-known agents. These agents are generally used if oral contraceptives and NSAIDs are ineffective. GnRH can be <b>combined</b> with <b>estrogen</b> and <b>progestogen</b> (add-back therapy) without loss of efficacy but with fewer hypoestrogenic symptoms. These medications are often ineffective in treating endometriomas and any relief is short lived while taking the medications. Hormonal treatment has a large number of sometimes permanent side effects, such as hot flushes, loss of bone mass, deepening of voice, weight gain, and facial hair growth.|$|R
40|$|Can we {{prescribe}} {{hormone replacement}} therapy (HRT) safely for women, with postmenopausal complaints who were treated for a gynaecological malignancy? Only three retrospective studies have investigated this issue in endometrial cancer patients. No recurrences or deaths occurred in these treated groups. However, the physician introduced bias through the selection of favourable groups. At present, <b>combined</b> <b>estrogen</b> and <b>progestogen</b> therapy is probably not contra-indicated in endometrial cancer stage I and probably also not in stage II, although so far there is only circumstantial evidence. Squamous cell cancers of the cervix, vulva, and vagina {{are unlikely to be}} influenced by HRT. In the only study available of women with ovarian cancer, 550 years, estrogen replacement therapy did not have a negative influence on (disease-free) survival. According to the data currently available, no evidence exists that HRT adversely influences survival and overall survival after treatment for ovarian cancer. In general, adenocarcinomas of the cervix and leiomyosarcomas of the uterus may be managed such as the adenocarcinomas of the uterus. During the last 25 years, HRT has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, osteoporotic fractures and colon carcinoma. On the other hand there is a significant increase of the risk in breast cancer with prolonged use of years. Re-evaluation of the current view that HRT should no be given to women treated for a gynaecological malignancy is strongly warranted after evaluating the advantages and the disadvantages of HRT use in each individual patient.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether tapering down of <b>combined</b> <b>estrogen</b> plus <b>progestogen</b> therapy (EPT) reduced the recurrence of hot flashes and resumption of therapy compared with abrupt discontinuation. A secondary aim was to evaluate whether health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was affected after discontinuation of EPT and to investigate the possible factors predicting resumption of EPT. METHODS:: Eighty-one postmenopausal women undergoing EPT because of hot flashes were randomized to tapering down or abrupt discontinuation of EPT. Vasomotor symptoms were recorded in self-registered diaries, and resumption of hormone therapy (HT) was asked for at every follow-up. The Psychological General Well-being Index was used to assess HRQoL. RESULTS:: Neither the number nor the severity of hot flashes or HRQoL or frequency of resumption of HT differed between the two modes of discontinuation of EPT during up to 12 months of follow-up. About every other woman had resumed HT within 1 year. Women who resumed HT after 4 or 12 months reported more deteriorated HRQoL and more severe hot flashes after discontinuation of therapy than did women who did not resume HT. CONCLUSIONS:: Women who initiate EPT because of hot flashes may experience recurrence of vasomotor symptoms and impaired HRQoL after discontinuation of EPT regardless of the discontinuation method used, abrupt or taper down. Because, in addition to severity of flashes, decreased well-being was the main predictor of the risk to resume HT, it seems important to also discuss quality of life in parallel with efforts to discontinue HT.

40|$|Hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) remains {{the gold standard}} for treatment of climacteric symptoms in menopausal women; it is relatively safe in healthy subjects for at least 5 years, provided it had been initiated before the age of 60 years and/or within 10 years from menopause. Estrogen probably adds some cardioprotection, that can, however, be obscured by progestogens, especially medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Oral HRT is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), gallbladder disease and possibly stroke. The increased occurrence of all these events can be prevented by the use of the transdermal route of estradiol administration; this route seems also advantageous for women with diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors, and also especially with advancing age. Endometrial protection by any progestogen is insufficient in the mid to long term when cyclical, sequential regimens are used; full protection can be secured only by continuous <b>combined</b> <b>estrogen</b> + <b>progestogen.</b> Natural, 'body-identical' progesterone, devoid of any androgenic as well as glucocorticoid activities but being slightly hypotensive due to its antimineralocorticoid activity, appears to be the optimal progestogen in terms of cardiovascular effects, blood pressure, VTE, probably stroke and even breast cancer (contrary to synthetic progestogens and particularly MPA, which appear to be mitogenic on breast cells, in synergism with estrogen). HRT optimization can thus be achieved by combining low doses of estrogen given transdermally with micronized oral progesterone; such optimized HRT will allow us to treat symptomatic women for as long as required. Asymptomatic women at risk of (osteoporotic) fractures can also be treated with this optimized HRT as long as their individual risk/benefit ratio remains favorable (thanks to the absence of increased risks of VTE, stroke and breast cancer). © 2013 International Menopause Society.

40|$|Background: Estrogen {{replacement}} therapy in postmenopausal women {{reduces the risk}} of coronary artery disease. One of the possible mechanisms of this effect is the modification of lipid profiles. However, there is controversy concerning the effects on lipoprotein(a) [Lp (a) ] and lipid levels of <b>progestogens</b> administered with <b>estrogen.</b> Methods: Five hundred fifty-one postmenopausal women were divided into 5 groups: group 1, 0. 625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) (n= 140) group 2, 0. 625 mg of CEE plus 5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (n= 97) group 3, 0. 625 mg of CEE plus 10 mg of MPA (n= 109) group 4, 2 mg of estradiol valerate plus 0. 5 mg of norgestrel (n= 134) and group 5, control (n= 71). The Lp(a) and lipid levels were measured before and 2, 6, and 12 months after hormone {{replacement therapy}}. Results: Estrogen replacement therapy for 12 months lowered the Lp(a) level by 37. 1 %. The addition of progestogen attenuated the Lp(a) -lowering effect of estrogen. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level was markedly increased in group 1 (16. 5 %), was moderately increased in groups 2 (10. 8 %) and 3 (11. 3 %), and was not changed in group 4. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was decreased by 10. 9 % to 17. 6 % in all the treatment groups. Estrogen replacement therapy for 2, 6, and 12 months raised the HDL-C level by 7. 2 %, 17. 4 %, and 17. 8 %, respectively. In the group with combined estradiol plus norgestrel therapy, the HDL-C level was decreased after 2 months and was not changed after 6 and 12 months. The groups that received CEE plus MPA showed intermediate effects between the group that received CEE only and the group that received estradiol plus norgestrel. Conclusions: <b>Combined</b> <b>estrogen</b> and <b>progestogen</b> therapy may have effects on the heart different from those of estrogen therapy alone because of adverse impact of progestogens on Lp(a) and HDL-C levels.

Patients and methods: We studied 289 consecutive patients who visited epilepsy outpatient clinic (University Hospital of Krakow) and met inclusion criteria. All patients were screened with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and those with BDI score ≥ 12 were further evaluated by a psychiatrist. Results: Mean age of patients was 35. 7 years, and mean duration of epilepsy was 14. 7  years. Idiopathic generalized epilepsy was diagnosed in 63 patients (21. 8 %), focal epilepsy was found in 189 subjects (65. 4 %), and unclassified epilepsy was diagnosed in 37 patients (12. 8 %). Frequent seizures (> 1 per month) were reported in 107 patients (37. 0 %). Thirty-five patients (12. 1 %) reported an ongoing treatment with one or more of the predefined potentially depressogenic medication (ß-blockers, <b>combined</b> <b>estrogen</b> and <b>progestogen,</b> corticosteroid, or flunarizine).

Only 20 of those patients (23. 8 %) were treated with antidepressant. Independent variables associated with the diagnosis of depression in the logistic regression model included frequent seizures (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 43 [95 % confidence interval, 95 % CI = 1. 38 – 4. 29], P= 0. 002), use of potentially depression-inducing medications (OR = 3. 33 [95 % CI = 1. 50 – 7. 39], P= 0. 003), age (OR = 1. 03 [95 % CI = 1. 01 – 1. 05] per year], P= 0. 005), and use of oxcarbazepine (OR = 2. 26 [95 % CI = 1. 04 – 4. 9], P= 0. 038).

Studies of the effect of HRT and tibolone on Lp(a) concentrations in post-menopausal women are reviewed in this meta-analysis. Design and methods: MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched (up to February 10, 2017). Two researchers identified randomized controlled studies and extracted data. Potential controversies were resolved by a third reviewer. Results: In 24 eligible studies, HRT caused a significant reduction in Lp(a) concentrations compared with placebo or no treatment [mean relative difference: − 20. 35 %, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : − 25. 33 % to − 15. 37 %, p < 0. 0001], with significant heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 98. 5 %), but without evidence of publication bias.
