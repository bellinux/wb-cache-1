25|$|The species fractus shows {{variable}} instability {{because it}} can be a subdivision of genus-types of different physical forms that have different stability characteristics. This subtype can be in the form of ragged but mostly stable stratiform sheets (stratus fractus) or small ragged cumuliform heaps with somewhat greater instability (<b>cumulus</b> <b>fractus).</b> When they form at low altitudes, stratiform and cumuliform genus-types can be torn up into shreds by brisk low level winds that create mechanical turbulence against the ground. Fractus clouds can form in precipitation at low altitudes, with or without brisk or gusty winds. They are closely associated with precipitating cloud systems of considerable vertical and sometimes horizontal extent, so they are also classified as accessory clouds under the name pannus (see section on supplementary features).|$|E

Cumulus humilis clouds look like puffy, flattened shapes. Cumulus mediocris clouds look similar, except that they have some vertical development.

50|$|Fractus are {{accessory}} clouds, {{named for}} the type of cloud from which they were sheared. The two principal forms are <b>cumulus</b> <b>fractus</b> (formerly, fractocumulus) and stratus fractus (formerly, fractostratus). Fractus clouds may develop into cumulus if the ground heats enough to start convection. Stratus fractus is distinguishable from <b>cumulus</b> <b>fractus</b> by its smaller vertical extent, darker color, and by the greater dispersion of its particles.|$|E

5000|$|The rotor may {{generate}} cumulus or <b>cumulus</b> <b>fractus</b> in its upwelling portion, {{also known}} as a [...] "roll cloud". The rotor cloud looks like a line of cumulus. It forms on the lee side and parallel to the ridge line. Its base is near the height of the mountain peak, though the top can extend well above the peak and can merge with the lenticular clouds above. Rotor clouds have ragged leeward edges and are dangerously turbulent.|$|E

40|$|Diabatic heating (or Q 1) {{profiles}} {{associated with}} specific cloud types {{are produced by}} matching synoptic cloud observations with a sounding budget analysis during the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Kwajalein Experiment (KWAJEX), {{which took place in}} the Marshall Islands from late July through mid-September 1999. Fair-weather cumulus clouds produce up to 1 K day 1 of heating below 850 hPa and are associated with cooling throughout {{much of the rest of}} the troposphere. Cumulus congestus clouds produce heating on the order of 1 K day 1 up to 575 hPa and cooling in the mid- to upper troposphere. Cumulonimbus clouds produce heating through the depth of the troposphere, with a maximum of 3. 7 K day 1 near 550 hPa. Cloud types indicating widespread rain (stratus or <b>cumulus</b> <b>fractus</b> of bad weather at low levels and nimbostratus at midlevels) have the largest and most elevated heating, with values 10 K day 1 above 600 hPa. Other mid- and high-level cloud types are shown to be consistent with area-averaged rain rates and Q 1 profiles. Profiles of the divergence and apparent moisture sink (or Q 2) for convective clouds are also analyzed and are shown to be consistent with the physics of the heating profiles just described. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we present}} a novel method of {{identifying}} and geolocalizing cloud field elements from a portable all-sky camera stereo network based {{on the ground and}} oriented towards zenith. The methodology is mainly based on stereophotogrammetry which is a 3 D reconstruction technique based on triangulation from corresponding stereo pixels in rectified images. In cases where clouds are horizontally separated, identifying individual positions is performed with segmentation techniques based on hue filtering and contour detection algorithms. Macroscopic cloud field characteristics such as cloud layer base heights and velocity fields are also deduced. In addition, the methodology is fitted to the context of measurement campaigns which impose simplicity of implementation, auto-calibration, and portability. Camera internal geometry models are achieved a priori in the laboratory and validated to ensure a certain accuracy in the peripheral parts of the all-sky image. Then, stereophotogrammetry with dense 3 D reconstruction is applied with cameras spaced 150  m apart for two validation cases. The first validation case is carried out with cumulus clouds having a cloud base height at 1500  m a. g. l. The second validation case is carried out with two cloud layers: a <b>cumulus</b> <b>fractus</b> layer with a base height at 1000  m a. g. l. and an altocumulus stratiformis layer with a base height of 2300  m a. g. l. Velocity fields at cloud base are computed by tracking image rectangular patterns through successive shots. The height uncertainty is estimated by comparison with a Vaïsala CL 31 ceilometer located on the site. The uncertainty on the horizontal coordinates and on the velocity field are theoretically quantified by using the experimental uncertainties of the cloud base height and camera orientation. In the first cumulus case, segmentation of the image is performed to identify individuals clouds in the cloud field and determine the horizontal positions of the cloud centers...|$|E
