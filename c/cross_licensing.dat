50|$|One of the {{limitations}} of <b>cross</b> <b>licensing</b> is that it is ineffective against patent holding companies. The primary business of a patent holding company is to license patents in exchange for a monetary royalty. Thus, they have no need for rights to practice other companies' patents. These companies are often referred to pejoratively as patent trolls.|$|E

50|$|Many {{software}} companies <b>cross</b> <b>license</b> their patents to each other.

50|$|Defensive {{termination}} {{is a form}} of implicit <b>cross</b> <b>licensing</b> of patent {{or other}} intellectual property rights. Consider a case where company A licenses patent A to company B. One of the conditions of the license agreement is that if company B should ever sue company A for infringing one of company B’s own patents, such as patent B, then Company A can terminate the license to patent A. Thus company A would be able to counter sue company B for infringing patent A. This is a strong incentive to prevent company B from suing company A for any future patent it might receive after it has licensed patent A.|$|E
5000|$|In patent law, a {{cross-licensing}} {{agreement is}} an agreement {{according to which}} two or more parties grant a license {{to each other for}} the exploitation of the subject-matter claimed in {{one or more of the}} patents each owns. Usually, this type of agreement happens between two parties in order to avoid litigation or to settle an infringement dispute. Very often, the patents that each party owns covers different essential aspects of a given commercial product. Thus by <b>cross</b> <b>licensing,</b> each party maintains their freedom to bring the commercial product to market. The term [...] "cross licensing" [...] implies that neither party pays monetary royalties to the other party, although this may be the case.|$|E

40|$|A SWOT {{analysis}} of the Indian Pharmaceutical Industry (IPI) in the WTO regime reveals that the much acclaimed IPI’s expertise in process development skills were {{made possible by the}} amendments made to the Indian Patents Act 1970. This strength should be utilized maximum to benefit from opportunities that arise from vertical disintegration of research, clinical trails and manufacturing by the multinationals. The weakness however {{lies in the fact that}} such opportunities will be limited to a few firms in this sector. IPI faces threats in the form of competition from other Asian giants particularly China which has similar expertise in process development and reverse engineering. This paper argues that the IPI should adopt various strategies like producing off patented products, new patented products by acquiring compulsory licensing or <b>cross</b> <b>licensing,</b> collaborate with multinationals not only in R&D and manufacturing but also in marketing new patented products and improving the standards of production to widen the export market.

40|$|Abstract: Whether Intellectual Property rights (“IPRs”) {{can promote}} {{innovation}} {{and social welfare}} is frequently a focal point of debate among businesses, lawyers, economists and governments. It has been observed that businesses often acquire and enforce IPRs, {{while at the same}} time making their innovation available to competitors through standardization, patent pooling, <b>cross</b> <b>license</b> arrangements, open source license and other means. These behaviors of business players suggest that IPRs can promote innovation under certain conditions, or can even be an obstacle to innovation under other conditions. The author proposes designing a simple model that can simulate certain aspects of the innovation process affected by the enforcement of IPRs. The result of the simulation suggests the advantages and disadvantages of IPRs in promoting innovations...|$|R

According to the indictment of American Cyanamid, Bristol Myers, Pfizer, and Cyanamid knew that tetracycline represented a threat to the continuation of their dominant positions and unreasonably high profits.

50|$|The {{fact that}} an {{invention}} is patentable or even patented {{does not necessarily mean}} that use of the invention would not also infringe another patent. The first patent in a given area might include a broad claim covering a general inventive concept if there is at that point no relevant prior art. Later, a specific implementation of that concept might be patentable if it is not disclosed in the earlier patent (or any intervening prior art), but nevertheless still falls within the scope of the earlier claim (covering the general concept). The later inventor must, therefore, obtain a license from the earlier inventor to be able to exploit their invention. At the same time, the earlier inventor might want to obtain a license from the later inventor, particularly if the later invention represents a significant improvement in the implementation of the original broad concept. In this case, the two enter into a <b>cross</b> <b>license.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{several key}} industries, {{including}} semiconductors, biotechnology, computer software, and the Internet, our patent system {{is creating a}} patent thicket: an overlapping set of patent rights requiring that those seeking to commercialize new technology obtain licenses from multiple patentees. The patent thicket is especially thorny when combined with the risk of holdup, namely the danger that new products will inadvertently infringe on patents issued after these products were designed. The need to navigate the patent thicket and holdup is especially pronounced in industries such as telecommunications and comput-ing in which formal standard setting is a core part of bringing new technologies to market. <b>Cross</b> <b>licenses</b> and patent pools are two natural and effective meth-ods used by market participants {{to cut through the}} patent thicket, but each in-volves some transaction costs.

50|$|The {{processors}} for {{the first}} Microvision cartridges were made with both Intel 8021 (<b>cross</b> <b>licensed</b> by Signetics) and Texas Instruments TMS1100 processors. Due to purchasing issues, Milton Bradley switched to using TMS1100 processors exclusively including reprogramming the games that were originally programmed for the 8021 processor. The TMS1100 was a more primitive device, but offered more memory and lower power consumption than the 8021. First-revision Microvisions needed two batteries due to the 8021's higher power consumption, but later units (designed for the TMS1100) only had one active battery holder. Even though the battery compartment was designed to allow the two 9-volt batteries to be inserted with proper polarity {{of positive and negative}} terminals, when a battery was forcefully improperly oriented, while the other battery was properly oriented, the two batteries would be shorted and they would overheat. The solution was to remove terminals for one of the batteries to prevent this hazard. Due to the high cost of changing production molds, Milton Bradley did not eliminate the second battery compartment, but instead removed its terminals and called it the spare battery holder.|$|R
