5|$|A {{group of}} cats is {{referred}} to as a clowder or a glaring, a male <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered), an unaltered female is called a queen, and a juvenile <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> referred to as a kitten. The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed <b>cat,</b> <b>is</b> its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now obsolete word catling.|$|E
5|$|A pedigreed <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> {{one whose}} ancestry is {{recorded}} by a cat fancier organization. A purebred <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> one whose ancestry contains only individuals {{of the same}} breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as show cats. Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry {{are referred to as}} domestic short-haired or domestic long-haired cats, by coat type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly British), or (using terms borrowed from dog breeding) mongrels or mutt-cats.|$|E
5|$|The jungle <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> {{a habitat}} generalist; it inhabits places with {{adequate}} water and dense vegetation, such as swamps, wetlands and riparian areas. Despite its name, the jungle cat shuns rainforests and woodlands. The jungle <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List and is mainly threatened by destruction of wetlands, trapping and poisoning. The {{status of the}} cat in the wild needs further study, though populations {{are thought to be}} declining.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, several sand <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> radio-collared in {{southern}} Israel.In the late 1990s, sand <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> also recorded in Jordan. Sand <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> sighted and camera {{trapped in a}} protected area near Palmyra in Syria in 2000 and 2001.In 2012, sand <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> recorded {{for the first time}} in Iraq's Al Najaf desert.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> meat-eating predators, {{nearly all}} <b>cat</b> games <b>are</b> predatory games.|$|R
50|$|In June 2006 a {{large black}} <b>cat</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded}} in the countryside of Banff, Aberdeenshire. Footage of the <b>cat</b> <b>was</b> broadcast by the BBC on 24 May 2007.|$|R
5|$|The jungle <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> {{a member}} of the genus Felis, which {{consists}} of small cats, within the family Felidae.|$|E

5|$|Several ancient {{religions}} believed {{cats are}} exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence {{decisions made by}} humans. In Japan, the maneki neko <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> a symbol of good fortune.|$|E
50|$|Top <b>Cat</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the early}} {{favorites}} on Cartoon Network. It was aired in India in the 1990s. Top <b>Cat</b> <b>was</b> aired again in 2003 until 2004.|$|R
50|$|Ben's <b>Cat</b> <b>was</b> bred by King T. Leatherbury, who {{was also}} the nearly black gelding's owner and trainer. Ben's <b>Cat</b> <b>was</b> sired by Parker's Storm Cat, whose only win was a five-furlong sprint on the turf. Parker's Storm <b>Cat</b> <b>was</b> well bred however, being by leading sire Storm Cat. Ben's <b>Cat's</b> dam, Twofox, <b>was</b> a stakes-placed mare by Thirty Eight Paces, a stakes winning {{stallion}} also trained by Leatherbury.|$|R
5000|$|In Iran, German, Spanish, {{and other}} {{cultures}} that speak Romance Languages, <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> {{said to have}} 7 lives as opposed to English, where <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> said to have 9 lives.|$|R
5|$|The <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> {{larger in}} its {{northern}} range and in open habitats. A morphological size comparison {{study in the}} eastern United States found a divergence in {{the location of the}} largest male and female specimens, suggesting differing selection constraints for the sexes.|$|E
5|$|The jungle <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> {{listed under}} CITES Appendix II. Hunting is {{prohibited}} in Bangladesh, China, India, Israel, Myanmar, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Thailand and Turkey. But {{it does not}} receive legal protection outside protected areas in Bhutan, Georgia, Laos, Lebanon, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|All {{the cats}} in this genus {{share a common}} {{ancestor}} that {{is believed to have}} lived around 6–7million years ago in the Near East (the Middle East). The exact relationships within the Felidae are close but still uncertain, e.g. the Chinese mountain <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> sometimes classified (under the name Felis silvestris bieti) as a subspecies of the wildcat, like the North African variety F. s. lybica.|$|E
5000|$|The {{infection}} rate in <b>cats</b> <b>is</b> 1-5% {{of that in}} dogs in endemic areas. [...] Both indoor and outdoor <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> infected. The mosquito vector is known to enter homes.|$|R
50|$|Sand <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> {{threatened}} by expanding human settlements, and are killed in traps {{set up by}} herders. Domestic dogs and <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> direct competitors for prey, and may also transmit diseases.|$|R
50|$|Aegean <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> {{noted for}} their {{affinity}} {{for water and}} fishing. Because the breed was allowed to develop through natural selection, rather than selective breeding, Aegean <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> free from most feline genetic diseases.|$|R
5|$|Associated with jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear-air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear caused by jet streams. The <b>CAT</b> <b>is</b> strongest on the cold air side of the jet, next to and just under the axis of the jet. Clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as {{the death of one}} passenger on United Airlines Flight 826.|$|E
5|$|Bears, crocodiles, golden jackals, leopards {{and snakes}} {{are the main}} predators of the jungle cat. The golden jackal, particularly, can be a major {{competitor}} to the cat. When it encounters a threat, the jungle cat will vocalise before engaging in attack, producing sounds like small roars – a behavior uncommon for {{the other members of}} Felis. The meow of the jungle <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> also somewhat lower than that of a typical domestic cat. The jungle cat can host parasites such as Haemaphysalis and Heterophyes species.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of jungle <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> largely oriental; {{it occurs in}} the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, central and southeastern Asia, Sri Lanka and in southern China. It {{is the most common}} small wild cat in India. Thought to be absent from south of the Isthmus of Kra in the Malayan peninsula, the possibility of its occurrence was reported from a highly fragmented forest in the Malaysian state of Selangor in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Populations {{have also}} been {{documented}} along the coast in Thailand. Fishing <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> the least detected cats with only six photos obtained altogether in Kaeng Krachan National Park, Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park and Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area. In March 2003, a single fishing <b>cat</b> <b>was</b> photographed by a camera trap in Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary, northern Cambodia. In 2008, a fishing <b>cat</b> kitten <b>was</b> found in Botum-Sakor National Park, southwest Cambodia. In 2015, fishing <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> also recorded in a coastal wetland in Cambodia.|$|R

5|$|The {{domestic}} <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> {{believed to}} have evolved from the Near Eastern wildcat, whose range covers vast portions of the Middle East westward to the Atlantic coast of Africa. Between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago the animal {{gave rise to the}} genetic lineage that eventually produced all domesticated cats, having diverged from the Near Eastern wildcat around 8,000 BC in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|The feral <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> {{known to}} prey on the red-capped robin, and several bird species {{including}} the Australian raven (Corvus coronoides), grey shrike-thrush (Colluricincla harmonica), grey butcherbird (Cracticus torquatus) and white-browed babbler (Pomatostomus superciliosus) raid nests and take young. There is one {{record of a}} brown-headed honeyeater (Melithreptus brevirostris) feeding on an egg. Predation is the commonest cause of nest failure.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar is a near-threatened {{species and}} its numbers are declining. Threats include loss and {{fragmentation}} of habitat. While {{international trade in}} jaguars or their parts is prohibited, the <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> still frequently killed by humans, particularly in conflicts with ranchers and farmers in South America. Although reduced, its range remains large. Given its historical distribution, the jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of numerous indigenous American cultures, {{including those of the}} Maya and Aztec.|$|E
50|$|As of 2016, <b>Cats</b> <b>is</b> the fourth-longest-running show in Broadway history, and was {{the longest}} running Broadway show in history from 1997 until 2006 when it was surpassed by The Phantom of the Opera. <b>Cats</b> <b>is</b> the sixth-longest-running West End musical. It has been {{performed}} around the world many times and has been translated into more than 20 languages. In 1998, <b>Cats</b> <b>was</b> turned into a made-for-television film.|$|R
40|$|An aged <b>cat</b> <b>was</b> {{presented}} {{with a history of}} chronic relapsing weakness and depression. Profound hypokalaemia was detected in association with increased serum aldosterone levels and marginally subnormal plasma renin activity. A diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) was made and the <b>cat</b> <b>was</b> successfully treated for 2 ½ months with spironolactone. When renal failure developed, the <b>cat</b> <b>was</b> destroyed and at autopsy a large adrenal cortical adenocarcinoma was found...|$|R
50|$|The last {{reported}} {{sighting of}} the Chinese lop-eared <b>cat</b> <b>was</b> in 1938 when a droop-eared <b>cat</b> <b>was</b> imported from China. On that last occasion the mutation {{was believed to}} occur only in white long-haired cats.|$|R
5|$|The {{jungle cat}} (Felis chaus), {{also called the}} reed cat or swamp <b>cat,</b> <b>is</b> a {{medium-sized}} cat native to the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia and southern China. It {{is a member of}} the genus Felis and was first described by Johann Anton Güldenstädt in 1776. Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber gave the jungle cat its present binomial name and is therefore generally considered as binomial authority. Ten subspecies are recognised at present.|$|E
5|$|The jungle <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> {{listed as}} Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Major {{threats to the}} jungle cat include habitat loss such as the {{destruction}} of wetlands, dam construction, environmental pollution, industrialisation and urbanisation. Illegal hunting is a threat in Turkey and Iran. Its rarity in Southeast Asia is possibly due {{to high levels of}} hunting.|$|E
5|$|The serval {{is similar}} to the {{sympatric}} caracal, but has a narrower spoor, a rounder skull, and lacks its prominent ear tufts. The African golden <b>cat</b> <b>is</b> darker, with different cranial features. It resembles the cheetah in its build and coat pattern, though not in size. The serval shares its adaptations to its marshy habitat with the jungle cat; both cats have large and sharp ears that help in locating the prey efficiently, and their long legs raise them above muddy ground and water.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cats</b> <b>are</b> less of {{a threat}} than the other enemies, {{although}} they are impossible to get rid of. All <b>Cats</b> <b>are</b> immune to the player's attacks and come in a shade of brown and pink.|$|R
50|$|Hundreds of {{millions}} of <b>cats</b> <b>are</b> kept as pets around the world. Cats have either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with humans. <b>Cats</b> <b>are</b> also used in the fur trade, as food, and to control pests.|$|R
40|$|An {{epidemiological}} survey of Iriomote cats (Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis) {{was conducted to}} understand the prevalence and molecular characteristics of hemotropic mycoplasma (hemoplasma). A series of ecological surveys of Iriomote <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> performed between November 2003 and September 2010. During this period, 31 Iriomote <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> captured or found, and 39 blood samples were collected. Polymerase chain reaction screening for hemoplasmas and BLAST searches revealed that 4 of the 31 <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> positive for hemoplasma infection (n= 3, Mycoplasma haemofelis [Mhf]; n= 1, ‘Candidatus M. turicensis’ [CMt]). The 4 infected <b>cats</b> <b>were</b> captured or found in the northern area of the island of Iriomote. Phylogenetic analyses revealed close relationships between Mhf and CMt isolated from Iriomote cats compared with those from domestic cats and other wild felids. In our study, we identified two species of hemoplasma in Iriomote cats. The number and location of the hemoplasma-positive <b>cats</b> appeared to <b>be</b> limited; however, continuous surveillance of hemoplasma infection in Iriomote <b>cats</b> <b>is</b> necessary...|$|R
