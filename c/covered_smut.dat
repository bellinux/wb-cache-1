5000|$|In August 1991, the UN {{carried out}} its first {{inspection}} of Iraq’s BW capabilities {{in the aftermath}} of the Gulf War. On 2 August 1991, representatives of the Iraqi government announced to leaders of UNSCOM's [...] "Team 7" [...] that they had conducted research into the offensive use of B. anthracis, botulinum toxins, and Clostridium perfringens toxins. Post-war inspections by UNSCOM, however, were confounded by misinformation and obfuscation. After Iraqi General Hussein Kamel al-Majid defected to Jordan in August 1995, the Iraqi government further disclosed that it had operated a robust BW program at six major sites since the 1980s. It was revealed that the Iraqi program conducted basic research on B. anthracis, rotavirus, camelpox virus, aflatoxin, botulinum toxins, mycotoxins, and an anticrop agent (wheat <b>cover</b> <b>smut).</b> It tested several delivery systems including aerial spray tanks and drone aircraft.

40|$|A three-year {{study on}} the {{practice}} of ratooning of sorghum was conducted in Eastern Kenya (1999 to 2002), with emphasis on the stem borer (Chilo partellus) and <b>covered</b> kernel <b>smut</b> (Sporisorium sorghi Ehrenberg Link). Ratooning is the practice of stimulating tillering by cutting the old straw after harvest (Doggett, 1988). A six season on-station experiment in Machakos District showed the practice of ratooning short duration sorghum increased the reliability and yields in comparison to a direct sown with yield ranges of 1630 - 1778 kg/ha and 0 - 148 kg/ha, respectively. The higher number of heads and stems per unit area meant the ratooned crop had higher level of stem borers per unit area than the direct sown crop and when infected with <b>covered</b> kernel <b>smut</b> was a greater source of inoculum. Unlike the incidence of CKS, the number of stem borers had little correlation with the numbers in the previous season’s crop; there was no upward trend {{to the number of}} stem borers per stem during the experiment suggesting factors other than the presence of a sorghum crop have a stronger influence on the population. Yield loss was an interaction between cultivar*incidence of stem borers * stage of infestation * rain quantity and distribution, but rain was the most important factor. An on-station trial in Kitui (2001 - 2) found the ratooned crop outperformed the direct sown crop in yield by a factor of three and non-cutting of stems produced a similar yield to cutting back stems after harvest. The different ‘ratoon’ methods did not significantly affect the incidence of <b>covered</b> kernel <b>smut</b> or level of stem borers. On-farm trials in Mwingi District (2000 - 2) showed that short duration sorghum ratooned outperformed direct sown sorghum. The timing of the cutting back of the stems had an effect on plant survival and yield; cutting back stems at harvest produced higher yields than cutting the stems at the on-set of rains, however cutting the stems at the onset of rains increased plant survival when the stems were dry at harvest. A decision tree was produced outlining the decisions a farmer needs to make when deciding whether or not to practice ratooning. Four factors were identified as important for varieties to perform well under the practice of ratooning: drought tolerance, stem strength, non-senescence and the ability to produce tillers during growth stage 3...|$|R

The reactions of F 1 progenies of the crosses B 35 - 6 × Sureño and Sureño × BTx 623 suggest incomplete dominance of resistance. There was a very limited amount of F 1 seed from the other resistant × susceptible crosses and therefore no conclusion could be reached on the reactions of their progenies to S. sorghi. A 3 : 1 ratio of resistant to susceptible plants was obtained in the F 2 population of Sureño × BTx 623, suggesting incomplete dominance.

40|$|Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is an {{important}} crop that is usually grown on the Vertisols of north eastern Nigeria during the dry season. The crop is grown on soils with residual moisture, and thus exposing it to terminal drought stress.

At higher plant densities the locally adapted Nigerian variety, Bulwalana produced higher grain yields than the selection from Cameroun, Bourgouri- 28. It also had more efficient water use and better light interception. At low plant densities, Bourgouri- 28 yielded higher than Bulwalana. Leaf area index and radiation interception increased with increasing plant density. Stem borer incidence decreased with increasing plant density.

40|$|A {{study to}} {{identify}} fungal seed borne pathogens on sorghum seed samples {{and to assess}} seed to field transmission of these pathogens was carried out at the Crop Science Department in the 2003 / 04 season. Seed samples collected from Mbare Musika traders and Seed Companies were tested for germination, fungal infection and for Phoma sorghina transmission in the laboratory. The samples were then planted {{in the field in}} a randomized complete block design (RCBD), replicated three times. Disease severity on sorghum plants was assessed at 2 -week intervals from the time disease symptoms appeared in the field for a period of 10 weeks. Mean normal germination was higher for the farm saved samples (13. 15 % and 11 % for white and red farm saved seed respectively) as compared to the certified samples with 11. 5 % and 9. 25 % for white and red certified sample groups respectively. Six pathogenic fungal genera isolated from certified and farm saved samples were Fusarium, Cercospora, Phoma, Bipolaris, Curvularia and Exserohilum. Seed infection with these pathogens ranged from 0 â€“ 38. 1 %, with Fusarium, Cercospora and Phoma having the highest infection percentages of 38. 1 %, 33. 5 % and 34 % respectively. The farm saved samples had generally higher infection levels for most pathogens whilst the certified samples had higher infection levels of Cercospora as compared to the other pathogens. Diseases observed in the field were anthracnose (Colletotrichum graminicola), grey leaf spot (Cercospora sorghi), leaf blight (Phoma sorghina) and <b>covered</b> kernel <b>smut</b> (Sphacelotheca sorghi). There were significant differences in the area under disease progress curves (AUDPC) calculated for the different diseases among the samples (P 0. 05).
