In the mediation between these, <b>corporations</b> <b>law</b> can play a large part, as between market and organisation, or a small part, as between global and local. Even were you not to believe in forces writ large (pace Ireland 2002), <b>corporations</b> <b>law</b> is that environment of business relationships which in part constructs the power people exercise. Collective entrepreneurial activity is defined by <b>corporations</b> <b>law,</b> power being exercised through the acceptance of such risk-taking as both accommodating and constructing the future.

40|$|In {{order to}} effect changes {{to law school}} culture, it is {{critical}} that the central epistemological assumptions of legal education be challenged. Gender analysis is valuable for corporations lawyers because it provides a way to challenge the epistemology which is fundamental to corporate law scholarship. This article proposes to locate the participation of women in <b>corporations</b> <b>law.</b> In doing so, it suggests that the “knowledge” of <b>corporations</b> <b>law</b> which is taught in Australian law schools masks the experiences of women in this area. When one begins to explore the issue of gender and <b>corporations</b> <b>law,</b> one’s immediate impression is that women are invisible. The protagonists in both corporate activity and <b>corporations</b> <b>law</b> always seem to be men. <b>Corporations</b> <b>law</b> is based upon a philosophy of liberal autonomy which has as its basic premise the self-interested male. The law has sought to preserve the liberal philosophy in this area and has regulated behaviour only when individual self-interest has caused certain kinds of quantifiable harms. Implicit and explicit in the <b>law</b> of <b>corporations</b> are such values as competition, hierarchy aggression and strict classification of roles...|$|R

After 1966, he worked for two years as an assistant professor at the Queen's University Faculty of Law and then joined the University of Toronto's law faculty, where he taught until 1974, eventually being promoted to the rank of full professor. Johnston was then appointed as dean of the University of Western Ontario Law School, serving between 1974 and 1979, at which time he was elevated to become the fourteenth Principal and Vice-Chancellor of McGill University.

25|$|Significantly, Delaware {{has one of}} the few {{remaining}} Courts of Chancery in the nation, which has jurisdiction over equity cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many relating to mergers and acquisitions. The Court of Chancery and the Delaware Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning corporate law which generally (but not always) grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers. In addition, the Delaware General <b>Corporation</b> <b>Law,</b> which forms the basis of the Courts' opinions, is widely regarded as giving great flexibility to corporations to manage their affairs. For these reasons, Delaware is considered to have the most business-friendly legal system in the United States; therefore a great number of companies are incorporated in Delaware, including 60% of the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Delaware was the last US state to use judicial corporal punishment, in 1952.|$|E
25|$|As governor, Edge {{obtained}} legislation consolidating state boards, {{improving the}} civil service, imposing a franchise tax on public utilities, allowing greater home rule for cities, reforming <b>corporation</b> <b>law,</b> and improving state institutions, especially the prisons. In 1917 the legislature {{also agreed to}} Edge's proposal to reorganize the state road department, and Edge won approval for legislation authorizing {{the construction of a}} bridge between southern New Jersey and Philadelphia and a tunnel between northern New Jersey and New York City. The bridge had been sought for some time by South Jersey legislators, but had failed to gain the support of North Jersey legislators, who opposed spending state funds on a project that they felt would benefit only {{the southern part of the}} state. Edge therefore combined the bridge proposal with plans for a tunnel to New York to win statewide support. The bridge, the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, which spans the Delaware River between Camden and Philadelphia, opened in 1926, and the tunnel, the Holland Tunnel, which connects Jersey City and lower Manhattan, opened in 1927. It has been contended that the decision to place the terminus of the tunnel in Jersey City was the result of Frank Hague’s support of Edge in the 1916 gubernatorial election.|$|E

Findings: The paper finds that product and capital markets are increasingly placing a premium on good corporate social responsibility and hence, Anglo-American <b>corporations</b> <b>law</b> should be reformed to clarify directors’ capacity to address broader stakeholder concerns.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{sanctions}} and remedies against corporate officers for breaches {{of the provisions}} in the <b>Corporations</b> <b>Law</b> {{is an area of}} the law which has been largely neglected by the legislature. Although there have been several legislative reforms on remedies since the <b>Corporations</b> <b>Law</b> came into force, those reforms were ad hoc in nature and no attempt has been made to carry out a comprehensive review to assess the effectiveness of the existing sanctions and remedies in context of the needs of contemporary society. In consequence, there is increasing concern that the remedies employed in Australia for breaches of the <b>Corporations</b> <b>Law</b> are inadequate, inconsistent, out-dated and are confined within a narrow range. This thesis seeks to evaluate the current package of sanctions and remedies provided under Part 3. 2 of the <b>Corporations</b> <b>Law.</b> As part of this exercise, comparative studies are made with the remedies of other jurisdictions. The provisions for sanctions in Part 3. 2 are measured against parallel provisions in the Crimes Act of the Commonwealth and of New South Wales and Victoria. They are also measured against corresponding provisions in selected foreign jurisdictions. A further comparison is made between the traditional civil remedies under the common law and those in the <b>Corporations</b> <b>Law.</b> The evaluation of the sanctioning regime in Part 3. 2 is made against the criteria appropriateness, adequacy, consistency and accessibility. This thesis discusses the need for a complete re-assessment of the penalty structure to bring the remedies in line with community expectations...|$|R
