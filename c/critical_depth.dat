2500|$|Net {{photosynthesis}} in {{the water}} column is determined by the interaction between the photic zone and the mixed layer. [...] Turbulent mixing by wind energy at the ocean's surface homogenises the water column vertically until the turbulence dissipates (creating the aforementioned mixed layer). [...] The deeper the mixed layer, the lower the average amount of light intercepted by phytoplankton within it. [...] The mixed layer can vary from being shallower than the photic zone, to being much deeper than the photic zone. [...] When it is much deeper than the photic zone, this results in phytoplankton spending too much time in the dark for net growth to occur. [...] The maximum depth of the mixed layer in which net growth can occur is called the <b>critical</b> <b>depth.</b> [...] As long as there are adequate nutrients available, net primary production occurs whenever the mixed layer is shallower than the <b>critical</b> <b>depth.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The brittleness, plasticity, super-plasticity and {{the removal}} {{mechanisms}} of critical {{fragmentation of the}} nano ZrO 2 ceramics were investigated. The formula of <b>critical</b> ductile grinding <b>depth</b> of the common engineering ceramics was inapplicable to the nano-ZrO 2 ceramics. A new formula of <b>critical</b> ductile grinding <b>depth</b> of the nano ceramics was established. The ultrasonic vibration grinding experiments showed that the <b>critical</b> ductile grinding <b>depth</b> of the ceramics was 15 µm by conventional grinding, but the increment of the <b>critical</b> ductile grinding <b>depth</b> was 60 percent by ultrasonic grinding. The <b>critical</b> ductile grinding <b>depth</b> increased to 25 µm. Analyzed by means of SEM, it was transgranular cracking during its cracking process. The nano-ZrO 2 ceramics have high toughness so the <b>critical</b> ductile grinding <b>depth</b> increased.

50|$|Sverdrup’s {{research}} results {{suggested that the}} shoaling of the mixed layer depth to a depth above the <b>critical</b> <b>depth</b> {{was the cause of}} spring blooms. When the mixed layer depth exceeds the <b>critical</b> <b>depth,</b> mixing of the water brings so much of the phytoplankton population below the compensation depth where photosynthesis is impossible that the overall population cannot increase in biomass.

30|$|Some MD {{simulations}} of nanoindentation experiments on single-layer rectangular graphene sheets {{have been carried}} out in order to obtain the mechanical properties of graphene. A correlation between the load and the indentation depth is constructed, and Young’s modulus and the strength of graphene are obtained in the end. The simulation results show that the unloaded graphene film could make a complete recovery if the maximum indentation depth is less than the <b>critical</b> indentation <b>depth,</b> and the graphene film undergoes elastic deformation during the whole loading-unloading-reloading process. However, if the maximum indentation depth is larger than the <b>critical</b> indentation <b>depth,</b> the graphene sheet could not restore its original structures after unloading and the graphene deforms plastically. Based on the {{simulations of}} nanoindentation at different loading speeds and indenter radii, it can be observed that the maximum load increased and the <b>critical</b> indentation <b>depth</b> decreased with the increase of loading speed. In addition, the indenter radius has a remarkable influence on the force-displacement curve. As the indenter radius increases, the critical load and the <b>critical</b> indentation <b>depth</b> also increase.|$|R

A brittle-ductile {{transition}} lapping {{mechanism is}} {{proposed for the}} mechanical lapping of ultra-precision diamond cutting tools, and then the <b>critical</b> <b>depths</b> of cut for brittle-ductile transition in different orientations and on different planes are deduced in theory.

And lapping compression force has an optimal value. Lapping rate should be considered when lapping velocity is selected. But the smaller the lapping velocity is, the littler the cutting edge radius sharpened. Finally, the optimal selections are performed for each influencing factor and a perfect diamond tool is lapped in ductile mode with a cutting edge radius of 30 ~ 40 nm and a surface roughness Ra of 0. 7 nm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Dynamic {{stability}} of machine tool spindle during operations {{is dependent on}} many parameters including the spindle speed, bearing preload, and thermal effect. In this article, a finite element-based model of spindle is presented, which uses the Timoshenko beam theory to obtain the frequency response of the spindle at the tool tip. The effects of the bearing preload and temperature rising on the stability characteristics of themilling systemare therefore investigated. It {{was found that the}} temperature rising has the same effects on the <b>critical</b> cutting <b>depth</b> as on thefirst natural frequencyof themilling system. This result verifies the fact that the <b>critical</b> cutting <b>depth</b> has close relationship with the first nature frequency of the milling system. On conditions that the temperature rising varies with the spindle rotational speed, the increment of the lowest <b>critical</b> cutting <b>depth</b> shifts with the spindle rotational speed.

These formulas enable identifying the asymptotic speed, absolute stability limit, and in-process radial ploughing constant from experimental stability limits without requiring modal parameters. The presented model is validated by comparison with prior works and verified by experiments...|$|R
