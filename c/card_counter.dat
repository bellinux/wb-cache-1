2500|$|A card {{counting}} system assigns a point {{score to}} each rank of card (e.g., 1 point for 2–6, 0 points for 7–9 and −1 point for 10–A). When a card is exposed, a counter adds the score of that card to a running total, the 'count'. A <b>card</b> <b>counter</b> uses this count to make betting and playing decisions {{according to a}} table which they have learned. The count starts at 0 for a freshly shuffled deck for [...] "balanced" [...] counting systems. Unbalanced counts are often started at a value which depends {{on the number of}} decks used in the game.|$|E
2500|$|Alan Schlesinger (R): On May 20, 2006, Connecticut Republicans {{nominated}} former Derby Mayor Alan Schlesinger. In July, it {{was revealed}} that he was involved in inappropriate gambling activities: Schlesinger gambled under the alias [...] "Alan Gold" [...] to avoid detection as a <b>card</b> <b>counter.</b> On July 21, the Hartford Courant reported that Schlesinger had been sued by two New Jersey casinos for gambling debts. Schlesinger quickly faced fire from state party officials and some, including Connecticut Governor Jodi Rell, called on him to withdraw. Connecticut GOP chairman George Gallo had considered previous Republican Senate candidate Jack Orchulli as a possible replacement if Schlesinger had withdrawn. On July 24, however, Courant colummist Kevin Rennie suggested former State Senator Bill Aniskovich of Branford [...] who was defeated in 2004 while seeking his eighth term [...] would replace Schlesinger if he withdrew. Other possible replacements included U.S. Attorney Kevin O'Connor, State Senator John McKinney of Fairfield and Derby state representative Themis Klarides.|$|E

5000|$|Contrary to {{the popular}} myth, <b>card</b> <b>counters</b> do not need unusual mental {{abilities}} to count cards, {{because they are not}} tracking and memorizing specific <b>cards.</b> Instead, <b>card</b> <b>counters</b> assign a point score to each card they see that estimates the value of that card, and then they track the sum of these values - a process called keeping a [...] "running count." [...] The myth that counters keep track of every card was portrayed in the 1988 film Rain Man, in which the savant character Raymond Babbitt counts through six decks with ease and a casino employee erroneously comments {{that it is impossible to}} count six decks.|$|R

50|$|Play accuracy. Normal players {{tend to make}} basic {{strategy}} errors. <b>Card</b> <b>counters</b> must accurately {{know exactly}} when to hit, stand, split, or double down. Software can verify {{the rate at which}} the player makes errors and calculate the resulting house edge.|$|R
50|$|Because MindPlay {{tends to}} thwart {{their efforts to}} beat a {{blackjack}} game, <b>card</b> <b>counters</b> generally avoid casinos which use the system and its competitors, and often circulate news of such installations on various Internet sites. Some <b>card</b> <b>counters</b> have {{tried to make the}} general public aware of the use of these systems, in an effort to convince others not to patronize the games. Indeed, MindPlay has been somewhat slow to spread among American casinos, partly because of the cost (which must be weighed against that of card-counters) and partly because of negative reaction by players. On the other hand, there were many problems with the systems and some players were able to exploit them.|$|R

50|$|The {{strategy}} {{applied to}} the playing of hands {{can be used to}} detect a possible counter since very few players employ perfect playing strategy.

5000|$|Atlantic City {{casinos in}} the US state of New Jersey are {{forbidden}} from barring <b>card</b> <b>counters</b> {{as a result}} of a New Jersey Supreme Court decision. In 1979 Ken Uston, a Blackjack Hall of Fame inductee, filed a lawsuit against an Atlantic City casino, claiming that casinos did not have the right to ban skilled players. The New Jersey Supreme Court agreed, ruling that [...] "the state's control of Atlantic City's casinos is so complete that only the New Jersey Casino Control Commission has the power to make rules to exclude skillful players." [...] The Commission has made no regulation on card counting, so that Atlantic City casinos are not allowed to ban <b>card</b> <b>counters.</b> Being unable to ban counters even if detected, Atlantic City casinos increased countermeasures.|$|R

50|$|Bet variation. The {{simplest}} way a <b>card</b> <b>counter</b> makes money is to bet more {{when he has}} an edge. While playing back the tapes of a recent session of play, software can generate a scatter plot of the amount bet versus the count {{at the time the}} bet was made and find the trendline that best fits the scattered points. If the player is not counting cards, there will be no trend; his bet variation and the count variation will not consistently correlate. If the player is counting and varying bets according to the count, there will be a trend whose slope reflects the player's average edge from this technique.|$|E
5000|$|According to a 1942 Insider Hollywood article, the Moscow mule {{was most}} popular in Los Angeles, where it originated. The Nevada State Journal (12 October 1943) {{reinforced}} the mule's popularity in reporting: [...] "Already the mule is climbing {{up into the}} exclusive handful of most-popular mixed drinks". It became known as a favorite drink of Reno casino owner William F. Harrah. In his book Beat the Dealer (1964), Edward O. Thorp did not name the Tahoe casino where {{he thought he had}} been poorly treated as a <b>card</b> <b>counter.</b> Instead, he wrote, [...] "Immediately I had a Moscow mule", subtly hinting that the location was Harrah's Tahoe, due to Harrah's then well-known proclivity for the drink.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, as {{computing}} power grew, more advanced (and more difficult) card-counting systems came into favor.

25|$|In the 1920s to 1930s, various <b>card</b> <b>counters</b> were {{produced}} in the UK, including the Little Dorrit counter, and the schoolgirl counter. From around 2006 Maik Remmers designed and manufactured in Germany a series of 3D <b>card</b> <b>counters</b> {{in the shape of}} skeins of wool, animals and abstract designs. These are folded and printed on back and front, with a pair of rotatable number discs sandwiched between the layers of card. The discs can be rotated to reveal numerals through two windows in the front layer of card. The outer surface of the card can be written-on with water-soluble ink, and the back surface of the counter contains a form where the knitter can fill in current row numbers. This is necessary as there is not enough friction to prevent the number discs from moving during storage.|$|R
