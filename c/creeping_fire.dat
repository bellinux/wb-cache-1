The fire-resistant performance of LVL butt joints connected with metal plates protected with graphite phenolic sphere (GPS) sheeting was discussed. The GPS sheeting was overlaid on the joint in different sizes and locations. The joint was exposed to a burner with a top flame temperature of 800 °C and loaded with a load of 200 N to test for <b>creep</b> under <b>fire.</b> The {{results showed that the}} fire-resistant performance of the joint was markedly improved by the sheeting. The size and location of the GPS sheet significantly affected the time to rupture of the specimen, which was six times longer than that without GPS. Temperature measurements at the joint showed that the GPS sheeting distributed the heat along the surface and delayed failure. Thermographic images and analyses clarified the improvement in fire-resistant properties due to GPS.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study changes in {{anatomical}} structure of phloem tissue in pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stems influenced by creeping forest fires of various rates. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} Lower Angara river region of the Angara provenance, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Central Siberia. The trees with green crowns and different fire damaged butts were chosen as models. Control (undamaged) trees were taken from stands adjacent to experimental plots. The changes of inner bark thickness, number of phloem annual layers between cambium and periderm and number of cells in conductive phloem were found in the stem side opposite to fire scars. The structure fluctuations of phloem tissue were detected: disturbances of sieve cell arrangement, phloem ray enlargements, resin canal overgrowth and formation of great resin ducts. The lignin accumulation was observed in inner bark and a large amount of callusing was detected between conductive and nonconductive phloem. Over the course of time, repairing of tissues occurred and the normal inner bark structure and chemistry (without lignin) were restored. The <b>creeping</b> <b>fire</b> of low intensity caused the maximal changes of phloem quantitative characteristics in trees with bark charring and these tendencies were stored after eight years. After <b>creeping</b> <b>fire</b> of high intensity the tendency for phloem thickening in trees with one fire scar and to thinning in strongly damaged trees were revealed. Also tendencies to decrease of the number of phloem annual layers, number of sieve cells in conductive phloem and ray frequency with increasing of stem injury degree were observed, besides axial parenchyma percentage trended to increase. Eight years after fire these tendencies were often not visible...|$|E
40|$|Vigor {{state of}} middle-aged pine stands was {{estimated}} during 2002 - 2008 at {{permanent sample plots}} by two methods: 1) visual estimation of stand vigor rank according to the 6 -point scale of Forest Regulations of RF and 2) method of induction of tree defense response (injection of stem with high molecular extractives from Ceratocystis laricicola mycelium and registration of parameters of stem phloem necrosis). The stands of similar origin and structure were preliminarily divided into background and polluted ones {{on the basis of}} different amount of polluting substances in snow cover. Estimation of external tree signs according to 6 -point scale didn't reveal significant differences between stands in monitored period. In contrast to this morphological method parameters of specific necrotic response of stem inner bark to fungal extract differed significantly in background and polluted stands. Parameters of the necrotic spots on the phloem were shown to depend on effect of <b>creeping</b> <b>fire.</b> The necrosis size increased and the necrosis "moved" toward crown during two years after the fire. The results are in accordance with the hypothesis that the size of phloem necrosis induced by the effect of extractives from phytopathogenic fungus mycelium on stem vascular tissues was determined by the tree state - it increased in damaged tree and decreased with tree state improvement. The injection method can inform about changes of physiological condition of tree and stand at the latent stage when exterior characteristics of a tree haven't changed yet...|$|E
40|$|In 2002 – 2013, on {{permanent}} {{sample plots}} (PPs), the condition of suburban middle-aged pine stands of Krasnoyarsk was investigated. Annual assessments of parameters of defense response of stem phloem of the sample trees on the action of extractives from mycelium Ceratocystis laricicola (Redfern & Minter) were carried out. The size of a phloem necrosis and its shift along a stem relative to inoculation hole were measured. The pine stands (polluted and conditionally background) are convenient for determining condition changes at early stages of damage. These stands are affected by different anthropogenic factors, but don't differ in vigor state as visually estimated on a 6 -point scale of Forest Regulation of Russian Federation. PPs have similar forest inventory characteristics, except for PPs on an edge of polluted pine forest where the site class is reduced. Significant shift of necrosis in phloem up on a stem within two years following a year {{when there was a}} spring <b>creeping</b> <b>fire</b> is registered. It proves the reversal of normal basipetal transport of assimilates toward crown and feasibility of using necrosis asymmetry for assessment of fire influence on physiological condition of pine stands.

In a <b>creeping</b> barrage, <b>fire</b> moved from one line to the next. In a block barrage, the 'block' moved as block to the next lines that were not previously engaged.

40|$|The {{effects of}} thermal creep of {{prestressing}} steel on post-tensioned concrete slabs in and after fire were investigated based on existing thermal creep model and calibrated parameters in this paper. A nonlinear {{finite element model}} was built up employing ABAQUS package, taking into account frictionless contact behaviour between prestressing steel tendons and surrounding concrete. The nonlinear material behaviour of concrete and prestressing steel at elevated temperatures was taken into account, where three material models for prestressing steel were adopted with or without considering thermal creep, {{and based on the}} model from EN 1992 - 1 - 2. The finite element model developed was verified against experimental results from the literature, showing that the model considering thermal creep was more accurate.

40|$|Fire {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors involved in the establishment and development of many lodgepole pine forests in North America. In the Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine is usually considered a fire-maintained seral type. But even here fires vary greatly in frequency, intensity, size, and other characteristics. A particular fire regime greatly affects forest succession, longevity of the species, stocking, and species composition; and fire also influences the incidence of insects and diseases. Fuel quantity changes over time and with it fire behavior potentials in natural and slash fuels. Fire behavior potentials are greatest when buildup of dead fuel coincides with development of understory conifers. Most fires are low intensity, <b>creeping,</b> surface <b>fires,</b> but high intensity crown fires during severe weather burn the most acreage. Fires, stand development, mortality influences, and fuel accumulation interact in a complex network.

40|$|In 2007 – 2014 on the {{permanent}} sample plot (PSP) in Krasnoyarsk suburban young pine forest (forest-steppe zone of Central Siberia), annual inventory characteristics were estimated. PSP area was 0. 024 ha. In 2007 {{the average age of}} pine young forest was 7 years; 413 trees with height more than 1. 3 m, including 412 living trees and 1 dead tree were measured. Since 2007 the parameters of each tree were measured every year. The diameter at the height of 1. 3 m (D 1, 3), the tree height (H), the category of vital state (by a 6 -grade scale of the Forest Health Regulation of the Russian Federation) were determined. The stem volume (V) of each tree was estimated using regression equation including the variables: V, D 1, 3, H. Parameters of the equation were calculated by sample trees, measured in 2007 and 2014. The timber stock was determined as the sum of stem volumes of the separate trees. At early stage of pine tree stand formation, the form factor (f) in young pine growth exceeded 1. During 2007 – 2014 average diameter increased from 1. 8 to 5. 3 cm, average height – from 2. 3 to 6. 2 m, timber stock of the growing trees – from 16 to 128 m 3 /ha, dead timber stock of the dead trees – from 0 to 1 m 3 /ha. In 2007 density of more than 17 thousand trees per ha was registered. The maximum density of more than 18 thousand trees per ha was registered in 2009. In the next years, this indicator monotonically decreased. In 2014 density was less than 15 thousand trees per ha. The increase in density is due to {{increase in the number of}} trees, with height more than 1. 3 m, the decrease – by phytocoenotic stress and felling. In 2007 the category of the tree stand vital state was near 1. In 2014 the category was 1. 3.
