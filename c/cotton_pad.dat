40|$|The complex {{nature of}} skin {{contributes}} to the microbial population present on its surface. While normal skin flora is either beneficial or {{has no effect on}} the body, there are instances where pathogenic microorganisms are present and can cause infections. Damaged skin is more susceptible to infections from these microbes. Behavioral characteristics, {{such as the use of}} cosmetics, can affect the microbial population present on the skin. Staphylococcus aureus is the organism most commonly isolated from cosmetics, and it can be responsible for conjunctivitis, impetigo, boils, and folliculitis. There are many ways microbial contamination of cosmetics can occur, such as ineffective preservatives and consumer habits. With the advent of commercially-available cosmetic cleaning products, consumers may have a plausible means of reducing contamination on their cosmetics and cosmetic brushes. The objectives of this study were to determine the effectiveness of commercially-available cosmetic cleaners in reducing microbial contamination on cosmetics and cosmetic brushes. Cosmetics (i. e., eyeshadow/blush and lipstick) and large and small cosmetic brushes were inoculated with a known concentration of S. aureus, allowed a 0 -, 1 -, or 5 -minute contact time, and treated with commercially-available cleaning products. Isopropyl alcohol and a <b>cotton</b> <b>pad</b> were compared to commercially-available sprays, wipes, and shampoos. Unused cosmetics and brushes were inoculated with the target organism, and culture analysis was used to determine the reduction of microbial concentration on cosmetics and cosmetic brushes after cleaning. On eyeshadows, the <b>cotton</b> <b>pad</b> exhibited a significantly greater reduction in microbial contamination compared to spray # 2; 99. 44 % and 37. 86 %, respectively. For the lipsticks, both wipe # 2 (99. 77 % reduction) and 70 % isopropanol wipe (99. 56 %) had a significantly greater reduction in microbial concentration compared to the <b>cotton</b> <b>pad</b> (96. 18 %). For contact times, there were no statistically significant results. In addition, there were no statistically significant results for products used on the small brushes. On the large brushes, the wipes (98. 01 %) exhibited a greater percent reduction of microbial contamination compared to shampoos (89. 92 %). The results of this study demonstrate that cleaning products, regardless of contact time with the microorganisms, cleaning product type, or cleaning product brand, were effective in reducing microbial contamination on cosmetics and cosmetic brushes. These results may provide valuable information to consumers about the importance of regular maintenance of their cosmetics and cosmetic brushes...|$|E

Methods: Symblepharon models were made in beagle eyes. A <b>cotton</b> <b>pad</b> soaked in 1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) {{was placed in the}} conjunctival sac of each eye for 90 seconds, followed by washing the sac with 100 ml of physiological saline. Immediately post treatment, one eye drop (50 μl) including 1 mM-CI or the vehicle (CI-treated group and vehicle-treated group, respectively) was instilled in 5 eyes of 5 beagles once daily for 5 weeks. Fellow eyes were left untreated and served as the normal group. The severity of symblepharon was graded by macroscopic observation. After the eyes were enucleated, conjunctival and scleral tissue specimens were histologically evaluated. Results: Macroscopic observation revealed that symblepharon was induced in all NaOH-treated eyes, while symblepharon scores were significantly lower in the CI group than in the vehicle-treated group. Histological observation indicated a significant reduction in the adhered area in the CI-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated group. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that vimentin-, α-smooth muscle actin-, chymase-, and angiotensin II-positive cells as well as mast cells increased in the vehicle-treated group compared to the normal group, whereas they were reduced in the CI-treated group. Conclusions: Our macroscopic and histological findings indicated that a multiple application of CI eye drops suppressed conjunctival scarring in a canine symblepharon model, suggesting that the topical application of CI may be a promising therapy for symblepharon...|$|E
40|$|Olfaction {{appears to}} play {{a pivotal role in}} {{immediate}} postnatal interactions between mammalian mothers and their offspring. The present study examined: (1) whether and how the newborn human infant and its mother communicate by means of olfaction; (2) the role of amniotic fluid (AF) and breast odors in such communication; (3) olfactory learning by neonates. An undisturbed communication may {{play an important role in}} the initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding. The newborns of studies I-V were uninfluenced by pharmacological pain relief given to the mother. Newborn babies seek and locate the mother's breast within the first hour after birth and prefer an unwashed breast to the washed alternative, indicating that olfaction is implicated in breast seeking behavior (I). Other senses (e. g. vision, touch, temperature sensitivity) may also help the baby to locate the nipple. To determine more precisely the role of olfaction, a <b>cotton</b> <b>pad</b> bearing the mother's breast odor was placed 17 cm. in front of the baby who was laying prone on a warm bed. The breast odor elicited crawling movements towards the <b>cotton</b> <b>pad</b> and stereotyped prefeeding behaviors that are typically observed when babies are placed on their mother's chest. These findings indicate that smell, in the absence of other maternal cues, helps guide the baby to the nipple and evokes the behavioral preludes of breastfeeding (V). Amniotic fluid odor is attractive for mammalian neonates. The current study has shown that newborns prefer to suck from a breast treated with AF rather than a naturally smelling breast during the first postnatal hour, possibly reflecting prenatal learning (II). Within several days after birth, the AF preference was replaced by a preference for the natural breast odor, suggesting postnatal olfactory learning (III). Movement of the hand to the mouth and finger sucking are components of the prefeeding behavior displayed immediately after birth. This behavior is disturbed when AF was washed off the baby before it was given to the mother (II). Washing may therefore disrupt prefeeding behavior and proper attachment to the nipple, and related studies have shown that problems with nipple attachment are associated with early breastfeeding failure. Odors can influence behavior during stress. Newborns who were separated from their mother during the first postnatal hours were exposed to either AF odor or maternal breast odor presented on cotton pads. AF soothed newborns, whereas breast odor elicited increased crying relative to control trials (IV). The calming effect of AF might reflect prenatal exposure to that scent. Maternal breast odor may have signalled the presence of food, and the babies became frustrated /agitated when they could not reach the source. Immediate postnatal olfactory learning is shown in several mammals. The capability for early postnatal olfactory learning was studied in Caesarean section delivered babies, who during the first postnatal hour - were exposed for 30 min to an artificial odor (cherry or passion fruit) (VI). Caesarean section delivered babies demonstrated such olfactory learning at testing about three days later, but only if the mothers had experienced uterine contractions before the operation. The norepinephrine levels in the umbilical artery correlated positively to learning. This learning may depend upon locus coeruleus activation and/or the catecholamine surge, and is further evidence that uterine contractions contribute to neonatal adaptation. In summary, the newborn and its mother communicate by means of olfaction. Several common hospital care routines such as washing the baby immediately after birth and the mother's breasts before feeding interfere with this communication and should be avoided until we know more about its clinical significance...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Excessive {{aggregation}} of platelets at {{the site}} of plaque rupture on the coronary artery {{led to the formation of}} thrombus which is reported to precipitate acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Nitric oxide (NO) has been reported to inhibit platelet aggregation and induce thrombolysis through the in situ formation of plasmin. As the plasma NO level in AMI patients from two different ethnic groups was reduced to 0 µM (median) compared to 4. 0 µM (median) in normal controls, the effect of restoration of the NO level to normal ranges on the rate of death due to AMI was determined. METHODS AND RESULTS: The restoration of plasma NO level was achieved by a sticking small <b>cotton</b> <b>pad</b> (10 × 25 mm) containing 0. 28 mmol sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in 0. 9 % NaCl to the abdominal skin of the participants using non-toxic adhesive tape which was reported to normalize the plasma NO level. The participants (8, 283) were volunteers in an independent study who had different kinds of cancers and did not wish to use any conventional therapy for their condition but opted to receive SNP "pad" for their condition for 3 years. The use of SNP "pad" which normalized (≈ 4. 0 µM) the plasma NO level that in consequence reduced the death rate due to AMI, among the participants, was found to be significantly reduced compared to the death due to AMI in normal population. CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that the use of SNP "pad" significantly reduced the death due to AMI. TRIAL REGISTRATION: www. ctri. nic. in CTRI/ 2013 / 12 / 004236...|$|E
