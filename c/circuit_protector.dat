40|$|The paper {{describes}} the properties and potential applications {{of a novel}} hybrid varistor device originating from biased voltage induced modified nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. Single crystal of an oxide semiconductor in the family of iron-titanates with the chemical formula of Fe 2 TiO 5 (pseudobrookite) {{has been used as}} substrate for the varistor. The modifications of the varistor characteristics are achieved by superimposition of a bias voltage in the current path of the varistor. These altered I-V characteristics, when analyzed, reveal the existence of embedded transistors coexisting with the varistor. These transistors exhibit mutual conductance, signal amplification and electronic switching which are the defining signatures of a typical transistor. The tuned varistors also acquire the properties of signal amplification and mutual conductance which expand the range of applications for a varistor beyond its traditional use as <b>circuit</b> <b>protector.</b> Both tuned varistors and the embedded transistors have attributes which make them suitable for many applications in electronics including at high temperatures and for radiation dominated environments such as space...|$|E

50|$|A {{short circuit}} is an {{abnormal}} connection between two nodes {{of an electric}} circuit intended to be at different voltages. This results in an electric current limited only by the Thévenin equivalent resistance {{of the rest of}} the network which can cause circuit damage, overheating, fire or explosion. Although usually the result of a fault, there are cases where short circuits are caused intentionally, for example, for the purpose of voltage-sensing crowbar <b>circuit</b> <b>protectors.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the Independent Orbiter Assessment (IOA) of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Critical Items List (CIL) are presented. The IOA {{approach}} features a top-down analysis of the hardware to determine failure modes, criticality, and potential critical items. To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation. This report documents the analysis results corresponding to the Orbiter Backup Flight System (BFS) hardware. The BFS hardware consists of one General Purpose Computer (GPC) loaded with backup flight software and the components used to engage/disengage that unique GPC. Specifically, the BFS hardware includes the following: DDU (Display Driver Unit), BFC (Backup Flight Controller), GPC (General Purpose Computer), switches (engage, disengage, GPC, CRT), and <b>circuit</b> <b>protectors</b> (fuses, <b>circuit</b> breakers). The IOA analysis process utilized available BFS hardware drawings and schematics for defining hardware assemblies, components, and hardware items. Each level of hardware was evaluated and analyzed for possible failure modes and effects. Criticality was assigned based upon {{the severity of the}} effect for each failure mode. Of the failure modes analyzed, 19 could potentially result in a loss of life and/or loss of vehicle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{new type}} {{residual}} current protector is designed in this paper. Using residual magnetic flux and the resonance voltage as leakage current signal in iron core, {{when there are}} residual current in power suply system, the device can automatically take relevant actions according to the real-time residual current value that is detected by detection <b>circuit.</b> The <b>protector</b> {{can be used to}} against electric shock and protect a ground fault. When the protection is occurred, the residual current protective device (RCD) possesses the inverse time lag function, ideal time delay and the automatic reclosing function. It also transmits the fault information to control center by the inter-integrated circuit (I 2 C) bus. Resonant circuit can avoid live parts injury, which limit the current value through contact resistance, and does not interrupt the work of electrical equipment. So the RCD can be used in all kinds of low voltage single-phase system that will snsure the safety and the reliability of the power supply...|$|R

50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic <b>protectors.</b> Fuses and <b>circuit</b> breakers are overcurrent or short <b>circuit</b> <b>protectors.</b> Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} {{customers}} fed by a single distribution transformer varies depending on the {{number of customers}} in an area. Several homes may be fed off a single transformer in urban areas; rural distribution may require one transformer per customer. A large commercial or industrial complex will have multiple distribution transformers. Padmount transformers are used in urban areas and neighborhoods where the primary distribution lines run underground. Many large buildings have electric service provided at primary distribution voltage. These buildings have customer-owned transformers in the basement for step-down purposes. In a secondary network system as used in urban areas, many distribution transformers may be connected in parallel, each equipped with its own network <b>protector</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker to isolate it from the secondary network in case of a fault.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tends to}} develop for {{protection}} for costly appliances which require three-phase AC supply for operation. Failure {{of any of}} the phases or sudden change in voltage makes the appliance prone to erratic functioning and may even lead to failure. Hence it is of paramount importance to monitor the availability of the three-phase supply and proper voltage supply and switch off the appliance in the event of failure of one or two phases or if required voltage level is not available. The power to the appliance should resume with the availability of all phases of the supply with proper voltage level. The main advantage of this <b>protector</b> <b>circuit</b> is that it protects three-phase appliances from failure of any phase as well as from fluctuation of voltage. The concept in future can be extended to developing a mechanism to send message to the authority via SMS by interfacing GSM modem. Details description of all types of faults is given below...|$|R
