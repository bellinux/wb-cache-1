5000|$|A {{version of}} the {{concentric}} cylinder packed particles or close-packed polymer to create a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) carbon anode. This system is fabricated by using colloidal crystal templating, electrochemical thin-film growth, and soft sol-gel chemistry. 3DOM materials have a unique structure of nanometer thick walls that surround interconnected and <b>closed-packed</b> sub-micrometer voids. The 3DOM structure is coated with a thin polymer layer and then filled with second conducting phase. This method leads to a battery with short transport lengths, high ionic conductivity and reasonable electrical conductivity. It removes the need for additives that do not contribute to electrochemical performance. Performance can be improved by coating with tin oxide nanoparticles to enhance the initial capacity. [...] The coating infiltrates the network formed by the 3DOM structure to produce uniform thickness.|$|E

It is demonstrated that the predicted habit plane and orientation relationship are coincident well with the observed crystallographic features. The polymorphic phase transformation of C-centred monoclinic structure to body-centred tetragonal structure is proposed to start from an initial Bain lattice correspondence that close-packed plane of matrix is parallel to close-packed plane of product, so is <b>closed-packed</b> direction.

40|$|The crystal {{structures}} of some light actinide metals are studied theoretically {{as a function}} of applied pressure. The first principles electronic structure theory is formulated in the framework of density functional theory, with the gradient corrected local density approximation of the exchange-correlation functional. The light actinide metals are shown to be well described as itinerant (metallic) f-electron metals and generally, they display a crystal structure which have, in agreement with previous theoretical suggestions, increasing degree of symmetry and closed-packing upon compression. The theoretical calculations agree well with available experimental data. At very high compression, the theory predicts <b>closed-packed</b> structures such as the fcc or the hcp structures or the nearly <b>closed-packed</b> bcc structure for the light actinide metals. A simple canonical band picture is presented to explain in which particular <b>closed-packed</b> form these metals will crystallize at ultra-high pressure...|$|E

The combination of nanoindentation with high-resolution atomic force microscopy provides us with experimental atomic-scale information {{on the process of}} dislocation nucleation and multiplication. Our results reveal a unique deformation behavior of bcc Ta at the onset of plasticity which is distinctly different from that of <b>closed-packed</b> metals. Most noticeable, we observe only one rather than a sequence of discontinuities in the load-displacement curves. This and other differences are discussed in context of the characteristic plastic deformation behavior of bcc metals...|$|E

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} topological insulator crystals {{consist of}} an insulating bulk enclosed by metallic surfaces, and detailed theoretical {{predictions about the}} surface state band topology and spin texture are available. While several topological insulator materials are currently known, the existence and topology of these metallic states have only ever been probed for one particular surface orientation of a given material. For most topological insulators, such as Bi$_{ 1 -x}$Sb$_{x}$ and Bi$_ 2 $Se$_ 3 $, this surface is the <b>closed-packed</b> (111) surface and it supports one topologically guaranteed surface state Dirac cone. Here we experimentally realise a non <b>closed-packed</b> surface of a topological insulator, Bi$_{ 1 -x}$Sb$_{x}$(110), and probe the surface state topology by angle-resolved photoemission. As expected, this surface also supports metallic states but the change in surface orientation drastically modifies the band topology, leading to three Dirac cones instead of one, in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions but in contrast to any other experimentally studied TI surface. This illustrates the possibility to tailor the basic topological properties of the surface via its crystallographic direction. Here it introduces a valley degree of freedom not previously achieved for topological insulator systems...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{fabrication}} of ordered hexagonal arrays of air-spaced GaN nanopillars by nanosphere lithography. A self-assembled two-dimensional silica nanosphere mask was initially formed by spin-coating. Prior to pattern transfer to the GaN substrate, a silica-selective dry etch recipe was employed to reduce {{the dimensions of the}} nanospheres, without shifting their equilibrium positions. This process step was crucial to be formation of air-spaced hexagonal arrays of nanospheres, as opposed to <b>closed-packed</b> arrays normally achieved by nanosphere lithography. This pattern is then transferred to the wafer to form air-spaced nanopillars. By introducing air gaps between pillars, a photonic band gap (PBG) in the visible region can be opened up, which is usually nonexistent in <b>closed-packed</b> nanopillar arrays. The PBG structures were designed using the plane wave expansion algorithm for band structure computations. The existence and positions of band gaps have been verified through optical transmittance spectroscopy, which correlated well with predictions from simulations. From photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, a fourfold increase in PL intensity was observed and compared to an as-grown sample, demonstrating the effectiveness of well-designed self-assembled PBG structures for suppressing undesired optical guiding mode via PBG and for promoting light extraction. The effects of defects in the nanopillar array on the optical properties are also critically assessed. © 2011 American Institute of Physics. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

The (1 1 2) peak intensity shows more crystalline CIS at the wavelength of photo-assistance at about 380 to 476  nm. This is presumably because of an enhanced surface migration of reduced atoms by intensity of photo-assistance.
