5|$|As of October 2011, {{consumption}} of liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel has cut between 4 and 19%, {{despite the fact}} that more than 1 million <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> been added to Iran's fleet. Increased use of compressed natural gas (CNG) to fuel cars has also reportedly played a role in this. According to the government, if oil products consumption had not been managed, {{consumption of}} gasoline would have increased to 120 million liters per day, while by reforming consumption pattern the figure has fallen to 60 million liters per day. In November 2011, the Government reported that the subsidy reform plan has saved Iran $6 billion.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{availability}} {{is limited}} {{and the initial}} roll-out markets include California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington, followed by the Northeastern states. Nationwide availability is expected by mid 2012. The first delivery to a fleet customer took place on December 8, 2011 in San Francisco. The first delivery went to City CarShare, a non-profit carsharing service that operates in San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley. The first individual customer delivery took place on Honolulu, Hawaii, on December 12, 2011. Sales increased from 80 units in 2011 to 588 in 2012, and rose to 1,029 during 2013.

5|$|Plug-in <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> several {{benefits}} {{compared to}} conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. They have lower operating and maintenance costs, and produce little or no local air pollution. They reduce dependence on petroleum and may reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the onboard source of power, depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation to charge the batteries. Plug-in hybrids capture most of these benefits when they are operating in all-electric mode. Despite their potential benefits, market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles has been slower than expected as adoption faces several hurdles and limitations. The global market share of the light-duty plug-in vehicle segment achieved 0.86% of total new car sales in 2016, up from 0.62% in 2015 and 0.38% in 2014. However, the stock of plug-in electric cars represented just 0.15% of the 1.4 billion motor vehicles on the world's roads {{by the end of}} 2016.|$|E

5|$|The {{discontinuance}} of the Atlantic City Express in 1995, and {{the arrival}} of the California Cars in 1996 and the Surfliner railcars in 2000–2002, lessened the need for the Metroliner-based cab cars. However, the Vermonter corridor service began using them when a reverse move was added between Springfield, Massachusetts and Palmer, Massachusetts in 1995. The later cab cars, and some of the earlier conversions, were retired in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2007, six of the 9600-series cab cars were brought out of retirement to support additional frequencies on the newly re-electrified Keystone Service. After the Vermonters backup move was eliminated in 2014, the ex-Metroliner cab <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> been used primarily on the Keystone Service and New Haven–Springfield Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Wipeout 2048 is {{a racing}} game which {{involves}} players piloting anti-gravity ships {{through a variety}} of scenarios. Set primarily in the year 2048, it is a prequel to the first instalment of the Wipeout series; dedicated race tracks have not yet been built, and races are held on city streets. The single-player game progresses through the first three years, 2048, 2049, and 2050, of the AGRC (Anti-Gravity Racing Championships). The game has four types of ships: speed ships, agility ships, fighters and prototypes. Speed ships (lightweight, Formula 1-like vehicles which emphasise acceleration and momentum) are primarily used for speed-oriented races, such as time trials. Agility ships, similar to rally <b>cars,</b> <b>have</b> increased manoeuvrability and handling; fighter ships are heavily armoured craft which sacrifice speed for combat power.|$|E
5|$|By mid-September 2015, {{the global}} stock of highway legal plug-in {{electric}} passenger cars and utility vans reached the one million sales milestone. Sales of plug-in electric vehicles achieved the one million milestone {{almost twice as}} fast as hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). While it took four years and 10 months to reach one-million PEV sales, it took more than around nine years and a few months for HEVs to reach its first million sales. The global ratio between all-electrics (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) has consistently been 60:40 between 2014 and the first half of 2016, mainly due to the large all-electric market in China. In the U.S. and Europe, the ratio is approaching a 50:50 split. All-electric <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> oversold plug-in hybrids, with pure electrics representing about 61% of the global stock of over 2million plug-ins on the world's roads by the end of 2016, up from 58.9% at the end of 2015. Cumulative global sales of highway-capable light-duty pure electric vehicles since 2010 achieved the one million unit milestone in September 2016. The global stock of plug-in hybrid cars totaled almost 800,000 units at the end of 2016.|$|E

5|$|In November 2013, a {{total of}} 2,736 Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEVs were sold, making the plug-in hybrid the top selling new car {{in the country that}} month, {{representing}} a market share of 6.8% of all the new cars sold. Again in December 2013, the Outlander P-HEV ranked as the top selling new car in the country with 4,976 units, representing a 12.6% market share of new car sales, contributing to a world record plug-in vehicle market share of 23.8% of new car sales. The Netherlands is the second country, after Norway, where plug-in electric <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> topped the monthly ranking of new car sales. The strong increase of plug-in car sles during the last months of 2013 was due {{to the end of the}} total exemption of the registration fee for corporate cars, which is valid for 5 years. From January 1, 2014, all-electric vehicles pay a 4% registration fee and plug-in hybrids a 7% fee.|$|E
5|$|Metro's {{rolling stock}} was {{acquired}} in six phases, and each version of car is {{identified with a}} separate series number. The original order of 300 rail cars (90 {{of which are in}} operation as of April 18, 2017) was manufactured by Rohr Industries, with final delivery in 1978.

Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie (Breda), now AnsaldoBreda, manufactured the second order of 76 cars delivered in 1983 and 1984. These cars, numbered 2000–2075, were rehabilitated in the early 2000s by Alstom in Hornell, New York. A third order of 288 cars, also from Breda, were delivered between 1984 and 1988. These cars are numbered 3000–3291 and were rehabilitated by Alstom in the early 2000s. An order of 100 cars from Breda, numbered 4000–4099, were delivered between 1992 and 1994.
