60|$|A burly {{figure had}} loomed {{up through the}} gloom on the path upon which they were going. As it approached, a <b>coloured</b> <b>lamp</b> {{dangling}} {{from one of the}} trees shone upon the blue and silver of an officer of the guards. It was Major de Brissac, of De Catinat's own regiment.|$|E
60|$|As soon as I {{was alone}} again, I {{began to ask}} myself whether I had been sleeping. Was this a dream--this wonderfully {{distinct}} vision--minute in its distinctness down to a patch of rainbow light on the pavement, transmitted through a <b>coloured</b> <b>lamp</b> {{in the shape of}} a star--of a strange city, quite unfamiliar to my imagination? I had seen no picture of Prague: it lay in my mind as a mere name, with vaguely-remembered historical associations--ill-defined memories of imperial grandeur and religious wars.|$|E
60|$|In this chamber {{assembled}} the expected guests. And having all arrived, they proceeded down a small gallery to the banqueting-room. The room {{was large and}} lofty. It was fitted up as an Eastern tent. The walls were hung with scarlet cloth, tied up with ropes of gold. Round the room crouched recumbent lions richly gilt, who grasped in their paws a lance, the top {{of which was a}} <b>coloured</b> <b>lamp.</b> The ceiling was emblazoned with the Hauteville arms, and was radiant with burnished gold. A cresset lamp was suspended from the centre of the shield, and not only emitted an equable flow of soft though brilliant light, but also, as the aromatic oil wasted away, distilled an exquisite perfume.|$|E
25|$|Scriabin's {{original}} colour keyboard, {{with its}} associated turntable of <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps,</b> is preserved {{in his apartment}} near the Arbat in Moscow, which is now a museum dedicated to his life and works.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is viewed}} from the side-on {{perspective}} typical of platform games. Jack, under the player's control, has to run, jump, climb and shoot {{his way through the}} kingdom of Allegoria in search of nine different <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps,</b> while under constant assault by all manner of creatures.|$|R
60|$|The {{conservatory}} looked inviting {{with the}} <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps</b> hanging among {{the flowers and}} screens of trailing plants throwing their shadows across warm, scented nooks. Walters, however, had framed his question injudiciously, because it implied a mutual desire to escape observation and confidential relations which did not exist.|$|R
5|$|From February 1922 the airfield, {{which was}} in use as an {{emergency}} landing ground, had an illuminated T {{as part of the}} illumination of the London-Paris airway. Also at the airfield were <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps</b> connected to an anemometer to indicate wind strength, green for no wind, white for moderate wind and red to indicate strong wind.|$|R
60|$|When {{the curtain}} rises, the {{circular}} platform is deserted. Statues of Buddha seated and recumbent fill the numberless niches in the wall, and before each burn long candles; heaped-up pink roses and japonica on brass trays are lit from above by swinging <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps.</b> At intervals are stalls laden with fruit and cheroots. All is mysterious, solemn, beautiful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Great joy to London now!" [...] {{says some}} great fool, [...] When London had a grand illumination, [...] Which to that bottle-conjuror, John Bull, [...] Is of all dreams the first hallucination; [...] So that {{the streets of}} <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps</b> are full, [...] That sage (said John) surrenders at discretion[ho] [...] His purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense, [...] To gratify, like a huge moth, this one sense.|$|R
60|$|The saloon at Allonby was a {{beautiful}} room, one end opening into a conservatory, full of <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps,</b> fresh green leaves, and hot-house plants. There they found as yet only the home party, the good-natured, merry Lord Kilcoran, his quiet English wife, who had bad health, and looked hardly equal to the confusion of the evening; Maurice, and two younger boys; Eveleen, and her two little sisters, Mabel and Helen.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1899 Silkeborg {{has hosted}} an event called [...] "Ildfestregatta", which means [...] "fire party regatta". Currently {{this event is}} held every third year, the last of which {{occurred}} on 13-16 August, 2014. During the regatta the city streets are closed to traffic in the evening, becoming temporary venues where live music is performed, merchandise is sold from stalls, and an amusement park operates. The houses next to the Gudenå River are decorated with <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps,</b> as are the many boats that enter the port at this time.|$|R
50|$|The theatre {{is notable}} {{for a number}} of {{pioneering}} concepts such as early use of reinforced concrete, stained glass details and a highly complex three-dimensional spatial arrangement. Its greatest feature is the geometric plaster ceiling. This was based on organic design principles of natural orders and are composed in a way which is both evocative and modern. The ceiling was indirectly lit and the lighting was used in conjunction with the original orchestral scores in the early silent film era to add drama for the spectator. Thousands of <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps</b> producing light that changed through all the various coloured hues in the spectral range were hidden amongst the plaster panels creating a crystalline cave effect.|$|R
60|$|A {{screaming}} for Gill was heard, and Mysie hastened to answer it. Lady Merrifield {{was too much}} tired {{to do anything but}} sit in the garden with Miss Mohun and look out at the ships, glittering with festoons of <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps,</b> reflected in the sea, but the young people went further afield, out on the cliff path to Rotherwood Park. The populace were mainly collected on the quay, and this formed a more select promenade, though by no means absolute solitude. Sir Jasper really did keep guard over the path along which Gillian allowed her Captain to conduct her, not exactly knowing which way they were going, and quite away from the bay and all its attractions.|$|R
50|$|From 1783, Maddox {{also created}} {{and ran a}} Vauxhall Gardens {{enterprise}} concurrently in the Moscow suburbs, where operas and plays were performed from mid-May to September. A long gallery led to a grand circular hall for dancing. From the dancing-hall {{there was a large}} area surrounded by a covered gallery, having in the middle an elevated platform for the orchestra. This gallery was chiefly used for promenading. Beyond this was a hall allotted to refreshments of all kinds. On the sides were billiards rooms. In the evenings the galleries were illuminated with <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps,</b> and on particular days fireworks displays were set off. It is likely that Maddox and his wife retained ownership of this after the Petrovsky was taken on by the Office of Imperial Theatres.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} find any sixpenny {{entrance}} and, fearing that the bazaar would be closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile, handing a shilling to a weary-looking man. I found myself in a big hall girdled at half its height by a gallery. Nearly all the stalls were closed and {{the greater part of}} the hall was in darkness. I recognised a silence like that which pervades a church after a service. I walked into the centre of the bazaar timidly. A few people were gathered about the stalls which were still open. Before a curtain, over which the words Cafe Chantant were written in <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps,</b> two men were counting money on a salver. I listened to the fall of the coins.|$|R
60|$|As the captain's voice {{could not}} be heard half-way to the bow, even {{with the aid of}} the ancient speaking-trumpet, that {{instrument}} is supplanted by semaphore signals by day, and <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps</b> by night; the electric telegraph is also used in connection with the engine-rooms. There are ten anchors, four of them being Trotman's patent, weighing seven tons each. The cables are each 400 fathoms long, and their united weight is 100 tons. The tonnage of the Great Eastern is 18,500 tons register, and 22,500 tons builders' measurement. The crew at first consisted of thirteen officers, seventeen engineers, a sailing-master, and a purser, four hundred men, and two or three surgeons, all under the command of the late Captain W. Harrison, (formerly of the Cunard line).|$|R
60|$|But it {{is eight}} o'clock; {{we are already}} rather late. Is that a figure by Holbein, just started out of the canvas, that I am about to meet? Stand aside! It is a page of the Emperor Charles the Fifth! The Court {{is on its way}} to the theatre. The theatre and the gardens are brilliantly illuminated. The effect of the {{thousands}} of <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps,</b> in all parts of the foliage, is very beautiful. The moon is up, and a million stars! If it be not quite as light as day, it is just light enough for pleasure. You could not perhaps endorse a bill of exchange, or engross a parchment, by this light; but then it is just the light to read a love-letter by, and do a thousand other things besides.|$|R
60|$|At length {{they arrived}} in the capital, where the public rejoicings were grander and more {{brilliant}} than anywhere else. The queen awaited them in the great hall of the palace, surrounded by her entire court. It was getting dark, and hundreds of <b>coloured</b> hanging <b>lamps</b> were lit to turn night into day.|$|R
60|$|Unknown to anyone, {{the emperor}} had stolen out on horseback, and had hidden {{himself on the}} hill, where he could see all that happened. When all was over, {{and the power of}} the dragon was broken for ever, he rode quickly back to the castle, and was ready to receive the prince with open arms, and to promise him his {{daughter}} to wife. The wedding took place with great splendour, and for a whole week the town was hung with <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps,</b> and tables were spread in the hall of the castle for all who chose to come and eat. And when the feast was over, the prince told the emperor and the people who he really was, and at this everyone rejoiced still more, and preparations were made for the prince and princess to return to their own kingdom, for the prince was impatient to set free his brothers.|$|R
60|$|During {{the evening}} {{she sat with}} Lieutenant Walters in the conservatory. There were other guests at Hazlehurst, and Mrs. Foster had asked some of her {{neighbours}} to join them in an informal dance. <b>Coloured</b> <b>lamps</b> hung among the plants, throwing a soft light upon clustering blossoms and forcing up delicate foliage in black silhouette. Here and there lay belts of shadow, out of which came voices and a smell of cigar smoke; but near where Mrs. Chudleigh sat screened by a palm a French window opened into the hall. The half-light that fell sideways upon her face suited her, for it failed to reveal the hardness of her lips and eyes, and made her look gentler. Walters, who was charmed with her, had no suspicion that she had cultivated his society merely because she thought he might prove useful. On hearing what regiment he belonged to, she had marked him down for study.|$|R
50|$|Leeds {{is notable}} for designing, {{manufacturing}} and maintaining its own Christmas Light motifs. Its workshop {{began as a}} place to provide people with disabilities some employment opportunities. Its workshop has had several locations, beginning in a temporary location near Chapeltown Road, then to the old disused Whitbread Brewery site at Kirkstall and from 1993 to the present Seacroft location. Leeds City Council was the only local authority to do this for some years but now a small number have followed Leeds Lights example in preparing their own displays where as most other councils buy in their lights and services. The lights are repaired and pressure cleaned annually at the Leeds Lights workshop in Seacroft throughout the year. 80,000 <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps</b> are stored at the workshop, and 2000m of coloured rope light are used. A team of 14 works all year round producing the display. From October-January, a team of 9 works to erect the lights ready for the switch on in early November, before removing the lights after Christmas.|$|R
6000|$|For {{three or}} four months after the bishop's visit had given the signal for society to admit Sophy Needham within its circle, the {{intercourse}} was restricted to morning calls of an extremely formal nature, which seemed by no means likely to bring about the result, to obtain which Mr. Harmer had emerged from his solitude; he made up his mind, therefore, to break the ice, which again seemed setting over the surface of the Canterbury society, by giving a series of picnics and open air fêtes. The first of these took place early in June, when I was away at school; but I heard full particulars of it upon my return. The whole of the inhabitants of Canterbury and the neighbourhood whose position rendered them eligible were invited, together with the officers of the garrison, a very necessary addition at Canterbury, where dancing young men are almost unknown. A large marquee was erected and boarded for dancing, a quadrille band brought down from London, and the military band engaged for the afternoon. Archery butts were set up, bowling-greens mowed and rolled, and <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps</b> placed in all the walks, to be illuminated after dusk. People met at between three and four, had a substantial tea at six, and a magnificent supper at eleven. Nothing, in short, which taste and an unlimited purse could do, was neglected, and the result was a splendid success. And yet early in the evening a difference had arisen which would have marred the pleasure of the whole scene {{had it not been for}} the firmness of Mr. Harmer. It seemed that soon after nine o'clock when it began to get dusk, some of the ladies of the precincts had objected strongly to the <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps</b> which had just been lighted, and which began to sparkle in the trees and grass by the side of the various walks. Not in themselves, for they allowed the effect to be very pretty; but as offering inducements and pretexts for isolated couples to stroll away, and get entirely beyond maternal supervision. Two of the ladies waited upon Mr. Harmer as a sort of deputation from the others, and it happened that one of them was the chief of the party who had opposed Sophy Needham's introduction into society, but who had at last come to the conclusion that, as others were going, it would be showing a want of Christian feeling to refuse to do as others did. These ladies recited to Mr. Harmer the objections they entertained, and concluded-- ...|$|R
5000|$|For {{many years}} {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, Ludlow Castle was the home of the Commissioner of Delhi, who often hosted visiting dignitaries there. From February 5 to 9, 1870, Prince Alfred, the second son of Queen Victoria and the then Duke of Edinburgh, was the guest of the Commissioner of Delhi, Col. McNeile, in Ludlow Castle. [...] After {{arriving}} in Delhi in the late afternoon, and after an early dinner, the prince was taken on a tour of Old Delhi. [...] Accompanying surgeon Joseph Fayrer recorded the evening enthusiastically: [...] The Duke was in the howdah with Colonel McNeile. ... The road to the Lahore Gate was beautifully illuminated with <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps</b> hanging from the trees; the effect was excellent, and free from the formality of continuous lines of light. There were triumphal arches in the Chandney Chowk and Dureeba, and up to the front of the steps of the Jumma Musjid was one continuous blaze of Bengal lights and other forms of illumination. The streets, and every house-top, window and balcony were crowded; numbers preceding the elephants, joining the European soldiers in loud hurrahs, made a most exciting scene. Dismounting at the foot of the Jumma Musjid, the Duke, with many ladies and gentlemen, witnessed a grand displayof fireworks from the platform of the mosque. They then returned to Ludlow Castle.|$|R
5000|$|Wonderland City was an {{amusement}} park located at Tamarama, on Wonderland Avenue near {{the point at which}} it joins Fletcher Street, in Sydney, Australia. [...] It opened on Saturday, 1 December 1906 and closed in 1911. At the time it was the largest open air amusement park in the southern hemisphere. The 20 acre amusement park was operated by theatrical entrepreneur William Anderson. During its operation the colossal playground had a balloon could go up to about 3,800 feet (1158.24 meters) high.

50|$|Just {{before sunset}} on Christmas Eve 1921, all adult and junior {{members from the}} centres of Marsa, Blata l-Bajda and Hamrun began to {{assemble}} at 6, Fra Diegu Street, Hamrun, where 14 years earlier Dun Gorg has started his Society of Christian Doctrine. Some came along with lanterns like those used by altar boys accompanying the Viaticum, other brought their father's bicycle headlamp lit by acetylene gas, others carried paraffin hurricane lamps and even candle-lit lanterns used by farmers on their carts; younger children brought <b>coloured</b> paper <b>lamps</b> and Venetian lights. Some even carried palm fronds and olive branches while others improvised lanterns made of hewn small pumpkins lit by candle.|$|R
60|$|When Lord Montfort and Henrietta {{succeeded in}} {{discovering}} the duchess, {{she was in}} the conservatory, which was gaily illuminated with <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps</b> among the shrubs. Her Grace was conversing with cordiality with a lady of very prepossessing appearance, in whom the traces of a beauty once distinguished were indeed still considerable, and her companion, an extremely pretty person, in the very bloom of girlhood. Lord Montfort and Henrietta were immediately introduced to these ladies, as Lady Armine and Miss Grandison. After the scene of the morning, it was not easy to deprive Miss Temple of her equanimity; after that shock, no incident connected with the Armine family could be surprising; she was even desirous of becoming acquainted with Miss Grandison, and she congratulated herself upon the opportunity which had so speedily offered itself to gratify her wishes. The duchess was perfectly delighted with Lady Armine, whose manners were fascinating; between the families there was some connection of blood, and Lady Armine, too, had always retained a lively sense of the old duke's services to her son. Henrietta had even to listen to enquiries made after Ferdinand, and she learnt that he was slowly recovering from an almost fatal illness, that he could not endure the fatigues of society, and that he was even living at an hotel for the sake of quiet. Henrietta watched the countenance of Katherine, as Lady Armine gave this information. It was serious, but not disturbed. Her Grace did not separate from her new friends the whole of the evening, and they parted with a mutually expressed wish that they might speedily and often meet. The duchess pronounced Lady Armine the most charming person she had ever met; while, on the other hand, Miss Grandison was warm in her admiration of Henrietta Temple and Lord Montfort, whom she thought quite worthy even of so rare a prize.|$|R
60|$|The old pagan {{kept his}} promise to his dying wife. Lady Yarmouth was now in full favour, and treated with {{profound}} respect by the Hanover society, though it appears rather neglected in England when she came among us. In 1740, {{a couple of the}} king’s daughters went to see him at Hanover; Anna, the Princess of Orange (about whom, and whose husband and marriage-day, Walpole and Hervey have left us the most ludicrous descriptions), and Maria of Hesse-Cassel, with their respective lords. This made the Hanover Court very brilliant. In honour of his high guests, the king gave several fêtes; among others, a magnificent masked ball, in the green theatre at Herrenhausen—the garden theatre, with linden and box for screen, and grass for a carpet, where the Platens had danced to George and his father the late sultan. The stage and a great part of the garden were illuminated with <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps.</b> Almost the whole Court appeared in white dominos, “like,” says the describer of the scene, “like spirits in the Elysian fields. At night, supper was served in the gallery with three great tables, and the king was very merry. After supper dancing was resumed, and I did not get home till five o’clock by full daylight to Hanover. Some days afterwards we had in the opera-house at Hanover, a great assembly. The king appeared in a Turkish dress; his turban was ornamented with a magnificent agraffe of diamonds; the Lady Yarmouth was dressed as a sultana; nobody was more beautiful than the Princess of Hesse.” So, while poor Caroline was resting in her coffin, dapper little George, with his red face and his white eyebrows and goggle-eyes, at sixty years of age, is dancing a pretty dance with Madame Walmoden, and capering about dressed up like a Turk! For twenty years more, that little old Bajazet went on in this Turkish fashion, until the fit came which choked the old man, when he ordered the side of his coffin to be taken out, {{as well as that of}} poor Caroline’s who had preceded him, so that his sinful old bones and ashes might mingle with those of the faithful creature. O strutting Turkey-cock of Herrenhausen! O naughty little Mahomet! in what Turkish paradise are you now, and where be your painted houris? So Countess Yarmouth appeared as a sultana, and his Majesty in a Turkish dress wore an agraffe of diamonds, and was very merry, was he? Friends! he was your fathers’ king as well as mine—let us drop a respectful tear over his grave.|$|R
40|$|Axenfeld-Rieger {{syndrome}} is an uncommon autosomal dominant condition characterized by anterior segment dysgenesis and systemic abnormalities. We report {{a case of}} Axenfeld Rieger syndrome associated with secondary developmental glaucoma who remained undiagnosed since childhood. Twenty-one year old male patient presented with progressive dimness of vision and <b>coloured</b> halos. Slit <b>lamp</b> examination showed scleral thinning and megalocornea in both the eyes and iris hypoplasia in the right eye only. Posterior embryotoxon, few tissue bands, high insertion of the iris roots and anterior synechiae were seen on gonioscopy. Intraocular pressure was 32 mmHg in the right eye and 38 mmHg in the left eye. Glaucomatous disc changes were observed in both eyes on fundus examination. Systemic features such as maxillary hypoplasia, oligodontia, microdontia, taurodontism, micrognathia and redundant periumbilical skin were observed. ...|$|R
60|$|But {{why should}} I risk too free a comparison, where this picturesque and amiable class are concerned? I delight in their sun-burnt complexions and their childish dialect; I know them {{only by their}} merits, and I am grossly prejudiced in their favour. They are {{interesting}} and touching, and alike in their virtues and their defects human nature is simplified as with a big effective brush. Affecting above all is their dependence on the stranger, the whimsical stranger who swims out of their ken, yet whom Providence sometimes restores. The best of them at any rate are in their line great artists. On the swarming feast- days, on the strange feast-night of the Redentore, their steering is a miracle of ease. The master-hands, the celebrities and winners of prizes--you may see them on the private gondolas in spotless white, with brilliant sashes and ribbons, and often with very handsome persons--take {{the right of way}} with a pardonable insolence. They penetrate the crush of boats with an authority of their own. The crush of boats, the universal sociable bumping and squeezing, is great when, on the summer nights, the ladies shriek with alarm, the city pays the fiddlers, and the illuminated barges, scattering music and song, lead a long train down the Canal. The barges used to be rowed in rhythmic strokes, but now they are towed by the steamer. The <b>coloured</b> <b>lamps,</b> the vocalists before the hotels, are not to my sense the greatest seduction of Venice; but it would be an uncandid sketch of the Canalazzo that shouldn't touch them with indulgence. Taking one nuisance with another, they are probably the prettiest in the world, and if they have in general more magic for the new arrival than for the old Venice-lover, they in any case, at their best, keep up the immemorial tradition. The Venetians have had from the beginning of time the pride of their processions and spectacles, and it's a wonder how with empty pockets they still make a clever show. The Carnival is dead, but these are the scraps of its inheritance. Vauxhall on the water is of course more Vauxhall than ever, with the good fortune of home-made music and of a mirror that reduplicates and multiplies. The feast of the Redeemer--the great popular feast of the year--is a wonderful Venetian Vauxhall. All Venice on this occasion takes to the boats for the night and loads them with lamps and provisions. Wedged together in a mass it sups and sings; every boat is a floating arbour, a private café-concert. Of all Christian commemorations it is the most ingenuously and harmlessly pagan. Toward morning the passengers repair to the Lido, where, as the sun rises, they plunge, still sociably, into the sea. The night of the Redentore has been described, but {{it would be interesting to}} have an account, from the domestic point of view, of its usual morrow. It is mainly an affair of the Giudecca, however, which is bridged over from the Zattere to the great church. The pontoons are laid together during the day--it is all done with extraordinary celerity and art--and the bridge is prolonged across the Canalazzo (to Santa Maria Zobenigo), which is my only warrant for glancing at the occasion. We glance at it from our palace windows; lengthening our necks a little, as we look up toward the Salute, we see all Venice, on the July afternoon, so serried as to move slowly, pour across the temporary footway. It is a flock of very good children, and the bridged Canal is their toy. All Venice on such occasions is gentle and friendly; not even all Venice pushes anyone into the water.|$|R
60|$|But {{there is}} no space to tell how we fed, with a prairie appetite, in the men's quarters, on a meal {{prepared}} by an artist; how we raced home at speeds no child could ever hear of, and no grown-up should attempt; how the motors squattered at the ford, and took pot-shots at the pontoon till even Charon smiled; how great horses hauled the motors up the gravelly bank into the town; how there we met people in their Sunday best, walking and driving, and pulled ourselves together, and looked virtuous; and how the merry company suddenly and quietly evanished because they thought that their guests might be tired. I can give you no notion of the pure, irresponsible frolic of it--of the almost affectionate kindness, the gay and inventive hospitality that so delicately controlled the whole affair--any more than I can describe a certain quiet half-hour in the dusk just before we left, when the company gathered to say good-bye, while young couples walked in the street, and {{the glare of the}} never-extinguished natural-gas <b>lamps</b> <b>coloured</b> the leaves of the trees a stage green.|$|R
