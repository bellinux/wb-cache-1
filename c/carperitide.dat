40|$|Yasuchika Takeishi, MD 1, and {{on behalf}} of the AVCMA investigators† Backgroud: Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a common and highly morbid {{cardiovascular}} disorder. Diuresis is a major therapy for the reduction of congestive symptoms. However, most diuretics cause hyponatremia, which is a worsening factor of ADHF patients prognosis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan, which is a selective vasopressin V 2 receptor antagonist and produces water excretion without changes in sodium excretion, compared with <b>carperitide.</b> Methods and Results:One hundred and nine hospitalized ADHF patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to tolvaptan or <b>carperitide</b> treatment groups. Subjective symptoms and plasma BNP level were similarly improved by treatment in both groups. Urine volume was significantly higher in the tolvaptan group (P<. 05), but volume of water intake was also higher in the tolvaptan group (P<. 05). Blood pressure was significantly lower in the <b>carperitide</b> group than in the tolvaptan group after treatment (P<. 05). Less adverse events such as worsening heart failure and hypotension requiring drug discontinuation were observed in the tolvaptan group (P. 027).

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effects of tolvaptan (T group) and <b>carperitide</b> (C group) in these patients. Sixty-one consecutive patients admitted to the Iwate Prefectural Kuji Hospital or the Emergency Center of the Iwate Medical University between July 2011 and April 2015 were included in this study.

40|$|Background]: The {{ambulatory}} {{treatment of}} advanced heart failure (HF) with intermittent infusions of inotropes or natriuretic peptide chosen immediately before each infusion {{has not been}} described. [Methods]: Between May 2005 and July 2009, we treated 11 patients presenting with advanced HF, who received a total of 369 infusions of <b>carperitide,</b> olprinone, dopamine, or dobutamine, once or twice weekly. The pharmaceutical was selected before each infusion based on the systolic blood pressure (BP). [Results]: <b>Carperitide,</b> olprinone, and catecholamines were administered to 8 (73 infusions of 0. 030 ± 0. 004 μg/kg/min for 3. 3 ± 0. 8 h), 4 (18 infusions of 0. 070 ± 0. 017 μg/kg/min for 3. 3 ± 0. 5 h), and 6 patients (278 infusions of 3. 6 ± 1. 9 μg/kg/min for 2. 8 ± 1. 0 h), respectively. No adverse effect requiring cessation of infusion was observed. Over a mean follow-up of 29. 3 ± 28. 8 months (range 2 – 104), 4 patients died, all from cardiac causes. The Kaplan–Meier cumulative survival rate was 69. 3 % at 20 months (median follow-up). Compared with the pre-infusion period, the duration and number of hospitalizations for management of HF were decreased by 73. 9 % (p = 0. 017), and 51. 9 % (p = 0. 007), respectively, during the treatment period, and the overall medical costs by 56. 9 % (p = 0. 021). [Conclusions]: In this study population, intermittent drug infusions selected from inotropes or natriuretic peptide based on the baseline systolic BP significantly decreased the length and number of hospitalizations and costs, without increasing mortality.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe characteristics, {{in-hospital}} management, {{and outcomes}} of patients hospitalized with worsening heart failure (HF) {{have been described}} by large-scale registries performed mainly in the USA and Europe. However, little information is available in Japan. We thus clarified the characteristics and clinical status as well as in-hospital management and outcomes among patients hospitalized with worsening HF in Japan and compared them with those reported in previous studies. MethodsThe Japanese Cardiac Registry of Heart Failure in Cardiology (JCARE-CARD) studied prospectively the characteristics and treatments in patients hospitalized with worsening HF. From the total cohort of JCARE-CARD, 1677 patients were randomly selected and their detailed data during acute phase were collected as another registry database in the present study. The characteristics, in-hospital management, and outcomes were analyzed. ResultsThe mean age was 70. 7 years and 59. 4 % were male. Etiology was ischemic in 34. 0 % and mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 42. 5 %. <b>Carperitide</b> was highly used as in-hospital management in Japan (33. 5 %) {{compared to the use}} of nesiritide in the USA (8 – 11 %). The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was lower and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) were more commonly used in this study compared to other studies in the USA and Europe. In-hospital crude mortality rate was comparable among studies (4 – 8 %), however, length of stay was longer in Japan (15 – 20 versus 4 – 9 days). ConclusionsThe characteristics, clinical status, and laboratory data on admission in patients hospitalized with worsening HF were similar between the present study and previous Japanese and western studies. Management was also similar except for higher use of <b>carperitide</b> and ARB. The most striking difference between Japanese registries and those from the USA and Europe was the longer length of stay...|$|E

Though he immediately started to receive both heparin sodium at a dose of 10, 000 units/day and warfarin potassium at a dose of 2 mg/day to avoid thrombus after admission, activated partial thromboplastin (APTT) time and prothrombin time-International normalized ratio (PT-INR) failed to be sufficiently prolonged. A few floating thrombi about 2 centimeters in diameter appeared around the apex of the left ventricle when his left ventricle was assessed by echocardiography after only 3 days.

30|$|In the {{operating}} room, a continuous monitoring of electrocardiography, SpO 2, systemic arterial pressure via a right radial artery catheter, bispectral index (BIS; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN), and regional cerebral oxygen saturation {{at the right}} and left forehead (INVOS™ 5100 C, Somanetics, USA) was initiated before anesthesia induction. After administration of 100 % oxygen, general anesthesia was induced slowly by intravenous administration of 3  mg of midazolam, 0.5  mg of fentanyl, and 50  mg of rocuronium. Additionally, dobutamine (3.3  μg/kg/min), nicorandil (1.1  μg/kg/min), which has the dual properties of a nitrate and a potassium channel opener, and <b>carperitide</b> (33  ng/kg/min) were continuously administered to minimize anesthetic-induced cardiac depression. During anesthesia induction and tracheal intubation, his circulatory and respiratory status remained stable. After tracheal intubation, a transesophageal echocardiography probe was inserted. Then, a central venous catheter and right heart catheter were inserted via the right internal jugular vein. The latter catheter (Swan Ganz catheter) was guided to the right pulmonary artery under fluoroscopic control because of his unique anatomy with interatrial baffle.|$|E
40|$|Natriuretic {{peptides}} (NPs) {{comprise a}} family of vasoactive hormones that play important roles in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal homeostasis. Along this line, atrial NP (ANP) (international non-proprietary name: <b>carperitide,</b> HANP) is an approved drug {{for the treatment of}} acute heart failure. In recent years, evidence has been given that the NP system possesses a far broader biological spectrum than the regulation of blood pressure and volume homeostasis. In fact, a substantial amount of in vitro work indicates that ANP affects important inflammatory processes and signaling pathways. Quite surprisingly, however, no information exists on the in vivo antiinflammatory potential and signaling of ANP. We show here that pretreatment of lipopolysaccharide (Salmonella abortus equi, 2. 5 mg/kg) -challenged mice with ANP (5 μg/kg iv, 15 min) rapidly inhibits nuclear factor-κB activation via inhibition of phosphorylation and degradation of the IκB-α protein. ANP also reduces Akt activation upon lipopolysaccharide injection. In ANP-pretreated mice, the increase of TNF-α serum concentration is markedly prevented; most importantly, the survival of these animals improved. These findings demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo an antiinflammatory profile of ANP that deserves to be further investigated in a therapeutic perspective. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA 47 -year-old Japanese {{woman was}} transported to our {{hospital}} due to acute heart failure (AHF). She {{had been diagnosed}} with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) and undergone parathyroidectomy 3 months previously. Chest X-ray showed marked cardiomegaly and severe pulmonary congestion, and transthoracic echocardiography indicated both left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic dysfunction, complicated with extensive massive myocardial calcification and no LV hypertrophy. Computed tomography also showed massive myocardial calcification in the posterior wall of the LV and the interventricular septum. After treatment with furosemide, olprinone, and <b>carperitide</b> under Swan-Ganz monitoring, LV ejection fraction was almost normalized. However, cardiac catheterization in the chronic phase indicated that LV diastolic dysfunction still existed, which might be affected by myocardial calcification. We followed this patient using spironolactone (25 mg/day), perindopril (8 mg/day), and bisoprolol (1. 25 mg/day), with no further episode of heart failure for at least 6 months. Here, we report a rare case of AHF complicated with massive myocardial calcification possibly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. <Learning objective: This is the first case report of acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, complicated with massive myocardial calcification, “porcelain heart”, possibly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. ...|$|E
30|$|Spontaneous biliary {{peritonitis}} {{is rare in}} adults. We herein report a case of spontaneous {{biliary peritonitis}}. An 84 -year-old man was admitted to our hospital for abdominal pain for 5  days. He developed fever, jaundice, and abdominal rigidity. Computed tomography (CT) revealed massive ascites in the omental bursa and around the liver. The ascites obtained by diagnostic paracentesis was dark yellow-green in color, which implied bile leakage. With a diagnosis of bile peritonitis, the patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy. There was massive biliary ascites in the abdominal cavity, especially in the omental bursa. Because exploration failed to demonstrate the perforation site in the gallbladder and biliary duct, we performed abdominal lavage alone. Postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed stones in the common bile duct, {{and there was no}} evidence of biliary leakage. Endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage was performed using a plastic stent to reduce the pressure of the common bile duct. After the operation, the patient showed satisfactory recovery and started oral intake on postoperative day 8. However, the patient developed heart failure due to renal dysfunction with nephrotic syndrome at 1  month after the operation. With a diagnosis of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis due to immune complex, the patient received steroid treatment for nephritis, diuretics, and <b>carperitide</b> for heart failure. Although heart failure and renal dysfunction improved by these treatment, the patients developed toxic epidermal necrolysis which was refractory to intensive treatments including steroid pulse and immunoglobulin, and the patient died 76  days after the operation.|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (<b>carperitide)</b> and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP; nesiritide) {{are used}} to treat {{congestive}} heart failure. However, despite beneficial cardiac unloading properties, reductions in renal perfusion pressures limit their clinical effectiveness. Recently, CD-NP, a chimeric peptide composed of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) fused to the C-terminal tail of Dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP), was shown to be more glomerular filtration rate-enhancing than BNP in dogs. However, the molecular basis for the increased responsiveness was not determined. Here, we show that the DNP tail has a striking effect on CNP, converting it from a non-agonist to a partial agonist of natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR) -A while maintaining the ability to activate NPR-B. This effect is specific for human receptors because CD-NP was only a slightly better activator of rat NPR-A due to the promiscuous nature of CNP in this species. Interesting, the DNP tail alone {{had no effect on}} any NPR even though it is effective in vivo. To further increase the potency of CD-NP for NPR-A, we converted two different triplet sequences within the CNP ring to their corresponding residues in BNP. Both variants demonstrated increased affinity and full agonist activity for NPR-A, whereas one was as potent as any NPR-A activator known. In contrast to a previous report, we found that DNP binds the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (NPR-C). However, none of the chimeric peptides bound NPR-C with significantly higher affinity than endogenous ligands. We suggest that bifunctional chimeric peptides represent a new generation of natriuretic peptide therapeutics...|$|E
30|$|Transplanted lungs {{are highly}} {{susceptible}} to fluid overload {{over a long}} period. Lymphatic interruption {{increases the risk of}} extravascular lung water accumulation [11] and it may be responsible for pulmonary edema development following even minimal fluid overload [12]. In this case, lymph node dissection, which removed newly established graft lymphatics, division of thoracic adhesions, and the placement of gastric conduit, which passed through the right posterior mediastinum, were performed. These procedures had the potentials to induce interstitial lung edema and subsequent pulmonary dysfunction, because of encouraging inflammation of lung tissue, hemorrhage, prolonged surgery, and increased transfusion. To reduce the transfusions and maintain low central venous pressure, which inhibit the increase in interstitial lung water [13], we used phenylephrine and noradrenaline for maintenance of adequate blood pressure, and <b>carperitide</b> for excretion of excess lung fluid during anesthesia. These treatments may have contributed to prevent further deterioration of the right lung edema and the progression to pulmonary dysfunction or rejection. In this case, we monitored arterial blood pressure and CVP for the assessment of hemodynamics, but CVP, fluctuating with changes of intrathoracic pressure, was inaccurate index of cardiac preload. Therefore, transpulmonary thermodilution technique might be better to assess the hemodynamics of patients like this case. But we did not use transpulmonary thermodilution technique in this case, because the cardiac function of the patient was normal and lithotomy position during abdominal manipulation could cause femoral arterial catheter kinking, although the measurement of extravascular lung water and pulmonary vascular permeability index would be useful in the postoperative managements of the patient. Furthermore, the reduction in blood flow to her bronchi during esophagectomy was of concern because the bronchial arteries had been eliminated from her lung. However, bronchoscopy during perioperative surgery showed the preservation of blood flow to her bronchi. Whereas, intravascular refilling and diuretic phase occurred in comparatively later POD (during the third POD and fourth POD). This might be because the dissection of the lung graft lymph node impaired the lymphatic drainage and removal of excess lung fluid.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundNon-invasive {{positive}} pressure ventilation (NPPV) for acute {{heart failure}} (AHF) is increasingly used to avoid endotracheal intubation (ETI). We therefore reviewed our experience using respirator {{management in the}} emergency room for AHF, and evaluated the predictive factors in the success of NPPV {{in the emergency room}}. Methods and resultsThree-hundred forty-three patients with AHF were analyzed. The AHF patients were assigned to either BiPAP-Synchrony® (B-S; Respironics, Merrysville, PA, USA) period (2005 – 2007, n= 176) or BiPAP-Vision® (B-V; Respironics) period (2008 – 2010, n= 167). The rate of <b>carperitide</b> use was significantly increased and dopamine use was significantly decreased in the B-V period. The total length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the B-V period. AHF patients were also assigned to a failed trial of NPPV followed by ETI (NPPV failure group) or an NPPV success group in the emergency room for each period. NPPV was successfully used in 48 cases in the B-S period, and in 111 cases in the B-V period. Fifty-seven ETI patients included 45 direct ETI and 11 NPPV failure cases in the B-S period, and 16 ETI patients included 10 direct ETI and 6 NPPV failure cases in the B-V period. The pH values were significantly lower in the NPPV failure than in the NPPV success for both periods (7. 19 ± 0. 10 vs. 7. 28 ± 0. 11, B-S period, p< 0. 05; 7. 05 ± 0. 08 vs. 7. 27 ± 0. 14, B-V period, p< 0. 001). A pH value of 7. 20 produced the optimal balance in the B-S period, while that of 7. 03 produced the optimal balance in B-V periods by the ROC curve analysis. The cutoff value of pH was lower in the B-V period than in the B-S period. ConclusionsThis predictive value provides successful estimates of NPPV with a high sensitivity and specificity, and the aortic blood gas level was above 7. 03 pH when using the B-V system...|$|E
30|$|There {{were several}} {{limitations}} in this study. First, {{the number of}} patients was small and derived from a single center. Even though many preoperative factors including age, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, DM, chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, and IABP have been reported as the independent risk factors for AKI in early studies, we could not identify the only two independent factors [4, 5, 9, 21, 22]. There may be possible selection bias and a lack of power. Second, data for the cardiac index were missing in about 19 % of the study populations that included four patients with AKI. This may decrease the power of this study to evaluate this hemodynamic parameter as risk factors for AKI. Third, we did not analyze the intraoperative systemic blood pressure. Several previous observational studies reported that lower mean arterial pressure during surgery was involved in postoperative AKI [51, 52]. However, we could not collect the detailed data for arterial blood pressure due to the form of this retrospective survey. Additionally, we frequently altered the bed positioning to maintain hemodynamic condition during anastomosis, which readily affected the arterial blood pressure by changing the positional relation between introducer and right atrium. If the detailed data on arterial blood pressure was collected, the validity and reliability of the data might not have been guaranteed. Thus, as the index indirectly reflecting systemic perfusion pressure, we investigated the dose of vasopressors, which was not significantly associated with AKI in the present study. Finally, this study was a retrospective, observational study, and thus, causality between furosemide and AKI could not be established. It was possible that furosemide did not increase the incidence of AKI, as it was only used by patients who were likely to have renal impairment due to other means. However, whether furosemide was used against transient oliguria that might indicate postoperative AKI or not, urine output was recovered in most patients administered furosemide, and another diuretic, <b>carperitide,</b> did not affect the incidence of AKI. Thus, we could not deny that the use of furosemide itself had an adverse effect on postoperative AKI.|$|E

Compared to hydration, ORs (95 % credible intervals) for contrast-induced AKI were 0. 31 (0. 14 - 0. 60) for high-dose statin plus NAC, 0. 37 (0. 19 - 0. 64) for high-dose statin alone, 0. 37 (0. 17 - 0. 72) for prostaglandins, 0. 48 (0. 26 - 0. 82) for theophylline, 0. 62 (0. 40 - 0. 88) for bicarbonate sodium plus NAC, 0. 67 (0. 54 - 0. 81) for NAC alone, 0. 64 (0. 41 - 0. 95) for vitamins and analogues, 0. 70 (0. 29 - 1. 37) for natriuretic peptides, 0. 69 (0. 31 - 1. 37) for fenoldopam, 0. 78 (0. 59 - 1. 01) for bicarbonate sodium, and 0. 98 (0. 41 - 2. 07) for low-dose statin. High-dose statin plus NAC or high-dose statin alone {{were likely to be}} ranked the best or the second best for preventing contrast-induced AKI. The overall results were not materially changed in metaregressions or subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Limitations: Patient-level data were unavailable; unable to include some treatment agents; low event rates; imbalanced distribution of participants among treatment strategies. Conclusions: High-dose statins plus hydration with or without NAC might be the preferred treatment strategy to prevent contrast-induced AKI in patients undergoing diagnostic and/or interventional procedures requiring contrast media...|$|E

The efficacy of synthetic human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP) for nephrotic syndrome to ameliorate the systemic edema and retain renal functions has not been fully demonstrated. Trial design: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial. Patients were randomly assigned by a stratified biased coin design. Methods: A total of 12 patients with nephrotic syndrome {{between the ages of}} 20 to 79 years were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the conventional (CON) group treated with furosemide and albumin, and hANP group, in which <b>carperitide</b> was administered in addition to the conventional therapies. The primary end points were: (1) the differences in serum creatinine levels, and (2) the reduction of total dosage of furosemide and albumin by the treatments of hANP. Secondary end points were body weight, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, serum protein, albumin, and urinary protein excretion. Results: A total of 13 patients were enrolled, and one patient was excluded due to severe pneumonia. In both hANP (n = 7) and CON (n = 5) groups, body weight was reduced after 2 -week treatments. Serum creatinine levels at follow-up significantly increased compared with baseline. The increase in serum creatinine levels (&Delta; serum creatinine) was smaller in the hANP group compared with the CON group (P = 0. 31). The serum uric acid, serum urea nitrogen, and urinary protein excretion were reduced in the hANP group, and increased in the CON group, though these differences were not statistically significant. The usage of hANP significantly reduced the total dosage of furosemide (P &lt; 0. 05) during the treatment periods. No adverse effects were observed. Conclusions: The concomitant use of synthetic hANP with conventional therapies is beneficial for reducing the dosage of loop diuretics, and the elevation of serum creatinine and uric acid may be avoided.
