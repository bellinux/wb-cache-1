The crew decipher these artifacts and deduce that Odin may actually exist as a place, the paradise planet so often spoken of in mythology. The young crew is eager to make the journey but the captain and the ship's senior officers observe the need to follow the orders of Earth Command and return to Earth immediately. The crew mutinies and locks the senior officers in the officer's lounge and warp the ship to the location given in the artifacts. Upon arrival, the Starlight meet a cosmic being who appears before them in space. He identifies himself as Asgard and declares that he will block the gateway to paradise against corrupt beings of flesh and all other non-believers. As a result, the Starlight faces an almost endless swarm of mechanized attack ships. The Starlight crew successfully fights its way through to land on {{what appears to be a}} mechanized world only to face hordes of mechanized soldiers. Surviving the onslaught, Sara and the crew is horrified to learn that these soldiers are actually part living beings. A dying soldier hands a crew member a <b>crystal</b> <b>memory</b> chip and asks him to insert it into a computer display readout. Through it, the crew learn of the soldier's memories of Odin and the entire story of the alien people's exodus.|$|E

By combining the storage process of a quantum memory for photons with fluorescence-based quantum state measurement, it is, in principle, possible to achieve high-efficiency photon counting in large ensembles of atoms. The large number of atoms can, however, pose significant problems in terms of noise stemming from imperfect initial state preparation and off-resonant fluorescence. We identify and analyse a concrete implementation of a photon number resolving detector based on an ion Coulomb crystal inside a moderately high-finesse optical cavity. The cavity enhancement leads to an effective optical depth of 15 for a finesse of 3000 with only about 1500 ions interacting with the light field. We show that these values allow for essentially noiseless detection with an efficiency larger than 93 %. Moderate experimental parameters allow for repetition rates of about 3 kHz, limited by the time needed for fluorescence collection and re-cooling of the ions between trials.

The memory-state-dependent PV effect of the Pt/Nd:STO/In device is obtained by the switching voltage. These complimentary effects are attributed to the bias-induced modulation of the interface barrier, both in height and width, at the Pt/Nd:STO interface, which is caused by carrier injection and trapping/detrapping process on the Pt/Nd:STO interface. The results establish a strong connection between the RS/PV effects and the modulation of the Nd:STO interface triggered by applied electric field and provide a new route by using Voc for non-destructively sensing multiple non-volatile memory states.|$|R

40|$|Thermally induced {{recovery}} of nanoindents in a CUAINi single <b>crystal</b> shape <b>memory</b> alloy was studied by nanoindentation {{in conjunction with}} a heating stage. Nanoindents formed by a Berkovich indenter at room temperature were heated to 40, 70 and 100 degrees C. Partial recovery was observed for the nanoindents. The recovery ratio depended on the heating temperature. Indentation of CuAlNi can induce inelastic deformation via dislocation motion and a stress-induced matensitic transformation. The percentages of dislocation-induced plastic strain would affect the thermal deformation of CuAlNi, because the induced dislocations could stabilize stress-induced martensite plates even when the temperature above austenite finish temperature, A(f). When the applied indentation load is low (less than 10, 000 mu N), the shape recovery strain is predominant, compared with the dislocation-induced plastic strain. Therefore, the degree of indent recovery in the depth direction, delta(D), is high (about 0. 7 - 0. 8 at 100 degrees C). (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Although vast numbers of photochromic molecules have been so far reported, photochromic molecules which exhibit thermally irreversible photochromic reactivity are limited to a few examples. The thermal irreversibility is an indispensable property for the application of photochromic molecules to optical memories and switches. We have developed a new class of photochromic molecules named “diarylethenes”, which show the thermally irreversible photochromic reactivity. The well designed diarylethene derivatives provide outstanding photochromic performance: both isomers are thermally stable for more than 470, 000 years, photoinduced coloration/decoloration can be repeated more than 105 cycles, the quantum yield of cyclization reaction is close to 1 (100 %), and the response times of both coloration and decoloration are less than 10 ps.

Two alloys, one in austenitic (alloy A) and the other in martensitic (alloyM) condition in the as-grown state at room temperature, were examined.

With aging, successive martensitic transitions (β'_ 1 →γ' _ 1) in both the alloys and precipitate formation (γ _ 2) in the alloy A occur. Compression loading of the aged samples shows large mechanical hysteresis and stabilization of γ' _ 1 martensite which results in permanent strain after unloading. In addition, a noticeable increase in critical stress for transformation in the aged samples vis-`a-vis the as-quenched sample is seen. In tension, low temperature aged (473 K) samples show an increase in the critical stress for transformation in alloyM.
