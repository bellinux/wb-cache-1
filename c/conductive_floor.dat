40|$|Immunity {{tests to}} {{radiated}} electromagnetic field {{are one of}} the most common tests performed within the framework of the electromagnetic compatibility. These tests are performed inside a shielded chamber provided the requirements given by the appropriate standards are kept. As the levels of the generated fields can be high and the output power of the transmitting amplifiers cannot be infinite, it is necessary to achieve a good performance of the transmitting antenna. By means of the real experiment the author of this paper shows how the height of the antenna placed above the <b>conductive</b> <b>floor</b> can affect the antenna’s voltage standing waves ratio and how this phenomenon affects the parameters of the whole measurement system. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

40|$|The {{presence}} of an external time varying magnetic field in a conductive loop, creates induction voltage. If the loop is closed, current will flow. Many fittings of contemporary electrical engineering are based on this phenomenon. However, undesirable results seem to appear in some cases. Such cases are the parasitic currents in perimetrical grounds and conductive floors in medical and intensive care units. Limitation of those parasitic currents is imposed due to the {{presence of}} patients but also of high sensitivity devices in these room areas. In this work the creation of parasitic currents in perimetrical grounds and <b>conductive</b> <b>floor</b> is described and also a way to restrict them by using Bithreaded winding (double wounded wire) is suggested. Lastly the use of Bithreaded winding is examined as a way to restrict undesirable magnetic fields in other devices...|$|E
50|$|ESD {{prevention}} {{within an}} EPA may include using appropriate ESD-safe packing material, {{the use of}} conductive filaments on garments worn by assembly workers, conducting wrist straps and foot-straps to prevent high voltages from accumulating on workers' bodies, anti-static mats or <b>conductive</b> <b>flooring</b> materials to conduct harmful electric charges away from the work area, and humidity control. Humid conditions prevent electrostatic charge generation because the thin layer of moisture that accumulates on most surfaces serves to dissipate electric charges.|$|R
40|$|All {{technical}} {{literature of}} recent {{date on the}} subject of <b>conductive</b> <b>flooring</b> has cautioned against the use of waxes because a wax film is generally considered as an insulator. This limitation placed certain types of flooring materials at a considerable disadvantage, because the resilient floor coverings such as linoleum and rubber require the application of wax to preserve the surface in a state of acceptable appearance after a number of years of service.

5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "radiant heat", {{underfloor}} heating uses {{a network of}} pipes, tubing or heating cables, buried in or attached beneath a floor to allow heat to rise into the room. Best results are had with <b>conductive</b> <b>flooring</b> materials such as tile. The large surface area of such room-sized radiators allows them to be kept just a few degrees above desired room temperature, minimizing convection. Underfloor heating is more expensive in new construction than less efficient systems. It also is generally difficult to retrofit into existing buildings.|$|R
40|$|Measuring {{the complex}} {{permittivity}} of planetary surfaces provides insigth into their chemical composition and physical state. This {{can be done}} using a Mutual Impedance (MI) which consists in a four-electrode array generally (but not necessarily) {{in contact with the}} ground, working at a fixed frequency in the ELF-VLF (Extremely Low Frequency-Very Low Frequency) range with a dedicated electronic system [1]. The Permittivity Probe (PP) as part of the SESAME experiment onboard of the Philae/ROSETTA cometary lander relies on the MI concept. However the PP design had to be accomadated to the severe constraints of the Rosetta mission. In particular, parts of the landing gear (LG) and of other instruments are used as electrodes, introducing influences on the measurements to that need to be considered. Unfortunately, as {{it was not possible to}} perform it before launch, the calibration of the full system remains to be done. In order to prepare the analysis of PP data, a reduced size mockup of the LG built in DLR (Cologne, Germany) as well as a mockup-in-size of the instrument including a setup for Philae conductive body have been used for calibration tests in LATMOS (Guyancourt, France). Two configurations have been tested: i) tests as the instrument is in open space, as far as possible from walls, ceiling and floor, ii) Tests as the instrument is placed at several heights from a <b>conductive</b> <b>floor.</b> Such configurations aim at reproducing PP operations during the descent to the comet and the phase of first ground measurements. This would provide, together with numerical simulations under COMSOL™ a full model of the PP-SESAME instrument on Philae for the descent and first ground measurements configuration. Then slight corrections to this model would be possible using the in-flight calibration data to receive from the flight model during the descent on the comet. In this paper, we will present and discuss the results obtained with both nominal and reduced-in-size LGs in free space and in the vicinity of a conductive target (water). Such experiments and numerical simulations have never been done before and are crucial for understanding PP measurements. They also offer a unique opportunity to demonstrate the scientific interest of permittivity probes as it is anticipated that similar experiments will be proposed for future planetary missions including a lander or a rover.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the properties of different <b>conductive</b> <b>flooring</b> materials belonging to one class is presented. There {{is a possibility that}} the properties of at least some of these flooring materials may vary with the subfloor on which they are laid. The group of materials which rate high in the desirable properties from the standpoint of appearance and durability, rate low in the properties relating to comfort. The reverse is true {{in the case of the}} group of materials which rate high in comfort. It may be suggested that comfort is an important consideration when selecting flooring materials. When a decision is taken to install a non-resilient type of flooring, which rates low in comfort, consideration should always be given to the type of footwear which will be used since it should be possible to attain the desirable degree of comfort by the proper selection of shoes.

2500|$|For {{many years}} it was assumed that, due to their design and gliding motion, Daleks were unable to climb stairs, {{and that this was}} a simple way of {{escaping}} them. A well-known cartoon from Punch pictured a group of Daleks {{at the foot of a}} flight of stairs with the caption, [...] "Well, this certainly buggers our plan to conquer the Universe". In a scene from the serial Destiny of the Daleks, the Doctor and companions escape from Dalek pursuers by climbing into a ceiling duct. The Fourth Doctor calls down, [...] "If you're supposed to be the superior race of the universe, why don't you try climbing after us?" [...] The Daleks generally make up for their lack of mobility with overwhelming firepower; a joke among Doctor Who fans goes, [...] "Real Daleks don't climb stairs; they level the building." [...] Dalek mobility has improved over the history of the series: in their first appearance, The Daleks, they were capable of movement only on the <b>conductive</b> metal <b>floors</b> of their city; in The Dalek Invasion of Earth a Dalek emerges from the waters of the River Thames, indicating that they not only had become freely mobile, but are amphibious; Planet of the Daleks showed that they could ascend a vertical shaft by means of an external anti-gravity mat placed on the floor; Revelation of the Daleks showed Davros in his life-support chair and one of his Daleks hovering and Remembrance of the Daleks depicted them as capable of hovering up a flight of stairs. Despite this, journalists covering the series frequently refer to the Daleks' supposed inability to climb stairs; characters escaping up a flight of stairs in the 2005 episode [...] "Dalek" [...] made the same joke, and were shocked when the Dalek began to hover up the stairs after uttering the phrase [...] "ELEVATE", in a similar manner to their normal phrase [...] "EXTERMINATE". The new series depicts the Daleks as fully capable of flight, even space flight.|$|R
