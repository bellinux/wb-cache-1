5|$|Reagan {{never left}} the United States during the war, but he kept a film reel that he {{obtained}} {{while he was in}} the service. The reel depicted the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp; he believed that doubts would someday arise as to whether the Holocaust had occurred. It has been alleged that he was overheard telling Israeli foreign minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1983 that he had filmed that footage himself and helped liberate Auschwitz, though this purported <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> disputed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.|$|E
5|$|The {{recorded}} <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> {{a critical}} aspect of Jackson's {{defense against the}} upcoming allegation made against him. He and his supporters argue {{that he was the}} victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money from the singer. In October 1994, Mary A. Fischer of GQ magazine reported it was Evan Chandler who initially accused Jackson of molesting his son, before he demanded a screenwriting deal from Jackson instead of going to the police.|$|E
5|$|In October 1995, Sirivudh {{talked about}} his desire to assassinate Hun Sen during an {{interview}} with So Naro, who was the secretary-general of the Khmer Journalists Association. A few days later Ung Phan, a FUNCINPEC minister who had close ties with Hun Sen, called Sirivudh and accused him of getting involved in receiving kickbacks for printing Cambodian passports. Sirivudh angrily denied the accusations and threatened to kill Hun Sen over the phone. The phone <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> recorded, and Ung Phan passed the recorded phone conversation to CPP co-minister of the interior Sar Kheng. Hun Sen learnt of the conversation and became enraged at Sirivudh's comments, and pressured Ranariddh and other FUNCINPEC ministers to strip his parliamentary immunity {{so that he could}} be arrested. Sirivudh was arrested and briefly placed in detention, but subsequently exiled to France when Sihanouk intervened in the case.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the primary}} tools of {{collective}} intelligence <b>is</b> <b>conversation.</b> Conversation takes many forms, from interactive storytelling, to an emerging lingua franca of structured conversation, Issue-based information systems (IBIS) and related forms of contested discourse. Conversation federation facilitates improved collective intelligence for sensemaking and for decision making. Federating <b>conversations</b> <b>is</b> performed through topic mapping processes where <b>conversations</b> <b>are</b> organized around the subjects they entail. While each <b>conversation</b> <b>is,</b> itself, a subject, each <b>conversation</b> <b>is</b> about one or more subjects. Structured conversations created in IBIS settings are typically rooted in a central topic or central question (issue). Where <b>conversations</b> <b>are</b> about the same topic or issue, they federate—that is, they are combined through a topic mapping merge process that maintains a well-organized map of the combined conversations. A goal that animates collective intelligence is collective wisdom; making wise decisions. We describe a platform aimed to serve such a goal...|$|R

5|$|Twenty-four {{hours after}} his arrest, King {{was allowed to}} see local {{attorneys}} from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home {{after the birth of}} their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.|$|E
5|$|Late on 28 November 1980, {{the night}} before the team's {{departure}} for Italy, goalkeeper Józef Młynarczyk and forward Włodzimierz Smolarek, both of Widzew Łódź, left the team hotel in Warsaw, the Hotel Vera, without permission. According to Smolarek they did this to get some dinner because they did not like the food at the hotel. They met a friend of Młynarczyk's, sports journalist Wojciech Zieliński, at the Adria nightclub. According to Andrzej Iwan, another member of the team, the main topic of <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> Zieliński's estranged wife, who had been caught prostituting herself around Warsaw, and had since moved to Italy. Several Poland players knew her, and Młynarczyk had just been to Italy to play for Widzew Łódź against Juventus. According to Iwan, the journalist encouraged Młynarczyk to drink as they talked, hoping the goalkeeper might have news of her. Smolarek left the club around 02:00, but Młynarczyk and Zieliński stayed until about three hours later.|$|E
5|$|Pregame media {{coverage}} of the 2011 Orange Bowl focused on {{the manner in which the}} two teams involved had reversed their fortunes during the 2010 college football season. Stanford had its longest winning streak since 1991 its most wins in history, and was four years removed from a one-win season, while Virginia Tech became the first team in college football history to win 11 consecutive games in a season after losing its first two. The two teams had never played each other, but they shared a common 2010 opponent, Wake Forest. Before the Orange Bowl, Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said he didn't see much difference in quality. Another point of <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> the poor performance of the ACC in nonconference games and Virginia Tech's poor past performance against teams ranked in the top 5. The Hokies had won just one of 27 games against teams in that category. Partially because of this factor, spread bettors favored Stanford by three points when the first odds were released December 10, a margin that various organizations either kept constant or raised to 3.5 points by the day of the game. It was the first time all season the Hokies were point spread underdogs.|$|E
50|$|Playful {{and happy}} <b>conversation</b> <b>is</b> {{the main focus}} of {{activity}} in third places, although it is not required to be the only activity. The tone of <b>conversation</b> <b>is</b> usually light hearted and humorous; wit and good natured playfulness are highly valued.|$|R
25|$|The {{foundation}} of this theory is {{the concepts of}} text and <b>conversation.</b> Text <b>is</b> defined as the content of interaction, or what is said in an interaction. Text is the meaning made available to individuals through a face-to-face or electronic mode of communication. <b>Conversation</b> <b>is</b> defined as what is happening behaviorally between two or more participants in the communication process. <b>Conversation</b> <b>is</b> the exchange or interaction itself.|$|R
40|$|An online <b>conversation</b> <b>is</b> {{not very}} {{different}} from the <b>conversations</b> people have <b>been</b> having for thousands of years. Topics are introduced, ideas are shared, and sometimes enlightenment is forthcoming. The difference <b>is</b> that these <b>conversations</b> <b>are</b> sometimes recorded and archived for future use. The knowledge that is created and shared in <b>conversations</b> can therefore <b>be</b> preserved and later accessed by people who did not participate in the original discussion. Another difference is that many non-verbal cues that we are used to interpreting in faceto-face <b>conversations</b> <b>are</b> missing. Contextual information about where <b>conversation</b> partners <b>are</b> located and what they are doing is also reduced. Consequently, the knowledge that we exchange via online textual <b>conversations</b> <b>is</b> primarily explicit; tacit knowledge tends to be thin if present at all. Examples of &quot;on-line conversations &quot; include personal electronic mail, mailing lists, instant messaging (IM), Short Message Service (SMS) notes, chat rooms, Usenet newsgroups, threaded Web-based discussion lists, and massive multi-player on-line role playing games (MMORPG).

25|$|Lesage lived beyond 80 {{years of}} age, but was afflicted with {{deafness}} {{and had to}} use an ear trumpet. However, his <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> so delightful that when he ventured {{into the world and}} frequented his favourite coffee house in Rue St. Jacques in Paris, guests would gather around him, climbing onto tables and chairs, to hear his famous words of wit and wisdom.|$|E
25|$|James Boswell who was {{a student}} of Smith's at Glasgow University, and later knew him at the Literary Club, says that Smith thought that {{speaking}} about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books, and so his <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> unimpressive. According to Boswell, he once told Sir Joshua Reynolds that 'he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood'.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{completion}} of the bypass, the A34 and A4 met in the town centre at Robin Hood Roundabout, a complicated gyratory system encompassing 6 approaching roads, a fire station, ambulance station and an exit {{on the inside of the}} roundabout, which has a north-south flyover across the roundabout. In 2007, the sculpture Couple in <b>Conversation</b> <b>was</b> unveiled on the roundabout, providing a new landmark for one of the major gateways into the town.|$|E

25|$|The easy life he {{had spoken}} of to Northcote had largely {{vanished}} {{by the time that}} <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> published about a year before his death. By then he was overwhelmed by the degradation of poverty, frequent bouts of physical as well as mental illness—depression caused by his failure to find true love and by his inability to bring to fruition his defence of the man he worshipped as a hero of liberty and fighter of despotism.|$|E
25|$|Events came to {{a climax}} during Baldetti's legal hearing. An intercepted phone <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> played in which one could {{hear the voice of}} President Perez Molina asking the SAT {{director}} for personnel changes, allegedly to accommodate the smuggling network. A national strike was called after the release of that conversation. In the end, on September 1, Otto Pérez Molina was impeached and stripped of his immunity; he resigned September 2 and was in custody on the 3rd.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, the Tehelka {{magazine}} {{published an}} exposé that {{revealed that the}} CBI has in its possession an audio recording of a conversation between Gujarat's former Minister of State Praful Patel, senior IAS officer G C Murmu, and other top officials in a meeting called to chalk out a plan to safeguard {{the interests of the}} officers whose names could crop up in the investigation. The <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> secretly recorded by a meeting attendee, Girish Laxman Singhal, one of the two accused police officers who have been arrested by the CBI in the case.|$|E

50|$|A fishbowl <b>conversation</b> <b>is</b> {{a form of}} dialog {{that can}} be used when {{discussing}} topics within large groups. Fishbowl <b>conversations</b> <b>are</b> sometimes also used in participatory events such as Unconferences. The advantage of Fishbowl is that it allows the entire group to participate in a conversation. Several people can join the discussion.|$|R
50|$|Conversations follow {{rules of}} {{etiquette}} because <b>conversations</b> <b>are</b> social interactions, and therefore depend on social convention. Specific rules for conversation {{arise from the}} cooperative principle. Failure to adhere to these rules causes the conversation to deteriorate or eventually to end. Contributions to a <b>conversation</b> <b>are</b> responses to what has previously been said.|$|R
25|$|In various NFL Films {{productions}} {{about the}} play years later, various Raiders have theorized {{that the real}} purpose of Swearingen's phone <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> {{to see if there}} were enough police on hand to ensure the players' safety if the play was ruled incomplete, and was then called in the Steelers' favor out of fear, Swearingen was told when asking how many police officers were present that there were only six policemen, so he calls for six points and a touchdown. In one of them, McNally laughs at the suggestion.|$|E
25|$|In common-law countries, {{adultery}} {{was also}} known as criminal conversation. This became {{the name of the}} civil tort arising from adultery, being based upon compensation for the other spouse's injury. Criminal <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> usually referred to by lawyers as crim. con., and was abolished in England in 1857, and the Republic of Ireland in 1976. Another tort, alienation of affection, arises when one spouse deserts the other for a third person. This act was {{also known as}} desertion, which was often a crime as well. A small number of jurisdictions still allow suits for criminal conversation and/or alienation of affection. In the United States, six states still maintain this tort.|$|E
25|$|Scandal {{erupted in}} June 1995 when a {{recording}} of a 1990 telephone conversation between Johnson and his friend Darius Guppy was made public. In the conversation, Guppy revealed that his criminal activities were being investigated by News of the World journalist Stuart Collier, and he asked Johnson to provide him with Collier's private address, seeking to have the latter beaten up. Johnson agreed to supply the information although he expressed concern {{that he would be}} associated with the attack. When the phone <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> published in 1995, Johnson insisted that he did not ultimately give the information to Guppy; Hastings reprimanded Johnson's behaviour but did not sack him.|$|E

25|$|Despite Genie's {{increased}} willingness {{and ability}} to engage in conversation she continued to speak far less than most people in equivalent phases of language acquisition, and her conversational competence remained very low. In her dissertation, Curtiss wrote that in many aspects Genie's overall demeanor continued to bear a strong resemblance {{to that of a}} person who had not been socialized. The scientists found Genie's inability to master conversational skills was unsurprising and suggested that the ability to engage in <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> a separate skill from simply knowing language, consistent with earlier observations of retarded and autistic children. They therefore attributed Genie's difficulty with conversation to her lack of socialization during childhood instead of her language constraints.|$|E
25|$|Having {{lived for}} years in the Connecticut town of Westport, near New York City, Ralph G. Martin moved to the Kendal on Hudson {{retirement}} community in another of the city's suburbs, Sleepy Hollow, where he died seven-and-a-half weeks before his 93rd birthday. He and his wife Marjorie were the parents of two daughters and a son. Upon publication of Seeds of Destruction: Joe Kennedy and His Sons, he was invited for an hour-long conversation with Charlie Rose, broadcast December 8, 1995 on Rose's long-running TV interview program. A clip from the <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> included on Rose's year-end show in memoriam of 35 guests on his programs, between 1991 and 2009, who died in 2013.|$|E
25|$|The eldest male at {{the table}} was always served first, {{commonly}} served {{to them in the}} men's quarters by the women of the house. Women usually dined in a separate portion of the house after the men were served. The eldest men or women always ate before the younger family members. The meal was usually quiet, as <b>conversation</b> <b>was</b> discouraged during meals. In modern times, these rules have become lax, as families usually dine together now and use the time to converse. Of the remaining elements of this decorum, one is that the younger members of the table should not pick up their chopsticks or start eating before the elders of the table or guests and should not finish eating before the elders or guests finish eating.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the same}} New York Times article Robert M. Greenberg then {{states that he}} wants to [...] "engage (consumers) in digital <b>conversations</b> that <b>are</b> so entertaining, {{involving}} and valuable that they wont want to ignore them." [...] The key word here is [...] "engage". Digital <b>Conversations</b> <b>are</b> created to be, in essence, human interactions and dialogue with one human removed. Unlike Bots and Avatars, Digital <b>Conversations</b> <b>are</b> scripted, and this may well lead to more human like interactions.|$|R
