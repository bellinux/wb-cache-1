To these, Roland Graeme was of course an object of envy, and, in consequence, of dislike and detraction; but the youth possessed qualities which {{it was impossible to}} depreciate. Pride, and a sense of early ambition, did for him what severity and <b>constant</b> <b>instruction</b> did for others. In truth, the youthful Roland displayed that early flexibility both of body and mind, which renders exercise, either mental or bodily, rather matter of sport than of study; and it seemed as if he acquired accidentally, and by starts, those accomplishments, which earnest and <b>constant</b> <b>instruction,</b> enforced by frequent reproof and occasional chastisement, had taught to others. Such military exercises, such lessons of the period, as he found it agreeable or convenient to apply to, he learned so perfectly, as to confound those who were ignorant how often the want of constant application is compensated by vivacity of talent and ardent enthusiasm. The lads, therefore, who were more regularly trained to arms, to horsemanship, and to other necessary exercises of the period, while they envied Roland Graeme the indulgence or negligence with which he seemed to be treated, had little reason to boast of their own superior acquirements; a few hours, with the powerful exertion of a most energetic will, seemed to do for him more than the regular instruction of weeks could accomplish for others.|$|E

In due time he found out that no word the chief had {{addressed}} him was idly spoken, and he began to live the life of the savages like one of themselves, under the affectionate care and <b>constant</b> <b>instruction</b> of his brethren. He was given a gun, at first, and sent to hunt turkeys, but he came upon the trace of buffalo, and was lured on by the hope of larger game, and so lost his way. The Indians found him again easily enough, but as a punishment for his rashness his gun was taken from him, and for two years he was allowed to carry only a bow and arrows. Once when the hunters had killed a bear and he went out with a party to bring in the meat, Smith complained of the weight of his load; the Indians laughed at him, and to shame him they gave part of his burden to a young squaw who already had as much as he to carry. At another time, he went to the fields with some other young men to watch the squaws hoeing corn; one of these challenged him to take her hoe, and he did so, and hoed for some time with the women. They were delighted and praised his skill, but when he came back to the village, the old chiefs rebuked him, telling him that he was adopted in the place of a great man, and it was unworthy of him to hoe corn like a squaw.|$|E
60|$|Altogether, Ernest did {{not enjoy}} his first week at the Exmoors'. Nor did he enjoy the second, or the third, or the fourth week much better. The society was profoundly distasteful to him: the world was not his world, nor the talk his talk; and he grew so sick of the {{perpetual}} discussion of horses, dogs, pheasants, dances, and lawn tennis, with occasional digressions on Giulio Clovio and the Connemara gallery, that he found even a chat with Lady Hilda (who knew and cared for nothing, but liked to chat with {{him because he was}} 'so original') a pleasant relief, by comparison, from the eternal round of Lord Exmoor's anecdotes about famous racers or celebrated actresses. But worst of all he did not like his work; he felt that, useless as he considered it, he was not successfully performing even the useless function he was paid to fulfil. Lynmouth couldn't learn, wouldn't learn, and wasn't going to learn. Ernest might as well have tried to din the necessary three plays of Euripides into the nearest lamp-post. Nobody encouraged him to learn in any way, indeed Lord Exmoor remembered that he himself had scraped through somehow at Christ Church, {{with the aid of a}} private tutor and the magic of his title, and he hadn't the least doubt that Lynmouth would scrape through in his turn in like manner. And so, though most young men would have found the Dunbude tutorship the very acme of their wishes--plenty of amusements and nothing to do for them--Ernest Le Breton found it to the last degree irksome and unsatisfactory. Not that he had ever to complain of any unkindliness on the part of the Exmoor family; they were really in their own way very kind-hearted, friendly sort of people--that is to say, towards all members of their own circle; and as they considered Ernest one of themselves, in virtue of their acquaintance with his mother, they really did their best to make him as happy and comfortable as was in their power. But then he was such a very strange young man! 'For what on earth can you do,' as Lord Exmoor justly asked, 'with a young fellow who won't shoot, and who won't fish, and who won't hunt, and who won't even play lansquenet?' Such a case was clearly hopeless. He would have liked to see more of Miss Merivale, little Lady Sybil's governess (for there were three children in the family); but Miss Merivale was a timid, sensitive girl, and she did not often encourage his advances, lest my lady should say she was setting her cap at the tutor. The consequence was that he was necessarily thrown much upon Lady Hilda's society; and as Lady Hilda was laudably eager to instruct him in billiards, lawn tennis, and sketching, he rapidly grew to be quite an adept at those relatively moral and innocuous amusements, under her <b>constant</b> <b>instruction</b> and supervision.|$|E

40|$|Rehabilitation {{of major}} resections {{of the tongue}} has always posed a serious problem. This paper {{presents}} the feasibility and rationale of rehabilitating partial glossectomies {{by the use of}} the pectoralis major myocutaneous fl ap and the fabrication of a “new tongue ” by the use of this fl ap. The criteria for these techniques in benign and malignant tumors of the tongue are outlined. The segmental innervation of the pectoralis major muscle from a variety of three to fi ve nerve branches permits the development of a skin-muscle fl ap that may be transposed with its nerve supply intact or totally denervated, depending upon the status of the hypoglossal nerves and tongue in the operative fi eld. This presents the possibility of transposing a skin-muscle fl ap into a glossal wound with a completely intact nerve supply where the new fl ap is under <b>constant</b> <b>instruction</b> in its new physiologic environ-ment. It also presents the possibility of neurotization of the denervated section of the muscle fl ap by axones from the intact segment of tongue. A third possibility is the fabrication of a “new tongue ” by the transfer of the hypo glossal nerves into the denervated segment of the peripheral aspect of the myocutaneous fl ap. This variety and combi-nation of rehabilitative techniques introduces a new phase into the rehabilitation of the tongue The tounge is the most essential organ in the oral cavity. It is re-sponsible for moving the blous for food or liquid through the oral cavity into the mesopharynx. It assists in molding and beautify-ing the human voice.

Although the tounge has an astounding capaci-ty for adaption after injury or resection, there are well-recognized circumstances that may cause severe crippling.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new {{analysis}} of the well-known family of multiplicative hash functions, and improved deterministic algorithms for selecting “good ” hash functions. The main motivation is realization of deterministic dictionaries with fast lookups and reasonably fast updates. The model of computation is the Word RAM, and {{it is assumed that}} the machine word size matches the size of keys in bits. Many of the modern solutions to the dictionary problem are weakly non-uniform, i. e. they require a number of constants to be computed at “compile time ” for stated time bounds to hold. The currently fastest deterministic dictionary uses constants not known to be computable in polynomial time. In contrast, our dictionaries do not require any special <b>constants</b> or <b>instructions,</b> and running times are independent of the word (and key) length. Our family of dynamic dictionaries achieves a performance of the following type: lookups in time O(t) and updates in amortized time O(n 1 /t), for an appropriate parameter function t. Update procedures require division, whereas searching uses multiplication only. ...|$|R

Hence, limiting the computational cost of the classifier is equivalent to limiting the number of features used for classification.

Our compile-time technique allows static linking of memo-ization code and this increases the benefit due to memoization by leveraging the inlining capability for the memoization wrapper.
