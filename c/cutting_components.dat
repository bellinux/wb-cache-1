40|$|The article {{considers}} {{development of}} a modernized UDM- 600 dynamometer-based setup for measuring the <b>cutting</b> force <b>components.</b> Modernization of existing equipment to improve the method of recording the <b>cutting</b> force <b>components</b> in the automated mode is of relevance. The measuring setup allows recording the <b>cutting</b> force <b>components</b> in turning and milling, {{as well as the}} axial force and the torque in the drilling and milling operations. The article presents a block diagram and a schematic diagram of the setup to measure the <b>cutting</b> force <b>components,</b> and describes a basic principle of measuring units within the modernized setup. The developed setup uses a half-bridge strain gauge measuring circuit to record the cutting forces. To enhance the measuring circuit output voltage is used a 16 -channel amplifier of LA-UN 16 model with a discretely adjustable gain. To record and process electrical signals is used a data acquisition device of NI USB- 6009 model, which enables transmitting the received data to a PC via USB-interface. The data acquisition device has a built-in stabilized DC power supply that is used to power the strain gauge bridges. A developed schematic diagram of the measuring setup allows us to realize this measuring device and implement its modernization. Final processing of recorded data is provided through the software developed in visual programming environment LabVIEW 9. 0. The program allows us to show the real-time measuring values of the <b>cutting</b> force <b>components</b> graphically and to record the taken data to a text file.

This new type alloy is used as the manufacture of different aerospace and aero-engine structural parts. Titanium alloys, however, are generally machined at cutting speeds over 60 m/min with cemented carbide tools due to its low thermal conductivity and high chemical reactivity with cutting tool materials. The effects of the parameters of the process, i. e. cutting speed, tooth feed, depth of radial cut, and depth of axial cut, on cutting forces were studied in this paper. Cutting Forces in high speed milling with cemented carbides were measured using highly sensitive dynamometer. The tool wear was measured in an off-line manner and the relationships between peak cutting forces and tool wear magnitude were constructed.

The workpiece material, hardened alloy steel AISI 52100, was machined on a CNC lathe with coated carbide tool under different settings of cutting parameters. Three cutting parameters each at three levels were considered in the study. Central composite design (CCD) of experiment was used to collect experimental data for <b>cutting</b> force <b>components</b> and MRR. The results were analyzed using an effective procedure of response surface methodology (RSM) to determine optimal values of cutting parameters. Statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine significance of the cutting parameters. Several diagnostic tests were also performed to check the validity of assumptions. The results indicate that <b>cutting</b> force <b>components</b> are influenced principally by the depth of cut, while {{the effect of}} both cutting speed and feed rate is small.

Such drawings are constructed by {{a framework of}} algorithms which operates in four phases: cycle removal, leveling, crossing reduction, and coordinate assignment. However, there are situations where cycles should be displayed as such, e. g., distinguished cycles in the biosciences and scheduling processes repeating in a daily or weekly turn.

However, {{it had not been}} investigated. In this paper we complete the cyclic approach and investigate the coordinate assignment phase. The leveling and the crossing reduction for recurrent hierarchies have been studied in the companion papers [3, 4]. We provide an algorithm which runs in linear time and constructs an intermediate drawing with at most two bends per edge and aligned edge segments in an area of quadratic width times the preset number of levels height.

The quality parameters utilised for Acceptable / Not Acceptable process conditions classification were the vibration level during machining {{and the type of}} chip generated ranked between 1 (good) and 5 (bad) on the basis of expert turning operator knowledge.

40|$|Signal {{processing}} using orthogonal <b>cutting</b> force <b>components</b> for tool {{condition monitoring}} has established itself in literature. In {{the application of}} single axis strain sensors however a linear combination of <b>cutting</b> force <b>components</b> has to be processed in order to monitor tool wear. This situation may arise when a single axis piezoelectric actuator is simultaneously used as an actuator and a sensor, e. g. its vibration control feedback signal exploited for monitoring purposes.

Reconstruction of the dynamic force acting at the tool tip from signals obtained during measurements using a strain gauge instrumented tool holder in a turning process is described. An application of this dynamic force signal was simulated on a filter-model of that tool holder thatwould carry a self-sensing actuator. For comparison of the orthogonal and unidirectional force component tool wear monitoring strategies the same time-delay neural network structure has been applied. Wearsensitive features are determined by wavelet packet analysis to provide information for tool wear estimation. The probability of a difference less than 5 percentage points between the flank wear estimation errors of above mentioned two processing strategies is at least 95 %.

The machinabilty of hybrid composites becomes vital for manufacturing industries. The need to study the influence of process parameters on the cutting forces in turning such hybrid composite under dry environment is essentially required. In the present study, the influence of machining parameters, e. g. cutting speed, feed and depth of cut on the <b>cutting</b> force <b>components,</b> namely feed force (Ff), cutting force (Fc), and radial force (Fd) has been investigated.
