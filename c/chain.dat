5|$|A Markov <b>chain</b> {{is a type}} of Markov {{process that}} has either {{discrete}} state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov <b>chain</b> varies. For example, it is common to define a Markov <b>chain</b> as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also common to define a Markov <b>chain</b> as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their side <b>chain</b> into four groups. The side <b>chain</b> can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the side <b>chain</b> is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar. The chemical structures of the 22 standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E

5|$|Another set of officials, the <b>chain</b> crew, are {{responsible}} for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long <b>chain</b> between them, are used to measure for a first down. The <b>chain</b> crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical <b>chain</b> crew will have at least three people – {{two members of the}} <b>chain</b> crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The <b>chain</b> crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.|$|E

He invested an additional $50 million to refurbish outlets and $20 {{million on a}} new computer system to link outlet cash registers to the kitchen, drive-through window, manager's office and company headquarters. Cranor also expanded the <b>chain</b> into non-traditional locations, beginning with a 150 sq ft limited menu kiosk at a General Motors assembly plant in Dayton, Ohio. Between 1986 and 1991, the <b>chain</b> built a further 2,000 outlets to bring its total number to 8,500, and sales grew from $3.5 to $6.2 billion. The <b>chain</b> {{had to contend with}} the rise of grilled chicken as Americans became increasingly health conscious. KFC found itself competing against the growing El Pollo Loco restaurant <b>chain,</b> as well as with Burger King, which had just introduced the BK Broiler, a grilled chicken burger. Delays in product development, cramped kitchens and the ongoing franchisee contract dispute prevented the <b>chain</b> from rolling out a grilled product of its own.|$|E

50|$|Many {{of these}} lines {{originally}} had individual <b>chaining</b> zero points {{as a result}} of the different companies that built and operated them. The BRT consolidated the <b>chaining</b> system subsequent to taking over these and many lines were again rechained when they were shifted from elevated to subway lines. These <b>chaining</b> lines and zero locations are accurate as of c. 1900 for lines <b>chained</b> from Park Row; as they were opened c. 1915-1920 for lines <b>chained</b> from 57th Street; as of line openings for other lines.

5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} <b>Chain</b> Gauge, {{consisting}} of a percentage that increases from a base level of 100 when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Different attacks have different effects; some raise the <b>chain</b> by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the <b>Chain</b> Gauge resets to 100 percent. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the <b>chain</b> percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When the <b>chain</b> counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy becomes Staggered. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and is easily interrupted, and some may even be launched into the air, preventing them from attacking and stopping their ATB gauges from replenishing.|$|E

5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy <b>chain</b> part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each <b>chain.</b> The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single <b>chain</b> variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of the heavy and light <b>chain</b> via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy <b>chain</b> or the constant domain of the light <b>chain.</b> This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{simulate}} the nonlinear wave propagation in granular <b>chains</b> of beads using a recently introduced multiple impact model and to compare numerical results to experimental ones. Different kinds of granular <b>chains</b> are investigated: monodisperse <b>chains,</b> tapered <b>chains</b> and stepped <b>chains.</b> Particular attention is paid to the dispersion effect, and the wave propagation in tapered <b>chains,</b> the interaction of two solitary waves in monodisperse <b>chains,</b> and the formation of solitary wave trains in stepped <b>chains.</b> We show that the main features of the wave propagation observed experimentally in these granular <b>chains</b> are very well reproduced. This proves that the considered multiple impact model and numerical scheme are able to encapsulate the main physical effects that occur in such multibody systems...|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the crumbling social system outside their walls, the prison film portrayed a universe where the state was all powerful and orderly. Sparked by the Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930 in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions in prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the <b>chain</b> gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the <b>chain</b> gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconion system in the blazing outdoors where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors. The prototype of the prison genre was 1930's The Big House. 1932's I am a Fugitive from a <b>Chain</b> Gang is considered the seminal film of the <b>chain</b> gang genre. Although the <b>chain</b> gang film Hell's Highway had beaten Fugitive to the screen two months earlier, it exerted nowhere the influence.|$|E
5|$|In mammals {{there are}} two types of {{immunoglobulin}} light <b>chain,</b> which are called lambda (λ) and kappa (κ).

5|$|In mid-2000, SFI, {{the owner}} of the Litten Tree bar <b>chain,</b> {{announced}} a £31.6 million takeover of Slug and Lettuce, paid for in shares, and McKenzie left the <b>chain</b> in order to pursue new challenges. By this time the <b>chain</b> had 32 outlets. According to analysts, the <b>chain</b> was too small and had too much debt to survive alone. SFI refurbished a number of their existing pubs under the Slug and Lettuce concept, and by 2004 the <b>chain</b> had 56 outlets. In 2005, SFI attempted to reposition the <b>chain</b> as an upmarket place to eat, in anticipation of the forthcoming smoking ban. In June 2005 SFI went into administration, and sold 98 of its 150 outlets to the Laurel Pub Company, controlled by Robert Tchenguiz, for £80 million. In 2008 Laurel itself collapsed, and the Slug <b>chain</b> became a part of the Bay Restaurant Group, later Town & City Pub Company. The <b>chain</b> has withdrawn from a number of locations, including Glasgow and Cardiff, leaving it with only one location in Scotland, and no presence in Wales. In 2010, Town & City began to refurbish the outlets, switching from a brown colour scheme to aubergine and updating upholstery and lighting. In June 2011 Town & City merged with the Stonegate Pub Company.|$|E
