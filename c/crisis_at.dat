5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{defensive}} injury <b>crisis</b> <b>at</b> the club, Carrick started the 2012–13 season as a makeshift centre-back. His inexperience in the role was exploited by Everton in the season opener, as Marouane Fellaini beat him to a corner kick to score the only goal of the game. He continued in the role for the next match against Fulham. He scored his first goal of the season in a 1–0 Champions League victory against Galatasaray, after series of ball movement leading to Michael Carrick rounding the goalkeeper to score with his left foot. On 24 November 2012, Carrick was left out the squad that defeated QPR 3–1, ending his run of 33 consecutive league starts.|$|E

5|$|Saavedra {{settled in}} San Juan in 1814. He {{had a new}} son, Pedro Cornelio, and {{maintained}} a simple life growing grapes. He awaited the final decision of Posadas, but the supreme director had a political <b>crisis</b> <b>at</b> the time. The Spanish king Ferdinand VII {{had returned to the}} throne and demanded the colonies to return to their former organization, the royalists at Upper Peru were still a threat, and José Gervasio Artigas opposed Buenos Aires as well, because of its high centralism. As a result, Carlos María de Alvear became the new supreme director, who would decide the final fate of Cornelio Saavedra.|$|E

5|$|Alex Parrish, {{a former}} FBI recruit, becomes a prime suspect after a {{terrorist}} attack on Grand Central Terminal and is arrested for treason. In flashbacks, she and her fellow agents (each with their own reason for joining the bureau) train at the FBI Academy. The current time-line focuses on Parrish's constrained relationship with her friends while {{she is on the}} run in an attempt to prove her innocence. In the second season, Parrish has apparently been fired by the FBI; in flashbacks, she works undercover for the FBI as a CIA recruit to uncover the AIC, a rogue faction within the agency. In the current time-line, a hostage <b>crisis</b> <b>at</b> a G-20 summit in New York City is initiated by the Citizens Liberation Front, a terrorist group. Two weeks after the crisis, President Claire Haas and CIA director Matthew Keyes form a covert CIA-FBI task force (led by Clay Haas) to expose eight conspirators who were secretly involved in the hostage crisis.|$|E
5|$|Comminges {{had played}} youth {{football}} {{in his native}} Guadeloupe for local side Rapid Club Petit-Canal before moving to France in 1997. After a successful spell on trial, he joined the youth academy at Amiens SC {{at the age of}} 15, breaking into the first-team in 2002. Although naturally right-footed, Comminges' first experience in the Amiens first-team came as a left sided player as manager Denis Troch was forced to utilise him in an unfamiliar position following an injury <b>crisis</b> <b>at</b> the club. During the 2002–03 season, he made 14 league appearances as Amiens finished in a mid-table position, despite only being on an amateur contract at the club. He left the club in May 2003, and joined Stade Reims of Championnat National, the third division of the French football league system, on a free transfer. In his first season with the club, he helped the side earn promotion to Ligue 2, with Reims finishing the season as champions. During his four years with the club, Comminges made 74 league appearances, with Reims establishing themselves in the second tier of French football.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{continued}} with his career. In March 1938 {{he was called}} to readiness with 604 Squadron during the Munich <b>crisis.</b> <b>At</b> this time the squadron was flying the Hawker Demon. He was displeased when they converted to the Bristol Blenheim. The machines were fitted with a tray of four 303 Browning machine guns to give forward-facing firepower. As a long-range fighter it was of dubious value. The German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 could, and would, expose the frailties of the aircraft which was originally intended as a bomber. However, Cunningham {{was told by the}} Air Ministry that it would be sufficient in the night fighter role, which is where they intended to use this variant. On 20 April 1938, John returned to de Havilland test-flying de Havilland Moth Minors.|$|E

5|$|In {{his second}} term, Nixon ordered an airlift to {{resupply}} Israeli {{losses in the}} Yom Kippur War, resulting in the restart of the Middle East peace process and an oil <b>crisis</b> <b>at</b> home. The Nixon administration supported a coup in Chile that ousted the government of Salvador Allende and propelled Augusto Pinochet to power. By late 1973, the Watergate scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support. On August 9, 1974, he resigned {{in the face of}} almost certain impeachment and removal from office. After his resignation, he was issued a pardon by his successor, Gerald Ford. In 20 years of retirement, Nixon wrote nine books and undertook many foreign trips, helping to rehabilitate his image into that of elder statesman. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994 and died four days later at the age of 81.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell reluctantly {{dropped his}} {{amalgamation}} plans, but retained his 19% stake in Reading. Under Smee's chairmanship, the team won promotion {{back from the}} Fourth Division {{at the end of}} the 1983–84 season, and won the Third Division title two years later, taking it into the Second Division. Smee remained at the helm until 1990, when amid a financial <b>crisis</b> <b>at</b> the club he sold it to John Madejski. Meanwhile, Maxwell made Oxford United profitable, and oversaw two successive promotions for the club during the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. The team played in the First Division, then the top level of English football, for the first time during 1985–86, and won its first major trophy, the League Cup, in April 1986. Despite Maxwell's reservations about the Manor Ground, the club remained there throughout this time.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, the WSB's {{spokesman}} {{stated that}} the remaining six members of the patrol, who had now been held for over a fortnight, would only be released after a new government was formed in Sierra Leone, leading negotiators {{to conclude that the}} increasingly unrealistic demands were stalling tactics rather than a serious attempt to conclude the <b>crisis.</b> <b>At</b> around the same time, teams that had been observing the West Side Boys' base for four days reported that they had seen no sign of the captive soldiers in that time. There were also concerns that an assault would become more dangerous if the West Side Boys moved the hostages. The combination of these factors led COBRA to order an extraction mission.|$|E

5|$|Stuart {{dropped down}} into non-League {{football}} with now defunct Hornchurch of the Conference South. He made fourteen {{appearances in the}} Conference South and seventeen in all competitions for Hornchurch, before a financial <b>crisis</b> <b>at</b> the club in November 2004 forced a number of players, including Stuart, to leave. He joined Grays Athletic, alongside Steve West and Lee Matthews, later being joined by former Hornchurch teammates Ashley Bayes, and John Martin. Stuart {{went on to win}} the Conference South and FA Trophy double with Grays that season, making 23 appearances in the league. The follow season, 2005–06 season, he made 34 appearances in the Conference National, reaching the play-offs finishing 3rd place, to be knocked out by Halifax Town 5–4 on aggregate. He also helped Grays Athletic retain the FA Trophy, defeating Woking 2–0 at Upton Park in the final.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 was {{launched}} on 5 March 1981 in two versions (though with identical components) – a pre-assembled machine or a cheaper kit version, which the user could assemble himself. Both versions were manufactured in Dundee, Scotland by Timex Corporation at the company's Dryburgh factory. Timex {{had not been}} an obvious choice of manufacturing subcontractor, as the company had little previous experience in assembling electronics. It was a well-established manufacturer of mechanical watches but was facing a <b>crisis</b> <b>at</b> {{the beginning of the}} 1980s. Profits had dwindled to virtually zero as the market for mechanical watches stagnated in the face of competition from the digital and quartz watches. Recognising the trend, Timex's director, Fred Olsen, determined that the company would diversify into other areas of business.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} <b>crisis</b> <b>at</b> {{the turn}} of the 20th century caused many aristocratic families to sell their paintings, but the British national collections were priced out of the market by American plutocrats. This prompted the foundation of the National Art Collections Fund, a society of subscribers dedicated to stemming the flow of artworks to the United States. Their first acquisition for the National Gallery was Velázquez's Rokeby Venus in 1906, followed by Holbein's Portrait of Christina of Denmark in 1909. However, despite the crisis in aristocratic fortunes, the following decade was one of several great bequests from private collectors. In 1909 the industrialist Dr Ludwig Mond gave 42 Italian renaissance paintings, including the Mond Crucifixion by Raphael, to the Gallery. Other bequests of note were those of George Salting in 1910, Austen Henry Layard in 1916 and Sir Hugh Lane in 1917; the last of these was one of the Gallery's more controversial bequests.|$|E

5|$|The three {{language}} formula was {{not strictly}} enforced either in South or Hindi-speaking areas. The changes to public services exams were impractical and not well received by government officials. The only real concession {{to the south}} was the assurance that the Official Languages Act would be modified. However, any effort {{to follow through with}} that pledge received stiff resistance. In April 1965, a meeting of a cabinet sub-committee comprising Gulzari lal Nanda, A. K. Sen, Satyanarayan Sinha, Mahavir Tyagi, M. C. Chagla and S. K. Patil and but no southern members debated the issue and could not come to any agreement. The sub-committee recommended the continuation of English and Hindi as joint link languages and was not in favour of either quota system or use of regional languages in public services exams. They drafted an amendment to Official Languages Act incorporating Nehru's assurances explicitly. This Bill guaranteeing the use of English in inter-state and state-Union communications as long as desired by Non-Hindi states was approved for discussion by the Speaker on 25 August. But it was withdrawn after a bitter debate citing inopportune time due to the ongoing Punjabi Suba movement and Kashmir <b>crisis</b> <b>at</b> that time.|$|E
5|$|No. 36 Squadron was {{particularly}} active during 2011. In January that year the squadron had to evacuate two C-17s from Amberley to Richmond when the base was threatened by rising floodwaters during the Queensland floods; {{of the other}} two Globemasters, one was in the Middle East and the other was undergoing maintenance and could not be flown. The aircraft stranded at Amberley was moved onto high ground during the <b>crisis</b> <b>at</b> the base and escaped without damage. The two Richmond-based C-17s subsequently flew over 227 tonnes of supplies to flood-affected regions of Queensland. When flooding also took place in Victoria during January, No. 36 Squadron transported 100,000 sandbags to Melbourne and flew Royal Australian Navy personnel and vehicles into the state from HMAS Albatross in New South Wales. No. 36 Squadron returned to Amberley after the flood waters dropped in mid-February. In early February the north Queensland city of Cairns was threatened by Cyclone Yasi, and the RAAF conducted two C-17 sorties and two C-130 sorties to evacuate patients from Cairns Base Hospital on the night of 1/2 February. After the cyclone passed over the Queensland coast, C-17s flew 200 tonnes of groceries into Cairns over a two-day period as part of Operation Yasi Assist. No. 36 Squadron also contributed aircraft to the Australian response to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in late February, the C-17s flying urban search and rescue teams into the city from the 23rd of the month and evacuating Australian citizens on their return flights.|$|E
