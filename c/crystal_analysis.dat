30|$|Many {{physical}} and chemical methods {{have been developed for}} the fabrication of nanoparticles. However, the chemicals used in these procedures leave toxic residues and pollute the environment. Therefore, biogenic synthesis of nanoparticles using fungi, bacteria, actinomycetes, algae, and higher plants have emerged as potential nanofactories which are cost effective and environment friendly [1 – 8]. The metal and metal oxide nanoparticles are widely used in agriculture, drug delivery, cosmetics, photonic <b>crystals,</b> <b>analysis,</b> food, coatings, paints, catalysis, and material science [1, 9 – 12].|$|R
