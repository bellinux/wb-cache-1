5000|$|While {{cancer cells}} are not protists per se, they exhibit several {{characteristics}} that {{are typical of}} these simple forms of life. In fact, cancer has been postulated to represents some sort of reversion to a more primitive phenotype - an atavism. In the atavistic model of cancer progression, tumor <b>cell</b> <b>dedifferentiation</b> is interpreted as a reversion to phylogenetically earlier capabilities. For example, cancer cells, develop drug resistance, exhibit traits of the persister phenotype (an extremely slow-growing physiological state which makes them insensitive to drug treatment) and quorum sensing (a system of stimulus and response correlated to population density), and display many other collective behaviour capabilities and cooperative strategies necessary for survival under extreme stress. These characteristics present cancer cells {{in a different light}} - smart communicating cells - and tend to portray tumours as societies of cells capable of making decisions. [...] Thus, the MRK model posits that the stochasticity in interactions of IDPs that are overexpressed in cancer cells could facilitate learning by exploring the network search space and rewiring the network.|$|E

In a rat model of unilateral AKI, the administration of MVs promoted kidney recovery. One of the mechanisms of action is the acceleration of tubular <b>cell</b> <b>dedifferentiation</b> and growth. Both in vivo and in vitro, rat HGF expression in damaged rat tubular cells was greatly enhanced by MV treatment. In addition, human HGF mRNA present in MVs was delivered into rat tubular cells and translated into the HGF protein as another mechanism of HGF induction. RNase treatment abrogated all MV effects. In the in vitro experimental setting, the conditioned medium of MV-treated injured tubular cells, which contains a higher concentration of HGF, strongly stimulated <b>cell</b> <b>dedifferentiation</b> and growth, as well as Erk 1 / 2 signaling activation. Intriguingly, these effects were completely abrogated by either c-Met inhibitor or MEK inhibitor, suggesting that HGF induction is a crucial contributor to the acceleration of <b>cell</b> <b>dedifferentiation</b> and growth.

40|$|SummaryMany {{multicellular}} organisms have remarkable {{capability to}} regenerate new organs after wounding. As {{a first step}} of organ regeneration, adult somatic cells often dedifferentiate to reacquire cell proliferation potential, but mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown in plants. Here we show that an AP 2 /ERF transcription factor, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION 1 (WIND 1), {{is involved in the}} control of <b>cell</b> <b>dedifferentiation</b> in Arabidopsis. WIND 1 is rapidly induced at the wound site, and it promotes <b>cell</b> <b>dedifferentiation</b> and subsequent cell proliferation to form a mass of pluripotent cells termed callus. We further demonstrate that ectopic overexpression of WIND 1 is sufficient to establish and maintain the dedifferentiated status of somatic cells without exogenous auxin and cytokinin, two plant hormones that are normally required for <b>cell</b> <b>dedifferentiation</b> [1]. InÂ vivo imaging of a synthetic cytokinin reporter [2] reveals that wounding upregulates the B-type ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR) -mediated cytokinin response and that WIND 1 acts via the ARR-dependent signaling pathway to promote <b>cell</b> <b>dedifferentiation.</b> This study provides novel molecular insights into how plants control <b>cell</b> <b>dedifferentiation</b> in response to wounding...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The adult {{mammalian}} renal tubular epithelium {{exists in}} a relatively quiescent to slowly replicating state, but has great potential for regenerative morphogenesis following severe ischemic or toxic injury. Kidney regeneration and repair occur through three cellular and molecular mechanisms: differentiation of the somatic stem cells, recruitment of circulating stem cells and, more importantly, proliferation/dedifferentiation of mature <b>cells.</b> <b>Dedifferentiation</b> seems to represent a critical step for the recovery of tubular integrity. <b>Dedifferentiation</b> of tubular <b>cells</b> after injury {{is characterized by the}} reactivation of a mesenchymal program that is active during nephrogenesis. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of renal tubular cells is an extreme manifestation of epithelial cell plasticity. It is now widely recognized as a fundamental process that marks some physiological, such as morphogenesis, as well as pathological events, such as oncogenesis and fibrogenesis. It might be also considered as a key event in the regenerative process of the kidney. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in EMT might be useful for designing therapeutic strategies in order to potentiate the innate capacity of the kidney to regenerate...|$|R
40|$|Dedifferentiation is the {{transformation}} of cells from a given differentiated state to a less differentiated or stem cell-like state. Stem cell-related genes play important roles in dedifferentiation, which exhibits similar histone modification and DNA methylation features to stem cell maintenance. Hence, stem cell-related factors possibly synergistically function to provide a specific niche beneficial to dedifferentiation. During callus formation in Arabidopsis petioles, cells adjacent to procambium cells (stem cell-like cells) are dedifferentiated and survive more easily than other cell types. This finding indicates that stem cells or stem cell-like cells may influence the dedifferentiating niche. In this paper, we provide {{a brief overview of}} stem <b>cell</b> maintenance and <b>dedifferentiation</b> regulation.

This study aimed to investigate changes of epithelial cell phenotype after COM attachment and whether L-carnitine could protect cells against subsequent COM crystals adhesion. Methods: Cultured MDCK cells were employed and E-cadherin and Vimentin were used as markers to estimate the differentiate state. AlexaFluor- 488 -tagged COM crystals were used in crystals adhesion experiment to distinguish from the previous COM attachment, and adhesive crystals were counted under fluorescence microscope, which were also dissolved and the calcium concentration was assessed by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results: Dedifferentiated MDCK cells induced by transforming growth factor Î² 1 (TGF-Î² 1) shown higher affinity to COM crystals.

The {{purpose of this}} work was to study the effect of Î± 2 -adrenergic signaling on injury-induced ERK and MÃ¼ller <b>cell</b> <b>dedifferentiation.</b> We tested the hypothesis that Î± 2 -stimulation triggers negative feedback regulation of the injury-induced ERK pathway that attenuates MÃ¼ller <b>cell</b> <b>dedifferentiation.</b> Methods: Chicken retina injured by N-methyl-D-aspartate and cultured primary MÃ¼ller cells were stimulated by the Î± 2 -adrenergic agonist brimonidine. Immunostaining, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot techniques in combination with receptor blockers were used for analysis of the cellular responses. Results: Alpha 2 -adrenergic receptor stimulation attenuated injury-induced ERK activation and dedifferentiation of MÃ¼ller cells as seen by decreased phospho-ERK, expression of transitin, and retinal progenitor cell genes. The attenuation was concomitant with a synergistic upregulation of several negative ERK-signal feedback regulators including ERK-phosphatases, Raf 1 -, and growth factor receptorâbinding proteins.

BackgroundHuman immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) {{is the most}} common cause of renal failure in HIV- 1 âseropositive patients. Recent studies using an HIV- 1 transgenic mouse model have demonstrated that expression of HIV- 1 in the kidney is required for the development of HIVAN. What has remained unclear, however, is the renal cell type responsible for pathogenesis and the essential pathological process. MethodsTo address these issues, we used a transgenic murine model of HIVAN. We identified the cell types in kidney in which HIV transgene expression occurs using in situ hybridization. We evaluated evidence of proliferation by immunocytochemical analysis using an antibody to Ki- 67 and cell type-specific markers, including WT- 1, synaptopodin, Na+,K+-ATPase, adducin, and desmin. TUNEL assay was used to evaluate apoptosis. ResultsWe found that glomerular and tubular epithelial cells express the HIV- 1 transgene early in the disease process when renal architecture is well preserved. Transgene expression is lost, however, in tubular epithelial cells when they lose their differentiated cuboidal phenotype. In glomerular epithelial <b>cells,</b> <b>dedifferentiation</b> occurs with reduced expression of WT- 1 and synaptopodin, in association with activation of desmin expression. Tubular microcysts also form with mislocalization of Na+,K+-ATPase expression to the lateral and apical cellular membranes.

The unpredictability of mating behavior made it evident that for adequate control of the material, factors governing sexuality would have to be investigated. There have been many reports in the literature, beginning with Klebs (1896), that the presence of light and depletion of nutrients may induce sexuality in a number of microorganisms. In this paper we present evidence that in C. reinhardi, depletion of one component of the medium, the nitrogen source, leads to the differentiation of vegetative cells into gametes; and that following the addition of a nitrogen source to gametic <b>cells,</b> <b>dedifferentiation</b> occurs to the vegetative state. Light appears to act indirectly, by way of photosynthesis, and is not obligatory for zygote formation of dark-grown nitrogen-depleted cells.

40|$|Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour {{suppressor}} gene underlies both VHL disease, an inherited multi-cancer syndrome, {{and the majority of}} sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinomas (CCRCCs). The best established function of pVHL is regulation of HIF (hypoxia inducible factor). However, how VHL functions as a renal tumour {{suppressor gene}} remains to be fully elucidated. There is extensive evidence that changes in cell-cell adhesion and loss of epithelial cytoarchitecture are pivotal in the progression of tumours of epithelial origin, allowing cell-cell dissociation and subsequent invasion. The main objective of this thesis has been to identify whether VHL regulates epithelial cell characteristics, and, if so, whether this is mediated via HIF. The major findings are as follows: First, VHL loss-of-function has striking effects on the expression and localisation of several tight junction (TJ) components (occludin, claudin 1 and ZO-l) in both VHL defective CCRCC cells and sporadic CCRCC tissue (compared to adjacent unaffected kidney). Secondly disruption of TJs was detected in the earliest lesions of VHL inactivation in VHL patient kidneys, suggesting a potential role in tumour initiation. Thirdly re-expression the adherens junction (AJ) protein E-cadherin did not rescue TJ formation, showing that the TJ defect occurs independently of AJ breakage. Fourthly, VHL is required for formation of the primary cilium, a luminal hair-like structure which senses renal tubular flow and which is disturbed in most renal cystic diseases. Finally activation of HIF promotes dedifferentiation of renal epithelial <b>cells.</b> <b>Dedifferentiation</b> may allow <b>cells</b> to tolerate further mutations and undergo full malignant transformation. I have also shown that HDAC inhibitors can reverse this phenotype and therefore may be of use therapeutically. In summary, the work presented in this thesis provides significant insights into understanding how the VHL/HIF pathway contributes to tumour development in both VHL defective renal cancers and hypoxic non-renal tumours.

Although many studies have shown various mechanisms underlying Schwann <b>cell</b> <b>dedifferentiation,</b> the molecular mechanism contributing to the re-expression of p 75 NGFR in differentiated Schwann cells is largely unknown. In the present study, we found that lysosomes were transiently activated in Schwann cells after nerve injury and that the inhibition of lysosomal activation by chloroquine or lysosomal acidification inhibitors prevented p 75 NGFR expression at the mRNA transcriptional level in an ex vivo Wallerian degeneration model. Lysosomal acidification inhibitors suppressed demyelination, but not axonal degeneration, thereby suggesting that demyelination mediated by lysosomes may be an important signal for inducing p 75 NGFR expression. Tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) has been suggested to be involved in regulating p 75 NGFR expression in Schwann cells. In this study, we found that removing TNF-Î± in vivo did not significantly suppress the induction of both lysosomes and p 75 NGFR.

Since research in {{tissue engineering}} always consumes a lot of cells, simple and cheap isolation methods could form a powerful basis to boost such studies and enable their faster progress to the clinics. Isolated chondrocytes can be used for autologous chondrocyte implantation in cartilage repair, and are the base for valuable models to investigate cartilage phenotype preservation, as well as enable studies of molecular features, nature and scales of cellular responses to alterations in the cartilage tissue. Methods Isolation and consequent cultivation of primary human adult articular chondrocytes from the surgical waste obtained during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was performed. To evaluate the chondrogenic potential of the isolated cells, gene expression of collagen type 2 (COL 2), collagen 1 (COL 1) and aggrecan (ACAN) was evaluated. Immunocytochemical staining of all mentioned proteins was performed to evaluate chondrocyte specific production. Results Cartilage specific gene expression of COL 2 and ACAN has been shown that the proposed protocol leads to isolation of cells with a high chondrogenic potential, possibly even specific phenotype preservation up to the second passage. COL 1 expression has confirmed the tendency of the isolated <b>cells</b> <b>dedifferentiation</b> into a fibroblast-like phenotype already in the second passage, which confirms previous findings that higher passages should be used with care in cartilage tissue engineering.

EGF, phorbol esters or TGF-beta 1 predominantly increased PAI- 1 protein expression in TSH-treated cells. The maximal increase of PAI- 1 mRNA steady-state level was observed 6 h after EGF treatment and sustained up to 48 h. Recombinant PAI- 1 inhibited cell-associated plasmin activity and delayed cell spreading. Enhanced synthesis and secretion of PAI- 1 upon treatment with different growth factors during dedifferentiation process and spreading may be considered a feed-back defence mechanism of the cells to harmful extracellular stimuli. status: publishe...|$|R
