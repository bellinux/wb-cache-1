5000|$|A 12-metre (40~ feet) {{parabolic}} antenna {{was used to}} receive and transmit information to geostationary satellites, which served as the forerunners to modern telecommunication satellites. The steerable crossed yagi antenna was used to transmit and receive telemetry from various spacecraft of that era. The transmitters used Klystron power amplifiers and the receivers were cryogenically <b>cooled</b> <b>maser</b> devices, there were additional smaller VHF antenna's onsite used to control the various functions of spacecraft and which also sent and received information, the antenna's were operated by the [...] "Telemetry and Command" [...] crew of the station whilst additional personnel performed the actual experiments.|$|E
40|$|The {{status of}} {{technology}} is reported for various 1 - to 4 -K commercially available refrigeration systems {{capable of producing}} 1. 5 -K refrigeration to <b>cool</b> <b>masers</b> and superconducting cavity oscillators on the proposed beam waveguide antenna. The design requirements for the refrigeration system and the cryostat are presented. A continuously operating evaporation refrigerator that uses capillary tubing to provide a continuous, self-regulating flow of helium at approximately 1. 5 K has been selected as the first refrigerator design for the beam waveguide antenna...|$|R
40|$|A {{closed cycle}} {{refrigeration}} (CCR) system is disclosed for providing cooling at {{different parts of}} a maser. The CCR includes a first station for <b>cooling</b> the <b>maser's</b> parts, except the amplifier portion, to 4. 5 K. The CCR further includes means with a 3. 0 K station for <b>cooling</b> the <b>maser's</b> amplifier to 3. 0 K and, thereby, increases the maser's gain and/or bandwith by a significant factor. The means which provide the 3. 0 K cooling include a pressure regulator, heat exchangers, an expansion valve, and a vacuum pump, which coact to cause helium, provided from a compressor, to liquefy and thereafter expand so as to vaporize. The heat of vaporization for the helium {{is provided by the}} maser amplifier, which is thereby cooled to 3. 0 K...|$|R
40|$|Prototype cooled low-noise {{microwave}} amplifiers {{based on}} high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMT's) considered as replacements for <b>cooled</b> ruby <b>masers</b> used as low-noise receiver-front-end amplifiers in communications, radio science, radar systems, radio astronomy, and telemetry. HEMT amplifier operates at 12 K, requires less cooling power and operates at lower cost with simpler, more-reliable cooling system...|$|R
40|$|A compact {{refrigerator}} {{designed specifically}} for <b>cooling</b> a microwave <b>maser</b> low-noise amplifier is capable of removing heat at a continuous rate of 180 mW at a temperature of 2. 5 K. This refrigerator {{is a combination of}} (1) a commercial Gifford-McMahon (GM) refrigerator nominally rated for cooling to 4 K and (2) a Joule-Thomson (J-T) circuit. The GM refrigerator pre-cools the J-T circuit, which provides the final stage of cooling. The refrigerator is compact and capable of operating in any orientation. Moreover, in comparison with a typical refrigerator heretofore used to <b>cool</b> a <b>maser</b> to 4. 5 K, this refrigerator is simpler and can be built at less than half the cost...|$|R
40|$|A data {{acquisition}} and display system that automatically monitors {{the performance of}} the 4. 5 -K closed-cycle refrigerators used to cryogenically <b>cool</b> traveling-wave <b>masers</b> is described. The system displays and stores operating parameters for the purpose of providing status information, failure prediction, and analysis. A prototype of this system will be installed at Deep Space Network 12 in the near future. The advantages of using commercial {{data acquisition}} hardware with installed operating systems and BASIC programs for this application are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Present and {{possible}} future performance {{for many of}} the existing and new commercial frequency standards is presented here. Recent progress in the gas cell atomic standards with regards to size and cost is significant and considerable improvement is expected. Cesium beam standards will benefit in stability and accuracy from optical pumping. <b>Cooled</b> hydrogen <b>masers</b> will offer extremely good stability. Advances in trapped ion and cesium fountain technologies make them good high performance candidates for the future. The quartz oscillator field is more mature and consequently performance improvements for the future are going to be less spectacular. Oscillators stabilized to GPS will have many applications. Recent performance of cooled microwave dielectric resonator oscillators is very good and they offer the promise of serving as flywheel oscillators for advanced performance atomic standards...|$|R
5000|$|Scovil {{received}} his D. Phil. in 1951 from University of Oxford for his thesis [...] "Investigation of Paramagnetic Substances at Centimetre Wave-Lengths", studied paramagnetic resonance at Clarendon Laboratory, {{then moved to}} Bell Labs where he, George Feher, and H. Seidel built the first tunable, solid state maser. In the late 1950s he and colleagues constructed ruby travelling wave <b>masers,</b> <b>cooled</b> to 4.2K by liquid helium, which were then the world's lowest-noise microwave amplifiers. They were used by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson in their investigations of the cosmic microwave background.|$|R
40|$|High-velocity {{collisions}} between small, dense, neutral clouds {{or between}} a dense cloud and a dense shell {{can provide the}} energy source required to excite H 2 O maser emission. The radiative precursor {{from the surface of}} the collisional shock front rapidly diffuses through the cloud, heating the dust grains but leaving the H 2 molecules <b>cool.</b> Transient <b>maser</b> emission occurs as the conditions for the Goldreich and Kwan (1974) 'hot-dust cold-gas' maser pump scheme are realized locally within the cloud. In time, the local maser action quenches due to the heating of the H 2 molecules by collisions against the grains. Although this model cannot explain the very long-lived steady maser features, it is quite successful in explaining a number of the observed properties of the high-velocity features in such sources as Orion, W 51, and W 49. In particular, it provides a natural explanation for the rapid time variations, the narrow line widths, juxtaposition of high- and low-velocity features, and the short lifetimes which are frequently observed for the so-called high-velocity maser 'bullets' thought to be accelerated by strong stellar winds...|$|R
40|$|A total system noise {{temperature}} of 6. 6 K was demonstrated with an 8. 4 -GHz traveling wave maser and feedhorn {{operating in a}} cryogenic environment. Both the maser and feedhorn were inserted in the helium cryostat, with the maser operating in the 1. 6 -K liquid bath and the feedhorn cooled in the helium gas, with a temperature gradient along the horn ranging from the liquid bath temperature at its lower end to room temperature at its top. The ruby maser exhibited 43 dB of gain with a bandwidth of 76 MHz(- 3 dB) centered at 8400 MHz. Discussions of the <b>maser,</b> <b>cooled</b> feedhorn, and cryostat designs are presented along {{with a discussion of}} the {{noise temperature}} measurements...|$|R
5000|$|The {{next major}} step in high {{precision}} parallax measurements {{will come from}} Gaia, a space astrometry mission launched in 2013 and intended to measure stellar parallax to within 25 microarcseconds (Î¼as). [...] It was expected that Gaia {{would not be able}} to take measurements on bright stars like Polaris, but it may help with measurements of other members of assumed associations and with the general galactic distance scale. Radio telescopes have also been used to produce accurate parallax measurements at large distances, but these require a compact radio source in close association with the star which is typically only the case for <b>cool</b> supergiants with <b>masers</b> in their circumstellar material. Gaia was launched in 2013 and began its mission to record data ...|$|R
40|$|A helium {{refrigerator}} {{utilizing the}} Gifford-McMahon/Joule-Thomson (GM/JT) cycle {{was designed and}} tested to demonstrate the feasibility of using small closed-cycle refrigerators {{as an alternative to}} batch-filled cryostats for operating temperatures below 4 K. The systems could be used to <b>cool</b> low-noise microwave <b>maser</b> amplifiers located in large parabolic antennas. These antennas tilt vertically, making conventional liquid-filled dewars difficult to use. The system could also be used for a non-tilting beam waveguide antenna to reduce the helium consumption of a liquid helium cryostat. The prototype system is adjustable to provide 700 mW of cooling at 2. 5 K to 3 W at 4. 3 K. Performance of the unit is not significantly affected by physical orientation. The volume occupied by the refrigerator is less than 0. 1 cu m. Two JT expansion stages are used to maximize cooling capacity per unit mass flow. The heat exchangers were designed to produce minimum pressure drop in the return gas stream. Pressure drop for the entire JT return circuit is less than 5 kpa at a mass flow of 0. 06 g/sec when operating at 2. 5 K...|$|R
40|$|Exploration of the Solar System with {{automated}} spacecraft {{that are}} more than ten astronomical units (1 AU = 149, 597, 870. 691 km) from earth requires very large antennae employing extremely sensitive receivers. A key figure of merit in the specification of the spacecraft-to-earth telecommunications link is {{the ratio of the}} antenna gain to operatio nal noise temperature (G/Top) of the system. The Deep Space Network (DSN) receivers are cryogenic, low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) which addres s the need to maintain Top as low as technology permits. Historicall y, the extra-ordinarily sensitive receive systems operated by the DSN have required ctyogenically <b>cooled,</b> ruby <b>masers,</b> operating at a physi cal temperature near the boiling point of helium, as the LNA. Althoug h masers continue to be used today, they are hand crafted at JPL and expensive to manufacture and maintain. Recent advances in the developm ent of indium phosphide (InP) based high electron mobility transistor s (HEMTs) combined with cryogenic cooling near the boiling point of h ydrogen have made this alternate technology comparable with and {{a fraction of the cost}} of maser technology. InP HEMT LNA modules are demons trating noise temperatures less than ten times the quantum noise limi t (10 hf/k) from 1 to 100 GHz. To date, the lowest noise LNA modules developed for the DSN have demonstrated noise temperatures of 3. 5 K and 8. 5 K at 8. 5 K at 32 GHz, respectively. Front-end receiver packages employing these modules have demonstrated operating system noise temperatures of 17 K at 8. 4 GHz (on a 70 m antenna at zenith) and 39 K at 3 2 GHz (on a 34 m antenna at zenith). The development and demonstration of cryogenic, InP HEMT based front-end amplifiers for the DSN requir es accurate component and module characterization, and modeling from 1 to 100 GHz at physical temperatures down to 12 K. The characterizati on and modeling begins with the HEMT chip, proceeds to the multi-stag e HEMT LNA module, and culminates with the complete front-end cryogenic receiver package for the antenna. This presentation will provide a n overview of this development process. Examples will be shown for de vices, LNA modules, front-end receiver packages, antennae employing these packages and the improvements to the down-link capacity...|$|R
