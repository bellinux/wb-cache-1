The transmission is a simple lightweight, yet robust, configuration utilizing only two gear meshes, being comprised of an input gear, a <b>cluster</b> <b>gear,</b> and an output gear.

50|$|The {{shifting}} mechanism was chosen {{with the additional}} input of Richard Ansdale. Space requirements, {{and the length of}} the <b>gear</b> <b>cluster,</b> meant that the selection mechanism would have to be mounted inside the <b>gear</b> <b>cluster,</b> rather than the usual motorcycle arrangement of dog clutches between the gears, an external drum to control their engagement and forks to connect the two. The mechanism needed to lock the selected gear onto the shaft, never engage more than one at a time, and all had to work at racing speeds.|$|R

Models made by Douglas were primarily the Vespa 125 and 150 (VBB).|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} the intermolecular forces between water {{molecules}} is the same in small hydrogen-bonded clusters as in the bulk. The rotational spectra of the clusters therefore give insight into the intermolecular forces present in liquid water and ice. The water hexamer is the smallest water cluster to support low-energy structures with branched three-dimensional hydrogen-bond networks, rather than cyclic two-dimensional topologies. Here we report measurements of splitting patterns in rotational transitions of the water hexamer prism, and we used quantum simulations {{to show that they}} result from geared and antigeared rotations of a pair of water molecules. Unlike previously reported tunneling motions in water <b>clusters,</b> the <b>geared</b> motion involves the concerted breaking of two hydrogen bonds. Similar types of motion may be feasible in interfacial and confined water...|$|R
40|$|The design {{philosophy}} and measurements performed {{on a new}} roller-gear transmission prototype for a robotic manipulator are described. The design incorporates smooth rollers in a planetary configuration integrated with conventional toothed gears. The rollers were designed to handle low torque with low backlash and friction while the complementary gears support higher torques and prevent accumulated creep or slip of the rollers. The introduction of gears with finite numbers of teeth to function in parallel with the rollers imposes severe limits on available designs. Solutions for two-planet row designs are discussed. A two-planet row, four-planet design was conceived, fabricated, and tested. Detailed calculations of <b>cluster</b> geometry, <b>gear</b> stresses, and gear geometry are given. Measurement data reported here include transmission linearity, static and dynamic friction, inertia, backlash, stiffness, and forward and reverse efficiency. Initial test results are reported describing performance of the transmission in a servomechanism with torque feedback...|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the layout}} of the gearbox, the {{layshaft}} is normally mounted low-down in the gearbox casing below the other shafts. The gear lever enters through the top of the casing and so it is more convenient for the sliding components of the dog clutches to be mounted on the driven shaft, rather than the layshaft. The layshaft <b>gear</b> <b>cluster</b> is thus often a simple one-piece component, typically cast iron gears running in bearings on a fixed steel shaft. The bearings may be plain phosphor bronze bushes, or for high-load applications needle rollers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{vibration}} spectra for planetary gear systems by studying a kinematic model of vibration and comparing the model with measurements of two helicopter transmissions made in flight. The model and flight data include systems with both uniformly and nonuniformly spaced planet gears. This model predicts vibration to occur only at frequencies that are integer multiples {{of the planet}} spacing repetition frequency and <b>clustered</b> around <b>gear</b> mesh harmonics. Vibration measurements show the model correctly predicts the frequencies with large components around the first several harmonics of the gear mesh frequency. Measurements do not confirm {{some of the more}} detailed features predicted by the model. Some features in the spectra from the numerically derived model can be used to separate the model data with and without planted faults. These features were not found useful for detecting faults in the vibration measurements of real gearboxes in flight due to added complexity in the spectra from real gearboxes...|$|R

It is also rumored Hodaka might have indeed designed the complete Yamaguchi SPB50, not just the engine. Hodaka was also a producer of machine tools and it has been said they borrowed the concept of one of their quick-change <b>gear</b> <b>clusters</b> in one of their metalworking lathes to construct the shift mechanism in the Hodaka gearbox, with the resulting spring-loaded shifting mechanism being patented.|$|R
50|$|Where {{large numbers}} of gear ratios, six or more, are to be {{provided}} then these will require a third or more <b>gear</b> <b>clusters</b> on the layshaft. To maintain the proportions of the overall gearbox as more compact, rather than becoming long and thin, these gearboxes may use twin layshafts. This requires an additional driven gear for each layshaft, but the mechanism is otherwise very similar. The use of multiple layshafts also developed into the multiple clutch gearbox, used for some buses, where each ratio has its own layshaft and separate plate or hydraulic clutches, rather than dog clutches, are used to select between them.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} {{of science and}} technology as the root of exceptional regional economic development has been extolled since the time of Schumpeter. Today emerging technologies are signaling {{the start of a new}} economic cycle where regions that are effective in technology translation will gain advantage. The will of policymakers to translate technology into regional job and wealth creation seems to be at an all-time high. Yet an improved process for translating technical development into regional prosperity has proved elusive. If there are no processes other than applying techniques that have worked in the past for other regions to a new region then there is cause for concern. Here the authors seek to add to this field of knowledge by applying elements of the varied cluster theories to provide a basis for policy for regional economic development by turning science and technology into commercial innovation. We provide a review of current cluster theories and discuss the positive and negative issues associated with each. We propose a model that allows interested professionals to utilize aspects of each <b>cluster</b> perspective <b>geared</b> to the realities of their specific area...|$|R

They rode on the outside of the selector sleeve, not on the shaft itself. The output shaft of the gearbox had all five gears splined to it and in constant mesh with the other gears. On the outside of the selector sleeve was a ring of dogs, which could engage one gear at a time as the sleeve was slid {{back and forth}} through the <b>gear</b> <b>cluster.</b> The faces of these dogs were not flush, but were slightly offset, so that they engaged one by one.|$|R
30|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) were envisaged {{to become}} the fabric of our environment and society. However, they are yet unable to surmount many operational challenges such as limited network lifetime, which strangle their widespread deployment. To prolong WSN lifetime, most of the existing <b>clustering</b> schemes are <b>geared</b> towards homogeneous WSN. This paper presents enhanced developed distributed energy-efficient clustering (EDDEEC) scheme for heterogeneous WSN. EDDEEC mainly consists of three constituents i.e., heterogeneous network model, energy consumption model, and clustering-based routing mechanism. Our heterogeneous network model is based on three energy levels of nodes. Unlike most works, our energy consumption model {{takes into account the}} impact of radio environment. Finally, the proposed clustering mechanism of EDDEEC changes the cluster head selection probability in an efficient and dynamic manner. Simulation results validate and confirm the performance supremacy of EDDEEC compared to existing schemes in terms of various metrics such as network life.|$|R

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the vibration spectra is very useful for any gear fault detection scheme based upon vibration measurements. The vibration measured from planetary gears is complicated. Sternfeld noted the presence of sidebands about the gear mesh harmonics spaced at the planet passage frequency in spectra measured near the ring gear of a CH- 47 helicopter. McFadden proposes a simple model of the vibration transmission that predicts high spectral amplitudes at multiples of the planet passage frequency, for planetary gears with evenly spaced planets. This model correctly predicts no strong signal at the meshing frequency {{when the number of}} teeth on the ring gear is not an integer multiple of the number of planets. This paper will describe a model for planetary gear vibration spectra developed from the ideas started in reference. This model predicts vibration to occur only at frequencies that are multiples of the planet repetition passage frequency and <b>clustered</b> around <b>gear</b> mesh harmonics. Vibration measurements will be shown from tri-axial accelerometers mounted on three different planetary gear systems and compared with the model. The model correctly predicts the frequencies with large components around the first several gear mesh harmonics in measurements for systems with uniformly and nonuniformly spaced planet gears. Measurements do not confirm some of the more detailed features predicted by the model. Discrepancies of the ideal model to the measurements are believed due to simplifications in the model and will be discussed. Fault detection will be discussed applying the understanding will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fractographic study {{confirmed}} that the driving gear of the multiplicator had failed by fatigue. There was multiple fatigue crack initiation and in all the cases, the fatigue crack had initiated at the tooth root. In two cases, the teeth got fractured and lost by tooth bending fatigue. In another case, after initiation, the fatigue crack had propagated into {{the hub of the}} gear and continued propagation further along the hub fillet. After propagation to a critical length, this fatigue crack had resulted in fracturing of a segment of the gear. Following this fracture, the impact with the input gear of the <b>gear</b> <b>cluster</b> had resulted in second fracture and chewing off of remaining teeth in the driving gear. Subsequently, the gear assembly had seized leading to torsional overload failure of the quill shaft transmitting power from the AGB to the multiplicator. The fatigue failure in the driving gear appears to be stress related. Evidences suggest that probably, the load on the gear assembly was more than the usual. The power transmission system down the multiplicator needs to be examined as a whole for establishing the cause(s) for excessive load on the gear assembly...|$|R
50|$|The Lotus Twelve was {{the first}} to use the infamous Lotus 'Queerbox' transaxle. This was {{developed}} to be, in typical Chapman fashion, the smallest and lightest five-speed transmission possible, also to have a low driveshaft line allowing a low driving position, thus lower centre of mass and air resistance. Chapman also chose a transaxle over the usual gearbox and rear axle layout, as had been used in the first Twelve, as this gave a lower polar moment of inertia. The initial design, the work of Chapman and Harry Mundy, began with the principle of the most compact layout, with the <b>gear</b> <b>cluster</b> arranged in a closely spaced stack, akin to a motorcycle. As the gears shared common axes, and all teeth were cut to the same size, all the pairs of gear had the same number of teeth in total, 44. The stack was only 3+5//8 in long overall. This was likely to require sequential shifting, but that was no drawback in a racing car. The gears would also be easily changeable, to suit different circuits. Gears could be used with the same ratio in any position, to suit both hillclimbing or fast circuits, provided that they remained in a monotonic sequence.|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} {{and distribution of}} squid and fish collected by Rectangular Midwater Trawls in the upper 200 m were investigated during the BROKE-West (Baseline Research on Oceanography, Krill and the Environment-West) survey (January-March 2006) in CCAMLR Subdivision 58. 4. 2 of the Southern Ocean. A total of 332 individuals were collected, with the most abundant fish species being Pleuragramma antarcticum (34 %), Notolepis coatsi (27 %) and Electrona antarctica (26 %); and the most abundant squid being Galiteuthis glacialis (64 %). Abundances of all species were among the lowest recorded using this type of <b>gear.</b> <b>Cluster</b> analysis revealed two distinct communities: a notothenioid-dominated coastal community and an oceanic community dominated by mesopelagic fish and squid. Environmental factors related to this segregation were explored using Redundancy Analysis (RDA). The notothenioid P. antarcticum was associated with shallow areas with high chlorophyll a concentrations. Larval stages of E. antarctica, N. coatsi and G. glacialis were found over deeper water and were positively correlated with higher temperatures and a deeper-reaching mixed layer. Postmetamorphic stages of E. antarctica were caught mostly after sunset and were negatively correlated with solar elevation. The observation of higher densities {{in the eastern part}} of the sampling area reflects a temporal rather than a geographical effect. Samples of the three most abundant fishes, E. antarctica, P. antarcticum and N. coatsi, were analysed for gut content. All species fed on a variety of mesozooplankton including copepods, amphipods and euphausiids, which is consistent with previous reports on similar life stages. Mean body energy density was highest for E. antarctica (27 kJ g - 1), while it was similar for P. antarcticum and N. coatsi (22 kJ g - 1). The high energy content emphasizing the importance as a food resource for top predators in the Southern Ocean...|$|R
40|$|Clustering {{is one of}} {{the core}} {{problems}} of unsupervised machine learning. In a clustering problem we are given a set of data points and asked to partition them into smaller subgroups, known as clusters, such that each point is assigned to exactly one cluster. The quality of the obtained partitioning (clustering) is then evaluated according to some objective measure dependent on the specific clustering paradigm. A traditional approach within the machine learning community to solving clustering problems has been focused on approximative, local search algorithms that in general can not provide optimality guarantees of the clusterings produced. However, recent advances in the field of constraint optimization has allowed for an alternative view on clustering, and many other data analysis problems. The alternative view is based on stating the problem at hand in some declarative language and then using generic solvers for that language in order to solve the problem optimally. This thesis contributes to this approach to clustering by providing a first study on the applicability of state-of-the-art Boolean optimization procedures to cost-optimal correlation clustering under constraints in a general similarity-based setting. The correlation <b>clustering</b> paradigm is <b>geared</b> towards classifying data based on qualitative [...] - as opposed to quantitative similarity information of pairs of data points. Furthermore, correlation clustering does not require the number of clusters as input. This makes it especially well suited to problem domains in which the true number of clusters is unknown. In this thesis we formulate correlation clustering within the language of propositional logic. As is often done within computational logic, we focus only on formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF), a limitation which can be done without loss of generality. When encoded as a CNF-formula the correlation clustering problem becomes an instance of partial Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT), the optimization version of the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem. We present three different encodings of correlation clustering into CNF-formulas and provide proofs of the correctness of each encoding. We also experimentally evaluate them by applying a state-of-the-art MaxSAT solver for solving the resulting MaxSAT instances. The experiments demonstrate both the scalability of our method {{and the quality of the}} clusterings obtained. As a more theoretical result we prove that the assumption of the input graph being undirected can be done without loss of generality, this justifies our encodings being applicable to all variants of correlation clustering known to us. This thesis also addresses another clustering paradigm, namely constrained correlation clustering. In constrained correlation clustering additional constraints are used in order to restrict the acceptable solutions to the correlation clustering problem, for example according to some domain specific knowledge provided by an expert. We demonstrate how our MaxSAT-based approach to correlation clustering naturally extends to constrained correlation clustering. Furthermore we show experimentally that added user knowledge allows clustering larger datasets, decreases the running time of our approach, and steers the obtained clusterings fast towards a predefined ground-truth clustering.
