5|$|After the discovery, {{the rare}} element had only minor applications; for example, {{by the turn}} of the century, rhodium-containing {{thermocouples}} were used to measure temperatures up to 1800°C. The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating. The introduction of the three-way <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> used rhodium to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust.|$|E

40|$|The {{main task}} of {{automotive}} <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> is {{reducing the amount}} of harmful components of exhaust gases. Metallic <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> are an alternative to standard ceramic <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters.</b> Metallic carriers are usually made from FeCrAl steel, which is covered by a layer of Precious Group Metals (PGMs) acting as a catalyst. There are many methods used for recovery of platinum from ceramic carriers in the world, but the issue of platinum and other metals recovery from metallic carriers is poorly described.

5|$|Ceria is {{the most}} widely used {{compound}} of cerium. The main application of ceria is as a polishing compound, for example in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). In this application, ceria has replaced other metal oxides for the production of high-quality optical surfaces. Major automotive applications for the lower sesquioxide are as a <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles, Cerium(IV) sulfate is used as an oxidising agent in quantitative analysis. Cerium(IV) in methanesulfonic acid solutions is applied in industrial scale electrosynthesis as a recyclable oxidant. Ceric ammonium nitrate is used as an oxidant in organic chemistry and in etching electronic components, and as a primary standard for quantitative analysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} use of {{platinum}} is {{as a catalyst}} in chemical reactions, often as platinum black. It has been employed as a catalyst since the early 19th century, when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter,</b> which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst {{in a number of}} separate processes, but especially in catalytic reforming of straight-run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as Adams' catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for vegetable oils. Platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and it is used in fuel cells as a catalyst for the reduction of oxygen.|$|E

25|$|A <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> {{provides}} an environment for a chemical reaction wherein toxic combustion by-products are converted to less-toxic substances. First used on cars in 1975 to lower emission standards, catalytic converters {{are also used}} on generator sets, forklifts, mining equipment, trucks, buses, trains, and other engine-equipped machines. The three-way <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> was co-invented by John J. Mooney and Carl D. Keith at the Engelhard Corporation in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Development resumed, {{to improve}} {{emissions}} durability and ready the engine for more stringent 1975 standards. The fuel injection was redesigned for better air distribution. High-energy electronic ignition and mandatory <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> were added; also a Pulse Air system, functionally {{the same as}} an air pump but without the pump's six-horsepower loss. A larger <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> further guarded against power loss. More advanced ignition timing, and the lead-free fuel required with the converter, prevented exhaust-valve failure.|$|E

The 1975 LeSabre was the first to require use of unleaded gasoline, due to the advent of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter.</b> The LeSabre lineup offered a coupe and two sedans while the LeSabre Custom lineup offered the coupe, two sedans, and the only convertible in the Buick lineup. 1975 would be the final year for the LeSabre Custom Convertible with around 5,300 examples rolling off the assembly lines.|$|E

25|$|Finally {{the commune}} hosts a waste {{incinerator}} which disposes {{of the waste}} from 44 surrounding communes.

50|$|Free-flowing {{exhaust systems}} may {{maximize}} peak horsepower by reducing or eliminating back pressure; this is typically accomplished {{by making the}} path as straight as possible, using a consistent diameter throughout the system and eliminating obstacles such as <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> and pre-catalytic converters or by replacing the muffler with a less restrictive (and usually louder) one. Despite the potential for increased performance by eliminating <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> and other emissions control hardware, doing so will often render the vehicle illegal for street use in many jurisdictions. Other aftermarket modifications that bypass the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> and/or mufflers, such as electric or cable activated exhaust cutouts—which open and reroute the exhaust flow to bypass restrictions in the system—can similarly increase performance, though would likely be illegal in areas where tampering with emissions devices is prohibited, particularly when {{placed in front of}} the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters.</b>|$|R

25|$|The World Bank has {{sponsored}} {{a project to}} curb air pollution through public transport improvements and the Mexican government has started shutting down polluting factories. They have phased out diesel buses and mandated new emission controls on new cars; since 1993 all new cars must be fitted with a <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter,</b> which reduces the emissions released. Trucks must use only liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).|$|E
25|$|A third cause {{might be}} {{cracks in the}} engine block from {{overtightening}} the head bolts. Some engines developed cracks in the block that would leak coolant and/or oil, sometimes accompanied by broken head bolts directly above the crack. The leak would spray coolant or oil, the latter resulting in fire if sprayed onto the hot <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> or exhaust manifold {{at the front of}} the engine compartment.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{widespread}} {{introduction of}} <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> {{was in the}} United States automobile market. To comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's stricter regulation of exhaust emissions, most gasoline-powered vehicles starting with the 1975 model year must be equipped with <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters.</b> These [...] "two-way" [...] converters combined oxygen with carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). In 1981, two-way <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> were rendered obsolete by [...] "three-way" [...] converters that also reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx); however, two-way converters are still used for lean-burn engines. This is because three-way-converters require either rich or stoichiometric combustion to successfully reduce NOx.|$|R

25|$|NOx {{is either}} reduced by {{catalytic}} reduction with ammonia in a <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> (selective catalytic reduction, SCR) or by a high-temperature reaction with ammonia in the furnace (selective non-catalytic reduction, SNCR). Urea {{may be substituted}} for ammonia as the reducing reagent but must be supplied earlier in the process {{so that it can}} hydrolyze into ammonia. Substitution of urea can reduce costs and potential hazards associated with storage of anhydrous ammonia.|$|E
25|$|In some of {{the most}} {{efficient}} burners, the temperature of the smoke is raised to a much higher temperature where the smoke will itself burn (e.g. 609°C for igniting carbon monoxide gas). This may result in significant reduction of smoke hazards while also providing additional heat from the process. By using a <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter,</b> the temperature for obtaining cleaner smoke can be reduced. Some U.S. jurisdictions prohibit sale or installation of stoves that do not incorporate catalytic converters.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{power station}} {{operators}} {{around the world}} began to install Passive Auto-catalytic hydrogen Recombiners ("PARs"), which do not require electricity to operate.

Had such devices been positioned {{at the top of}} Fukushima I's reactor and containment buildings, where hydrogen gas collected, the explosions would not have occurred and the releases of radioactive isotopes would arguably have been much less.|$|E
