40|$|Cholera {{has been}} very rare in industrialized nations for the last 100 years; however, the disease is still common today {{in other parts of}} the world, {{including}} the Indian subcontinent and sub-Saharan Africa. Cholera is an acute, diarrhoeal illness caused by infection of the intestine by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The infection is often mild or without symptoms, but it sometimes can be severe. Approximately one in 20 infected persons have severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhoea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these persons, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours. A person may get cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the <b>cholera</b> <b>bacterium.</b> In an epidemic, the source of the contamination is usually the faeces of an infected person. The disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water. In an effort to curb the spread of the disease, Rand Water routinely monitors for Vibrio cholerae. The number of isolates identified as Vibrio cholerae non-O 1 over a three-year period was evaluated to determine seasonal trends. Vibrio cholerae non-O 1 was predominant in the warmer seasons. This may be due to the higher temperatures experienced which favourably influences V. cholerae. In addition, rainfall generally increases the numbers of V. cholerae isolated, as run-off from farms and abattoirs enter rivers and streams. The seasons with lower temperatures found V. cholerae non-O 1 numbers much lower. In a developing country like South Africa, monitoring for Vibrio cholerae is of great significance as large numbers of the population are exposed to water systems that may potentially hold the <b>cholera</b> <b>bacterium...</b>|$|E
40|$|A cholera {{epidemic}} {{that swept}} through Central Asia in 1892 transformed visions {{and practices of}} empire in Tashkent.

Execution of anticholera measures, however, altered a colonial relationship, provoking unrest among the local population. Russian settlers joined soldiers in brutally repressing a cholera riot sparked by numerous attacks on Central Asian culture.

40|$|The Vibrio <b>cholerae</b> <b>bacterium</b> causes devastating {{diarrhea}} when it infects {{the human}} intestine. The key event is adenosine diphosphate (ADP) –ribosylation {{of the human}} signaling protein GSa, catalyzed by the cholera toxin A 1 subunit (CTA 1). This reaction is allosterically activated by human ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), a family of essential and ubiquitous G proteins. Crystal structures of a CTA 1 :ARF 6 -GTP (guanosine triphosphate) complex reveal that binding of the human activator elicits dramatic changes in CTA 1 loop regions that allow nico-tinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADþ) to bind to the active site.

40|$|The histone-like {{nucleoid}} structuring protein (H-NS) {{functions as}} a transcriptional silencer by binding to AT-rich sequences at bacterial promoters. However, H-NS repression can be counteracted by other transcription factors in response to environmental changes. The identification of potential toxic factors, the expression of which is prevented by H-NS could facilitate the discovery of new regulatory proteins that {{may contribute to the}} emergence of new pathogenic variants by anti-silencing. Vibrio cholerae hns mutants of the El Tor biotype exhibit altered virulence, motility and environmental stress response phenotypes compared to wild type. We used an RNA-seq analysis approach to determine the basis of the above hns phenotypes and identify new targets of H-NS transcriptional silencing. H-NS affected the expression of 18 % of all predicted genes in a growth phase-dependent manner. Loss of H-NS resulted in diminished expression of numerous genes encoding methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins as well as chemotaxis toward the attractants glycine and serine. Deletion of hns also induced an endogenous envelope stress response resulting in elevated expression of rpoE encoding the extracytoplamic sigma factor E (σE). The RNA-seq analysis identified new genes directly repressed by H-NS that can affect virulence and biofilm development in the El Tor biotype <b>cholera</b> <b>bacterium.</b> We show that H-NS and the quorum sensing regulator HapR silence the transcription of the vieSAB three-component regulatory system in El Tor biotype V. cholerae. We also demonstrate that H-NS directly represses the transcription of hlyA (hemolysin), rtxCA (the repeat in toxin or RTX), rtxBDE (RTX transport) and the biosynthesis of indole. Of these genes, H-NS occupancy at the hlyA promoter was diminished by overexpression of the transcription activator HlyU.
