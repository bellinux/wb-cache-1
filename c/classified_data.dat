25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, based on <b>classified</b> <b>data</b> {{about the state of}} the U.S. economy and society {{supplied}} to him by fellow analysts at FAPSI, Panarin forecast the probable disintegration of the US into six parts in 2010 (at the end of June – start of July 2010, as he specified on 10 December 2008), following a civil war triggered by mass immigration, economic decline, and moral degradation. He forecast financial and demographic changes provoking a political crisis in which wealthier states will withhold funds from the federal government, effectively seceding from the Union, leading to social unrest, civil war, national division, and intervention of foreign powers. Panarin sees the task of the world elite as not letting the USA follow the Yugoslavian model of disintegration; it is desirable that it follows the Czechoslovakian model of disintegration so that everything goes calmly and peacefully.|$|E
2500|$|The {{laboratory}} {{has attracted}} negative publicity {{from a number}} of events. [...] In 1999, Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee was accused of 59 counts of mishandling classified information by downloading nuclear secrets—"weapons codes" [...] used for computer simulations of nuclear weapons tests—to data tapes and removing them from the lab. After ten months in jail, Lee pleaded guilty to a single count and the other 58 were dismissed with an apology from U.S. District Judge James Parker for his incarceration. Lee had been suspected for having shared U.S. nuclear secrets with China, but investigators were never able to establish what Lee did with the downloaded data. In 2000, two computer hard drives containing <b>classified</b> <b>data</b> were announced to have gone missing from a secure area within the laboratory, but were later found behind a photocopier; in 2003, the laboratory's director John Browne, and deputy director, resigned following accusations that they had improperly dismissed two whistleblowers who had alleged widespread theft at the lab. The year 2000 brought additional hardship for the laboratory {{in the form of the}} Cerro Grande Fire, a severe forest fire that destroyed several buildings (and employees' homes) and forced the laboratory to close for two weeks.|$|E

3000|$|The SVM (Mountrakis et al. 2011) is a {{classification}} algorithm, generally used {{to validate the}} results of FS as well as embedded in ranking and subset selection for Wrapper and Embedded methods (Chen and Lin 2006). SVM is an efficient supervised learning algorithm, which is largely used in the detection and the recognition of objects (faces, hand-written characters, text [...]...) from signals (images, videos [...]...). During learning, SVM attempts to design hyper planes that leave the maximum margin of classes, to separate and <b>classify</b> <b>data.</b> Several kernel functions exist such as linear, polynomial, and radial basis (RBF). To analyze features characterizing driving fatigue, we use RBF kernel, which <b>classifies</b> <b>data</b> even if classes are non-linearly separable.|$|R
