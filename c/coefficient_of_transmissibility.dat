40|$|A {{pumping test}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate aquifer characteristics, the percentage of tube well discharge derived from the stream, and the effective distance to the stream simulated as a fully penetrating plane source of constant head. The formulae are applicable although a natural stream is seldom fully penetrating, because {{the distance from the}} stream to an equivalent fully penetrating but imaginary plane source can be calculated. When pumping begins, the tube well obtains most of its water from the immediate vicinity, but as the cone of influence expands, it receives a part of its water from the stream until a time is reached when it draws the entire amount of water from the stream. This will of course depend upon the aquifer characteristics, the tube well discharge, distance of the tube well from stream and the infiltration regimen of the stream. Different methods were used to find the distance of stream equivalent to a fully penetrating plane source, the determination of <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmissibility</b> and coefficient of storage, and, lastly, the amount of water that the tube well intercepts from the stream. The distance of the stream as a fully penetrating plane source by Rorabaugh’s modification of the Theis formula ranges from l' 70 feet to ioo feet and the value of <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmissibility</b> is 0. 77 cubic ft. /sec. / ft. The equivalent distance by Stallman’s modification of the Theis formula is l 90 feet and <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmissibility</b> 0. 6 g. The equivalent distance by the inflection point method of Hantush ranges from 1500 feet to 2100 feet, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmissibility</b> from 0. 73 to 0. 79 cubic ft. /sec. and coefficient of storage is 0. 05. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmissibility</b> by considering it as a leaky aquifer is 0. 715 cubic ft. /sec. The coefficient of storage by the volume method is 0. 065 and the contribution of the stream to the tube well discharge is 86 %. The contribution of the stream to the tube well is 93 % by the image theory. The results derived, based on mathematical theory, were also checked by preparing contour maps of drawdown for different times and calculating the volume dewatered by the pumping well at different times and plotting it against total pumpage and thus estimating the coefficient of storage. }or the determination of effective distance, only distant pipes from the tube well were used to avoid effects due to partial penetration and non-radial flow. The data for later time were used assuming that canal leakage fully affected the pipe under analysis and it was not a time variable. As determination of T and S was based upon the inflection point on a time drawdown curve for the analysis, only pipes near the canals were chosen, where the recharge was predominant, and so the determination of inflection point and maximum drawdown were easier. To find the maximum drawdown, the drawdown data of pipes near the canal were replotted on uniform scale against l/t and the maximum drawdown was determined from the tangent to the curve...|$|E

In this paper, new methods of analyzing drawdown-tests are developed and illustrated with the example to determine aquifer coefficients. In a double-layered aquifer, the analytical solution of drawdown test, in which water is discharged from both layers, is derived.

The sediments underlying the area consist of about 100 meters (328 feet) of gravel, sand and clay of Quaternary age and are bounded on {{the north and south}} by relatively impermeable metamorphic rocks.

40|$|Data of {{numerous}} multiple step drawdown tests performed on selected partially penetrating pumped wells {{installed in the}} Punjab Portion of West Pakistan, have been analyzed in detail, to study the variation with time of the formation loss coefficient 'B' and well loss coefficient 'C' which appear in Jacob's (1947) original equation for total drawdown inside a pumped well. In Jacob's equation, sw = BQ + CQ^ 2, where s represents the total drawdown in the pumped well, and Q its discharge. Assuming the formation coefficient 'B' to be an index {{of the development of}} convergence which is associated with partially penetrating wells, a study is made to determine whether this coefficient is invariant or whether it changes with time. It was found that coefficient 'B' increased with time whereas coefficient 'C' remained essentially constant, It is shown that Jacob's equation for drawdown in a pumped well needs modification when applied to partially penetrating wells. To account for the effect of partial penetration Hantush's (1961) relationship for drawdown in a partially penetrating well is utilized. It is compared with Jacob's equation for drawdown to obtain the modified value <b>of</b> <b>coefficient</b> 'B' in dimensionless form. The investigations show that the magnitudes of modified values of 'B' in dimensionless form compare favorably with Hantushs corresponding E factor. The nature of losses that occur in pumping wells have also been described. The <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmissibility</b> are determined, for various sites, using values of B determined from analysis of the multiple step drawdown tests. These values are utilized in the present study. It should be mentioned that in this thesis the term entrance loss is defined differently than heretofore. Entrance loss includes all head loss over and above the ?formation loss (designated BQ by Jacob) for the case of 100 % penetration of aquifer by the pumped well. That is, entrance loss here includes the added formation loss due to partial penetration as well as the well loss due to turbulent flow of water into and inside the well (CQ^ 2) ...|$|R

40|$|Tombstone, 73 miles {{southeast}} of Tucson, has been a site of extensive dewatering for mining operations. During an 8 -year period between 1901 and 1911, a total of 36, 900 acre-feet of water was withdrawn from ground-water storage in the mine rocks with a maximum decline in water level of 440 feet. For the 8 -year period of pumping, this volume of water could have supported a city of 30, 000 population. The sedimentary rocks within the mining district have a composite thickness of 8, 600 feet and include the normal stratigraphic sequence of southeastern Arizona from the Precambrian Pinal Schist {{to the top of}} the Cretaceous Bisbee Formation 0 Siliceous and quartzoseclastic rocks within the mining district have been altered to quartzite, hornfels, and jasperoid and have the best porosity and permeability as a result of innumerable fractures and fissures. Among the siliceous rocks, the Bolsa Quartzite and Bisbee Formation are the best waterbearing units within the district,. The carbonate rocks, predominant in the section, have been fractured and subjected to solutioning 0 They have their best porosity and permeability within the zone of maximum circulation near the water table. The mining district is bordered on the west by the impermeable Schieffelin Granodiorite and related intrusives that partly isolate the district from areas of natural ground-water discharge along the San Pedro River. The district is bordered on the south and east by predominantly crystalline carbonate rocks, The igneous core of the Mule and Dragoon Mountains lies farther to the east, An alluvial valley with large ground-water storage lies immediately north and northeast of the mining district A review of the history of previous water development indicates that the magnitude of the yield of the aquifer complex has been exaggerated out of proportion as a result of circumstances connected with dewatering operations. For comparative purposes the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmissibility</b> of the aquifer complex is estimated as 10, 000 to 15, 000 gallons per day per foot and the coefficient of storage is estimated as. 01. Prediction of the aquifer performance using these two coefficients is greatly modified by anisotropy and boundary conditions within the aquifer complex, and the yield is rapidly reduced with time. As a result, empirical loglog approximations of the time-drawdown curves are proposed for predicting the long-term performance of the aquifer complex 0 The geohydrologic evidence indicates that the Tombstone mining district may provide a suitable location for long-term, moderate production of municipal water. With extensive development, the aquifer complex could support a population several times the present size of Tombstone, but this would result in an appreciable drawdown of the water table.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to augment}} current structural health monitoring (SHM) practice with {{an approach to}} model and quantify uncertainty to enable confidence-based decision-making. The SHM application domain is vibration data-based system identification, and more specifically, transmissibility and frequency response function (FRF) estimations are considered, as these are the primary forms of transfer function estimation in the frequency domain. A finite element (FE) model is established in order to supply a benchmark of transmissibility evaluations, and by tuning the FE model, structural damages can be simulated. Two SHM features are proposed to detect and localize defects by analyzing the features calculated at certain interest point arrays. Considering a realistic test condition, all of the model parameters and data are subject to uncertainty from various sources leading to ambiguous system identification results that cause false alarms (Type-I error) when evaluating hypothesis testing for damage. Based upon stationary Gaussian random process, this dissertation statistically establishes uncertainty quantification (UQ) models for different estimators, and uncertainties of transmissibility and FRF are therefore quantified. A perturbation approach is implemented ending up with standard deviation and bias <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmissibility</b> magnitude estimations. Probability density functions (PDFs) of transmissibility and FRF estimation are derived, for both magnitude and phase, via different methods, namely Chi-square and Gaussian bivariate approach. The proposed statistical models are validated by Monte-Carlo test on both FE simulation model and real lab-scale structure. To obtain a more stringent validation condition, extraneous artificial noise is added onto the raw measurements. Compared to the pre-set confidence interval, validation results are illustrated via outlier percentage, which is the observed outlier amount, at each frequency line, normalized {{by the number of}} total test cases. Comparison of the UQ results among different statistical models, estimators, and noise contamination levels is presented, for the purpose of guiding users towards using optimal estimators under certain circumstance. Hypothesis tests are implemented, with statistical models available, and the detection performance is compared for different detectors, damage levels, and noise contaminations. Receiver operating characteristic curves are used for quantitative visualization of the abovementioned performance qualities. Using area under curve (AUC) metric, it is concluded how detection rates trend as damage level and signal-to-noise condition changes, suggesting optimal frequency bands for implementing detection. For example, even for heavily- contaminated cases, there is still acceptable detectability at resonances. As a decision-making problem, SHM probabilistically involves making correct decisions with acceptable (application-dependent) type-I errors. In the end of this dissertation, probability of detection for different cases and test conditions are optimized and compared, as given certain false alarm tolerance thresholds. By having optimal detections, the damage identification problems have a clearer outline with respect to different hypothesis design...|$|E

Despite the reduction in measurement time and complexity, these suffer from a number of limitations, such as problems related to the estimation <b>of</b> <b>transmissibility,</b> or the unreliability of the results due to cross coupling between path inputs, etc, which makes them prone to errors. Some of these only apply to one specific method while others are common to all transmissibility based approaches. The goal {{of this paper is to}} identify and describe these limitations and point out the potential dangers of applying such methods without taking these into account. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{important}} aspect of microparasite biology {{is the fact that}} infections are populations of thousands of microbes. As any population, infections are hence subject to two main types of changes: demographic and evolutionary. Here we analyse the consequences of within-host evolutionary changes. We build an epidemiological model where infections are regularly invaded by locally favored mutations affecting various infectious traits (virulence, transmissibility and clearance). Our results are the following. In durable infections, where within-host evolution is an important matter, a drop <b>of</b> <b>transmissibility</b> is only slightly deleterious to the infection, while a reduction of infection lifespan is very costly. In consequence, locally favored mutations reducing transmissibility reach a larger frequency, or even the complete fixation, and the suboptimality accumulated in infections owing to within-host evolution affects more their transmission than their duration. Conversely, taking an infection at random and observing the events of within-host evolution, one is more likely to observe reductions of infection length than reductions <b>of</b> <b>transmissibility,</b> because the mutations affecting transmissibility are often already present in infections. We then discuss the interpretation of these results in terms of deleterious mutations, and we also emphasize that the management of within-host evolution {{could be used as a}} novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of infection...|$|R
40|$|Variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr), a {{recently}} identified and seemingly sporadic human prion disease, {{is distinct from}} Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) but shares features of Gerstmann-Str 34 ussler-Scheinker disease (GSS). However, contrary to exclusively inherited GSS, no prion protein (PrP) gene variations have been detected in VPSPr, suggesting that VPSPr might be the long-sought sporadic form of GSS. The VPSPr atypical features raised the issue <b>of</b> <b>transmissibility,</b> a prototypical property of prion diseases. We inoculated VPSPr brain homogenate into transgenic mice expressing various levels of human PrP (PrP(C)). On first passage, 54...|$|R
