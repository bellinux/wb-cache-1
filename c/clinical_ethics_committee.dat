The <b>Clinical</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee's</b> pronouncements have an advisory function, whereas Research Ethics Committees' decisions are binding. This article analyzes the legal impact of the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committees' reports. Legal and medical reasoning share the same practical nature. Both can have several correct answers to the same situation. <b>Clinical</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committees</b> deliberate about these alternatives and analyze the involved values. Their conclusions are non-compulsory recommendations. They do not replace nor diminish the doctor's personal responsibility. Even though the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Ethics</b> Committees' reports are not binding, they constitute a sort of "expert's opinion", expressed by qualified professionals, who assume their own professional responsibility as advisors. The members' behavior is necessarily subject to constitutional and legal regulations. When judges review the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee's</b> reports, they must realize that their nature is advisory, and also consider them an essential element to reduce {{the gap between the}} medical and legal fields.

40|$|Objectives- To {{investigate}} the needfor hospital <b>clinical</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> {{by studying the}} frequency with which ethical dilemmas arose, the perceived adequacy of the process of their resolution, and the teaching and training ofstaff in medical ethics. Design- Interviews with individuals and three multidisciplinaty teams; questionnaire to randomly selected individuals. Setting- Two major London children's hospitals. Results- Ethical dilemmas arose frequently but were resolved in a relatively unstructured fashion. Ethical concerns included: the validity of consent for investigations and treatment; lack of children 's involvement in consent; initiation of heroic orfutile treatments; resource allocation. Staff expressed the needfor a forum which would provide consultation on ethical issues, develop guidelines for good ethical practice, undertake teaching and training, and provide ethical reflection outside the acute clinical setting. Conclusion- Multidisciplinaty, accountable and audited <b>clinical</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committees</b> with predominantly advisoty, practice development and educational roles could provide a valuable contribution to UK clinical practice and perhaps in other countries that have not developed hospital <b>clinical</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committees...</b>|$|R

40|$|Year] doi: 10. 1136 / medethics- 2013 - 101604 A central {{task for}} {{clinical}} ethics consultants and committees (CEC) is providing analysis of, and advice on, prospective or retrospective clinical cases. However, {{several kinds of}} biases may threaten the integrity, relevance or quality of the CEC’s deliberation. Bias should be identified and, if possible, reduced or counteracted. This paper provides a systematic classification of kinds of bias that may be present in a CEC’s case deliberation. Six kinds of bias are discussed, with examples, as to their significance and risk factors. Possible remedies are suggested. The potential for bias is greater when the case deliberation is performed by an individual ethics consultant than when an entire <b>clinical</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committee</b> is involved...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of ethics case consultation {{over the past}} 30 years, initially in North America and recently in Western Europe, has primarily {{taken place in the}} secondary or tertiary healthcare settings. The predominant model for ethics consultation, in some countries overwhelmingly so, is a hospital-based <b>clinical</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committee.</b> In the United States, accreditation boards suggest the ethics committee model as a way of meeting the ethics component of the accreditation requirement for payment by Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), and in some European countries, there are legislatory requirements or government recommendations for hospitals to have clinical ethics committees. There is no corresponding pressure for primary care services to have ethics committees or ethics consultants to advise clinicians, patients, and families on the difficult ethical decisions that arise in clinical practice...|$|E

40|$|The {{improvements}} in the obstetrical and neonatal diagnosis and therapies have resulted into {{an increase in the}} survival rate of infants previously considered as non-viable. Debate is focusing on professionals ’ behaviour about withdrawal or withholding of life sustaining treatment (LST) and administration of palliative care for newborns whose conditions are incompatible with a prolonged life. Decisions about treatment should be made jointly by the professionals’ team and the family, placing the interest of the baby {{at the very heart of}} the decision process. It is very important that the environment in which the family has to make the decision is characterized by openness, dialogue and frankness. A proper and effective communication with parents is always necessary and can resolve any conflict caused by disagreement. Furthermore, parents need time in the decision making process. Other supports, which could help the family in the final decision are the possibility to ask for a specialist’s second opinion and the involvement of religious leaders and of an indipendent <b>clinical</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committee.</b> Withholding or withdrawal of LST does not mean cessation of care for the baby, it means to change the focus of care from curative to palliative care...|$|E
40|$|The moral {{importance}} {{of telling the}} truth is recognized in both moral theory and in the practical reality of everyday living. In the context of health care, the duty of a health professional {{to be honest with}} her patient is articulated in professional codes of conduct, for example the General Medical Council (GMC) document Good Medical Practice lists in its duties of a doctor, ‘be honest and open and act with integrity’ 1 It also states. ‘share with patients, in a way they can understand, the information they want or need to know about their condition, its likely progression, and the treatment options available to them, including associated risks and uncertainties’. 1 There has been a gradual move over recent years in health care, particularly Western health care, to give more weight to patient autonomy, shared decision-making and better communication with patients. However, empirical studies continue to show that health-care professionals identify the question of truth-telling and disclosure as a source of moral and psychological discomfort in many situations. 2, 3 Clinicians may bring these dilemmas to a <b>clinical</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committee</b> for advice. In this five-minute focus I will consider the moral arguments that inform the discussion of truth-telling in health care and explore the range of contexts in which difficulties might arise...|$|E
40|$|Relatives may {{increasingly}} {{demand that}} an incompetent patient’s treatment be continued indefinitely, despite clinical advice {{that it is}} technically “futile” (offering no reasonable prospect of return to a meaningful quality of life). Third-party interventions may become a more frequent part of attempts to resolve such disputes {{where there is no}} formal advance directive. - In the Messiha case, the Supreme Court of New South Wales upheld clinical judgement regarding the patient’s best interests as most important. - In the Schiavo case in the United States, clinicians’ decisions on futility of treatment had received unwavering judicial support in more than 20 proceedings. - Political differences between the US and Australia make it unlikely clinicians in this country will face Schiavo-type legislative challenges to individual clinical decisions and the judicial rulings upholding them. - Consulting a <b>clinical</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committee</b> in such scenarios is both legally recommended and clinically warranted as an important device for diffusing tensions between relatives and clinicians, as well as clarifying their respective ethical and legal responsibilities. - In protracted or apparently irresolvable disputes with relatives, applying for a judicial declaration on futility of treatment has become a practical option for intensivists in Australia and should be a recognised part of their training. 3 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Background: Today all Norwegian {{hospital}} trusts have {{at least}} one <b>clinical</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committee</b> (CEC). Part of their mandate is to give advice and guide hospital clinicians in ethically challenging situations. We wanted to find out if clinicians who had used CEC in situations regarding individual patients found it useful and worthwhile doing. Material and methods: The local CECs were asked to forward a questionnaire to all clinicians who had discussed an individual patient case in a CEC during the foregoing 18 months. The survey was anonymous. 43 out of 86 questionnaires (50 %) were returned. Results: Most clinicians gave several reasons for contacting CEC, most common was the wish to get a broad discussion of the case. They found the deliberation to be very useful in this case. Ethical challenges related to foregoing of medical treatment for seriously ill patients (56 %), relative`s will (40 %) and patient autonomy (37 %) were most frequently discussed. CEC gave an advice in 50 % of the cases, and 38 % of the deliberations had practical consequences, for example foregoing of medical treatment in six cases. Interpretation: CEC discussions influence complicated decision-making processes. The committee-work is mostly evaluated as useful, and the deliberations often have practical consequences. A future challenge is to make CEC well known among clinicians and secure good quality...|$|E
40|$|Background:[*] Whose {{interests}} {{should a}} hospital <b>clinical</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>committee</b> (CEC) serve? This {{is a particularly}} important question in conflicts regarding life and death decisions. This question has been raised in Norway by clinicians, politicians and lay people. Method: A retrospective evaluation of six high conflict cases discussed in CECs, all dealing with forgoing life prolonging treatment to children. The information about the cases is taken from media coverage. The focus is on reasons for conflict and {{on the role of}} the CECs. The author was involved in the CEC discus-sion of four of the six cases. Findings: Parents ’ distrust in the medical judgments seemed to be an important reason why conflicts developed. In addition value conflicts were obvious, but value aspects sometimes could be covered by clinicians in medical facts. When advice was given in the CEC, they all supported the doctors ’ decision. The child’s best interest was the focus of the CEC. In only one of these cases did the CEC’s discussion seem to have had practical consequences. Conclusion: The most important function for a CEC is to secure that value issues are recognized and dealt with in a competent way. Neutrality issues cannot be ignored in the work of the CECs. Lay CEC members, open and systematic working procedures, transparency of arguments and early involvemen...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{literature}} on bioethics has begun to pose the sociological challenge of how to explore organisational processes that facilitate a systemic response to ethical concerns. The present discussion seeks {{to make a contribution}} to this important new direction in ethical research by presenting findings from an Australian pilot study. The research was initiated by the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Ethics</b> <b>Committee</b> of Redland Hospital at Bayside Health Service District in Queensland, Australia, and explores health professionals' {{understanding of the nature of}} ethics and their experience with ethical decision-making within an acute medical ward. This study focuses on the actual experience, understanding and attitudes of clinical professionals in a general medical ward. In particular, the discussion explores the specific findings from the study concerned with how a multi-disciplinary team of health professionals define and operationalise the notion of ethics in an acute ward hospital setting. The key issue reported is that health professionals are not only able to clearly articulate notions of ethics, but that the notions expressed by a multi-disciplinary diversity of participants share a common definitional concept of ethics as patient-centred care. The central finding is that all professional groups indicated that there is a guiding principle to address their ethical sense of the 'good' or the 'ought' and that is to act in a way that furthered the interests of patients and their families. The findings affirm the importance of a sociological perspective as a productive new direction in bioethical research. No Full Tex...|$|E
