However, several {{ingredients}} {{often used in}} <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> production can be contaminated with aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), which may result into milk contaminated with aflatoxin M 1. Given the number of ingredients and their amounts used {{in the production of}} <b>compound</b> <b>feed,</b> it is very costly to check every batch of ingredients for AFB 1 contamination.

In the first season only one generation of rats (F 1) was examined whereas in the second season two rat generations (F 1 and F 2) were studied.

There were however statistically significant differences in feed composition and in the physiological response of the rats between the two seasons. There were also differences in physiological response between the F 1 and F 2 generation of rats in the second season, although these animals were fed the same <b>compound</b> <b>feeds.</b> More detailed studies are required to quantify the effect of agronomic factors on the composition of crops and the physiology of rats fed on <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> prepared from these crops...|$|E

Four diets {{made up of}} 6 kg DM/day forage (Italian ryegrass (R), meadow hay (M), mixture of corn silage (C) and R or alfalfa (A) and R) and 3 kg DM/d of a <b>compound</b> <b>feed,</b> were offered in equal portions at 8. 00 and 16. 00 h to four dry, non-pregnant Friesian cows. Diets and cows were arranged in a 4 × 4 Latin Square design having experimental periods of 21 days. In each period, starting from the afternoon meal of day 11, the <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> was gradually substituted in three 1 kg increments with the same <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> supplemented with anionic salts. Interactions between type of forage and concentrate were significant for urinary pH values. Urine pH decreased at an increasing rate after anionic feed supplementation at different rates for the different of basal forage diets, with the lowest value for R and the highest for A diet. The 1 and 2 kg levels of substitutions elevated urinary C 1 and urea concentrations, but not Na and K concentrations or urine volume: thus the osmolality increased from 266 to 334 mOsm/kg. The highest level of anionic feed supplementation (3 kg) sharply changed urine output patterns with increased urine volumes from 3. 14 to 4. 63 1 / 6 h and lowered urinary Cl and urea concentrations resulting in reduced urine osmolality from 334 to 277 mOsm/kg. The anionic <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> caused a marked increase of the Ca concentration in urine, from 0. 96 to 4. 30 mmol/l, while P levels were not affected. Overall the anionic supplementation caused a progressive increase in urinary output of Cl and Ca (577 - 1085 and 2. 50 - 15. 53 mmol/ 6 h, respectively), while only {{the highest level of}} anionic <b>compound</b> <b>feed</b> resulted in significant increases in urea, Na and K outputs.

40|$|BackgroundIn the {{nutrition}} literature, {{there are several}} reports {{on the use of}} artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) approaches for predicting feed composition and nutritive value, while the use of support vector machines (SVM) method as a new alternative approach to MLR and ANN models is still not fully investigated. MethodsThe MLR, ANN, and SVM models were developed to predict metabolizable energy (ME) content of <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> for pigs based on the German energy evaluation system from analyzed contents of crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), crude fiber (CF), and starch. A total of 290 datasets from standardized digestibility studies with <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> was provided from several institutions and published papers, and ME was calculated thereon. Accuracy and precision of developed models were evaluated, given their produced prediction values. ResultsThe results revealed that the developed ANN [R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 95; root mean square error (RMSE) [*]=[*] 0. 19 [*]MJ/kg of dry matter] and SVM (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 95; RMSE[*]=[*] 0. 21 [*]MJ/kg of dry matter) models produced better prediction values in estimating ME in compound feed than those produced by conventional MLR (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 89; RMSE[*]=[*] 0. 27 [*]MJ/kg of dry matter). ConclusionThe developed ANN and SVM models produced better prediction values in estimating ME in compound feed than those produced by conventional MLR; however, there were not obvious differences between performance of ANN and SVM models. Thus, SVM model may also be considered as a promising tool for modeling the relationship between chemical composition and ME of <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> for pigs. To provide the readers and nutritionist with the easy and rapid tool, an Excel® calculator, namely, SVM_ME_pig, was created to predict the metabolizable energy values in <b>compound</b> <b>feeds</b> for pigs using developed support vector machine model...|$|E
