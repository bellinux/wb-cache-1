Before starting, {{she had the}} town's only teacher, the mayor, and the city magistrate sign a statement testifying to the time she departed from the village.

Revithi {{was not allowed to}} enter Panathinaiko Stadium—her race was stopped in Parapigmata by a few Greek military officers whom she asked to sign her handwritten report to certify her time of arrival in Athens. She stated to the reporters that she wanted to meet Timoleon Philimon (the General-Secretary of the Hellenic Olympic Committee) to present her case. Historians believe that she intended to present her documents to the Hellenic Olympic Committee in the hopes that they would recognize her achievement.

5|$|Despite the relaxed atmosphere, {{relations}} between Bligh and his men, and particularly between Bligh and Christian, continued to deteriorate. Christian was routinely humiliated by the captain—often {{in front of}} the crew and the native Tahitians—for real or imagined slackness, while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment. Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became a common occurrence; as a consequence, three men deserted the ship. They were quickly recaptured, and a search of their belongings revealed a list of names which included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh confronted the pair and accused them of complicity in the desertion plot, which they strenuously denied; without further <b>corroboration</b> Bligh could not act against them.|$|E
5|$|Ælfric {{was the son}} of an earl of Kent {{and became}} a monk of Abingdon Abbey in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). He was very likely Abbot of Abingdon before {{becoming}} Abbot of St Albans Abbey around 975, although some historians do not believe that he held the office of Abbot at Abingdon. Although the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis, or History of the Church of Abingdon, names Ælfric as abbot, the abbatial lists do not record him as such. Indirect <b>corroboration</b> of his being abbot at Abingdon is a grant of land to Ælfric personally (instead of to the office he held) while he was archbishop that had previously been unjustly taken from Abingdon. This land was to revert to Abingdon after Ælfric's death.|$|E
5|$|One of the Sinhala legends tells {{that when}} Skanda-Kumara moved to Sri Lanka, {{he asked for}} refuge from Tamils. The Tamils refused, {{and he came to}} live with the Sinhalese in Kataragama. As a penance for their refusal, the deity forced Tamils to indulge in body {{piercing}} and fire walking in his annual festival. This legend tries to explain the location of the shrine as well as the traditional patterns of worship by Tamils. Another Sinhala legends attests that Kataragama deviyo was the deity worshiped by Dutugamunu in the 1st century BCE, before his war with Ellalan, and that Dutugamunu had the shrine erected to Skanda-Kumara at Kataragama after his victory. This legend has no <b>corroboration</b> in the Mahavamsa, the historic annals about Dutugamunu. Another Sinhala legend makes Kataragama deviyo a deification of a Tamil spy sent by Elara to live amongst the Sinhalese or a Tamil juggler who made the locals deify him after his death. Yet another legend says that Kataragama deviyo is a deification of the legendary king Mahasena, who is born as a bodhisattva or Buddha in waiting. Anthropologists Richard Gombrich and Gananath Obeyesekere were able to identify new strands of these legends and the originators of these legends since the 1970s, with the burgeoning popularity of the shrine and its deity amongst the Sinhala Buddhists.|$|E

25|$|David Miller {{has criticized}} {{this kind of}} {{criticism}} by Salmon and others because it makes inductivist assumptions. Popper does not say that <b>corroboration</b> is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power is in the theory itself, not in its <b>corroboration.</b> The rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory {{is that it is}} simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind of experiment, regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, it is wrong to consider <b>corroboration</b> as a reason, a justification for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.|$|E

40|$|Kendell and Jablensky {{argue that}} {{validity}} in psychiatry requires either unique biological characteristics or {{a zone of}} rarity, where few symptoms of one syndrome are present in another syndrome. Meeting either of these criteria allows the inference that the syndrome {{is caused by a}} specific biological mechanism not present in other syndromes. Failing to meet either of these criteria means the syndrome has been arbitrarily grouped and is invalid. Kendell and Jablensky's account of validity is too restrictive. Scientific phenomena are generally produced by a multiplicity of unstable overlapping causes, the causes for one phenomenon typically also present in other phenomena. Despite this, scientific phenomena are not automatically arbitrary. Science employs idealistic models that can successfully describe phenomena produced by overlapping causes and can gain approximately true knowledge of that phenomenon. The specific biological mechanisms that Kendell and Jablensky see as delivering validity are only specific in an idealized sense. Also, approximate truth means Kendell and Jablensky are mistaken to see validity as invariant and independent of context. An alternative approach to inferring causes is the common cause and unifications. Scientists often see otherwise unrelated phenomena regularly co-occur, and this legitimizes inferring common causes responsible for the phenomena. Applied to psychiatry, I show how syndromes that cover many different unrelated phenomena allow an inference to common causes, and this delivers validity. Zones of rarity can actually decrease validity. Idealized models often produce more information about causes by covering more phenomena, whereas zones of rarity often reduce the number of symptoms covered by a syndrome. Ignoring zones of rarity in favour of syndromes that cover many symptoms can sometimes increase validity. This can also occur when validating syndromes through <b>corroborations</b> with other factors. Increasing <b>corroborations</b> may require reducing the number of symptoms, potentially reducing validity...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of whether or not the need for self-enhancement is culturally universal has been a controversial issue in cultural psychology. Though there have been numerous studies arguing that East Asians also have the need for self-enhancement, the controversy remained. We contend that the field is ready to see a cohesive theory that integrates and explains when and why East Asians do and do not manifest their need for self-enhancement. In this paper, we provide the theoretical logics of and rationales behind face and dignity cultures as the new theoretical proxies that integrate and explain East Asians 2 ̆ 7 self-enhancing behaviors, supplementing the former approach that uses the individualism-collectivism dichotomy. In particular, four representative properties of face culture — humility, public (versus private) concern, prevention regulatory focus, and harmony — are discussed to explain cross-cultural differences in the extent and ways of manifestations of self-enhancement motivation between European Americans and East Asians. Theoretical <b>corroborations</b> and empirical findings supporting this approach are also discussed...|$|R
