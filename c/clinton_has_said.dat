25|$|The {{controversy}} unfolded {{against the}} backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi. Some experts, officials, and members of Congress have contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, as well as federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping. In response, <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that her use of personal email was in compliance with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts, though not their own private email servers.|$|E
500|$|On September 21, 1996, Clinton {{signed into}} law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines {{marriage}} for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman, allowing individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages performed in other states. Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said that Clinton's signing of DOMA [...] "was a political decision that they made {{at the time of}} a re-election". In defense of his actions, <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that DOMA was an attempt to [...] "head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states", a possibility he described as highly likely {{in the context of a}} [...] "very reactionary Congress". Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, [...] "the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected." [...] Clinton himself stated that DOMA was something [...] "which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that". Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims [...] "historic revisionism". In a July 2, 2011, editorial The New York Times opined, [...] "The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments." [...] Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.|$|E
2500|$|In various interviews, <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "I did {{not send}} {{classified}} material, and I {{did not receive}} any material that was marked or designated classified."

"No, {{three is}} the price"--and I {{started for the}} stairs without waiting for any further argument, for <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> {{that that was the}} amount that the Lord would provide, {{and it seemed to me}} that it would be sacrilegious to take a penny more than was promised.|$|R
2500|$|Friends {{and colleagues}} of the <b>Clintons</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> Whitehaven <b>has</b> {{typically}} been {{reserved for the}} exclusive use of Hillary Clinton and invitations to visit the property are considered a high privilege reserved for close confidantes. Clinton used the house as a [...] "fortress of solitude" [...] while working on her book Hard Choices and has hosted important gatherings at the property with advisors.

5000|$|The guitar solo on [...] "Get Off Your Ass and Jam" [...] is uncredited, a {{practice}} that was typical of Funkadelic records of the 1970s.

5000|$|Defenders of Mrs. <b>Clinton</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that Schmidt's {{coverage}} of her {{is not fair}} {{and he has been}} frequently criticized by the group Media Matters and other liberals. After breaking the Clinton email story, Media Matters's founder and chairman, David Brock, wrote an open letter to The New York Times about the story, [...] "prominent correction as soon as possible" [...] about the story.

5000|$|In July 2007, {{watchdog}} group Judicial Watch sued the National Archives over the slow release of documents covering {{her career as}} First Lady. Almost 2 million pages of documents held at the <b>Clinton</b> Library <b>had</b> yet {{to be released from}} those years, with less than 1 percent having been released. Federal archivists stated that the process is slow due to the need to perform redactions due to the law, and likely would extend past the 2008 presidential election. <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> {{at the time of the}} library's opening in 2004 that [...] "everything's going to be available."

50|$|Gibson {{stated in}} 2014 that Clinton {{had no choice}} but to defend the {{defendant}} after she was appointed by the judge in the case.

5000|$|After {{the release}} of the Access Hollywood video, Trump's first public {{response}} {{came in the form of}} a written statement published on his campaign website: This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago.

50|$|On August 22, 2016, Boasberg {{ordered the}} release of over 14,000 emails found in the United States Department of State {{correspondence}} of Hillary Clinton by the FBI during an investigation of Clinton's private server. These emails were requested by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group, because the FBI has indicated that emails were work-related and not entirely private as <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> previously <b>said.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Clinton {{stated that}} she was {{inclined}} to support the issuance by the State Department of a cross-border permit for the Northern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline. [...] Through June 2015, she delayed announcing her position on the pipeline, noting that as Secretary of State, she had set in motion the review process {{a number of years}} previously to evaluate the pipeline, and preferred to allow time for her successor John Kerry, and President Obama to make the decision. [...] "I will refrain from commenting because I had a leading role in getting that process started," [...] <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "and I {{think that we have to}} let it run its course." [...] In September 2015, Clinton announced her opposition to Keystone. [...] The Keystone XL pipeline was officially rejected by Secretary of State Kerry and President Obama in November 2015.

50|$|David Brock {{authored}} The Real Anita Hill in 1993, {{and had a}} hand in {{many other}} political books, including examinations of Bill and Hillary <b>Clinton.</b> He <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that his previous work was lies and distortions and disavowed his previous attacks he calls a smear campaign funded by wealthy right wing groups.

5000|$|Former President Barack Obama {{and former}} United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton {{have been very}} {{supportive}} of good {{relations between the two}} countries and more cooperation on more issues more often. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has stated that U.S.-China relationship to be [...] "taken to a new level". Some experts have disagreed with the effectiveness of a G-2.

5000|$|Former Secretary of State Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "we {{should strive}} to have new {{electricity}} generation come from other sources, such as clean coal and renewables,” and former Energy Secretary Dr. Steven Chu has said that “It is absolutely worthwhile to invest in carbon capture and storage", noting {{that even if the}} U.S. and Europe turned their backs on coal, developing nations like India and China would likely not.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{concerns}} both countries have had {{is the impact of}} the dispute on foreign investment. Thomas McLarty, US envoy at the resolution talks and former aid to President Bill <b>Clinton,</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> peace is essential to South America's economic recovery. He added: [...] "You clearly cannot have long-term growth and prosperity involving foreign investment without stability". While there are still political instability issues in the region, resolution of the territorial conflict is helpful.|$|E
50|$|Another {{additional}} controversy concerned Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey, {{who sought}} a speaking slot {{at the convention}} but was not granted one. Casey complained {{that it was because}} of his outspoken pro-life views: he had warned the platform committee that Democrats were committing political suicide because of their support for abortion. <b>Clinton</b> supporters <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that Casey was not allowed to speak because he had not endorsed the ticket.|$|R
5000|$|The defense named 48 {{people it}} wanted to appear on Manning's behalf. The list was {{believed}} to include President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary <b>Clinton.</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> that the diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks [...] "did not represent significant consequences to foreign policy." [...] Obama was named because of an April 2011 statement [...] that Manning [...] "broke the law": The defense requests the presence of redacted {{in order to discuss}} the issue of Unlawful Command Influence (UCI).

2500|$|On June 22, 2015, the Benghazi panel {{released}} emails between Clinton and Sidney Blumenthal, who {{had been}} recently deposed by the committee. [...] Committee chairman Gowdy issued a press release criticizing Clinton for not providing the emails to the State Department. <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> she provided all work-related emails to the State Department, and that only emails of a personal nature on her private server were destroyed. The State Department confirmed that 10 emails and parts of five others from Sidney Blumenthal regarding Benghazi, which the Committee had made public on June 22, could not {{be located in the}} Department's records, but that the 46 other, previously unreleased Libya-related Blumenthal emails published by the Committee, were in the Department's records. In response, Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill, when asked about the discrepancy said: [...] "She has turned over 55,000 pages of materials to the State Department, including all emails in her possession from Mr. Blumenthal."

500|$|In a joint {{statement}} released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general {{of the intelligence community}} said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so {{at the time of their}} inspection and [...] "never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system." [...] They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house. Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such. After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called [...] "born classified" [...] category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server. The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department. Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails [...] "contained classified State Department information when originated." [...] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.|$|R

Of his process, he has stated that he is simply more proficient at dreaming up plots than crafting sentence after sentence.|$|R
5000|$|U.S. Secretary of State Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "The {{countries}} that threaten regional and global peace {{are the very}} places where women and girls are deprived of dignity and opportunity". She has noted that countries where women are oppressed are places where the [...] "rule of law and democracy are struggling to take root", and that, when women's rights as equals in society are upheld, the {{society as a whole}} changes and improves, which in turn enhances stability in that society, which in turn contributes to global society.|$|E

5000|$|According to Clinton, {{there is}} [...] "systemic racism in our {{criminal}} justice system." [...] She has {{expressed support for}} [...] "retraining police officers" [...] and [...] "looking at ways to end racial profiling." [...] Addressing crowds {{on the campaign trail}} in 2015 and 2016, <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> both [...] "Yes, black lives matter" [...] and [...] "all lives matter."

2500|$|<b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> also <b>said,</b> [...] "there is not {{a sexual}} relationship, an {{improper}} sexual relationship or {{any other kind of}} improper relationship" [...] which he defended as truthful on August 17, 1998 because of his use of the present tense, famously arguing [...] "it depends on what {{the meaning of the word}} 'is' is" [...] (i.e., he was not, at the time he made that statement, still in a sexual relationship with Lewinsky). Under pressure from Starr, who had obtained from Lewinsky a blue dress with Clinton's semen stain, as well as testimony from Lewinsky that the President had inserted a cigar tube into her vagina, Clinton stated, [...] "I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate." [...] <b>Clinton</b> denied <b>having</b> committed perjury because, according to Clinton, the legal definition of oral sex was not encompassed by [...] "sex" [...] per se. In addition, relying upon the definition of [...] "sexual relations" [...] as proposed by the prosecution and agreed by the defense and by Judge Susan Webber Wright, who was hearing the Paula Jones case, Clinton claimed that because certain acts were performed on him, not by him, he did not engage in sexual relations. Lewinsky's testimony to the Starr Commission, however, contradicted Clinton's claim of being totally passive in their encounters.|$|R
2500|$|The album's [...] "most startling" [...] {{song was}} {{considered}} [...] "What About," [...] in which Jackson violently confronts domestic abuse. Jackson stated, [...] "I think it's important to let others know that {{certain things that}} you may have experienced in your life, and that they're not alone, and that you understand what they're going through, and that they can make it through." [...] Joel Lyans included it among [...] "The New Soundtrack of Social Consciousness," [...] writing, [...] "Here, Janet does what she does best: demonstrates a coy and shy demeanor before ripping into a confident and empowered voice for those who are afraid to speak up and speak out about a situation that plagues millions of women." [...] Several media reports related its theme with President Bill Clinton's infidelity to Hillary Clinton with Monica Lewinsky. Jackson clarified it to be about her own experience, saying, [...] "President <b>Clinton?</b> People <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that to me. They say 'this is his song'," [...] comparing the situation with her song [...] "This Time" [...] inaccurately related to O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson due to its subject matter.|$|R
500|$|Federal {{funding for}} medical {{research}} involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment by Congress and {{the signature of}} President Bill <b>Clinton.</b> Bush <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. However, Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research. On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing [...] "lines" [...] of stem cells, but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines. On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power {{for the first time}} in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The bill would have repealed the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo.|$|R
