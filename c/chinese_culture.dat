5|$|Han <b>Chinese</b> <b>culture</b> percolated {{into the}} newly conquered territories and the conquered Baiyue and Dian tribes were {{eventually}} assimilated or {{displaced by the}} Han Empire. Han dynasty influences are apparent in artifacts excavated in the Baiyue tombs of modern southern China. This sphere of influence eventually extended to various ancient Southeast Asian kingdoms, where contact led {{to the spread of}} Han <b>Chinese</b> <b>culture,</b> trade and political diplomacy. The increased demand for Chinese silk also led to the establishment of the Silk Road trade routes connecting Ancient Europe, the Near East, and China.|$|E
5|$|Choe's diary {{accounts}} of his travels in China became widely {{printed in the}} 16th century in both Korea and Japan. Modern historians also refer to his written works, since his travel diary provides a unique outsider's perspective on <b>Chinese</b> <b>culture</b> in the 15th century and valuable information on China's cities and regional differences. The attitudes and opinions expressed in his writing represent in part the standpoints and views of the 15th century Confucian Korean literati, who viewed <b>Chinese</b> <b>culture</b> as compatible with and similar to their own. His description of cities, people, customs, cuisines, and maritime commerce along China's Grand Canal provides insight into the daily life of China and how it differed between northern and southern China during the 15th century.|$|E

40|$|<b>Chinese</b> {{traditional}} <b>culture,</b> {{especially for}} Confucianism, {{had long since}} been eclipsed educationally and politically [...] -largely replaced by Western-style learning in {{the first decades of}} the century and then, post- 1949, by a Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist ideology and curriculum in the schools. More and more emphasizing <b>Chinese</b> traditional <b>culture</b> in the official curriculum, we seem to overlook hidden curricula’s role in transmitting <b>Chinese</b> traditional <b>culture.</b> The purpose of this research is to investigate students’ perceptions and attitudes towards <b>Chinese</b> traditional <b>culture</b> and the relationships on hidden curricula and <b>Chinese</b> traditional <b>culture’s</b> transmitting, especially for Confucianism, in upper secondary schools in Xiamen. Multiple sources of evidence –questionnaire survey, interview, and direct observation with methodological triangulation are adopted in the thesis. And, a half-month fieldwork in Xiamen, China has been conducted. Through the surveys done for this thesis, it is evident that students in Xiamen possess the high feeling of identity and enthusiasm with <b>Chinese</b> traditional <b>culture</b> but quite a low cognitive level with <b>Chinese</b> traditional <b>culture.</b> The research serves as an initial effort to provide empirical support for the conceptualization of hidden curricula as an important ground to preserve <b>Chinese</b> traditional <b>culture.</b> The findings provide confirmation that the preservation of <b>Chinese</b> traditional <b>culture</b> in the school attributes associated with the hidden curricula constructs (physical environment, social environment, and cognitive environment). The researches on relationships between hidden curricula and the preservation of <b>Chinese</b> traditional <b>culture</b> in upper secondary schools under the new historical conditions are a whole new perspective in China, and would promote governments, schools, and families working together on the utilization of hidden curricula, to take the essence and discard the dross of <b>Chinese</b> traditional <b>culture,</b> and reconcile the contradiction between modern school and <b>Chinese</b> traditional <b>culture...</b>|$|R
