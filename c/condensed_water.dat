However, in many cases, the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a <b>condensed</b> <b>water</b> phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E
5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The <b>condensed</b> <b>water</b> is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E

2500|$|In {{oxy-fuel}} combustion the fuel is burned in oxygen instead of air.

2500|$|The main {{condenser}} {{is a large}} cross-flow tube-and-shell {{heat exchanger}} that takes wet vapor, a mixture of liquid water and steam at saturation conditions, from the turbine-generator exhaust and condenses it back into subcooled liquid water {{so it can be}} pumped back to the reactor by the condensate and feedwater pumps. [...] This condensing process is accomplished by allowing the wet vapor turbine exhaust to come into contact with thousands of tubes that have much colder water flowing through them on the other side. [...] The cooling water will typically come from a natural body of water such as a river or lake. [...] Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, located in the desert about 60 miles west of Phoenix, Arizona, is the only nuclear facility that does not use a natural body of water for cooling, instead using treated sewage from the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. [...] The cross-flow aspect of a typical main condenser means the two fluids that are exchanging heat, turbine exhaust and the cold water from a river or other water source, are flowing in perpendicular directions. [...] This is extremely effective at allowing for phase separation, that is, the heavier, <b>condensed</b> <b>water</b> falls off of the condenser tubes into the condenser hotwell found {{at the bottom of the}} heat exchanger and awaits its turn to be pumped. [...] The water coming from the cooling body of water is either pumped back to the water source at a warmer temperature or returns to a cooling tower where it either cools for more uses or evaporates into water vapor that rises out the top of the tower.|$|E

The intent of the program was to develop a condensing design that minimized the large initial cost premium associated with traditional <b>condensing</b> <b>water</b> heater designs. Equally important was that the considered approach utilizes design and construction methods that deliver the desired efficiency without compromising product reliability. Standard <b>condensing</b> <b>water</b> heater approaches in the marketplace utilize high cost materials such as stainless steel tanks and heat exchangers as well as expensive burner systems to achieve the higher efficiencies. The key in this program was to develop a water heater design that uses low-cost, available components and technologies to achieve higher efficiency at a modest cost premium. By doing this, the design can reduce the payback to a more reasonable length, increasing the appeal of the product to the marketplace. <b>Condensing</b> <b>water</b> heaters have been in existence for years, but {{have not been able to}} significantly penetrate the market. The issue has typically been cost. The high purchase price associated with existing <b>condensing</b> <b>water</b> heaters, sometimes as much as $ 2000, has been a very difficult hurdle to overcome in the marketplace. The design developed under this program has the potential to reduce the purchase price of this condensing design by as much as $ 1000 as compared to traditional condensing units. The <b>condensing</b> <b>water</b> heater design developed over the course of this program led to an approach that delivered the following performance attributes: 90 %+ thermal efficiency; 76, 000 Btu/hr input rate in a 50 gallon tank; First hour rating greater than 180 gph; Rapid recovery time; and Overall operating condition well matched to combination heat and hot water applications. Over the final three years of the program, TIAX worked very closely with A. O. Smith Water Products Company as our commercial partner to optimize the design for manufacturing.
