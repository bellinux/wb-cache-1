5|$|Power is {{supplied}} to the chip in 1.7 microsecond pulses {{as determined by}} the storage time of a control transistor. An oscillator clock operating at 200 kilohertz during calculations and dropping to 15 kilohertz between each operation means shut off time ranges from 3.3 microseconds during calculations to over 65 microseconds between. The device relies on the capacitance of the chips to store information when there is no power, and 1.7 microseconds proved sufficient for the chip to carry out a single <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>state</b> of the electronics. Any calculation can be done in 1000 such changes. This had the effect of extending battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small hearing aid batteries, equivalent to about four months of normal usage.|$|E

Although she played in every match in her first season, she was {{shielded}} from much of the action and made only six runs. Ebsary was selected in every match in her first three seasons, but in that time, scored only 136 runs at a batting average of 8.50 and took 13 wickets from 24 matches. The following year, Ebsary raised her career average above 10 {{for the first time and}} was selected in the Australian Under-23 team. In 2004–05 she made more than 100 runs in a season for the first time, and the following year she made 149 runs at 29.80. In 2006–07, she struggled and totalled only 101 runs at 14.42 and took three wickets, and after the season she transferred to Western Australia. The <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>state</b> yielded dividends in the 2007–08 season, as she made 236 runs and took eight wickets, her highest aggregate of runs and wickets in one tournament.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{research}} study investigating the effect of three cognitive variables on students’ understanding of the particulate nature of matter and its <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>state.</b> The three cognitive variables are the following: formal reasoning (FR), field dependence/independence (FDI) and convergent/divergent thinking (CD). The {{study was conducted with}} the participation of 329 ninth-grade junior high school Greek pupils in the prefecture of Fthiotida, in central Greece. In {{the first part of the}} study, the three cognitive variables as well as other variables assessing understanding of the particulate nature of matter were used as independent variables, while variables assessing understanding of the particulate nature of matter and understanding <b>of</b> the <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>state</b> were used as dependent ones. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated and a number of stepwise linear regression analyses, ANOVA and ANCOVA were performed to investigate the effects. By means of the above, the following were found: a) the three cognitive variables are significant predictors of students’ understanding the particulate nature of matter and its <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>state.</b> Among the three predictors, FR was by far the best. b) Students’ understanding of the particulate nature of matter along with the three cognitive variables has a significant effect on understanding the <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>state.</b> Since the effects of the cognitive variables were direct on the dependent variables assessing understanding the <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>state</b> or indirect through the variables assessing understanding of the particulate nature of matter, path analyses were implemented to depict such relationships. In the second part of the study the effect of the three cognitive variables on the odds of getting specific students’ ideas concerning the particulate nature of matter and its <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>state</b> was investigated by means of logistic regression analysis. The results showed that, in general, formal reasoning, divergent thinking and field independence favor the compatible with the scientific views students’ ideas while they have an unfavorable effect on their misconceptions. Among the three cognitive variables, FR was found to be the dominating one. Moreover, a principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on the instrument implemented in this study and the extracted components were discussed and compared with the variables determined on a conceptual basis...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this study, students' {{understanding}} {{of the structure of}} matter and its <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>state,</b> such as, melting, evaporation, boiling and condensation was investigated in relation to three cognitive variables: logical thinking, field-dependence/field-independence and convergence/divergence dimension.
