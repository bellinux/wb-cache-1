The test statistic is a function of the characteristic roots of the sample covariance matrix of a linear transformation of the cointegral vector; the latter is obtained from unrestricted estimator of the underlying parameters of the VAR. It is further shown that this test procedure is also applicable to the case where the I(1) process is a MIMA(k), i. e. a multivariate integrated moving average process, the moving average being of order k < ∞.

The corrosion behavior of the composites were analyzed using AC Gill potentiostat with 3. 5 wt % NaCl medium. Four factor, five level, central composite, rotatable design matrix is used to optimize the required number of experiments. The mathematical models were developed by the response surface method (RSM). The developed models have been checked for their adequacy and significance by the F-test and t-test, respectively.

40|$|Using Near Infrared (NIR) and Raman {{spectroscopy}} as PAT tools, 3 critical quality {{attributes of}} a silicone-based drug reservoir were studied. First, the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) homogeneity in the reservoir was evaluated using Raman spectroscopy (mapping) : the API distribution within the industrial drug reservoirs {{was found to}} be homogeneous while API aggregates were detected in laboratory scale samples manufactured with a non optimal mixing process. Second, the crosslinking process of the reservoirs was monitored at different temperatures with NIR spectroscopy. Conformity tests and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were performed on the collected data to find out the relation between the temperature and the time necessary to reach the crosslinking endpoints. An agreement was found between the <b>conformity</b> <b>test</b> results and the PCA results. Compared to the <b>conformity</b> <b>test</b> method, PCA had the advantage to discriminate the heating effect from the crosslinking effect occurring together during the monitored process. Therefore the 2 approaches were found to be complementary. Third, based on the HPLC reference method, a NIR model able to quantify the API in the drug reservoir was developed and thoroughly validated. Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression on the calibration set was performed to build prediction models of which the ability to quantify accurately was tested with the external validation set. The 1. 2 % RMSEP of the NIR model indicated the global accuracy of the model. The accuracy profile based on tolerance intervals was used to generate a complete validation report. The 95 % tolerance interval calculated on the validation results indicated that each future result will have a relative error below ± 5 % with a probability of at least 95 %. In conclusion, 3 critical quality attributes of silicone-based drug reservoirs were quickly and efficiently evaluated by NIR and Raman spectroscopy. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Reliable {{compliance}} {{information of}} quantitative Earth Observation products {{is a prerequisite}} for the usage of satellite-derived evidence in 1) regulatory initiatives dealing with climate and environment-relevant matters (among others), and 2) liability debates between customers and providers of value-added (quantitative) EO products. In this contribution the quality objectives compiled by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) for a series of biophysical essential climate variables (ECVs) are investigated {{from the point of view}} of <b>conformity</b> <b>testing</b> as used in legal metrology. Unlike current validation efforts, <b>conformity</b> <b>testing</b> requires that the maximum permissible uncertainty of the candidate and reference ECV estimates does not exceed a predefined fraction of the applicable tolerance interval. Given that the GCOS accuracy criterion is defined with respect to a local reference it is the uncertainty of both the in situ and the satellite ECV estimates that matter. Our findings suggest that, 1) current GCOS quality objectives must be complemented before they may serve as quality requirements for <b>conformity</b> <b>testing,</b> 2) a consensus on the choice of decision rule must be sought (between data providers and users) since this has a direct impact on what is deemed compliant, and 3) the uncertainty associated with current field validation methods for biophysical ECVs is unlikely to meet the ISO- 13528 criteria. The latter thus challenges the eligibility of current field validation methods to provide the reference needed in efforts assessing the GCOS conformity of third party datasets. JRC.

40|$|The Occupational {{preferences}} {{of a sample}} of undergraduate science students from two Colleges in London were explored {{by means of an}} Occupational Preferences Questionnaire. The study was intended to explore the relation of the preference for Research or Non-Research Occupations to other dimensions of Psychological relevance: Intelligence, Personality Factors, Values,Orientations to work satisfaction and Conformity. A classification of occupations in Science, according to the Research - Non-Research criterion was obtained by means of a Principal Components Analysis. Persons who preferred the Research Occupations tended to be more reserved, detached, critical and cool, rather than easy-going persons; to like things or words rather than dealing with people, to enjoy working alone {{but at the same time}} liking intellectual companionship and to be self-sufficient rather than group-dependent and accustomed to making their own decisions. The mean personality profile (l 6 P. F.) for those who preferred the Research Occupations was found to be very similar to the "Typical Profile" of the research scientists. However, no very strong differences in personality factors were found between those who preferred research occupations and those who preferred other occupations. The main difference between these groups was on their conformity scores as measured by a <b>conformity</b> <b>test</b> developed by the researcher. Thus, those who preferred research occupations scored significantly lower inconformity than those who liked teaching, administration, sales, etc. Refinement of the <b>Conformity</b> <b>Test</b> is suggested as it may be a useful instrument in selection procedures. The general pattern of occupational values expressed by this sample was found to be similar to those reported for College Students in previous literature. Persons who preferred Research Occupations valued the interest of the work most highly while those who had other occupational preferences placed a higher value on meeting or working with people. <p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{processes}} of the production chain of carbide inserts, such as unloading or packaging, the <b>conformity</b> <b>test</b> of the insert type is performed manually, which causes a statistic increase of errors due to monotony and fatigue of workers {{as well as the}} wide variety of insert types. A measuring method is introduced that automatically inspects the chipformer geometry, the most significant quality feature of inserts. The proposed recognition approach is based on local energy model of feature perception and concatenates the phase congruency in terms of local filter orientations into a compact spatial histogram. This method has been tested on several inserts of different types. Test results show that prevalent insert types can be inspected and classified robustly under illumination variations.

40|$|A Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{system is}} a {{wireless}} network composed of a reader which tries to communicate with and read (identify) a subset of tags from among a larger population. There are several standards defined {{for this type of}} network including the EPCGlobal UHF Class 1 Gen 2 RFID standard which is the focus of this work. The increasing number of tag and reader manufacturers necessitates the design of standard <b>conformity</b> <b>tests.</b> To create <b>conformity</b> <b>tests</b> one needs to know the possible states and transitions between states that the tags may experience. In this work a tag is modeled as a state transition machine where the tag transitions from one state to another upon receiving commands from the reader. The model is Markovian; i. e., each transition only depends on the current state and the received command and is independent of the previous transitions, states and commands. The contribution of this work is to fully define the transitions of this model such that it conforms to the specification of the EPCGlobal standard. This, in turn, is necessary for the design of a <b>conformity</b> <b>testing</b> methodology. Considering all the configurations of the internal tag parameters and command parameters yields a state transition machine with 449 unique states and 141 unique commands. For each unique command there is one unique transition out of each state; thus, there are 63, 309 unique transitions that need to be considered. The transition machine has been expressed as a table which has states as rows, commands as columns and the future states as the table entries. This table has been automatically filled using roughly 3000 lines of MATLAB code. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) has also been developed to test and verify the transitions...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in the Logistic Engineering field are expanding the range of analysis for Operational Availability (Ao) from purely statistical models to include prognostic models. A necessary step in order to perform prognostic analysis {{is the study of}} system's components degradations. The degradation of a component is a case by case study, which characteristics that change significantly even inside the same component macro area (software, composites, mechanical parts etc.). The degradation models project over time the key factors of each component, eventually ending with the component failure (exceptions can be made for software). For those models the initial degradation state is an heavily influencing factor. Assuming that a component starts it's degradation process from a pristine state, relative to the value for which it is tested and conformed, introduces an error in the Remaining Useful Life assessment. Components used in systems have varying degrees of degradation at the t 0 of the system, which may be greater or lesser than the assumed value.

30|$|Being a {{real-time}} distributed system, ERTMS can {{be considered}} as complex industrial system. It also uses a great number of actors and, as it is a railway signalling system, it must comply with very strict safety constraints. It is then necessary to check and validate the ERTMS system in order to give confidence to all parts [17]. These checking activities suggest various techniques such as: static analysis, model checking, and <b>conformity</b> <b>test.</b> Conformity tests verify if an implementation satisfies the behaviour described in the specification. This method detects the errors of implementation by performing sequences of actions; in order to determine whether system behaviours are those initially specified. This type of test was developed for the validation of communication protocols [29]. Conformity tests have three steps: (1) the derivation of tests scenarios which aims to generate abstract test scenarios {{on the basis of the}} protocol specification, (2) allows the implementation of test scenarios in order to make them executable for a particular implementation, and (3) apply the implemented test scenarios in order to determine the conformity verdict.|$|E
40|$|Conformity {{refers to}} the act of {{changing}} one’s behaviour to match that of others. Recent studies in humans have shown that individual differences exist in conformity and that these differences are related to differences in neuronal activity. To understand the neuronal mechanisms in more detail, animal tests to assess conformity are needed. Here, we used a test of conformity in rats that has previously been evaluated in female, but not male, rats and assessed the nature of individual differences in conformity. Male Wistar rats were {{given the opportunity to}} learn that two diets differed in palatability. They were subsequently exposed to a demonstrator that had consumed the less palatable food. Thereafter, they were exposed to the same diets again. Just like female rats, male rats decreased their preference for the more palatable food after interaction with demonstrator rats that had eaten the less palatable food. Individual differences existed for this shift, which were only weakly related to an interaction between their own initial preference and the amount consumed by the demonstrator rat.

This phase allowed the identification of limiting factors associated with scaling-up, with respect in particular to the scale of mass production required to meet the needs of planters and to the problem of ensuring genetic fidelity in the regenerated plant material.
