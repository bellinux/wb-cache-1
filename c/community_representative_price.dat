40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the views of <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> {{participating}} in a large health service in Australia. Cross-sectional survey of 49 <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> and interviews with a purposeful sample of representatives (n = 10) and staff (n = 19). Most <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> had positive attitudes about their value and potential for influence, citing concrete examples of impact. Having an external network or group was related to their beliefs in their ability to add value to their health service. <b>Community</b> <b>representatives</b> largely agreed they provided a link to, and represented, the wider community although most thought staff did not understand their role or how to work with them. Some staff questioned representativeness of their <b>community</b> <b>representatives.</b> Improving <b>community</b> participation is argued to be important in delivering better healthcare services, but effective engagement and representation at the local level is often challenging. Focusing on <b>community</b> <b>representative</b> views takes us beyond debates around representativeness to identify practical strategies to improve practice. The authors recommend health services recruit consumers with strong links to networks in the community, provide a structured and supported program, and improve staff understanding of the range of possible roles for <b>community</b> <b>representatives.</b> Local examples of community representatives' impact on policy and practice should be widely communicated. In giving prominence to the views of consumers using triangulated methods, the authors found most could report with clarity what their role was and how they impacted at their local health service. 17 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective To {{collaborate}} with consumer and <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> in the Alcohol and Pregnancy Project from 2006 - 2008 [URL] and evaluate researchers' and consumer and community representatives' {{perceptions of the}} process, context and impact of consumer and community participation in the project. Methods We formed two reference groups and sought consumer and community representatives' perspectives on {{all aspects of the}} project over a three year period. We developed an evaluation framework and asked consumer and <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> and researchers to complete a self-administered questionnaire {{at the end of the}} project. Results Fifteen researchers (93. 8 %) and seven (53. 8 %) consumer and <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> completed a questionnaire. Most consumer and <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> agreed that the process and context measures of their participation had been achieved. Both researchers and consumer and <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> identified areas for improvement and offered suggestions how these could be improved for future research. Researchers thought consumer and community participation contributed to project outputs and outcomes by enhancing scientific and ethical standards, providing legitimacy and authority, and increasing the project's credibility and participation. They saw it was fundamental to the research process and acknowledged consumer and <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> for their excellent contribution. Consumer and <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> were able to directly influence decisions about the research. They thought that consumer and community participation had significant influence on the success of project outputs and outcomes. Conclusions Consumer and community participation is an essential component of good research practice and contributed to the Alcohol and Pregnancy Project by enhancing research processes, outputs and outcomes, and this participation was valued by <b>community</b> and consumer <b>representatives</b> and researchers. The National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia expects researchers to work in partnership and involve consumer and <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> in health and medical research, and to evaluate community and consumer participation. It is important to demonstrate whether consumer and community participation makes a difference to health and medical research. </p...|$|R

It presents interview findings of offenders’ perceptions of justice of a sentencing process that involves the participation of Elders and <b>Community</b> <b>Representatives,</b> as moral and cultural guides. This study concludes that the vast majority of interview participants found an Indigenous sentencing court process is fairer than a mainstream sentencing court process despite the fact that it is more challenging and confronting facing Elders and <b>Community</b> <b>Representatives</b> when being sentenced for an IPV offence. Their respect for Elders and <b>Community</b> <b>Representatives,</b> and the respect afforded to Elders and <b>Community</b> <b>Representatives</b> by the mainstream criminal justice system created a forum that both ‘shamed’ and supported the offenders in ways that reflected cultural values and norms...|$|R

For this, we organized a field experiment in which community members contributed to a collective effort to attract aid. We find that devolving aid distribution to <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> increases the aid attracted, but that this benefits <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> only. At the same time, however, <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> do take fairness considerations into account. They give higher aid shares to poorer community members and lower shares to low contributors. Moreover, representatives with lower relative wealth or who contribute relatively more keep higher aid shares...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{studies of}} {{community}} participation in health services commonly tie effectiveness {{to the perceived}} legitimacy of <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> among health staff. This article examines the underlying assumption that legitimacy is the major pathway to influence for <b>community</b> <b>representatives.</b> It takes a different vantage point from previous research in its examination of data (primarily through 34 in-depth interviews, observation and recording of 26 meetings and other interactions documented in field notes) from a 3 -year study of community representatives' action in a large health region in Australia. The analysis primarily deploys Michel de Certeau's ideas of Strategy and Tactic to understand the action and effects of the generally 'weaker players' in the spaces and places dominated by powerful institutions. Through this lens, {{we can see the}} points where <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> are active participants following their own agenda, tactically capitalising on cracks in the armour of the health service to seize opportunities that present themselves in time to effect change. Being able to see <b>community</b> <b>representatives</b> as active producers of change, not simply passengers following the path of the health service, challenges how we view the success of community participation in health. 18 page(s...|$|R
