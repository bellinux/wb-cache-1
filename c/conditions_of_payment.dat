40|$|This thesis investigates how {{competition}} {{effects in}} government procurement auction {{are affected by}} the risk distribution between the procurer and the winning bidder. The risk distribution is linked to the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> which is assumed to be largely determined by the procurer. Thus, by investigating whether competition effects are different dependent on the risk distribution, this thesis contributes to the previous literature which almost exclusively model competition effects to be determined exogenous sources of uncertainty and characteristics of the market. There is a previous literature on the effects of various payment conditions in auctions but it mostly considers ex post moral hazard issues, and not effects on the competitive behavior at the bidding stage. An econometric analysis is conducted on auctions of infrastructure construction contracts held by the Swedish Transport Administration between 2010 and 2013. The results suggest that the choice of risk distribution can shift an auction from having no competition effects in bidding to strong bid-reducing competition effects. Seemingly, the procurer appears to face a trade-off between avoiding risk and enjoying bid-reducing competition effects. The difference in competition effects between contracts with fixed and more flexible payment conditions is found to increase with the auctioned project’s expected duration. In terms of government procurement policy, the results suggest that it can be cost-efficient for the procuring entity to share the risk with the contractor in risky projects instead of avoiding risk with fixed price contracts. Whilst this may contradict some common notions regarding government procurement, it is in line with the wide use of flexible payment conditions in private-sector procurement. Arguably, the recent decade’s increased ambitions regarding innovation and sustainability in government procurement adds even further weight to these policy considerations for the risk management of procurers...|$|E
40|$|This report, {{presents}} {{an examination of}} the conflict between The EU Single Market and The Danish Collective Agreement Model. Central to the field of examination, have been the Laval-verdict, ruled by the European Court of Justice in 2007. This was ruled on the backdrop of a dispute, regarding whether or not voluntarily inbound collective agreements, must be abided by foreign employers equally to the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> and hiring conditions set by law. Critical realism as our theory of science has been our guideline in the project. We use the verdict on the empirical level. Through a qualitative document analysis founded in our theoretical apparatus, we seek to uncover the underlying structures in the conflict between The EU Single Market and The Danish Collective Agreement Model, which is positioned in the deep domain, according to critical realism. Our analysis is interdisciplinarily grounded in both the paradigms of the first and second modern by Ulrich Beck and a political perspective through a dialectic interaction between integration theory and historical institutionalism. The two political theories complements each other in their use of concepts. The interdisciplinarity strengthens the analysis and gives us a more nuanced view of the conflict. The examination of the conflict has been designed as a case study of the Laval-case. Composing the report, we have conducted an analysis of the Laval-case document. This is fundamental for our analysis, intending to study how The Danish Collective Agreement Model has been challenged by The EU Single Market. We have reached to the conclusion that The Danish Collective Agreement Model is conflicted by the free movement of the EU Single Market. Since the path dependency of The Agreement Model, is embedded in the political community of the Danish nationstate. According to Beck this path dependency is founded in the first modern paradigm, whereas The EU Single Market represents the globalization of the second modern paradigm, through the European political community which is subjugated to its own path dependency. The Laval-case then becomes a critical juncture for the agreement model, when EU, through its sentence, narrow down the settings, which the national political communities can act within. Therefore the agreement model has been modified with new law. We have deduced, that The EU Single Market is an expression for the path dependency of the EU, supplemented by European Court of Justice, which in the future is expected to cultivate spill-over, through the Court’s interpretation of which conditions The EU Single Market, as an economic community, needs in order to strengthen the integration within the EU...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{consider}} the reason that the system of Uneme was stopped in 807 (the second of Daido). This theme has been thought that Fujiwara-no-Kusuko who was favored by the emperor Heizei, and her jealousy and scorn for Uneme accounted for the stop of the system of Uneme. In this way, former studies pay attention to internal conditions of Inner Palaces. In this article, I considered the background of stopping the system by paying attention to the whole system of Uneme. To put it concretely, I considered the relation of Uneme to her home town, the background of former changes of system, tasks of Uneme, and tendencies of policies at this time. About the relation of Uneme to her home town, I took production and transportation of Uneme no yomotsu as an object of study. People who live in country where offered Uneme shouldered these burdens. Before 807, the system of Uneme has changed. Reasons of these change were burdens of Uneme no yomotsu and the situation of the country. For example, in 722 (the sixth of Yoro), the system of Uneme was stopped by rebellion of Emishi and exemption of Yomotsu. Uneme worked at Moitori no tsukasa and Kashiwade no tsukasa. Except these offices, they worked as Nyoju or superior woman officer. Like these Uneme informed man officer to intentions of the emperor. That contents contained things which were related to the emperor's daily life. About policies at this time, I considered them toward districts and officers. At this time, conditions of impoverishment in districts were informed the Imperial Court by Kansatsushi. Moreover, the payment of tax wasn't smooth from the Enryaku period. On these points, offering Uneme was stopped by impoverishment and <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> of tax and Yomotsu. About officer's policies, I paid attention to annexation of Uneme no tsukasa and Nuidonoryo. These officer's jobs were similar. Therefore, I think that the {{purpose of this}} annexation was to gather rating of woman officer. The article ordering to stop the system in 807, show that the object of this intended for all Uneme(Uneme, Nyoju and superior woman officer who are from Uneme), and Uneme intended by this order wasn't treated as Uneme after this. Thus we can see that the reason for the stop of the system of offering Uneme is to reduce regional people's burdens, and to dissolve conditions which there were Nyoju and superior woman officer from Uneme. Moreover, we can see that there were two changes which Uneme's jobs were restricted to Moitori no tsukasa and Kashiwade no tsukasa, and which Nyoju and superior woman officer from Uneme weren't treated as Uneme...|$|E
