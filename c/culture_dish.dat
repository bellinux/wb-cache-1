2500|$|Infected human {{red blood}} cells are {{incubated}} in a <b>culture</b> <b>dish</b> or flask at 37°C together with a nutrient medium and plasma, serum or serum substitutes. A special feature of the incubation is the special gas mixture of mostly nitrogen (93% nitrogen, 4% carbondioxide, [...] 3% oxygen) allowing the parasites to grow at 37°C in a cell incubator. An alternative to gasing the cultures with the exact gas mixture, {{is the use of}} a candlejar. The candlejar is an airtight container in which the cultures and a lit candle are placed. The burning candle consumes some of the oxygen and produces carbon dioxide (...) , which acts as a fire extinguisher. Carbon dioxide content in fresh air varies between 0.036% and 0.039%, at an app. 5% [...] concentration the candle stops burning. The number of parasites increased by a factor 5 approximately every 48 hours (= one cycle). The parasitemia can be determined via blood film, to keep it within the wanted limits, the culture can be thinned out with healthy {{red blood cells}}.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although rare, {{microbial}} contamination of <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> occasionally occurs in our IVF/ICSI programme. Despite stringent culture {{conditions and the}} use of medium containing penicillin and streptomycin, an increasing number of infections was observed once they were routinely recorded. In this study, 95 cases of contami-nated <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> were examined, in an attempt to identify possible causes. METHODS: Relevant data of the IVF/ ICSI treatment cycles and the micro-organisms isolated from the infected <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> were evaluated retrospec-tively. RESULTS: Infections were observed only in IVF <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> and never after applying intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection. Identification of the contaminating micro-organisms showed that infections were mainly caused by Escherichia coli (n 5 56; 58. 9 %) and Candida species (n 5 24; 25. 3 %). Of the E. coli strains isolated, 41 (73. 2 %) appeared to be resistant to both antibiotics used in the culture medium and 13 (23. 2 %) appeared to resist either penicillin or streptomycin. Of all bacterial strains isolated, the resistances were 61. 4 % to both and 30 % to one of the antibiotics used. CONCLUSIONS: Applying the ICSI procedure prevents colonization of the <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> by micro-organisms. Infections in IVF <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> are mainly caused by bacterial strains insensitive to the antibiotics used or due to yeast colonization by Candida species which frequently reside in the vagina...|$|R

40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) of articular cartilage has several functions that {{are unique to}} joints. Although a technique for transplanting cultured chondrocytes has already been introduced, {{it is difficult to}} collect intact ECM when using enzymes to harvest samples. Temperature-responsive <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> have already been clinically applied in the fields of myocardial and corneal transplantation. Earlier studies have shown that a sheet of cultured cells with intact ECM and adhesive factors can be harvested using such <b>culture</b> <b>dishes,</b> which allow the surface properties of the dish to be reversibly altered by changing the temperature. Human chondrocytes were subjected to enzymatic digestion and then were seeded in temperature-responsive <b>culture</b> <b>dishes.</b> A sheet of chondrocytes was harvested by only reducing the temperature after the cultured cells reached confluency. A real-time PCR analysis of the chondrocyte sheets confirmed that type II collagen, aggrecan, and fibronectin were present. These results suggested that, although chondrocytes undergo dedifferentiation in a monolayer culture, multilayer chondrocyte sheets grown in a similar environment to that of three-dimensional culture may be able to maintain a normal phenotype. A histological examination suggested that multilayer chondrocyte sheets could thus prevent the loss of proteoglycans because the area covered by the sheets was well stained by safranin-O. The present experiments suggested that temperature-responsive <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> are useful for obtaining cultured chondrocytes, which may then be clinically employed as a substitute for periosteal patches because such sheets can be applied without a scaffold...|$|R

However, increasingly {{it has been}} observed that mimicking natural tissue properties (such as chemistry, three-dimensional structure, mechanical properties, etc) in vitro can lead to a better correlation of in vitro to in vivo cellular functions. The following studies compared traditional NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts’ functions on XanoMatrix scaffolds to standard tissue culture polystyrene. Results found significantly greater fibroblast adhesion and proliferation on XanoMatrix cell <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> which mimic the nanoscale geometry of natural tissue fibers with true, tortuous fiber beds creating a robust, consistent, and versatile growth platform.

50|$|Another {{technique}} automates {{the positioning}} of patch clamping cells in cultures. It uses a nanopipette on a precise, piezo-actuated stage to scan a surface within a <b>culture</b> <b>dish.</b> As it scans, it maintains a constant electrical capacitance between {{the tip of}} the pipette and the surface or cells beneath it by moving it up and down. (As it moves close to a cell, the capacitance increases, so the actuator moves the pipette away, and vice versa.)

40|$|Fluid and {{electrolyte}} transport by {{epithelial cells}} in vitro can {{be recognized by}} the ability of cultured cells to form domes and by the electrical properties of monolayer cultures. Pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells {{are thought to be}} partially responsible for fluid movement in the fetal lung, but their role in electrolyte transport in the adult lung is not known. We isolated alveolar type II cells from adult rat lung and maintained them on plastic <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> alone, on plastic <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> coated with an extracellular matrix, and on collagen-coated Millipore filters. Numerous large domes were formed on <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> coated with the extracellular matrix; smaller domes were formed on uncoated plastic <b>culture</b> <b>dishes.</b> Sodium butyrate (3 mM) stimulated dome formation. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the epithelial cells had flattened but still retained lamellar inclusions and that the cells were polarized with microvilli on the apical surface facing the culture medium. The electrical properties of the monolayers maintained on collagen-coated Millipore filters were tested in two laboratories. The transepithelial potential differences were 0. 7 +/- 0. 1 mV (24 filters, seven experiments) and 1. 3 +/- 0. 1 mV (13 filters, two experiments) apical side negative, and the corresponding resistances were 217 +/- 11 ohm X cm 2 and 233 +/- 12 ohm X cm 2. Terbutaline (10 microM) produced a biphasic response with a transient decrease and then a sustained increase in potential difference. Amiloride (0. 1 mM) completely abolished the potential difference when it was added to the apical side but not when it was added to the basal side, whereas 1 mM ouabain inhibited the potential difference more effectively from the basal side. Thus, type II cells form a polarized epithelium in culture, and these cells actively transport electrolytes in vitro...|$|R

40|$|Adherence to {{the culture}} {{substratum}} exerted a significant influence on the growth and survival of murine bone marrow cells incubated under conditions that favored the development of mononuclear phagocytes. Bone marrow cells cultured two weeks in unprocessed polystyrene dishes, refractory to cell attachment, reached a maximum or near maximum cell density by day 11. This density was stable throughout {{the duration of the}} incubation period. Characterization of the cells on day 11 revealed an essentially pure population of mononuclear phagocytes composed of round, nonadherent cells, and slightly elongated, loosely attached cells. Bone marrow cells incubated in polysty-rene tissue <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> processed to promote cell attachment also reached a maxi-mum cell density by day 11. However, this maximum density was only half that attained by cells incubated in unprocessed polystyrene dishes. Furthermore, continued incuba-tion resulted in a sharp decline in cell viability and number. The cells in tissue <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> on day 11 represented a pure mononuclear phagocyte population composed principally of cells adherent {{to the surface of the}} dish. The subsequent analysis of cells subcultured in processed and unprocessed polystyrene dishes indicated that adherence to the substratum modulated the growth factor requirements of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes.

40|$|Unique {{functional}} materials {{provide a}} platform as scaffolds for cell/tissue regeneration. Investigation of cell-materials’ {{chemical and biological}} interactions will enable the application of more functional materials {{in the area of}} bioengineering, which provides a pathway to the novel treatment for patients who suffer from tissue/organ damage and face the limitation of donation sources. Many studies have been made into tissue/organ regeneration. Development of new substrate materials as platforms for cell/tissue regeneration is a key research area. Studies discussed in this paper focus on the investigation of novel ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) films as substrate/scaffold materials for developmental biology. Specially designed quartz dishes have been coated with different types of UNCD films and cells were subsequently seeded on those films. Results showed the cells’ growth on UNCD-coated <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> are similar to cell <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> with little retardation, indicating that UNCD films have no or little inhibition on cell proliferation and are potentially appealing as substrate/scaffold materials. The mechanisms of cell adhesion on UNCD surfaces are proposed based on the experimental results. The comparisons of cell cultures on diamond-powder-seeded <b>culture</b> <b>dishes</b> and on UNCD-coated dishes with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization—time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses provided valuable data to support the mechanisms proposed to explain the adhesion and proliferation of cells {{on the surface of the}} UNCD platform...|$|R
