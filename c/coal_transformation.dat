Throughout the twentieth century the fuel is the development engine of Douro’s coal basin. The dependence on coal determines the relevance of the supply system in the transformation of landscape, a technological one, stretching from the structures to support the exploration to the infrastructure systems of city.

The article considers anthracite powders and bituminous coal of Krasnogorsky mine with the use of non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis with mass spectrometry.

Other parameters – carbon content, ash and volatiles, density and moisture have been defined by standard methods. Energy of activation and pre-exponent with the use of models of Freedman, Starink and distributed activation energy model (DAEM), and also relative deviation of design data from experimental ones have been designed. The results of the analysis have shown the important influence of volatiles content and <b>coal</b> <b>transformation</b> degree on maximum reaction rate.

40|$|International audienceIn former <b>coal</b> <b>transformation</b> plants (coking and gas ones), {{the major}} organic {{contamination}} of soils is coal tar, mainly composed of {{polycyclic aromatic compounds}} (PACs). Air oxidation of a fresh coal tar was chosen to simulate the abiotic natural attenuation impact on PAC-contaminated soils. Water-leaching experiments were subsequently performed on fresh and oxidized coal tars to study the influence of oxidation on dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality and quantity. The characterization of the DOM was performed {{using a combination of}} molecular and spectroscopic techniques (high-performance liquid chromatography-size-exclusion chromatography (HPLC-SEC), 3 D fluorescence, and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS)) and compared with the DOM from contaminated soils sampled on the field exposed to natural attenuation for several decades. An increase in the oxygenated polycyclic aromatic compound concentrations was observed with abiotic oxidation both in the coal tar and the associated DOM. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in the leachates exceeded pure water solubility limits, suggesting that co-solvation with other soluble organic compounds occurred. Furthermore, emission excitation matrix analysis combined with synchronous fluorescence spectra interpretation and size-exclusion chromatography suggests that oxidation induced condensation reactions which were responsible for the formation of higher-molecular weight compounds and potentially mobilized by water. Thus, the current composition of the DOM in aged soils may at least partly result from (1) a depletion in lower-molecular weight compounds of the initial contamination stock and (2) an oxidative condensation leading to the formation of a higher-molecular weight fraction. Abiotic oxidation and water leaching may therefore be a significant combination contributing to the evolution of coal tar-contaminated soils under natural attenuation...|$|E
40|$|Coal {{is found}} in huge amounts {{throughout}} the world {{and is expected to}} play a crucial role as an abundant energy source. However, one critical issue in promoting coal utilization is controlling environmental pollution. Clean coal technologies are needed to utilize coal in an environmentally acceptable way and to improve coal utilization efficiency. This paper describes coal's role in China's energy system and the environmental issues related to coal use. Coal is responsible for 90 % of the SO 2 emissions, 70 % of the dust emissions, 67 % of the NOx emissions, and 70 % of the CO 2 emissions. But as the most abundant energy resource, it will continue to be the dominant energy supply for a long time. Therefore, the development and deployment of clean coal technologies are crucial to promote sustainable development in China. Clean coal technologies currently being developed in China are described including high efficiency combustion and advanced power generation technologies, <b>coal</b> <b>transformation</b> technologies, IGCC (integrated gasification combined cycle) and carbon capture and storage (CCS). Although China only recently began developing clean coal technologies, there have been many successes. Most recent orders of coal-fired power plants are units larger than 600 Â MW and new orders for supercritical and ultra supercritical systems are increasing rapidly. Many national research programs, industrial research programs and international collaboration projects have been launched to develop on IGCC and CCS systems in China.

40|$|AbstractChemical looping {{combustion}} {{has received}} great attention for its advantage to obtain pure CO 2 at a manageable cost.

TGA-FTIR experiments {{indicated that the}} reaction of LPS with CuO and Fe 2 O 3 mixed OC was more advantageous than that of LPS with CuO or Fe 2 O 3 separately. And especially at the later reaction stage, high concentration of CO 2 and H 2 O obtained from the reaction of LPS with CuO promoted LPS gasification and its further reaction with Fe 2 O 3, and the maximum weight loss rate for the reaction of LPS with Fe 2 O 3 was 0. 326 wt%/min, far close to that of LPS with CuO at the initial reaction stage. Furthermore, thermodynamic simulation of the reaction of LPS with CuO and Fe 2 O 3 mixed OC revealed that, in terms of LPS <b>coal</b> <b>transformation,</b> CO 2 and H 2 O were the dominant products. Meanwhile, during the reaction of LPS with CuO and Fe 2 O 3 mixed OC, CuO was mainly reduced to Cu, but besides Fe 3 O 4, deep reduction of Fe 2 O 3 into FeO occurred. Finally, CuO was preferred to react with FeS 2 inherent in LPS to form Cu 2 S but the reduced Fe 2 O 3 was easily reacted with SiO 2 in LPS to form FeSiO 3...|$|E

During the first two projects years, significant progress was made on most of the tasks, as described in detail in the two previous annual reports. In the current third annual report, we report in detail on the BYU task on the properties and intrinsic reactivities of chars prepared at high-pressure. A flat-flame burner was used in a high pressure laminar flow facility to conduct high temperature, high heating rate coal pyrolysis experiments. Heating rates were approximately 10 {sup 5 } K/s, which is higher than in conventional drop tube experiments. Char samples from a Pitt No. 8 coal and lignite were collected at 1300 C at 1, 6, 10, and 15 atm. Swelling ratios of the lignite were less than 1. 0, and only about 1. 3 for the Pitt No. 8 coal. All coals showed slight increases in swelling behavior as pressure increased. The swelling behavior observed for the Pitt No. 8 coal at each pressure was lower than reported in high pressure drop tube experiments, indicating the effect of heating rate on particle swelling. This heating rate effect was similar to that observed previously at atmospheric pressure. SEM photos revealed that bituminous coal has large physical structure transformations, with popped bubbles due to the high heating rate. TGA char oxidation reactivities were measured at the same total pressure as the char preparation pressure. The general trend was that the TGA reactivity on a gram per gram available basis decreased for both Pitt No. 8 and Knife River lignite coal chars with increasing char formation pressure. The Pitt No. 8 char intrinsic activation energy and oxygen reaction order remained relatively constant with increasing pressure. This new data provides some of the only information available on the morphology, structure, and reactivity of chars prepared in high pressure flames...|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{growth of}} the steel {{industry}} in coming years will be strongly dependent upon coal. Understanding of coal behavior in current or emerging ironmaking processes will require improved understanding of <b>coal</b> <b>transformation</b> during direct injection or after carbonization. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of coke minerals on coke reactivity such that the reactivity was shown to increase with increasing contents of magnetite, pyrrhotite, and metallic iron. Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} understand how coal minerals transform during carbonization particularly at higher temperatures and how mineral transformation is influenced by carbonization and heat treatment conditions and, in turn, how the transformed minerals affect reactivity. However, there is limited information available about transformation of coal minerals as a function of coal properties, carbonization and heat treatment conditions. In this study, the effect of coal mineral transformation was investigated, particularly iron-bearing minerals on coke reactivity. Effect of high heating rate on coal mineral transformations was studied in a TGA reactor. Carbonization tests were conducted in a 100 g and a 9 kg coke oven. Coal devolatilization and coke annealing were examined under controlled conditions in a horizontal tube furnace. The mineralogy of coal and coke was analyzed using XRD, QEMSCAN and FESEM/EDS. Implications of minerals transformation on coke reactivity with CO 2 was studied in a fixed bed reactor at 1173 K. The study demonstrated that total volatile yield of lump coals was not influenced by either the tested range of temperature or particle size. The devolatilization rates of coal decreased with increasing size of coal, however for coal lumps above 10 mm there appeared to be little effect of particle size. The swelling tendency of lump coals increased with increasing volatile content, particle size and heating rate. Swelling ratio based on measurements of physical dimensions of individual large coal particle or lump coal did not have any relation to the free swelling index commonly reported by the existing coking tests. The study showed that low swelling coals may be more vulnerable to cracking. The study showed that both the apparent reaction rates of cokes and chars made from the same coals were modified greatly under different carbonization conditions and the differences were much greater than those seen with different coal types. The micropore surface areas and the carbon structure of cokes were also significantly influenced by heating rate, soaking time and temperatures during carbonization and thermal treatment, however the initial apparent reaction rates of cokes and chars was not strongly related to either carbon crystallite height, micropore surface area of cokes and chars or rank and maceral composition of the parent coals as seen in the past for cokes. The study also demonstrated the strong influence of carbonization conditions on the transformation of coal minerals. In particular the magnitude and type of potential catalytic iron minerals mainly iron sulfide, metallic iron and iron oxide were affected by the carbonization conditions. At higher temperatures they transformed to non-catalytic iron minerals mainly silicide. The initial reactivities of cokes and chars with CO 2 increased with increasing amounts of the catalytic iron minerals present and this relationship was found to be independent of carbonization conditions as well as heat treatment temperature at total catalyst levels below 1. 0 wt%. However, at greater catalyst levels CO 2 reaction rate was less sensitive to the total amount of catalytic iron phases. The initial apparent reaction rate of cokes annealed at higher temperature (1773 K) significantly decreased due to decreased levels of catalytic iron minerals as well as increased ordering of the carbon structure. The catalytic impact of minerals on reactivity was also found to decline with progressive gasification. This study suggests that transformation of coal iron minerals to potential catalytic iron-bearing minerals in coke can be optimized by suitable selection of carbonization conditions and hence to control coke quality particularly gasification reactivity. The study demonstrates that understanding of high temperature performance of coal matter, particularly coal mineral matter is important to optimize coke quality for both current and emerging blast furnace operations. The quantitative mineralogical analysis suggests that transformation of iron-bearing minerals in coal to catalytic iron phases in coke may be optimized by controlling the heating rate and temperature during carbonization. Further understanding of the influence of coal mineral grain size and morphology on the distribution as well as the catalytic intensity of iron and calcium species in coke is required on establishing a quantitative relationship with coke quality parameters particularly reactivity...|$|E

Experiments of devolatilization were performed in inert gas (N 2) at atmospheric pressure and in batch-type hot-wire screen reactor. The mass-loss values of both coals at selected final reaction temperatures (300 - 900 °C) and retention times (3 - 28 s) were obtained.

40|$|Abstract. Two chinese {{bituminous}} coals used in {{coal-fired power}} plants are combusted under air conditions in a lab-scale drop tube furnace. The effects of minerals transformation on the formation of PM 2. 5 are investigated during the combustion of coal blends. The collected PM were subjected to Computer controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM) and High-resolution transmission electron microscopy(HRTEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis for determination of chemical species within them. The results show that PM 2. 5 emissions are not linearly related to the wt. % of the parent coal or <b>coal</b> blends. <b>Transformations</b> of fine Si-Al mineral grains provided by the minerals in coal XQ into coarse particles (> 2. 5 µm in diameter) {{are responsible for the}} reduction of PM 1 - 2. 5 during the combustion of coal blending. The transformed fine Si-Al particles are captured by the coarse Ca-Mg-Al-Si provided by the minerals in coal HT to form larger Ca-Mg-Al-Si particles (> 2. 5 µm in diameter). Increasing Ca and Mg concentration in coal blends enhances the liquid concentration produced during combustion and hence affects the emissions of PM 1 and PM 1 - 2. 5.

40|$|The present work {{analyses}} {{the changes}} in the chemical structure of a perhydrous coal during its thermal evolution at different temperatures in an open-medium pyrolysis system. The results obtained were compared with those described for non-perhydrous coals in order to establish the effect of the substances assimilated by the coal structure (hydrocarbon/oil-like substances) on the thermal evolution of the <b>coal.</b> The <b>transformation</b> ratio at each stage of thermal treatment was determined and the chemical-structural characterisation of the resultant products was performed. Changes in textural and microtextural properties associated with structural modifications during the evolution were also tested. The results obtained show that this perhydrous coal develops a specific evolution pathway different from that followed by non-perhydrous coals with a normal H/C ratio. The substances assimilated by the perhydrous coal cannot be easily and totally released from its structure {{so that they can be}} only partially removed after thermal treatment. Thus, the treatment debilitates the interactions between the substances and the coal matrix in addition to weakening and cracking the matrix during the thermal process. The increase in temperature also leads to the conversion of some of the heavy assimilated substances into lighter compounds. However, the assimilated substances are present even at high temperatures of the thermal process, providing hydrogen which has the effect of stabilising the radicals originated during the pyrolysis and improving the fluidity properties in the reacting medium.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is {{to carry out the}} {{necessary}} experiments and analyses to extend leading submodels of <b>coal</b> <b>transformations</b> to the new conditions anticipated in next-generation energy technologies. During the first project quarter, a technical kick-off meeting was held on the Brown campus involving PIs from Brown (Hurt, Calo), BYU (Fletcher), and B&W (Sayre, Burge). Following this first meeting the current version of CBK (Version 8) was transferred to B&W McDermott and the HP-CBK code developed by BYU was transferred to Brown to help guide the code development in this project. Also during the first project year, progress was reviewed at an all-hands meeting was held at Brigham Young University in August, 2001. The meeting was attended by PIs Fletcher, Hurt, Calo, and Sayre, and also by affiliated investigators Steven Burge from McDermott and Prof. William Hecker from BYU. During the first project year, significant progress was made on several fronts, as described in detail in the previous annual report. In the current second annual report, we report on progress made on two important project tasks. At Brown University: (1) Char combustion reactivities at 500 C in air were determined for a diverse set of solid fuels and organic model compound chars. These varied over 4 orders of magnitude for the chars prepared at 700 C, and over 3 orders of magnitude for the chars prepared at 1000 C. The resultant reactivities correlate poorly with organic elemental composition and with char surface area. (2) Specially-acquired model materials with minute amounts of inorganic matter exhibit low reactivities that fall in a narrow band as a function of wt-% carbon. Reactivities in this sample subset correlate reasonably well with total char surface area. (3) A hybrid chemical/statistical model was developed which explains most of the observed reactivity variation based on four variables: the amounts of nano-dispersed K, nanodispersed (Ca+Mg), elemental carbon (wt-% daf), and nano-dispersed vanadium, listed in decreasing order of importance. Catalytic effects play a very significant role in the oxidation of most practical solid fuel chars. Some degree of reactivity estimation is possible using only elemental analyses of parent fuels, but only if correlative techniques make use of the existing body of knowledge on the origin, form and dispersion of inorganic matter in various fuel classes. During the past year at BYU, work focused primarily on renovation of the BYU high pressure drop tube reactor (HPDT). This work has included design and testing of a flat-flame burner that can be operated at high pressure. A high-temperature, high-pressure gas profile has been achieved within this high-pressure flat-flame burner (HP-FFB). Detailed descriptions of the design and testing of the HP-FFB are given in this report. In addition, continued char reactivity experiments in the high pressure thermogravimetric analyzer (HP-TGA) have been performed on chars produced at different pressures in the HPDT. Results of the HP-TGA reactivity studies on a high-volatile A bituminous (Pittsburgh No. 8) char are that intrinsic char activation energy increases with pyrolysis pressure, and that the oxygen order is roughly 0. 9. These results are different than previous research on chars produced at atmospheric pressure. These new data show that the rate constant decreases with increasing pyrolysis pressure. However, the hydrogen content of the new chars produced at elevated pressures was fairly high ({approx} 2 wt. %, daf), and char samples produced at higher temperatures are desired. During the next project year, experimental work on oxygen reactivity at high pressure will continue at BYU, and on CO{sub 2 } reactivity at high pressure at Brown University. Selected chars produced at BYU under high pressure conditions will also be used at Brown for reactivity studies...|$|R
40|$|Thermoplastic {{behaviour}} of coal plays {{a critical}} role on developing high coke quality attributes including strength which are critical for efficient blast furnace operation. Effect of coal plasticity {{on the evolution of}} coke microstructure is complex and particularly limited in relation to role of coal mineral chemistry. This study reports an experimental investigation relating to <b>coal</b> phase <b>transformations</b> during controlled carbonization as a function of coal ash and mineral composition using a range of analytical tools including FTIR, GC/MS, XRD, SEM and Optical microscopy. The chemical nature and magnitude of various carbonization products were related to the microstructure and the mechanical strength their cokes. The study identified the significance of coal mineral chemistry on plasticity as well as coke microstructure and mechanical strength. A number of microstructure parameters were combined to develop a combination microstructural parameter, and related to coke tensile strength as well as plastic range of parent coals. Under the tested conditions, up to 5 wt. % of kaolinite addition in coal is found to improve the fluidity, which could be associated with the increase of CHAr/CHAl ratio as well as decrease in CH 3 /CH 2 ratio of the residual char. The proportion of C=O/C=C bonds affected the plastic range. The study further showed that elevated kaolinite level in coal suppresses the evolution of low molecular compounds in tar phase and decrease the fluidity. Kaolinite addition in coal showed a significant effect on altering tar composition particularly phenol and benzene content especially at lower temperatures. Increasing presence of kaolinite levels in coal increased coke tensile strength but did not show a similar level of improvement in case of conventional coke tumbling strength. The effect of kaolinite presence on coal pyrolysis behaviour was also influenced by particle size such that finer particle size promoted fluidity while coarse particles improve the release of hydroaromatic methylene compounds. Coarser kaolinite leads to improve coke microstructure as well as mechanical strength. The study has implications for coal blending practice for improving coke quality such that future studies may focus in clarifying the role of other coal minerals and their associations on their thermoplastic behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. During Sasol-Lurgi Fixed Bed Dry Bottom coal gasification, {{the mineral}} matter in <b>coal</b> {{undergoes}} various <b>transformations.</b> Heat induced transformation due to low ash fusion temperatures leads to agglomeration of the ash particles to sizes varying from tiny particles to lumps larger than 100 mm. Channel burning and {{instability in the}} ash bed can occur as a result. It is therefore important to understand and anticipate the reactions of the mineral matter prior to feeding the coal into a gasifier. The principal aims of this thesis were to investigate the effect of minerals and mineral associations on the ash fusion temperature of coal. Ash fusion temperature {{was used as a}} measure of the expected behaviour of the ash bed during gasification. Representative samples of run-of-mine coal from three sources were density separated and then comprehensively characterised. The predominant basic oxides present were identified to be Ca, Mg and Fe due to the presence of calcite, dolomite and pyrite. The results showed highest linear correlations with SiO 2 and CaO and confirmed literature that low ash fusion temperatures may be attributed to increased basic oxide levels and low SiO 2 /AI 2 O 3 ratios. The combined removal of Ca, Mg and Fe by chemical fractionation resulted in an increase in ash fusion temperature. Different combinations of minerals were removed by different leaching agents. Chemical fractionation selectively altered the mineral content of coal which in turn provided valuable information on mineral interactions. This was clearly illustrated in the models developed for the calculation of ash fusion temperature. Master...|$|R
