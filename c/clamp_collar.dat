50|$|Although clamp-type collars {{work very}} well under {{relatively}} constant loads, shock loads can cause the collar to shift its position on the shaft. This {{is due to the}} very high forces that can be created by a relatively small mass during impact, compared to a statically or gradually applied load. As an option for applications with this type of loading, an undercut can be made on the shaft and a <b>clamp</b> <b>collar</b> can be used to create a positive stop that is more resistant to shock loads.|$|E

50|$|The rocket {{was raised}} via the Meillerwagen lift frame and hydraulics. When vertical, the rocket was {{suspended}} above the firing stand, which {{was raised to}} touch the rocket fins. <b>Clamping</b> <b>collars</b> were used to connect the rocket to the firing stand, and the Meillerwagen was withdrawn less than a meter and the rocket was turned a quarter turn for the fuel connections to face the Meillerwagen platforms, which were lowered into position for standing. A separate three-section extendable ladder, the Magirus ladder, was used for areas of an erected rocket not accessible via the Meillerwagen.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{innovative}} and useful of the collars is the two-piece <b>clamping</b> <b>collar.</b> Two-piece clamp-style shaft collars can be disassembled or installed in position without having to remove other components from the shaft. The two-piece design provides greater clamping force than a single piece clamp {{because all of the}} force is transferred directly into clamping the shaft. In single piece designs, the non-tightened side provides negative force as it must hold the collar open to allow it to be placed onto the shaft. The single tightener must work against this force as well as provide clamping force of its own.|$|R
50|$|The {{base plate}} is very heavy and is fitted with four {{carrying}} handles. The sight bracket fits the standard mortar sight. The barrel is heavily reinforced at the muzzle {{and has two}} raised ribs midway of the barrel, between which the barrel <b>clamping</b> <b>collar</b> is held. The firing mechanism {{is similar to that}} used on the Type 99, 81 mm short mortar. After the weapon has been loaded, a plunger, which projects upward from the mortar breech, is struck with a mallet or similar instrument, thus camming out the firing pin and firing the mortar. A safety lock is fitted on this firing plunger.|$|R
50|$|Oppenheimer poles are {{galvanized}} iron telegraph poles. They consist of three oval sections that collapse {{into each other}} telescope style for transportation. Once extended the joints between the sections are <b>clamped</b> with <b>collars.</b> The pole is fixed to a base for support with a u-bolt.|$|R
5000|$|The Astra type LNBF that {{includes}} a feedhorn and polarizer {{is the most common}} variety, and this is fitted to a dish using a bracket that <b>clamps</b> a <b>collar</b> around the waveguide neck of the LNB between the feedhorn and the electronics package. The diameter of the LNB neck and collar is usually 40mm although other sizes are also produced. In the UK, the [...] "minidish" [...] sold for use with Sky Digital and Freesat uses an LNBF with an integrated clip-in mount.|$|R

40|$|A pair of spaced collars {{are mounted}} {{at right angles}} on a clamp body by {{retaining}} rings which enable the collars to rotate {{with respect to the}} clamp body. Mounting posts extend through aligned holes in the <b>collars</b> and <b>clamp</b> body. Each <b>collar</b> can be <b>clamped</b> onto the inserted post while the clamp body remains free to rotate about the post and <b>collar.</b> The <b>clamp</b> body is selectively clamped onto each post...|$|R
50|$|The twill was {{available}} as heavy, medium, and light grades, {{with the heavy}} having the best resistance to abrasion and puncture against rough surfaces like barnacles and rocks. Different types of dress are defined by the <b>clamping</b> of the <b>collar</b> seal to {{the rim of the}} corselet or to the joint between bonnet and corselet. The legs may be laced to reduce inflated volume, which could prevent excess gas from getting trapped in the legs and dragging an inverted diver to the surface. In normal UK commercial diving activities, the legs often did not have the lace up option.|$|R
30|$|The lower {{number of}} adverse events between circumcised clients may provide a {{reassurance}} to the potential circumcision clients to seek for SMC services (Kigozi et al. 2008). Use of devices for SMC scale-up including elastic collar compression (PrePex) and <b>collar</b> <b>clamp</b> (ShangRing) have been piloted in Uganda. PrePex device has been assessed for safety in “An Active AE surveillance phase” on 1000 clients and more than 1600 clients in the passive phase as per the WHO guidelines.

40|$|This {{document}} {{discusses the}} design, analysis, manufacturing {{and testing of}} the One-Ride human powered vehicle which was entered into the 2015 ASME West Coast HPVC Competition. The goal of the vehicle is to entice people to switch from gas powered vehicles to the One-Ride for trips of up to 20 miles round trip. The One-Ride design features fully adjustable seating and steering positions and was designed to fit anyone between the heights of 52 ̆ 722 ̆ 2  and 62 ̆ 742 ̆ 2  comfortably. The seat is adjusted using metal sliders, manufactured in the SCU machine shop, which fit into brackets attached to the frame. The bike features telescopic steering which is adjusted by the loosening and tightening of <b>collar</b> <b>clamps.</b> To increase the strength and safety of the frame, the welding and heat treatment were contracted to industry professionals. The frame was welded by Chavez Welding and heat treated by Byington Steel Treating. Deformation in the seat frame during heat treatment prevented full adjustability of the seat, however was secured in its middle position for testing. The wheelbase of the bike is 73. 33 in and has an overall height of 50. 77 in.. Slop in the steering caused instability at low speeds, which prevented the bike from being ridden in the ASME HPVC Competition. Design solutions to both of these problems have been identified. At the completion of senior design, the manufacturing is still ongoing...|$|R
40|$|This first {{contribution}} {{of a planned}} series on the morphology of the Ingoldian fungi discusses three aspects useful for conidial identification, something needed principally in stream ecology and biodiversity surveys: (1) types of propagules found; (2) release organ remnants found on propagules; and (3) conidial tails (or caudal appendages). (1) Propagules can be unexpectedly varied, and difficulty may be encountered in distinguishing, for example, misshapen conidia from expected ranges in conidial form, or in recognizing the outcome of post-release morphogenesis (involving elongation, branching or fragmentation, the latter resulting in part-conidia of several kinds); autonomous hyphal branching systems resembling branched conidia may undergo disorganized in situ fragmentation; propagules may be compound, the components covering more than one generation of the same morph or even more than one morph; conidial aggregations may behave as single dispersal units; and in one case {{it may be difficult}} to distinguish between thalli and propagules. (2) Conidia secede by means of various specialized structures (release organs) which leave behind remnants of diagnostic value. Among ascomycetous anamorphs are scars (half-septa resulting from schizolysis of release septa), basal collars (portions of lateral walls resulting from rhexolysis or fracture of release or separation cells), and in one case mucilaginous masses (probably the result of the gelification of release cells). The location of scars can sometimes only be inferred by means of other diagnostic characters, and in some instances it cannot even be inferred. This may lead to problems in orientating conidial and consequently in their identification. In the case of release cells, the remnants on the conidium frequently disappear or become indistinct. Among basidiomycetous anamorphs are twin scars (the result of paired schizolysis of the two septa, i. e. the axial and bridge septa, in the release <b>clamp),</b> excentric <b>collars</b> (seemingly the result of a combination of schizo- and rhexolysis of clamp components) and basal collars (the outcome of lysed evacuate conidiogenous cells). (3) The presence of tails is often inconstant, but where recognizable three types occur which may significantly aid in conidial orientation and hence identification. In addition, three methodological aspects are emphasized: the effect of the position of the conidium on the appreciation of some diagnostic characters, the need to observe spent conidiogenous structures, and in some cases the necessity of directly observing morphogenesis in order to interpret the conidial form. © The British Mycological Society.

50|$|The hero {{returns to}} normal form after Ashtara, a reptilian {{merchant}} and slaver who is searching {{the ruins of}} Undrentide for treasure, uses a magical potion to restore him/her. He afterwards <b>clamps</b> a magical <b>collar</b> around the hero's neck with which he can force him/her to do his bidding by sending electrical charges through the collar. Upon destroying the city's guardian golems who were hindering Astara's slaves {{in their search for}} treasure, Astara frees the hero, allowing him/her to search the ruins for Heurodis, who at this moment {{is in the process of}} completing a ritual which will restore Undrentide to the skies. It is discovered that she is atop a certain Tower of the Winds located in the center of the city and has used a magical force field to prevent anyone from entering the tower. By using three magical artifacts, the Wise Wind, the Dark Wind, and the Death Wind, known collectively as the Three Winds, the force field can be broken. The hero collects these artifacts, opening the force field, and climbing the tower, to find that Heurodis has already succeeded in raising the flying city. Heurodis, who is now a lich, has set up a circle of crystals through which the power of the mythallar flows in order to keep the city in the air. In the ensuing battle, one of the crystals is destroyed just as the mythallar's energy is passing through it, causing the energy to escape and the city to plummet. Knowing that as a lich Heurodis might be able to survive the fall, the hero kills her with his/her own hands, and afterwards uses a magical mirror which was found within Undrentide to escape to a plane of shadows and avoid impending death.|$|R
