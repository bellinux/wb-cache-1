5|$|The entire setup of Troy McClure {{presenting}} the episode is {{a parody of}} the practice by live-action series to produce clip shows in general, by <b>celebrating</b> <b>a</b> completely arbitrary milestone and by making exaggerated use of the conventions of traditional highlights shows, such as a grand introduction and relentlessly showbizzy host.|$|E
50|$|Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand was {{the most}} recent monarch to <b>celebrate</b> <b>a</b> {{platinum}} jubilee; he died shortly after official celebrations in Thailand took place. The next currently reigning monarch who would <b>celebrate</b> <b>a</b> platinum jubilee is Queen Elizabeth II, should she still be reigning on 6 February 2022. Furthermore, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh will, should they both still be alive and married {{to each other on}} 20 November 2017, <b>celebrate</b> <b>a</b> platinum wedding anniversary.|$|R
50|$|According to the Fasti Trimphales, the consul Publius Postumius Tubertus <b>celebrated</b> <b>an</b> ovation for {{a victory}} over the Sabines on 3 April 503 BC, and on the {{following}} day his colleague Agrippa Menenius Lanatus <b>celebrated</b> <b>a</b> triumph, also for {{a victory over}} the Sabines.|$|R

5|$|A final wave of war {{cemetery}} memorials {{were completed}} in the 1930s under the Fascist governments of Germany and Italy. The main Italian war cemeteries were not finished until 1938, and their positioning in some cases carried special political meaning, emphasising Italy's right to claim important, but ethnically diverse, border regions. In Germany, the same decade saw the completion of totenburgen, fortresses of the dead, used as war cemeteries and memorials. These were in some senses {{an extension of the}} cemetery designs of the 1920s, <b>celebrating</b> <b>a</b> natural German landscape, but included extensive modernist, monumental features, intending to highlight German artistic skill.|$|E
5|$|Antoninus Pius soon {{reversed}} the containment policy {{of his predecessor}} Hadrian, and Urbicus was ordered to begin the reconquest of Lowland Scotland by moving north. Between 139 and 140 he rebuilt a fort at Corbridge and by 142 or 143, commemorative coins were issued <b>celebrating</b> <b>a</b> victory in Britain. It is therefore likely that Urbicus led the reoccupation of southern Scotland , probably using the 2nd Augustan Legion. He evidently campaigned against several British tribes (possibly including factions of the northern Brigantes), certainly against the lowland tribes of Scotland, the Votadini and Selgovae of the Scottish Borders region, and the Damnonii of Strathclyde. His total force may have been about 16,500 men.|$|E
5|$|City {{reached the}} FA Cup final {{for the first}} time in their history in 1949, losing 3–1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. The club, however, was <b>celebrating</b> <b>a</b> week later when a draw on the last day of the season ensured {{survival}} in Division Two. Leicester won the Division Two championship in 1954, with the help of Arthur Rowley, one of the club's most prolific strikers. Although they were relegated from Division One the next season, under Dave Halliday they returned in 1957, with Rowley scoring a club record 44 goals in one season. Leicester remained in Division One until 1969, their longest period ever in the top flight.|$|E

5|$|In 682, Jasaw Chan K'awiil I erected {{the first}} dated {{monument}} at Tikal in 120 years and claimed {{the title of}} kaloomte, so ending the hiatus. He initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on Calakmul when, in 695, he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered. After this, Calakmul never again erected a monument <b>celebrating</b> <b>a</b> military victory.|$|E
5|$|Scarlett is widowed when Charles dies from {{a bout of}} {{pneumonia}} and measles while serving in the Confederate Army. Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in Atlanta to cheer her up, although the O'Haras' outspoken housemaid Mammy tells Scarlett she knows she is going there only to wait for Ashley's return. Scarlett, who should not attend a party while in mourning, attends a charity bazaar in Atlanta with Melanie where she meets Rhett again, now a blockade runner for the Confederacy. <b>Celebrating</b> <b>a</b> Confederate victory and {{to raise money for}} the Confederate war effort, gentlemen are invited to bid for ladies to dance with them. Rhett makes an inordinately large bid for Scarlett and, to the disapproval of the guests, she agrees to dance with him.|$|E
5|$|Skyler (Anna Gunn) calls Walter {{to inquire}} about buying the car wash where Walter once worked, which they plan {{to use as a}} front {{business}} for Walter's drug money. When Walter fails to act on the purchase, Skyler starts doing her own detailed research about the business's expenses and revenues. She later approaches the car wash owner, Bogdan (Marius Stan), about the proposed purchase, but he angrily rejects her, making sexist remarks and condemning Walter for having insulted Bogdan when he quit the car wash. Meanwhile, Marie (Betsy Brandt) continues struggling to deal with her husband Hank's (Dean Norris) deepening depression as he copes with physical therapy from having been shot. The bed-ridden and bitter Hank constantly ignores or insults Marie and, even after <b>celebrating</b> <b>a</b> successful session with his physical therapist, he refuses to share any of that excitement with Marie. Meanwhile, after three straight days of partying, Jesse tries to keep hanging out with Badger and Skinny Pete, but they are exhausted and go home, along with all of the other guests in Jesse's house. Alone with his thoughts, a depressed Jesse breaks down and cries, sitting less than an inch away from his speakers at an extremely high volume.|$|E
