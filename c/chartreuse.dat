After a transfer to the East Anglian city of Cambridge, the race went south to the finish in London. The Tour transferred across the English Channel {{to the start of}} stage four Le Touquet-Paris-Plage, with the finish in Lille. Stage five began in Ypres, Belgium, and finished back in France. The following three stages crossed the north-east to the Vosges Mountains for stages nine and ten. The eleventh stage took place between Besançon and Oyonnax through the Jura Mountains. Stage twelve headed west to Saint-Étienne, with the next stage moving back east into the <b>Chartreuse</b> Mountains, with the finish at the Apline ski resort of Chamrousse. The fourteenth stage ended in the town of Risoul. The following stage took the race south to Nîmes. After a transfer to Carcassonne, the route moved into the Pyrenees for the next two stages.

25|$|Certosa is the Italian {{name for}} a house of the cloistered monastic order of Carthusians founded by St. Bruno in 1044 at Grande <b>Chartreuse.</b> Though the Carthusians in their early centuries were known for their {{seclusion}} and asceticism and the plainness of their architecture, the Certosa is renowned for the exuberance of its architecture, in both the Gothic and Renaissance styles, and for its collection of artworks which are particularly representative of the region.|$|E
25|$|Benedict {{refused to}} attend the council in person, but his delegates arrived very late (14 June), and their claims aroused the protests and {{laughter}} of the assembly. The people of Pisa threatened and insulted them. The Chancellor of Aragon was listened to with little favour, while the Archbishop of Tarragona made a rash declaration of war. Intimidated, the ambassadors, among them Boniface Ferrer, Prior of the Grande <b>Chartreuse,</b> secretly left the city and returned to their master.|$|E
25|$|Henry II of England, {{as part of}} his penance for {{the murder}} of Thomas Becket, in lieu of going on crusade as he had promised in his first remorse, had {{established}} a Carthusian charterhouse some time before, which was settled by monks brought from the Grande <b>Chartreuse.</b> There were difficulties in advancing the building works, however, and the first prior was retired and a second soon died. It was by the special request of the English king that St. Hugh, whose fame had reached him through one of the nobles of Maurienne, was made prior.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Hugh {{became a}} {{religious}} novice and was ordained a deacon {{at the age of}} nineteen. About 1159, he was sent to be prior of the nearby monastery at Saint-Maximin, presumably already a priest. From that community, he left the Benedictine Order and entered the Grande <b>Chartreuse,</b> then at the height of its reputation for the rigid austerity of its rules and the earnest piety of its members. There he rose to become procurator of his new Order, in which office he served until he was sent in 1179 to become prior of the Witham Charterhouse in Somerset, the first Carthusian house in England.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, two hermits from a {{group of}} monks that had settled at Collan went to Rome and asked Pope Gregory VII to give them Robert as their superior. The pope granted their request, and as of 1074 Robert served as their leader. Soon after, Robert moved the small {{community}} to Molesme in the valley of Langres in Burgundy. Initially, the establishment consisted of only huts made of branches surrounding a chapel in the forest, dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Molesme Abbey quickly became known for its piety and sanctity, and Robert's reputation as a saintly man grew. It is because of this reputation that in 1082 Bruno of Cologne came to Robert seeking advice. He lived with Robert's community for a time before going on to found the Grande <b>Chartreuse,</b> the first Carthusian monastery.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{its high}} cost saffron was often {{replaced}} by or diluted with safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) or turmeric (Curcuma longa) in cuisine. Both mimic saffron's colour well, but have distinctive flavours. Saffron {{is used in the}} confectionery and liquor industries; this is its most common use in Italy. <b>Chartreuse,</b> izarra, and strega are types of alcoholic beverages that rely on saffron to provide a flourish of colour and flavour. The savvy often crumble and pre-soak saffron threads for several minutes prior to adding them to their dishes. They may toss threads into water or sherry and leave them to soak for approximately ten minutes. This process extracts the threads' colour and flavour into the liquid phase; powdered saffron does not require this step. The soaking solution is then added to the hot cooking dish, allowing even colour and flavour distribution, which is critical in preparing baked goods or thick sauces.|$|E

500|$|The Tomb of Antipope John XXIII in Florence {{is a grand}} Early Renaissance wall tomb by Donatello and Michelozzo; {{although}} classical in style, {{it reflects}} the somewhat inharmonious stacking up of different elements typical of major Gothic tombs. [...] It has a life-size effigy, {{also known as a}} gisant, lying on the sarcophagus, which was common from the Romanesque period through to the Baroque and beyond. [...] Ruling dynasties were often buried together, usually in monasteries; the <b>Chartreuse</b> de Champmol was founded for that purpose by the Valois Dukes of Burgundy in 1383. [...] The Scaliger tombs in Verona are magnificent free-standing Gothic canopied tombs—they are outside the church in a special enclosure, and so are unrestricted in height. Important churches like Saint Peter's in Rome, Saint Paul's Cathedral, London, Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice (twenty-five Doges), and the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence contain large numbers of impressive monuments to the great and the good, created by the finest architects and sculptors available. [...] Local parish churches are also often full of monuments, which may include large and artistically significant ones for local landowners and notables. [...] Often a prominent family would add a special chapel for their use, including their tombs; in Catholic countries, bequests would pay for masses to be said in perpetuity for their souls. [...] By the High Renaissance, led by Michelangelo's tombs, the effigies are often sitting up, and later may stand. [...] Often they turn towards the altar, or are kneeling facing it in profile.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{a number}} of other commissions, many for {{decorative}} painting in the palaces, Malouel is recorded as receiving in 1398 the wood for five altarpiece panels for the <b>Chartreuse</b> of Champmol, Philip's new dynastic burial place near Dijon, as well as painting the Well of Moses there, sculpted by Claus Sluter, the base of which survives with some of its colouring. From 1401, Herman of Cologne, perhaps a specialist gilder, is recorded as Malouel's assistant, or perhaps foreman of {{a number of}} apprentices. Painting the [...] "Well", and gilding all the upper parts, was a large job, on which they were occupied between 1401 and 1404.

2500|$|... 1791 - A {{visitor to}} the <b>Chartreuse</b> de Champmol, a Carthusian monastery in Dijon, now in France, but in the 15th century {{the capital of the}} Duchy of Burgundy, {{recorded}} seeing in the Prior's room paintings, originally in the ducal chapel of the monastery: [...] "... paintings on wood of the type of the earliest Flemish painters, which come from the chapels of the Dukes; they are about four feet high. The first, about a foot wide, is an Annunciation..." [...] The monastery was very largely destroyed in the French Revolution, but had been the burial place of the Dukes of Burgundy, and contained many important works. [...] The painting mentioned is thought likely to be the Washington painting, although the measurements (in the French pied, or foot, of the period) do not match very exactly.|$|E
2500|$|Another fragile {{candidate}} mineral is sphalerite (zinc blende). Gem-quality {{material is}} usually a strong yellow to honey brown, orange, red, or green; its very high RI (2.37) and dispersion (0.156) make for an extremely lustrous and fiery gem, {{and it is also}} isotropic. But here again, its low hardness (2.5–4) and perfect dodecahedral cleavage preclude sphalerite's wide use in jewelry. Two calcium-rich members of the garnet group fare much better: these are grossularite (usually brownish orange, rarely colorless, yellow, green, or pink) and andradite. The latter is the rarest and most costly of the garnets, with three of its varieties—topazolite (yellow), melanite (black), and demantoid (green)—sometimes seen in jewelry. Demantoid (literally [...] "diamond-like") especially has been prized as a gemstone since its discovery in the Ural Mountains in 1868; it is a noted feature of antique Russian and Art Nouveau jewelry. Titanite or sphene is also seen in antique jewelry; it is typically some shade of <b>chartreuse</b> and has a luster, RI (1.885–2.050), and dispersion (0.051) high enough to be mistaken for diamond, yet it is anisotropic (a high birefringence of 0.105–0.135) and soft (hardness 5.5).|$|E
2500|$|In the Battle of Loano, Massena's thrust {{cracked the}} Austro-Sardinian center while Augereau {{assaulted}} troops under Wallis on the coast. Augereau's division was organized into brigades under Pierre Banel, Elzéar Auguste Cousin de Dommartin, Jean-Baptiste Dominique Rusca and Claude Perrin Victor. Rusca attacked a position called the Greater Castellaro defended by Rukavina but was driven off. Accordingly, Augereau posted Victor's brigade {{to observe the}} position while Rusca's troops pressed forward. Meanwhile, Dommartin's brigade {{was sent back to}} overcome some Austrians in the <b>Chartreuse</b> redoubt who later surrendered. By this time, Rukavina and his 1,000 defenders were totally cut off. Augereau repeatedly demanded the surrender of the Greater Castellaro, but was rebuffed. Rukavina, [...] "smiling down from the parapet", indicated the place where he intended to break through Victor's brigade and announced, [...] "There is where I mean to pass". Leading the charge of his soldiers in column, his attack punched through the French lines. Victor's troops rallied and punished the column with musket fire, but Rukavina and about half his men escaped. Even the French were impressed by this exploit. Wallis retreated on the morning of 24 November with Rukavina leading his rearguard.|$|E
2500|$|Catholic {{theologians and}} canonists are severe on the Council of Pisa. A {{partisan}} of Benedict, Boniface Ferrer, the abbot of the <b>Chartreuse</b> of Saragossa, called it [...] "a conventicle of demons". A Saxon monk Theodore Urie, {{a supporter of}} Gregory XII, doubted the motives for the gathering at Pisa. St. Antoninus, Thomas Cajetan, Juan de Torquemada, and Odericus Raynaldus all cast doubt on its authority. On the other hand, the Gallican school either approves of it or pleads extenuating circumstances. Noël Alexandre asserts that the council destroyed the schism {{as far as it}} could. Bossuet says: [...] "If the schism that devastated the Church of God was not exterminated at Pisa, at any rate it received there a mortal blow and the Council of Constance consummated it." [...] Protestants applaud the council unreservedly, seeing in it [...] "the first step to the deliverance of the world", and greet it as the dawn of the Reformation (Gregorovius). Robert Bellarmine said that the assembly was a general council which was neither approved nor disapproved. [...] It was the original source of all the ecclesiastico-historical events that took place from 1409 to 1414, and opened the way for the Council of Constance.|$|E
