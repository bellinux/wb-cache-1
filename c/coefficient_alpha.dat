The item selection was based on criteria of appropriateness for older adults and psychometric contribution. The {{factor structure of the}} NEO-PI-R-SF proved highly equivalent to the parent instrument, indicating concordant validity. <b>Coefficients</b> <b>alpha</b> were generally lower due to the reduction of items. When assessed in a new sample of older adults (N= 794), the factor structure of the NEO-PI-R-SF proved replicable, except for the facet scales A 1 : Trust and A 3 : Altruism. <b>Coefficients</b> <b>alpha</b> for the domain scales were satisfactory, while the <b>coefficients</b> <b>alpha</b> for the facet scales were marginal to satisfactory and below those found in two adult samples (N= 1305 and N= 682). It was concluded that the NEO-PI-R-SF may be a time-saving alternative for research when a fine-grained description of personality among older adults is required.

In this paper, Kaiser's result is generalized. First, the invariance property is shown to hold for any set of orthogonal components. Next, a similar invariance property is derived for the reliability of any set of components. Both generalizations are established by considering simultaneously optimal weights for components with maximum alpha and with maximum reliability, respectively. A short-cut formula is offered to evaluate the <b>coefficients</b> <b>alpha</b> for orthogonally rotated principal components from rotation weights and eigenvalues of the correlation matrix.

40|$|Purpose：To {{examine the}} {{reliability}} and validity of the readiness of parenthood scale for adolescent males and females. The readiness of parenthood scale consists of 2 sub-scales. One sub-scale is the affection towards babies and another sub-scale is the child rearing drive. Internal consistency was analyzed by using Cronbach’s <b>alpha</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Construct validity was tested through factor analysis. The subjects were 200 adolescent males and females. 	Results：Cronbach’s <b>coefficients</b> <b>alpha</b> of affection towards babies were 0. 948 to 0. 967 for both males and females. Cronbach’s <b>coefficients</b> <b>alpha</b> of child rearing drive were 0. 833 to 0. 847 for both males and females. Concurrent validity was supported by correlation coefficients (0. 638 to 0. 667 p< 0. 01) between the affection towards babies and the scale of affection toward babies. Concurrent validity was supported by the correlation coefficient (0. 646 to 0. 668 p< 0. 01) between the child rearing drive and the scale of child rearing motivation. The experiences with children were significantly related to the affection towards babies and the positively child rearing motivation scale. Sub- factors of the affection towards babies and the positively child rearing motivation scale possessed higher validity.

50|$|This test is {{intended}} {{for the assessment of}} sexual dysfunctions in psychiatric patients and people with health problems (men and women). It particularly evaluates modifications and alterations of sexual functions in relation to the intake of medicines or psychotropic substances.This self-report questionnaire can be both administered by a clinician or self-administered. It is made up of 5 items rated on a 6-point Likert scale.Each item explores a particular aspect of sexuality: 1. Sexual drive, 2. Arousal, 3a. Penile erection; 3b. Vaginal lubrication, 4. Ability to reach orgasm, 5. Satisfaction from orgasm. Only one item of the scale has a male and a female version (3a - 3b). This test provides good reliability indexes with a Cronbach's <b>coefficient</b> <b>alpha</b> of 0,90 and correlation (at intervals of 1 and 2 weeks) with r = 0,80.
