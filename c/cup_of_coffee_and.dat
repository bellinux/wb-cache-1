5|$|We {{did a lot}} of {{recording}} at his house. I'd come by in the morning and Stuart would answer the door in his stocking feet– as he'd been up all night. I'd bring him a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> say, 'Stuart, your house is a mess, there's no food in the cupboard.' Then I'd call someone from my house to bring food over for him. And then we'd work all day. We're very much the odd couple.|$|E
5|$|According {{to his own}} account, {{the idea}} for writing Dreamtime first came to Duerr {{when he was in}} New Mexico in the summer of 1963. He had spent the day visiting the Puye Cliff Dwellings and was {{returning}} to the Albuquerque Greyhound Bus Station, where he met a Tewa Native yerbatero (herbalist) buying a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> struck up a conversation. Duerr asked the yerbatero if he could help him find a Native family living in one of the pueblos north of Santa Fe with whom he could stay, to conduct anthropological research into the nightly dances {{that took place in the}} subterranean kivas. The Native told him that if he wanted to find out about the dances in the kivas, then he should go to the Pueblo of Our Lady of the Angels and study at the University of California. Duerr would later relate that this blow to his vanity first provided him with the idea of writing Dreamtime.|$|E
500|$|After Budington and the {{remainder}} of the crew were rescued and returned to the United States, the board of inquiry continued. Budington attacked Tyson's credibility, disputing Tyson's claim that he had obstructed Hall's efforts to sail the ship further north. He also disputed reports of his drinking, saying that he [...] " [...] it a practice to drink but very little". Bessels was questioned about Hall's cause of death. Bessels stated that [...] "My idea of the cause of the first attack is that he had been exposed to very low temperature during the time that he was on the sledge journey. He came back and entered a warm cabin without taking off his heavy fur clothing, and then took a warm <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> <b>And</b> anyone knows what the consequences of that might be." [...] Bessels testified that Hall was [...] "taken by hemiplegia", and his left arm and side were paralyzed, and that he had injected Hall with quinine to correct his elevated temperature before he died.|$|E

5000|$|... "Coffee shop talk" [...] is {{a phrase}} used to {{describe}} gossip because it is often a familiar sight at kopi tiams {{where a group of}} workers or senior citizens would linger over <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> exchange news and comments on various topics including national politics, office politics, TV dramas, sports and food.|$|R
60|$|Both of {{the youths}} had been camping so often that they knew exactly what to do. The fire was stirred up, and fresh wood put on, and they {{prepared}} a couple <b>of</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> broiled two squirrels. They had bread and crackers, and a little cheese, and thus made quite a good breakfast.|$|R
500|$|Director John Ford {{said that}} when he was a prop boy {{in the early days of}} silent pictures, Earp would visit pals on the sets he knew from his Tombstone days. [...] "I used to give him a chair and a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> he told me about the fight at the O.K. Corral. So in My Darling Clementine, we did it exactly the way it had been." [...] When Ford was working on his last silent feature Hangman's House in 1928, which {{included}} the first credited screen appearances by John Wayne, Earp used to visit the set. John Wayne later told Hugh O'Brian that he based his Western lawman walk, talk and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Mix. [...] "I knew him... I often thought of Wyatt Earp when I played a film character. There's a guy that actually did what I'm trying to do." [...] Wyatt Earp's character has been the central figure in 10 films and featured in many more. Among the best-known actors who have portrayed him are Randolph Scott, Guy Madison, Henry Fonda, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster, James Garner, Jimmy Stewart, Hugh O'Brian, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner.|$|E
500|$|Hank Williams, {{who heard}} both the Miller and Griffin versions, started {{performing}} the {{song on the}} Louisiana Hayride shortly after joining in August 1948. Horace Logan, the show's producer and programming director for KWKH, reported that the audience [...] "went crazy" [...] the first time Williams performed the song on the show. [...] In light of the live audience's strong positive reaction, Williams decided to record the song. His decision was questioned by his musicians and also his producer, Fred Rose, who felt that the song did not merit a recording. Williams, mindful of the reaction he received live, [...] persisted, and the recording {{took place during the}} final half-hour of a session recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 22, 1948. For this recording, Williams replaced the jazz musicians with a modern country music band, using a rhythm guitar, mandolin, string bass, drums and a steel guitar. [...] Williams' session band was composed of Clyde Baum (mandolin), Zeke Turner (electric guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), Louis Innis (rhythm guitar), Tommy Jackson (fiddle) and Willie Thawl (bass). With little time left, Byrd and Turner replicated the musical arrangement they previously used on an Ernest Tubb session for a cover of Jimmie Rodgers' [...] "Waiting for a Train". [...] In the episode of American Masters about Williams, Drifting Cowboy Don Helms recalls, [...] "When they recorded 'Lovesick Blues,' Fred told Hank, 'That song's out of meter! [...] Got too many bars in it. [...] And you hold that note too long.' [...] And Hank said, 'Well, when I find a note I like, I wanna hold on to it as long as I can,' you know, just tryin' to be funny. [...] And Fred said, 'Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. [...] That thing is so much out of meter, I'm gonna get me a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> when I get back maybe ya'll have that thing cut.' [...] And they did, but it was still out of meter. [...] So Fred lived with that the rest of his life." [...] Williams combined Griffin's lyrical arrangement with a two-beat honky-tonk track, borrowing the yodeling and beat drops from Miller's recording. [...] "Lovesick Blues" [...] was recorded in two takes.|$|E
2500|$|Another issue {{concerning}} {{coffee is}} {{its use of}} water. It takes about [...] of water to grow the coffee beans needed to produce one <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> coffee is often grown in countries {{where there is a}} water shortage, such as Ethiopia.|$|E
60|$|Instead of {{entering}} a low den where riot and revelry, with bad language and quarrelling, {{might be expected}} to prevail, George Foster found himself in a small white-washed apartment, where there sat several grave and sedate men, wrapped in the voluminous folds of Eastern drapery, sipping very small <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> enjoying very large pipes of tobacco.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "brown bottle" [...] Buckfast has a {{caffeine}} content {{about equal}} to brewed or percolated coffee, while the [...] "green bottle" [...] Buckfast has a caffeine content about equal to black tea.

60|$|During the twelve-hour effort friends {{brought to}} the orator three glasses <b>of</b> wine, four <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> one glass <b>of</b> beer--a most stingy re-enforcement of his wasting tissues, but the hostile Chair would permit no {{addition}} to it. But, no matter, the Chair could not beat that man. He was a garrison holding a fort, and {{was not to be}} starved out.|$|R
2500|$|At eleven o'clock, therefore, I would {{despatch}} Miss Botterill to a neighbouring {{branch of}} the Aerated Bread Company {{for a glass of}} hot milk and a substantial slice of a cake appropriately known as lunch cake. I would then, at twelve-thirty, repair in person to the same branch of this valuable company, where I would generally order from one of the quieter waitresses a double portion of sausages and mashed potatoes, accompanied by a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> followed by an apple dumpling or a segment of baked jam roll.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, The Philadelphia Inquirer spoke with Strom {{to get a}} {{perspective}} {{on the life of}} an NBA referee for an article. [...] The sports reporter met Strom in a hotel lobby and was later joined by Milwaukee Bucks assistant coach, John Killelea. The three of them discussed referees and life in the NBA. When the article was published, the reporter wrote that he and Strom were joined by an assistant coach, whom Strom had bought a drink, and the tendencies for Strom to go into pressboxes to drink a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> to talk with spectators that he knew in the stands. While the league had approved the article, Strom was fined $2,000 and suspended a portion of the playoffs.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, major renovations {{were made}} to the Mahane Yehuda Market, {{including}} infrastructure work, repaving roads and covering some open areas. [...] The market's Board of Directors worked to make at least some of these changes in response to a decrease in visitors after terrorist attacks in 1997 and 2002 killed 23 people. Changes driven by the Board included renovations to the streets and alleyways, but also included efforts to draw in cafes and boutiques that would entice more middle-class customers who might become frequent shoppers. According to Eli Mizrachi, chairman of the Mahane Yehuda Merchants Association, whereas shoppers used to come to buy produce, the [...] "new generation" [...] wants a place with entertainment, a place to sit and have a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> a place to shop for gifts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dream of}} owners Rick Morris, Joan Morris and Kristen Chambers, Vincent's Ear {{opened its doors}} in summer of 1992. The cafe catered to a late night, downtown-dwelling crowd, which was {{virtually}} non-existent in the area at that time. In addition to Jolt Cola, $1 [...] "bottomless" [...] <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> a reasonably-priced food and drink menu, the cafe and bar also featured live music.|$|R
6000|$|But it was Stewart Snyder {{whom she}} encouraged. He {{was so much}} manlier than the others; he was an even warm brown, like his new {{ready-made}} suit with its padded shoulders.

60|$|I {{longed to}} hear Sir James's observations, but his {{provoking}} opposite neighbour began to talk, and I got {{nothing more to}} myself, and I had {{to spend the next}} half-hour in showing our grounds to Mrs. Vernon, who admired as if she were electioneering, and hindered me from knowing what anybody was about, till the people had had their <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> their carriages had come.|$|R

60|$|Here, by appointment, {{two friends}} met to discuss matters of grave importance. One was Bob Lumsden, the other {{his friend and}} admirer Pat Stiver. Having asked for and {{obtained}} two large <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> two slices <b>of</b> buttered bread for some ridiculously small sum of money, they retired to the most distant corner of the room, and, turning their backs on the counter, began their discussion in low tones.|$|R

60|$|The next moment, {{rather to}} their surprise, the general reappeared and, {{remounting}} the steps, spoke {{a word or}} two to Boyle in his turn. Then he signaled to Said, who hurried up with two <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> the two men re-entered the club, each carrying his cup in his hand.

500|$|Among Bedouins {{and most}} other Arabs {{throughout}} the region <b>of</b> Palestine, bitter <b>coffee,</b> known as qahwah sadah (Lit. plain coffee), {{was a symbol of}} hospitality.
