40|$|<b>Crypt</b> fission is now {{established}} {{as an important}} mechanism of intestinal growth and regeneration. It has been proposed that increased <b>crypt</b> size is the stimulus for <b>crypt</b> fission, because <b>crypts</b> preparing for fission are generally larger. Consequently, we investigated the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and dimethylhydrazine, which are both known to stimulate <b>crypt</b> cell proliferation, on <b>crypt</b> fission in the rat intestine. We also examined whether the effects of EGF on both proliferation and <b>crypt</b> fission are modified by the pretreatment with dimethylhydrazine for 16 weeks, dimethylhydrazine was then discontinued for 8 weeks, followed by intravenous infusion of EGF for 1 week. There were four groups: vehicle alone, EGF alone, dimethylhydrazine alone, and dimethylhydrazine followed by EGF infusion. The rats were killed at 25 weeks and rates of intestinal <b>crypt</b> cell production, <b>crypt</b> size, and <b>crypt</b> fission were determined. Intravenously infused EGF significantly increased <b>crypt</b> cell production rate, but {{the magnitude of the}} effect decreased from the proximal to the distal colon. EGF caused an increase in <b>crypt</b> area, possibly reflecting an increase in <b>crypt</b> size. Importantly dimethylhydrazine had no significant effect on <b>crypt</b> cell production rate nor on <b>crypt</b> area in the distal colon, but it did cause an increase in <b>crypt</b> area in the mid-colon. The <b>crypt</b> fission index was significantly decreased by EGF and increased by dimethylhydrazine. There was no qualitative interaction between EGF and dimethylhydrazine. These results demonstrate the marked proliferative effect of intravenously infused EGF in the colon of orally fed rats, with significant site effects (P = 0. 0007); the effect was greatest in the proximal colon and disappeared in the distal colon. The observation that EGF reduced <b>crypt</b> fission indicates that increased cell proliferation, per se, is not a stimulus for <b>crypt</b> fission. This is further supported by the observation that dimethylhydrazine increases <b>crypt</b> fission in <b>crypts</b> of normal size in the distal colon without significantly increasing cell proliferation. These results suggest that increasing <b>crypt</b> cellularity by proliferation is not sufficient to induce <b>crypt</b> fission, and factors other than increased <b>crypt</b> size by proliferation can control <b>crypt</b> fission. It is also probable that cell proliferation and <b>crypt</b> fission are independently regulated. <b>Crypt</b> fission appears to play a considerable role in the intestinal response to carcinogens...|$|R

40|$|Dysplastic colon adenomas {{are thought}} to arise from growth of clones of APC -/- colonic {{epithelial}} cells. Isolated clusters of dysplastic <b>crypts</b> are often observed in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. These patients have genotype APC +/-, and the clusters of dysplastic <b>crypts</b> (called microadenoma or aberrant <b>crypt</b> foci) {{are thought to}} represent an early stage in the expansion of a mutant clone of APC -/- cells. It is thought that the growth of these clusters of mutant <b>crypts</b> results from <b>crypt</b> replication through a process similar to what occurs in the normal <b>crypt</b> cycle. We measured the relative replication rate of mutant <b>crypts</b> by analyzing the size of clusters of mutant <b>crypts</b> in APC +/- individuals and found that mutant APC -/- <b>crypts</b> replicate more rapidly than do normal APC +/- (i. e., nonneoplastic) <b>crypts.</b> In contrast, the replication rate of mutant <b>crypts</b> in Apc +/- mice is {{not significantly different from}} that of normal <b>crypts,</b> thus supporting previous findings that aberrant <b>crypt</b> foci do not contribute significantly to the colon adenoma population in adult Apc +/- mice.

We used an inflammation-induced human {{model of}} tumorigenesis {{to explore how}} populations of mutated cells expand and initi-ate the earliest stages of cancer. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon {{associated with an increased}} risk of colorectal cancer mediated through a process of genomic instability. In order to characterize the process of clonal expansion, arbitrary primed (AR) and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) PCR DNA fingerprint mutation profiles of single <b>crypts</b> were compared with the mutational profiles from clusters of <b>crypts</b> and whole biopsies within the same individual. To provide informa-tion at the earliest steps of neoplastic progression, we examined histologically negative <b>crypts,</b> as well as dys-plastic <b>crypts.</b> <b>Crypts</b> from UC dysplasia/cancer show alterations in 10 [...] 20 % of DNA fingerprint sites, regardless of (i) whether the <b>crypts</b> were dysplastic or non-dysplastic and (ii) whether the DNA came from one <b>crypt</b> or thou-sands of <b>crypts.</b> Of the mutational changes in single <b>crypts,</b> almost half are clonally expanded to adjacent <b>crypts</b> and/or to the thousands of <b>crypts</b> in a single biopsy. Using fluor-escent in-situ hybridization to examine p 53 alterations in individual <b>crypt</b> cells, we demonstrate that the mechanism of clonal expansion can occur through <b>crypt</b> fission. DNA alterations are initiated in colonic <b>crypts</b> and expand to adjacent <b>crypts</b> through <b>crypt</b> fission. Our data suggest that a continuous process of DNA mutations, clonal expan-sion through <b>crypt</b> fission and clonal succession initiates the development of inflammatory-associated colon cancer; this mutational process is moderated by <b>crypt</b> cell turn-over and cell death.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Postnatal {{growth of}} the small {{intestine}} occurs by <b>crypt</b> hyperplasia and by the less recognised mechanism of <b>crypt</b> fission. How the small intestine grows is largely extrapolated from animals and is poorly described in humans. AIM: To investigate <b>crypt</b> fission and <b>crypt</b> hyperplasia as mechanisms of intestinal growth in humans. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Proximal intestinal samples were taken from 3 neonates at surgical anastomosis, and duodenal biopsies were taken at endoscopy from 16 infants (mean age 0. 7, range 0. 3 - 1. 7 years), 14 children (mean age 7. 9, range 2. 4 - 16. 2 years), and 39 adults. Morphometric measures of villous area, <b>crypt</b> length (measure of <b>crypt</b> hyperplasia), and percentage of bifid <b>crypts</b> (measure of <b>crypt</b> fission) were assessed by a microdissection technique. RESULTS: Mean <b>crypt</b> fission rates in neonates, infants, children, and adults were 7. 8 %, 15 %, 4. 9 %, and 1. 7 %, respectively. In particular, <b>crypt</b> fission peaked at 18 % in 5 infants from 6 to 12 months of age. Mean <b>crypt</b> length was 123 microm in neonates, 287 microm in infants, 277 microm in children, and 209 microm in adults. Thus, <b>crypt</b> hyperplasia had a broad peak during infancy and childhood. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that <b>crypt</b> fission was present predominantly during infancy, and <b>crypt</b> hyperplasia occurred during both infancy and childhood.
