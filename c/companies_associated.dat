500|$|Harrison found {{frustration}} in this {{next phase of}} the Bangladesh project, as the various record <b>companies</b> <b>associated</b> with the concerts' performers attempted {{to profit from the}} forthcoming release. Chief among these was the Beatles' US distributor, Capitol Records, who delayed issuing the album in the hope of negotiating a royalty rate to cover what they perceived as high distribution costs for the boxed three-record set. Harrison was resolute that Capitol should absorb the costs, just as the Beatles' Apple record label had already paid for the album's lavish packaging and full-colour booklet. All those involved with the concerts and post-production on the live album had given their services for free, in keeping with Harrison's hope that, in Tillery's words: [...] "Every penny of income – from the gate receipts to the profits from an album and a film – would go toward alleviating the suffering." ...|$|E
