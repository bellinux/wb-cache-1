2500|$|However, the 1965 {{agreement}} {{was a source}} of contention for the Parliament, which wished to be closer to the other institutions, so it began moving some of its decision making bodies, committee and political group meetings to Brussels. In 1983 it went further by symbolically holding a plenary session in Brussels, {{in the basement of the}} Mont des Arts <b>Congress</b> <b>Centre.</b> However the meeting was a fiasco and the poor facilities partly discredited Brussels' aim of being the sole seat of the institutions. Things looked up for Brussels when Parliament gained its own plenary chamber in Brussels (on Rue Wiertzstraat) in 1985 for some of its part-sessions. This was done unofficially due to the sensitive nature of the Parliament's seat, with the building being constructed under the name of an [...] "international conference centre". When France unsuccessfully challenged Parliament's half-move to Brussels in the Court of Justice, Parliament's victory led it to build full facilities in Brussels.|$|E
