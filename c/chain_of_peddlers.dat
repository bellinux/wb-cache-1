30|$|The {{present study}} seems to {{validate}} {{all the elements}} classified under “physical attributes”. The subaltern peddlers are reasonably diversified in their manufacturing processes, {{and the lack of}} standardization seems to be a defining feature. There are heterogeneous methods of doing business. The overall operations are small scale. The operations are decentred and dispersed with multiple groups <b>of</b> <b>peddlers</b> working in different areas following different modus operandi. Despite being part of a bigger business, each peddler operates independently in his territory his own salesmanship skills (all are males). A vitality-oriented environment (an attractive and conducive economic environment) is crucial to the operation <b>of</b> these subaltern <b>peddlers.</b> The business helps in the upliftment of the whole community of subalterns, extending to the non-working family members back in their village.|$|R

50|$|In Plato's Protagoras, Socrates {{draws an}} analogy between <b>peddlers</b> <b>of</b> {{unhealthy}} food and <b>peddlers</b> <b>of</b> false and deceptive wisdom. Food peddlers advertise their wares as healthy without offering solid evidence {{to back up}} their claims, leading those who trust them to succumb to an unhealthy diet. <b>Peddlers</b> <b>of</b> knowledge try to persuade impressionable young minds that what they teach is salutary and true, again without offering solid arguments to back up their claims. They mislead young minds on paths not conducive to intellectual flourishing.|$|R

5000|$|Peddlers {{have been}} the subject of {{numerous}} paintings, sketches and watercolours in both Western art and in the Orient, where they depict familiar scenes of every day life. The Peddlar by Hieronymous Bosch is perhaps the most icononic image of a peddler. Painted in about 1500, the peddler in this painting wears a costume almost identical to thieves in other Bosch paintings.

During the 18th century we see testimonies {{of the presence of}} Metsovite merchants in Constantinople, Bucharest, and Vienna. By the end of the 18th century there is an established community of merchants in Metsovo, which, through a collaborative or overlapping trade network, spread its operations over a rather extensive geographic area.|$|R

5000|$|Very few peddlers left written records. Many were {{illiterate}} and diaries are rare. [...] Most peddlers handled cash transactions {{leaving behind}} {{few or no}} accounting records such as receipts, invoices or day- books. However, {{a very small number}} <b>of</b> <b>peddlers</b> kept diaries and these can be used to provide an insight into the daily life of a peddler. Ephraim Lisitzky(1885-1962), an immigrant from Russsia arrived in the US in 1900 and took up peddling for a brief period folloiwng his arrival. His autobiography, published in 1959 under the title, In the Grip of the Cross-Currents, describes his various encounters with householders and the difficulties he experienced making a sale as door after door was slammed in his face.|$|R

Another group of people that identifies as Sheikh Mohammadi is mostly a community <b>of</b> <b>peddlers</b> with residence in eastern Afghanistan and the vicinity of Peshawar city in Pakistan. Members of this community speak Adurgari and are widely distinguished by their peripatetic lifestyle.

50|$|For {{many years}} on the first Thursday of every month, Western Avenue south of the canal and to the city limits on 139th Street was host to an open-air market, the Blue Island Market, more {{commonly}} known as Market Day.

As the postcard image to the right shows, items offered included produce, farm equipment, and livestock, with a local band thrown in to provide entertainment.

Ottoman immigration had been defended by La Rioja Senator Joaquín V. González. The Senate session was on September 12, 1910, few days before Arslan's arrival to Buenos Aires, on October 29, 1910.

Short after his arrival he visited Senator González to thank him for his defense of the Syro-Ottoman community. Since they were both fluent in French they could communicate without a translator. They became close friends until González's demise in December, 1923.|$|R

40|$|Hugh MacDiarmid was, {{to put it}} mildly, {{no great}} fan of twentieth-century Scottish popular culture. His work is {{peppered}} with slighting and outright derogatory references to popular writers and entertainers and to the recreational tastes of his compatriots: from the 'puerile and platitudinous doggerel' promoted by the degraded Burns cult; through the popular writing of those like Annie S. Swan and 'most other accepted Scottish litterateurs' who 'know nothing of literature and life' and 'have no ideas or ideals'; to {{the works of the}} popular Scottish Players movement, George Blake, John Brandane, Neil Grant, J. J. Bell, and Hugh Roberton, which are 'entirely destitute of literary distinction or significance'. [1] Among all this spleen sits one pre-eminent target for MacDiarmid's ire: an entertainer who was probably, at the time, the world's most famous living Scotsman, and who in MacDiarmid's resentful description 'rules the roost' — Sir Harry Lauder. [2] MacDiarmid's criticisms of Lauder take the form both of generalised attacks on the malign influences of popular culture in Scotland and more direct ad hominem assaults on Lauder's character. The gist of this commentary, as instanced in To Circumjack Cencrastus, is that Lauder is prime among a number <b>of</b> <b>peddlers</b> <b>of</b> 'hokum, hokum, hokum' — a part of a cultural racket that panders unashamedly to a debased popular taste and thus makes the work of serious art impossible...|$|R
