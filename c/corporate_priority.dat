The first three technologies are mainly applied in production processes in manufacturing sectors. I describe two main findings. First, green chemical technologies applied in production processes have increased due to both the scale-up effect and increased research prioritization. This result implies that policies that encourage overall research activity promote the invention of green chemical technologies that can be utilized in production. Second, biodegradable packaging and biochemical fuel cells related to product design and renewable energy increased mainly as a result of increased research prioritization.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to develop a psychoeducational programme for team coaches to facilitate the mental health of managers. Preventing managerial degeneration has become a <b>corporate</b> <b>priority.</b> Without support and intervention, executives and managers can degenerate personally or derail careerwise at enormous cost to themselves, their companies and the economy. Personal degeneration may include selfneglect, ignoring families, marriages, friends, personal interests and their own physical and mental health as they chase their corporate and career objectives. Business managers are subjected to more pressure than ever to produce results, yet they are often promoted through job specific expertise without the emotional intelligence and worklife balance skills necessary to sustain them. Research has revealed an across the board consensus that coaching {{is one of the most}} powerful strategic and tactical weapons open to business today because of its ability to enhance areas of proficiency that are already high and to establish skills that were previously absent or weak. Business coaching provides the gateway to intellectual and emotional support and develops managers, thus avoiding managerial derailment and preparing individuals to meet the increasingly complex requirements of today’s business environment. Business and team coaching is distinct from other types of coaching and calls for additional competencies and expertise as specialisation areas. The coaching industry in Southern Africa is in its infancy and as such there are currently no barriers to entry. There is a lack of descriptive and accepted standards, agreed upon core competencies and accredited team coaching programmes that offer depth in terms of knowledge, skills, values and business acumen. In light of the above challenges the following research question arose: · What should a programme for team coaches consist of in order to facilitate the mental health of managers? A qualitative, explorative, descriptive and contextual research design was followed including autoethnography as a strategy. The research took place in four phases. Phase 1 : A situation analysis was done in order to explore and describe what a programme for team coaches should consist of in order to facilitate the mental health of managers. This involved the identification of key stakeholders. Focus groups and interviews were conducted and individual naïve sketches collected from individuals who were are not available for interviews. A literature control was conducted in order to verify findings. Phase 2 : Based on the abovementioned results, {{the research}} progressed to phase two, which involved the development of a programme. During this phase a conceptual framework was described that included an approach to the programme. Phase 3 : This phase presented a description of the programme as well as guidelines for the implementation of the programme. Phase 4 : The programme was evaluated and possible limitations were highlighted. Recommendations regarding possible further research were made. The researcher believes that business and team coaching will continue to thrive and gain increased status as a profession. With an empirically sound programme in place, business and team coaching is set to flourish and managers have a means to manage and maintain optimum mental health.

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Department of Human Services’ (DHS) implementation of initiatives to support the delivery of services to Indigenous Australians. Audit objective, criteria and scope The audit objective was to assess the effectiveness of DHS’ implementation of initiatives to support the delivery of services to Indigenous Australians. To form a conclusion against the objective, the ANAO adopted the following high level criteria: 	sound planning and administration arrangements were established to identify and address the access needs of Indigenous customers; 	service delivery arrangements were established to support the access needs of Indigenous customers; and 	performance monitoring and reporting arrangements provided visibility over service delivery to Indigenous customers and information to improve service delivery. Overall conclusion The Department of Human Services (DHS) provides services to {{a large proportion of the}} Indigenous population and expects that this customer group will continue to grow as a proportion of its overall customer base. Effective service delivery to disadvantaged groups remains challenging for government departments and a number of factors can affect access and uptake of services by Indigenous customers. In line with its goal of providing high quality services to all Australians, the department has made a number of organisational investments to better understand the needs of customers (including Indigenous customers) and the performance of the department in meeting customer needs through universally accessible services. The department has also acknowledged that accessibility to its universal services is central in its approach to Indigenous service delivery. Overall DHS has developed a reasonable approach to improving its focus on supporting the delivery of services to Indigenous Australians, although there is scope to apply key elements of the approach more consistently across the department. DHS’ key organisational responses to strengthening its approach to Indigenous servicing have included the development of the Indigenous Servicing Strategy in 2012; structural arrangements, including specialist staff focused on supporting Indigenous servicing at both the frontline and national office levels; consideration of Indigenous service delivery issues and priorities in departmental business planning; and development of systems and processes to monitor data relating to Indigenous access and use of DHS services. The department has also worked to promote improving Indigenous service delivery as a <b>corporate</b> <b>priority</b> to which all DHS areas need to contribute, and has promoted this priority through senior management of the department. The development of the Indigenous Servicing Strategy has provided the foundation of a planning and monitoring framework to support an improved standard of Indigenous servicing across the department. Reflecting the importance of improving access to mainstream services for Indigenous customers, a central aspect of DHS’ approach is the concept that Indigenous servicing is ‘everyone’s business’. However, while various areas of the department pay specific attention to the accessibility of the services they are able to influence or control, this is not uniformly the case across the organisation. In particular, the approach taken by different business areas and service zones to reflect Indigenous service issues was variable, with some areas demonstrating considered approaches while other areas adopted a more minimalist approach with little explicit consideration of Indigenous matters. There is scope to improve guidance for planning and to develop a stronger quality assurance process in relation to the development of plans by business areas and service zones. DHS collects and maintains data relating to customer usage across a range of service areas. The analysis of usage data can assist departments with respect to assessing the effectiveness of resource allocations and service delivery approaches, as well as informing aspects of policy development. Indigenous usage data, while available, is not regularly extracted for analysis and often does not allow a comparison to be made between non‑Indigenous usage and Indigenous usage of services. Such comparative analysis would contribute to the department’s understanding of whether equitable and accessible services are being provided for Indigenous customers. More specifically, improved data analysis would allow the department to provide front line and program design staff with a better understanding of the composition and needs of their customer base, including the unique needs of particular groups, and allow them to respond to service gaps and needs with targeted resources within operational budgets. Through the Indigenous Servicing Strategy, DHS has established a performance framework to provide internal management information on the department’s performance in providing services to Indigenous customers. The department’s first report on the ISS identified several areas where DHS had performed favourably against performance measures. These included reported increases in the numbers of Indigenous people registered for Medicare and increases in the use of self-service channels. The framework is a positive step in developing a departmental‑wide view of Indigenous usage of key services. A further positive aspect of the performance framework is that performance information is also collected on aspects of DHS’ internal capability. There is however scope to improve the measures used in the framework through the inclusion of baseline information on service usage by Indigenous customers and targets for its improvement. The ANAO has made one recommendation aimed at improving the use of existing data within DHS in order to inform service delivery, service design and to enhance the department’s ability to contribute to policy development...|$|E

40|$|As a form {{of expert}} labour and {{organizational}} resource, knowledge workers are important in organizational life as producers and consumers of knowledge. The role of knowledge workers {{and the ways in}} which they transfer their knowledge become important as they possess the symbolic and analytic skills to undertake work which is contingent upon the application of ambiguous knowledge in uncertain, networked business environments. Yet, in much of the existing literature knowledge workers and knowledge transfer seem to have been partially interpreted and through a perspective maintaining an emphasis on organizational performance. Current understanding of the role of knowledge workers sees knowledge workers as either willing or reluctant to share knowledge, i. e. as either contributing to organizational efficiency or its opposite, while knowledge sharing is unequivocally understood as beneficial for organizational performance. The aim of the study is to produce an interpretation of knowledge transfer and the role of knowledge workers that extends beyond simplified and limited categories. The perspective of the knowledge worker is centrally adopted and, using this approach, the identity of knowledge workers and their interpretation of knowledge sharing are explored. The study focuses on 58 knowledge workers in the subsidiaries of five high-tech multinational companies in Athens, Greece, where complex, ambiguous knowledge work and operational interdependencies are supported by elaborate architectures of Knowledge Management initiatives. The method of data collection is interviews and data have been analysed by using QSR N-VIVO and developing thematic conceptual matrices. The findings suggest that, across organizational contexts, knowledge workers construct and maintain identities of competence and upward mobility and exhibit a combination of behaviour. Here, knowledge is better seen as being traded, rather than shared. Knowledge exchanges are subject to a set of knowledge trading principles which reflect self-interested and instrumental conceptualizations of competence and lead to the discrimination and selection of knowledge categories, uses and groups of colleagues. It is indicated that different conceptualizations of the self and various behaviours co-exist and manifest interchangeably thus both supporting and undermining <b>corporate</b> <b>priorities</b> throughout the course of practice.
