40|$|The <b>CHEK</b> 2 protein plays a {{major role}} in the {{regulation}} of DNA damage response pathways. Mutations in the <b>CHEK</b> 2 gene, in particular 1100 delC, have been associated with increased cancer risks, but the precise function of <b>CHEK</b> 2 mutations in carcinogenesis is not known. Human cancer cell lines with <b>CHEK</b> 2 mutations are therefore of main interest. Here, we have sequenced 38 breast cancer cell lines for mutations in the <b>CHEK</b> 2 gene and identified two cell lines with deleterious <b>CHEK</b> 2 mutations. Cell line UACC 812 has a nonsense truncating mutation in the <b>CHEK</b> 2 kinase domain (L 303 X) and cell line SUM 102 PT has the well-known oncogenic <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC founder mutation.

40|$|<b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC is a moderate-risk cancer {{susceptibility}} allele that confers a high {{breast cancer}} risk in a polygenic setting. Gene expression profiling of <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC breast cancers may reveal clues {{to the nature of}} the polygenic <b>CHEK</b> 2 model and its genes involved. Here, we report global gene expression profiles of a cohort of 155 familial breast cancers, including 26 <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC mutant tumors. In line with previous work, all <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC mutant tumors clustered among the hormone receptor-positive breast cancers. In the hormone receptor-positive subset, a 40 -gene <b>CHEK</b> 2 signature was subsequently defined that significantly associated with <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC breast cancers.

40|$|Abstract Background Segmental duplications (SDs) are {{euchromatic}} {{portions of}} genomic DNA (≥ 1 kb) that occur {{at more than}} one site within the genome, and typically share {{a high level of}} sequence identity (> 90 %). Approximately 5 % of the human genome is composed of such duplicated sequences. Here we report the detailed investigation of <b>CHEK</b> 2 duplications. <b>CHEK</b> 2 is a multiorgan cancer susceptibility gene encoding a cell cycle checkpoint kinase acting in the DNA-damage response signalling pathway. The continuous presence of the <b>CHEK</b> 2 gene in all eukaryotes and its important role in maintaining genome stability prompted us to investigate the duplicative evolution and phylogeny of <b>CHEK</b> 2 and its paralogs during anthropoid evolution. Results To study <b>CHEK</b> 2 duplicon evolution in anthropoids we applied a combination of comparative FISH and in silico analyses. Our comparative FISH results with a <b>CHEK</b> 2 fosmid probe revealed the single-copy status of <b>CHEK</b> 2 in New World monkeys, Old World monkeys and gibbons. Whereas a single <b>CHEK</b> 2 duplication was detected in orangutan, a multi-site signal pattern indicated a burst of duplication in African great apes and human. Phylogenetic analysis of paralogous and ancestral <b>CHEK</b> 2 sequences in human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque confirmed this burst of duplication, which occurred after the radiation of orangutan and African great apes. In addition, we used inter-species quantitative PCR to determine <b>CHEK</b> 2 copy numbers. An amplification of <b>CHEK</b> 2 was detected in African great apes and the highest <b>CHEK</b> 2 copy number of all analysed species was observed in the human genome. Furthermore, we detected variation in <b>CHEK</b> 2 copy numbers within the analysed set of human samples. Conclusion Our detailed analysis revealed the highly dynamic nature of <b>CHEK</b> 2 duplication during anthropoid evolution. We determined a burst of <b>CHEK</b> 2 duplication after the radiation of orangutan and African great apes and identified the highest <b>CHEK</b> 2 copy number in human. In conclusion, our analysis of <b>CHEK</b> 2 duplicon evolution revealed that SDs contribute to inter-species variation. Furthermore, our qPCR analysis led us to presume <b>CHEK</b> 2 copy number variation in human, and molecular diagnostics of the cancer susceptibility gene <b>CHEK</b> 2 inside the duplicated region might be hampered by the individual-specific set of duplicons. </p...|$|R

Methods: In total, 126 breast tumor tissue specimens including 32 samples from patients carrying <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC were studied in array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and gene-expression (GEX) experiments. After dimensionality reduction with CGHregions R package, <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC-associated regions in the aCGH data were detected by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The linear model was fitted to GEX data with R package limma. Genes whose expression levels were associated with <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC mutation were detected by the bayesian method. Results: We discovered four lost and three gained <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC-related loci. These include losses of 1 p 13. 3 - 31. 3, 8 p 21. 1 - 2, 8 p 23. 1 - 2, and 17 p 12 - 13. 1 as well as gains of 12 q 13. 11 - 3, 16 p 13. 3, and 19 p 13. 3. Twenty-eight genes located on these regions showed differential expression between <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC and other tumors, nominating them as candidates for <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC-associated tumor-progression drivers. These included CLCA 1 on 1 p 22 as well as CALCOCO 1, SBEM, and LRP 1 on 12 q 13. Altogether, 188 genes were differentially expressed between <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC and other tumors. Of these, 144 had elevated and 44, reduced expression levels. Our results suggest the WNT pathway as a driver of tumorigenesis in breast tumors of <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC-mutation carriers and a role for the olfactory receptor protein family in cancer progression. Differences in {{the expression of the}} 188 <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC-associated genes divided breast tumor samples from three independent datasets into two groups that differed in their relapse-free survival time. Conclusions: We have shown that copy-number aberrations of certain genomic regions are associated with <b>CHEK</b> 2 mutation 1100 delC. On these regions, we identified potential drivers of <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC-associated tumorigenesis, whose role in cancer progression is worth investigating. Furthermore, poorer survival related to the <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC gene-expression signature highlights pathways that are likely to have a {{role in the development of}} metastatic disease in carriers of the <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC mutation...|$|R
40|$|Already {{published}} {{data were}} further analyzed regarding {{the association between}} the <b>CHEK</b> 2 * 1100 delC germ line mutation and estrogen receptor (ER) status in patients with breast cancer. The <b>CHEK</b> 2 * 1100 delC mutation was more prevalent among the patients with a positive ER status (4. 2 % versus 1. 0 %). An ER-negative status was beside <b>CHEK</b> 2 * 1100 delC mutation and independently associated with an earlier of age onset of breast cancer. There was a trend that an ER-negative status, beside {{the presence of a}} <b>CHEK</b> 2 * 1100 delC mutation, was associated with a worse disease-free survival. There might be an association between ER status and a <b>CHEK</b> 2 * 1100 delC mutation. More studies with larger number of patients are needed to further investigate the relation between <b>CHEK</b> 2 * 1100 delC and ER statu...|$|R
40|$|Germline {{mutations}} in <b>CHEK</b> 2 {{have been associated}} with a range of cancer types but little is known about disease risks conveyed by <b>CHEK</b> 2 mutations outside of the context of breast and prostate cancer. To investigate whether <b>CHEK</b> 2 mutations confer an increased risk of bladder cancer, we genotyped 416 unselected cases of bladder cancer and 3, 313 controls from Poland for 4 founder alleles in the <b>CHEK</b> 2 gene, each of which has been associated with an increased risk of cancer at other sites. A <b>CHEK</b> 2 mutation (all variants combined) was found in 10. 6 % of the cancer cases and in 5. 9 % of the controls (OR = 1. 9; 95 %CI 1. 3 – 2. 7; p = 0. 0003). We conclude that <b>CHEK</b> 2 {{mutations in}}crease the risk of bladder cancer in the population...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenic}} <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC variant {{is firmly}} {{established as a}} breast cancer susceptibility allele. Dutch <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC breast cancer families frequently also include colorectal cancer cases, and the variant is particularly prevalent among breast cancer families with hereditary breast and colorectal cancer. Yet, it is still unclear whether <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC also confers a colorectal cancer risk independent of its breast cancer risk. <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC was genotyped in the index cases of 369 Dutch colorectal cancer families that had been excluded for familial breast cancer. The cohort included 132 cases with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and FAP-related disease, and 237 cases with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and HNPCC-related disease. None of the FAP/FAP-related cases carried the <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC variant. In contrast, <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC was present in 10 of 237 (4. 2 %) HNPCC/HNPCC-related cases that was significantly more prevalent than the 1. 0 % Dutch population frequency (odds ratio, 4. 3; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 7 - 10. 7; P = 0. 002). Nine of the 10 <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC colorectal cancer cases met the revised Amsterdam and/or Bethesda criteria. The 10 <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC colorectal cancer families had a high-risk cancer inheritance pattern, including 35 colorectal cancer cases, 9 cases with polyps, and 21 cases with other tumor types. Our analysis provides strong evidence that the 1100 delC variant of <b>CHEK</b> 2 confers a colorectal cancer risk in HNPCC/HNPCC-related families, supporting the hypothesis that <b>CHEK</b> 2 is a multiorgan cancer susceptibility gen...|$|R
30|$|The <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC variant {{was found}} in women {{suffering}} from breast cancer with familial Li-Fraumeni syndrome (Bell et al. 1999). In 2004, <b>CHEK</b> 2 -Breast Cancer Consortium did a collaborative analysis with 10 studies from 5 western countries, which involved 10 860 breast cancer cases and 9 065 controls (<b>CHEK</b> 2 Breast Cancer Case–control Consortium <b>CHEK</b> 2 * 1100 delC and susceptibility to breast cancer 2004). The Consortium found the frequency of <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC to be 1.9 % and 0.7 % in cases and controls respectively, and confirmed that this gene variant could potentially {{increase the risk of}} breast cancer. The <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC variant has been reported to be a low-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility allele (Vahteristo et al. 2002; <b>CHEK</b> 2 Breast Cancer Case–control Consortium <b>CHEK</b> 2 * 1100 delC and susceptibility to breast cancer 2004; Oldenburg et al. 2003; Kuusisto Kirsi et al. 2011). It results in an approximately two-fold risk of breast cancer in women and a ten-fold risk in men (van der Groep et al. 2011). It has been detected in 5 % of breast cancer patients from non-BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 families (Vahteristo et al. 2002; Meijers-Heijboer et al. 2002). The frequency of <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC allele varies among different populations. Indeed, high mutation rates are seen in Northern and Eastern European countries (Vahteristo et al. 2002; <b>CHEK</b> 2 Breast Cancer Case–control Consortium <b>CHEK</b> 2 * 1100 delC and susceptibility to breast cancer 2004; Meijers-Heijboer et al. 2002) although its frequency is much lower in North America (Mateus Pereira et al. 2004; Offit et al. 2003), whereas the mutation {{does not seem to be}} a triggering factor to breast cancer in Poland (Kwiatkowska et al. 2006; Cybulski et al. 2004) and some multiple-case breast cancer families from Australia (Jekimovs et al. 2005). Likewise, the frequency of <b>CHEK</b> 2 1100 delC seems to be very low in Southern Europe, Italy (Caligo et al. 2004), Spain (Osorio et al. 2004; Bellosillo et al. 2005) and rare in Brazil (Zhang et al. 2008).|$|R
