40|$|Gus", a 5 {{year old}} male Boxer dog, {{presented}} {{for evaluation of}} muscle weakness and regurgitation. On physical examination, Gus was weak, depressed, and in thin body condition. A neurologic examination was consistent with diffuse neuromuscular disease. Initial bloodwork changes were consistent with dehydration, previous corticosteroid administration, and an inflammatory process. Thoracic radiographs revealed a diffuse megaesophagus and aspiration pneumonia, likely secondary to regurgitation. Appropriate differential diagnoses for megaesophagus and diffuse neuromuscular disease were considered. Results from a thyroid panel revealed primary hypothyroidism. An intravenous Tensilon test was positive. Results of acetylcholine receptor antibody titers revealed a strong positive (6. 06 nmol/L, normal < 0. 6 nmol/L), confirming a diagnosis of acquired myasthenia gravis (MG). Gus was administered antibiotics and underwent nebulization and <b>coupage</b> therapy to treat his aspiration pneumonia and was administered anticholinesterase therapy to treat his MG. He responded well to this therapy and was discharged {{after two weeks of}} hospitalization...|$|E
40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 2005. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf [13]). Lucy, an 8 -year-old female spayed Labrador retriever mix, {{presented to}} the Triage Service at Cornell University Hospital for Animals due to signs of respiratory distress. Lucy's owner indicated a history of inappetance, intermittent cough, and difficulty walking {{for the past two}} weeks. Initially, Lucy {{presented to the}} referring veterinarian (rDVM) who recorded a right hindlimb lameness, fever of 104. 3 degrees Fahrenheit, and tachypnea. Cephalexin was prescribed to treat a possible bronchitis seen on chest radiographs. The following day she re-presented to the rDVM. Serum chemistry revealed a mildly increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Tachypnea was still evident yet her lungs ausculted normally, so a week-long course of Deramaxx for possible blunt trauma to the chest was initiated. Ptyalism, progressive intermittent inappetance, and white mucoid sputum were observed for several days. She was rechecked by the rDVM one week later, at which time a complete blood count (CBC) documented a leukocytosis. Heartworm test was negative at this time. She was treated with more cephalexin, aminophylline as a bronchodilator, and instructions for nebulization and <b>coupage</b> at home. Within five days, Lucy stopped drinking abruptly, and would only eat via syringe force-feeding. Her owner mentioned that she did not tolerate pilled medications; Lucy had become increasingly stubborn over the last several days and would clench her mouth shut when her owner attempted to medicate her. After approximately two weeks since her original symptoms, Lucy presented to Cornell...|$|E
40|$|A 7 {{year old}} spayed female Labrador Retriever {{presented}} to Cornell University Hospital for Animals’ (CUHA) Orthopedic Service for progressive hind limb lameness/paresis {{two weeks in}} duration. She was diagnosed with hip dysplasia as a younger dog. She was treated with deracoxib and dexamethasone, but only responded transiently to the latter. Upon presentation to CUHA she was paraplegic with absent pelvic limb proprioception. Pain {{was present at the}} level of T 10 -T 11. A complete blood count revealed thrombocytopenia and a stress leukogram. The chemistry panel showed an increase in liver enzymes. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Thoracic radiographs revealed no obvious lesions. Differential diagnoses included, in order of priority, fibrocartilaginous embolism (FCE), neoplasia, intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) and infectious disease (e. g. neospora, rabies). An abdominal ultrasound was conducted the following day and did not disclose any neoplasia. An MRI showed a large lesion in her spinal cord suggestive of an infarct, but no evidence of compression. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was suggestive of a primary central nervous system disease. These results ruled out IVDD and supported FCE or neoplasia as the top differentials. Nine days after admission, the patient’s lung sounds were increased and she had moderate difficulty breathing. Thoracic radiographs did not reveal overt signs of aspiration pneumonia, but this was the presumptive diagnosis. She was placed on oxygen, started on enrofloxacin and ampicillin with sulbactam and treated with nebulization and <b>coupage.</b> The following morning, she began to show vestibular signs. Later that morning, she had a seizure, which was treated with diazepam, but seizures recurred. The owners elected euthanasia later that day. Her body was submitted for necropsy, which ultimately revealed CD 3 + intravascular neoplastic cells, consistent with intravascular T cell lymphoma. Neoplastic cells were identified in sections of the brain, spinal cord, liver, stomach and lung. This is a rare neoplasia that is reported in the dog, and is also described in humans. This neoplasia is often neurotropic in nature; however, the mechanism of this tropism is currently unknown...|$|E
