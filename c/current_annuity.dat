25|$|Between 1956 and {{the advent}} of Personal Pension Schemes in July 1988, Equitable sold {{policies}} with an option to choose at the retirement date between a fixed Guaranteed Annuity Rate (GAR) or the <b>Current</b> <b>Annuity</b> Rate (i.e. the market annuity rate at that time) (CAR). The latter reflected the anticipated investment return on the lump sum over the annuity holder's lifetime and often changed depending on long-term interest yields and views on future longevity. No additional premium was charged in respect of the guarantee.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 July 2000 the House of Lords {{upheld the}} Appeal Court ruling. They {{concluded}} that GAR policies {{required that the}} guaranteed rate was applied to calculate the contractual annuity; and {{that the effect of}} the differential terminal bonus rates was that the annuity was calculated at <b>current</b> <b>annuity</b> rates, not at the guaranteed rate, and was not lawful. [...] "The self-evident commercial object of the inclusion of guaranteed rates in the policy is to protect the policyholder against a fall in market annuity rates ... The supposition of the parties must be presumed to have been that the directors would not exercise their discretion [...] in conflict with contractual rights." ...|$|E
5000|$|Equitable Life (est 1762) issued ‘with profits’ life {{assurance}} policies, {{which are a}} way of saving for retirement. If policy holders took benefits as a taxable annuity (i.e. with a payment annually), then they got tax exemptions on the premiums (and bonuses {{at the end of}} the year). They could choose to have their annuity at a [...] "guaranteed annual rate" [...] ("GAR") that would be fixed, or a [...] "current annuity rate" [...] ("CAR") that would fluctuate according to the market. The choice did not affect the premium. From 1993 the <b>current</b> <b>annuity</b> fell below the guaranteed one. Article 65 of the Equitable Life's Articles of Association said the directors could, at their discretion, vary bonuses and the company had relied on this since its foundation.|$|E
40|$|The change made to {{pension schemes}} in last week’s Budget calls into {{question}} the basic definition of what a pension is. True, the <b>current</b> <b>annuities</b> market is highly flawed, yet the new measure not only fails to address the existing problems sufficiently, it also brings about several perverse consequences. Craig Berry argues this is a measure that will fail spectacularly, even on its own terms...|$|R
40|$|Annuity {{premiums}} {{are often}} {{assumed to be}} constant, although they {{can be expected to}} vary with the yield curve. Variations in premiums will become an important public policy issue as defined-contribution (DC) pension plans play an increasingly prominent role in providing retirement income. As DC plan holders retire, many will annuitize at least a part of their account balances. In the absence of <b>current</b> data on <b>annuity</b> prices, the paper relies on U. S. Treasury interest rate data to simulate the impact of interest rate variation on annuity premiums. For a spectrum of feasible interest rates, the variation in retirement income is not negligible. ...|$|R

50|$|Many of Equitable's with-profits {{policies}} {{were designed to}} provide a pension for the policyholder on retirement, and the lump sum available to buy an annuity depended on the sum assured, the reversionary bonuses and the larger terminal bonus. Both types of bonus were allocated at the discretion of the directors in accordance with Article 65 of the Articles of Association, the total being intended to reflect the investment return earned over the lifetime of the policy, subject to smoothing.Between 1956 and the advent of Personal Pension Schemes in July 1988, Equitable sold policies with an option to choose at the retirement date between a fixed Guaranteed Annuity Rate (GAR) or the <b>Current</b> <b>Annuity</b> Rate (i.e. the market annuity rate at that time) (CAR). The latter reflected the anticipated investment return on the lump sum over the annuity holder's lifetime and often changed depending on long-term interest yields and views on future longevity. No additional premium was charged in respect of the guarantee.|$|E
5000|$|The {{directors}} of Equitable Life decided they {{would reduce the}} level of terminal bonuses for GAR policyholders, from the higher figure shown on the GAR policyholders' annual bonus notices, to a lower figure (if necessary to zero) so as to equalise the benefits so far as possible i.e. the policy proceeds with the higher terminal bonus times the CAR rate equalled the policy proceeds with lower terminal bonus times the GAR rate (the Differential Terminal Bonus Policy - DTBP). The Equitable's Annual Regulatory Returns, submitted each year to the regulatory authorities (the Department of Trade and Industry - DTI) had set out this practice since the 1993 (when the <b>current</b> <b>annuity</b> rate first fell below the guaranteed annuity rate). The Equitable's Annual Regulatory Returns had been scrutinized each year by the regulatory authorities and nothing adverse had been said by the regulatory authorities about the Equitable's Differential Terminal Bonus Policy (which had been introduced in 1993).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} <b>current</b> <b>annuity</b> market in Singapore and {{discusses}} {{the pros and}} cons of a proposal to mandate annuitization under the Singaporean Central Provident Fund (CPF). We evaluate the pricing of various annuity policies in order to assess whether plan participants might benefit from higher annuity returns per dollar premium and lower adverse selection costs under the new annuitization mandate. Our results indicate that private annuity providers currently offer good value-for-money annuities, with money’s worth values in line with those found for other developed countries. This has implications for proposals to mandate annuitization...|$|E
50|$|The advertised {{estimated}} jackpot {{represents the}} total payments {{that would be}} paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate {{is based on the}} funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity. The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-Power Play) revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the <b>annuity,</b> <b>current</b> market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Find the {{strategy}} which minimizes initial wealth required allowing a given lifetime ruin probability. Originality: The required consumption {{is assumed to}} be different for different ages and forms a U shape, reflecting the notion of different consumption requirement of different phases in retirement. Key literature / theoretical perspective: Milevky, Moore and Young (2005) 'Asset Allocation and Annuity-Purchase Strategies to Minimize the Probability of Financial Ruin'. Design/methodology/approach: I used a historical scenario approach to model stock return, instead of assuming a normal distribution. Findings: Given <b>current</b> <b>annuity</b> prices in Australia, there is very little incentive for retirees to annuitize; by incorporating life annuities into a financial strategy, a retiree is only able to reduce the wealth required at retirement by about 4 %. There is however huge potential for improvement, as when annuity prices provide fair value, the same retiree can reduce her required saving by about 30 %. Research limitations/implications: This paper also do not consider bequest motive and only assumes known future consumption, and {{does not take into account}} publicly provided age pensions. Practical and Social implications: There is a significant benefit of annuitization to retirees and government, however future research is required for an effective ways to make effective use of it. 2 page(s...|$|E
