40|$|In {{the context}} of serious or life-limiting illness, {{pediatric}} {{patients and their families}} are faced with difficult decisions surrounding appropriate resuscitation efforts {{in the event of a}} cardiopulmonary arrest. <b>Code</b> <b>status</b> orders are one way to inform end-of-life medical decision making. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the extent to which pediatric providers have knowledge of <b>code</b> <b>status</b> options and explore the association of provider role with (1) knowledge of <b>code</b> <b>status</b> options, (2) perception of timing of <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions, (3) perception of family receptivity to <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions, and (4) comfort carrying out <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions. Nurses, trainees (residents and fellows), and attending physicians from pediatric units where <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions typically occur completed a short survey questionnaire regarding their knowledge of <b>code</b> <b>status</b> options and perceptions surrounding <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions. Single center, quaternary care children's hospital. 203 nurses, 31 trainees, and 29 attending physicians in 4 high-acuity pediatric units responded to the survey (N = 263, 90 % response rate). Based on an objective knowledge measure, providers demonstrate poor understanding of available <b>code</b> <b>status</b> options, with only 22 % of providers able to enumerate more than two of four available <b>code</b> <b>status</b> options. In contrast, provider groups self-report high levels of familiarity with available <b>code</b> <b>status</b> options, with attending physicians reporting significantly higher levels than nurses and trainees (p = 0. 0125). Nurses and attending physicians show significantly different perception of <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussion timing, with majority of nurses (63. 4 %) perceiving discussions as occurring "too late" or "much too late" and majority of attending physicians (55. 6 %) perceiving the timing as "about right" (p< 0. 0001). Attending physicians report significantly higher comfort having <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions with families than do nurses or trainees (p≤ 0. 0001). Attending physicians and trainees perceive families as more receptive to <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions than nurses (p< 0. 0001 and p = 0. 0018, respectively). Providers have poor understanding of <b>code</b> <b>status</b> options and differ significantly in their comfort having <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions and their perceptions of these discussions. These findings may reflect inherent differences among providers, but may also reflect discordant visions of appropriate care and function as a potential source of moral distress.

40|$|It is {{imperative}} that Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) have the skill set necessary to initiate <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions with people. The literature supports that healthcare providers tend to avoid the topic, for reasons that include feeling uncomfortable, not having enough time, {{and not wanting to}} take away hope. How do we break down these barriers to ensure that healthcare providers feel comfortable and prepared to have <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions? The purpose of this project was to explore perceived barriers encountered by the Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) student population. A survey was developed that included sections on comfort level with <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussion, beliefs about DNR, barriers encountered in <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions, and two open ended questions. Findings revealed that participants overall were comfortable with having <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions, but were unfamiliar with the MOLST tool, a relatively new measure being used to facilitate <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions. Most participants believed that patients should always be informed about <b>code</b> <b>status</b> and should be asked if they would like to be a DNR. Numerous barriers were cited, the most common being unrealistic expectations and feeling uncomfortable addressing the issue of <b>code</b> <b>status.</b> More education, time and support, were cited as what would enable participants to have better conversations. Starting these discussions in the primary care office and then ensuring that this information is passed on could potentially improve outcomes.

We investigated the association between <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussion on admission and incidence of invasive procedures, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and opioid use among inpatients with advanced stages of cancer and noncancer diseases. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study in a single center, Ito Municipal Hospital, Japan. Participants were patients who were admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine between October 1, 2013 and August 30, 2015, with advanced-stage cancer and noncancer. We collected demographic data and inquired {{the presence or absence of}} <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussion within 24 hours of admission and whether invasive procedures, including central venous catheter placement, intubation with mechanical ventilation, and CPR for cardiac arrest, and opioid treatment were performed. We investigated the factors associated with CPR events by using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Among the total 232 patients, <b>code</b> <b>status</b> was discussed with 115 patients on admission, of which 114 (99. 1 %) patients had do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders. The <b>code</b> <b>status</b> was not discussed with the remaining 117 patients on admission, of which 69 (59 %) patients had subsequent <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussion with resultant DNR orders. <b>Code</b> <b>status</b> discussion on admission decreased the incidence of central venous catheter placement, intubation with mechanical ventilation, and CPR in both cancer and noncancer patients. It tended to increase the rate of opioid use. <b>Code</b> <b>status</b> discussion on admission was the only factor associated with the decreased use of CPR (P< 0. 001, odds ratio = 0. 03, 95 % CI = 0. 004 − 0. 21), which was found by using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

40|$|Presented at Society of Hospital Medicine, 05 / 18 / 2013, National Harbor, MDBackground Many {{problems}} exist regarding inpatient code status: {{advance directives}} are rarely completed in outpatient and inpatient settings; patients’ preferences regarding <b>code</b> <b>status</b> {{are often not}} elicited; physicians do not provide adequate information to allow patients {{to make informed decisions}} about code status; <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions are often delayed during an admission until it is too late for the patients to participate; and providers inappropriately extrapolate DNR orders to limit other treatments (such as artificial nutrition, ICU admission, etc.) Most hospitals default to “Full Code” as the status for patients admitted, particularly in patients with whom a <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussion cannot or has not taken place. In many cases, confirmation of “Full Code” does not occur later when these discussions become possible. These problems can result in patients receiving care they would not wish or choose. Purpose At the University of New Mexico (UNM), an academic safety net hospital, a multidisciplinary Advance Directives Task Force formed to address these issues. An initial survey found that < 2 % of inpatients had advance directives. The goals of the task force were to improve the above issues around <b>code</b> <b>status</b> and increase advance directive completion, in an effort to improve patient care at end of life. Description A multi-disciplinary team at the University of New Mexico met regularly for 2 years to address these concerns. Quality improvement measures included: 1) 	A revision of the hospital <b>Code</b> <b>Status</b> Policy including the following: a) 	All adult admissions will have a <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussion, identification of a surrogate decision maker, and a <b>code</b> <b>status</b> note written b) 	<b>Code</b> <b>status</b> orders are written for all adult inpatients and include the options of Presumed Full Code (for patients with whom a discussion cannot take place on admission), Confirmed Full Code (after discussion takes place with patient or surrogate), or DNR (eliminating “partial code” status orders) 2) 	Process Improvements included: a) 	Modification of existing orders and order sets in EMR b) 	Development of standardized templates for <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussion and surrogate decision maker identification notes c) 	Revision of patient handouts about Advance Directives in literacy appropriate language d) 	Education for physicians about “how to have a <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussion” e) 	Hospital-wide education to all staff about these changes Conclusions As a specialty, hospital medicine needs to take a more proactive role in ensuring that patients make informed decisions and receive all and only the care they desire. To make this cultural change in our nationwide practice, we submit these standards we hope to be adopted by other institutions including the use of ‘presumed’ and ‘confirmed’ code statuses, the expectation to have <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussions on all admissions with identification of surrogate decision maker, and to support increased education to hospitalist in engaging in these discussions...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To study whether {{health-care workers}} feel {{capable of making}} {{resuscitation}} decisions for their own families, the confidence in their family to represent their own preferences, and if some health-care workers feel greater {{confidence in their ability}} to undertake such decisions for their family than others. Methods: An anonymous survey conducted among health-care workers of nine institutions in North and Central America. The self-administered questionnaire included demographic and professional characteristics, attitudes, personal preferences, and value judgments on the topic of resuscitation. Results: Eight hundred and fifty-eight surveys were completed; 21. 1 % by physicians, 37. 2 % by nurses, and 41. 7 % by other health-care. Most of the health-care workers (83. 5 %) stated that they should be unable to determine their own <b>code</b> <b>status</b> and they would allow their family or spouse/significant other to make this decision for themselves. Physicians felt significantly more capable of making a decision regarding the <b>code</b> <b>status</b> of a close family member than other hospital workers (P = 0. 019). Professionals who chose to not undergo cardiopulmonary resuscitation were less likely to feel capable of determining the <b>code</b> <b>status</b> of their family. Conclusions: Most of the health-care workers feel capable of making <b>code</b> <b>status</b> decisions for a close family member and most feel equally comfortable having their family or spouse/significant other represent their <b>code</b> <b>status</b> preference should they be incapacitated. There is considerable reciprocity between the two situations.

40|$|Background: In Asian {{societies}} including Pakistan, {{a complex}} background of illiteracy, different familial dynamics, lack of patient’s autonomy, religious beliefs, and financial constraints give new dimensions to <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussion. Barriers faced by physicians during <b>code</b> <b>status</b> discussion in these societies are largely unknown. Aim: To determine the barriers and perceptions in discussion of <b>code</b> <b>status</b> by physicians. Design: Questionnaire-based cross-sectional study. Setting and participants: This {{study was conducted}} in the Department of Medicine of The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. A total of 134 physicians who had discussed at least five code statuses in their lifetime were included. Results: A total of 77 (57. 4 %) physicians responded. Family-related barriers were found to be the most common barriers. They include family denial (74. 0 %), level of education of family (66. 2 %), and conflict between individual family members (66. 2 %). Regarding personal barriers, lack of knowledge regarding prognosis (44. 1 %), personal discomfort in discussing death (29. 8 %), and fear of legal consequences (28. 5 %) were the top most barriers. In hospital-related barriers, time constraint (57. 1 %), lack of hospital administration support (48. 0 %), and suboptimal nursing care after do not resuscitate (48. 0 %) were the most frequent. There were significant differences among opinions of trainees when compared to those of attending physicians. Conclusion: Family-related barriers are the most frequent roadblocks in the end-of-life care discussions for physicians in Pakistan. Strengthening communication skills of physicians and family education are the potential strategies to improve end-of-life care.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the proportion of}} patients on a family practice ward who had "code status" orders and end-of-life discussions documented on their charts {{in the first week}} of admission. To examine the correlation between a tool predicting the likelihood of benefit from cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and actual end-of-life decisions made by family physicians and their patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study using a retrospective chart review. SETTING: A 14 -bed teaching ward where family physicians admit and manage their own patients in an urban tertiary care teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to the ward for 7 or more days between December 1, 1995, and August 31, 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of documented "do not resuscitate" (DNR) or "full code" orders and documented end-of-life discussions. Prognosis-after-resuscitation (PAR) score. RESULTS: In the 103 charts reviewed, <b>code</b> <b>status</b> orders were entered within 7 days for 60 patients (58 %); 31 were DNR, and 29 were full code. Discussion of <b>code</b> <b>status</b> was documented in 25 % of charts. The PAR score for 40 % of patients was higher than 5, indicating they were unlikely to survive to discharge from hospital should they require CPR. There was a significant association between PAR scores done retrospectively and actual <b>code</b> <b>status</b> decisions made by attending family physicians (P <. 005). CONCLUSIONS: End-of-life discussions and decisions were not fully documented in patients' charts, even though patients were being cared for in hospital by their family physicians.
