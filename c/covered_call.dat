25|$|One {{well-known}} {{strategy is}} the <b>covered</b> <b>call,</b> {{in which a}} trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and sells a call. If the stock price rises above the exercise price, the call will be exercised and the trader will get a fixed profit. If the stock price falls, the call will not be exercised, and any loss incurred to the trader will be partially offset by the premium received from selling the call. Overall, the payoffs match the payoffs from selling a put. This relationship is known as put-call parity and offers insights for financial theory. A benchmark index {{for the performance of}} a buy-write strategy is the CBOE S 500 BuyWrite Index (ticker symbol BXM).|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{benefit of}} an ETF is the stock-like features offered. A mutual fund is bought or {{sold at the}} end of a day's trading, whereas ETFs can be traded whenever the market is open. Since ETFs trade on the market, investors can carry out the same types of trades that they can with a stock. For instance, investors can sell short, use a limit order, use a stop-loss order, buy on margin, and invest as much or as little money as they wish (there is no minimum investment requirement). Also, many ETFs have the capability for options (puts and calls) to be written against them. <b>Covered</b> <b>call</b> strategies allow investors and traders to potentially increase their returns on their ETF purchases by collecting premiums (the proceeds of a call sale or write) on calls written against them. Mutual funds do not offer those features.|$|E

50|$|When trading a {{calendar}} spread, {{try to think}} of this strategy as a <b>covered</b> <b>call.</b> The only difference is that you do not own the underlying stock, but you do own the right to purchase it. By treating this trade like a <b>covered</b> <b>call,</b> it will help you pick expiration months quickly. When selecting the expiration date of the long option, it is wise to go at least two to three months out. This will depend largely on your forecast. However, when selecting the short strike, it is a good practice to always sell the shortest dated option available. These options lose value the fastest, and can be rolled out month-to-month {{over the life of the}} trade.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> {{position}} is a neutral-to-bullish investment strategy {{and consists of}} purchasing a stock and selling a call option against the stock. Two useful return calculations for covered calls are the %If Unchanged Return and the %If Assigned Return. The %If Unchanged Return calculation determines the potential return assuming a <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> position's stock price at option expiration {{is the same as}} at initial purchase. The %If Assigned Return calculation assumes the price of the stock is equal to or greater than the strike price of the sold call option. For in-the-money (see moneyness) covered calls, the calculations for %If Unchanged Return and the %If Assigned Return will be equal. Example calculations for %If Unchanged potential return and %If Assigned Return for covered calls are shown below: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{calendar}} call spread (see calendar spread) is a bullish {{strategy and}} consists of selling a put option with a shorter expiration against a purchased call option with an expiration further out in time. The calendar call spread is basically a leveraged version of the <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> (see above), but purchasing long call options instead of purchasing stock.|$|E
