Closed-loopcontrol seems an attractive option {{to meet the}} formulatedgoals. This study deals with the potential and limitationsof closed-loop SCR control. High NOx conversion in combination with acceptable NH 3 slip can be realized with an open-loop control strategy. However, closed-loop control is needed to make theSCR system robust for urea dosage inaccuracy, catalystageing and NOx engine-out variations. Then, the systemmeets <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and in-use compliancenorms. To demonstrate the potential of closed-loop SCR control,a NOx sensor based control strategy with cross-sensitivity compensation is compared with an adaptivesurface coverage/NH 3 slip control strategy and an open-loop strategy. The adaptive surface coverage/NH 3 slipcontrol strategy shows best performance over simulatedESC and ETC cycles. SCR catalyst dynamics, time delay in the urea injectionand maximum NH 3 slip targets limit the performance ofclosed-loop SCR control. If new reagent dosage systemsand future catalyst technology are able to relieve theselimitations, closed-loop control has the potential toreduce the calibration effort and to improve the transientcontrol performance...|$|R

The qualitative simulation of discrete-event machine systems is often based upon the use of qualitative simulation and discrete-event methods techniques too.

An object-oriented qualitative modelling and simulation toolbox, called QMTOOL, was extended and applied to real industrial machines and processes. The final analysis of the simulation results is accomplished using statistical and mathematical methods and applications for the evaluation of the final machine components as well as the <b>production</b> <b>procedures.</b> The important role of the qualitative modeling methodologies and the reliability of the statistical functions used are documented with practical case studies carried out in a machines constructions company.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Sound of {{motorcycles}} {{plays an}} important role in noise pollution in big cities. This is due to the lack of national law or standards to control the noise of domestic and also imported motorcycles. This study tries to introduce a practical limit value in different stage of motorcycle life cycle by assessing their noise pollution. Materials and Methods: First the motorcycles noise standards at different countries were studied and they were compared with the results from noise level of 622 motorcycles in 3 different groups. The sample volume in each group corresponds to the amount <b>of</b> their annual <b>production</b> rate. Then using statistical tests, a limit was determined in which 90 % of the domestic motorcycles can be covered. The limit is proposed as the standard for domestic motorcycle noise. Results: The limit for motorcycles of groups 1, 2 and 3 were 84, 86 and 87 dB (A),respectively in the TA stage. For the COP stage (<b>Conformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>Production),</b> the limit increases according to certain formula. In the end, a flowchart was proposed as a standard method for measuring the sound of motorcycles in the TA and COP stages was proposed. Conclusion: Noise level of the domestic motorcycles is at least 9 dB (A) higher than the noise limit value of European motorcycle. If European limit value is considered for producing the national motorcycle, 90 % of them will get out <b>of</b> <b>production</b> cycle and this would not be practical...|$|R

Intrastriatal transplantation of IAP+ cells sorted at day 16 of differentiation in a rat model of PD resulted in functional recovery.

Closed-loop control of SCR dosing enables the SCR system to be robust against disturbances and to meet <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> (COP) and in-use compliance norms.

Previous work, done in a simulation environment, demonstrated that an ammonia sensor provides the optimal feedback for urea dosing control algorithms in closed-loop SCR systems. A model-based SCR control strategy deploying an ammonia feedback sensor demonstrated high NOx conversion, low NH 3 slip and good robustness against disturbances. In this paper, FTP, ETC and ESC test data will be presented confirming these results. NOx conversions as high as 91 % are measured in combination with 30 % urea injection error and a 25 ppm NH 3 slip constraint.

Transesterification of triglycerides using supercritical ethanol on ion-exchange resin catalyst was investigated {{to study the}} ethyl ester conversion process. The reaction parameters investigated were the reaction time, pressure, temperature and molar ratio (alcohol to triglycerides), and their effect on the biodiesel formation. Addition of a co-solvent, supercritical carbon dioxide (critical point at 31 Â°C and 7. 3 MPa), decreased the operating conditions maintaining a high reaction rate.
