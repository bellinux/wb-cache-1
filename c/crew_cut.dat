Within a few days, he and his crew seized a sloop out of Rhode Island and plundered it.

5|$|Scully {{reports that}} the <b>Crew</b> <b>Cut</b> Man had no records on file with the FBI or other agencies. The {{material}} injected into the cows and children {{is found to be}} an unknown substance. All the children who were inoculated came down with a flu-like illness while those in the Church of the Red Museum did not, causing her to think they were a control group. Scully declares the case open and unsolved.|$|E
5|$|He adopted his <b>crew</b> <b>cut</b> hair style {{while serving}} in the United States Marine Corps. Carey has had {{refractive}} surgery to correct his vision and therefore did not really require glasses (any glasses he wore in public were merely props to help the audience recognize him). However, while this was true for several years, on the May 17, 2006, episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! he revealed that when he turned 40, he actually developed a need for bifocals. As of 2007, Carey resides in Los Angeles and New York City.|$|E

5|$|Emerald and Seahorse chased Anemone inshore, {{where she}} {{anchored}} {{in shallow water}} out of their reach. When they launched their boats to cut-out Anėmone, her <b>crew</b> <b>cut</b> the anchor cable and their ship drifted on to the shore; as the Frenchmen were attempting to escape along the coast, hostile Arabs captured them and stripped them of their clothes, shooting those who resisted. A heavy surf prevented the British boats from landing, so a midshipman from Emerald, the young Francis Fane, swam ashore with a line and empty cask to rescue the commander and seven others who had escaped naked to the beach. Anėmone had a crew of 60 men {{under the command of}} Enseigne de Vaisseau (Ensign) Garibou, and was also carrying General Camin and Citoyen Valette, Aide-de-Camp to General Napoleon Bonaparte, with dispatches from Toulon. Camin and Valette were among those the Arabs killed. Emerald remained stationed off Alexandria {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{transferred}} to the Ministry of War Transport, which renamed her Empire Simba and assigned Andrew Weir & Co. of London to manage her. After spending six weeks at Methil, where she had an advanced ship degaussing system installed among other repairs, Empire Simba proceeded to Oban via Lyness in mid November. She set out for North America in Convoy OB-253 on 2 December. Four days out, heavy weather dispersed the convoy, and Empire Simba proceeded independently. The ship continued to take a beating from heavy seas which opened the number one cargo hold to the ocean. Because the water was coming in faster than the bilge pumps in the hold number one could pump, the <b>crew</b> <b>cut</b> through the bulkheads into cargo hold number two to double the pumping capacity and were able to keep the ship under control long enough to arrive in Bermuda on 26 December. After temporary repairs were made there, Empire Simba sailed on 6 January 1942 first to Halifax and then to Baltimore for more permanent repairs.|$|E
25|$|Payne and Oliver and {{two others}} shot Comstock. In an {{atmosphere}} of distrust existing between the mutineers, Payne and Oliver made an error in judgment by sending Gilbert Smith, a boatsteerer, to secure the Globe. Smith and five other <b>crew</b> <b>cut</b> the anchor cable and set sail, eventually arriving at Valparaiso, Chile, where they were brought into custody by the American consul, Michael Hogan. Globe, under Captain King, was fitted out and returned to Nantucket, with Gilbert Smith as master, arriving in November 1824.|$|E

25|$|In late 1972, Radio Caroline {{had money}} problems. On 28 December, unpaid <b>crew</b> <b>cut</b> the Mi Amigos {{generator}} fuel line and departed. Later that day, the Dutch Royal Navy returned {{the crew and}} fighting broke out on board. Two days later, Mi Amigo was towed to IJmuiden and seized because of unpaid bills. Because of the Christmas holidays, no solicitors were available to issue a writ and the ship lay in Amsterdam harbour until O'Rahilly arranged {{for it to be}} towed back to sea. The ship was further delayed by hull damage and repaired before writs could be issued.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, the Conservation Commission, {{which the}} FFGC had become, {{found that there}} was still a large area of the {{southern}} Catskills, in Sullivan and Ulster counties, poorly served by the existing towers. Red Hill was chosen as the site for a new tower (supposedly after political pressure forced the state to reconsider Sullivan County's Denman Mountain to the south), and early in 1920 a forest ranger brought the disassembled tower up to the summit via horse-drawn wagon. A state <b>crew</b> <b>cut</b> a road through the Dibble farm up from nearby Red Hill Road, strung the telephone line along it, and put up the tower and cabin later that year.|$|E
500|$|Scully {{learns that}} Carpenter and her entire family {{have been killed}} in an {{automobile}} accident. Mulder returns to Berube's home and finds Secare in the attic.

Deep Throat meets Scully outside of Mulder's apartment and says that he may {{be able to make a}} deal with Mulder's captors. He gives Scully the credentials necessary to enter the High Containment Facility at Fort Marlene, where Scully finds an alien fetus contained within liquid nitrogen. At an exchange on a freeway overpass, Deep Throat presents the fetus to the <b>Crew</b> <b>Cut</b> Man, who shoots him seconds later. Mulder is thrown out of the <b>Crew</b> <b>Cut</b> Man's van as he drives off. Scully tends to Deep Throat, whose last words before dying are, [...] "Trust no one".|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Rick is {{murdered by}} the <b>Crew</b> <b>Cut</b> Man. Having passed by {{him on the}} road, Scully recognizes him as the assassin who killed Deep Throat. Her {{toxicology}} results on the victims show what she thinks is the mysterious substance known as [...] "Purity Control". Mulder theorizes that Larson had been injecting the children with alien DNA, and convinces Mazeroski to round {{up all of the}} children who had been receiving treatment from Larson and hide them in the Church of the Red Museum. Mulder tracks the <b>Crew</b> <b>Cut</b> Man down at a beef processing plant that he is about to destroy. While Mulder wants him alive, Mazeroski kills him as revenge for Rick's murder and Deep Throat’s murder as well.|$|E
500|$|After {{dropping}} out of high school, Moore found success as a radio host and {{then moved on to}} the television industry. He was host to several daytime and prime time programs entitled The Garry Moore Show, and the game shows I've Got a Secret and To Tell the Truth. He was instrumental in [...] furthering the career of comedic actress Carol Burnett. He became known for his bow ties and his <b>crew</b> <b>cut</b> fashion early in his career.|$|E
500|$|The {{meditation}} scene required {{clips from}} previous episodes {{to appear in}} flashback. Initially, Paul Rabwin and the special effects <b>crew</b> <b>cut</b> the necessary scenes and placed them in animated bubbles. According to Rabwin, at this point, the crew was just experimenting with ideas. Eventually, the crew decided that the bubbles were too [...] "hokey", so they adopted a more standard slit-scan effect. In order to create the sequence of Scully visualizing Waterston's heart condition, Nicolas Surovy had to lie naked on a platform surrounded by a blue screen. A sphere was matched via motion control as a marker for a prosthetic beating heart that was crafted and filmed separately. The two shots were then combined.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} season finale of The X-Files, [...] "The Erlenmeyer Flask", Mulder was taken hostage {{by a group of}} Men in Black operatives, {{following}} his investigation into an [...] alien-human hybrid program. Fearing for Mulder's life, Deep Throat helped Scully gain access to a high containment facility, where she managed to secretly remove a cryogenically-preserved alien fetus for use as collateral in saving Mulder. In the subsequent meeting between the operatives and Deep Throat, he was gunned down by an assassin, the <b>Crew</b> <b>Cut</b> Man. Deep Throat was buried at the Arlington National Cemetery. The character later appeared in dreams and visions experienced by Mulder during his recuperation on a Navajo reservation, and again years later while being experimented on by The Smoking Man.|$|E
500|$|While {{investigating}} the crime scene, Mulder finds an Erlenmeyer flask labeled [...] "Purity Control". Scully takes the flask to Georgetown University, where Dr. Anne Carpenter (Anne De Salvo) helps her analyze its contents. Meanwhile, Mulder heads to Berube's home and finds keys for a storage facility. Secare calls Berube's home office and Mulder answers, {{pretending to be}} Berube. Secare tells whom he believes to be Berube that he's been in the water for three days, and is hurt. Meanwhile, the <b>Crew</b> <b>Cut</b> Man eavesdrops on the conversation. Secare collapses due to blood loss before he can tell Mulder where he is. While he is driven away in an ambulance, a poisonous gas is emitted from Secare's body when the paramedics perform a needle decompression. Secare recovers and flees from the ambulance.|$|E
500|$|Producer Glen Morgan was {{disappointed}} with the resolution regarding the <b>Crew</b> <b>Cut</b> Man, saying [...] "My feeling is that to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen. I thought 'Geez, {{this is the guy}} who killed Deep Throat, who the audience loved, and it's kind of tossed away.' The episode just seems like half of one thing for a while, then half of something else. I think that was a curious choice for Chris [...] He wanted to take a real left turn, but I'd rather have seen a whole episode about that guy showing up and Mulder getting back at him." [...] X-Files writer James Wong also had a negative view of the episode, saying [...] "I think {{that was one of the}} most confusing episodes I've ever seen. It had some really neat ideas in it, but I don't think it pulled together finally." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{girlfriend of}} Mazeroski's son, Rick, Katie, {{is the latest}} to be found, and her blood is found to contain an unknown {{alkaloid}} substance {{and high levels of}} scopolamine, a controlled substance. This appears to link her to Odin, a former doctor. Meanwhile, the agents meet an old man who points to a pair of men injecting growth serum into cattle, which he believes is the cause of the trouble. That night, local doctor Jerrold Larson is killed in a plane crash. An investigation of the site turns up shipping orders that trace back to the kidnapped teens. One of the men injecting the cows is murdered by the <b>Crew</b> <b>Cut</b> Man. The other, a peeping tom named Gerd Thomas, is revealed to be the kidnapper after the agents find a hidden supply of videotapes in the home of one of the victims. Thomas claims that Larson had been turning the children into [...] "monsters" [...] with the drugs he had been injecting in them, which he claims to be unknown.|$|E
500|$|In another instance, a scene {{called for}} Garland {{to exit the}} saloon, jump on a horse, and ride out of town. When the scene was shot, Garland jumped over the horse instead of on it, so the scene had to be shot again. During the second take, she twisted her ankle running down the stairs in the saloon, but {{continued}} the scene. When Garland returned home, {{she thought it would}} feel good to put her ankle in a warm bath and did. She left it there for about an hour, but when she took it out, she found that it had swollen to twice its normal size. When she returned to the set, Corman said, [...] "Well, we have to start shooting." [...] In order to fit her ankle into her boot, the <b>crew</b> <b>cut</b> the back of it and taped it to her foot.

500|$|In March 2013, it was {{announced}} that Rogen and Goldberg would direct a comedy film for Columbia Pictures in which Rogen would star alongside James Franco, with Franco playing a talk-show host and Rogen playing his producer.

Lizzy Caplan joined the film's cast in October 2013. Caplan signed on to play Agent Lacey, a CIA agent who tries to get Franco's character to assassinate the Korean prime minister. Randall Park and Timothy Simons signed on to co-star later that month. Park plays the North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un and Simons the director of the talk show. Park was the first to audition for the role of Kim and got the part immediately. [...] Before filming began, Park gained 15 pounds and shaved his head to resemble Jong-un's <b>crew</b> <b>cut.</b> [...] His role was praised by critics. Although Rogen and Goldberg wrote the character of Kim as [...] "robotic and strict", Park instead played it [...] "sheepish and shy", which they found more humorous.
