ANT is intuitive and {{can be used in a}} graphical user interface or by interacting with the code through a defined application programming interface. ANT comes with full support for nonstandard, user-defined, or expanded genetic <b>codes</b> (<b>translation</b> tables), which is important because synthetic biology is being applied to an ever widening range of natural and engineered organisms. The Python source code for ANT is freely distributed so that it may be used without restriction, modified, and incorporated in other software or custom data pipelines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: General purpose {{modeling}} languages, such as UML, had a {{great impact}} on reliable software engineering. After realizing the need for automated code generation from models, the more appropriately customizable Domain-Specific Languages emerged. The creation of these languages requires metamodel-based environments, in which new languages can be designed in a visual way with minimal amount of <b>coding.</b> <b>Translations</b> between different domain-specific models can be performed automatically by model transformation systems if the necessary conversion steps are defined. Usually, model transformation systems store their models in memory, however in this way the model distribution is hardly possible. The performance of database-based modeling environments is considerably lower than those of in-memory versions. This paper introduces the steps of converting a database-based modeling system into a modeling environment that is able to work in both database and memory without having to duplicate the previously implemented algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Translation can be {{a problem}} area for {{researchers}} conducting qualitative studies in languages other than English who intend to publish the results in an English language journal. Analyzing the data is also complex when the research team consists of people from different language backgrounds. Translation must be considered as an issue in its own right to maintain the integrity of the research, especially in a grounded theory study. In this presentation we offer guidelines for the process of translation for data analysis in a grounded theory study in which the research was conducted in a language other than English (Indonesian). We make recommendations about procedures to choose when, who and how to translate data. The translation procedure is divided into four steps which are: translation in the process of <b>coding,</b> <b>translation</b> in the process of team discussion, translation in the process of advanced coding and ensuring the accuracy of translation...|$|R
