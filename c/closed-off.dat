Extra class passengers {{have access to a}} self-service counter with coffee, tea and the day's newspapers. Each train has also a <b>closed-off</b> conference compartment for business groups.|$|E
5|$|The new album, {{entitled}} The Liberty of Norton Folgate, {{was released}} a week later, on 18 May 2009. It charted at No.5 in the UK album charts. The band {{continued to play}} various festivals, including Pinkpop, Splendour, and Glastonbury. On 27 September 2009, the band also played a free concert on a <b>closed-off</b> Regent Street in association with Absolute Radio.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Evers-Emden {{published}} {{four books}} in Dutch {{based on her}} research. Geleende Kinderen (Borrowed Children) (1994) focused on the foster parents who hid the children. Ondergedoken Geweest, Een Afgesloten Verleden? (Hidden During the War: A <b>Closed-Off</b> Past?) (1995) examined the written responses of 300 hidden children to a questionnaire. Geschonden Bestaan (Shattered Existence) (1996) interviewed the parents who sent their children into hiding. Je ouders delen (Sharing Your Parents) (1999) focused on the foster siblings of the hidden children.|$|E
5|$|Lacke, who {{has lost}} {{everything}} because of Eli, tracks Eli down to the <b>closed-off</b> apartment. Breaking in, he discovers Eli asleep in the bathtub. He prepares to kill her, but Oskar, who was hiding inside the apartment, interferes; Eli immediately wakes up, jumps on Lacke and kills him, feeding on his blood. Eli thanks Oskar and kisses him in gratitude. However, an upstairs neighbor is angrily knocking on the ceiling due to the disturbance the fight has caused. Eli realizes {{that it is no}} longer safe to stay and leaves the same night.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the 63rd Street Line, {{including}} the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station, began on November 25, 1969. The station was built {{using a combination}} of cut-and-cover construction and tunneling machines. However, after the construction of the Second Avenue Subway ceased in 1975 due to the city's severe fiscal crisis, the BMT 63rd Street Line side, the northern tracks, basically led to a non-existent subway line, so the BMT side was abandoned and walled off with a temporary orange brick wall, and a false ceiling was placed on the upper level's IND 63rd Street Line side, the southern side. Finishing touches were only applied to the IND side of the station. The tracks on the <b>closed-off</b> BMT side were used only to store trains outside of rush hour.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back on Cybertron, Bumblebee {{struggles to}} {{maintain}} control, particularly after Ratbat's plots to have Skywarp assassinate him during a memorial for the Lost Light (which was presumed destroyed during its launch). Prowl and Arcee foil the attempted murder thanks to Starscream, who sees no benefit to restarting the war, {{and begins to}} work with Bumblebee and Metalhawk {{to form a new}} united government for Cybertron. Though many Decepticons are provided with jobs and fall into line, Bombshell continues with mysterious experiments that result in Prowl, {{at the end of his}} tether and increasingly emotionally <b>closed-off,</b> executing him. Fortunately, Ironhide is able to prevent chaos by successfully petitioning to have the I/D chips installed in the Decepticons turned off, restoring a sense of equality. Ironhide then recruits the Dinobots to join him in venturing into the wilderness to searching for the missing Aerialbots, only to go missing themselves. It is while they are being searched for by the other Autobots, Decepticons and NAILs that something else is discovered instead: a Metrotitan has returned to Cybertron, and it dubs Starscream the destined leader of the Transformer race. Before Starscream can exploit this new standing to any great extent, Megatron makes a surprising return and is taken into custody, causing the Decepticons to riot in the streets. It turns out that Megatron has secretly been working with a small team of Decepticons within Iacon to perfect the combination process, and he creates a new, more-powerful Devastator out of the Constructicons and Prowl, who has been under the mind-control of the still-living Bombshell. Ironhide, the Dinobots and the Aerialbots—now Superion—make a triumphant return to take Devastator down, while Megatron himself is neutralized by a failsafe created by Wheeljack. In the chaos, however, Starscream kills Metalhawk and uses his death to secure his position as sole ruler of Iacon, casting the Autobots and Decepticons out into the wilderness.|$|E

25|$|A {{ventilation}} {{structure for}} the IND line sits at {{the west end of}} the park at Sackman Street. There have been planning studies to build a new entrance in this area, or reopen an old <b>closed-off</b> one, though no evidence exists today of a prior exit.|$|E
25|$|A racing circuit, the Charade Circuit, {{close to}} the city, using <b>closed-off</b> public roads held the French Grand Prix in 1965, 1969, 1970 and 1972. It was a {{daunting}} circuit, with such harsh elevation changes that caused some drivers to be ill as they drove. Winners included Jim Clark, Jackie Stewart (twice), and Jochen Rindt.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{interior}} design is very efficient {{in the use}} of resources. Traditional and modern Japanese interiors have been flexible in use and designed mostly with natural materials. The spaces are used as multifunctional rooms. The rooms can be opened to create more space for a particular occasion or for more privacy, or vice versa <b>closed-off</b> by pulling closed paper screens called shōji.|$|E
25|$|Production was {{postponed}} with the break-out of the Second World War. There are unconfirmed claims that two partially completed trains were {{stored in the}} <b>closed-off</b> tunnel at Bøn {{for the duration of}} the war, to avoid German forces from accessing them. The first trial run of a motor unit took place from Oslo to Sarpsborg on 8 March 1945. The first complete three-car unit was tested from Strømmen to Kongsvinger on 12 July.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertical}} {{opening of a}} trawl net is created using flotation on the upper edge ("floatline") and weight on the lower edge ("footrope") of the net mouth. The configuration of the footrope varies based on the expected bottom shape. The more uneven the bottom, the more robust the footrope configuration must be to prevent net damage. This is used to catch shrimp, shellfish, cod, scallops and many others. Trawls are funnel-shaped nets that have a <b>closed-off</b> tail where the fish are collected and is open on the top end as the mouth.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} motivator {{of increased}} international trade was China's {{inclusion in the}} World Trade Organization (WTO) on December 11, 2001, leading to reduced or eliminated tariffs on much of China's agricultural exports. Due to the resulting opening of international markets to Chinese agriculture, by 2004 the value of China's agricultural exports exceeded $17.3 billion (US). Since China's inclusion in the WTO, its agricultural trade has not been liberalized {{to the same extent}} as its manufactured goods trade. Markets within China are still relatively <b>closed-off</b> to foreign companies. Due to its large and growing population, it is speculated that if its agricultural markets were opened, China would become a consistent net importer of food, possibly destabilizing the world food market. The barriers enforced by the Chinese government on grains are not transparent because China’s state trading in grains is conducted through its Cereal, Oil, and Foodstuffs Importing and Exporting Corporation (COFCO).|$|E
25|$|Even {{the most}} festive parades usually offer some aspect {{dedicated}} to remembering victims of AIDS and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and corporate sponsors, and promoted as major tourist attractions for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere {{in a nearby}} park or city-provided <b>closed-off</b> street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade {{can be hard to}} establish in some events, however in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.|$|E
25|$|Back in Arendelle {{after the}} meeting, Ingrid is {{determined}} to use Elsa by manipulating her to turn on Anna. She 'warns' Elsa that her sister is plotting to trap her inside the urn, just as Gerda did to Ingrid in the past, instructing Elsa to talk to Anna herself in the palace dungeon cell. Unknown to Ingrid, Elsa is only pretending to believe her aunt, and when she visits Anna in her jail cell, the two sisters decide it's best to play along with Ingrid's lie. The two {{come up with a}} plan to place Ingrid back inside the urn when she least expects it; so Elsa breaks Anna out of the cell, and with help from Kristoff they search the <b>closed-off</b> east wing of the castle, and find the urn in a closet (along with a still-frozen Hans). They also find a cracked mirror with a missing fragment, which unknown to them, is the Mirror of Shattered Sight. Anna takes the urn into her cell to wait for Ingrid to come check on her. Unfortunately, Ingrid was on to their scheme; she had been waiting for Anna all along, and Anna finds herself trapped in the cell with her.|$|E

500|$|During these years, much of {{his work}} {{expressed}} left-wing views, and he became widely known as a political poet although he was privately more ambivalent about revolutionary politics than many reviewers recognised, and Mendelson argues that he expounded political views partly {{out of a sense}} of moral duty and partly because it enhanced his reputation, and that he later regretted having done so. He generally wrote about revolutionary change in terms of a [...] "change of heart", a transformation of a society from a <b>closed-off</b> psychology of fear to an open psychology of love.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{reason why}} I {{chose to do}} the {{recording}} in London this time was because I wanted to make an album in a <b>closed-off</b> environment, {{sort of like a}} place where sunlight doesn't reach. The songs this time are like me. They're not liberal and open-minded. The songs which I've always made often share the same views and ideas as the listener, but this time, they're more like shouts and prayers from my individual innermost self. With this image, I've probably gotten closer to how I was like inside when I first debuted. What I do in America has always been liberal and open, so that's why I chose London this time instead..." ...|$|E
500|$|Knight and his wife, {{many years}} later, {{are taking their}} granddaughter Rhoda to the American Museum of Natural History. Knight, {{well-known}} to the staff, is visiting the <b>closed-off</b> areas {{to have a look}} at the new mammoth specimens: the girl, however, is eager to see more of her grandfather's paintings. During this, the staff are finally getting round to sorting out Marsh's long-neglected collection of fossils. Two of the workers discover Knight's Leaping Laelaps has been accidentally left in the storeroom yesterday. The painting is taken back downstairs while the workmen unknowingly leave Cope's skeleton and Marsh's parts behind: [...] "The rest of this stuff is stayin' put for who knows how long, but we don't want that to get buried." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{the former}} MB line from Clifton to Rawtenstall was inaugurated on Friday 25 September 1846. [...] Surveyed {{two days earlier}} by the Inspector-General of railways, Charles Pasley, who was {{reportedly}} satisfied with the project, upwards of 1,000invitations were delivered to local people, shareholders and other interested parties. [...] They gathered at the new Hunts Bank station in Manchester. [...] Leaving Manchester, the train stopped near Philips Park to collect chairman John Hodges, before continuing to Radcliffe Bridge to collect more passengers. [...] Large crowds were gathered along {{the course of the}} railway. [...] In Bury, the train was extended to about 30carriages and three engines, and more passengers were collected before the train finished its journey in Rawtenstall. [...] Passengers were provided with a large meal in a <b>closed-off</b> section of a power-loom shed owned by John Robinson Kay. [...] They listened to several celebratory speeches, before re-embarking the train to head home. [...] The railway was opened to the general public on the following Monday.|$|E
500|$|The deep-level {{platforms}} {{were opened}} on 15 December 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP, now the Piccadilly line) which ran between Finsbury Park and Hammersmith. The platforms are placed eastbound above westbound and were originally served by lifts from street level stopping at both platform levels. Eastbound GNP trains and DR trains would have {{shared the same}} platform with the two routes separating at a junction immediately {{to the east of}} the station. Westbound trains would have had separate platforms at the lower level with the routes merging at a junction west of the station. Although construction of the section of the DR tube route east of South Kensington had been postponed, a partial, [...] long, section of the westbound DR platform was built along with the two for GNP use. Though <b>closed-off</b> {{from the rest of the}} station, it was linked to the lift lobby and was tiled to match the other platforms. Enlarged tunnel sections for the junctions were constructed with the original running tunnels and remain visible from passing trains. A new surface building on Pelham Street for the lifts was designed by Leslie Green with the GNP's distinctive ox-blood red glazed terracotta façade.|$|E
500|$|The series {{makes use}} of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. Beginning with the second season, visual effects became an {{in-house}} department. Visual effects supervisor Ivan Hayden feels this improved the series because a fixed budget allowed them to compensate for other scenes that lacked effects, such as in [...] "Nightshifter". Wide shots of the bank's exterior—featuring <b>closed-off</b> streets, police, and SWAT helicopters—were accomplished with visual effects. The series' catchphrase—"Scary just got sexy"—was added to a billboard in the background. For the episode [...] "Houses of the Holy", production did not want viewers {{to be able to}} determine that the [...] "angel" [...] was in actuality a priest. Thus, the shape engulfed in light was a girl wearing a skintight white leotard. At times, the visual effects used were subtle. Cockroaches were digitally inserted into the sewer scenes of [...] "No Exit"; director Kim Manners did not ask for it, but thought the addition [...] "made it really creepy". The episode [...] "Playthings" [...] featured a scene of a man dying after falling down stairs. The department added blood flowing from underneath him, and also made his fingers twitch and his mouth open and close to create a more lifelike appearance.|$|E
500|$|... "Loin Like a Hunting Flame" [...] {{received}} mostly negative {{reviews from}} critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five, finding Mann's writing to lack tension and imagination. Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode [...] "has good moments, and is at least efficient and watchable", but believed that it [...] "doesn't really deliver anything special, doesn't try to be anything other than average". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated [...] "Loin Like a Hunting Flame" [...] 4 out of 5, describing it as being [...] "handled in a subtle, somber manner". Gibron felt that [...] "the events unfold in this episode evenly and eerily", and it serves {{as an example of}} [...] "what could have been done had the show's focus, both literally and metaphysically, remained on crime". Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode an F, calling it [...] "quite possibly one of the worst episodes of television I've ever seen". VanDerWerff felt that the episode's wariness of the 1990s rave subculture was particularly dated. He also felt that [...] "Loin Like a Hunting Flame" [...] served as a prominent example of Millennium [...] "social conservatism", noting that it seems [...] "fairly <b>closed-off</b> from other points-of-view" [...] than that of the character Frank Black.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{proposed}} pilot, Mal was much darker and considerably more <b>closed-off.</b> Fox network executives objected, {{and asked that}} Mal be [...] "lightened up". For the second episode ("The Train Job"), Whedon created a more [...] "jolly" [...] Mal Reynolds.|$|E

2500|$|The first part, [...] "The Thieving Magpie", {{begins with}} Toru Okada, a low-key {{unemployed}} man, who is tasked by his wife, Kumiko, {{to find their}} missing cat. Kumiko suggests starting by looking in the alley, a <b>closed-off</b> strip of land existing behind their house. After Toru has hung {{out there for a}} while with no luck, May Kasahara, who had been watching him camping out the alley for some time, questions him. She then invites him over to her house in order to sit on the patio and look over an abandoned house that she says is a popular hangout for stray cats. The abandoned house is revealed to possibly contain some strange omen, as it had brought bad luck to all of its prior tenants. It also contains an empty well, which Toru uses later on to crawl into and think.|$|E
2500|$|Nixon's successor, Gerald R. Ford, {{appointed}} Bush {{head of the}} U.S. Liaison Office in the Peoples Republic of China in 1974, {{and thus}} the Bushes moved internationally. [...] Barbara enjoyed her time spent in China, and often rode bicycles with her husband to explore the cities and regions that few Americans had traveled to. [...] Just three years later Bush was recalled to the U.S. to serve as Director of Central Intelligence during a crucial time of legal uncertainty for the agency. [...] Her husband {{was not allowed to}} share pertinent aspects of his job with Barbara, as they were classified; the ensuing sense of isolation, coupled with her perception that she was not achieving her goals while other women of her time were, plunged her into a depression. [...] She did not seek professional help and instead began delivering speeches and presentations about her time spent in the <b>closed-off</b> China and began volunteering at a hospice.|$|E
2500|$|The trope {{of masculinity}} {{continued}} in season two. Vox's Todd VanDerWerff stated, [...] "...above all else, True Detective wants {{to explore the}} role of men in society." [...] "Yet if season one was already interested in the topic, then season two has nearly jumped off the cliff with its obsessions, {{to the degree that}} Rachel McAdams's Ani is defined largely by her rejection of the more open and traditionally [...] "feminine" [...] New Age philosophy of her father and her embrace of the hardened, traditionally [...] "masculine" [...] life of the emotionally <b>closed-off</b> police officer," [...] he continued. VanDerWerff also noted that season two's three male leads are all dealing with their own issues of masculinity; [...] "Ray seems tortured by having to exist as a man in this world that doesn't share his ideals," [...] "Frank is trying to walk a very noble, masculine path by taking his dark, dirty enterprise legitimate," [...] and [...] " [...] is mostly playing out a very typical story of a deeply repressed gay man who's trying to fight back his own impulses." ...|$|E
