We {{show that}} a minimal {{dependent}} type theory based on Σtypes and equality is degenerated in presence of <b>computational</b> classical <b>logic.</b> By <b>computational</b> classical <b>logic</b> is meant a classical logic derived from a control operator equipped with reduction rules {{similar to the ones}} of Felleisen’s C or Parigot’s µ operators. As a consequence, formalisms such as Martin-Löf’s type theory or the (Set-predicative variant of the) Calculus of Inductive Constructions are inconsistent in presence of <b>computational</b> classical <b>logic.</b> Besides, an analysis {{of the role of the}} η-rule for control operators through a set-theoretic model of <b>computational</b> classical <b>logic</b> is given...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} logical gates in quantum {{computation}} has suggested {{new forms of}} quantum <b>logic,</b> called quantum <b>computational</b> <b>logics.</b> The basic semantic idea is the following: {{the meaning of a}} sentence is identified with a quregister (a system of qubits) or, more gener-ally, with a mixture of quregisters (called qumix). In this framework, any sentence α of the language gives rise to a quantum tree: a kind of quantum circuit that transforms the quregister (qumix) associated to the atomic subformulas of α into the quregister (qumix) associated to α. A variant of the quantum computational semantics is represented by the quantum holistic semantics, which permits us to represent entangled meanings.

2500|$|By this time, Wittgenstein's {{view on the}} {{foundations}} of mathematics had changed considerably. In his early 20s, Wittgenstein had thought logic could provide a solid foundation, and he had even considered updating Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica. Now he denied there were any mathematical facts to be discovered. He gave a series of lectures on mathematics, discussing this and other topics, documented in a book, with lectures by Wittgenstein and discussions between him and several students, including the young Alan Turing who described Wittgenstein as [...] "a very peculiar man". The two had many discussions {{about the relationship between}} <b>computational</b> <b>logic</b> and everyday notions of truth.|$|E

40|$|Quantum {{computation}} {{has suggested}} {{new forms of}} quantum <b>logic,</b> called quantum <b>computational</b> <b>logics.</b> The basic semantic idea is the following: {{the meaning of a}} sentence is identified with a quregister, a system of qubits, representing a possible pure state of a compound quantum system. The generalization to mixed states, which might be useful to analyse entanglement-phenomena, is due to Gudder. Quantum <b>computational</b> <b>logics</b> represent non standard examples of unsharp quantum logic, where the non-contradiction principle is violated, while conjunctions and disjunctions are strongly non-idempotent.

40|$|Abstract. In quantum <b>computational</b> <b>logics</b> {{meanings}} of sentences are identified with quantum information quantities: systems of qubits or, more generally, mixtures of systems of qubits. We consider {{two kinds of}} quantum computational semantics: 1) a compositional semantics, where {{the meaning of a}} compound sentence is determined by the {{meanings of}} its parts; 2) a holistic semantics, which makes essential use of the characteristic “holistic ” features of the quantum-theoretic formalism. The compositional and the holistic semantics turn out to characterize the same logic. In this framework, one can introduce the notion of quantum-classical truth table, which corresponds to the most natural way for a quantum computer to calculate classical tautologies. Quantum <b>computational</b> <b>logics</b> can be applied to investigate differ-ent kinds of semantic phenomena where holistic, contextual and gestaltic patterns play an essential role (from natural languages to musical com...|$|R
40|$|Quantum <b>computational</b> <b>logics</b> (QCLs) are {{new forms}} of quantum logic, that {{represent}} a natural logical abstraction from the theory of logical gates in quantum computation ([1]). In these logics formulas denote quantum in-formation quantities (qubits, quregisters or mixtures of quregisters), while the logical connectives are interpreted as special quantum logical gates (uni-tary operators of convenient Hilbert spaces). As a consequence, any formula {{can be regarded as}} an economical description of a quantum circuit ([2]). The standard semantics of QCLs {{does not take into account}} any approximation methods, which instead play an important role in a number of quantum com-putational problems ([4], [3]). We investigate a class of new QCLs, called approximate quantum <b>computational</b> <b>logics</b> (ApQCLs), where the notions of truth and of logical consequence essentially depend on an approximation-degree. One can prove the existence of uncountably many ApQCLs tha...|$|R
