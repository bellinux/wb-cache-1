40|$|AbstractThe general aim of {{this paper}} is to propose the {{development}} of a methodological framework that incorporates the various factors affecting the Dwell Time (DT) of containers in container terminals. Container terminals are regarded as a key element of logistics chains since they are a link between sea and the hinterland transportation modes. Workload forecasting is essential when it comes to truck arrivals for the avoidance of bottlenecks and the smooth integration of container terminals in the supply chain. Terminal operators, tend to make stacking decisions based on mostly on factors suc the container's weight, size and type. The suggested methodology requires the collection of aggregate data and the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to identify the determinants of Dwell Time (DT). The first results of the ANN showed that the most important factors affecting significantly the model's accuracy are the following: <b>containers</b> <b>size</b> and type, the day and month of the container's discharge, the vessel's port of origin and the commodities transported...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Many {{manufacturing}} companies that ship goods through full container loads found themselves under-utilizing the containers and resulting in higher carbon footprint per volume shipment. One {{of the reasons}} is the choice of non-ideal <b>container</b> <b>sizes</b> for their shipments. Consolidation fills up the containers more efficiently that reduces the overall carbon footprint. The objective {{of this paper is to}} support decisions on selection of appropriate combination of <b>container</b> <b>sizes</b> and shipment consolidation for a manufacturing company. We develop two-steps model which first takes the volumes to be shipped as an input and provide the combination of <b>container</b> <b>sizes</b> required; then evaluate possibility of shipment consolidation from multiple ports (of loading) within the same country to the same destination (port of discharge). In both steps, the objective function is to minimize carbon footprint by applying linear/integer programming. Only consolidation within the same country is considered due to practical considerations to avoid the need for cross border clearances. Design/Methodology/Approach: In this paper, we first provide an Integer Programming model to minimize the companies’ shipping carbon footprints by selecting the ideal <b>container</b> <b>sizes</b> appropriate for their shipment volumes. Secondly, we proposed a strategy to minimize the carbon footprint by consolidating the shipments in the same country from multiple domestic locations at a port of loading by road freight, before the international sea shipment. A mixed-Integer Programming model has been developed to determine if one should ship each shipment separately or have shipments consolidated first before being shipped. Findings: Computational results using real-world data will be showcased. Originality/Value: Optimize the <b>container</b> <b>size</b> for shipment for a manufacturing company and consolidating the shipments within the same country. Practical Implications: We verify our model with a real-world business case (and data) in the consumer product manufacturing industry. By applying the proposed approach and models, the company can reduce the carbon footprint by 13. 4 % by using the optimal <b>container</b> <b>size</b> and further reduce the carbon footprint by 12. 1 % from consolidation of shipments as compared to the current practice without optimization...|$|R
40|$|Human’s {{impact on}} earth through {{global warming is}} more or less an {{accepted}} fact. Ocean freight is estimated to contribute 4 - 5 % of global carbon emissions and manufacturing companies can aid in reducing this amount. Many companies that ship goods through full container loads do not have the capabilities to ensure the containers they are using minimizes their carbon footprint. One of the reasons is the choice of non-ideal <b>container</b> <b>sizes</b> for their shipments. This paper provides a mathematical model to minimize companies’ shipping carbon footprints by selecting the ideal <b>container</b> <b>sizes</b> appropriate for their shipment volumes. Using data from a selected real-world business case in the manufacturing industry, we show that our model can provide a 13. 4 % reduction in carbon footprint. We believe that our model is generic for ocean shipment and can be easily adoptable by other manufacturing companies, to be more environmentally sustainable by selecting the appropriate <b>container</b> <b>sizes</b> and reduce the carbon footprint of their ocean freight...|$|R

The experimental set-up was completely randomized design. The morphological parameters determined were number of leaves, plant height, stem diameter, shoot and root dry weights, whole plant dry weight and root to shoot ratio while the physiological ones were CO 2 assimilation rate substomatal CO 2 concentration, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance and soil respiration. The results showed that <b>container</b> <b>size</b> significantly (p≤ 0. 05) increased plant height, canopy height, shoot and root dry weight, whole plant dry weight and root to shoot ratio, number of leaves. Irrigation frequency significantly (p≤ 0. 05) increased, number of leaves, plant height, root and shoot dry weight, root to shoot ratio, whole plant dry weight but did not affect canopy height and stem diameter.

40|$|We {{consider}} multistage, stochastic {{production systems}} using pull control for production authorization in discrete parts manufacturing. These {{systems have been}} widely implemented {{in recent years and}} constitute a significant aspect of lean manufacturing. Extensive research has appeared on the optimal sizing of buffer inventory levels in such systems. However the issue of control points, i. e. where in the multistage sequence to locate the output buffers, has not been addressed for pull systems. Allowable container/batch sizes, optimal inventory levels, and ability of systems to automatically adjust to stochastic demand depend on the location of these control points. We begin by examining a serial production system producing a single part type. Two models are examined in this regard. In the first, <b>container</b> <b>size</b> is independent of the control section, while in the second, <b>container</b> <b>sizes</b> are section dependent. Additionally, a nesting policy is introduced which introduces the additional constraint that the <b>container</b> <b>size</b> in a section is related to the <b>container</b> <b>size</b> in any other section by a power of two. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for ensuring that a single, end-of-line accumulation point is optimal. When this is not the case, an algorithm is provided to determine the optimal control points. Effects of factors such as value added structure, fixed location cost, setup and material handling cost, kanban collection time, and material transportation time on the control structure are investigated. Results are extended to determine the optimal <b>container</b> <b>size</b> when lead time at a stage is a concave function of <b>container</b> <b>size.</b> The study is then extended to a multi-product case. Queuing aspects are introduced to account for the interaction between the different part types. The queuing model used is a modification of the Decomposition/Recomposition model described in Shantikumar and Buzacott (1981). The models in the chapter do not assume a serial structure any longer. Additionally, general interarrival and service time distributions are considered. The effect of number of products, demand arrival distribution, value added structure, and number of stages on the control structure and system cost is investigated. Finally, a simulation model is developed in Chapter 5 to verify and validate the mathematical models described in Chapters 3 and 4...|$|R

40|$|This study {{illustrates}} {{the use of}} ACNielsen Homescan Panel (HSD) in three separate demand analyses of dairy products: (1) the effect of using cross-sectional data in a New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO) study of ice cream firm mergers in San Antonio; (2) the estimation of hedonic price models for fluid milk by quart, halfgallon and gallon container sizes; (3) the estimation of a demand system including white milk, flavored milk, carbonated soft drinks, bottled water, and fruit juice by various <b>container</b> <b>sizes.</b> In the NEIO study a standard LA/AIDS demand system was used to estimate elasticities evaluating seven simulated mergers of ice cream manufactures in San Antonio in 1999. Unlike previously published NEIO work, {{it is the first}} to use crosssectional data to address the issue associated with inventory effects. Using the method developed by Capps, Church and Love, none of the simulated price effects associated with the mergers was statistically different from zero at the 5 % confidence level. In 1995 Nerlove proposed a quantity-dependent hedonic model as a viable alternative to the conventional price-dependent hedonic model as a means to ascertain consumer willingness to pay for the characteristics of a given good. We revisited Nerlove?s work validating his model using transactional data indigenous to the HSD. Hedonic models, both price-dependent and quantity-dependent, were estimated for the characteristics of fat content, container type, and brand designation for the <b>container</b> <b>sizes</b> of gallon, half- gallon, and quart. A rigorous explanation of the interpretation between the estimates derived from the two hedonic models was discussed. Using the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), a matrix of own-price, crossprice, and expenditure elasticities was estimated involving various <b>container</b> <b>sizes</b> of white milk, flavored milk, carbonated soft drinks, bottled water, and fruit juices, using a cross-section of the 1999 HSD. We described price imputations and the handling of censored observations to develop the respective elasticities.

40|$|With container-grown trees {{offered to}} the public in an {{increasing}} array of sizes, it is important {{to determine the effects of}} transplant on different <b>size</b> <b>container</b> stock. Transplant shock is a condition of physiological stress, which is a normal consequence of transplanting plants into conditions less favorable than those in the nursery. Clonal replicates of Vitex agnus-castus L., Acer rubrum L. var. drummondii (Hook. & Arn. ex Nutt.) Sarg., and Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich. were grown under common conditions in each of five <b>container</b> <b>sizes</b> # 1, 3, 7, 25, or 45 (3. 5, 11. 7, 23. 3 97. 8, or 175. 0 L, respectively) to minimize residual differences during production. Beginning June 2013, six trees of each <b>container</b> <b>size</b> and species were transplanted to a sandy clay loam field in College Station, Texas. To determine the extent of transplant shock, physiological stress was assessed through xylem water potentials and photosynthetic gas exchange rates. Changes in shoot growth of each tree were calculated along with root growth for two growing seasons. Utilizing industry standards, the initial costs of materials and labor were then compared with the size of trees two years post-transplant to determine return on investment for each <b>container</b> <b>size.</b> Responses observed in A. rubrum and V. agnus-castus indicted growth increased exponentially in # 3 and # 7 container-grown trees. Taxodium distichum recovered at much slower rates, with less rapid although still vigorous growth in # 3 and # 7 container-grown trees. Data indicates all trees in # 3 and # 7 containers experienced less severe water stresses and required less time to return to normal transpiration rates than trees grown in other containers. The reduced stress levels and increased growth rates correlated with greater percent changes found in root lengths of smaller container-grown trees. Economic analysis after two growing seasons indicated a greater increase in value for # 3 and # 7 container-grown trees versus losses in value for some # 45 container-grown trees. In comparison with trees from larger containers, trees from smaller <b>size</b> <b>containers</b> exhibited reduced transplant shock, decreased establishment time and increased growth rates, thus creating a quicker return on investment for trees transplanted from the smaller <b>container</b> <b>sizes...</b>|$|R
