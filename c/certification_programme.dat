25|$|Overall {{development}} of the Il-86 occupied over a decade. The length of this period {{was due to the}} sensitivity of the airliner's configuration, problems with its powerplant, prolonged avionics development and the low priority of civil as opposed to military aircraft. In its earlier stages, the Il-86 programme was also held back by hopes of US airliner imports. Certificating the Il-86 to the very demanding set of Soviet and Comecon standards called NLGS-2 also delayed progress; it was the first Soviet aircraft to undergo a full <b>certification</b> <b>programme</b> since certification was introduced in the USSR in 1967 and became mandatory five years later.|$|E
