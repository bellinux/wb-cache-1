25|$|A clothes hanger, or coat hanger, is {{a device}} {{in the shape}} of human {{shoulders}} designed to facilitate the hanging of a coat, jacket, sweater, shirt, blouse, or dress in a manner that prevents wrinkles, with a lower bar for the hanging of trousers or skirts. The shoulder-shaped wire hanger, was inspired by a <b>coat</b> <b>hook</b> invented in 1869 by O. A. North of New Britain, Connecticut.|$|E

5000|$|The {{exterior}} and interior shapes echoed prior Newson designs for round-cornered rectangular dish racks, furniture and spoke-and-hub lamps. The concept also incorporated many innovations in the interior such as four seats, with the front two seats swiveling on pedestals; a jewel-like dashboard that moved vertically to accommodate drivers of differing heights; and, when the light was switched on, an electro-luminescent film glowed snowy white across the ceiling. The dashboard dials were built by Newson's Ikepod watch company and the steering wheel was reminiscent of his 1997 Alessi <b>coat</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E

He cut off Peter's shadow so the boy could not fly, combed the imagination out of his hair, and choked him with the white Eton tie.

5000|$|Despite its French {{etymology}} (modern spelling: portemanteau), portmanteau is {{not used}} in French in this context. It is indeed a false friend. It refers to a coat stand or <b>coat</b> <b>hook</b> (literally a [...] "coat support"), {{but in the past}} it could also refer to a cloth drape knight would use to pack their gear. It was in this context that it first came to its English use, and the metaphorical use for a linguistic phenomenon (putting one word inside another, as into a case) is an English coinage. The French linguistic term mot-valise, literally a [...] "suitcase-word", is a relatively recent back-translation from English, attested only since 1970.|$|E
5000|$|Some historians believe President Thomas Jefferson {{invented a}} forerunner {{of the wooden}} clothes hanger. However, today's most-used hanger, the shoulder-shaped wire hanger, was {{inspired}} by a <b>coat</b> <b>hook</b> that was invented in 1869 by O. A. North of New Britain, Connecticut. An employee of the Timberlake Wire and Novelty Company, Albert J. Parkhouse of Jackson, Michigan has also been credited with the invention. The story goes that one morning in 1903, Parkhouse arrived to work to find that all coat hooks were taken. Annoyed, he took a piece of wire, bent it into the shape we would recognize today, and hung his coat. [...] Also credited is Christopher Cann in 1876 as an engineering student at Boston University.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} primary entrances to U.N.C.L.E. headquarters. In the daytime, field agents are {{admitted}} {{by way of}} Del Floria's, a small, nondescript tailor/dry-cleaning shop located one flight below street level. The agents go to the single fitting booth and turn the <b>coat</b> <b>hook</b> on the back wall. Outside in the shop, an operator activates a mechanism on the pressing machine that releases the disguised armored door. The wall swings inward and an agent finds him/herself in the main admissions area. There, a receptionist pins on a security badge (white or later, yellow for highest security clearance; red and green for low clearance and visitors). A chemical on the receptionist's fingers activates the badge. There are also entrances through the Men's and Women's lockers {{at the rear of}} the parking garage (admissions for non-field personnel). After hours, when Del Floria's is closed, agents may also enter through the Masque Club or through the offices of the charitable organization.|$|E
5000|$|In 1975, Billy's girlfriend Susan {{comes to}} see him. Devastated {{at what has}} {{happened}} to Billy, she tells him that he has to escape or else he will die in there. She leaves him a scrapbook with money hidden inside as [...] "a picture of your good friend Mr. Franklin from the bank", hoping Billy can use it to help him escape. Her visit moves Billy strongly, and he regains his senses. He says goodbye to Max, telling him not to die and promising to come back for him. He bribes Hamidou into taking him to the sanatorium, where there are no guards. Instead, Hamidou takes Billy past the sanatorium to another room—and prepares to rape him. Fighting back, Billy inadvertently kills Hamidou by pushing him onto a <b>coat</b> <b>hook.</b> He seizes the opportunity to escape by putting on a guard's uniform and walking out of the front door. In the epilogue, it is explained that—on the night of October 4, 1975—he successfully crossed the border to Greece, and arrived home three weeks later.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{generally}} a mild-mannered (if somewhat oblivious) figure, Calculus flies into an uncharacteristic rage {{if he feels}} insulted or ridiculed. He is especially provoked if he ever hears Haddock (or anyone else) call him a [...] "goat". On one famous occasion in Destination Moon, he displays uncontrollable ire ("Goat, am I?") when an irritated Haddock accuses him of [...] "acting the goat" [...] ("acting like a goat" [...] in the Golden Press American English translation) by attempting to build a Moon rocket. His subsequent tirade and blatant disregard for security terrifies the usually ebullient Captain; he even lifts the director of security barring his way onto a <b>coat</b> <b>hook.</b> Another occasion is in Flight 714 to Sydney when, due to some misunderstanding, he physically assaults Laszlo Carreidas {{and has to be}} held back with great effort by Haddock and Tintin. In the same book, despite his deafness, he hears Captain Haddock tell him that he's [...] "acting the goat", but Haddock quickly prevents the severe reaction from occurring quickly. Earlier in Red Rackham's Treasure Calculus is shown with a frown for a few moments when he thinks that the Captain lied to him that Tintin had gone for a row, when Tintin actually was diving to search for treasure. Despite his gentle nature, Calculus is rather sensitive about his work and does not appreciate being ridiculed or belittled for his scientific efforts.|$|E

40|$|A popular {{favourite}} of {{the contemporary}} internet is the curious facial recognition performed upon everyday things and places – a cheese grater, parking meter, <b>coat</b> <b>hook</b> – examples of which are frequently shared via social networks using an #iseefaces hashtag. There are countless blogs and Flickr pools devoted to the idea (including one from British comedian Dave Gorman), and even a calendar featuring Francois Robert’s many photographs of the faces he discerned amongst mops, sockets, hinges, and cameras, a marbled sponge cake or a lemon… It even featured in the arguably more highbrow context of the 2013 Venice Biennale when Roger Callois’ collection of ‘pictorial stones’ were exhibited; they included an agate wherein one easily discerns a ghostly little creature, to which has been assigned the name Le Petit Fantôme… This phenomenon of pareidolia – the term originates from the Greek ‘para’ (παρά - beside or beyond) and ‘eidōlon’ (εἴδωλον - form or image) – occurs because the human visual system {{has a tendency to}} extract patterns from noise, thus perceiving ‘meaning’ in random source material. In my paper I am interested to use this current fascination for pareidolia as the occasion to think about our desire to read meaning and significance into things. As an artist/scholar working with the everyday, rather than attempting to pin down definitive interpretations, I am interested in enlarging what can be generated from the ordinary objects and materials that surround us. My desire for richer, multiplied possibilities takes up Michel Foucault’s assertion that as academics we are suffering from ‘channels that are too narrow, skimpy, quasi-monopolistic, insufficient’, and his suggestion that ‘we must multiply the paths and the possibility of comings and goings [...] . ’ My own attempt to do so occurs through an independent serial publication, the Pam Flett Press, each issue of which begins by recognising some instance of everyday life (graffiti on urban walls, the ubiquitous plastic bag, the scatter of gum on city pavements, the pareidolic desire to see faces in ordinary objects…) before using this as a means with which to think creatively and critically. The current paper focuses upon instances from issue # 5 ‘I see faces’ and posits making as a making-one’s-way-into-understanding the everyday, before suggesting that using the everyday as material can in turn rethink academic and creative work. </p...|$|E
