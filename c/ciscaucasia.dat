5000|$|This hamster {{occurs on}} the {{northern}} slopes of the Caucasus and <b>Ciscaucasia,</b> between Dagestan, the Don River and the Sea of Azov.

It is found in grassy steppes and also mountain steppes at elevations from 1600 to 2300 m above sea level. It favours pasture and cultivated land and also occurs in belts of trees and rough grass between fields but not in dense woodland.|$|E
5000|$|The {{culture is}} {{closely linked to}} the {{approximately}} contemporaneous Maykop culture of <b>Ciscaucasia.</b> As Amjad Jaimoukha puts it,"The Kura-Araxes culture was contiguous, and had mutual influences, with the Maikop culture in the Northwest Caucasus. According to E.I. Krupnov (1969:77), there were elements of the Maikop culture in the early memorials of Chechnya and Ingushetia in the Meken and Bamut kurgans and in Lugovoe in Serzhen-Yurt. Similarities between some features and objects of the Maikop and Kura-Araxes cultures, such as large square graves, the bold-relief curvilinear ornamentation of pottery, ochre-coloured ceramics, earthen hearth props with horn projections, flint arrowheads, stone axes and copper pitchforks are indicative of a cultural unity that pervaded the Caucasus in the Neolithic Age." ...|$|E
50|$|The western {{border of}} the European polecat's range in the former Soviet Union begins {{from the mouth of}} the Danube in the south {{approximately}} to northwest of Suoyarvi, on the Finnish border in the north. In Karelia, its northern border extends from the former point towards the southeast to the Spassk Bay of Lake Onega, thereby passing around the West Karelian uplands from the south and then, passing around these uplands from the east, it suddenly ascends directly to the north passing in particular, near the western shore of Segozer and reaches Rugozer. From there, the border line turns northeast, crossing the Lakhta and reaching Kem on the White Sea. From Archangelsk, the border reaches Mezen, thus attaining the species' most northerly range. From the Mezen River's mouth, the border abruptly returns south, approaching closer to the upper Mezen near 64° lat. From there, the polecat's northern border goes on to the upper Vychegda River, and descends further on southwards and in the Urals. Its eastern range apparently extends along the Urals, embracing Sverdlovsk from the west. It is probably absent in the southern Urals, where the steppe polecat occurs. The southern {{border of the}} polecat's range starts in the west of the Danube's mouth and extends eastward along the coast of the Black Sea reaching the mouth of the Dnepr, from which it moves back from the shore of the Azov Sea and, along it, goes to the mouth of the Don. From the mouth and lower course of the Don, its range passes into the steppe region of western and middle <b>Ciscaucasia.</b> The European polecat is absent from the Saratov steppes of Transvolga, instead being encountered only in the extreme lower Bolshoy and Maly Irgiz Rivers. Further on, the border goes to the north along the Volga River. It steeply returns east somewhat south at the Samara bend, passing around Obshchy Syrt, reaching the Urals at the latitude of Magnitogorsk. The range of the polecat within the former Soviet Union has expanded northwards. From 1930-1952 for example, the polecat colonised northwestern Karelia and southern Finland.|$|E
5000|$|Łobodowski {{was born}} on 19 March 1909 in the lands of Partitioned Poland on the (relatively modest) Purwiszki {{farmstead}} of his father, Władysław Łobodowski, a colonel in the Imperial Russian Army, and his wife Stefanja Łobodowska, née Doborejko-Jarząbkiewicz. Of the Łobodowskis' four children [...] three daughters and one son [...] two daughters died in childhood, leaving Józef and his surviving (elder) sister Władysława. In 1910 the Łobodowskis were obliged to sell their country estate and moved to Lublin. In 1914, owing to {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, Władysław Łobodowski was transferred together with his family to Moscow as a measure taken by the Imperial Russian Army to shield its officer corps from the hostilities of war. It is to this period of his early schooling in Moscow that Łobodowski owed his excellent knowledge of the Russian language. However, the upheavals of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 soon forced the family to flee for their lives to Yeysk in the Kuban region of the <b>Ciscaucasia,</b> where [...] drastically reduced in their means [...] they suffered severe privations for five years, including hunger. In this place and in these conditions Łobodowski passed the for&shy;ma&shy;tive years of his life between the ages of 8 and 13, at times forced by circumstances into wheeling and dealing in the town's streets to help the family survive. The name [...] "Kuban", as a reference to the broadly conceived world of the Kuban Cossacks, crops up in all discussions of Łobodowski's life and creative oeuvre as the single most sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant toponym of his entire biography. The Kuban period will be fictionalized in his 1955 novel Komysze ("The Bushmen"), a text which paints a faithful and seductively vivid picture of the last months of freedom and decadence in Russia in a secluded port in the Zakubanskie Marshes on the Sea of Azov. It is also here, in the Kuban, that Łobo&shy;dow&shy;ski first came in contact with Ukrainian culture, owing to the presence in the region of the Zaporozhian Cossacks who had been resettled there after the banning of the Zaporizhian Sich by Catherine II in 1775.However, the Kuban, and Yeysk in particular did not prove a safe haven for the family, and here his father, Władysław Łobodowski, was at last arrested by the Bolsheviks: although eventually released through the intervention of a former comrade-in-arms from the Imperial Russian Army who had crossed over the new ideological divide, he died there of natural causes on 4 March 1922 and is buried in town. Thereupon Łobodowski's mother, Stefanja Łobodowska, decided to take her three surviving children (one daughter had already died earlier) to the nascent Second Polish Republic, a long and perilous journey which claimed the life of another of her children, a second daughter, hurriedly buried along the way in an unmarked grave. Thus reduced in numbers and deprived of means of support, the family settled once again in Lublin, in an establishment owned by Stefanja Łobodowska's stepsister, Łobodowski's aunt.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aim. Forest flora of the Central <b>Ciscaucasia</b> in General is a relict, {{geographically}} {{situated in}} the steppe zone.  Composing flora elements have different types of habitats, concentrated in the natural physical-geographical unit where isolated from the main habitats. Comparative analysis of the geographic, ecological and systematic components of forest flora will provide data about the correlation of these parameters identify the leading group.  Location. The Central <b>Ciscaucasia</b> Methods. We made the geographical and systematic ranges of forest flora of the Central <b>Ciscaucasia</b> and their comparative analysis is conducted. Results. Geographical analysis of forest flora of the Central <b>Ciscaucasia</b> revealed 16 geographical elements, grouped in 6 categories, among which is the predominant group of boreal geographical elements. It is established that the leading geographical elements are Euro-Caucasian, Caucasian and Sub-Caucasian, numbering 189 species, and are half of the flora. Comparison with ecological spectrum showed that the sequence geographical elements completely different, here leading positions are occupied Northern species as ecologically more conservative, and the Caucasian demonstrate ecological plasticity. In a systematic relation matched warheads geographical and systematic spectra.  The scope of the results. The results {{may be used in}} comparative Floristics, in its theoretical part in adjusting the models of the Genesis of the flora. Conclusions. Thus, half of the geographical elements of the forest flora of the Central <b>Ciscaucasia</b> are linked in their distribution of Caucasian floristic province (Euro-Caucasian, Caucasian and Sub-Caucasian). These same geographical elements to predominate in the head part of the spectrum families.
