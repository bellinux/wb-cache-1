40|$|We {{established}} {{a method to}} assay $^{ 210 }$Pb and $^{ 210 }$Po <b>contaminations</b> in the bulk of copper samples using a low-background alpha particle counter. The achieved sensitivity for the $^{ 210 }$Pb and $^{ 210 }$Po <b>contaminations</b> reaches a few mBq/kg. Due to this high sensitivity, the $^{ 210 }$Pb and $^{ 210 }$Po <b>contaminations</b> in oxygen free copper bulk were identified and measured for the first time. The $^{ 210 }$Pb <b>contaminations</b> of our oxygen free copper samples were 17 - 40 mBq/kg. Based on our investigation of copper samples in each production step, the $^{ 210 }$Pb in oxygen free copper was understood {{to be a small}} residual of an electrolysis process. This method to measure bulk <b>contaminations</b> of $^{ 210 }$Pb and $^{ 210 }$Po could be applied to other materials. Comment: 6 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
30|$|Background, aim, and scopeIn the {{district}} List of Hanover (Lower Saxony) radioactive <b>contaminations</b> {{of the ground}} were detected at a site of a former chemical plant. Due {{to the lack of}} an ordinance regarding intervention regulations in the case of radioactive <b>contaminations</b> in Germany this situation had to be assessed on the basis of scales and methods of the German regulations concerning soil protection and contaminated sites. In particular it was necessary to develop methods and levels for the assessment of radioactive <b>contaminations.</b>|$|R
5|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} {{are used}} as bioindicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of <b>contamination</b> with elements or compounds can indicate the state of <b>contamination</b> status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are sessile {{so that they are}} representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is used by some water treatment plants to test for estrogen-mimicking pollutants from industrial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces silica {{which has}} {{to be removed from}} the pig iron. The silica is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats {{to the surface of the}} molten pig iron.

Historically, to prevent <b>contamination</b> from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Contamination</b> {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow <b>contamination</b> by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater <b>contamination</b> can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly {{to the extent that it}} may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E

40|$|In {{numerous}} places, {{mining and}} ore treatment activities have generated environmental <b>contaminations</b> which endanger ecosystem viability and/or human health. In some places, the ecological pressure {{induced by the}} metal <b>contaminations</b> allowed the development a specific flora, fromwhich candidates for phytoremediation may be selected. A survey of edaphic conditions prevailing for plant growing in contaminated areas around metal smelters has been conducted in belgian calaminary sites (Zn, Pb, Cd <b>contaminations)</b> and in the Katanga province of RDC (Cu <b>contaminations).</b> As the processes generated by the modifications of the soil environment may affect {{the form of a}} trace element, that is its distribution through various pools, we investigated physical and chemical fractionation of some metallic trace elements (Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd) in soils and compared temperate and tropical cases. The results stress the need for a typology of the <b>contaminations</b> that takes into account the classical pedological parameters, even if contaminated sites are far from classical soil environment. The variability of edaphic properties that can occur within small distances is also an important point to consider when planning rehabilitation operations. Peer reviewe...|$|R
30|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the surface chemistry, including surface <b>contaminations,</b> of SnO 2 nanowires deposited on Ag-covered Si substrate by vapor phase deposition (VPD), thanks to x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) {{in combination with}} thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS). Air-exposed SnO 2 nanowires are slightly non-stoichiometric, and {{a huge amount of}} C <b>contaminations</b> is observed at their surface. After the thermal physical desorption (TPD) process, SnO 2 nanowires become almost stoichiometric without any surface C <b>contaminations.</b> This is probably related to the fact that C <b>contaminations,</b> as well as residual gases from air, are weakly bounded to the crystalline SnO 2 nanowires and can be easily removed from their surface. The obtained results gave us insight on the interpretation of the aging effect of SnO 2 nanowires that is of great importance for their potential application in the development of novel chemical nanosensor devices.|$|R

2500|$|Cleaning {{laboratory}} glassware is sometimes necessary {{and may be}} done using multiple methods.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} vacuum organic <b>contaminations</b> on laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of optical coatings. Anti-reflective (AR) coatings at 1064 nm made by Ta 2 O 5 /SiO 2 are deposited by the ion beam sputtering method. The LIDTs of AR coatings are measured in vacuum and in atmosphere, respectively. It is exhibited that <b>contaminations</b> in vacuum are easily to be absorbed onto optical surface because of lower pressure, and they become origins of damage, resulting in the decrease of LIDT from 24. 5 J/cm(2) in air to 15. 7 J/cm(2) in vacuum. The LIDT of coatings in vacuum has is slightly changed compared with the value in atmosphere after the organic <b>contaminations</b> are wiped off. These results indicate that organic <b>contaminations</b> are the main reason of the LIDT decrease in vacuum. Additionally, damage morphologies have distinct changes from vacuum to atmosphere because {{of the differences between}} the residual stress and thermal decomposability of filmy materials...|$|R

5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal <b>contamination</b> in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the <b>contamination</b> originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E

40|$|Monolayer ZrO 2 and {{multi-layer}} ZrO 2 /SiO 2 {{films were}} contaminated deliberately with toluene in vacuum environments.

Surface adsorption layer model was presented to evaluate the impact of organic <b>contaminations</b> on the laser-induced damage. Based on this model, the distributions of electric field and temperature field in multi-layer ZrO 2 /SiO 2 films were calculated. Results show that the mere organic <b>contaminations</b> cannot induce the thermal damage of optical films. The inter-coupling between defects and organic <b>contaminations</b> is probably attributed to the decrease of the laser-induced damage threshold in contaminated samples. (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
