5|$|Part I {{opens in}} 1972 Amsterdam. The narrator finds an old vellum-bound {{book with a}} woodcut of a dragon in the center {{associated}} with Dracula. When she asks her father Paul about it, he tells her how he found the handmade book in his study <b>carrel</b> {{when he was a}} graduate student in the 1950s. Paul took the book to his mentor, Professor Bartholomew Rossi, and was shocked to find that Rossi had found a similar handmade book when he was a graduate student in the 1930s. As a result, Rossi researched Țepeș, the Dracula myth surrounding him, and the mysterious book. Rossi traveled as far as Istanbul; however, the appearance of curious characters and unexplained events caused him to drop his investigation and return to his graduate work. Rossi gives Paul his research notes and informs him that he believes Dracula is still alive.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{visually}} impaired persons' (VIPs) {{sense of belonging}} in a university library context. It focuses on their perceptions of and experiences with study <b>carrels</b> located in the university library. Data were collected during interviews and focus group discussions. Participants consisted of five female and thirteen male students {{between the ages of}} 20 and 37 years. Participants considered their <b>carrels</b> as second homes where they felt safe, comfortable, and accepted. The <b>carrels</b> gave them a sense of belonging. The <b>carrels</b> also served as social places where the VIPs could interact with peers, volunteer readers, and other sighted students. The VIPs viewed their <b>carrels</b> as quiet havens where they could study and learn. They felt they belonged to the library community and were proud to be accepted as students at the university. The findings may increase library managements' awareness of the need to include these types of spaces in future design...|$|R

25|$|For {{much of his}} life, <b>Carrel</b> and {{his wife}} spent their summers on the Ile Saint-Gildas, which they owned.

25|$|In 1902, he was {{claimed to}} have {{witnessed}} the miraculous cure of Marie Bailly at Lourdes, made famous in part because she named <b>Carrel</b> as a witness of her cure. After the notoriety surrounding the event, <b>Carrel</b> could not obtain a hospital appointment because of the pervasive anticlericalism in the French university system at the time. In 1903 he emigrated to Montreal, Canada, but soon relocated to Chicago, Illinois to work for Hull Laboratory.

25|$|The ascent {{followed}} {{a long series}} of usually separate attempts by Edward Whymper and Jean-Antoine <b>Carrel</b> to reach the summit. Carrel's group had been 200 m below the summit on the Italian site when Croz and Whymper summited. The climbers from Valtournenche withdrew deflated, but three days later <b>Carrel</b> and Jean-Baptiste Bich reached the summit without incident.

25|$|In 1906 {{he joined}} the newly formed Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research in New York where he {{spent the rest of}} his career. There he did {{significant}} work on tissue cultures with pathologist Montrose Thomas Burrows. In the 1930s, <b>Carrel</b> and Charles Lindbergh became close friends {{not only because of the}} years they worked together but also because they shared personal, political, and social views. Lindbergh initially sought out <b>Carrel</b> to see if his sister-in-law's heart, damaged by rheumatic fever, could be repaired. When Lindbergh saw the crudeness of Carrel's machinery, he offered to build new equipment for the scientist. Eventually they built the first perfusion pump, an invention instrumental to the development of organ transplantation and open heart surgery. Lindbergh considered <b>Carrel</b> his closest friend, and said he would preserve and promote Carrel's ideals after his death.|$|E
25|$|Born in Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon, Rhône, <b>Carrel</b> {{was raised}} in a devout Catholic family and was educated by Jesuits, though he had become an {{agnostic}} by the time he became a university student.

Alexis <b>Carrel</b> was also a member of learned societies in the U.S., Spain, Russia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Vatican City, Germany, Italy and Greece and received honorary doctorates from Queen's University of Belfast, Princeton University, California, New York, Brown University and Columbia University.|$|E
50|$|Hayflick {{first became}} {{suspicious}} of <b>Carrel's</b> theory {{while working in}} a lab at the Wistar Institute. Hayflick was preparing normal human cells {{to be exposed to}} extracts of cancer cells when he noticed the normal cells had stopped proliferating. At first he thought that he had made a technical error in preparing the experiment, but later he began to think that the cell division processes had a counting mechanism. Working with Paul Moorhead, a cytogeneticist, he designed an experiment to test <b>Carrel's</b> theory of cell division.|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{that students will}} express no preference between <b>carrels</b> and open table type of accommodation in a language laboratory was tested in a four-week study. Two identical rooms, one containing <b>carrels</b> and the other containing open tables, were connected tc a single control room and lsed by 1, 080 university students (enrolled in language courses) who served as subjects. The students were observed in four week-long phases in which their behavior in selecting and using labcratory accommodation was observed; a verbal instrument designed to solicit factors in their selection of laboratory acccmmodation was administered; a questionnaire to determine each subject's normal choice of acccmmcdation; whether he attended sessions alone or with a friend, and the effects cf restricting him to cne or the other cf the rocms was completed by each student. Another observation procedure which identified subject choices by sex and a short questionnaire designed to identify preference; isolation, social, and interference variables were completed. Findings were that while students verbally preferred <b>carrels,</b> they actually used tables, that students at <b>carrels</b> were mcre easily disturbed, and that female students were more decisive in their choice of open tables {{and were more likely}} to attend with friends.
