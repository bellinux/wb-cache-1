25|$|The primary {{objective}} of a belt press filter is to dewater process sludge {{and much of}} this dewatering occurs in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone can achieve a 5 to 10 percent increase in solids concentration. The degree of dewatering in the gravity drainage zone is greatly dependent {{on the type of}} solids, the filter media and the sludge conditioning. The dewatering achieved in the gravity drainage zone is adversely affected if the sludge is poorly spread across the belt or the residence time is insufficient. Sludge conditioning is the addition of chemicals to promote flocculation of particles to form a thickened sludge and to promote dewatering. Dewatering can be promoted by the addition of surfactant and flocculation is achieved via the addition of high molecular weight polymer. Flocculation is improved with optimum polymer dosage, polymer dilution and mixing. The pH of the feed slurry must also be monitored and controlled as low pH decreases flocculation. It is important to find the optimum value for each conditioning parameter as too much polymer or mixing can {{have a negative impact on}} flocculation and greatly increase operating expenses. The effects of sludge conditioning are most apparent in the gravity drainage zone which can be easily replicated on a laboratory scale where the optimum conditioning strategy can be determined. For a belt press filter to be industrially viable it must be economically efficient and thus maximum throughput is desired. Without sufficient conditioning, the gravity drainage is generally the limiting process step, but with optimum dilution the limiting process step can be shifted to the <b>compression</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} three dimensional (3 D) and {{two dimensional}} (2 D) axisymmetric finite element analyses of {{a corner of}} a tailings dam. The analyses were performed to: (i) locate tension and/or low <b>compression</b> <b>zones</b> and to evaluate slope stability during sequential raising of the dam corner, and (ii) find whether the results of 2 D axisymmetric analyses can be reliable for the dam corner. The corner is a potentially weak section of the dam where tension and/or low <b>compression</b> <b>zones</b> may develop. Development of such zones inside the dam corner can lead to cracks and initiation of internal erosion. The results of both the 3 D and 2 D axisymmetric analyses indicated that (i) tension and/or low <b>compression</b> <b>zones</b> were located in vicinity of surface of the dam corner mainly above the phreatic level, and (ii) the dam corner is stable up to the planned height if it is gradually strengthened with rockfill berms on the downstream side. The results of 2 D axisymmetric analyses showed a fairly good agreement with those of 3 D analyses. It is concluded that 2 D axisymmetric analyses are appropriate for this dam corner. This implies that significant computational time can be saved by utilizing 2 D analyses instead of 3 D analyses. Validerad; 2017;Nivå 2; 2017 - 10 - 31 (rokbeg) </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for flexural modulus of laminated composites derived from the analysis of a flexural-section composed of several ductile and brittle layers of different moduli. The derivation {{is based on the}} assumption that the tension and <b>compression</b> <b>zones</b> of the laminated composite are symmetrical with respect to the neutral axis and thus, half of the section is needed to analyze for complete derivation of flexural modulus of the whole section. This composed of two ductile layers of higher moduli providing in both tension and <b>compression</b> <b>zones</b> to maintain the equilibrium conditions during flexure. The formulation shows that the flexural modulus of the entire section of laminated composites obtained by this method is equal to the modulus of ductile layers plus a factor of the difference of modulus of ductile and brittle layers. It is concluded that this factor is different from the usual one which is obtained under uniaxial loadings. Despite the fragile nature of brittle layers of the composite, it has been found that the inclusion of two ductile layers into the laminated cementitious composites makes it fully ductile material owing to the synergetic action between the layers of two components...|$|R
