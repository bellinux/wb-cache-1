40|$|In {{case you}} haven 2 ̆ 7 t heard, Pluto isn 2 ̆ 7 t a planet anymore (and maybe it never was). In grade school, we all memorized the planets, giving little thought to what made {{something}} a planet besides revolving around the Sun and {{being part of}} some familiar mnemonic. However, scientific discoveries about Pluto {{and other parts of}} space led scientists to question Pluto 2 ̆ 7 s planetary status and ultimately, to strip Pluto of its standing among the planets. This leads to the inevitable question-what is a planet?-which {{turns out to be a}} more difficult and fascinating question than one might think. The Pluto Files grapples with the question of what it is to be a planet. The book is as much a cultural study as an astrophysical one. 2 ̆ 2 Gathered here in one place is a record of Pluto 2 ̆ 7 s rise and fall from planethood, given by way of media accounts, public <b>forums,</b> <b>cartoons,</b> and letters I received from disgruntled schoolchildren, their teachers, strongly opinionated adults, and colleagues 2 ̆ 2 (p. xi). The Pluto Files thus presents the question of the meaning of planet not through rigorous argumentation but through the crosswinds of culture and science...|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{critical}} reviews of Friendship Is Magic, published shortly after the initial broadcast in October 2010, was written by Amid Amidi for the animation website Cartoon Brew. Amidi wrote that the show {{was a sign of}} [...] "the end of the creator-driven era in TV animation". Amidi's essay expressed concern that assigning a talent like Faust to a toy-centric show was part of a trend towards a focus on profitable genres of animation, such as toy tie-ins, to deal with a fragmented viewing audience, and overall [...] "an admission of defeat for the entire movement, a white flag-waving moment for the TV animation industry." [...] The article said this concern was over the fact that more and more shows seem to be driven by company executives who want to sell their products, rather than creators. Though the show had been discussed on 4chan's <b>cartoon</b> <b>forum</b> before the essay's publication, the alarmist nature of the essay led to more interest in the show, resulting in a positive response for the series for its plot, characters, and animation style. This reaction soon spread to the other boards of 4chan, where elements of the show quickly inspired recurring jokes and memes on the site. Some of these included adopting phrases from the show like [...] "anypony", [...] "everypony", and [...] "nopony", instead of [...] "anybody", [...] "everybody", and [...] "nobody", or jokingly stating that they watch the show for the [...] "plot", a reference to the ponies' flanks.|$|E
