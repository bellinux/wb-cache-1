The occupations which he followed encroached, in their opinion, upon the article of Ellangowan's gentry, and he found it necessary gradually to estrange himself from their society, and sink into what was then a very ambiguous character, a gentleman farmer. In the midst of his schemes death claimed his tribute, and the scanty remains of a large property descended upon Godfrey Bertram, the present possessor, his only son.|$|E

I propose a series of factors - variables that influence the different stages of negotiation, and analyse their importance into the context. The research conclusions reveal the fact that some correlations can be outlined between the different aspects of the negotiation process and the promotional communications of the two parties involved. Also, a very interesting path for further research is represented by the effect that the correlation between internal and external marketing communication can have upon the activity of the two partners in the negotiations process...|$|R

Content which has been authored and produced for general broadcast can take on additional commercial service features when personalised either for individual viewers or for groups of viewers participating in entertainment, training, gaming or informational activities.

Targeted advertising and product placement are currently garnering intense interest in the commercial networked media industries. Personalisation of product placement is a relevant and timely service for next generation online marketing and advertising and for many other revenue generating interactive services. This paper discusses the acquisition and insertion of media objects into a TV video play-out stream where the objects are determined by the profile of the viewer. The technology is based on MPEG- 4 standards using object based video and MPEG- 7 for metadata. No proprietary technology or protocol is proposed. To trade the objects into the video play-out, a Software-as-a-Service brokerage platform based on intelligent agent technology is adopted. Agencies, libraries and service providers are represented in a <b>commercial</b> <b>negotiation</b> to facilitate the contractual selection and usage of objects to be inserted into the video play-out...|$|R

Some of the more extensively modified Ultras described in the books have, apparently intentionally, turned themselves into living sculptures.

The sub-prime market represents a much needed expansion of credit markets {{to those who have}} been denied access to credit though they are creditworthy. The high failure rate of the sub-prime market indicates that market forces are ineffective in halting this economic abuse. This article argues that the public policy choices and justifications for certain practices have marginalized the concerns of particular consumer classes. It challenges the premise that the free market can and should operate without interference and critiques it from the a utilitarian perspective using home-equity lending as an example. It endorses the need for diversified financial services industry but argues that predatory lending, which is the result of market information failure, does not fulfill this objective and in fact leads to an onerous type of borrower market segmentation. The capital supply of predatory lenders is critical to eliminating the sharp practices presently sanctioned by law. Proposing a duty on the originating lender to conduct a due diligence analysis, the article suggests that closer adherence to the rules of <b>commercial</b> <b>negotiation</b> would place more scrutiny on both the funding of predatory lenders by the primary market and the selling of predatory loans on the secondary market...|$|R
