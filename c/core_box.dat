50|$|The part to be {{made and}} its pattern must be {{designed}} to accommodate each stage of the process, as it must be possible to remove the pattern without disturbing the molding sand and to have proper locations to receive and position the cores. A slight taper, known as draft, must be used on surfaces perpendicular to the parting line, {{in order to be}} able to remove the pattern from the mold. This requirement also applies to cores, as they must be removed from the <b>core</b> <b>box</b> in which they are formed. The sprue and risers must be arranged to allow a proper flow of metal and gasses within the mold in order to avoid an incomplete casting. Should a piece of core or mold become dislodged it may be embedded in the final casting, forming a sand pit, which may render the casting unusable. Gas pockets can cause internal voids. These may be immediately visible or may only be revealed after extensive machining has been performed.

Here we show that the U 8 snoRNP is also restructured, suggesting that this may occur with all box C/D snoRNPs. We have characterized four novel human biogenesis factors (BCD 1, NOP 17, NUFIP, and TAF 9) which, along with the ATPases TIP 48 and TIP 49, {{are likely to be}} involved in the formation of the pre-snoRNP.
