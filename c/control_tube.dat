40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the electrical properties of a commonly used stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> for medium voltage heat-shrink joints using non-destructive methods in laboratory. The electrical {{properties of the}} tube were determined by use of dielectric spectroscopy while changing the temperature, AC electric field and humidity level. In order to characterize the material, both differential scanning calorimetry and water uptake measurements was performed on samples of stress <b>control</b> <b>tube.</b> Two similar test objects were used {{in order to obtain}} a higher electric field strength at the same applied AC voltage. A Raychem stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> was shrunk on the outside of a cylindrical shape consisting of two metal electrodes and a PTFE rod separating them. The length of the PTFE rod was 100 mm for Object L, while only 20 mm for Object S providing a higher field strength. Water uptake measurement was performed {{in order to determine the}} stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> s ability to diffuse water. Measurement results imply that the water uptake is dependent of both the degree of shrinkage and the temperature. The highest water content is observed for a virgin stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> kept at 90 ℃, with a concentration of 8 % after 105 days. None on the test samples reached saturation during the experimental work. Differential scanning calorimetry measurement was performed in order to examine if the stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> had any phase transitions changing the electrical properties of the stress <b>control</b> <b>tube.</b> Samples of stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> were examined in the temperature range of 20 ℃ to 200 ℃. Results indicate that the stress <b>control</b> <b>tube,</b> independent of the degree of shrinkage, has an endothermic melting transition in the temperature range of 94 ℃ to 114 ℃. Dielectric response measurements show that the thermal transition of the stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> will provide an increased conductivity. This is likely caused by a change from semi-crystalline to amorphous state, releasing trapped charge carriers and providing the material to become more electrical conductive. Dielectric spectroscopy was performed on both test objects in the electric field range from 0. 025 1. 0 kVpeak/mm for Object S and 0. 005 0. 01 kVpeak/mm for Object L. Frequency was varied from 100 Hz to 1 mHz. A temperature dependence was observed for dielectric loss tangent, in addition to large values up to 1000. At higher temperatures, the dielectric loss tangent was observed independent of the electric field. For measurements at 40 ℃, an electric field dependence is observed for field strengths above 0. 5 kVpeak/mm. The results show that the conductivity is dependent of the temperature. After exposed to 150 ℃, the temperature is decreased to 40 ℃ and a new measurement is performed. Hysteresis effect is then observed as the conductivity attains a higher value than before exposed to high temperatures. The conductivity is found independent at the electrical field at high temperatures. At low temperatures, the electrical field dependence is observed for field strengths above 0. 5 kVpeak/mm. Observations made imply that the conductivity is strongly dependent of the humidity level. When performing dielectric response measurement on a wet test object, the conductivity experienced a significant increase from 10 - 11 to 10 - 5 S/m. Wet stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> was dissected after complete dielectric response measurement.

40|$|The {{electrical}} properties of a widely used stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> for medium voltage heat-shrink joints are {{examined in this}} master thesis by using non-destructive laboratory methods. They were determined by use of time domain dielectric response test while changing the DC electric field, temperature and level of humidity. In {{order to determine the}} physical and mechanical characteristics of the material at different aging stages and conditions, both differential scanning calorimetry and tensile test measurements were performed on stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> samples. Two types of test samples were prepared. For dielectric response tests, Raychem JSCR 42 / 16 stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> was shrunk on a cylindrical rod, consisting of two metal electrodes, separated by a PTFE (Teflon) insulating rod. For differential scanning calorimetry and tensile tests, the stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> was shrunk on a cylindrical PTFE rod only, with the same diameter as for the dielectric response tests without the presence of metal electrodes. Tensile test measurements were performed in order to characterize and compare the mechanical properties of the stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> material at different aging stages. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were used to estimate aging degree by assessment of thermal resistivity of the material and antioxidants consumption when exposed to high temperatures for a certain period of time. To calculate the conductivity, dielectric response measurements were performed in time domain at different voltage levels up to 20 kV and charging and discharging time duration of 10800 s. They were conducted by placing the test object in a climate chamber in order to examine the influence of temperature and humidity. The measurements were performed on unaged and thermally aged heat shrinkable stress control tubes. The aging process was obtained in heat cabinets at 98 °C dry air, 98 °C wet air and 150 °C dry air conditions. Results from the analysis show that conductivity has not significant dependency of the electric field up to 0. 2 kV/mm at different temperatures, aging degree and humidity. It was revealed that conductivity is more temperature dependent, as a significant increase was observed when the temperature was elevated at higher values. Conductivity was found out to be strongly dependent on humidity, especially when combined with high aging degree. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Optimization {{of water}} use in {{agriculture}} and quantification of percolation from landfills and watersheds require reliable estimates of vadose-zone water fluxes. Current technology is limited primarily to lysimeters, which directly measure water flux but are expensive and may {{in some way}} disrupt flow, causing errors in the measured drainage. We report on design considerations and field tests of an alternative approach, passive-wick fluxmeters, which use a <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> to minimize convergent or divergent flow. Design calculations with a quasi-three-dimensional model illustrate how convergence and divergence can be minimized {{for a range of}} soil and climatic conditions under steady-state and transient fluxes using control tubes of varying heights.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{tubercle}} bacilli soon develop resistance to drugs used in the treatment of tuberculosis, that the information regarding resistance is useful in the treatment, and that regular determination of resistance should be included in all compaigns against tuberculosis. Since 1957 resistance determi-nations have been carried on, on a small scale in the Department of Pathology and Bacterio-logy, King George’s Medical College, Lucknow and the results obtained during the last 6 years have been analysed in this note. Determinations of resistance can be per-formed as a direct test with inoculations of the homogenised material or as an indirect test after isolation of the strain. Direct test is better for it saves work, gives results in about 3 weeks, affords a reliable estimate of the percentage of resistant tubercle bacilli in the given specimen. Indirect tests were put up only when the growth in the <b>control</b> <b>tubes</b> without drugs showed less than 50 colonies. As the aim of these tests is to compare the resistance of tubercle bacilli isolated from the patients with that of a standard strain it is necessary to know the dose of the drug at which standard strain ceases to grow. In this connection Dr Jensen’s (1954) suggestion regarding the strength of the drugs to be incorporated in the mediums were adopted and the standard strains used were either E 5 or H 37 Rv.

Consistently lower concentrations of MS 2 {{were found in the}} liquid phase in the absence of soil (control blanks) than in the presence of soil after mixing. High levels of MS 2 inactivation (; 99. 9 %) were observed in <b>control</b> <b>tubes</b> made of polypropylene (PP), with comparatively little loss of virus seen in PP tubes when soil was present. Minimal inactivation of MS 2 was observed when the air-water interface was completely eliminated from PP control blanks during mixing. All batch experiments performed with reactor tubes made of glass demonstrated no substantial inactivation of MS 2. In similar experiments, bacteriophage fX 174 did not undergo inactivation in either PP or glass control blanks, implying that this virus is not affected by the same factors which led to inactivation of MS 2 in the PP <b>control</b> <b>tubes.</b> When possible, phage adsorption to soil was calculated by the Freundlich isotherm. Our data suggest that forces associated with the air-water-solid interface (where the solid is a hydrophobic surface) are responsible for inactivation of MS 2 in the PP <b>control</b> <b>tubes.</b> The influence of air-water interfacial forces should be carefully considered when batch sorption experiments are conducted with certain viruses. Application of wastewater effluents to land for treatment purposes must take into consideration the potential for groundwater pollution due to virus transport through the sub-surface. A number of studies have clearly documented the ability of viruses to migrate significant distances through soil, resulting in groundwater contamination (16, 21, 41).

40|$|A {{new model}} for the {{evaluation}} of the electric field in a cable termination realized through a nonlinear stress <b>control</b> <b>tube</b> (SCT), is presented in this paper.

It is shown that even the well-known RC transmission line model can be derived from this general approach. The underlying approximations leading to the circuital model are discussed in detail. The proposed model, in contrast with the circuital one, allows us to take into account properly the nonlinear SCT characteristics and the actual boundary conditions: in this way both spatial and temporal effects of the nonlinearity are considered.
