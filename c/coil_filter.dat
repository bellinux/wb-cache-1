40|$|Previous reports {{found that}} some fluoride-containing dentifrices do not release {{effective}} concentrations of fluoride during brushing. Failure to release fluoride can be due to dentifrice matrix components that interfere with the solubilization of the fluoride salts during brushing. A new generation of dentifrices has the capability to precipitate beneficial fluoride salts during tooth brushing. Therefore, a method that assesses the potentially available fluoride during the 1 -minute brushing is needed. A new filter-paper absorption method to assess the 1 -min bioavailable fluoride concentration {{was developed to meet}} this need. This method utilizes <b>coiled</b> <b>filter</b> paper that rapidly absorbs the aqueous phase of the dentifrice slurry followed by centrifugation to recover that fluid for fluoride measurement via fluoride ion-selective electrode. The analytical method was used to successfully determine the total fluoride and 1 -min bioavailable fluoride in eight dentifrice products containing sodium fluoride (NaF), disodium monofluorophosphate (Na 2 FPO 3, MFP), stannous fluoride (SnF 2), or NaF with amorphous calcium phosphate (NaF + ACP). The results showed that some of the dentifrices tested had significantly lower potentially available fluoride than the total fluoride. For a MFP-containing sample, aged seven years past its expiry date, there was significant reduction in the bioavailable fluoride compared to MFP products that were not aged.

A stack of twodimensional images is acquired by moving an internal surface coil along the structure of interest and using the images {{as the basis for}} creating the three-dimensional image [...] Spatial information about the individual two-dimensional images is required in order to t' correctly build the three-dimensional image: Specialised tracking coils for the colonoscope have been constructed to provide the location and orientation needed for each image acquired from an imaging coil that can be mounted on the colonoscope. The tracking coils are used for both acquiring positional information and for defining the location for scanning. Hence, as the colonoscope moves in the' body, the scan plane will change accordingly. Images and tracking data were collected from experiments using an MRI scanner, cylindrical phantoms to mimic the colorectum, and a colonoscope coil mounted on a mock colonoscope that also housed the tracking coils. Image processing techniques were used to filter each image and to correct for the falloff of the signal as the distance increased from the imaging <b>coil.</b> Bilateral <b>filtering</b> was based on noise estimates determined in each image.

The unwrapped phase images of each <b>coil</b> are <b>filtered</b> using local random field based probabilistic weights, derived using energy functions representative of noisy sensitivity and tissue information pertaining to venous {{structure in the}} individual channel phase images. The channel energy functions are obtained as functions of local image intensities, first or second order clique phase difference and a threshold scaling parameter dependent on the input noise level. Whereas the expectation of the individual energy functions {{with respect to the}} noise distribution in clique phase differences is to be maximized for optimal filtering, the expectation of tissue energy function decreases and noise energy function increases with increase in threshold scale parameter. The optimum scaling parameter is shown to occur at the point where expectations of both energy functions contribute to the largest possible extent. It is shown that implementation of the filter in the same lines as that of Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) algorithm provides structural enhancement in the coil combined phase, with reduced noise amplification. Application to simulated and in vivo multi-channel SWI shows that CNR of combined phase obtained using MAP-MRF filter is higher as compared to that of coil combination using weighted average.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{integral}} motor of tomorrow, and particularly with a variable speed, sensorless permanent magnet synchronous motor with an integrated converter. The rated power is 15 kW at 1500 r/min. The outer dimensions are approximately {{the same as for}} the equivalent standard induction motor. Control strategies for pumps and fans, i. e. suitable loads for variable speed motors, are briefly described. The huge energy savings that can be made by reducing the speed instead of throttling/choking the flow are pointed out. Compared to installing an induction motor with a separate converter, a PM integral motor will probably pay-off in less than a year. A totally analytical expression for calculating the airgap flux density of permanent magnet motors with buried magnets is derived. The analytical expression includes axial leakage, and iron saturation of the most narrow part of the magnetic circuit of the machine. A computer program for optimization of PM motors with buried magnets has been developed. It was used to design the manufactured prototype PM integral motor, and the parameters are investigated with analytical and/or FEM calculations. The optimization program is also used to suggest nearoptimum pole numbers for desired powers (4 - 37 kW) and speeds (750 - 3000 r/min) of inverter-fed PM motors.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} ocular fluid filtration and endplate positioning in glaucomatous {{eyes with}} long-tube glaucoma drainage devices (GDDs) using {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) {{and the effects of}} various factors on postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP). This observational case series included 27 consecutive glaucomatous eyes (18 men, 7 women; mean age ± standard error, 63. 0 ± 2. 0 years) who underwent GDD implantation (n = 8 Ahmed Glaucoma Valves [AGV] and n = 19 Baerveldt Glaucoma Implants [BGI]). Tubes were inserted into the pars plana in 23 eyes and anterior chamber in 4 eyes. Six months postoperatively, high-resolution orbital images were obtained using 3 -Tesla MRI with head-array <b>coils,</b> and the <b>filtering</b> bleb volume, bleb height, and distances between the anterior endplate edge and corneal center or limbus or between the endplate and orbital wall were measured. In MR images obtained by three-dimensional fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (3 D-FIESTA) sequences, the shunt endplate was identified as low-intensity signal, and the filtering bleb was identified as high-intensity signals above and below the endplate in all eyes. The 6 -month-postoperative IOP level was correlated negatively with bleb volume (r = - 0. 4510, P = 0. 0182) and bleb height (r = - 0. 3954, P = 0. 0412). The postoperative IOP was significantly (P = 0. 0026) lower in BGI-implanted eyes (12. 2 ± 0. 7 mmHg) than AGV-implanted eyes (16. 7 ± 1. 2 mmHg); bleb volume was significantly (P = 0. 0093) larger in BGI-implanted eyes (478. 8 ± 84. 2 mm 3) than AGV-implanted eyes (161. 1 ± 52. 3 mm 3).

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to {{investigate}} the role of filtration in maintaining clean heat exchanger coils and overall performance. Combinations of 6 different levels of filtration (MERV 14, 11, 8, 6, 4, and no filter) and 4 different coils (an eight-row lanced-fin coil, HX 8 L), (an eight-row wavy-fin coil, HX 8 W), (a four-row lanced-fin coil, HX 4 L) and (a two-row lanced-fin coil, HX 2 L) were tested at 4 different air velocities (1. 52, 2. 03, 2. 54, 3. 05 m/s (300, 400, 500, 600 ft/min)). The fouled conditions were obtained after injection of 600 grams of ASHRAE standard dust upstream of the filter/coil combination. This magnitude of dust is representative of a year of normal operation for an air conditioning system. The air-side pressure drops of the <b>coils</b> and <b>filters</b> and air-side heat transfer coefficients of the coils were determined from the measurements under the clean and fouled conditions. Depending upon the <b>filter</b> and <b>coil</b> test, the coil pressure drops increased in the range of 6 %- 30 % for an air velocity at 2. 54 m/s (500 ft/min). The impact was significantly greater for tests performed without a filter. The largest relative effect of fouling on pressure drop occurs for coils with fewer rows and having lanced fins. Coils with a greater number of rows can hold more dust so that a fixed amount of dust has a relatively smaller impact. The impact of fouling on air-side heat transfer coefficients was found to be relatively small. In some cases, heat transfer was actually enhanced due to additional turbulence caused by the presence of dust. The experimental results for pressure drops and heat transfer coefficients were correlated and the correlations were implemented within computer models of prototypical rooftop air conditioners and used to evaluate the impact of fouling on cooling capacity and EER. The equipment cooling capacity is reduced with fouling primarily because of a decrease in air flow due to the increase pressure drop rather than due to changes in h eat transfer coefficient. In most cases, the EER was reduced with fouling primarily due to increased fan power. However, the changes in EER were relatively small, in the range of 1 %- 9 % (10 %). For most cases, equipment having low efficiency filters had higher EER after fouling than equipment with high efficiency filters, because the high efficiency filter caused significantly higher pressure drops than the low efficiency filters. The extra filter pressure drop outweighed the reduced coil pressure drop after fouling. The impact of fan efficiency curves was also investigated in the study. The energy penalty associated with high efficiency filters was reduced considerably with higher efficiency fans. There is an energy penalty associated with the use of high efficiency filtration. However, the primary reason for selecting high efficiency filters for a particular application would be improved air quality. For HX 8 L, the quantity of dust passing through the coil with a MERV 4 filter was approximately 30 times the dust passing the coil with a MERV 14 filter. Without an upstream filter, the quantity of dust passing through the coil was approximately 60 times the value for a MERV 14 filter...|$|R
