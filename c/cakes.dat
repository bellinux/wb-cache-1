She gets a free cake with the card {{but it has}} a mistake in the decoration so NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) returns it to the restaurant.

40|$|Coupons of rigid ceramic {{filtration}} media have been conditioned using fine gasifier char and calcium carbonate dusts {{and both the}} <b>cake</b> resistance and the stress needed to detach the <b>cake</b> from the medium have been measured. For gasifier char, <b>cake</b> resistance appears to be independent of face velocity and proportional to areas <b>cake</b> loading, while <b>cake</b> removal stress is approximately independent of loading. For calcium carbonate, broadening the size distribution increases the <b>cake</b> resistance but slightly reduces the <b>cake</b> removal stress. Increases in particle size and <b>cake</b> void fraction decrease both <b>cake</b> resistance and <b>cake</b> removal stress. However, since increase in particle size seems often {{to be accompanied by}} decrease in <b>cake</b> void fraction, the range of commonly-observed <b>cake</b> resistivities and removal stresses is narrower than might otherwise be expected. © 1992...|$|R
