2500|$|The torban (торбан, also teorban or Ukrainian theorbo) is a Ukrainian musical {{instrument}} that combines {{the features of}} the Baroque Lute with those of the psaltery. The Тorban differs from the more <b>common</b> <b>European</b> <b>Bass</b> lute known as the Theorbo in that it had additional short treble strings (known as prystrunky) strung along the treble side of the soundboard. It appeared ca. 1700, probably influenced by the central European Theorbo and the Angelique which Cossack mercenaries would have encountered in the Thirty Years' War, although the likelier possibility is that certain Tuliglowski, a paulite monk, was its inventor. The Torban was manufactured and used mainly in Ukraine, but also occasionally encountered in neighbouring Poland and Russia (only 3 luthiers could be identified from the surviving instruments). There are about 40 torbans in museums around the world, with the largest group of 14 instruments in St. Petersburg. The term [...] "torban" [...] was often misapplied in the vernacular in western Ukraine to any instrument of the Baroque Lute type until the early 20th century.|$|E

50|$|As Europe merged politically, a <b>common</b> <b>European</b> {{tort law}} also emerged. In {{the middle of}} the 20th Century, European tort law was varied and a <b>common</b> <b>European</b> tort law was non-existent. Only in the {{beginning}} of the 21st did it started to take shape.|$|R
50|$|There are two genetically {{distinct}} {{populations of}} wild <b>European</b> <b>bass.</b> The first {{is found in}} the northeast Atlantic Ocean and the second {{is found in the}} western Mediterranean Sea. The two populations are separated by a relatively narrow distance in a region known as the Almeria-Oran oceanographic front, located east of the Spanish city of Almería. The exact reason for this separation is unknown, as the geographic divide itself should not account for a lack of gene flow between the two populations. The larval stage of the <b>European</b> <b>bass</b> can last up to 3 months, during which it is unable to swim well, and even a small amount of water flow should transport some individuals between the two regions. In addition, juveniles are able to survive temperature and salinity changes and adults are capable of migrating hundreds of miles.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>European</b> <b>bass</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1758 by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus {{in his work}} Systema Naturae. He named it Perca labrax. In the {{century and a half}} following, it was classified under a variety of new synonyms, with Dicentrarchus labrax winning out as the accepted name in 1987. Its generic name, Dicentrarchus, derives Greek from the presence of two anal spines, [...] "di" [...] meaning two, [...] "kentron" [...] meaning sting, and [...] "archos" [...] meaning anus. The <b>European</b> <b>bass</b> is sold under dozens of common names in various languages. In the British Isles it is known as the [...] "European bass," [...] "European seabass," [...] "common bass," [...] "capemouth," [...] "king of the mullets," [...] "sea bass," [...] "sea dace," [...] "sea perch," [...] "white mullet," [...] "white salmon," [...] or simply [...] "bass." ...|$|R

50|$|Annual {{catches of}} wild <b>European</b> <b>bass</b> are {{relatively}} modest, having fluctuated between 8,500 and 11,900 tonnes in 2000-2009.

In the Mediterranean, Italy used to report the largest catches, but has been surpassed by Egypt in recent years.|$|R

Most readily identified are American harp guitars with either hollow arms, double necks or harp-like frames for supporting extra <b>bass</b> strings, and <b>European</b> <b>bass</b> guitars (or contraguitars).

5000|$|The <b>European</b> <b>bass</b> (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a {{primarily}} ocean-going fish {{native to}} the waters off of Europe's western and southern and Africa's northern coasts, though {{it can also be}} found in shallow coastal waters and river mouths during the summer months. It is one of only six species in its family, Moronidae, collectively called the temperate basses. It is both fished and raised commercially, and is considered {{to be the most important}} fish currently cultured in the Mediterranean. It is marketed under a variety of names, including [...] "sea dace," [...] "seabass," [...] and [...] "Mediterranean seabass," [...] among others. <b>European</b> <b>bass</b> can reach sizes of up to 1 m in length and 12 kg in weight, though the most common size is only about half of that at 0.5 m. Individuals are silvery grey in color and sometimes a dark-bluish color on the back.|$|R
