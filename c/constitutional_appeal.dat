25|$|The recent {{increase}} in support for Catalan independence {{has its roots}} in a Constitutional Court ruling in 2010, which struck down parts of the regional 2006 Statute of Autonomy that granted new powers of self-rule to the region. The ruling came after four years of deliberation concerning a <b>constitutional</b> <b>appeal</b> filed by the conservative People's Party (PP) under Mariano Rajoy—then the country's second-largest party, in opposition to the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party—and was met with anger and street protests in Catalonia. Shortly afterward the PP took power in Spain, and after a massive independence demonstration took place in Barcelona on 11 September 2012—Catalonia's National Day—the Catalan government under Artur Mas called a snap regional election and set out to initiate Catalonia's process towards independence.|$|E

50|$|Uganda v. Commissioner of Prisons, Ex Parte Matovu, {{commenced}} and sowed {{the seeds}} for {{the advent of the}} Political question Doctrine in Uganda. It has subsequently been applied in landmark decisions such as Attorney General v.

50|$|Habeas corpus {{still remains}} {{a problem for}} the convicts who need to {{participate}} in the hearings on civil jurisdiction. Addressing this issue, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine passed a ruling on 12.04.2012 in the case on <b>constitutional</b> <b>appeal</b> of the citizen A.Troyan concerning official interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of Ukraine. (The case re: equality of parties to the trial). Mr.Troyan approached the CCU seeking official interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of Ukraine concerning the right of an incarcerated convict to be brought to court to participate in the hearing of civil jurisdiction (the equal rights of parties to the lawsuit). The Court responded that “personal participation of a convict serving his/her sentence in a penitentiary institution, as a party to the trial, meets the requirement of complete, comprehensive, objective and un-biased hearing. This participation of a convict, as a party to the cases heard in the courts of all jurisdictions, specializations and instances should be ensured by the respective procedural law. Decision on a convict’s participation as a party to the trial should be made by a court in the order and under conditions determined by the respective procedural law.” Hence the convict has “the equal right to protection of his rights and freedoms in court and to participation in the hearing of his case in the order defined by the respective procedural law in the courts of all jurisdictions, specializations and instances”. So, on the one hand the Court ruled that the convict has the right to participate in the hearing on his case, but only in accordance with the order established by the respective procedural law. But the very core of the problem {{lies in the fact that}} neither civil procedural, nor administrative procedural law properly regulates this matter. That is why the CCU Decision, instead of improving the situation, provided formal grounds for depriving the convicts of their right to participate in the hearings on their cases until the respective procedural law is passed.|$|E

Subsequent external communication to decision makers and media increased the awareness of the positive impact of the ban and helped adress its' key critical challenge areas...|$|E
30|$|Germany {{was not an}} {{exception}} to this trend. After the Maastricht Treaty was signed, Euroscepticism spread among economists who were firmly rooted in liberal ideologies. Some used their specialty to criticize the plan for a European monetary community and expressed their skepticism about hasty European integration. For example, the anti-Maastricht Treaty declaration, which was signed {{by a total of}} 62 economics professors including Ohr and Schäfer (1992) in June 1992, listed the risks associated with the plan, such as an economic gap among member countries, the structural defects of monetary community, and the possible tarnishing of the economy by political agenda, and warned that the introduction of a single currency could trigger conflicts in Europe rather than encourage integration. A declaration of a similar nature was also announced in 1998, just before the introduction of the Euro. A total of 160 economics professors expressed their concerns about the flaws and hastiness of Euro introduction through a declaration (Kösters et al. 1998). The opposition movement against Maastricht Treaty also birthed new political parties. The Federation of Free Citizens (Bund für Bürger, BfB), formed in 1994 and inspired by the Liberal Party of Austria, is an example of such. The party was founded on pillars that consist of economic liberalism, heavy criticism of EU economic policy, and opposition to Eurocentrism, which would operate according to political consensus rather than the logic of the market and competition. Joachim Starbatty, former deputy leader of the BfB, was a representative of opposition to the Euro system whose criticism was backed by Ordoliberalism. Franz-Ulrich Willeke, an economics professor at the University of Heidelberg, was also a deputy leader of the BfB, and others such as Roland Vaubel and Willhelm Hankel, both economics professors, did not join the party but openly endorsed it. Karl Albrecht Schachtschneider, a jurist and {{a founding member of the}} BfB, was also a well-known anti-Europeanist. He, along with Starbatty, Hankel, and others, filed a <b>constitutional</b> <b>appeal</b> against The Amsterdam Treaty, which can be regarded as a follow-up measure to the Maastricht Treaty. BfB members and supporters, who stood at the forefront of opposition against the Euro system, would eventually become the key members of the AfD.|$|E
