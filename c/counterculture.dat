5|$|On {{the left-wing}} and <b>counterculture</b> side, the film {{included}} references to topical political matters like Kent State shootings, President Harry S. Truman's decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Richard Nixon, the Vietnam war, {{and the civil}} rights movement. Precursors of this <b>counterculture</b> subversive humor in film were two non-"college movies", M*A*S*H, a 1970 satirical dark comedy, and The Kentucky Fried Movie, a 1977 formless comedy consisting of a series of sketches (which was also directed by Landis).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This thesis will {{challenge}} the traditional marketing perspective {{by adding a}} post-modern approach to marketing. Secondary {{an analysis of the}} post-modern consumer as well as the importance of neo tribalism in marketing will be described. Additionally the necessity of including countercultural segments and the importance of <b>countercultures</b> will be argued. Finally this thesis will examine which marketing method is the most useful when working with <b>countercultures...</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>counterculture</b> of the 1960s had rapidly {{declined}} by {{the start of}} the 1970s, in large part due to the collapse of the commune movement, but it would be many former members of the counter-culture and hippie subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the New Age movement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, rock spawned several subgenres, {{beginning}} with surf. Surf was an instrumental guitar genre {{characterized by a}} distorted sound, associated with the Southern California surfing youth culture. Inspired by the lyrical focus of surf, The Beach Boys began recording in 1961 with an elaborate, pop-friendly, and harmonic sound. As their fame grew, The Beach Boys' songwriter Brian Wilson experimented with new studio techniques and became associated with the <b>counterculture.</b> The <b>counterculture</b> was a movement that embraced political activism, and was closely connected to the hippie subculture. The hippies were associated with folk rock, country rock, and psychedelic rock. Folk and country rock {{were associated with the}} rise of politicized folk music, led by Pete Seeger and others, especially at the Greenwich Village music scene in New York. Folk rock entered the mainstream {{in the middle of the}} 1960s, when the singer-songwriter Bob Dylan began his career. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes The Beatles' shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-1960s to Bob Dylan's influence at the time. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands and soft, folky singer-songwriters. Psychedelic rock was a hard-driving kind of guitar-based rock, closely associated with the city of San Francisco. Though Jefferson Airplane was the only local band to have a major national hit, the Grateful Dead, a country and bluegrass-flavored jam band, became an iconic part of the psychedelic <b>counterculture,</b> associated with hippies, LSD and other symbols of that era. Some say that the Grateful Dead were truly the most American patriotic rock band to have ever existed; forming and molding a culture that defines Americans today.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{revealed}} a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. Controversial through his political and peace activism, {{he moved from}} London to Manhattan in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. Some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger <b>counterculture.</b>|$|E

5|$|Mukunda and Janaki met up {{with friends}} from college, who would later {{come to be known}} as Shyamasundar Das, Gurudas, Malati Dasi, and Yamuna Dasi. Teaming up with them, Mukunda rented a {{storefront}} in the San Francisco Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, which at that time was turning into the hub of the hippie <b>counterculture,</b> and stayed to take care of the developing new center.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{attended}} Stanford University {{during the}} 1965-66 academic year. He {{was not part}} of the <b>counterculture</b> of the 1960s then taking form in the San Francisco Bay Area. As opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War grew, a group staged a May 1966 sit-in at Stanford's administration building to demonstrate against draft status tests; Romney joined a counter-protest against that group. He continued to enjoy occasional pranks.|$|E
5|$|The <b>counterculture</b> was a youth {{movement}} that included political activism, especially {{in opposition to}} the Vietnam War, and the promotion of various hippie ideals. The hippies were associated primarily with two kinds of music: the folk-rock and country rock of people like Bob Dylan and Gram Parsons, and the psychedelic rock of bands like Jefferson Airplane and The Doors. This movement was very closely connected to the British Invasion, a wave of bands from the United Kingdom who became popular throughout much of the 1960s. The British Invasion initially included bands like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and The Zombies who were later joined by bands like the Moody Blues and The Who. The sound of these bands was hard-edged rock, with the Beatles originally known for songs that resembled classic black rock songs by Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Smokey Robinson, The Shirelles and the Isley Brothers. Later, as the <b>counterculture</b> developed, The Beatles began using more advanced techniques and unusual instruments, such as the sitar, as well as more original lyrics.|$|E
50|$|Finally, as Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg relates in Angst und Vorurteil, just as {{colonialism}} {{and the rise}} of syphilis had compromised the scientific Enlightenment approach to sexuality, the impact of HIV corrupted post-WWII progressive <b>counterculture's</b> influence on Western society's attitudes towards sexuality.|$|R

5|$|Until the 1960s, {{administrative}} {{review of}} student publications was considered routine {{at both the}} high school and collegiate level. However, with the rise of the <b>counterculture</b> of the 1960s, student publications began to explore social issues with greater fervor, focusing on the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, sexual orientation, and other topics considered controversial at the time.|$|E
5|$|Adi Da {{initially}} {{became known}} in the spiritual <b>counterculture</b> of the 1970s for his books and public talks, and for the activities of his religious community. His philosophy was essentially similar to many eastern religions which see spiritual enlightenment as the ultimate priority of human life. Distinguishing his from other religious traditions, Adi Da declared {{that he was a}} uniquely historic avatar (incarnation of a god or divinity in human form). As such, Adi Da stated that henceforth devotional worship of him would be the sole means of spiritual enlightenment for anyone else.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the city}} of Santa Cruz already {{exhibited}} a strong conservation ethic before {{the founding of the}} university, the coincidental rise of the <b>counterculture</b> of the 1960s with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area. The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc. A large and growing population of politically liberal UCSC alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly Republican to markedly left-leaning, consistently voting against expansion measures {{on the part of both}} town and gown.|$|E
50|$|A youth {{subculture}} is a youth-based subculture with distinct styles, behaviors, and interests. Youth subcultures offer participants {{an identity}} {{outside of that}} ascribed by social institutions such as family, work, home and school. Youth subcultures that show a systematic hostility to the dominant culture are sometimes described as <b>countercultures.</b>|$|R
50|$|Alan Bisbort's survey, Beatniks: A Guide to an American Subculture, was {{published}} by Greenwood Press in 2009 {{as part of the}} Greenwood Press Guides to Subcultures and <b>Countercultures</b> series.

500|$|Coinciding {{with the}} <b>counterculture's</b> preoccupation with enlightenment, 1967 marked {{the period when}} LSD use had become {{widespread}} among rock musicians and their audience. In a 1999 interview with Billboard magazine, Harrison said his aim had been [...] "to write a rock'n'roll song about the whole psychedelic thing of the time".|$|R
5|$|Before the 1960s, {{explicit}} sexuality of {{any kind}} was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by {{the civil rights movement}} and the emergence of a <b>counterculture.</b> New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Fonda was {{a visible}} {{political}} activist in the <b>counterculture</b> era during the Vietnam War {{and later became}} involved in advocacy for women. She was famously and controversially photographed sitting on an anti-aircraft gun on a 1972 visit to Hanoi. She has also protested the Iraq War and violence against women, and describes herself as a feminist. In 2005, she, Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem co-founded the Women's Media Center, an organization that works to amplify the voices {{of women in the}} media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content. Fonda serves {{on the board of the}} organization.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Bernard Milk (May 22, 1930 – November 27, 1978) was an American {{politician}} {{and the first}} openly gay elected official {{in the history of}} California, where {{he was elected to the}} San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Although he was the most pro-LGBT politician in the United States at the time, politics and activism were not his early interests; he was neither open about his sexuality nor civically active until he was 40, after his experiences in the <b>counterculture</b> movement of the 1960s.|$|E

5000|$|According to John McMillian, {{author of}} the 2011 book Smoking Typewriters, The Rag [...] "was a spirited, quirky, and humorous paper, whose founders pushed the New Left's {{political}} agenda even as they embraced the <b>counterculture's</b> zeal for rock music, psychedelics, and personal liberation," [...] and, according to historian Douglas Rossinow, the paper was [...] "enormously important to local activists." ...|$|R
5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, the <b>counterculture</b> of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E
5|$|Lennon's former {{personal}} assistant Fred Seaman (who was earlier convicted for and admitted stealing from Lennon's personal belongings) has claimed that by this time, however, Lennon had also quietly renounced the <b>counterculture</b> views {{which he had}} helped promote during the 1960s and 1970s and became more aligned with conservatism and was supportive of Ronald Reagan, though whether he had actually aligned to a more conservative world view is disputed. Some commentators noted that Seaman's claims have low credibility, considering {{that he was a}} thief who had abused his position to steal from Lennon, and had also earlier released a book with dubious allegations about Lennon which had largely been ignored.|$|E
5|$|Regarded as a {{major event}} in British culture, the festival is {{inspired}} by the ethos of the hippie, <b>counterculture,</b> and free festival movements. It retains vestiges of these traditions, such as the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures and Healing Fields. After the 1970s, the festival took place almost every year and grew in size, {{with the number of}} attendees sometimes being swollen by gatecrashers. Michael Eavis hosted the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air Led Zeppelin concert at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music.|$|E
5000|$|Like much of Southern's work, Red-Dirt Marijuana and Other Tastes {{presents}} a detailed portrait of American culture during the 1950s.

5000|$|Aldous Huxley, {{author of}} Brave New World, became a user of psychedelics {{after moving to}} Hollywood. He was at the {{forefront}} of the <b>counterculture's</b> experimentation with psychedelic drugs, which led to his 1954 work The Doors of Perception. Dying from cancer, he asked his wife on 22 November 1963 to inject him with 100 µg of LSD. He died later that day.|$|R
5000|$|Generation X, {{commonly}} {{abbreviated to}} Gen X, is the generation following the baby boomers.

The term has also been used in different times and places {{for a number of}} different subcultures or <b>countercultures</b> since the 1950s.|$|R
