40|$|During {{the actual}} {{measurement}} of the camera's intrinsic <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> performance, the input <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> are calculated by dividing the <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> measured during the 100 sec count by {{the product of the}} attenuation factors of the plates that have been removed. This, however, {{does not take into account}} the broad-beam conditions of the experiment. The broad beam attenuation factors can be measured directly by a method similar to that used to measure the attenuation factors of the individual plates. Figure 1 shows that the product of the attenuation factors of several plates is not equal to the measured attenuation factors of those same plates. This discrepancy causes errors in the <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> response curve for high <b>count</b> <b>rates.</b> Since the attenuation factor appears in the denominator ofthe expression for the input <b>count</b> <b>rate,</b> the input <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> is underestimated if the broad-beam attenuation factors are not used. This changes the shape of the <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> curve, and alters the value of the <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> corresponding to a 20 % loss. Figure 2 shows curves obtained with the multiplied attenuation factors and with the broad beam attenuation factors. In this case, the 20 % loss <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> changes from 155, 000 cps for the standard method, to 135, 000 cps for the broad-beam method. It can also be observedfrom Figure 2 that the <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> response curve shows extra counts at low <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> while the output <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> exceeds the input <b>count</b> <b>rate.</b> Through out the experiment, scatter was reduced by using a thick lead pot, and changes in background were eliminated by ensuring that no other sources of activity were near the camera room. Spectra were analyzed for several thicknesses of copper by connecting a multi-channel analyzer to the z-output of the camera. <b>Count</b> <b>rates</b> were kept in the linear range of the camera's response so that only changes in the source spectrum, and not the changes in the camera's performance, would be detected.

5000|$|A {{particle}} detector (implemented {{through use of}} an Anton type 213 Geiger-Müller tube) {{to measure}} lower radiation (especially near Venus), {{also known as the}} Iowa detector, as it was provided by the University of Iowa. It was a miniature tube having a 1.2 mg/cm2 mica window about 0.3 cm in diameter and weighing about 60 g. It detected soft x-rays efficiently and ultraviolet inefficiently, and was previously used in Injun 1, Explorer 12 and Explorer 14. It was able to detect protons above 500 keV in energy and electrons above 35 keV. The length of the basic telemetry frame was 887.04 seconds. During each frame, the <b>counting</b> <b>rate</b> of the detector was sampled twice at intervals separated by 37 seconds. The first sampling was the number of counts during an interval of 9.60 seconds (known as the 'long gate'); the second was the number of counts during an interval of 0.827 seconds (known as the 'short gate'). The long gate accumulator overflowed on the 256th count and the short gate accumulator overflowed on the 65,536th count. The maximum <b>counting</b> <b>rate</b> of the tube was 50,000 per second.|$|E
50|$|One {{would like}} to be able to {{interpret}} the return period in probabilistic models. The most logical interpretation for this is to take the return period as the <b>counting</b> <b>rate</b> in a Poisson distribution since it is the expectation value of the rate of occurrences. An alternative interpretation is to take it as the probability for a yearly Bernoulli Trial in the Binomial Distribution. This is disfavoured because each year does not represent an independent Bernoulli trial but is an arbitrary measure of time. This question is mainly academic as the results obtained will be similar under both the Poisson and Binomial interpretations.|$|E

It detected 7 small solar bursts of radiation during September and October and 2 during November and December.

30|$|Another {{potential}} source of intra-calibration source variability is difference in dead-time losses at the different time points due to the differences in source strength. For example, the <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> 6  days after source preparation (day 6) would be 60 % of the <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> {{on the day of}} preparation (day 0). Thus, the <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> on day 0 would be affected more by dead-time effects, and the decay- and background-corrected <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> from day 8 would be larger than those from day 0. However, the average <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> for the calibration sources in these experiments were on the order of 150 cps, and the <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> losses are thus expected to be very small. To verify this, we computed the difference divided by the mean (i.e., the relative difference) between the background- and decay-corrected <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> for each pair of time points for each patient. To be specific, we computed these relative differences between the <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> for time points 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 1 and 3 after background correction and dead-time correction to the time of acquisition for point 1. If dead-time effects were important, then we would expect systematic differences in the relative differences in the <b>count</b> <b>rates</b> for the various pairs of time points. For each of these pairs, we computed the average and standard deviations of the relative differences and tested the null hypothesis that these relative differences were non-zero. The average relative differences were all small (< 0.11 %) and the differences were not statistically significant (p[*]>[*] 0.5 for all three cases). This confirms that <b>count</b> <b>rate</b> effects were too small to explain the observed intra-calibration source variability.|$|R

The purpose of this hole is to allow the beam pipe to reach the measurement position so that the tape can be positioned {{in the center of}} the detector. It also allows the placement of ancillary detectors in the opposite side to measure other types of radiation emitted by the activity implanted in the tape (x rays, e−/e+, etc.). However, the presence of this hole makes this detector less efficient as compared to the GSI TAS (Lucrecia’s total efficiency is around 90% from 300 to 3000 keV).

50|$|Neutron {{porosity}} {{logging tools}} contain an americium-beryllium neutron source, which irradiates the formation with neutrons. These neutrons lose energy through elastic collisions with nuclei in the formation. Once their energy has decreased to thermal level, they diffuse randomly {{away from the}} source and are ultimately absorbed by a nucleus. Hydrogen atoms have essentially the same mass as the neutron; therefore hydrogen is the main contributor to the slowing down of neutrons. A detector at {{some distance from the}} source records the number of neutron reaching this point. Neutrons that have been slowed down to thermal level have a high probability of being absorbed by the formation before reaching the detector. The neutron <b>counting</b> <b>rate</b> is therefore inversely related to the amount of hydrogen in the formation. Since hydrogen is mostly present in pore fluids (water, hydrocarbons) the count rate can be converted into apparent porosity. Modern neutron logging tools usually include two detectors to compensate for some borehole effects. Porosity is derived from the ratio of count rates at these two detectors rather than from count rates at a single detector.|$|E
5000|$|The TDC is an ion {{counting}} detector - it can {{be extremely}} fast (down to a few picosecond resolution), but its dynamic range is limited due to its inability to properly count the events when more than one ions simultaneously hit the detector. The outcome of limited dynamic range is {{that the number of}} ions detected in one spectrum is somewhat small. This problem of limited dynamic range can be alleviated using multichannel detector design: an array of mini-anodes attached to a common MCP stack and multiple TDC, where each TDC records signals from individual mini-anode. To obtain peaks with statistically acceptable intensities, ion counting is accompanied by summing of hundreds of individual mass spectra (so-called hystograming). To reach a very high <b>counting</b> <b>rate</b> (limited only by duration of individual TOF spectrum, ~ 200 microsecond in long or multipath TOF setups), a very high repetition rate of ion extractions to the TOF tube is used. Orthogonal acceleration TOF mass analyzers operate at 20-30 kHz repetition rates. In combined mass spectra obtained by summing a large number of individual ion detection events, each peak is a histogram obtained by adding up counts in each individual bin. Because the recording of the individual ion arrival with TDC produces only a single time point (e.g., a time [...] "bin" [...] correspondent to the maximum of the electrical pulse produced in a single-ion detection event), the TDC eliminates the fraction of peak width in combined spectra determined by a limited response time of the MCP detector. This propagates into better mass resolution.|$|E

50|$|Even with {{chemical}} quenching, {{for a short}} time after a discharge pulse there is a period during which the tube is rendered insensitive and is thus temporarily unable to detect the arrival of any new ionizing particle (the so-called dead time; typically 50-100 microseconds).
