This is especially useful in terrestrial links as the linear relationship {{can be used to}} determine <b>rainfall</b> <b>rate</b> from attenuation of a link. This is advantageous for finding <b>rainfall</b> <b>rates</b> in areas that are poorly gauged. Six years of disdrometer data from Chilbolton, UK, was used to determine <b>rainfall</b> <b>rate</b> and attenuation. The results showed a region of frequencies where relationship between <b>rainfall</b> <b>rate</b> and attenuation can be considered linear.

There is current interest in the use of inverse methods to estimate rainfall over areas inferred from terrestrial links.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn experiment by the Naval Postgraduate School and the National Data Buoy Center {{was performed in}} the Gulf of Mexico to characterize the underwater sound generated by heavy precipitation and to determine if <b>rainfall</b> <b>rates</b> of heavy precipitation can be measured using underwater sound. During {{this stage of the}} experiment, twentytwo data sets were recorded with <b>rainfall</b> <b>rates</b> up to 340 mm/hr. For a given <b>rainfall</b> <b>rate,</b> it is found that sound levels from heavy convective precipitation are higher {{at the beginning of the}} storm and when the <b>rainfall</b> <b>rate</b> is increasing than at the end of the storm event or when <b>rainfall</b> <b>rates</b> are decreasing. This may be due to changes in the drop size distribution during the life cycle of the storm or to variations in the temperature difference between the raindrop and the ocean surface. Very heavy <b>rainfall</b> (<b>rate</b> > 150 mm/hr) generates near surface bubble layers or bubble clouds which attenuate sound energy at higher frequencies (> 15 kHz). The distinctive 15 kHz peak in the sound spectrum for light rain is absent during heavy rain suggesting that the sound production mechanism previously identified for small drops (0. 8 - 1. 1 mm in diameter) is suppressed by heavy rain even though those small drops are undoubtedly present during heavy <b>rainfall</b> <b>rates.</b> These data show a very high correlation between underwater sound level and the logarithm of the <b>rainfall</b> <b>rate</b> except when high wind speeds (> 10 m/s) and high <b>rainfall</b> <b>rates</b> (> 150 mm/hr) are present. An empirical <b>rainfall</b> <b>rate</b> algorithm for con-vcctive precipitation is proposed suggesting that sound energy is directly proportional to <b>rainfall</b> <b>rate,</b> however any empirical algorithm which does not adjust for changing. storm characteristics should be used with caution.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{calculate}} and predict the missing <b>rainfall</b> <b>rate</b> data {{by comparing the}} ac- tual data and the calculation. This study used daily <b>rainfall</b> <b>rate</b> data from 1990 to 2000 at three stations, namely Fajar Esuk, Panutan and Podorejo in Kabupaten Pringsewu. Data analysis were conducted using reciprocal method and periodic stochastic model. The recip- rocal method was calculated by using the daily <b>rainfall</b> <b>rate</b> data and the closest distance between two stations and the research object. Meanwhile, the periodic stochastic model was calculated by using the daily <b>rainfall</b> <b>rate</b> data for 512 days all year long. Then, the periodic model of the daily <b>rainfall</b> <b>rate</b> was established by using Fourier equation and least squares method.
