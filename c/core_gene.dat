40|$|Abstract Background Technological {{advances}} in high throughput genome sequencing are making whole genome sequencing (WGS) {{available as a}} routine tool for bacterial typing. Standardized procedures for identification of relevant genes and of variation are needed to enable comparison between studies and over time. The <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> [...] the genes that are conserved in all (or most) members of a genus or species [...] are potentially good candidates for investigating genomic variation in phylogeny and epidemiology. Results We identify a set of 2, 882 <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> clusters based on 73 publicly available Salmonella enterica genomes and evaluate their value as typing targets, comparing whole genome typing and traditional methods such as 16 S and MLST. A consensus tree based on variation of <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> gives much better resolution than 16 S and MLST; the pan-genome family tree {{is similar to the}} consensus tree, but with higher confidence. The <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> can be divided into two categories: a few highly variable genes and a larger set of conserved <b>core</b> <b>genes,</b> with low variance. For the most variable <b>core</b> <b>genes,</b> the variance in amino acid sequences is higher than for the corresponding nucleotide sequences, suggesting that there is a positive selection towards mutations leading to amino acid changes.

Analysing serial sample pairs of 33 chronically HBV-infected, untreated patients, with a cumulative follow-up of 184 years, the synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates of a part of the overlapping HBV surface and polymerase genes were compared to those of a nonoverlapping part of the HBV <b>core</b> <b>gene.</b> The substitution rate of the HBV <b>core</b> <b>gene</b> was higher (8. 15 x 10 (- 4) vs 4. 57 x 10 (- 4) substitutions/site/year) than that of the surface gene.

40|$|Abstract Background The Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV) {{constitute}} an apparently monophyletic group {{that consists of}} at least 6 families of viruses infecting a broad variety of eukaryotic hosts. A comprehensive genome comparison and maximum-likelihood reconstruction of the NCLDV evolution revealed a set of approximately 50 conserved, <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> that could be mapped to the genome of the common ancestor of this class of eukaryotic viruses. Results We performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis of these <b>core</b> NCLDV <b>genes</b> and applied the constrained tree approach {{to show that the}} majority of the <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> are unlikely to be monophyletic. Several of the <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> have been independently acquired from different sources by different NCLDV lineages whereas for the majority of these genes displacement by homologs from cellular organisms in one or more groups of the NCLDV was demonstrated.

The phylogenetic coherence between the <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> is sufficient to validate the hypothesis on the evolution of all NCLDV from a common ancestral virus although the set of ancestral genes might be smaller than previously inferred from patterns of gene presence-absence. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The genomic {{organisation}} of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) varies greatly {{between different}} vertebrates. In mammals, the classical MHC {{consists of a}} large number of linked genes (e. g. greater than 200 in humans) with predominantly immune function. In some birds, it consists of only a small number of linked MHC <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> (e. g. smaller than 20 in chickens) forming a minimal essential MHC and, in fish, the MHC consists of a so far unknown number of genes including non-linked MHC <b>core</b> <b>genes.</b> Here we report a survey of MHC genes and their paralogues in the zebrafish genome. Results Using sequence similarity searches against the zebrafish draft genome assembly (Zv 4, September 2004), 149 putative MHC gene loci and their paralogues have been identified. Of these, 41 map to chromosome 19 while the remaining loci are spread across essentially all chromosomes. Despite the fragmentation, a set of MHC <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> involved in peptide transport, loading and presentation are still found in a single linkage group.

40|$|The way {{to infer}} well-supported phylogenetic trees that {{precisely}} reflect the evolutionary {{process is a}} challenging task that completely depends {{on the way the}} related <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> have been found. In previous computational biology studies, many similarity based algorithms, mainly dependent on calculating sequence alignment matrices, have been proposed to find them. In these kinds of approaches, a significantly high similarity score between two coding sequences extracted from a given annotation tool means that one has the same genes. In a previous work article, we presented a quality test approach (QTA) that improves the <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> quality by combining two annotation tools (namely NCBI, a partially human-curated database, and DOGMA, an efficient annotation algorithm for chloroplasts).

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) <b>core</b> <b>gene</b> {{heterogeneity}} {{may influence}} the outcome of liver disease and the response to interferon (IFN) therapy in adult HBV carriers. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the possible association between HBV <b>core</b> <b>gene</b> variability and evolution of chronic hepatitis in children. METHODS: We examined serum samples from 25 children with HBV chronic hepatitis and HBe antigen (HBeAg) positivity who were followed-up for a mean of 7. 4 years. Seven cases spontaneously seroconverted to anti-HBe, becoming HBV healthy carriers; nine cases were successfully treated with IFN; nine cases were non-responders to IFN therapy. HBV-DNA was extracted from one serum sample ("I") collected during the HBeAg positive phase, and from a second sample ("II") collected after the anti-HBe seroconversion or, in non-responders, after stopping therapy. The entire <b>core</b> <b>gene</b> of the HBV isolates was amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: Each isolate showed single or no missense mutation independently of the clinical behavior of the patients. HBeAg-defective viruses were detected in one case in both samples and in two cases only in sample "II". CONCLUSIONS: <b>Core</b> <b>gene</b> variability does not seem to be involved either in the outcome of infection or in the response to IFN treatment in children with HBV chronic hepatitis.

Transient expression of this construct in hepatoma cells resulted in formation of particles indistinguishable from HBV (Dane particles).

Using the recently available data set on the E. coli protein-protein interaction network, we sought to explore the impact of HGT on genome structure and protein networks. Results We classified the E. coli genes into three categories based on their evolutionary conservation: a set of 2158 <b>Core</b> <b>genes</b> that are shared by all E. coli strains, a set of 1044 Non-core genes that are strain-specific, and a set of 1053 genes that were putatively acquired by horizontal transfer. We observed a clear correlation between gene expressivity (measured by Codon Adaptation Index), evolutionary rates, and node connectivity between these categories of genes. Specifically, we found the <b>Core</b> <b>genes</b> are the most highly expressed and the most slowly evolving, while the HGT genes are expressed at the lowest level and evolve at the highest rate. <b>Core</b> <b>genes</b> are the most likely and HGT genes are the least likely to be member of the operons. In addition, we found the <b>Core</b> <b>genes</b> on average are more highly connected than Non-core and HGT genes in the protein interaction network, however the HGT genes displayed a significantly higher mean node degree than the <b>Core</b> and Non-core <b>genes</b> in the defence COG functional category. Interestingly, HGT genes {{are more likely to be}} connected to <b>Core</b> <b>genes</b> than expected by chance, which suggest a model of differential attachment in the expansion of cellular networks.

The genomes of all the known marine cyanopodoviruses are highly syntenic. A pan-genome of 349 clustered orthologous groups was determined, among which 15 were <b>core</b> <b>genes.</b> These <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> make up nearly half of each genome in length, reflecting {{the high level of}} genome conservation among this cyanophage type. The whole genome phy-logenies based on concatenated <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> and gene content were highly consistent and confirmed the separation of two discrete marine cyanopodovirus clusters MPP-A and MPP-B. The genomes within cluster MPP-B grouped into subclusters mainly corresponding to Prochlorococcus or Synechococcus host types. Auxiliary metabolic genes tend to occur in a specific phylogenetic group of these cyanopodoviruses. All the MPP-B phages analyzed here encode the photosynthesis gene psbA, which are absent in all the MPP-A genome...|$|R
40|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} {{are produced}} mostly by clustered genes {{that are essential}} to their biosynthesis. The transcriptional expression of these genes is often cooperatively regulated by a transcription factor located inside or close to a cluster. Most of the secondary metabolism biosynthesis (SMB) gene clusters identified to date contain so-called <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> with distinctive sequence features, such as polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Recent efforts in sequencing fungal genomes have revealed far more SMB gene clusters than expected {{based on the number}} of <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> in the genomes. Several bioinformatics tools have been developed to survey SMB gene clusters using the sequence motif information of the <b>core</b> <b>genes,</b> including SMURF and antiSMASH. More recently, accompanied by the development of sequencing techniques allowing to obtain large-scale genomic and transcriptomic data, motif-independent prediction methods of SMB gene clusters, including MIDDAS-M, have been developed. Most these methods detect the clusters in which the genes are cooperatively regulated at transcriptional levels, thus allowing the identification of novel SMB gene clusters regardless of the presence of the <b>core</b> <b>genes.</b> Another type of the method, MIPS-CG, uses the characteristics of SMB genes, which are highly enriched in non-syntenic blocks (NSBs), enabling the prediction even without transcriptome data although the results have not been evaluated in detail. Considering that large portion of SMB gene clusters might be sufficiently expressed only in limited uncommon conditions, it seems that prediction of SMB gene clusters by bioinformatics and successive experimental validation is an only way to efficiently uncover hidden SMB gene clusters. Here, we describe and discuss possible novel approaches for the determination of SMB gene clusters that have not been identified using conventional methods...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The prokaryotic pangenome {{partitions}} <b>genes</b> into <b>core</b> and dispensable <b>genes.</b> The {{order of}} <b>core</b> <b>genes,</b> albeit {{assumed to be}} stable under selection in general, is frequently interrupted by horizontal gene transfer and rearrangement, but how a core-gene-defined genomemaintains its stability or flexibility remains to be investigated. Based on data from 30 species, including 425 genomes from six phyla, we grouped <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> into syntenic blocks {{in the context of}} a pangenome according to their stabil-ity across multiple isolates. A subset of the <b>core</b> <b>genes,</b> often species specific and lineage associated, formed a core-gene-defined genome organizational framework (cGOF). Such cGOFs are either single segmental (one-third of the species analyzed) or multi-segmental (the rest). Multisegment cGOFs were further classified into symmetric or asymmetric according to segment orienta-tions toward the origin-terminus axis. The cGOFs in Gram-positive species are exclusively symmetric and often reversible in orientation, as opposed to those of the Gram-negative bacteria, which are all asymmetric and irreversible. Meanwhile, all species showing strong strand-biased gene distribution contain symmetric cGOFs and often specific DnaE (subunit of DNA polymer-ase III) isoforms. Furthermore, functional evaluations revealed that cGOF genes are hub associated with regard to cellular activi-ties, and the stability of cGOF provides efficient indexes for scaffold orientation as demonstrated by assembling virtual and em-pirical genome drafts. cGOFs show species specificity, and the symmetry of multisegmental cGOFs is conserved among taxa an...|$|R
40|$|Hepatic {{steatosis}} and {{insulin resistance}} are factors that aggravate {{the progression of}} liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In the pathogenesis of liver disease and metabolic disorders in HCV infection, oxidative stress due to mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction plays a pivotal role. Tacrolimus (FK 506) is supposed to protect mitochondrial respiratory function. We studied whether tacrolimus affects the development of HCV-associated liver disease using HCV <b>core</b> <b>gene</b> transgenic mice, which develop hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Administration of tacrolimus to HCV <b>core</b> <b>gene</b> transgenic mice three times per week for 3 months led to {{a significant reduction in}} the amounts of lipid in the liver as well as in serum insulin. Tacrolimus treatment also ameliorated oxidative stress and DNA damage in the liver of the <b>core</b> <b>gene</b> transgenic mice. Tacrolimus administration reproduced these effects in a dose-dependent manner in HepG 2 cells expressing the core protein. The intrahepatic level of tumor necrosis factor-α, which may be a key molecule for the pathogenesis in HCV infection, was significantly decreased in tacrolimus-treated <b>core</b> <b>gene</b> transgenic mice. Tacrolimus thus reversed the effect of the core protein in the pathogenesis of HCV-associated liver disease. These results may provide new therapeutic tools for chronic hepatitis C, in which oxidative stress and abnormalities in lipid and glucose metabolism contribute to liver pathogenesis...|$|E
30|$|Although the in vivo and {{in vitro}} {{datasets}} were generated from different experimental materials {{as well as}} different instruments, they both stem from the same cell type: monocyte. By extracting the overlapped genes between in vivo and in vitro data, a <b>core</b> <b>gene</b> list including 541 unique genes was generated (Table S 2). With high repeatability and reliability between the independent in vivo and in vitro experiments, the overlapped genes {{are most likely to}} reflect the biological functions related to human monocyte exactly and objectively. Therefore, we performed gene-disease association analysis {{on the basis of the}} <b>core</b> <b>gene</b> list. First, we downloaded the whole gene-disease association dataset for the DisGeNET database ([URL] which contains about 50 thousand associations between different genes and diseases. The associations are all supported by experimental evidence or previous publications. Secondly, we mapped our <b>core</b> <b>gene</b> list to the entire knowledge base, so that all of the gene-disease associations corresponding to the provided genes could be extracted; one gene may be involved in several diseases, and one disease may involve numerous genes.|$|E
40|$|Recombinant DNA {{molecules}} {{consisting of}} the simian virus 40 (SV 40) early region and different subgenomic hepatitis B virus DNA fragments were constructed in vitro and packaged in vivo into SV 40 capsids by using a complementing SV 40 helper virus. Upon infection with these virus stocks the three known hepatitis B-specific antigens were expressed under SV 40 control. The surface antigen was released into the medium, and the core antigen and its derivative hepatitis B e antigen were only detected intracellularly. Size analysis of the <b>core</b> <b>gene</b> product(s) by immunoblotting revealed {{the presence of a}} single protein species identical with the 21 -kilodalton core antigen isolated from human liver. The hepatitis B core antigen expressing construct did not contain a putative precore sequence, indicating that such a sequence is not needed for hepatitis B core antigen synthesis in animal cells. S 1 analysis demonstrated the use of SV 40 signals for initiation and polyadenylation of the <b>core</b> <b>gene</b> transcripts. In addition, a processing-polyadenylation signal was identified within the <b>core</b> <b>gene...</b>|$|E
40|$|Many {{bioactive}} {{natural products}} are produced as "secondary metabolites" by plants, bacteria, and fungi. During {{the middle of}} the 20 th century, several secondary metabolites from fungi revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry, for example, penicillin, lovastatin, and cyclosporine. They are generally biosynthesized by enzymes encoded by clusters of coordinately regulated genes, and several motif-based methods have been developed to detect secondary metabolite biosynthetic (SMB) gene clusters using the sequence information of typical SMB <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> such as polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). However, no detection method exists for SMB gene clusters that are functional and do not include <b>core</b> SMB <b>genes</b> at present. To advance the exploration of SMB gene clusters, especially those without known <b>core</b> <b>genes,</b> we developed MIDDAS-M, a motif-independent de novodetection algorithm for SMB gene clusters. We integrated virtual gene cluster generation in an annotated genome sequence with highly sensitive scoring of the cooperative transcriptional regulation of cluster member genes. MIDDAS-M accurately predicted 38 SMB gene clusters that have been experimentally confirmed and/or predicted by other motif-based methods in 3 fungal strains. MIDDAS-M further identified a new SMB gene cluster for ustiloxin B, which was experimentally validated. Sequence analysis of the cluster genes indicated a novel mechanism for peptide biosynthesis independent of NRPS. Because it is fully computational and independent of empirical knowledge about SMB <b>core</b> <b>genes,</b> MIDDAS-M allows a large-scale, comprehensive analysis of SMB gene clusters, including those with novel biosynthetic mechanisms that do not contain any functionally characterized genes...|$|R
40|$|The family Baculoviridae is a {{large group}} of insect viruses {{containing}} circular double-stranded DNA genomes of 80 to 180 kbp, which have broad biotechnological applications. A key feature to understand andmanipulate them is the recognition of orthol-ogy. However, the differences in gene contents and evolutionary distances among the knownmembers of this family make it dif-ficult to assign sequence orthology. In this study, the genome sequences of 58 baculoviruses were analyzed, with the aim to detect previously undescribed <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> because of their remote homology. A routine based onMulti PSI-Blast/tBlastN andMulti HaMStR allowed us to detect 31 of 33 accepted <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> and 4 orthologous sequences in the Baculoviridaewhich were not de-scribed previously. Our results show that the ac 53, ac 78, ac 101 (p 40), and ac 103 (p 48) genes have orthologs in all genomes and should be considered <b>core</b> <b>genes.</b> Accordingly, there are 37 orthologous genes in the family Baculoviridae. The family Baculoviridae is composed of insect-specific DNAviruses containing covalently closed, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes that vary in size from approximately 80 to 180 kbp and encode 90 to 180 open reading frames (ORFs). This viral family is divided into four genera,Alphabaculovirus,Betabaculovirus, Gammabaculovirus, andDeltabaculovirus, which include lepidopter-an-specific baculoviruses, lepidopteran-specific granuloviruses, hy-menopteran-specific baculoviruses, and dipteran-specific baculo...|$|R
40|$|Defining {{bacterial}} {{species is}} still a debatable topic among bacteriologists. It has become clear that, periodic selection and recombination are two main drivers of bacterial species. Here, we are curious to study the diversity and structure of a local population. For which, we studied a population that was comprised of two symbiovars of R. leguminosarum. The draft genomes of 72 isolates (36 viciae & 36 trifolii) from a square meter of soil were sequenced by Roche 454 sequencing and compared with the published genome of Rlv 3841. Chapter Two employs 305 <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> and genomic analysis to demonstrate the existence of five phenotypically indistinguishable (cryptic) genospecies in a local population. Most of the cryptic genospecies include both viciae and trifolii strains: the genospecies {{do not reflect the}} symbiovars. Chapter Three demonstrates that recombination {{plays a major role in}} shaping the chromosome of R. leguminosarum. Moreover, it demonstrates the preference of intra- genospecies recombination highlighting the occurrence of genetic isolation between genospecies that allows them to be represented as biological species. Chapter Four demonstrates the presence of <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> on different plasmids. The phylogenetic structure of Rlv 3841 replicons resembles the structure of <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> phylogeny indicating lack of genes transfer between genospecies in each replicon. However, the phylogenetic networks suggest horizontal transfer of nod genes that allow species members to have different host specificity. Chapter Five displays the genetic diversity present between two major genospecies (B and C) of R. leguminosarum. Overall, our results provide direct evidence that <b>core</b> <b>genes</b> and genomic analysis such as ANI should be used to define bacterial species. Moreover, the host specific symbiotic genes are normal accessory genes that have no significant role in the demarcation of bacterial species...|$|R
