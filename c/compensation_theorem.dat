40|$|Steady-state {{analysis}} of soft-switching converters {{is discussed in}} this paper. Finding the steady-state solution of soft-switching converters by means of start-up transient simulation may involve onerous computations and convergence failure, because of the mix of fast and slow natural frequencies determined respectively {{by the presence of}} soft-switching Lr-Cr cells elements and bulky L-C filter elements. The numerical method proposed in this paper shows high reliability and fast convergence, thanks to the adoption of an interval analysis based technique for the detection of commutations and of a <b>compensation</b> <b>theorem</b> based technique for the {{analysis of}} commutations. Some examples of steady-state analysis of two dc-dc converters, an inverter and a power factor corrector are presented to highlight the good performances of the simulation algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The {{reciprocity}} theorem {{is among the}} most intriguing concepts in wave field theory and has {{become an integral part of}} almost all standard textbooks on electromagnetic (EM) theory. This book makes use of the theorem to quantitatively describe EM interactions concerning general multiport antenna systems. It covers a general reciprocity-based description of antenna systems, their EM scattering properties, and further related aspects. Beginning with an introduction to the subject, Electromagnetic Reciprocity in Antenna Theory provides readers first with the basic prerequisites before offering coverage of the equivalent multiport circuit antenna representations, EM coupling between multiport antenna systems and their EM interactions with scatterers, accompanied with the corresponding EM <b>compensation</b> <b>theorems...</b>|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2004 IEEEInhomogeneous ground {{can cause}} {{significant}} scattering of incident electromagnetic fields. For example, {{the introduction of}} a metallic ground mat can {{have a significant effect on}} the radiation pattern of an antenna. Several approaches to the problem have been developed and most are based on integral electromagnetic formulations such as the extinction and <b>compensation</b> <b>theorems.</b> The extinction theorem approach derives the leading order behaviour of the scattered field from the leading order behaviour of the incident field. For most practical situations, however, the field becomes extremely weak close to the ground, and higher order terms are required. The paper extends earlier work (Coleman, C. J., 1996, 1997, 1998, 2003) on the extinction theorem approach to these higher order terms. The procedure for calculating the leading order scattered field is described and it is shown how this process can be extended to the calculation of higher order terms. Finally, the procedure is used to derive an expression for the field of a general antenna in the vicinity of inhomogeneous ground. In the case of large inhomogeneous features, the theory predicts behaviour that is expected from the results of other approaches...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology for line outage ranking based on reactive compensation index (RCI). RCI {{has been used}} extensively at BC Hydro, Burby, Canada for assessing the voltage stability. A methodology has been developed to evaluate quickly RCI using the π section model for active power flow and <b>compensation</b> injection <b>theorem,</b> RCI is specifically calculated, using only the results of base case load flow, under each line outage condition. RCI approximates the distance between pre-contingency nose and line outage case nose by the total reactive injection required at the load buses to establish similar voltage levels for the two cases. Hence RCI {{has been used as}} severity index for ranking the line outages. Ranking results have been obtained for a sample test system and compared with those obtained using Performance Index method. K e y w o r d s: voltage stability; proximity indicators; rankin...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of a {{systematic}} study of the single impurity Anderson model based on a perturbative approach. Our work provides new and exact results for a number of quantities of interest. In particular we have investigated the impurity spin susceptibility as well as the spatial dependence of the spin correlation density. In view of the versatility of the technique our calculations have been carried out for several specific models of the conduction electron bare density of states ρ 0 (ω). Both dynamical as well as thermodynamical properties have been investigated. Our results are compared with the ones obtained by means of the renormalization group analysis and recent quantum Monte Carlo studies. The breakdown of the Clogston-Anderson <b>compensation</b> <b>theorem</b> for realistic choices of ρ 0 (ω) is pointed out and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract：A new {{self-adjusting}} PID controller based fuzzy inferences is proposed. Using fuzzy inferences method, the PID parameters can {{be adjusted}} adaptively online for the varying state of the system. This approach has more significant performance and robustness than conventional PID contorllers in any conditions. Traditional fuzzy control systems have difficulties for plants with great delay．A fuzzy PID system based on the Smith <b>compensation</b> <b>theorem</b> is proposed in the paper．It allows to change the transfer function of the plant．Simulation results are also given． In the study of Biomedical Engineering, the requirements on temperature are very strict. The traditional temperature control system generally adopts PID control algorithm. However, in the temperature control process which using this algorithm, often encounter delay, {{and the existence of}} time delay affects the stability of the system seriously, cause the system overshoot becoming big...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a unified}} method for {{steady-state}} analysis of hard-switching and soft-switching DC-to-DC converters is presented. The power {{stage and the}} feedback control circuit forming the regulator are modeled separately and analyzed as two interconnected blocks. The intersection of the open loop DC steady-state characteristics of these cascaded blocks provides the initial condition for a guess candidate steady-state solution (CS). The CS is validated as true steady-state solution (TS) if the bias conditions of switching devices are fulfilled everywhere in the switching period, otherwise the CS is changed according to the conditions violated. The CS approaches the TS through an iterative process of validation. The basic tools adopted to ensure a reliable computation of the CS are interval analysis (IA), for {{the identification of the}} commutation instants (CI), and the <b>compensation</b> <b>theorem</b> (CT), for the analysis of commutations. Some examples of applications to hard-switching and soft-switching DC-DC regulators are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{most basic}} {{question}} {{we can ask}} {{in the study of}} circulants over a finite fields is the structure of the units in the circulant ring. With one exception, we shall provide a complete description of the isomorphism class of the unit group. But, we shall only provide a method of constructing these unit groups assuming generators to the units of various fields are given. We shall start with the notations used here which differ slightly from the main text on circulants. 1 Notation. (i) Denote the set of units in circn(F) by circ ∗ n(F). (ii) The symbol p will be reserved for a prime, and q will be reserved for some positive power of p. (iii) We shall use Fp (not Zp) to denote a field of p elements. Likewise, Fq shall be a field of q = p m elements. (iv) Φn(x) will as usual denote the n th cyclotomic polynomial, and φ(n), the Euler function, will denote its degree. (v) If an element generates the entire group of units it is called a primitive element. The finite characteristic of the field causes some complications. For example, the Fourier matrix is singular if the characteristic divides n, the order of the circulants. Indeed, we must regrettably exclude this case from the subsequent. However, finite fields do have some <b>compensations.</b> The first <b>theorem,</b> though standard, might be quite surprising to those familiar only with fields of characteristic zero. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the optimal}} design of {{electromagnetic}} devices, the robustness {{is a critical}} aspect. In the modern robust optimization procedures, the evaluation of suitable partial derivatives is required at {{each step of the}} search process; the estimate of the sensitivity is required also in non robust optimizations if the robustness of the final design with respect to a number of independent parameters must be assessed. On the other hand, the tolerance analysis is a widely adopted tool in the analysis of electromagnetic devices, whose main aim is {{to assess the impact of}} some independent uncertain parameters (e. g. geometrical dimensions or materials properties) on a device performance as, for example, the electromagnetic field in a volume of interest. Similar considerations apply when a general property in nominal design, such as symmetry, is lost due to non symmetrical deformations. In both cases - robust design and tolerance analysis - if assuming a linear behavior of the system, the classical <b>compensation</b> <b>theorem</b> can reveal to be a quite powerful tool...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the temperature dependence of the impurity spin susceptibility for a single-impurity Anderson model. Our analysis {{is based on a}} perturbative approach to the Anderson Hamiltonian in which the expansion parameter is proportional to U, the on-site Coulomb repulsion energy. We find that the perturbative expansion correctly reproduces the results obtained with the renormalization-group approach. Our work shows that, in most relevant cases, if the conduction-electron density of states is not taken to be a simple constant for all energies, the impurity spin-spin response function and the impurity spin susceptibility differ substantially. In fact, in calculating the latter, particular care must be exercised in order to properly include the effects induced on the conduction electrons by the presence of the impurity. For all practical purposes, this amounts to a breakdown of what is commonly referred to as the Clogston-Anderson <b>compensation</b> <b>theorem.</b> A condition allowing one to establish in most cases the relevance of these corrections is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in the numerical renormalization group (NRG) allow {{the construction of the}} full density matrix (FDM) of quantum impurity models (see A. Weichselbaum and J. von Delft) by using the completeness of the eliminated states introduced by F. B. Anders and A. Schiller (2005). While these developments prove particularly useful in the calculation of transient response and finite temperature Green's functions of quantum impurity models, they may also be used to calculate thermodynamic properties. In this paper, we assess the FDM approach to thermodynamic properties by applying it to the Anderson impurity model. We compare the results for the susceptibility and specific heat to both the conventional approach within NRG and to exact Bethe ansatz results. We also point out a subtlety in the calculation of the susceptibility (in a uniform field) within the FDM approach. Finally, we show numerically that for the Anderson model, the susceptibilities in response to a local and a uniform magnetic field coincide in the wide-band limit, in accordance with the Clogston-Anderson <b>compensation</b> <b>theorem.</b> Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, published versio...|$|E
40|$|In {{the optimal}} design of {{electromagnetic}} devices, the robustness {{is a critical}} aspect. In the modern robust optimization procedures, the evaluation of suitable partial derivatives is required to define sensitivity at {{each step of the}} search process; the estimate of the sensitivity is required also in non robust design if the robustness of the final configuration must be assessed with respect to a number of independent parameters.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the use of the <b>compensation</b> <b>theorem</b> (CT), well known in the {{analysis}} of linear electric networks, to compute sensitivity of the performance functions used in the robust design or tolerance analysis of electromagnetic devices. Design/methodology/approach – The CT is first illustrated in the case of a simple field analysis problem. Then, using numerical simulations, the effectiveness of compensation approach for assessing impact of the small modification of material properties is shown. The numerical simulations are performed with a finite elements code based on an integral formulation. Findings – The complexity of additional computations to assess the effect of small variations involved in sensitivity analysis can be reduced. Research limitations/implications – The method can be applied only to linear systems; in addition, although compensation applies to any variations, the reduction of computational complexity is achieved only for small variations, giving localized effects. Practical implications – The method proposed in the paper can speed up the computations of sensitivity arrays in the robust design and tolerance analysis of electromagnetic device, when numerical methods are applied. Originality/value – The use of CT in field computations is not new, but its adoption in the sensitivity computation is new to the best knowledge of authors...|$|E
40|$|There is {{ever-increasing}} {{interest in}} employing accurate values of Additional Secondary Factors (ASFs) in Loran-C receivers. Precise ASF values are essential if Loran is {{to deliver the}} high absolute accuracies now demanded of it for aircraft approaches, maritime harbour entrance guidance, and land vehicle tracking. In some situations, accurate ASFs can be measured. But in many other applications, we find it more economical to employ a computer model to predict ASFs, and then store the results within the Loran receiver itself. This paper will introduce readers unfamiliar with the concepts of ASFs to the principles involved. It will briefly review the use of measured and modelled ASF values {{in a range of}} applications. The BALOR computer model developed by the authors calculates the values of ASFs along complex propagation paths, taking into account the variations of both ground conductivity and land height between the transmitter and the receiver. It has been used to produce ASF data sets for the region served by every NELS Loran station, and many North American stations, too. These results are available in the form of maps and tables of numerical values. Typically, data points are spaced at intervals of 0. 01 o degree of latitude by 0. 01 o degree of longitude (approximately 1 x 1 km). Recently, the authors have extended the BALOR model to take into account more accurately the curvature of the earth at ranges beyond 1000 km. This extended model employs a more complex, and more accurate, integral equation. The equation was developed, using the <b>Compensation</b> <b>Theorem,</b> by Wait at the US National Bureau of Standards. It describes the changes in the amplitude and phase of the Loran signal as it propagates from the transmitter to the receiver. As in the existing BALOR model, Monteath’s numerical approach is then used to solve this integral equation. The paper will demonstrate the validity of this extended model by reference to NBS results, and present examples of ASF data it has produced for specific Loran stations...|$|E
