40|$|Caregivers {{of persons}} with {{dementia}} do not use <b>community</b> <b>resources</b> {{until late in the}} disease process, despite the fact that judicious use of <b>community</b> <b>resources</b> can delay nursing home admission. Data from the National Caregiver Training Project, based on Hall and Buckwalter’s (1987) progressively lowered stress threshold (PLST) model, were used to examine variables related to use of <b>community</b> <b>resources.</b> Spouse and adult child caregivers were divided into two groups based on amount of <b>community</b> <b>resources</b> used per week. Within this geographically diverse sample of caregivers, 64 % did not use professional services, 79 % did not use respite ser-vices, and 65 % did not use other services. Being a spouse decreased the odds that the caregiver would use <b>community</b> <b>resources.</b> Resource use was also related to the care recipient’s problems with activities of daily living and the increase in frequency of memory and behavioral problems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{relationships between}} 2 dimensions of social integration (community participation and affective <b>community</b> <b>resources)</b> and job and marital quality. Data from the 1995 National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (n 1, 816) {{indicate that the}} level of community participation is unrelated or negatively related to job and marital quality, whereas affective <b>community</b> <b>resources</b> show positive associations with job and marital quality. Relationships between community participation and affective <b>community</b> <b>resources</b> and job stress are partially mediated by workto-family conflict and facilitation. Family-towork conflict and facilitation partially mediate relationships between affective <b>community</b> <b>resources</b> and marital satisfaction and risk. The study takes a beginning step in establishing relationships and exploring processes that make up the work-community-family interface...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent work in {{a number}} of {{countries}} has identified growing geographical inequalities in health between deprived and non-deprived neighbourhoods. The health gaps observed cannot be entirely explained by differences in the characteristics of individuals living in those neighbourhoods, which has led to a concerted international public health research effort to determine what contextual features of neighbourhoods matter. This article reports on access to potentially health-promoting <b>community</b> <b>resources</b> across all neighbourhoods in New Zealand. Prevailing international opinion is that access to <b>community</b> <b>resources</b> is worse in deprived neighbourhoods. Methods: Geographical Information Systems were used to calculate geographical access to 16 types of <b>community</b> <b>resources</b> (including recreational amenities, and shopping, educational and health facilities) in 38 350 small census areas across the country. The distribution of these access measures by neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation was determined. Results: For 15 out of 16 measures of <b>community</b> <b>resources,</b> access was clearly better in more deprived neighbourhoods. For example, the travel time to large supermarkets was ∼ 80 % greater in the least deprived quintile of neighbourhoods compared with the most deprived quintile. Conclusions: These results challenge the widely held, but largely untested, view that areas of high social disadvantage have poorer access to <b>community</b> <b>resources.</b> Poor locational access to <b>community</b> <b>resources</b> among deprived neighbourhoods in New Zealand {{does not appear to be}} an explanation of poorer health in these neighbourhoods. If anything, a pro-equity distribution of <b>community</b> <b>resources</b> may be preventing even wider disparities in neighbourhood inequalities in health...|$|R

25|$|The {{national}} parks of England and Wales are areas of relatively undeveloped and scenic landscape that are designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act (2016). Despite their similar name, {{national parks}} in England and Wales {{are quite different}} from national parks in many other countries, which are usually owned and managed by the government as a protected <b>community</b> <b>resource,</b> and which do not usually include permanent human communities. In England and Wales, designation as a national park may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and land within a national park remains largely in private ownership.|$|E

These were the first government bodies in Australia to fund and host community IMD events. In the State Parliament of Western Australia Minister Nick Goiran gave a speech introducing International Men's Day and its objectives to the parliament, focussing on the promotion of gender equality {{and the importance of}} highlighting positive male role models. There was also an event held in the Federal Australian Parliament House with several notable speakers. Numerous other organisations hosted observations including the Men's Shed Steering Committee in Rockhampton, the <b>Community</b> <b>Resource</b> center in Ulladulla, the Regional Health Service in KooWeeRup, and Dads on the Air radio programme in Sydney which hosted an hour-long programme discussing IMD with a panel of international coordinators of the event.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{a number of}} local critics {{have argued that the}} high number of {{applications}} for CHS student slots suggested serious weaknesses at the city's traditional high schools.

The class of 2009 had the second-highest ACT scores in the state of Michigan. As one of the school's many <b>Community</b> <b>Resource</b> Program offerings, Ann Arbor-based Google AdWords developed a class for CHS students in 2007.
