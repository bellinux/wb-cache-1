5000|$|The {{purpose for}} {{in vivo testing}} is to {{determine}} the potential of DNA damage that can affect chromosomal structure or disturb the mitotic apparatus that changes chromosome number; the factors that could influence the genotoxicity are ADME and DNA repair. It can also detect genotoxic agents missed in in vitro tests. The positive result of induced chromosomal damage is an increase in frequency of micronucelated PCEs. [...] A micronucleus is a small structure separate from the nucleus containing nuclear DNA arisen from DNA fragments or whole chromosomes that were not incorporated in the daughter cell during mitosis. Causes for this structure are mitotic loss of acentric chromosomal fragments (<b>clastogenicity),</b> mechanical problems from chromosomal breakage and exchange, mitotic loss of chromosomes (aneugenicity), and apoptosis. The micronucleus test in vivo is similar to the in vitro one because it tests for structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells, especially in rats' blood cells.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{application}} of the concept of a threshold to risk assessment is widespread, there remains little experi-mental evidence for the existence of thresholds for geno-toxic compounds, other than aneugens. The <b>clastogenicity</b> of topoisomerase inhibitors is believed to result from the transient stabilization of the topoisomerase enzyme with DNA during the catalytic cycle. This leads to the forma-tion of a stabilized cleavage complex, which, in turn, may result in the formation of a DNA strand break. This indir-ect mechanism of <b>clastogenicity</b> is the basis for the concept of threshold for this class of drug. Using micronucleus induction in L 5178 Y mouse lymphoma cells as a genotoxic end-point, a three pronged approach was used to examine whether the concept of a threshold for <b>clastogenicity</b> could be demonstrated for topoisomerase type II inhibitors in vitro. This involved (i) the study of mechanism (TARDIS assay), (ii) hypothesis testing versus estimation (i. e. scoring up to 10 000 cells/treatment at concentrations immediately above and below the NOEL for micronucleus induction) and (iii) statistical modelling of the concentration±response curves for micronucleus induc-tion. Several topoisomerase type II inhibitors were investi-gated with varying clastogenic potencies (etoposide = doxorubicin < genistein < cipro¯oxacin). Pragmatic thresholds for <b>clastogenicity</b> in L 5178 Y cells were de®ned at 0. 00236 mg/ml for etoposide, 0. 00151 mg/ml for doxoru-bicin, 1 mg/ml for genistein and 50 mg/ml for cipro¯oxacin. In addition, it was demonstrated that etoposide-induced <b>clastogenicity</b> was concentration and time dependent. These results, along with mechanistic data showing that all of the compounds induced concentration-dependent increases in the formation of topoisomerase II stabilized cleavage complexes, provide a weight of evidence to sup-port a threshold concept for <b>clastogenicity</b> with topoisome-rase II poisons...|$|E

The purpose of the present work was to study the <b>clastogenicity</b> of different doses of vitamin B 6 and to examine the possible modulating effect of this vitamin on chromosomal damage induced by the antitumor agent doxorubicin in Wistar rats. Experimental groups were set up for pre-and simultaneous treatment with vitamin B 6 alone or in combination with DXR. The data obtained from administering diVerent doses of vitamin B(6) (12. 5 - 100 mg/kg b. w.) showed no signigicant increase in total chromosomal aberrations when compared with the negative control. The administration of two doses of 25 mg/kg b. w. or one dose of 50 mg/kg b. w. of vitamin B 6 before doxorubicin injection seemed equally effective in protecting cells against doxorubicin <b>clastogenicity.</b> The anticlastogenic effect of vitamin B(6) on DXR-induced chromosomal damage could be ascribed to its antioxidant properties.

40|$|The {{potential}} mutagenicity and <b>clastogenicity</b> (ability {{to cause}} chromosomal damage) of five South African traditional medicinal plants: Acokanthera oppositifolia (Lam.); Pelargonium sp. cf. inquinans (L.) L Herit; Pteridium aquilinum subsp aquilinum; Rumex lanceolatus Thunb. and Zantedeschia aethiopica (L.) Sg, were investigated using two in vitro tests in both a bacterial and a mammalian cell system. The Salmonella reverse mutation assay and chromosomal aberration test, two frequently used and accepted pharmacological bioassays, {{were selected for}} the investigation. The rat liver extract (S 9), containing CYP P 450 and other liver enzymes, {{was added to the}} in vitro cell system to detect pro-mutagens that require metabolic activation in order to exert mutagenicity or <b>clastogenicity</b> - directly acting mutagens do not require metabolic activation. A significant mutagenic potential (p 0. 01) was evident with the Salmonella reverse mutation assay for three of the aqueous plant extracts: (i) R. lanceolatus (in strains TA 97 a, TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102) with and without metabolic activation (S 9), (ii) P. aquilinum in TA 100 with S 9 and in TA 102 without S 9 and (iii) Pelargonium (in TA 102) without S 9. Furthermore, R. lanceolatus and P. aquilinum were clastogenic in the chromosomal aberration test but this effect was reduced with S 9. Z. aethiopica demonstrated <b>clastogenicity,</b> which was reduced with S 9, but the extract was not mutagenic. Since the chromosomal aberration test is dependent on cells entering the cell cycle (Go-G 1, S and G 2 -M) and chromosome visibility with light microscopy only occurs at metaphase, the <b>clastogenicity</b> of A. oppositifolia and Pelargonium could not be detected because these extracts inhibited mitosis (M). A DNA analysis of cultures treated with A. oppositifolia and Pelargonium by Flow Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) indicated a blockage in the Go/G 1 phase of the cell cycle. The in vitro mutagenicity and <b>clastogenicity</b> tests served as a preliminary investigation into the safety of five traditional plants. In addition to mutagenicity testing, it is suggested that further scientific evaluation, validation, standardisation and regulation of South African traditional medicine is essential in order to prevent the adverse acute and chronic effects of plant ingestion. ii...|$|E

The grape extracts {{and two of the}} three polyphenol-rich fractions promoted MMC-induced SCEs at concentrations from 75 to 300 mu g/mL. However, none of the extracts or fractions alone induced SCEs. Thus, these results suggest caution especially with regard to the use of grape extracts as dietary supplements. On the other hand, the fact that these extracts were not genotoxic alone may indicate a selective activity against genetically damaged cells. This is the first study regarding the clastogenic effects of grape extracts in human cells.

In CHO cells, the <b>clastogenicity</b> of MEHP was unaffected {{by the presence of}} an exogenous metabolic activation system (S- 9 mix). 2 -Ethylhexanol, o-phthalic acid, and phthalic anhydride were without effect. Cytochemical methods and assays for carnitine acetyltransferase and KCN-insensitive palmitoyl CoA oxidation were employed to determine whether chromosome damage was associated with peroxisome proliferation. No evidence of an increase in peroxisome numbers or of induction of marker enzymes was found in CHO cells treated with MEHP for up to 72 hr. Clofibric acid and BR 931 were also ineffective. Observations on changes in CHO cell structure and permeability, and on the haemolytic effects of phthalate monoesters, suggest that the cytotoxicity of MEHP may be due primarily to its action on cell membranes.

40|$|Two {{different}} types of DNA adducts are formed from many aromatic amines by bioactivation: N-acetylated and nonacetylated, arylamine DNA adducts. It has become clear from experiments using N-acetyl- 2 -aminofluorene and 2 -aminofluorene adducts to C 8 of deoxyguanosine that {{these two types of}} adducts may have different effects on DNA structure and DNA replication. We have determined blocking of DNA replication by various other N-acetylarylamine and arylamine deoxyguanosine adducts. It was found that the N-acetyl group in general is required for blocking of DNA replication; the nature of the aromatic moiety seems to be of minor importance. Little information is available on the genotoxic effects of these adducts in mammalian cells in vivo. We have tried to get more insight in this by investigating the <b>clastogenicity,</b> the initiation of preneoplastic cells, and the promotional effects of various aromatic amines from which different ratios of N-acetylarylamine DNA adducts to arylamine DNA adducts are formed in the rat liver.

40|$|The use of coal {{for fuel}} {{in place of}} {{oil and natural gas}} has been {{increasing}} in the United States. Typically, users store their reserves of coal outdoors in large piles and rainfall on the coal creates runoffs which may contain materials hazardous to the environment and the public 2 ̆ 7 s health. To study this hazard, rainfall on model coal piles was simulated, using deionized water and four coals of varying sulfur content. The simulated surface runoffs were collected during 9 rainfall simulations spaced 15 days apart. The runoffs were analyzed for 13 standard water quality parameters, extracted with organic solvents and then analyzed with capillary column GC/MS, and the extracts were tested for mutagenicity with the Ames Salmonella microsomal assay and for <b>clastogenicity</b> with Chinese hamster ovary cells. ^ The runoffs from the high-sulfur coals and the lignite exhibited extremes of pH (acidity), specific conductance, chemical oxygen demand, and total suspended solids; the low-sulfur coal runoffs did not exhibit these extremes. Without treatment, effluents from these high-sulfur coals and lignite would not comply with federal water quality guidelines. ^ Most extracts of the simulated surface runoffs contained at least 10 organic compounds including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, their methyl and ethyl homologs, olefins, paraffins, and some terpenes. The concentrations of these compounds were generally less than 50 (mu) g/l in most extracts. ^ Some of the extracts were weakly mutagenic and affected both a DNA-repair proficient and deficient Salmonella strain. The addition of S 9 decreased the effect significantly. Extracts of runoffs from the low-sulfur coal were not mutagenic. ^ All extracts were clastogenic.

Patulin has been reported to have mutagenic, carcinogenic and teratogenic properties. Nevertheless, these properties are still a matter of debate. In this report, we further investigated the genotoxicity of patulin in mammalian cells by two different approaches. Firstly, we evaluated the induction of micronuclei in cytokinesis-blocked human lymphocytes. This approach is important because available data concerning the genetic toxicity of patulin in human cells is sparse. Secondly, we chose an established model for patulin genotoxicity, i. e. the chromosomal aberration assay in V 79 Chinese hamster cells, to clarify whether concomitant exposure to ascorbic acid with the mycotoxin modulates or not the <b>clastogenicity</b> of patulin.

A major concern is how exposure to combinations of low levels of pesticides, especially herbicides, could affect public health. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine the clastogenic potential of herbicide interaction on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The cells were exposed to atrazine, simazine, cyanazine, and all possible combinations of these chemicals for 48 hr. Two concentrations were used for each sample: the U. S.

One station in a nonurban river was included (REF). The concentrations of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined by HPLC, and the genotoxicity of the sediments was monitored by the Salmonella mutagenicity test (TA 98 + S 9, YG 1041 ± S 9), the comet assay, and the micronucleus assay on CHO cells. Chemical analysis showed that the total PAH concentrations ranged from 23 μg kg− 1 dw (REF) to 1285 μg kg− 1 dw (StD). All the sediments were mutagenic in the Salmonella mutagenicity test. The mutagenicity was probably induced by the presence of nitroarenes (StA, StB, StC, and StD) and aromatic amines (REF) as deduced from the mutagenicity profiles of strains YG 1041 ± S 9 and TA 98 + S 9.

The clastogenic effects induced by MMC and BL were significantly reduced (- 33 %) whereas with H 2 O 2 the protective effect of plicatin B was observed (- 62 %) only at the greater H 2 O 2 dose. The anticlastogen effects of plicatin B were effective when the chalcone was introduced in the culture, 1 h before the reference clastogens...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Baccharis dracunculifolia De Candole (DC) (Asterace-ae) is {{indigenous}} throughout southeastern Latin America {{and is used}} {{by local}} people in traditional medicine. This plant {{is known to be}} the source of resin for the highly valued Brazilian green propolis. As no information is available on the safety of high doses of B. dracunculifo-lia extract, we evaluated the mutagenic potential of high doses of this plant extract in vivo on peripheral blood cells of Swiss mice using the comet assay and the micronucleus test. The extract was administered by gavage at doses of 1000, 1500 and 2000 mg/kg body weight. Peripheral blood cell samples were collected 4 and 24 h after treatment for the comet assay (genotoxicity assay), and at 48 and 72 h for the micro-nucleus test (<b>clastogenicity</b> assay). The B. dracunculifolia extract was devoid of clastogenic/genotoxic activity at all doses...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{exposure}} to propylene does {{not result in}} any increased incidence of tumors, yet does increase N 7 -hydroxypropylguanine (N 7 -HPGua) adducts in tissue DNA. To investigate any potential for genotoxicity (mutagenicity or <b>clastogenicity),</b> male F 344 rats were exposed via inhalation to up to 10, 000 ppm propylene for 1, 3, or 20 days (6 h/day, 5 days/week). The endpoints examined included gene (Hprt, splenocytes) and chromosomal (bone marrow micronucleus [MN]) mutations, hemoglobin (hydroxypropylva-line, HPVal) adducts in systemic blood, and DNA adducts (N 7 -HPGua) in several tissues. Similarly exposed female and male F 344 rats, implanted with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) minipumps, were evaluated for nasal effects (irritation via histopathology and cell proliferation via BrdU). Internal dose measures provided clear evidence for propylene exposure, with HPVal increased for all exposures; N 7 -HPGua was increased in all tissues from rat...|$|E
40|$|Aniline {{has been}} {{reported}} to be positive in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. This finding is inconsistent with its lack of carcinogenicity in this species. Micronuclei can arise by mechanisms that do not involve direct interaction with DNA, e. g. induction of aneuploidy or stimulation of erythropoiesis. However, clastogenic materials would be expected to demonstrate an increased level of chromosomal damage in dividing precursor erythroblasts. In the present study we have investigated the ability of aniline HCl to induce chromosome aberrations in bone marrow metaphase cells. No evidence of <b>clastogenicity</b> was observed in this study. This suggests that the activity seen in earlier micro-nucleus assays may have arisen by a mechanism not involving direct DNA interaction. Aniline is known to be toxic towards the erythropoietic system and the possibility exists that micronuclei may be produced {{as a result of this}} toxicity...|$|E
40|$|The kinetochore-containing {{micronuclei}} induced in CHO cells by clastogenic and aneuploidogenic substances, such as mitomycin C (MMC) or colchicine, were {{distinguished by}} means of a technique based on the use of human CREST antikinetochore antibodies. Both substances induced their expected effects. However, 48 hours after the end of treatment, colchicine and MMC induced a significant increase of CREST- and CREST+ micronuclei, respectively, suggesting an induction of <b>clastogenicity</b> by colchicine and of aneuploidy by MMC. These results were confirmed by the characterisation of the micronuclei induced by the same substances in gill cells of the marine mussel, Mytilus, treated in vivo. A cytofluorimetric analysis on the isolated gill of this animal showed that the cell cycle remained unaltered until almost 24 hours after excision. This suggests the possibility of using the isolated gill of Mytilus as a new biological system for laboratory experiments...|$|E
30|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the mutagenic potential of PHEA-C 16 -iron oxide in terms of <b>clastogenicity</b> using cultured Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells in the presence (+S) and absence (−S) of metabolic activation system. The metabolic activation system was prepared with Aroclor 1254 -induced rat liver homogenate and cofactor. The PHEA-C 16 -iron oxide was suspended in complete culture medium (minimum essential medium), and serial dilutions were made for treatment. The highest dose for each treatment series was determined based on the relative cell count (RCC) as a cytotoxicity index. The doses are 138, 275, 550, and 600 μg/ml (6 h); 10, 20, 40, and 50 μg/ml (6 h); and 10, 20, 30, 40 μg/ml (24 h) with appropriate negative and positive controls to evaluate the mutagenic potential of PHEA-C 16 -iron oxide in presence (+S), absence (−S), and absence (−S) of metabolic activation system, respectively.|$|E
30|$|Irvingia gabonensis (Irvingiaceae) locally {{known as}} “bush mango or African mango” since the trees bear fruits {{that look like}} small mango (Matos et al., 2010). In Senegal, the {{decoction}} of the stem bark {{is used in the}} treatment of gonorrhoea, hepatic and gastrointestinal disorders [99]. The thanol extract of the leaves of this plant has been investigated for its hepatoprotective activity in sodium arsenite (SA) induced hepatotoxicity and <b>clastogenicity</b> in male Wistar rats [100]. The extract at 250 or 500  mg/kg dose dependently attenuated sodium arsenite induced rise in liver enzymes including AST, ALT and and gamma glutamyltransferase (γGT) and prevented histopathological alterations in the liver [100]. Phytochemical studies on the ethanol extract of Irvingia gabonensis showed the presence of of tannins, saponins, alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids and phenols [100]. Tannins have been reported to have anti-inflammatory and antiulcer property in rodents and they also exhibit strong antioxidant properties [101].|$|E
