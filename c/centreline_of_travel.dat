40|$|Road grip {{on roads}} depend on many factors and {{different}} techniques {{are available to}} estimate available road grip. To ensure that entrepreneurs have successfully restored the road grip to an acceptable level both entrepreneurs and road keepers need tools to evaluate present road grip. Information about road grip {{can also be utilized}} directly in a vehicle if available, for systems such as ABS, traction control, etc. To evaluate a non-contact method based on three laser beams with different frequency this equipment was mounted on a car equipped with a fifth wheel behind the car. The wheel is angled about 1. 5 degrees compared with the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel.</b> A force sensor in the hub measures forces acting on a standard winter tire also mounted to the hub, this is considered to be one measurement of road grip. The main reason is to see how well one can estimate road grip with a low cost non contact device made with Laser beams in combination with a photodiode.

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{distributions}} of noise level maxima, LAFmax, generated during the pass-by of over 85 000 vehicles in service on urban arterials and motorways. These were measured under normal traffic and vehicle operating conditions on multilane roadways. They {{are indicative of}} the instantaneous maximum noise levels that would be experienced in the free field at the set-back distance of the facades of the first row of many dwellings fronting urban roadways in Australia, from vehicles travelling in the nearside lane. Noise levels are reported separately for four classes of vehicle and for roadways with five different posted speed limits. Results have been standardised as free-field levels 15 m from the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> vehicle <b>travel.</b> The data were collected in Brisbane but can be assumed to be representative of noise level maxima from vehicles operating throughout Australia. Maximum noise levels increase with vehicle class (from cars through to articulated trucks) and with roadway speed limits. The within-vehicle-class variance is large and the distributions of maxima from different vehicle classes overlap extensively. Sound Power Levels of the observed vehicles agree well with those from the European IMAGINE emission model. This investigation contributes essential information regarding the source and levels of noise events adjacent to urban road networks - the likely determinant of human sleep disturbance.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of three-dimensional (3 D) object information from biplane CT angiographic images {{is still a}} challenge in application of modelling coronary vessel trees.

Those 2 D feature points are on the <b>centrelines</b> <b>of</b> vessels. This research also includes how to extract the interested coronary vessels from CT angiographic images and how to represent those vessels {{as a group of}} connected 2 D points that are on <b>centrelines</b> <b>of</b> them. One of the contributions in the paper is that we developed automatic searching algorithm to obtain the 2 D corresponding points from a pair of biplane skeleton images under the two constraints of epipolar lines and corresponding bifurcations. We apply the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm to register the corresponding bifurcations from an image sequence for the application of the proposed searching algorithm. The 3 D reconstruction applies the readings of rotated mechanical angles and isocentre of the CT angiographic machine (Siemens Axiom) to establish the biplane image relationships of rotation and translation, and then projects the 2 D <b>centrelines</b> <b>of</b> coronary vessels onto 3 D world coordinates. Another contribution of the paper is that we apply the back projection algorithm to project the 3 D points onto 2 D image planes for evaluating the accuracy of the 3 D reconstruction. The proposed method has been tested on patient data. Key Words: 3 D reconstruction, biplane angiographic image, coronary vessel. ...|$|R

40|$|In South Africa, timber-trussed roofs {{supporting}} concrete tiles {{have for}} many years often been braced solely by means of diagonal braces. Failures {{have shown that the}} diagonal brace was inadequate for larger span roofs, and the use of diagonal bracing has subsequently been limited to spans of less or equal to 10 m. When designing the compression chords of a timber truss in a braced roof, SANS 10163 : 1 (2003) recommends a minimum effective length for out-of-plane buckling of not less than 15 x b, which is 540 mm for a 36 mm wide member. This effective or out-of-plane buckling length of the top chord was later assumed to be equal to the spacing of the trusses. With the availability of PC-based packages that are able to perform three-dimensional buckling analyses, it is perhaps useful to investigate the validity of using the effective length equal to the truss spacing, and then also the 10 m limit on span for roofs braced by means of diagonal braces. A common error made when analysing three-dimensional buckling problems is to assume connectivity on the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> the members, thereby neglecting eccentricity between the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> the bracing and the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> the member being braced (see Figure 1). In timber-trussed roofs, the diagonal brace is nailed to the underside of the top chord of a number of adjacent trusses. The brace runs at more or less 45 ° and triangulation appears to be complete when viewed on plan, as the battens form the other elements of the bracing system triangulation. Trusses some distance from the trusses that are connected to the diagonal brace can, however, only obtain lateral support via the battens that are connected {{to the top of the}} compression chords. The authors feel that a more correct way of analysing a timber-trussed roof, braced by means of a diagonal brace, requires that the eccentricity between the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> the battens on top of the compression chords and the <b>centreline</b> <b>of</b> the braced points on the underside of the compression chords be taken into account. Furthermore, the connections between the battens and the top chord are not infinitely stiff and this stiffness, together with the low torsional rigidity of the timber members, should be taken into account in the buckling analysis. The analysis can be further improved by taking the out-of-plane bending stiffness of the web members into account. All these factors will influence the buckling length of the compression chords to some degree. In this paper, the authors show how incorrect assumptions may mislead the designer into believing that the buckling length is equal to or less than the spacing of the trusses. They also show that, even though the bracing members have been placed on the correct sides of the top chord in the analysis, incorrect assumptions about the torsional stiffness of the top chords can lead to buckling lengths that are slightly less than when a more realistic torsional stiffness is used...|$|R
