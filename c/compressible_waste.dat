40|$|The {{collapse}} of building {{in most cases}} is associated with loss of life and properties. The incessant failures of building nowadays are so enormous {{that it has become}} a serious concern to the professionals in the building industry, clients, governments, and the general public. Most of the times, the architect and engineer who are directly involved in the construction of such building are held responsible for building failures while the geologist’s input is neglected. The frequent {{collapse of}} some buildings in major cities in Nigeria can be attributed to absence of a geotechnical report on the project site before, during and after the construction exercise. Studies have shown that geotechnical investigation report of a four storey residential building covering 420 m 2 at No. 56 Bola Street, Ebute-Metta, Lagos, that collapsed on 26 th July, 2006 was {{as a result of the}} existence of reddish brown silty clayey material and <b>compressible</b> <b>waste</b> material like wood, plastic and nylon occurring from ground surface to about 11 m on which a shallow strip foundation was used. More so, on 1 st July, 2006, another 3 - Storey building collapsed along Bank road, Port-Harcourt. The result of the liquid limit, plasticity index, shrinkage potential, moisture content, tri-axial stress range and coefficient of consolidation carried out on the two locations indicates that the soil have low bearing capacity. The collapsed of these buildings were attributed to under design, improper supervision, poor quality construction, poor funding, use of sub-standard construction materials and absence o...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Geosynthetics International [ICE Publishing / © Thomas Telford Ltd. ]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] modelling techniques can be used to examine the serviceability limit states of landfill side-slope lining systems in response to waste placement. A study has been conducted in which the variability of significant model input parameters have been investigated within a probabilistic framework using Monte Carlo simulation. Key model parameters are treated as random variables, and the statistical information required to describe their distributions has been derived from a laboratory repeatability testing programme, a literature survey and an expert consultation process. Model outputs include relative shear displacements between lining components, and tensile strains in the geosynthetic layers that occur in response to staged placement of waste against the side slope. It was found that analyses including input parameter variability were able to identify mechanisms influencing liner performance and their probability of occurrence. These mechanisms include large (i. e. ≫ 100 mm) relative displacements at interfaces that can generate post-peak strengths, and mobilised tensile strains in the geomembrane and geotextile layers. Additionally, it was found that relative displacements at the controlling (i. e. weakest) liner interface are greater for landfills with a steep side slope, for stiffer waste and thicker waste lifts, while tensile strains in the geosynthetic elements are greater for steep side slopes, more <b>compressible</b> <b>waste</b> and thinner waste lifts. Outputs from probabilistic analyses such as that used in this study can guide engineers regarding geometries and materials that could produce waste-settlement-generated serviceability limit state failures, and hence can be used to support more reliable designs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A <b>compressible</b> nuclear <b>waste</b> {{disposal}} {{contamination in}} porous media is modeled by a coupled system of partial differential equations. The approximation {{of this system}} using a finite element method for the brine, radionuclides, and heat combined with a mixed finite element method for the pressure and velocity are analyzed. Optimal order error estimates in H 1 and L 2 are derived. This paper improves upon previously derived estimates in two aspects. Firstly, the error analysis is given with no restriction on the diffusion tensors. That is, we have included the effects of molecular diffusion and dispersion. Secondly, the &quot;complete compressibility &quot; case is considered. 1 Introduction This paper describes and analyzes a mixed finite element method applied {{to a set of}} partial differential equations representing certain compressible flow by which the radionuclides from the nuclear waste are transported. The governing equations are [13, 16]...|$|R
40|$|It {{has become}} common {{practice}} to conduct numerical analyses {{to assess the}} stability and integrity of side slope landfill lining systems; however, {{information that can be}} used to validate such models is extremely limited. This paper contains data from a series of large-scale laboratory tests containing geosynthetic elements of a multilayered lining system exposed to downdrag forces from a <b>compressible</b> synthetic <b>waste</b> material (rubber crumb). These data are compared to the results from numerical analysis of the same problem. The numerical results are from initial best estimate analyses, with interface and synthetic waste properties derived from a laboratory testing programme and geosynthetic material properties from manufacturers. The observed trends of tensile stresses in the geosynthetics and relative displacements at interfaces in the laboratory testing are reproduced by the numerical models to an acceptable degree of accuracy that would be appropriate, using site-specific input data, for use in commercial design. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
