50|$|In 2001, {{as the old}} {{paint job}} could hardly be distinguished, {{residents}} who lived within 35 mi of the <b>capital</b> <b>voted</b> on a new color scheme. Their choices were all-gold; green, gold and silver; or burgundy, silver and gold. The winning choice was all gold, and it was repainted in 2002. However, that did not lessen the bridge's color controversy. Some people complained that the new paint was not as gilded as advertised. Others have suggested that copper {{would have been a}} far better color choice, especially in the context of nearby buildings. The new coat is expected to last 30 years.|$|R

40|$|Using {{ownership}} and control data for 890 firm-years, {{this article examines}} the concentration of <b>capital</b> and <b>voting</b> rights in British companies {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century. We find that both <b>capital</b> and <b>voting</b> rights were diffuse by modern-day standards. However, this does not necessarily mean that there was a modern-style separation of ownership from control in Victorian Britain. One major implication of our findings is that diffuse ownership was present in the UK much earlier than previously thought, and given that it occurred in an era with weak shareholder protection law, it somewhat undermines the influential law and finance hypothesis. We also find that diffuse ownership is correlated with large boards, a London head office, non-linear voting rights, and shares traded on multiple markets...|$|R
50|$|In December 2011, Icade {{announced}} plans to develop closer ties with Silic, a leading French owner of rental property on business parks. The operation was authorised by France's competition watchdog on 13 February 2012, enabling Caisse des Dépôts to acquire a majority stake in Silic through a listed {{real estate investment trust}} called HoldCo 16. This holding company, owned by Caisse des Dépôts (75.07% of the <b>capital</b> and <b>voting</b> rights) and Groupama (24.93%), has a 43.95% interest in Silic's <b>capital</b> and corresponding <b>voting</b> rights. The securities exchange takeover bid submitted by Icade in March 2012 was approved by France's finance market authority (AMF) in April 201217. However, SMA Vie BTP and ADAM, an association that defends the interests of minority shareholders, appealed against this bid in May 2012. The Paris appeal court is expected to deliver its verdict by mid-2013. This business combination would create an asset portfolio worth 9 billion euros, approximately 80% of which would be commercial and office property. Together, Silic's business parks and Icade's Portes de Paris properties will leverage the potential of two million square metres.Icade has held 93.28% of the share <b>capital</b> and <b>voting</b> rights of Silic since August 2013.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the association between the ownership and control structure, level of corporate governance and origin of capital (foreign or domestic) of Brazilian companies on their propensity to smooth income. Using a sample of nonancialrms with shares traded on the São Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) {{at the end of}} 2007, we performed covariance analysis based on data from the preceding ten years, where the dependent variable was the index proposed by Eckel, an empirical proxy for smoothing. The results indicate that the more concentrated the shareholding and control structures of Brazilianrms are, both according to overall <b>capital</b> and <b>voting</b> <b>capital,</b> the more intensely they tend to smooth earnings to favor the interests of the majority shareholder. The results also show that this effect is less pronounced forrms with enhanced corporate governance levels and those with foreign capital...|$|R

40|$|Countries in the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) {{vary widely}} in their ratio of capital tax rates to labor tax rates. This paper’s {{motivation}} is the strong {{negative correlation between}} the capital/labor tax ratio and old dependency ratio (de…ned as the ratio of population older than 65 years old to population between 20 and 65 years old) among 21 OECD countries. I study a parsimonious overlapping generations (OLG) majority voting model. In equilibrium, the retired households and relatively old working households hold {{a large amount of}} <b>capital</b> and <b>vote</b> for a low capital tax rate (implying a high labor tax rate), while relatively young working households hold a small amount of <b>capital</b> and <b>vote</b> for a high capital tax rate (implying a low labor tax rate). As a result, the model implies that countries with more old people have relatively lower capital taxes. The model takes the old dependency ratio as given and delivers a capital/labor tax ratio chosen by the median voter. The calibrated model presented here can generate not only this negative correlation, but also the tax ratios for the 21 OECD countries studied...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the structure of}} ownership and control of public Brazilian companies using data from 325 companies listed at the São Paulo Stock Exchange. We show {{a high degree of}} ownership concentration. The major shareholder has, on average, 41 percent of the equity capital, while the five major have 61 percent. Concentration occurs mainly with voting shares with 62 percent of the companies having one shareholder with more than 50 percent of the voting shares. Actually, the violation of the one share-one vote rule with the use of non-voting shares is very common. Only 11 percent of the companies do not have non voting shares and the companies have, on average, only 54 percent of their equity <b>capital</b> as <b>voting</b> <b>capital.</b> We also analyze the indirect ownership structure. Pyramiding structure is not commonly used as a way of violating the one share - one vote rule. Control is maintained through more than one tier. We also show the importance of different shareholder classes. Corporations are the main investor category in the direct ownership structure while individuals are more important when indirect control is accounted for.
