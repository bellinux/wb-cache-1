Results presented in this paperwere obtained using the last 620 version of the algorithm. The correlation between the new vegetation optical depth (VOD) product and the height of the forest estimated by ICES at GLAS lidar on a global scale is investigated. Over South American and African forests a good correspondence between the two variables is observed, with saturation occurring above about 30 m height. Moreover, the comparison between the VOD and the height of the forest shows good spatial and temporal stability, and the r 2 correlation coefficient is within a 0. 59 – 0. 69 range. Conversely, discrepancies are observed in some Indonesian islands, particularly New Guinea. Over specific areas, the trends vs. forest height obtained with SMOS VOD are compared with the corresponding trends of AMSR-E VOD. Results are also validated at country-level scale. To this aim, accurate estimates of forest biomass derived from airborne lidar over selected forests of Peru, Columbia and Panama are used. Finally, the soil moisture retrieved over forests is investigated, reporting <b>continental</b> <b>maps</b> for Tropical areas and comparisons with ground measurements in selected forests of the US. <b>Continental</b> <b>maps</b> obtained with the new level 2 V 620 algorithm cover almost all forest areas, and show seasonal variations which are dependent on climatic zones.

40|$|Spatial {{diversity}} {{patterns are}} thought to be driven by climate-mediated processes. However, temporal patterns of community composition remain poorly studied. We provide two complementary analyses of North American mammal diversity, using (i) a paleontological dataset (2077 localities with 2493 taxon occurrences) spanning 21 discrete subdivisions of the Cenozoic based on North American Land Mammal Ages (36 Ma – present), and (ii) climate space model predictions for 744 extant mammals under eight scenarios of future climate change. Spatial variation in fossil mammal community structure (b diversity) is highest at intermediate values of continental mean annual precipitation (MAP) estimated from paleosols (, 450 mm/year) and declines under both wetter and drier conditions, reflecting diversity patterns of modern mammals. Latitudinal gradients in community change (latitudinal turnover gradients, aka LTGs) increase in strength through the Cenozoic, but also show a cyclical pattern that is significantly explained by MAP. In general, LTGs are weakest when <b>continental</b> <b>MAP</b> is highest, similar to modern tropical ecosystems in which latitudinal diversity gradients are weak or undetectable. Projections under modeled climate change show no substantial change in b diversity or LTG strength for North American mammals.

40|$|Land cover plays a {{key role}} in global to {{regional}} monitoring and modeling because it affects and is being affected by climate change and thus became one of the essential variables for climate change studies. National and international organizations require timely and accurate land cover information for reporting and management actions. The North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS) is an international cooperation of organizations and entities of Canada, the United States, and Mexico to map land cover change of North America's changing environment. This paper presents the methodology to derive the land cover map of Mexico for the year 2005 which was integrated in the NALCMS <b>continental</b> <b>map.</b> Based on a time series of 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and an extensive sample data base the complexity of the Mexican landscape required a specific approach to reflect land cover heterogeneity. To estimate the proportion of each land cover class for every pixel several decision tree classifications were combined to obtain class membership maps which were finally converted to a discrete map accompanied by a confidence estimate. The map yielded an overall accuracy of 82. 5 % (Kappa of 0. 79) for pixels with at least 50 % map confidence (71. 3 % of the data). An additional assessment with 780 randomly stratified samples and primary and alternative calls in the reference data to account for ambiguity indicated 83. 4 % overall accuracy (Kappa of 0. 80).

40|$|Human {{activities}} in tropical rainforests cause disturbances and degradation by {{opening up the}} forest canopy. Capacities for measuring {{the extent of the}} damage are essential to the calculation of carbon emissions under REDD+ programmes (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). Remote sensing is a powerful tool to provide this type of information (e. g. on logging, mining or infrastructure projects). Various techniques have been used to identify and quantify canopy opening. A further step is to cross-reference past and present canopy opening in order to document the recovery of ecosystems after logging. The method proposed in this article involves a semi-automatic processing chain adapted for LANDSAT imagery. During post-processing, canopy opening information is extracted by means of specific algorithms. A spatial index, calibrated to a low-resolution radiometer, indicates present and past degrees of opening. This process produces estimations of forest degradation that can describe lowresolution remotely-sensed data (such as MODIS) used in <b>continental</b> <b>mapping.</b> These estimations are then cross-referenced with <b>continental</b> land cover <b>maps</b> to gain insights into present-day forest categories. This tool was developed under the CoForChange project, whose overall objective is to predict changes in forests and in tree species distribution in the Congo Basin as a result of global change, and to develop decision-making tools.

40|$|Bush {{encroachment}} (BE) {{describes a}} global problem severely affecting savanna ecosystems in Africa. Invasive species and woody vegetation spread out in areas where they are not naturally occurring and suppress endemic vegetation, mainly grasses. Livestock is directly affected by decreasing grasslands and inedible invasive species which {{are a result of}} the process of BE. For many small scale farmers in developing countries livestock represents a type of insurance particular in times of crop failure and droughts. Among that, BE is also becoming an increasing problem for crop production. Studies on the mapping of BE have so far only focused on smaller regions using high-resolution data and aerial photography. But they rarely provide information that goes beyond the local or national level. In our project, we aimed at a continental-wide assessment of BE. For this, we developed a process chain using a multi-scale approach to detect woody vegetation for the African continent. The resulted map was calibrated with field data provided by field surveys and experts in Southern and Eastern Africa. Supervised classification linked field data of woody vegetation, known as BE, to the respective pixel of multi-scale remote sensing data. The regression technique was based on random forests, a machine learning classification and regression approach programmed in R. Hotpots of woody vegetation were further overlaid with significant increasing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trends which can refer to BE. Secondly, the probability of BE occurrence based on possible identified causes such as fire occurrence, mean annual precipitation rates, soil moisture, cattle density and CO 2 emissions was analyzed. By this, possible areas for BE occurrence based on their pre-conditions and risk factors were identified. This approach includes multiple datasets derived from earth observation data to detect BE - a severe and ongoing global problem - at the continental level. Within the study's duration of seven months, a method to upscale field data to a larger level could be developed. Nevertheless, improvement is needed to provide a reliable <b>continental</b> <b>map</b> on BE. Especially the integration of more field data will be needed which is currently under consideration. The identification of woody vegetation and the probability of its occurrence can help to prevent further ecosystem degradation.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to propose a new {{classification}} of African ecosystems based on an 8 -year analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets from SPOT/VEGETATION. We develop two methods of classification. The first method is obtained from a k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) classifier, which represents a simple machine learning algorithm in pattern recognition. The second method is hybrid in that it combines k- NN clustering, hierarchical principles and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The nomenclature of the two classifications relies on three levels of vegetation structural categories based on the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). The two main outcomes are: (i) The delineation of the spatial distribution of ecosystems into five bioclimatic ecoregions at the African continental scale; (ii) Two ecosystem maps were made sequentially: an initial map with 92 ecosystems from the k-NN, plus a deduced hybrid classification with 73 classes, which better reflects the bio-geographical patterns. The inclusion of bioclimatic information and successive k-NN clustering elements helps to enhance the discrimination of ecosystems. Adopting this hybrid approach makes the ecosystem identification and labelling more flexible and more accurate in comparison to straightforward methods of classification. The validation of the hybrid classification, conducted by crossing-comparisons with validated <b>continental</b> <b>maps,</b> displayed a mapping accuracy of 54...|$|R

A major limitation of the MODIS VCF product is that the vegetation layers do not directly correspond to the percent woody and percent herbaceous cover layers that are needed to accurately derive C 3 /C 4 composition of vegetation cover. To address this issue, we develop a rules-based algorithm to separate shrubs and true herbaceous cover from the MODIS herbaceous (i. e., non-tree vegetation) layer using the Global Land Cover 2000 dataset for South America.
