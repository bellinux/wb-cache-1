60|$|My <b>cash-book</b> being cast up for {{the last}} month, I find, by {{the foot of the}} leaf, there is cash {{remaining}} in hand to balance Â£176, 10s. 6d.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} left now but to examine the <b>cash-book,</b> for form's sake. The money had been paid in notes, the amounts and numbers of which exactly tallied with the figures set down in my list.|$|E
6000|$|Acting {{on these}} convictions, it is said, {{he joined the}} firm of Allfrey and Graddy, and, making over his <b>cash-books</b> and ledgers to the [...] "rising generation," [...] fairly and finally, like his new partners, renounced his ancient habit of digging for gold.|$|R
60|$|Noon is the {{universal}} dinner-hour throughout the gold-mines, an hour {{which might be}} adopted with profit in every way, we venture to suggest, by those who dig for gold in commercial and legal ledgers and <b>cash-books</b> in more civilised lands. When the new-comers reached a moderately-sized log-cabin, which was the chief hotel of the colony, they found it in all the bustle of preparation for an immediate and simple, though substantial, meal.|$|R
60|$|Need we say, reader, that {{he insisted}} on sharing it with Joe Graddy, without whose prompt and {{vigorous}} aid the rescue of Bradling {{could not have been}} effected? and need we add that the two friends found their way to the sea-coast as quickly as possible, and set sail for England without delay? We think not. But it may be as well to state that, on his arrival in England, Frank found his old uncle in a very sour condition of mind indeed, having become more bilious and irascible than ever over his <b>cash-books</b> and ledgers,--his own special diggings--without having added materially to his gold.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid, Joseph, that I {{have not}} taken note of that in my extract-- your dear father {{used to call the}} thing he did with his <b>cash-book</b> {{at the end of the}} year an extract--I think I've omitted that." ...|$|E
6000|$|The clerk {{opened the}} money-drawer under the counter; counted the pounds, shillings and pence paid by chance {{customers}} {{up to the}} closing of the shop on the previous evening; compared the result with the petty <b>cash-book,</b> and answered, [...] "Right to a halfpenny." ...|$|E
60|$|The room got colder, but Bob {{had made}} some entries in a <b>cash-book</b> she could not understand, and opening the book again, she {{spent some time in}} {{calculations}} that threw no fresh light on the matter. Then she heard steps and turned as Charnock came in.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She's steward, and agent, and everything. She {{has got a}} room called [...] "my lady's office," [...] {{and great}} ledgers and <b>cash-books</b> you never see the like. In old times there were bailiffs {{to look after the}} workfolk, foremen to look after the tradesmen, a building-steward to look after the foremen, a land-steward to look after the building-steward, and a dashing grand agent to look after the land-steward: fine times they had then, I assure ye. My lady said they were eating out the {{property}} like a honeycomb, {{and then there was a}} terrible row. Half of 'em were sent flying; and now there's only the agent, and the viscountess, and a sort of surveyor man, and of the three she does most work so 'tis said. She marks the trees to be felled, settles what horses are to be sold and bought, and is out in all winds and weathers. There, if somebody hadn't looked into things 'twould soon have been all up with his lordship, he was so very extravagant. In one sense 'twas lucky for him that she was born in humble life, because owing to it she knows the ins and outs of contriving, which he never did.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Bitterly did he now feel, poor fellow, {{that this}} course, {{although}} somewhat pleasing at the time, {{did not fit}} him to use and enjoy the more advanced period of life. He had disliked and refused to sit still even for an hour {{at a time in}} boyhood; it now began to dawn upon him that he was doomed for life to the greatest of all his horrors, the top of a three-legged stool! He had hated writing and figures, and now visions of ledgers, <b>cash-books,</b> invoice-books and similar literature with endless arithmetical calculations began to float before his mental vision. With intense regret he reflected that if he had only used reasonably well the brief period of life which as yet lay behind him, he might by that time have been done with initial drudgery and have been entering on a brilliant career in one of the learned professions. As to the army and navy, he was too old to get into either, even if he had possessed interest, which he did not. Sternly did he reproach his departed uncle when he brooded over his wrongs, and soliloquised thus:--"You ought to have known that I was a fool, that I could not be expected to know the fact, or to guide myself aright in opposition to and despite of my own folly, and you ought to have forced me to study when I declined to be led--bah! it's too late to say all this now. Come, if there is any manhood in me worthy of the name, let me set to work at once and make the most of what is left to me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{the more}} he looked, the less he saw of a {{favourable}} nature. Some of his evil practices also had of late begun to shed their legitimate fruit on John Webster, and to teach him something {{of the meaning of}} those words, [...] "Be sure your sins shall find you out." [...] This complicated matters considerably. He consulted his <b>cash-books,</b> bank-books, bill-books, sales-books, order-books, ledgers, etcetera, etcetera, again and again, for hours at a time, without arriving at any satisfactory result. He went to his diminutive office early in the morning, and sat there late at night; and did not, by so doing, improve his finances a whit, although he succeeded in materially injuring his health. He worried the life of poor meek Grinder {{to such an extent that}} that unfortunate man went home one night and told his wife he meant to commit suicide, begged her to go out and purchase a quart of laudanum for that purpose at the fishmonger's, and was not finally induced to give up, or at least to delay, his rash purpose, until he had swallowed a tumbler of mulled port wine and gone to sleep with a bottle of hot water at his feet! In short, Mr Webster did all that it was possible for a man to do in order to retrieve his fortunes--all except pray, and commit his affairs into the hands of his Maker; that he held to be utterly ridiculous. To make use of God's winds, and waves, and natural laws, and the physical and mental powers which had been given him, for the furtherance of his designs, was quite natural, he said; but to make use of God's word and His promises--tut! tut! he said, that was foolishness.|$|R
60|$|Away {{goes the}} {{tradesman}} to his books, which he pretends he keeps so exact, and examining them over again, {{he finds the}} bill for thirty pounds entered fairly, but in his running the whole year over together, as well he might, he had overlooked it, whereas, if his <b>cash-book</b> had been duly posted every week, as it ought to have been, this bill had been regularly placed to account.|$|E
6000|$|If {{there appears}} to be more money in the cash than there is by the balance in the <b>cash-book,</b> this must follow--namely, that some parcel of money must have been received, which is not entered in the book; now, till the {{tradesman}} knows what sum of money this is, that is thus not entered, how can he tell but the mistake may be quite the other way, and the cash be really wrong to his loss? Thus, ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{keeping a}} <b>cash-book</b> {{is one of}} the nicest parts of a tradesman's business, because there is always the bag and the book to be brought together, and if they do not exactly speak the same language, even to a farthing, there must be some {{omission}}; and how big or how little that omission may be, who knows, or how shall it be known, but by casting and recasting up, telling, and telling over and over again, the money? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Drawing from nature," [...] cried Mr Allfrey {{with a look}} {{of supreme}} contempt, [...] "what do I care for nature? What have you to do with nature in this nineteenth century? Nature, sir, is only fit for savages. There is nothing natural now-a-days. Why, what do you suppose would become of my ledger and <b>cash-book,</b> my office and business, if I and my clerks raved about nature as you do? A fig for nature!--the less you study it the better. I never do." ...|$|E
60|$|What I call {{balancing}} his <b>cash-book,</b> is, first, {{the casting}} up daily, or weekly, or monthly, his receipts and payments, and then seeing what money {{is left in}} hand, or, as the usual expression of the tradesman is, what money is in cash; secondly, the examining his money, telling it over, and seeing how much he has in his chest or bags, and then seeing if it agrees with the balance of his book, that what is, and what should be, correspond.|$|E
60|$|It happens {{some years}} after that this city {{tradesman}} dies, and his executors finding his accounts difficult to make up, there being no books to be found but a day-book and a <b>cash-book,</b> they get some skilful book-keeper to look into them, who immediately sees {{that the only way}} to bring the accounts to a head, is to form a ledger out of the other two, and post every body's account into it from the beginning; for though it were a long way back, there is no other remedy.|$|E
60|$|The like misfortune {{attends the}} not {{balancing}} his cash, a thing which such book-keepers as Mr G. {{do not think}} worth their trouble; nor do they understand the benefit of it. The particulars, indeed, of this article are tedious, and would be too long for a chapter; but certainly they that know any thing {{of the use of}} keeping an exact <b>cash-book,</b> know that, without it, a tradesman can never be thoroughly satisfied either of his own not committing mistakes, or of any people cheating him, I mean servants, or sons, or whoever is the first about him.|$|E
60|$|So saying, he went out, leaving Mr Black {{standing}} at the door in stupid amazement and his dirty clerk agonising with suppressed laughter behind his desk. Mr Black had been groaning and growling all the day at the thoughts of the ruin which had overtaken him--thoughts which were embittered by the knowledge that he had drawn it on himself through the instrumentality of Mrs Niven. The climax of Mr Jack's visit did not tend to restore him. Recovering from his amazement, and observing the condition of the clerk, he suddenly hurled the <b>cash-book</b> at him. Cleverly dodging it, the dirty little creature bolted from the office, and banged the door behind him.|$|E
60|$|I knew, indeed, {{a strong}} waterman, who drove a very {{considerable}} trade, but, being an illiterate tradesman, never balanced his <b>cash-book</b> for many years, nor scarce posted his other books, and, indeed, hardly understood {{how to do}} it; but knowing his trade was exceedingly profitable, and keeping his money all himself, he was easy, and grew rich apace, {{in spite of the}} most unjustifiable, and, indeed, the most intolerable, negligence; but lest this should be pleaded as an exception to my general rule, and to invalidate the argument, give me leave to add, that, though this man grew rich in spite of indolence, and a neglect of his book, yet, when he died, two things appeared, which no tradesman in his wits would desire should be said of him.|$|E
60|$|Some men keep a due and exact entry or {{journal of}} all they sell, or perhaps of all they buy or sell, but are utterly remiss in posting it {{forward to a}} ledger; that is to say, to another book, where every parcel is carried to the debtor's {{particular}} account. Likewise they keep another book, where they enter all the money they receive, but, as above, never keeping any account for the man; there it stands in the <b>cash-book,</b> and both these books must be ransacked over for the particulars, as well of goods sold, as of the money received, when this customer comes to have his account made up; and as the goods are certainly entered when sold or sent away, and the money is certainly entered when it is received, this they think is sufficient, {{and all the rest}} superfluous.|$|E
6000|$|It is true, {{the neglect}} of the books is private and secret, and is seldom known to any body but the {{tradesman}} himself, at least till he comes to break, and be a bankrupt, and then you frequently hear them exclaim against him, upon that very account. 'Break!' {{says one of the}} assignees; 'how should he but break?--why, he kept no books; you never saw books kept in such a scandalous manner in your life; why, he has not posted his <b>cash-book,</b> for I know not how many months; nor posted his day-book and journal at all, except here and there an account that he perhaps wanted to know the balance of; and as for balancing his cash, I don't see any thing of that done, I know not how long. Why, this fellow could never tell how he went on, or how things stood with him: I wonder he did not break a long time ago.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "One mode," [...] says Clavering's correspondent, [...] "of {{amassing}} {{money at}} the Nabob's cost is curious. He is generally in arrears to the Company. Here the Governor, being cash-keeper, is generally on good terms with the banker, who manages matters thus. The Governor presses the Nabob for the balance due from him; the Nabob flies to his banker for relief; the banker engages to pay the money, and grants his notes accordingly, which he puts in the <b>cash-book</b> as ready money; the Nabob pays him an interest for it at two and three per cent per mensem, till the tunkaws he grants on the particular districts for it are paid. Matters in the mean time are so managed {{that there is no}} call for this money for the Company's service till the tunkaws become due. By this means not a cash is advanced by the banker, though he receives a heavy interest from the Nabob, which is divided as lawful spoil." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{as he has}} the {{fabrication}} of the records in his own hands, he trusts to those partial representations of his character and conduct, because the signatures of those members of government whom he seldom consults are affixed, as a public sanction; but you may form a just idea of their correctness and propriety, when you are informed that his Lordship, upon my noticing the heavy disbursements made for secret service money, ordered the sums to be struck off, and the accounts to be erased from the <b>cash-book</b> of the Company; and I think I cannot give you a better proof of his management of my country and revenues than by calling your attention to his conduct in the Ongole province, and by referring you to his Lordship's administration of your own jaghire, from whence he has brought to the public account the sum of twelve hundred pagodas for the last year's revenue, yet blazons forth his vast merits and exertions, and expects to receive the thanks of his Committee and Council.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite true, darling," [...] replied Mrs Tipps, who was {{a candid}} though obtuse soul; [...] "the result is unsatisfactory, eminently so; yet I cannot charge myself with {{careless}} omissions. See--here it is; on one side are my receipts. Your dear father always impressed it so earnestly on me that I should keep the receipts of money {{on one side of}} the accounts, and the payments on the other. I never could remember, by the way, on which side to put the receipts, and on which the payments, until he hit on the idea of making me contradict myself, and then I should be sure to keep right. He used to say (how well I remember it), `Now, darling, this is the way: Whenever you receive a sum of money to enter in your <b>cash-book,</b> always say to yourself, What side shall I put it on? If your mind suggests on the right, at once say No--because that would be wrong--right being wrong in this case,' and he did use to laugh so over that little pleasantry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 2. A {{tradesman}} endeavouring {{to balance}} his cash, should no more be satisfied if {{he finds a}} mistake in his cash one way, than another--that is to say, if he finds more in cash than by the balance of his <b>cash-book</b> ought to be there, than if he finds less, or wanting in cash. I know many, who, when they find it thus, sit down satisfied, and say, 'Well, there is an error, and I don't know where it lies; but come, it is an error on the right hand; I have more cash in hand than I should have, that is all, so I am well enough; let it go; I shall find it some time or other.' But the tradesman ought to consider that he is quite in the dark; and as he does not really know where it lies, so, for ought he knows, the error may really be to his loss very considerably--and the case is very plain, that it is as dangerous to be over, {{as it would be}} to be under; he should, therefore, never give it over till he has found it out, and brought it to rights. For example: ...|$|E
60|$|Again, it is {{the same}} case as in matters religious, with respect to the doing this in time, and while health and {{strength}} remain. For, as we say very well, and with great reason, that the work of eternity should not be left to the last moments; that a death-bed is no place, and a sick languishing body no condition, and the last breath no time, for repentance; so I may add, neither are these the place, the condition, nor the time, to make up our accounts. There is no posting the books on a death-bed, or balancing the <b>cash-book</b> in a high fever. Can the tradesman tell you where his effects lie, and to whom he has lent or trusted sums of money, or large quantities of goods, when he is delirious and light-headed? All these things must be done in time, and the tradesman should take care that his books should always do this for him, and then he has nothing to do but make his will, and dispose of what he has; and for the rest he refers them to his books, to know where every thing is to be had.|$|E
6000|$|I doubt {{not such}} tradesmen often suffer {{as much by}} their slothfulness and neglect of book-keeping, as might, {{especially}} if their business is considerable, pay for a book-keeper; for what is such a man's case, when his customer, suppose a country dealer, comes to town, which perhaps he does once a-year (as in the custom of other tradesmen), and desires to have his account made up? The London tradesman goes to his books, and first he rummages his day-book back for the whole year, and takes out the foot[32] of all the parcels sent to his chapman, and they make the debtor side of the account; then he takes his <b>cash-book,</b> if it deserves that name, and there he takes out all the sums of money which the chapman has sent up, or bills which he has received, and these make the creditor side of the account; and so the balance is drawn out, and this man thinks himself a mighty good accountant, that he keeps his books exactly; and so perhaps he does, {{as far as he}} keeps them at all; that is to say, he never sends a parcel away to his customer, but he enters it down, and never receives a bill from him, but he sets it down when the money is paid; but now take this man and his chap, together, as they are making up this account. The chapman, a sharp clever tradesman, though a countryman, has his pocket-book with him, and in it a copy of his posting-book, so the countrymen call a ledger, where the London tradesman's accounts are copied out; and when the city tradesman has drawn out his account, he takes it to his inn and examines it by his little book, and what is the consequence? ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{three men}} {{are all of}} that staid middle age which begins early and lasts late in the profession. They are none of them famous, yet each is of good repute, and a fair type of his {{particular}} branch. The portly man with the authoritative manner and the white, vitriol splash upon his cheek is Charley Manson, chief of the Wormley Asylum, {{and author of the}} brilliant monograph--"Obscure Nervous Lesions in the Unmarried." [...] He always wears his collar high like that, since the half-successful attempt of a student of Revelations to cut his throat with a splinter of glass. The second, with the ruddy face and the merry brown eyes, is a general practitioner, a man of vast experience, who, with his three assistants and his five horses, takes twenty-five hundred a year in half-crown visits and shilling consultations out of the poorest quarter of a great city. That cheery face of Theodore Foster is seen at the side of a hundred sick-beds a day, and if he has one-third more names on his visiting list than in his <b>cash-book</b> he always promises himself that he will get level some day when a millionaire with a chronic complaint--the ideal combination--shall seek his services. The third, sitting on the right with his dress-shoes shining {{on the top of the}} fender, is Hargrave, the rising surgeon. His face has none of the broad humanity of Theodore Foster's, the eye is stern and critical, the mouth straight and severe, but there is strength and decision in every line of it, and it is nerve rather than sympathy which the patient demands when he is bad enough to come to Hargrave's door. He calls himself a jawman, [...] "a mere jawman," [...] as he modestly puts it, but in point of fact he is too young and too poor to confine himself to a specialty, and there is nothing surgical which Hargrave has not the skill and the audacity to do.|$|E
60|$|The resolutions {{were adopted}} with but four dissenting votes; their meaning was obvious, {{and the whole}} country {{understood}} it to be peace on any conditions that would be condescended to at Richmond. If a nation were only a contrivance to protect men in gathering gear, if territory meant only so many acres for the raising of crops, if power were of worth only as a police to prevent or punish crimes against person and property, then peace for the mere sake of peace were the one desirable thing for a people whose only history would be written in its <b>cash-book.</b> But if a nation be a living unity, leaning on the past by tradition, and reaching toward the future by continued aspiration and achievement,--if territory be of value for the raising of men formed to high aims and inspired to noble deeds by that common impulse which, springing from a national ideal, gradually takes authentic shape in a national character,--if power be but a gross and earthy bulk till it be ensouled with thought and purpose, and of worth only as the guardian and promoter of truth and justice among men,--then there are misfortunes worse than war and blessings greater than peace. At this moment, not the Democratic party only, but the whole country, longs for peace, and the difference is merely as to the price that shall be paid for it. Shall we pay in degradation, and sue for a cessation of hostilities which would make chaos the rule and order the exception, which would not be peace, but toleration, not the repose of manly security, but the helpless quiet of political death? Or shall we pay, {{in a little more}} present suffering, self-sacrifice, and earnestness of purpose, for a peace that shall be as lasting as honorable, won as it will be by the victory of right over wrong, and resting on the promise of God and the hope of man? We believe the country has already made up its mind as to the answer, and will prove that a democracy may have as clear a conception of its interests and duties, as fixed a purpose in defending the one and fulfilling the other, a will as united and prompt, as have hitherto been supposed to characterize forms of government where the interests were more personal and the power less diffused.|$|E

5000|$|He was {{admitted}} a fellow commoner at Clare Hall, Cambridge on 22 May 1711 {{and became a}} lawyer, having entered the Middle Temple on 10 February 1711/2 and having been called to the bar in 1718. [...] From {{about the age of}} 21 he visited several country houses belonging to the Prideaux family and friends, and made many [...] "topographical drawings", many of which survive as valuable records of houses since demolished or altered, for example Stowe, Kilkhampton in Cornwall and Heanton Satchville, Petrockstowe in Devon. Following the death of his wife at a young age, he [...] "immersed himself in the study of all scholarly matters, particularly architecture and garden design". Unusually late in life, in about 1739 at the age of 46, he made a Grand Tour of Italy and brought back to England a collection of pictures and Roman antiquities.

50|$|In the 19th {{century when}} {{organizations}} started {{to grow a}} separate register of labour hours emerged, which was called a time book. There were used to keep account of the work done. Loudon (1826) explained, that in gardening the books necessary for the system of keeping accounts are, the time-book, the <b>cash-book,</b> and the forest or plantation book. Loudon described how time books where handled in those days: The master inserts the name of every hand; and the foreman of each department inserts the time in days, or proportions of a day, which each person under his care has been at work, and the particular work {{he or she has}} been engaged in. At the end of each week the master sums up the time from the preceding Saturday or Monday, to the Friday or Saturday inclusive; the sum due or to be advanced to each man is put in one column, and when the man receives it he writes the word received in the column before it, and signs his name as a receipt in the succeeding column.The time-book, therefore, will show what every man has been engaged in during every hour in the year for which he has been paid, and it will also contain receipts for every sum, however trifling, which has been paid by the gardener for garden-labour.|$|E
