40|$|Cutaneous biopsies (n = 94) {{obtained}} from 88 patients with American tegumentary leishmaniasis were studied by conventional and immunohistochemical techniques. Specimens were distributed as active lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis (n = 53) (Group I), <b>cicatricial</b> <b>lesions</b> of cutaneous leishmaniasis (n = 35) (Group II) and suggestive scars of healed mucosal leishmaniasis patients (n = 6) (Group III). In addition, active cutaneous lesions of other etiology (n = 24) (Group C 1) and cutaneous scars {{not related to}} leishmaniasis (n = 10) (Group C 2) were {{also included in the}} protocol. Amastigotes in Group I biopsies were detected by routine histopathological exam (30. 2 %), imprint (28. 2 %), culture (43. 4 %), immunofluorescence (41. 4 %) and immunoperoxidase (58. 5 %) techniques; and by the five methods together (79. 3 %). In Group II, 5. 7 % of cultures were positive. Leishmanial antigen was also seen in the cytoplasm of macrophages and giant cells (cellular pattern), vessel walls (vascular pattern) and dermal nerves (neural pattern). Positive reaction was detected in 49 (92. 5 %), 20 (57 %) and 4 (67 %) biopsies of Groups I, II and III, respectively. Antigen persistency in cicatricial tissue may be related to immunoprotection or, on the contrary, to the development of late lesions. We suggest that the cellular, vascular and neural patterns could be applied in the immunodiagnosis of active and <b>cicatricial</b> <b>lesions</b> in which leishmaniasis is suspected...|$|R
40|$|The extraocular muscle palsies {{associated}} with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) are transient, self-limiting conditions, usually seen in elderly patients. There are different treatment recommendations for paralytic complications, but prognosis has generally {{reported to be}} favorable. A 75 -year-old male patient presented with diplopia. Clinical history revealed left facial vesicular eruptions and pain treated by oral aciclovir 1 week following symptom onset. On examination, we observed <b>cicatricial</b> <b>lesions</b> with crusts involving left hemiface, a limitation in abduction of the left eye, and a superficial punctuate keratitis (SPK) with decreased visual acuity (4 / 10). Examination of the right eye was unremarkable. Hess screen test confirmed left six nerve palsy...|$|R
40|$|We {{read with}} special {{interest}} the case report 1 of a 50 -year-old immu-nocompetent patient with neurosyphilis mimicking herpes encepha-litis. The patient {{presented with a}} clinical syndrome of encephalitis and bilateral mesiotemporal hyperintensity on T 2 WI and FLAIR im-ages. It is known that neurosyphilis can present {{with a variety of}} CNS manifestations, sometimes mimicking other diseases and making the differential diagnosis difficult. We present an additional case of a syphilitic gumma with CNS involvement, with MR imaging findings resembling a brain stem glioma. A 26 -year-old man presented with a 4 -month history of fever, weight loss, dizziness, diarrhea, tremors, and paresthesia. Clinical ex-amination revealed disorientation, pyramidal and extrapyramidal symptoms, andmultiple cutaneous nonpruriginous <b>cicatricial</b> <b>lesions</b> affecting the chest and inferior limbs, suggestive of syphilitic roseola.

40|$|Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa {{is a rare}} {{variant of}} {{dystrophic}} epidermolysis bullosa characterized by severely pruritic and <b>cicatricial</b> <b>lesions</b> localized to the extensor extremities. We report a Singaporean Chinese male with epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa with an underlying novel mutation in the COL 7 A 1 gene. A heterozygous acceptor splice site mutation IVS 67 - 1 G>T probably led to in-frame skipping of exon 68 (36 -basepairs), resulting {{in a loss of}} 12 amino acids. Among his three children, only the youngest son, who had bilateral big toenail thickening, possessed the same mutation. His skin biopsy one decade ago revealed association of focal amyloidosis; a recent skin biopsy showed more established features of lichen amyloidosis. It is debatable whether the cutaneous amyloidosis was a secondary or primary phenomenon. Our report highlights that the diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa may be obscured when cutaneous amyloidosis is coexistent...|$|R
40|$|Eumycetoma is a mycotic disease {{caused by}} {{saprophytic}} soil fungi {{that are usually}} inoculated through minor injuries. A case of mycetoma in a Brazilian farmer aged 71 years is reported. This patient presented erythema and edema on the dorsal Surface of the left hand with multiple crusted and <b>cicatricial</b> <b>lesions.</b> No macroscopic grains were observed. the histopathological findings showed grains consisted of numerous hyphae which stained well with Gomori-Grocott method. This material obtained by cutaneous biopsy was submitted to culture on Sabouraud's medium and the colonies were identified as Fusarium solani. the radioloyical studies revealed bone osteolytic lesions and the ultrasound showed pseudocysts and fistulae {{at the site of}} this infection. the patient was treated with oral ketoconazole with a good clinical response.

40|$|Microscopic colitis (MC) is {{considered}} an &#x 201 C;umbrella term&#x 201 D;, comprising two subtypes, i. e., collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC). They are classically associated with normal or unremarkable colonoscopy. In the last few years, reports have been published revealing findings that {{are thought to be}} characteristic or pathognomonic of MC, especially CC. A systematic electronic and manual search of PubMed and EMBASE (to December 2010), for publications on distinct endoscopic findings in MC, resulted in 42 relevant reports for inclusion in this review. Eighty eight patients with collagenous colitis were presented. Only one publication describing a distinct endoscopic pattern in LC was found. Typical findings in CC are alteration of the vascular mucosal pattern, mucosal nodularity, a sequence of change from mucosal defects to mucosal <b>cicatricial</b> <b>lesions,</b> and perhaps (although of doubtful relevance) mucosal pseudomembranes. A causal connection of mucosal defects with the use of lansoprazole seems to exist. Adoption of the proposed lesion description herein is recommended in order to improve homogeneity of future reports...|$|R
40|$|Our aim was {{to study}} optical {{coherence}} tomographic findings {{in a case of}} Toxocara granuloma. A patient with a <b>cicatricial</b> macular <b>lesion,</b> diagnosed as ocular toxocariasis, was examined with optical coherence tomography. In optical coherence tomography images, the macular granuloma appeared as a highly reflective round mass protruding above the retinal pigment epithelium with two other surrounding masses. Optical coherence tomography may increase understanding of the pathophysiology of the retinal Toxocara granuloma and help in the clinical diagnosis and management of its macular complications...|$|R
40|$|A 81 -years-old {{caucasian}} man {{presented with}} acute burning pain in external auricular region {{and inside the}} auditory canal of right ear, associated with vesicular lesions on face, jugal and lingual mucosa. Physical examination revealed vesicular lesions in external auricular region and inside the auditory canal. Red blood cell count, leukocytes and platelets were normal. Presented HIV- 1 and 2 both negative. Patient denied previous history of Diabetes and Hypertension. Treatment was initiated with Ceftriaxone 2 g, Acyclovir 250 mg, Prednisone 60 mg and Bicarbonate Water for rinsing. After eight days of hospitalization, patient reported hearing loss in the right ear, chewing difficulty and mild pain in face. Auditory hearing loss and hypoacusis may suggest involvement of vestibulocochlear nerve. Figure 1 shows <b>cicatricial</b> crusted <b>lesions</b> following trigeminal nerve mandibular branch trajetory. Figure 2 reveals <b>cicatricial</b> crusted <b>lesions</b> following trigeminal nerve maxilar branch, trigeminal branch and erythematous scarring lesions in tongue, hypoglossal nerve region. Figure 3 reveals small crusted lesions following the trigeminal ophthalmic branch. Herpes zoster is caused by Varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation in individuals who had Varicella in childhood or who were vaccinated. The presence {{of more than one}} dermatome affected is rare in immunocompetent individuals, being more prevalent in immunosuppressed individuals such as HIV positive and transplanted patients. 1 Disseminated herpes zoster can occur in any immunocompetent patient but predominates in elderly due to factors that compromise cellular immune response. 2,...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the clinical presentation}} and determined the ocular and neurologic sequelae in children with congenital toxoplasmosis in Brazil, taking into consideration the shortage of national publications on this disease. Follow-up evaluations were made of 43 children with congenital toxoplasmosis referred to Santa Casa de São Paulo, {{during a period of}} at least five years. Selection of the cases was based in clinical and laboratory criteria. A clear predominance of children with subclinical presentation of the disease at birth (88 %) was found. Of the 43 children, 22 (51 %) developed neurological manifestations. Using skull radiography, we detected neuroradiologic alterations in seven children (16 %) and with tomography in 33 children (77 %). Neurological sequelae were identified in 15 children (54 %) in the group with cerebral calcifications and in 7 (47 %) in the group without cerebral calcifications. We observed chorioretinitis in 95 % of the cases. Reactivation of <b>cicatricial</b> <b>lesions</b> and the emergence of new ocular lesions were observed in five cases. The most frequent neurological manifestation was a delay in neuropsychomotor development. Most remarkable was the finding that cerebral calcifications were not associated with a higher incidence of neurological sequelae among the children. Chorioretinitis was the main ocular sequel of the infection, found in nearly all children; it can manifest years from birth, even in children submitted to specific therapy {{during the first year of}} life, highlighting the importance of a follow-up of these children...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{chemical}} agents to produce obstruction in the human oviduct was proposed {{more than a century}} ag 0. l In 1967, Corfman did a historical review of the problem. 2 The injection of caustic agents into the uterine cavity for contraception and sterilization is a technique that actually is in use in some countries. 3 No clinical evaluation of these methods has been done, {{with the exception of a}} preliminary communication* to the Fifth World Congress on Fertility and Sterility held in Tel Aviv in 1968. The importance of the development of a nonsurgical sterilization method using cytotoxics or antimetabolites has led to a systematic study of the action {{of chemical}} agents on the uterine epithelium of the rat ” and on the tubal epithelium of the rabbit 6 Research indicates that there are different groups of chemical agents that are capable of producing histological and functional changes which are potentially useful at different periods of time. Reversibility is not possible when there are intense <b>cicatricial</b> <b>lesions</b> that obstruct the treated cornua permanently. This paper is an evaluation of the clinical use of two groups of chemical agents: nonspecific sclerosing agents which obstruct the oviducts with the production of nonspecific cicatricial lesions; and highly specific chemical agents capable of inducing changes in the tubal epithelium by modifying its morphophysiology. Ethanol formalin, a nonspecific chemical agent, was used for three years of experimentation...|$|R
40|$|A bumblefoot {{outbreak}} {{with different}} prognosis according to host species was studied in captive aquatic avian species. Six wood ducks (Aix sponsa), three scarlet-ibis (Eudocimus ruber), two black-swans (Cygnus atratus), five white-faced ducks (Dendrocygna viduata) and two roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja) {{were kept in}} a common pen with abrasive pavement pond margin, predisposing to podal skin wear. Incoordination and mortality occurred in the two roseate spoonbils and one black swan. Coagulase-positive penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the synovial fluid and from the liver. All birds sharing the pen presented active or <b>cicatricial</b> foot <b>lesions,</b> indicating a possible challenge to the environmental Staphylococci. However, except for the roseate spoonbill and the black swan, which had fatal disease, for all other species the case did not evolve to a clinically debilitating or fatal disease. The different susceptibility to a fatal Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive infection is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Congenital {{varicella}} syndrome (CVS) {{is a rare}} but deleterious {{consequence of}} primary varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection during pregnancy. Typical CVS stigmata are cerebral abnormalities, eye diseases and segmentally distributed, <b>cicatricial</b> skin <b>lesions.</b> In this paper the authors report on a male preterm infant, born at 30 weeks of gestation, who developed pustular skin lesions {{at the age of}} 4 weeks. The mother had suffered from chickenpox at 14 weeks of gestation. Apart from skin manifestations, critical bronchopulmonary dysplasia made the infant conspicuous. The VZV genome was detected in blood, respiratory secretions and skin lesions. At age 10 weeks he presented with extensive intestinal wall perforation, considered to be related to CVS, which fi nally led to death. This case shows for the fi rst time the clinical course of CVS in a preterm infant. It illustrates the need for discussion of comprehensive VZV vaccination for seronegative women of childbearing age...|$|R

Este trabalho relata um surto de esparavão em aves aquáticas cativas com prognóstico variado conforme a espécie de ave. Foram examinados um marreco carolina (Aix sponsa), três guarás (íbis vermelha) (Eudocimus ruber), dois cisnes negros (Cygnus atratus), cinco marrecas piadeiras (Dendrocygna viduata) e dois colhereiros (Platalea ajaja) mantidos em recinto comunitário, em cativeiro e em criatório. No recinto, a piscina é margeada por borda de cimento abrasivo que possibilita a abrasão da pele podal. Todas as aves apresentaram erosões da pele na face de apoio dos pés, indicando fator predisponente (erosão) similar e possível semelhante desafio infeccioso. Entretanto, incoordenação e mortalidade ocorreram em colhereiros e no cisne negro, mas não nas outras espécies.

40|$|PURPOSE: To analyze indocyanine green {{angiography}} (ICGA) {{features in}} two cases of sympathetic ophthalmia using a standard angiography protocol for posterior uveitis. METHODS: Report on two patients {{who suffered from}} penetrating ocular injuries 45 and 8 years before sympathetic ophthalmia was diagnosed and confirmed by histopathological examination of the enucleated eye. In addition to routine examination and fluorescein angiography, initial and follow-up ICGAs were performed. RESULTS: The first patient, with a phthisic right eye following s shotgun injury, consulted 6 months after cataract extraction in his good left eye for progressive visual loss due to a neovascular membrane in a moderately inflamed eye. The second patient consulted 8 years after a perforating injury of his right eye by a metallic foreign body because of recent visual loss and inflammation in his good left eye. ICGA of both patients showed numerous hypofluorescent dark dots visible at the intermediate phase, some becoming isofluorescent at the late phase and resolving after long-term corticosteroid therapy, others remaining hypofluorescent until the late phase. CONCLUSION: The two patterns of hypofluorescent areas, either persisting throughout angiography or fading in the late phase, were interpreted respectively as <b>cicatricial</b> and active <b>lesions.</b> ICGA gave determining additional information on choroidal involvement and on subsequent evolution of lesions...|$|R
