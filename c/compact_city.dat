40|$|This paper {{presents}} a literature review on urban green space benefits and values and discusses green space qualities {{that are important}} in providing ecosystem services for sustainability of <b>compact</b> <b>cities.</b> Green spaces and elements provide many functions, services and benefits which are needed for the sustainable development of urban areas, as shown in numerous research studies. However, there is often a gap between the research findings on urban ecosystem services and urban planning processes, with green spaces risking being undervalued in <b>compact</b> <b>cities.</b> Two possible reasons for this gap are discussed in this paper: lack of compiled knowledge of the number and extent of ecosystem services provided by urban green space and the need for descriptions of valuable green space qualities including properties and potentials. Previous studies on urban green spaces and their contribution to economic, health, quality of life and ecological benefits in <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> are reviewed and described. Analysis of the literature indicates that sustainable <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> can be expected to need green spaces which are close to people, coherent and of sufficient size, varied and well-maintained and where people can engage in development. Such aspects can be increasingly considered in planning practice...|$|R

40|$|With {{characteristics}} differing from majority households, Latino {{growth is}} occurring {{at a time}} when California is torn between several urban development models—developing <b>compact</b> <b>cities,</b> preserving the environment, or increasing urban sprawl and slums. The central argument of this article is that Latinos’ cultural inclination to a lifestyle supportive of <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> provides policymakers with a sustainable alternative that possesses a built-in consumer base. The development and advancement of <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> in California may be dependent on the ability of policy makers to sustain and support the Latino lifestyle. This article addresses city development policies that pressure Latinos to assimilate to the established US notion of appropriate space use and how they undercut the economic, social, and environmental benefits inherent in the Latino lifestyle. The article also illustrates the key role Latinos play in adapting and transforming existing neighborhoods to promote New Urbanist-type landscapes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Recently, the underuse of {{wildlife}} {{and the increase}} in wildlife population due to decreased hunting have led to serious problems in both rural and urban areas. Traditional conservation methods are no longer applicable in such situations. The main purpose of this paper is, therefore, to explore ways to cope with increases in wildlife population and related issues, especially in urban areas. First, we present an overview of the current status {{of wildlife}} in urban areas, and examine why wildlife appears in cities. Then, after reviewing current expectations from <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> through a comparison of Japan and western countries, we examine additional requirements for <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> and depict possible future visions. Currently, the main objectives in establishing <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> are sustainability and the prevention of population decline in local cities. We assert that when current cities are transformed into <b>compact</b> <b>cities,</b> consideration should be given to returning some space to wildlife whose habitats were altered when the cities were developed. We affirm {{that it is possible to}} ensure some space for wildlife. One possible use of reclaimed areas is as wildlife corridors, which should be distinguished from green space for residents. Former vegetation should be restored and continuous corridors secured, with recognition of the value of wildlife. Index Terms—Compact city, coexistence, conflict, underuse...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} {{about the impact of}} urban sprawl on social exclusion. Inner cities suffer acute abandonment. Sprawl is {{encouraged}} by hidden government subsidies. However, traffic congestion creates opposition to further development. Dispersal and high-speed communication rely on concentrated, dense networks leading to the rescue and revaluation of declining city centres and inner neighbourhoods. Complex urban management problems deter would-be residents and financial incentives still favour suburban growth and green field building. However environmental and development pressures may cause a revaluation of urban and green land leading to more <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> and greater cohesion.

40|$|<b>Compact</b> <b>cities,</b> {{as opposed}} to the urban sprawl, are being {{advocated}} in many countries and regions. As a sustainable urban form, these have significant implications on the pursuit of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. However, despite their advantages, <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> have negative impacts on urban development. Both positive and negative impacts are derived from developed countries. However, whether these impacts are applicable to developing countries remains uncertain. This research aims to examine the development and impacts of urban compaction in China. Guided by land use policies, compact development in Beijing is currently being promoted through the intensification of existing construction areas rather than the development of new large-scale areas. This research aims to explore the development of urban compactness from the perspective of time and spatial dimensions and examine the impact of compact development. To carry out this research, this thesis reviews the relevant theories on <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> characterized as high-density developments and mixed-use developments of construction areas that have a well developed public transport system. These <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> can be achieved through urban intensification. In this work, an indicator system for measuring urban compactness based on the features of <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> (e. g., high-density development, mixed-use development, and public transport system) is proposed. The development of the urban compactness of an entire city during the period of 1992 - 2007 is also calculated according to the indicator system. In addition, the development of urban compactness in the different regions of inner city districts, outer city districts, and new towns in 1996, 2001, and 2006 are also studied. Given that <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> {{have a significant impact on}} urban development, some indicators that reveal economic, social, and environmental development are utilized to test the impact of <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> in Beijing through statistical studies and semi-structured interviews. The results of evaluating the urban compactness development from the entire city perspective indicate rapid population growth and urbanization, along with the rapid increase of urban density in Beijing. Compared with high-density development, mixed use development has not been as rapid. With the mass construction of the subways and the increase in the provision of public buses, the development of public transport has also improved significantly. Following these results, the impact of urban compaction is analyzed, and compact development appeared to be beneficial to economic, social and environmental development, although some of its benefits have not been embodied fully. This research further examines the spatial development of urban compactness. The findings reveal that land use in the central city has become increasingly compact and that the potential for urban compactness could be further enhanced in the outer city districts. In new towns where the urban sprawl is quite severe, high-density development and mixed-use development should be promoted. To increase accessibility, the public transport system should be further improved. By analyzing the development of urban compactness, this study suggests that the support facilities and services in Beijing are insufficient compared with population growth and urbanization occurring in the city; this inadequacy leads to the backward progress of mixed-use development. As a large city, the different regions in Beijing stand in different positions that require varied development strategies to achieve urban compaction. The study fills a gap in the literature on compact development in China and population growth as well as theoretically and empirically enriches the impact of urban compaction in the context of rapid urbanization and population growth. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} comprises {{a literature}} review on {{quality of life}} in <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> from a social scientific perspective. Though <b>compact</b> <b>cities</b> are generally thought to be the most sustainable urban form, it is debateable whether or not such cities do perform better across social, economic or bio-physical environmental measures. Furthermore, urban intensification and consolidation is often rejected and resisted by urban residents who prefer low-density, suburban settings. Consequently, cities continue to ‘sprawl’. This publication has four parts. Part one is an essay reviewing and synthesising lessons from the articles presented in the subsequent three sections. These sections each address a particular aspect of {{quality of life in}} the city: its form (part 2), the way it is governed and managed (part 3) {{and the ways in which}} people relate with each other and with ‘nature’ in the urban context (part 4) ...|$|R
