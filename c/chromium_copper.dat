40|$|Flame atomic {{absorption}} spectrometry (FAAS) was adopted to detect the construction vehicles automatic transmission through simultaneous determination of typical metal elements contents (<b>Copper,</b> <b>Chromium</b> and Iron) in automatic transmission fluid (ATF). Standard curves of <b>Copper,</b> <b>Chromium</b> and Iron were portrayed. Six parallel tests were implemented and the relative standard deviations (RSD) were 2. 59 %, 2. 89 % and 2. 71 % for <b>Copper,</b> <b>Chromium</b> and Iron separately. Additionally, under the same test conditions and analysis methods, contents of <b>Copper,</b> <b>Chromium</b> and Iron in different mileages of construction vehicles automatic transmission were tested. Analysis showed that, {{with the increase of}} mileage, the wear degree of construction vehicles automatic transmission increased and the contents of <b>Copper,</b> <b>Chromium</b> and Iron in ATF were also increased follow specific functions for each element under certain driving condition, and the correlation coefficients R were 0. 9994, 0. 9993 and 0. 9997 correspondingly. Finally, results illustrated that FAAS could serve as the rapid and non-destructive method to determine the contents of <b>Copper,</b> <b>Chromium</b> and Iron, and further to achieve the goal of examining the conditions of the major components of automatic transmission. </p...|$|R
25|$|Fly ash {{contains}} trace {{concentrations of}} heavy metals and other substances {{that are known}} to be detrimental to health in sufficient quantities. Potentially toxic trace elements in coal include arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, barium, <b>chromium,</b> <b>copper,</b> lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, radium, selenium, thorium, uranium, vanadium, and zinc. Approximately 10% of the mass of coals burned in the United States consists of unburnable mineral material that becomes ash, so the concentration of most trace elements in coal ash is approximately 10 times the concentration in the original coal. A 1997 analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) found that fly ash typically contained 10 to 30 ppm of uranium, comparable to the levels found in some granitic rocks, phosphate rock, and black shale.|$|E

60|$|Notwithstanding the {{foregoing}} facts, which show how widely different {{is the effect}} of certain substances on the health or life of animals and of Drosera, yet there exists a certain degree of parallelism in the action of certain other substances. We have seen that this holds good in a striking manner with the salts of sodium and potassium. Again, various metallic salts and acids, namely those of silver, mercury, gold, tin, arsenic, <b>chromium,</b> <b>copper,</b> and platina, most or all of which are highly poisonous to animals, are equally so to Drosera. But it is a singular fact that the chloride of lead and two salts of barium were not poisonous to this plant. It is an equally strange fact, that, though acetic and propionic acids are highly poisonous, their ally, formic acid, is not so; and that, whilst certain vegetable acids, namely oxalic, benzoic, &c., are poisonous in a high degree, gallic, tannic, tartaric, and malic (all diluted to an equal degree) are not so. Malic acid induces inflection, whilst the three other just named vegetable acids have no such power. But a pharmacopoeia would be requisite to describe the diversified effects of various substances on Drosera.|$|E
