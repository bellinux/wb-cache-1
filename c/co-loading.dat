In just two years as a Senator, Bam was able to have four of his measures into laws, namely the Philippine Competition Act, a landmark legislation that levels the playing field for all business, whether big or small, as it will penalize cartel-like behaviors, anticompetitive agreements, abuses of dominant position, and anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions. He also pushed for {{the passage of the}} Foreign Ships <b>Co-Loading</b> Act, which allows foreign ships carrying imported cargoes and cargoes to be exported out of the country to dock in multiple ports, leading to lower cost in logistics and prices of goods in the market. Moreover, the Philippine Lemon Law is his first pro-consumer legislation. Lastly, he worked for the passage of the Go Negosyo Act, which mandates the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to establish Negosyo Centers all over the country that will provide access to linkages to bigger markets and financing, business development programs, and a unified and simplified business registration process. As of August 2015, 75 business centers have already been put up. He passed four more laws in 2015, including landmark legislation - the Philippine Competition Act - set to revolutionize the playing field for businesses, particularly for MSMEs and start-ups.

Research in nanobiotechnology-based therapeutic alternatives has provided innovative and promising strategies to overcome MDR. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate whether the new strategy of a <b>co-loaded</b> reversal agent and chemotherapeutic drug with shortened carbon nanotubes (CNTs) would show useful effects on the real-time reversal of tumor MDR. CNTs were cut and purified via ultrasonication and oxidative acid treatment to optimize their length for drug-delivery vehicles, then verapamil (Ver) and doxorubicin (Dox) were <b>co-loaded</b> on shortened CNTs (denoted as Ver/Dox/shortened CNTs), which acted as a drug delivery system. The multidrug resistant leukemia K 562 /A 02 cells were treated with the denoted Ver/Dox/shortened CNTs. The real-time reversal of tumor MDR were evaluated by flow cytometer, 3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, and Western blot analysis. In the same MDR tumor cells the new strategy of a <b>co-loaded</b> reversal agent and chemotherapeutic drug with CNTs could inhibit the function of P-glycoprotein in real-time by Ver as reversal agent, significantly increase the uptake of Dox, enhance the sensitivity of the MDR cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent, and induce apoptosis.

Based on a risk assessment, six parameters, namely the phospholipid, CUR and DOX concentrations, the phospholipid:cholesterol molar ratio, the temperature during the evaporation and hydration steps and the pH of the phosphate buffer, were identified as potential risk factors for the quality of the final product. The influence of these variables on the critical quality attributes of the <b>co-loaded</b> liposomal CUR and DOX was investigated: particle size, zeta potential, drug loading and entrapment efficiency. For this, a 26 - 2 factorial design was employed to establish a proper regression model and to generate the contour plots for the responses. The obtained data served to establish the design space for which different combinations of variables yielded liposomes with characteristics within predefined specifications. The validation of the model was carried out by preparing two liposomal formulations corresponding to the robust set point from within the design space and one outside the design space and calculating the percentage bias between the predicted and actual experimental results. The in vitro antiproliferative test showed that at higher CUR concentrations, the liposomes co-encapsulating CUR and DOX had a greater cytotoxic effect than DOX-loaded liposomes. Overall, this study showed that QbD is a useful instrument for controlling and optimizing the manufacturing process of liposomes <b>co-loaded</b> with CUR and DOX and that this nanoparticulate system possesses a great potential for use in colon cancer therapy.

After intranasal vaccination in mice, MDP adjuvanted OVA in TMC nanoparticles induce higher IgG 1 and IgA titers than that without adjuvants (Bal et al., 2012). It {{has been suggested that}} the loading efficiency of small substances like immunostimulant MDP in TMC nanoparticles may decrease when <b>co-loaded</b> with large, water-soluble molecules like protein OVA, presumably caused by the increased leakage of MDP through diffusion channels generated by the leakage of OVA during the formulation preparation (Mathew et al., 2014).|$|R

After the DNR and Br were <b>co-loaded</b> onto a pluronic-stabilized and oleic acid-modified magnetic nanosystem, the physical characteristic and drug-loading capacity were evaluated. The cell toxicity of the self-prepared DNR/BrTet-MNPs formulation was then determined by MTT (3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay; the cellular uptake of drug was demonstrated by fluorescent microscope. Lastly, the transcription of mdr 1 and the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) were detected by the reverse transcription reaction and western blotting assay, respectively. The results showed that the self-prepared DNR/BrTet-MNPs formulation possessed a sustained release of drug and displayed a dose-dependent antiproliferative activity on MDR leukemia K 562 /A 02 cells. It also enhanced the accumulation of intracellular DNR in K 562 /A 02 cells and downregulated the transcription of the mdr 1 gene and the expression of P-gp. These findings suggest that the remarkable effect of the novel DNR/BrTet-MNPs formulation, acting as a drug depot system for the sustained release of the loaded DNR and BrTet, on multidrug resistance leukemia K 562 /A 02 cells would be a promising strategy for overcoming MDR.

40|$|Resveratrol and {{gallic acid}} were co-loaded in {{phospholipid}} vesicles aiming at protecting the skin from external injuries, such as oxidative stress and microbial infections. Liposomes were prepared using biocompatible phospholipids dispersed in water. To improve vesicle stability and applicability, the phospholipids and the phenols were dispersed in water/propylene glycol or water/glycerol, thus obtaining PEVs and glycerosomes, respectively. The vesicles {{were characterized by}} size, morphology, physical stability, and their therapeutic efficacy was investigated in vitro. The vesicles were spherical, unilamellar and small in size: liposomes and glycerosomes were around 70  nm in diameter, while PEVs were larger (∼ 170  nm). The presence of propylene glycol or glycerol increased the viscosity of the vesicle systems, positively affecting their stability. The ability of the vesicles to promote the accumulation of the phenols (especially gallic acid) in the skin was demonstrated, {{as well as their}} low toxicity and great ability to protect keratinocytes and fibroblasts from oxidative damage. Additionally, an improvement of the antimicrobial activity of the phenols was shown against different skin pathogens. The <b>co-loading</b> of resveratrol and gallic acid in modified phospholipid vesicles represents an innovative, bifunctional tool for preventing and treating skin affections...|$|E
40|$|Photocatalytic {{oxidation}} {{has been}} demonstrated {{to be an effective}} way for removing organic pollutants via a complete mineralization. The removal of sulfur-containing organic compounds in fuel oils and pollutants such as rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) present in the industrial wastewater is highly desired. Here we studied the photocatalytic oxidation of the pollutants on Pt-RuO 2 /TiO 2 photocatalyst. We found that TiO 2 co-loaded with noble metal Pt and metal oxide RuO 2 shows the considerably synergistic effect between the two cocatalysts on photocatalytic oxidation activity. This effect {{has been demonstrated}} for photocatalytic oxidation of thiophene and successfully extended to photocatalytic oxidation of organic dyes. The high activity is achieved by <b>co-loading</b> less than 0. 05 wt% Pt and 0. 05 wt% RuO 2 as cocatalysts on TiO 2. ESR measurements give the evidence for that the active oxygen species ((OH) -O-center dot and O- 2 (center dot-)) generated by photocatalytic processes are involved in photocatalytic oxidation reactions. The reduction cocatalyst Pt and oxidation cocatalyst RuO 2 play significant roles in the photocatalytic oxidation reaction and the co-existing of the dual function cocatalysts is crucial for developing highly active photocatalysts for environmental protection.

40|$|Activities of {{nanostructure}} HZSM- 5 and Co-ZSM- 5 catalysts (with different <b>Co-loading)</b> for {{catalytic conversion}} of ethyl acetate and toluene were studied. The catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation method and were charac-terized by XRD, BET, SEM, TEM and ICP-AES techniques. Catalytic studies {{were carried out}} inside a U-shaped fixed bed reactor under atmospheric pressure and different temperatures. Toluene showed lower reactivity than ethyl acetate for conversion on Co-ZSM- 5 catalysts. The effect of Co loading on conversion was prominent at temperatures below 400 oC and 450 oC for ethyl acetate and toluene respectively. In a binary mixture of organic compounds, toluene and ethyl acetate showed an inhibition and promotional behaviors respectively, in which the conversion of toluene was decreased at temperatures above 350 oC. Inhibition effect of water vapor was negligible at temperatures above 400 oC. An artificial neural networks model was developed to predict the conversion efficiency of ethyl acetate on Co-ZSM- 5 catalysts based on experimental data. Predicted results showed a good agreement with experimental results. ANN model-ing predicted the order of studied variable effects on ethyl acetate conversion, which was as follows: reaction tem-perature (50 %) > ethyl acetate inlet concentration (25. 085 %) > content of Co loading (24. 915 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to study the effect of addition of four weak acids (adipic, suberic, phthalic and sebacic acids) on the regeneration of three types of <b>CO-loaded</b> rich solvents (Monoethanolamine (MEA), Diethanolamine (DEA) and Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA)). It was found that CO could be released faster and in a larger quantity when the amount of acid added to the solvent was increased while other desorption conditions were maintained unchanged. Adipic acid appeared {{to be more effective}} than phthalic, suberic and sebacic acids in enhancing solvent regeneration rate. Among the three amines investigated, MEA had the highest CO desorption rate, while DEA saved the most energy. The effect of adipic acid residue in the MEA solvent on CO absorption was also investigated. The residue acid reduced the absorption capacity of the MEA solvent significantly when the solvent concentration was low and slightly when the concentration was high...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{quercetin}} and resveratrol, natural polyphenols with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, were <b>co-loaded</b> in polymer-associated liposomes conceived for oral delivery, by exploiting {{the potential of}} pH-sensitive succinyl-chitosan. Chitosan was succinylated, characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy and Gel Permeation Chromatography, and used to form a protective shell {{on the surface of}} liposomes. The physico-chemical properties of the succinyl-chitosan liposomes were assessed by light scattering, zeta potential, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, and small angle X-ray scattering. Small, spherical, uni- and bilamellar vesicles were produced. The succinyl-chitosan shell increased not only the physical stability of the vesicular system, as demonstrated by accelerated stability tests, but also the release of the polyphenols to a greater extent at pH 7. 0, mimicking the intestinal environment. The proposed approach based on polyphenol vesicular formulations may be of value in the treatment of pre-cancerous/cancerous intestinal conditions associated with inflammation and oxidative stress...|$|R
40|$|In the hydrometallurgical {{processing}} of nickel laterite ore, {{a significant amount}} of dissolved nickel and cobalt can be lost to neutralized tailings slurry during counter current decantation. Resin-in-pulp (RIP) scavenging using ion exchange resin functionalized with iminodiacetic acid (IDA) has been proposed as an effective way to recover lost metal value. However, the tendency of this resin to <b>co-load</b> impurities makes integration of metal value back into the plant challenging. In this paper, the application of bis-picolylamine functionalized resin to RIP scavenging is explored. Both types of resin load the valuable metals effectively but bis-picolylamine functionalized resin has a much lower affinity for unwanted impurities. After loading, selective elution of nickel and cobalt from the new resin was carried out using an ammonia based eluent. The resultant eluate was high in nickel and cobalt with ppm levels of impurities, making it appropriate for downstream integration in existing nickel/cobalt refineries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
