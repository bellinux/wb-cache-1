5000|$|Re{{insurance}} is {{insurance that}} is purchased by {{an insurance company}} (the [...] "ceding company" [...] or [...] "cedent" [...] or [...] "cedant" [...] under the arrangement) from one or more insurance companies (the [...] "reinsurer") directly or through a broker {{as a means of}} risk management, sometimes in practice including tax mitigation and other reasons described below. The <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> and the reinsurer enter into a reinsurance agreement which details the conditions upon which the reinsurer would pay a share of the claims incurred by the <b>ceding</b> <b>company.</b> The reinsurer is paid a [...] "reinsurance premium" [...] by the <b>ceding</b> <b>company,</b> which issues insurance policies to its own policyholders.|$|E
50|$|A pure 'fin re' {{contract}} for a non-life insurer tends {{to cover a}} multi-year period, during which the premium is held and invested by the reinsurer. It is returned to the <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> - minus a pre-determined profit-margin for the reinsurer - either when the period has elapsed, or when the <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> suffers a loss. 'Fin re' therefore differs from conventional reinsurance {{because most of the}} premium is returned whether there is a loss or not: little or no risk-transfer has taken place.|$|E
5000|$|The {{arrangement}} may be [...] "quota share" [...] or [...] "surplus reinsurance" [...] (also {{known as}} surplus of line or variable quota share treaty) {{or a combination}} of the two. Under a quota share arrangement, a fixed percentage (say 75%) of each insurance policy is reinsured. Under a surplus share arrangement, the <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> decides on a [...] "retention limit" [...] - say $100,000. The <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> retains the full amount of each risk, with a maximum of $100,000 per policy or per risk, and the balance of the risk is reinsured.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the growth}} in the {{international}} nature of the reinsurance market, there has been increasing pressure in the United States (U. S.) for a system that would permit alien reinsurers, those assuming business from U. S. domiciled <b>ceding</b> <b>companies,</b> a reduced level of collateral, provided certain conditions were met. Support for this change has come from Lloyds, the London market and other non-U. S. -based reinsurers, and a small number of U. S. -based <b>ceding</b> <b>companies.</b> There has been strong opposition to this from U. S. reinsurers, most U. S. primary companies and others. This paper will give an overview of the U. S. reinsurance collateral requirement and discuss issues with perspectives from both sides. It is not the intent of this paper to advocate any position on the issue.

5000|$|Treaty Reinsurance {{means that}} the <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> and the {{reinsurer}} negotiate and execute a reinsurance contract under which the reinsurer covers the specified share of all the insurance policies issued by the <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> which come {{within the scope of}} that contract. The reinsurance contract may oblige the reinsurer to accept reinsurance of all contracts within the scope (known as [...] "obligatory" [...] reinsurance), or it may allow the insurer to choose which risks it wants to cede, with the reinsurer obliged to accept such risks (known as [...] "facultative-obligatory" [...] or [...] "fac oblig" [...] reinsurance).|$|E
50|$|The <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> {{may seek}} a quota share {{arrangement}} for several reasons. First, {{it may not}} have sufficient capital to prudently retain all of the business that it can sell. For example, it may only be able to offer a total of $100 million in coverage, but by reinsuring 75% of it, it can sell four times as much.|$|E
5000|$|Facultative Reinsurance, {{which is}} {{negotiated}} separately for each insurance policy that is reinsured. Facultative reinsurance is normally purchased by ceding companies for individual risks not covered, or insufficiently covered, by their reinsurance treaties, for amounts {{in excess of}} the monetary limits of their reinsurance treaties and for unusual risks. Underwriting expenses, and in particular personnel costs, are higher for such business because each risk is individually underwritten and administered. However, as they can separately evaluate each risk reinsured, the reinsurer's underwriter can price the contract more accurately to reflect the risks involved. Ultimately, a facultative certificate is issued by the reinsurance company to the <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> reinsuring that one policy.|$|E
40|$|More {{and more}} <b>ceding</b> <b>companies</b> {{are asking for}} global {{protection}}s of their portfolios. One example is the protection by the reinsurer of two (or more) lines, e. g. fire and motor third party liability. Clearly this allows the insurance company to optimally balance its portfolio and to pay the lowest reinsurance premium.

40|$|Re{{insurance}} is {{insurance that}} {{an insurance company}} purchases from another insurance company. The original insurance company is called the reinsured, and the insurance company that is contracted is called the reinsurer. The main purpose of reinsurance is to disperse or spread the risk of loss. The reinsurance relationship is frequently characterized as an exercise of fiduciary responsibility based upon an undertaking of utmost good faith between contracting parties. However, disputes arise; most litigation involving reinsurance has been between reinsurers and persons not party to the reinsurance agreement. This paper’s first major area of discussion {{is the relationship between}} the reinsurer and the reinsured. In particular this paper will focus on whether the duty of disclosure in the reinsurance context rises to a fiduciary duty, issues concerning reinsurers’ involvement in the defense of claims, and the liability of the reinsurer to reimburse <b>ceding</b> <b>companies</b> for losses resulting from the <b>ceding</b> <b>company’s</b> failure to perform contractual obligations. This paper’s second major area of analysis concerns reinsurance-related issues stemming from the insolvency of insurers. Finally, this paper discusses the insolvency dilemma that the insurance industry has recently encountered and examines possible options available to reinsurers and the reinsured in their efforts to stabilize practices in the reinsurance business...|$|R
50|$|The <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> {{may seek}} surplus {{reinsurance}} {{to limit the}} losses it might incur from {{a small number of}} large claims as a result of random fluctuations in experience. In a 9 line surplus treaty the reinsurer would then accept up to $900,000 (9 lines). So if the insurance company issues a policy for $100,000, they would keep all of the premiums and losses from that policy. If they issue a $200,000 policy, they would give (cede) half of the premiums and losses to the reinsurer (1 line each). The maximum automatic underwriting capacity of the cedant would be $1,000,000 in this example. Any policy larger than this would require facultative reinsurance.|$|E
5000|$|Sidecars have {{precedents}} in the reinsurance market {{under the}} name [...] "quota-share reinsurance." [...] In such an agreement, a re/insurer agrees to cede to the quota-share reinsurer a percentage of all premiums arising from a book of business {{in exchange for the}} reinsurer bearing the same percentage liability for losses. The quota-share reinsurer pays an amount called the [...] "ceding commission" [...] to compensate the <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> for its expenses. The ceding commission typically also includes a profit allowance, which increases in proportion to the expected profitability of the business. These reinsurance treaties currently and traditionally provide ceding companies with the ability to write more business than they could bear based on their own capital and to earn a certain amount of fee-based income (through the ceding commission). Quota-share reinsurers act as insurance wholesalers, allowing them to earn a return on capital without creating primary insurance distribution. Lloyd's of London [...] "names" [...] act as such reinsurers, placing the resources of individual and firms at risk to books of business written by professional underwriters and agents.|$|E
40|$|Section 8 D. a. {{applies to}} a company’s {{aggregate}} gross reserve before reinsurance. The reserve calculation requires {{a projection of}} future year-by-year cash flows, which includes such items as investment earnings and general insurance expenses. If a company has ceded 100 % of the business to an authorized reinsurer by use of coinsurance, the assets and net liabilities are {{no longer on the}} ceding company’s books. Additionally, the administration is also generally transferred to the reinsurer. In such circumstances, the projection of future cash flows is “hypothetical ” in that one must assume a starting asset portfolio, future investment strategy, future general insurance expenses, and so on. Furthermore, the <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> generally does not have the data or systems to determine the reserves and must rely on the assuming company. Since the assuming company is required to calculate the reserves on both direct and assumed business, may the <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> use the reserves as reported by the reinsurer in the reinsurer’s annual statement...|$|E

However, if firms seek funds due to challenges related to ownership changes, the difference between family firms and non-family firms decreases. Moreover, we find that family firms sell more company shares if they are run by a PE-experienced manager...|$|R

40|$|The Life {{insurance}} {{industry has been}} heavily regulated by the authorities because it plays {{a very important role}} in society and because insurance contracts are not easy to understand for general customers. Heavy regulation results in less discretion for managers to decide. However, most regulations emphasize the solvency test and pay less attention to the manager compensation issue. Also, the close regulation and the alleged less managerial discretion do not solve the agency problem between managers and owners. ^ This study is an evaluation of managerial compensation as it relates to reinsurance activity. The approach taken is to empirically test the following proposition: is managerial compensation a determinant of the reinsurance activity; if so, it should be significantly related to reinsurance activity. ^ Reinsurance is a contract to shift part or all of the insurance originally written by one insurer, the <b>ceding</b> <b>company,</b> to another insurer, the reinsurer. The reinsurance activity, most importantly determining the amount of insurance retained by the <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> for its own account, is subject to considerable management discretion. The setting of an appropriate reinsurance amount is a non-trivial decision for an insurer. It ultimately affects both the risk exposure and the profitability of the <b>ceding</b> <b>company.</b> Also, it impacts annual income of the insurer significantly. As a result, reinsurance activity represents a potentially significant area for insurance company managers to attempt to manage earnings. Theoretically, reinsurance activity should represent underlying economic reality. Many variables influence reinsurance activity and many considerations can be involved in determining an accurate reinsurance activity. ^ The first finding provides some preliminary evidence that managers manage the income but they do not manage the income for compensation purposes but rather for income smoothing. The results from extended research give only limited support to the theory that managers may in restricted case manage earnings to affect their bonus income. ^ The mixed results may be attributable to the following reasons. First, some companies do not change reinsurance activity yearly, especially when the reinsurance contract is an automatic basis. Second, due to recapture provisions, the impact on annual income by the change of legal reserve caused by different reinsurance for new policies is limited. ...|$|E

It begins by explaining how information problems affect the efficiency of the allocation of risk between insurer and reinsurer, and how long-term implicit contracts between insurers and reinsurers allow the inclusion of new information in the pricing of both future and past reinsurance coverage. Because of these features, the <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> purchases a more efficient quantity of reinsurance. Specifically, such arrangements lead to more reinsurance coverage, higher insurer profits, and lower expected distress in the industry. It is, in short, Pareto improving. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} the {{numerical}} computation of the optimal form of reinsurance from the <b>ceding</b> <b>company</b> point of view, when the cedent seeks to maximize the adjustment coefficient of the retained risk and the reinsurance loading is an increasing function of the variance. We compare the optimal treaty with the best stop loss policy. The optimal arrangement can provide a significant improvement in the adjustment coefficient when compared to the best stop loss treaty. Further, it is substantially more robust with respect to choice of retention level than stop-loss treaties.
