50|$|Brushing {{preservatives}} is a long-practised {{method and}} {{often used in}} today's carpentry workshops. Technological developments mean {{it is also possible}} to spray preservative over the surface of the timber. Some of the liquid is drawn into the wood as the result of capillary action before the spray runs off or evaporates, but unless puddling occurs penetration is limited and may not be suitable for long-term weathering. By using the spray method, <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote,</b> oil-borne <b>solutions</b> and water-borne salts (to some extent) can also be applied. A thorough brush or spray treatment with <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> can add 1 to 3 years to the lifespan of poles or posts. Two or more coats provide better protection than one, but the successive coats should not be applied until the prior coat has dried or soaked into the wood. The wood should be seasoned before treatment.|$|R
2500|$|Lignite-tar {{creosote}} {{is produced}} from lignite rather than bituminous coal, and varies considerably from <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote.</b> Also called [...] "lignite oil", {{it has a}} very high content of tar acids, and has been used to increase the tar acids in normal creosote when necessary. When it has been produced, its generally been applied in mixtures with <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> or petroleum. Its effectiveness when used alone has not been established. In an experiment with southern yellow pine fence posts in Mississippi, straight lignite-tar creosote was giving good results after about 27 years exposure, although not as good as the standard <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> used in the same situation.|$|R
2500|$|The {{two main}} kinds {{recognized}} in industry are <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> and [...] wood-tar <b>creosote.</b> The <b>coal-tar</b> variety, having {{stronger and more}} toxic properties, has chiefly {{been used as a}} preservative for wood; <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> was also formerly used as an escharotic, to burn malignant skin tissue, and in dentistry, to prevent necrosis, before its carcinogenic properties became known. The wood-tar variety has been used for meat preservation, ship treatment, and such medical purposes as an anaesthetic, antiseptic, astringent, expectorant, and laxative, though these have mostly been replaced by modern formulations.|$|R
2500|$|For {{some part}} of their history, <b>coal-tar</b> <b>{{creosote}}</b> and wood-tar creosote were {{thought to have been}} equivalent substances—albeit of distinct origins—accounting for their common name; the two were determined only later to be chemically different. All types of creosote are composed of phenol derivatives and share some quantity of monosubstituted phenols, but these are not the only active element of creosote. For their useful effects, <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> relies on the presence of naphthalenes and anthracenes, while wood-tar creosote relies on the presence of methyl ethers of phenol. [...] Otherwise, either type of tar would dissolve in water.|$|R
25|$|<b>Coal-tar</b> <b>creosote,</b> {{despite its}} toxicity, {{was used as}} a {{stimulant}} and escharotic, as a caustic agent used to treat ulcers and malignancies and cauterize wounds and prevent infection and decay. It was particularly used in dentistry to destroy tissues and arrest necrosis.|$|R
25|$|The simple phenols are not {{the only}} active element in wood-tar <b>creosote.</b> In <b>solution,</b> they {{coagulate}} albumin, which is a water-soluble protein found in meat; so they serve as a preserving agent, but also cause denaturation. Most of the phenols in the creosote are methoxy derivatives—they contain the methoxy group linked to the benzene nucleus (OCH3). The high level of methyl derivates created from the action of heat on wood (also apparent in the methyl alcohol produced through distillation) make wood-tar creosote substantially different from <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote.</b> Guaiacol is a methyl ether of pyrocatechin, while creosol is a methyl ether of methyl-pyrocatechin, the next homolog of pyrocatechin. Methyl ethers differ from simple phenols in being less hydrophilic, caustic and poisonous. This allows meat to successfully be preserved without tissue denaturation, and allows creosote {{to be used as a}} medical ointment.|$|R
2500|$|Historically, <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> {{has been}} {{distinguished}} {{from what was}} thought of as creosote proper—the original substance of Reichenbach's discovery—and it has been [...] referred to specifically as [...] "creosote oil". But, because <b>creosote</b> from <b>coal-tar</b> and wood-tar are obtained from a similar process and have some common uses, they have also been placed {{in the same class}} of substances, with the terms [...] "creosote" [...] or [...] "creosote oil" [...] referring to either product.|$|R
25|$|Independently, {{there were}} {{investigations}} into the chemical nature of creosote. A study by F.K. Völkel revealed that the smell of purified creosote resembled that of guaiacol, and later studies by Heinrich Hlasiwetz identified a substance common to guaiacum and creosote that he called creosol, and he determined that creosote contained a mixture of creosol and guaiacol. Later investigations by Gorup-Besanez, A.E. Hoffmann, and Siegfried Marasse showed that wood-tar creosote also contained phenols, giving it a feature in common with <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Wood-tar {{creosote}} is to {{some extent}} used for wood preservation, but it is generally mixed with <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote,</b> since the former is not as effective. Commercially available preparations of [...] "liquid smoke", marketed to add a smoked flavour to meat and aid as a preservative, consist primarily of creosote and other constituents of smoke. Creosote is the ingredient that gives liquid smoke its function; guaicol lends to the taste and the creosote oils help act as the preservative. Creosote can be destroyed by treatment with chlorine, either sodium hypochlorite, or calcium hypochlorite solutions. The phenol ring is essentially opened, and the molecule is then subject to normal digestion and normal respiration.|$|R
25|$|Water-gas-tar {{creosote}} is also {{derived from}} petroleum oil or shale oil, {{but by a}} different process; its distilled during the production of water gas. The tar is a by-product resulting from enrichment of water gas with gases produced by thermal decomposition of petroleum. Of the creosotes derived from oil, it is practically the only one used for wood preservation. It has {{the same degree of}} solubility as <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> and is easy to impregnate into wood. Like standard oil-tar creosote, it has a low amount of tar acids and tar bases, and has less antiseptic qualities. Petri dish tests have shown that water-gas-tar creosote is one-sixth as anti-septically effective as that of coal-tar.|$|R
25|$|Oil-tar {{creosote}} {{is derived}} from the tar that forms when using petroleum or shale oil in the manufacturing of gas. The distillation of the tar from the oil occurs at very high temperatures; around 980°C. The tar forms {{at the same time as}} the gas, and once processed for creosotes contains a high percentage of cyclic hydrocarbons, a very low amount of tar acids and tar bases, and no true anthracenes have been identified. Historically, this has mainly been produced in the United States in the Pacific coast, where petroleum has been more abundant than coal. Limited quantities have been used industrially, either alone, mixed with <b>coal-tar</b> <b>creosote,</b> or fortified with pentachlorophenol.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> is {{the most}} widely used wood {{treatment}} today; both industrially, processed into wood using pressure methods such as [...] "full-cell process" [...] or [...] "empty-cell process", and more commonly applied to wood through brushing. In addition to toxicity to fungi, insects, and marine borers, it serves as a natural water repellant. It's commonly used to preserve and waterproof cross ties, pilings, telephone poles, power line poles, marine pilings, and fence posts. Although suitable for use in preserving the structural timbers of buildings, it is not generally used that way because it is difficult to apply.

2500|$|<b>Coal-tar</b> <b>creosote</b> is greenish-brown liquid, with {{different}} degrees of darkness, viscosity, and fluorescence depending on how it's made.

The ability of indigenous soil microorganisms to remove these contaminants from aqueous solutions was determined by gas chromatographic analysis of organic extracts of biotreated groundwater. Changes in potential environmental and human health hazards associated with the biodegradation of this material were determined at intervals by Microtox assays and fish toxicity and teratogenicity tests. After 14 days of incubation at 30 degrees C, indigenous microorganisms effectively removed 100, 99, 94, 88, and 87 % of measured phenolic and lower-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and S-heterocyclic, N-heterocyclic, and O-heterocyclic constituents of creosote, respectively. However, only 53 % of the higher-molecular-weight PAHs were degraded; PCP was not removed. Despite the removal {{of a majority of}} the organic contaminants through biotreatment, only a slight decrease in the toxicity and teratogenicity of biotreated groundwater was observed. Data suggest that toxicity and teratogenicity are associated with compounds difficult to treat biologically and that one may not necessarily rely on indigenous microorganisms to effectively remove these compounds in a reasonable time span; to this end, alternative or supplemental approaches may be necessary. Similar measures of the toxicity and teratogenicity of treated material may offer a simple, yet important, guide to bioremediation effectiveness...|$|R
25|$|Following that, {{that was}} a period of {{experimentation}} of different techniques and chemicals using creosote in tuberculosis, which lasted until about 1910, when radiation therapy looked to be a more promising treatment. Guaiacol, instead of a full <b>creosote</b> <b>solution,</b> was suggested by Hermann Sahli in 1887; he argued it had the active chemical of creosote and had the advantage of being of definite composition and of having a less unpleasant taste and odor. A number of <b>solutions</b> of both <b>creosote</b> and guaiacol appeared on the market, such as phosphotal and guaicophosphal, phosphites of creosote and guaiacol; eosot and geosot, valerinates of creosote and guaicol; phosot and taphosot, phosphate and tannophospate of creosote; and creosotal and tanosal, tannates of creosote. Creosote and eucalptus oil were also a remedy used together, administered through a vaporizor and inhaler. Since then, more effective and safer treatments for tuberculosis have been developed.|$|R

Obteve-se o creosoto vegetal bruto por meio da destilação à temperatura de 110 - 255 ºC do alcatrão vegetal. Uma fração dos destilados foi lavada com solução a 9 % de bicarbonato de sódio, obtendo-se o creosoto vegetal purificado. Ambas as frações foram enriquecidas com 3 % de naftenato de cobre; 3 % de naftenato de zinco; 3 % naftenato de cobalto; 2 % de TBTO; 2 % de tribromofenato de tubutil-estanho; 2 % de pentaclorofenol; ou 0, 4 % de trióxido de arsênico. Foram preparadas 16 soluções, sendo 14 enriquecidas, além do creosoto vegetal bruto e do creosoto vegetal purificado. Estacas confeccionadas com madeira de alburno de Eucalyptus grandis foram tratadas pelo processo de célula- cheia (processo Bethell). Após o tratamento, parafusos auto-rosquéaveis de ferro zincado foram fixados às estacas. O ensaio foi instalado em três localidades da Zona da Mata de Minas Gerais (Viçosa, Ponte Nova e Leopoldina). A corrosividade das soluções de creosoto vegetal foi comparada à causada pelo creosoto mineral. As soluções preparadas com creosoto vegetal purificado foram menos corrosivas que suas similares preparadas com creosoto vegetal bruto, assemelhando-se ao creosoto mineral.

40|$|Bioavailability {{is often}} {{considered}} to be the rate limiting process in the bioremediation of sites contaminated with hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs). In order to meet the need for a direct measurement technique for microbial bioavailability, the whole-cell bioluminescent biosensor PpF 1 G 4 was developed. To create PpF 1 G 4, bioluminescent reporter genes (lux) were placed {{under the control of the}} promoter region of the solvent efflux pump genes (sep) in Pseudomonas putida F 1. In screening experiments, it was determined that biosensor PpF 1 G 4 produced a bioluminescent response to a wide range of aromatic compounds. PpF 1 G 4 was used to evaluate how three nonionic surfactants (Triton X- 100, Brij 30 and Brij 35) influence the bioavailability of three different HOCs (toluene, naphthalene, and phenanthrene). Nonionic surfactants were used because they are in general less toxic to bacteria. The increased bioluminescent response of PpF 1 G 4 in micellar solutions of Triton X- 100 and Brij 35 indicated higher intra-cellular concentrations of the test compounds, toluene, naphthalene and phenanthrene, compared to control systems with no surfactants present. In contrast, Brij 30 caused a decrease in the bioluminescent response to the test compounds. The effect of the micellar solutions on the toluene biodegradation rate was consistent with the bioluminescent response. Thus, the bioluminescent response of PpF 1 G 4 was an accurate indicator of bioavailability. The results suggest that nonionic surfactants enhance biodegradation in two ways: (1) by augmenting membrane permeability through binding of surfactant monomers; and (2) by increasing the mass flux of substrates present in the micellar pseudophase to the cells. PpF 1 G 4 was also employed to evaluate the bioavailability of HOCs partitioned from multicomponent NAPLs (gasoline, crude oil, and <b>creosote)</b> into surfactant <b>solutions.</b> All three surfactants tested increased the bioavailability of HOCs partitioned from creosote and crude oil. None of the surfactants significantly enhanced the response to gasoline-equilibrated solutions. The suppression of bioluminescence in Brij 30 solutions containing single test compounds did not occur in Brij 30 solutions containing multiple HOCs. This research sheds some light on how certain nonionic surfactants may increase the bioavailability of HOCs and thus enhance bioremediation...|$|R
