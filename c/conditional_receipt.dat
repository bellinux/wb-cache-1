40|$|Plaintiff Dolores Smith {{appealed from}} a {{judgment}} in a {{favor of the}} Westland Life Insurance Company after a nonjury trial. Mrs. Smith, as the widow and administratrix of the estate of her husband, sought recovery of $ 10, 000 under a temporary life insurance contract. Mr. Smith had paid the first month’s premium and received a <b>conditional</b> <b>receipt,</b> {{also known as a}} binder or a binding receipt, from a soliciting agent of Westland on April 8, 1963. However, due to the hazardous nature of Smith’s employment as a railroad laborer, Westland issued him a modified policy, with increased premiums, on April 24. Smith refused to accept the amended policy or to pay the additional premium to the soliciting agent. On May 17, Westland, through its general agent, again submitted the proposed policy to Mr. Smith. When he refused it, the general agent told him that his premium would be refunded. The following morning, Smith died in an automobile accident. The trial court concluded that the <b>conditional</b> <b>receipt</b> created a provisional contract granting temporary life insurance. The Supreme Court of California reversed the judgment. This Case Note argues that, based on the facts of this case, the final result reached by the Smith court is both equitable and fair. If the insurance company does not feel that an applicant is an insurable risk under the original terms of the insurance contract, it should bear the risk of making him clearly aware of that fact. Implicit in the return of premium rule is the broader mandate that notification be clear and unambiguous...|$|E

On November 13, 1998, Hansadutta agreed to a stipulated court settlement that effectively terminated any claims {{he might have had}} to being a trustee of the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust <b>conditional</b> upon <b>receipt</b> of an undisclosed cash settlement and license to publish the original, unrevised books of Bhaktivedanta Swami.|$|R

We analyse this differential by examining {{differences between the}} sexes both in private pension coverage and in pension income <b>conditional</b> on <b>receipt.</b> Using regression-based decompositions, we show that both gaps are associated mainly with gender differences in returns to personal characteristics rather than with gender differences in personal characteristics per se. In particular, although there are marked differences between elderly men and elderly women in their lifetime employment histories, these differences account for {{only a small fraction}} of the overall private pension income gap between the sexes. ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a unique}} set of {{questions}} in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 provides some direct evidence on the mechanism through which union coverage increases WC receipt.

30|$|<b>Conditional</b> on <b>receipt</b> of an {{aggregate}} benefit in the data, we utilise the following equations {{to simulate the}} disaggregated benefits. The first objective therefore is to estimate a series of statistical models relating entitlement to a disaggregated benefit {{as a function of}} the aggregate benefit. To disaggregate these variables into their benefit components, we utilise the fact that an earlier survey, the Living in Ireland Survey (LII) 1994 – 2001 contains disaggregated benefits. We estimate equations of benefit entitlement in the LII and use these estimates to simulate entitlement to disaggregated benefits in the SILC data. It is in effect a parametric statistical matching method. We based this relationship on demographic characteristics, existence of other incomes, labour market characteristics of the recipient and spouse.|$|R
30|$|In our view, {{this line}} of {{reasoning}} is more plausible for the lack of crowding out among SSS recipients who stay in larger flats. While the lack of crowding out among poorer SSS recipients may be {{due in part to the}} fact that fewer of them receive private cash transfers in the first place, this explanation is unlikely to be the only reason, since substantial proportions of those living in smaller flat-types (who receive the highest payouts) receive private cash transfers as well. For example, during the period before the announcement of SSS details, 26, 36, and 59 % of SSS recipients in one-, two-, three-room flats receive private cash transfers respectively monthly. <b>Conditional</b> on <b>receipt,</b> they receive monthly averages of S$ 693, S$ 434, and S$ 817. These statistics suggest that our finding of no effect on the receipt of private cash transfer can also be driven by a lack of response from “donors” to SSS recipients.|$|R
40|$|Although {{males and}} females may face severe sexual {{conflicts}} [1], the decision over who donates and who receives sperm is fixed. This {{is not necessarily the}} case in simultaneous hermaphrodites, where each mate may insist on copulating as ‘male,’ ‘female’ or both. The resulting conflicts over gender provide an opportunity to study conflict-solving strategies. By directly manipulating mating interests in the sea slug Chelidonura hirundinina, we present the first unequivocal evidence for ‘sperm trading’ [2], a mating strategy where sperm donation is <b>conditional</b> on sperm <b>receipt.</b> Trading enforces reciprocity, offering a simple solution for the gender conflict...|$|R
40|$|Conventional in-work {{benefits}} (IWB) are means-tested, open to {{all workers}} with sufficiently low income, and usually paid without a time-limit. This paper evaluates an IWB with an alternative design that was aimed at lone parents in the UK and piloted in {{one third of the}} country, and that featured a time-limit, and was paid <b>conditional</b> on previous <b>receipt</b> of welfare. It increased flows off welfare and into work, and these positive effects did not diminish when recipients reached the 12 month time-limit for receiving the supplement. Job retention of recipients was good, but this cannot be attributed to the IWB. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{pioneering}} 1973 CPS-IRS-SSA Exact Match Study (Kilss and Scheuren 1978), {{the use of}} linked data sets {{has been an important}} tool for analysts. Our current study is one of several recent efforts to improve understanding and usefulness of survey data matched to individual-level benefit records, and it is the first one involving actual payment histories from the Social Security Administration’s (SSA’s) Payment History Update System (PHUS) for Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI). The SSA administrative records have been matched to the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). In analyzing these matched data for elderly and working-age beneficiaries, we seek to identify specific factors primarily responsible for survey error and to assess the relevance of survey error for a range of different analytic objectives. In this paper we address the following major issues: The availability of and limitations of SIPP matched to SSA records Errors arising from the past use of payment eligibility record data The magnitude of SIPP error in receipt of OASDI benefits measured against record data on actual receipt The magnitude of SIPP error in estimating benefit amounts <b>conditional</b> on <b>receipt</b> measured against record data on actual receipt Reasons for SIPP error and analytic implications Finally, we comment on issues related to Social Security number (SSN) nonreporting, particularly in light of the fairly lo...|$|R
40|$|This study elaborates {{the concept}} of a {{positionally}} sensitive grammar with respect to the sequentiality of turns and the turn constructional units in conversation. The linguistic object of the analysis is clausal constructions in Swedish that are initiated by the finite predicate verb: polar questions, receipt questions (news <b>receipts),</b> <b>conditional</b> protases and pro-drop declaratives. These constructions share potentially the same syntactic surface pattern but are constrained by different sequential conditions of use. The study proposes an integrated interactional linguistic analysis which takes into account both syntactic and sequential aspects of turn construction. A grammatical attribute-value matrix, based on the framework of construction grammar (CxG), is introduced. The analysis shows that regularities of sequential organization may provide robust distinctive constructional features while a pure syntactic analysis remains less distinctive. The decisive constructional features are systematically captured by a notation designed for sequential and syntactic organization...|$|R
40|$|Conventional in-work {{benefits}} or tax credits are now well {{established as a}} policy instrument for increasing labour supply and tackling poverty. A different sort of in-work credit is one where the payments are time-limited, <b>conditional</b> on previous <b>receipt</b> of welfare, and, perhaps, not means-tested. Such a design is cheaper, and perhaps better targeted, but potentially less effective. Using administrative data, this paper evaluates one such policy for lone parents in the UK which was piloted in around {{one third of the}} country. It finds that the policy did increase flows off welfare and into work, and that these positive effects did not diminish after recipients reached the 12 month time-limit for receiving the supplement. Most of the impact arose by speeding up welfare off-flows: the job retention of programme recipients was good, but this cannot be attributed to the programme itself. In-work benefits, labour supply, time-limits, welfare, lone parents. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Vaccine safety scares can {{undermine}} {{public confidence}} in vaccines and decrease immunisation rates. Understanding and addressing parental concerns arising during such scares can assist in lessening their impact. In Australia in April 2010 there was a temporary suspension of influenza vaccine for children under 5  years of age after reports {{of an increase in}} the rate of adverse events following vaccination. This qualitative study aimed to explore the impact of the vaccine suspension on parental knowledge, attitudes, trust, information needs, and intent related to influenza vaccination and broader immunisation programs. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 parents of children attending childcare centres in Sydney, Australia, between June 2010 and May 2011. Centres were selected to include parents from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds. Interview transcripts were coded and analysed using an approach informed by grounded theory. Results Findings indicated that, for those who recalled the vaccine suspension, there was a lasting sense of uncertainty and confusion and a perceived lack of information. Parents had distinct information needs following the vaccine suspension, especially in regards to vaccine safety, testing and recommendations. For many, influenza vaccination intent was <b>conditional</b> on <b>receipt</b> of information from a trusted, authoritative source allaying safety concerns. Importantly, the impact of the scare was contained to influenza vaccines only, and not other vaccine programs. Conclusions Parental concerns and information gaps following a vaccine safety scare need to be actively addressed. We provide policy and practice suggestions for proactively managing such incidents, particularly in relation to communication of timely, targeted information to parents and immunisation providers...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold: first, on the {{normative}} level, the author compares three main ways of securing trust on imperfectly competitive markets – informal social enforcement, formal-third party enforcement, and conditional internal commitment to the cultural norm of trust, in terms of the standard criteria of allocative and adaptive efficiency. Admittedly, the three ways of securing trust in reality rarely exist separately and as ideal types, but the author separates them for the purpose of a normative analysis. The task of that analysis is to show that the system of <b>conditional</b> (upon the <b>receipt</b> of reciprocity) internal commitment to the cultural norm of trust is, on the normative level, the superior way of ensuring trust in terms of allocative efficiency in comparison with the other two ways (social enforcement, third-party enforcement). In terms of adaptive efficiency, the situation is more complicated as cultural belief systems change relatively slowly. The second purpose of the paper is to give a point of departure for the conceptualization of the emergence and stabilization of the system of internal commitment to trust. In that context the author uses the recent empirical and theoretic findings of indirect evolutionary approach to rationality...|$|R
40|$|In {{your letter}} dated September 16, 2008, you {{stated that the}} NRC staff has {{performed}} an acceptance review of the HFC- 6000 Safety System Topical Report and found that HFC has provided sufficient information to accept this TR and initiate the review. As discussed in your letter and our meeting held on August 19, 2008, your acceptance of this TR is <b>conditional</b> upon the <b>receipt</b> of additional information listed in your letter (Items 1 through 7) by September 30, 2008. The HFC response to these 7 items is provided in Enclosure 1. Enclosure 2 provides the additional proprietary information requested by the above items. This information should satisfy the {{request for additional information}} identified in your letter. You also stated that the NRC staff expects to issue its request for any further additional information by June 30, 2009, and issue its draft safety evaluation by December 4, 2009. We had hoped for a more expedient schedule and are willing to work closely with you to achieve this by providing rapid responses to all future requests for additional information and meetings. HFC suggests that future conference calls and/or technical meeting may improve communications and minimize a long list of topics in June, 2009.

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that a positive correlation exists between receiving welfare {{as a child and}} depending on welfare as an adult. However, previous studies {{have not been able to}} explore many aspects of this relationship. This paper uses a unique administrative dataset for California, which follows welfare recipients since their teenage years until early adulthood, to study the causal effects of different lengths of welfare exposure as a child (<b>conditional</b> on welfare <b>receipt)</b> on future welfare dependency as a young adult. The econometric analyses in this paper use a recently developed method from the program evaluation literature, based on the estimation of a generalized propensity score (GPS). As in the binary-treatment case the GPS permits removing the biases associated with differences in the observed characteristics of individuals. In addition, for some analyses, family-level unobserved heterogeneity is controlled for by relying on pairs of siblings exposed to different lengths of exposure. The results show that there is no causal effect of length of exposure on future welfare dependency, nor on teenage childbearing. Conditional on teenage childbearing, there are no effects of length of exposure on adult welfare dependency either, but this dependency is almost three times larger for teenage mothers than for non-mothers. All results hold when controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. The results indicate that policies like time-limits are not likely to reduce the intergenerational correlation of welfare dependency.

30|$|When {{it comes}} to welfare income we can compare the utility gain from an extra £ 1 of welfare {{entitlement}} (or an extra £ 1 of <b>receipt</b> <b>conditional</b> on programme participation), with an extra £ 1 of other income. For example, the effect of £ 1 of extra Family Credit entitlement is zero unless it triggers programme participation in which case it is 4.152 (= 4.474 - 0.3223) – which, in money metric terms, is approximately £ 0.93 (i.e. 4.152 / 4.474), which {{is what it is}} for those already taking up. The probability that it triggers programme participation is the marginal effect of entitlement of 0.03 (0.069 x 0.45, the take-up rate). Thus, the expected impact on someone not taking up is just 0.125 (3 % of 4.152), worth £ 0.03. The overall expected impact is 0.03 for the 55 % not taking up and 0.93 for those who are – on average an effect of approximately £ 0.44. Similarly £ 1 of child nutrition has no effect unless it triggers programme participation in which case the effect is 3.9 – in money metric terms approximately £ 0.87, which is what it is for those already taking up. While the expected impact is just 0.25 (6 % of 3.9) – which, in money metric terms, is approximately £ 0.06 for someone not taking up. Therefore, the overall average effect, across the 15 % who are not taking up and the 85 % who are, is £ 0.74. Importantly, our results indicate that Family Credit is valued less than child nutrition programmes.|$|R
40|$|This work {{consists}} of four seemingly independent research tasks, using the British Household Panel Survey. Firstly, we endeavour to ascertain the impact of personal characteristics {{on the concept of}} Job Mobility with respect to Hour Constraints. Descriptive evidence suggests that almost 40 % of British employees are not happy with their working hours. Whether this fact can stimulate job mobility is of our primary interest. We then focus on job satisfaction in attempt to isolate those parameters that can have a decisive effect on it. We exploit a series of subjectively measured covariates in order to tackle unobserved heterogeneity and handle the issue of interpersonal judgements in a more consistent way. Additionally, we estimate job satisfaction profiles to see if the pattern of job satisfaction is different between those employees who changed job and those who did not. The third empirical chapter examines the issues of earnings profiles between the private and the public sector. We argue that the motivational basis for choosing either sector is fundamentally different and this fact should {{have an impact on the}} relevant earnings profiles. Public sector workers are expected to exchange a flatter earnings profile for non-pecuniary aspects of their job, including the satisfaction with the work it self. Finally, we look at the probability of becoming self-employed, <b>conditional</b> upon the <b>receipt</b> of a windfall and the consideration of social capital variables. We want to see if the inclusion of the latter can have any impact on the predicting power of windfalls, given that recent research highlighted the relationship between social capital variables and the probability of receiving a windfall.

40|$|The main aim of {{labour market}} {{activation}} policies {{is to bring}} jobless people from unemployment or inactivity into work or, at the very least, to influence the employment prospects of the unemployed positively. Activation schemes typically make benefit <b>receipt</b> <b>conditional</b> upon job search activities, acceptance of available job offers and participation in training activities. This article addresses the appropriate role of the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) {{in the establishment of}} activation in South Africa. It focuses on a number of principled and practical considerations and constraints that challenge the use of activation mechanisms, such as the fragmentation of the existing legal and institutional frameworks, the lack of available employment opportunities and human rights considerations. It is argued that the limited and short-term impact of the UIF, its strong labour-market orientation and its inability to appropriately contribute to preventing and combating unemployment or to reintegrate the unemployed into the labour market all point to the urgent need to reform the UIF. The gaps in the current unemployment insurance system are highlighted, as is the need to enhance the relationship between the unemployment insurance system and (appropriate) activation measures. The role of existing social security and employment creation initiatives in this dynamic is also considered. In particular, the absence of a link between those excluded from the UIF and the activation mechanisms introduced by the Skills Development Act 97 of 1998 is underscored. Proposals contained in the Employment Services Bill are also evaluated. It is suggested that an expanded form of employment services provision, incorporating a network of labour centres, ought to receive prioritisation in the South African context. This must be coupled with a move to consolidate the various available governmental databases in terms of which unemployed persons may register as job-seekers. The creation of an enabling framework to achieve such goals would require a variety of legislative changes, some of which are discussed in the article...|$|R
