40|$|ABSTRACT (Continue on reverse if {{necessary}} and identify by block number) A theoretical study and computer {{analysis of the}} cathode spot of a unipolar arc was conducted. The underlying theories of Plasma Physics, 4 'Pace <b>Carge</b> Effects, and /liectron Lmission needed for an understanding of cathode phenomena are presented. Two models of unipolar arcing are reviewed and {{an analysis of the}} cathode spot is begun. A stationary model of the cathode spot is formulated with a system of equations that is not closed. A method of solution, using the Steenbeck Minimum Principle, is- ' 4 1 ized and a computer program developed t...|$|E

The aim is the investigation of the interaction of fast heavy ions with hot matter in terms energy loss and <b>carge</b> state measurements. The essential plasma parameters of the Z-pinch target are the electron density and the plasma temperature. They are measured with the following methods: - time resolved optical spectroscopy of the light emitted by the hydrogen plasma - holographic interferometry in transverse direction (with respect to the symmetry axis of the plasma pinch) - time resolved Mach-Zehnder interferometry in axial direction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Destructive {{physical}} {{analysis of the}} discharge and neutralizer hollow cathode assemblies from the Deep Space 1 Flight Spare 30, 000 Hr life test was performed to characterize physical and chemical evidence of operationally induced effects after 30, 372 hours of operation with beam extraction. Post-test inspection of the discharge-cathode assembly was subdivided into detailed analyses at the subcomponent level. Detailed materials analysis and optical inspection of the insert, orifice plate, cathode tube, heater, keeper assembly, insulator, and low-voltage propellant isolator were performed. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEW analyses {{were used to determine}} the extent and composition of regions of net deposition and erosion of both the discharge and neutralizer inserts. A comparative approach with an un-operated 4 :l:l insert was used {{to determine the extent of}} impregnate material depletion as a function of depth from the ID surface and axial position from the orifice plate. Analysis results are compared and contrasted with those obtained from similar analyses on components from shorter term tests, and provide insight regarding the prospect for successful longer-term operation consistent with SOA ion engine program life objectives at NASA. barium depletion depth insert temperature coefficient relating depletion rate to insert temperature saturation current electron <b>carge</b> Boltzmann's constant time step inner diameter scanning electron miscoscope energy-dispersive Xray throttle level I...|$|E

40|$|We study {{properties}} of Wigner crystal in snaked nanochannels {{and show that}} they are characterized by a conducting sliding phase at low charge densities and an insulating pinned phase emerging above a certain critical charge density. We trace parallels between this model problem and the Little suggestion for electron transport in organic molecules. We also show that in presence of periodic potential inside the snaked channel the sliding phase exists only inside a certain window of electron densities that has similarities with a pressure dependence of conductivity in organic conductors. Our studies show emergence of dynamical glassy phase in a purely periodic potential in absence of any disorder that can explain enormously slow variations of resistivity in organic conductors. Finally we discuss the KAM concept of superfluidity induced by repulsive Coulomb interaction between electrons. We argue that the transition from the sliding KAM phase to the pinned Aubry phase corresponds to the superfluid-insulator transition.

40|$|Introduction Engineering {{programs}} which compute electrostatic capacitances for complicated arrangements of conductors commonly {{set up the}} electrostatic potential u as a superposition of surface <b>carges</b> a u(x) = /s G(x, y) o'(y) dS(y). where G(x, y) [...] - 1 / 4 rlx - y[is the Green's function for the Laplacian in the three-space. For a specified potential on the conductor surface(s) S, this ap- proach leads to an integral equation of the first kind on S for the charge density a. The capacitance is the net-charge on the conductors and is given by the surface integral of a. It is standard to discretize this integral equation with a collocation scheme. The resulting linear system is dense and can be large for complex geometries of S. In the recent past, {{there has been a}} major progress to sparsify this system with the fast multipole method. As a result the matrix vector product can be carried out in O(N) operations and thus the solution of the linearrsystem with an itergtive scheme like GMRE...|$|R
5000|$|The initial line-up was Mike Levy (vocals, bass) and Matt <b>Carges</b> (guitar) adding English drummer Daniel Swan, {{formerly}} of The Cortinas by 1986. The band showed influences {{from the likes}} of The Zombies, The Left Banke and The Easybeats, all of whom had tracks covered by The Sneetches. They signed to the London-based Kaleidoscope Sound label, and debuted in 1987 with [...] "Only For a Moment", followed by the mini-album Lights Out! With The Sneetches. They were then signed by Creation Records in the UK and Alias Records in the United States, who issued the band's debut full-length album, Sometimes That's All We Have, in 1989, described by Allmusic as [...] "a masterful album highly recommended to all fans of the style". Levy switched to guitar with the recruitment of former Sting-Ray Alejandro [...] "Alec" [...] Palao in 1988. Slow followed on Alias in 1990, the band then moving on to the Bus Stop label for three singles between 1991 and 1993, later compiled on the Think Again compilation.|$|R
5000|$|The film explores {{adolescent}} issues {{through the}} minds of three friends and their reactions after a boy named Rudy <b>Carges</b> (Conor Donovan) is killed in a tree house set on fire by local bullies Jeff and Kenny, who carelessly didn't find out he was inside until too late. The boy's twin brother Jacob, {{a boy with a}} huge birthmark (also played by Donovan), decides to seek revenge against the bullies. Leonard (Jesse Camacho) who's overweight, survives the tree house fire but loses his sense of taste and smell. Thanks to the fire, this prompts Leonard to go on a diet, which isn't welcomed by his obese family. The boys' female friend Malee (Zoe Weizenbaum) tries to befriend an adult named Gus (Jeremy Renner), a grief-stricken patient of her therapist mother, Carla (Annabella Sciorra). Jacob's family falls apart {{after the death of his}} brother. But shortly after, his parents adopt a boy named Keith Gardner. Meanwhile, Malee begins to have a crush on Gus and changes the song for her recital to one Gus liked, just for him. As time goes by, she sees Gus as her [...] "soul mate". She sneaks into his house one night to find him grieving. Afraid to confront him, Malee steals his gun and leaves. She gives it to Jacob the following day.|$|R
