5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines <b>circulating</b> <b>water</b> or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E

50|$|A forced {{circulation}} boiler is a boiler where a pump {{is used to}} <b>circulate</b> <b>water</b> inside the boiler. This differs from a natural circulation boiler which relies on current density to <b>circulate</b> <b>water</b> inside the boiler. In some {{forced circulation}} boilers, the <b>water</b> is <b>circulated</b> twenty {{times the rate of}} evaporation.|$|R
5000|$|Circulating pump: It is {{designed}} to <b>circulate</b> <b>water</b> back to the boiler after it has expelled some of its heat.|$|R

25|$|In 1884, John J. Montgomery, an American {{trained in}} physics, began experimenting with glider designs. Using a water table with <b>circulating</b> <b>water</b> and a smoke chamber he began {{applying}} {{the physics of}} fluid dynamics to describe the motions of flow over curved surfaces such as airfoils. In 1889, Charles Renard, a French aeronautical engineer, became {{the first person to}} reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight. Renard and German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz explored the wing loading (weight to wing-area ratio) of birds, eventually concluding that humans could not fly under their own power by attaching wings onto their arms. Otto Lilienthal, following the work of Sir George Cayley, {{was the first person to}} become highly successful with glider flights. Lilienthal believed that thin, curved airfoils would produce high lift and low drag.|$|E
25|$|Measures {{creating}} uniform wastewater loadings tend {{to reduce}} the probability of upsets. Fixed-film or attached growth secondary treatment bioreactors are similar to a plug flow reactor model <b>circulating</b> <b>water</b> over surfaces colonized by biofilm, while suspended-growth bioreactors resemble a continuous stirred-tank reactor keeping microorganisms suspended while water is being treated. Secondary treatment bioreactors may {{be followed by a}} physical phase separation to remove biological solids from the treated water. Upset duration of fixed film secondary treatment systems may be longer because of the time required to recolonize the treatment surfaces. Suspended growth ecosystems may be restored from a population reservoir. Activated sludge recycle systems provide an integrated reservoir if upset conditions are detected in time for corrective action. Sludge recycle may be temporarily turned off to prevent sludge washout during peak storm flows when dilution keeps BOD concentrations low. Suspended growth activated sludge systems can be operated in a smaller space than fixed-film trickling filter systems that treat the same amount of water; but fixed-film systems are better able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.|$|E

During trials on Loch Lomond in June 1937 the engine was [...] "slightly damaged... because of trouble with the <b>circulating</b> <b>water</b> system".

50|$|Cryotherapy is a {{very old}} form of pain relief. It is the {{treatment}} of pain and inflammation by reducing the skin temperature, and it can also significantly reduce swelling. For shoulder arthritis, cryotherapy is a sling that would fit over the shoulder and, {{with the use of}} a hand pump to <b>circulate</b> <b>water,</b> would keep the affected area cool.|$|R
2500|$|Draw-off or Blow-down — The {{portion of}} the <b>circulating</b> <b>water</b> flow that is removed (usually {{discharged}} to a drain) {{in order to maintain}} the amount of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and other impurities at an acceptably low level. [...] Higher TDS concentration in solution may result from greater cooling tower efficiency. However the higher the TDS concentration, the greater the risk of scale, biological growth and corrosion. The amount of blow-down is primarily designated by measuring by the electrical conductivity of the <b>circulating</b> <b>water.</b> Biological growth, scaling and corrosion can be prevented by chemicals (respectively, biocide, sulfuric acid, corrosion inhibitor). On the other hand, the only practical way to decrease the electrical conductivity is by increasing the amount of blow-down discharge and subsequently increasing the amount of clean make-up water.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{applications}} include cooling the <b>circulating</b> <b>water</b> used in oil refineries, petrochemical {{and other}} [...] chemical plants, thermal power stations and HVAC systems for cooling buildings.

2500|$|Treated timber — A {{structural}} material for cooling towers which was largely abandoned about 10 years ago.

The life of treated timber varies a lot, depending on the operating conditions of the tower, such as frequency of shutdowns, treatment of the <b>circulating</b> <b>water,</b> etc. Under proper working conditions, the estimated life of treated timber structural members is about 10 years.|$|E
50|$|A {{centrifugal}} pump which forms {{the heart of}} this boiler is responsible to <b>circulate</b> <b>water</b> within the boiler system.

2500|$|In {{industrial}} water treatment applications where galvanic corrosion {{is a potential}} due to bimetallic construction, the application of sodium molybdate is preferred over sodium nitrite. [...] Sodium molybdate has the advantage in that the dosing of lower ppm's of molybdate allow for lower conductivity of the <b>circulating</b> <b>water.</b> [...] Sodium molybdate at levels of 50-100 ppm offer the same levels of corrosion inhibition that sodium nitrite at levels of 800+ ppm. [...] By utilizing lower concentrations of sodium molybdate, conductivity is kept at a minimum and thus galvanic corrosion potentials are decreased.|$|E
2500|$|The Chaplin's patent distilling {{apparatus}} with Steam pump for <b>circulating</b> <b>water</b> attached was {{an early}} design of an evaporator, a device for producing fresh water on board ship by distillation of seawater. An example of this apparatus has been recovered from the wreck of [...] (1872), an auxiliary steamship used in Australia to transport passengers and trade goods before ultimately sinking in Port Gregory, Western Australia in 1872.

Chaplins' produced a range of steam powered industrial products including steam cranes, hoists, locomotives, pumping and winding engines, ship's deck engines and sea water distilling apparatus, used throughout the world during the 19th and 20th century. Chaplin's patent sea water distilling apparatus with steam pump attached for <b>circulating</b> <b>water</b> was a very compact and convenient apparatus, designed for marine use but capable of adaptation for land use as well.|$|E
50|$|Later {{geothermal}} heat pumps designs started incorporating an additional plastic pipe loop to <b>circulate</b> <b>water</b> in deep wells {{in an effort}} to gather sufficient heat for large industrial applications, such as cement plants.

25|$|With cooling towers, a {{hyperbolic}} {{structure is}} preferred. At the bottom, the widening {{of the tower}} provides a large area for installation of fill to promote thin film evaporative cooling of the <b>circulated</b> <b>water.</b> As the water first evaporates and rises, the narrowing effect helps accelerate the laminar flow, and then as it widens out, contact between the heated air and atmospheric air supports turbulent mixing.|$|R
2500|$|Industrial {{cooling towers}} {{can be used}} to remove heat from various sources such as {{machinery}} or heated process material. [...] The primary use of large, industrial cooling towers is to remove the heat absorbed in the circulating cooling water systems used in power plants, petroleum refineries, petrochemical plants, natural gas processing plants, food processing plants, semi-conductor plants, and for other industrial facilities such as in condensers of distillation columns, for cooling liquid in crystallization, etc. The circulation rate of cooling water in a typical 700 MW coal-fired power plant with a cooling tower amounts to about 71,600 cubic metres an hour (315,000 US gallons per minute) and the <b>circulating</b> <b>water</b> requires a supply water make-up rate of perhaps 5 percent (i.e., 3,600 cubic metres an hour).|$|E

The 3 MW (thermal) {{boiling water reactor}} (BWR) used 93.20% highly enriched uranium fuel. It operated with natural circulation, using light water as a coolant (vs. heavy water) and moderator. ANL used its experience from the BORAX experiments to design the BWR. The <b>circulating</b> <b>water</b> system operated at [...] flowing through fuel plates of uranium-aluminum alloy. The plant {{was turned over to}} the U.S. Army in December 1958 after extensive testing, with Combustion Engineering acting as the lead contractor beginning in February 1959.

2500|$|The primary {{disadvantage}} of single shaft combined cycle power plants {{is that the}} number of steam turbines, condensers and condensate systems – and perhaps the number of cooling towers and <b>circulating</b> <b>water</b> systems – increases to match the number of gas turbines. For a multi-shaft combined cycle power plant there is only one steam turbine, condenser {{and the rest of the}} heat sink for up to three gas turbines; only their size increases. Having only one large steam turbine and heat sink results in low cost because of economies of scale. [...] A larger steam turbine also allows the use of higher pressures and results in a more efficient steam cycle. Thus the overall plant size and the associated number of gas turbines required have a major impact on whether a single shaft combined cycle power plant or a multiple shaft combined cycle power plant is more economical.|$|E
