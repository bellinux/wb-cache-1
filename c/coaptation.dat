60|$|The Tempest is a {{specimen}} of the purely romantic drama, {{in which the}} interest is not historical, or dependent upon fidelity of portraiture, or the natural connection of events, but is a birth of the imagination, and rests only upon the <b>coaptation</b> and union of the elements granted to, or assumed by, the poet. It is a species of drama which owes no allegiance to time or space, and in which, therefore, errors of chronology and geography—no mortal sins in any species—are venial faults, and count for nothing. It addresses itself entirely to the imaginative faculty; and although the illusion may be assisted by {{the effect on the}} senses of the complicated scenery and decorations of modern times, yet this sort of assistance is dangerous. For the principal and only genuine excitement ought to come from within—from the moved and sympathetic imagination; whereas, where so much is addressed to the mere external senses of seeing and bearing, the spiritual vision is apt to languish, and the attraction from without will withdraw the mind from the proper and only legitimate interest which is intended to spring from within.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES The aim was {{to define}} the 3 -dimensional (3 D) {{geometrical}} changes of the aortic root and to determine the local shear stress profile of aortic root elements during the cardiac cycle. METHODS Six sonomicrometric crystals (200 Hz) were implanted into the aortic root of five pigs at the commissures and at the aortic root base (AoB). 3 D aortic root deformation including volume, torsion and tilt angle were determined. Geometrical data with measured local flow and pressure conditions was used for computed fluid dynamics modelling of the aortic root. RESULTS Compared with end-diastole, the sinotubular junction and AoB have maximal expansion at peak ejection: 16. 42 ± 6. 36 and 7. 60 ± 2. 52 %, and minimal at isovolaemic relaxation: 2. 87 ± 1. 62 and 1. 85 ± 1. 79 %. Aortic root tilt and rotation angle were maximal {{at the end of}} diastole: 17. 7 ± 8. 8 and 21. 2 ± 2. 09 °, and decreased to 15. 24 ± 8. 14 and 18. 3 ± 0. 1. 94 ° at peak ejection. High shear stress > 20 Pa was registered at peak ejection at <b>coaptations,</b> and during diastole at the superior two-thirds of the leaflets and intervalvular triangles (IVTs). The leaflet body, inferior one-third of the IVTs and valve nadir were exposed to moderate shear stress (8 - 16 Pa) during the cardiac cycle. CONCLUSIONS Aortic root geometry demonstrates precise 3 D changes of tilt and rotation angle. Reduction of angles during ejection results in a straight cylinder with low shear stress that facilitates the ejection; the increase during diastole results in a tilted frustum with elevated shear stress. Findings can be used for comparative analysis of native and synthetic structures with individual compliance...|$|R
5000|$|The goal of {{mitral valve}} annuloplasty is to regain mitral valve {{competence}} by restoring the physiological {{form and function}} of the normal mitral valve apparatus. Under normal conditions the mitral valve undergoes significant dynamic changes in shape and size throughout the cardiac cycle. These changes are primarily due to the dynamic motion of the surrounding mitral valve annulus, a collageneous structure which attaches the mitral leaflets and the left atrium to the ostium of the left ventricle and the aortic root. Throughout the cardiac cycle, the annulus undergoes a sphincter motion, narrowing down the orifice area during systole to facilitate <b>coaptation</b> of the two leaflets and widens during diastole to allow for easy diastolic filling of the left ventricle. This motion is further enhanced by a pronounced three-dimensional configuration during systole, the characteristic saddle shape. These changes throughout the cycle {{are believed to be}} key to optimize leaflet <b>coaptation</b> [...] and to minimize tissue stresses.The challenge of mitral valve annuloplasty is to improve the diseased and distorted shape of the mitral valve and to reestablish the physiological configuration, while preserving normal annular dynamics. Today, cardiac surgeons can select from a variety of annuloplasty devices, flexible, semi-rigid, or rigid, incomplete or complete, planar or saddle-shaped, adjustable and non-adjustable. While the general goal of all devices is the same, namely to increase leaflet <b>coaptation</b> and to support the posterior annulus against dilation, flexible bands are designed to maintain the three-dimensional contour of the native annulus and some of its natural dynamics. The goal of semi-rigid rings is to maintain <b>coaptation</b> and valve integrity during systole, while allowing for good hemodynamics during diastole. Rigid rings are designed to provide rigid support in large dilation and under high-pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Mitral valve annuloplasty is a {{surgical}} technique for the repair of leaking mitral valves. Due to various factors, the two leaflets normally involved in sealing the mitral valve to retrograde flow may not [...] properly. Surgical repair typically involves the implantation of a device surrounding the mitral valve, called an annuloplasty device, which pulls the leaflets together to facilitate <b>coaptation</b> and aids to re-establish mitral valve function.|$|E
50|$|After {{the nerve}} is repaired, {{whether it is}} by using an {{autograft}} or an allograft, wallerian degeneration will be seen distal to the <b>coaptation.</b> This means that {{the part of the}} nerve that lies distal to the breaking point starts dissolving.

5000|$|Stenosis and insufficiency/regurgitation {{represent}} the dominant functional and anatomic consequences associated with valvular heart disease. Irrespective of disease process, alterations to the valve occur that produce {{one or a}} combination of these conditions. Insufficiency and regurgitation are synonymous terms that describe an inability of the valve to prevent backflow of blood as leaflets of the valve fail to join (<b>coaptation)</b> correctly. Stenosis is characterized by a narrowing of the valvular orifice that prevents adequate outflow of blood. Stenosis can also result in insufficiency if thickening of the annulus or leaflets results in inappropriate leaf closure.|$|E
50|$|During a one-stage or {{two-stage}} CFNG procedure, {{one or more}} non-affected {{facial nerve}} branches are used for reinnervation of the paralysed side. In the one stage procedure a free muscle transplant with a latissimus dorsi graft or a nerve graft (using the sural nerve or saphenous nerve) can be used. The latissimus dorsi graft is used because of its long thoracodorsal nerve. Therefore, it can be coapted directly to the normal functioning facial nerve. The one stage CFNG, implies an end-to-side <b>coaptation</b> of the sural or saphenous nerve to the distal end of the affected facial nerve. In the two-stage procedure, an incision {{in front of the}} ear is made on the non-paralysed side. Upon electrical stimulation, the nerve which produces the best contraction of the zygomatic muscles (and so the appearance of a smile) is selected. This branch is then sectioned. The sural or saphenous nerve as cross facial nerve graft is coapted to this unaffected branch of the facial nerve and tunnelled across the face to the paralysed side through a subcutaneous tunnel. The end of the graft is positioned in front of the tragus (cartilage in front of the ear) on the paralysed side. Nine to twelve months is needed for axonal regeneration in the cross facial nerve graft, because the result of damaged nerve tissue is loss of structure and axonal function. Degeneration appears distally in the paralysed facial nerve but this takes time, this process is called Wallerian degeneration. During the second stage end-to-side or end-to-end nerve <b>coaptation</b> to the proximal end of the paralysed facial nerve is performed with a microscope. And a free muscle transplant is placed, if indicated.|$|E
50|$|Schistosomes, {{unlike other}} trematodes, {{are long and}} slim worms. The male S. mansoni is {{approximately}} 1 cm long (0.6-1.1 cm) and is 0.1 cm wide. It is white, {{and it has a}} funnel-shaped oral sucker at its anterior end followed by a second pediculated sucker. The external part of the worm is composed of a double bilayer, which is continuously renewed as the outer layer, known as the membranocalyx, and is shed continuously. The tegument bears a large number of small tubercules. The suckers have small thorns in their inner part {{as well as in the}} buttons around them. The male genital apparatus is composed of 6 to 9 testicular masses, situated dorsally. There is one deferent canal beginning at each testicle, which is connected to a single deferent that dilates into a reservatory, the seminal vesicle, located at the beginning of the gynacophoric canal. The copula happens through the <b>coaptation</b> of the male and female genital orifices.|$|E
50|$|Based on the {{preference}} of the surgeon, the gracilis muscle, latissimus dorsi muscle, or pectoralis minor muscle {{are used as}} free neurovascular grafts. The gracilis muscle is mostly used free neurovascular muscle, {{because it has a}} reliable anatomy and is relatively simple to harvest. In addition, it can be trimmed for the correct size and volume with preservation of superior contraction qualities compared to bipennate muscles, because the gracilis is a parallel-fibered or strap muscle. Another advantage is the possibility for simultaneous dissection by a second team while the first team is preparing the face for the free muscle transplant.Another option for a free muscle transfer is the latissimus dorsi muscle. A disadvantage is that it can only be harvested with the patient in lateral decubitus or prone position. Therefore, the patient has to be turned during the operation. Advantages of the latissimus dorsi muscle are its reliable anatomy and relatively simple dissection. Analogue to the gracilis muscle, this muscle can be trimmed to the correct size and volume. The latissimus dorsi muscle is also a parallel-fibered muscle. Its long neurovascular bundle makes a one-stage facial reanimation without a CFNG possible. By using the long thoracodorsal nerve of the latissimus dorsi muscle, direct <b>coaptation</b> to the facial nerve on the other side can be performed.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{degree of}} mitral valve (MV) <b>coaptation</b> {{should be an}} {{important}} parameter {{in the assessment of}} functional mitral regurgitation (MR). This study aimed to quantify the degree of MV <b>coaptation</b> in experimental models of functional MR caused by acute left ventricular (LV) pressure overload, using real-time three-dimensional (3 D) echocardiography. Methods and resultsUsing canine models, LV pressure overload was induced by staged ascending aortic banding. Echocardiographic examinations were performed before and during the aortic banding. By using a novel software system for 3 D quantification (REALVIEW®), the annulus and leaflet were traced manually both at the onset of MV closure and at the maximum MV closure. The <b>coaptation</b> index was calculated by the following formula: [(3 D tenting surface area at the onset of MV closure- 3 D tenting surface area at the maximum MV closure) / 3 D tenting surface area at the onset of MV closure]× 100. MR area gradually increased with the decrease in <b>coaptation</b> index during progressively exacerbated aortic banding. MR area was significantly correlated with the <b>coaptation</b> index. A <b>coaptation</b> index < 12 had a high sensitivity and specificity in the presence of significant MR. ConclusionsThe degree of MV <b>coaptation</b> can be quantified using 3 D echocardiography.

Planimetric measurements of this area were performed on cross-sectional views of the aortic valve at 75 % phase of the cardiac cycle. Planimetric measurement of central regurgitation orifice area (ROA) seen in patients with aortic regurgitation and Hounsfield units of the central aortic valve <b>coaptation</b> area were performed. Mean area of the central aortic valve <b>coaptation</b> area was 5. 34  ±  5. 19  mm 2 and Hounsfield units in this area were 123. 69  ±  31. 31  HU.

40|$|Background. Current repair {{results for}} ischemic mitral {{regurgitation}} (IMR) with undersized annuloplasty rings {{are characterized by}} high IMR recurrence rates. Current annuloplasty rings treat annular dilatation, but they do little to improve (and may actually exacerbate) leaflet tethering. New saddle-shaped annuloplasty rings {{have been shown to}} maintain or restore a more physiologic annular and leaflet geometry and function. Using a porcine IMR model, we sought to demonstrate the influence of annuloplasty ring shape on leaflet <b>coaptation.</b> Methods. Eight weeks after posterolateral infarct, eight pigs with grade 2 D or higher IMR were randomized to undergo either a 28 -mm flat ring annuloplasty (n= 4) or a 28 -mm saddle-shaped ring annuloplasty (n= 4). Realtime three-dimensional echocardiography and a customized image analysis protocol allowed three-dimensional assessment of leaflet <b>coaptation</b> before and after annuloplasty. Results. Total leaflet <b>coaptation</b> area was significantly higher after saddle-shaped ring annuloplasty (109. 6 +/- 26. 9 mm(2)) compared with flat ring annuloplasty (46. 2 +/- 7. 7 mm(2), p < 0. 01). After annuloplasty, total <b>coaptation</b> area decreased by 87. 5 mm(2) (or 65 %) in the flat annuloplasty group (p = 0. 01), whereas total <b>coaptation</b> area increased by 22. 2 mm(2) (or 25 %) in the saddle-shaped annuloplasty group (p = 0. 28). Conclusions. This study shows that the use of undersized saddle-shaped annuloplasty rings in mitral valve repair for IMR improves leaflet <b>coaptation,</b> whereas the use of undersized flat annuloplasty rings worsens leaflet <b>coaptation.</b> Because one of Carpentier's fundamental principles of mitral valve repair (durability) is to create a large surface of <b>coaptation,</b> saddle-shaped annuloplasty may increase repair durability.

40|$|Background—Using human MV models {{derived from}} {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) echocardiography, {{finite element analysis}} (FEA) was used to predict mechanical leaflet and chordal stress. Subsequently, valve geometries were altered {{to examine the effects}} on stresses of: (1) varying <b>coaptation</b> area, (2) varying non-coapted leaflet tissue area, and (3) varying interleaflet coefficient of friction (μ). Methods—Three human MV models were loaded with a transvalvular pressure of 80 mmHg using FEA. Initially leaflet <b>coaptation</b> was set to 10 %, 50 %, or 100 % of actual <b>coaptation</b> length to test the influence of <b>coaptation</b> length on stress distribution. Next, leaflet surface areas were augmented by 1 % overall and by 2 % in the noncoapted “belly ” region to test the influence of increased leaflet billowing without changing the gross geometry of the MV. Finally, the coefficient of friction between the coapted leaflets was set to μ = 0, 0. 05, or 0. 3, to assess the influence of friction on MV function. Results—Leaflet <b>coaptation</b> length did not affect stress distribution in either the coapted or noncoapted leaflet regions: peak leaflet stress was 0. 36 ± 0. 17 MPa at 100 %, 0. 35 ± 0. 14 MPa a...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{sought to}} determine the feasibility of a novel mitral ring designed to reshape mitral annulus on beating heart, after surgery. The mitral ring is intended to improve mitral leaflets <b>coaptation</b> to correct residual and recurrent mitral regurgitations. It could also provide progressive correction of mitral regurgitation. The device was tested in ex vivo beating heart model. The novel mitral ring is selectively deformable in P 1, P 2 and P 3 segments using a dedicated angioplasty-type balloon. The deformation should increase leaflets' <b>coaptation</b> reducing distance between the two leaflets. It was implanted using standard surgical techniques. The mock-loop is based on passive beating heart. MV functioning was evaluated in terms of leaflet <b>coaptation</b> height at P 2 level using epicardial echocardiography. The test has been completed on 8 swine hearts. Ring size was 30 mm. The balloons were inserted in the connecting line. Each segment of the posterior annulus was independently activated over 3 progressive positions. Balloon inflation pressures were between 15 and 21 bar. Maximum <b>coaptation</b> height increase was 7 [*]mm. Mean pressure gradient across the MV was 1. 7 [*]±[*] 0. 3 mmHg post complete activation of the device. The device allowed significant increase in <b>coaptation</b> height at P 2 level after adjustments at P 1, P 2 and P 3. Results were consistent and reproducible.

Reactive gliosis and microglial reaction decreased in the same groups (AX+FS, AX+CFS) at 4 weeks. Regarding axonal regeneration, <b>coaptation</b> allowed recovery of greater number of myelinated fibers, with improved morphometric parameters.

40|$|ObjectiveThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the influence of the aortic annulus (AA) diameter in order to examine the performance metrics, such as maximum principal stress, strain energy density, <b>coaptation</b> area, and effective height in the aortic valve. MethodsSix cases of aortic roots with an AA diameter of 20 and 30 mm were numerically modeled. The <b>coaptation</b> height and area were calculated from 3 -dimensional fluid structure interaction models of the aortic valve and root. The structural model included flexible cusps in a compliant aortic root with material properties similar to the physiologic values. The fluid dynamics model included blood hemodynamics under physiologic diastolic pressures of the left ventricle and ascending aorta. Furthermore, zero flow was assumed for effective height calculations, similar to clinical measurements. In these no-flow models, the cusps were loaded with a transvalvular pressure decrease. All other parameters were identical to the fluid structure interaction models. ResultsThe aortic valve models with an AA diameter range of 20 to 26 mm were fully closed, and those with an AA diameter range of 28 to 30 mm were only partially closed. Increasing the AA diameter from 20 to 30 mm decreased the averaged <b>coaptation</b> height and normalized cusp <b>coaptation</b> area from 3. 3 to 0. 3 mm and from 27 % to 2. 8 %, respectively. Increasing the AA diameter from 20 to 30 mm decreased the effective height from 10. 9 to 8. 0 mm.

MethodsEchocardiograms demonstrating severe cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction ≤ 30 %) were retrospectively examined for left ventricular false tendons. The ejection fraction, cause of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular diastolic dimensions, severity of mitral regurgitation, mitral annular diameter, mitral valve <b>coaptation</b> depth, mitral valve <b>coaptation</b> area, and orientation of false tendon were evaluated. The patients with false tendons were compared with a control group with cardiomyopathy without false tendons. ResultsA cohort of patients (n = 82) with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (mean ejection fraction, 21 %) and false tendons were compared with a control group with similar left ventricular dysfunction and no false tendons (n = 121; mean ejection fraction, 20 %; P =. 10). The patients with false tendons had similar left ventricular diastolic internal dimensions compared with the control group (5. 99 and 6. 18 cm, respectively; P =. 086). Yet patients with false tendons had a very low incidence of severe functional mitral regurgitation compared with the control group (4. 9 % vs 27 %, P <. 001). Patients with false tendons had significantly smaller mitral annular diameters (3. 57 vs 4. 03 cm, P <. 001), shorter mitral valve <b>coaptation</b> depths (0. 89 vs 1. 24 cm, P <. 001), and reduced <b>coaptation</b> areas (1. 61 vs 2. 52 cm 2, P <. 001) than the control group.

To {{examine the effect of}} aortic root dilatation and increased elastic modulus on leaflet stress, strain, and <b>coaptation,</b> we used a finite-element model. Methods: The normal model incorporated the geometry, tissue thickness, and anisotropic elastic moduli of normal human roots and valves. Four Marfan models were evaluated, in which the diameter of the aortic root was dilated by 5 %, 15 %, 30 %, and 50 %. Aortic root elastic modulus in the 4 Marfan models was doubled. Under diastolic pressure, regional stresses and strains were evaluated, and the percentage of leaflet <b>coaptation</b> was calculated. Results: Root dilatation and stiffening significantly increased regional leaflet stress and strain compared with normal levels. Stress increases ranged from 80 % to 360 % and strain increases ranged from 60 % to 200 % in the 50 % dilated Marfan model. Leaflet stresses and strains were disproportionately high at the attachment edge and <b>coaptation</b> area. Leaflet <b>coaptation</b> was decreased by approximately 20 % in the 50 % root dilatation model.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purposes}} of this study were to examine whether tethering of the mitral leaflets affects <b>coaptation</b> in patients with functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) and to assess the interaction between the mitral <b>coaptation</b> and mitral regurgitation severity. BackgroundFunctional mitral regurgitation causes restriction of leaflet closure as a result of enhanced tethering of the mitral leaflets and papillary muscle (PM) displacement. MethodsThree-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography was performed in 44 patients with FMR related to the bilateral PM displacement and in 56 controls. The distance between the tip of the anterior or posterior PM and the intervalvular fibrosa were measured as the lateral or medial tethering length (TL) in midsystole. To evaluate the degree of <b>coaptation,</b> <b>coaptation</b> length (CL) at medial, middle, and lateral sites of mitral valve and an estimate of <b>coaptation</b> area (CA) were measured.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Incomplete mitral leaflet <b>coaptation</b> during acute left {{ventricular}} ischemia {{is associated with}} end-diastolic mitral annular dilatation and ischemic mitral regurgitation. Annular rings were implanted in sheep to investigate whether annular reduction alone is sufficient to prevent mitral regurgitation during acute posterolateral {{left ventricular}} ischemia. Methods: Radiopaque markers were inserted around the mitral anulus, on papillary muscle tips, and on the central meridian of both mitral leaflets in three groups of sheep: control (n = 5), Physio ring (n = 5) (Baxter Cardiovascular Div, Santa Ana, Calif), and Duran ring (n = 6) (Medtronic Heart Valve Div, Minneapolis, Minn). After 8 ± 1 days, animals were studied with biplane videofluoroscopy before and during left ventricular ischemia. Annular area was calculated from 3 -dimensional marker coordinates and <b>coaptation</b> defined as minimal distance between leaflet edge markers. Results: Before ischemia, leaflet <b>coaptation</b> occurred just after end-diastole in all groups (control 17 ± 41, Duran 33 ± 30, Physio 33 ± 24 ms, mean ± SD, P >. 2 by analysis of variance). During ischemia, regurgitation was detected in all control animals, and leaflet <b>coaptation</b> was delayed to 88 ± 8 ms after end-diastole (P =. 02 vs preischemia). This was associated with increased end-diastolic annular area (8. 0 ± 0. 9 vs 6. 7 ± 0. 6 cm 2, P =. 004) and septal-lateral annular diameter (2. 9 ± 0. 1 vs 2. 5 ± 0. 1 cm, P =. 02). Mitral regurgitation did not develop in Duran or Physio sheep, time to <b>coaptation</b> was unchanged (Duran 25 ± 25 ms, Physio 30 ± 48 ms [both P >. 2 vs preischemia]), and annular area remained fixed. Conclusion: Mitral annular area reduction and fixation with an annuloplasty ring eliminated delayed leaflet <b>coaptation</b> and prevented mitral regurgitation during acute left ventricular ischemia after ring implantation.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{mechanism}} by which incomplete mitral leaflet <b>coaptation</b> develops during ischemic mitral regurgitation is debated, with {{recent studies suggesting that}} incomplete mitral leaflet <b>coaptation</b> may be due to apically displaced papillary muscle tips. Yet quantitative in vivo three-dimensional mitral leaflet motion during ischemic mitral regurgitation has never been described. Methods: Radiopaque markers (sutured around the mitral anulus, to the central free mitral leaflet edges, and to both papillary muscle tips and bases) were imaged with the use of biplane videofluoroscopy in six closed-chest, sedated sheep before (control) and during induction of acute ischemic mitral regurgitation. Leaflet <b>coaptation</b> was defined as the minimum distance measured between edge markers during control conditions. Results: During control, leaflet <b>coaptation</b> occurred 23 ± 7 msec (mean ± standard error of the mean) after end-diastole, when left ventricular pressure was 27 ± 6 mm Hg. During ischemic mitral regurgitation, <b>coaptation</b> was delayed to 115  ± 19 msec after end-diastole (p 0. 01 {abs 2 }vs control [n = 4]) when left ventricular pressure was 88 ± 4 mm Hg. At end-diastole during ischemic mitral regurgitation, the mitral anulus area was 14 % ± 2 % larger than control (7. 4  ± 0. 3 cm 2 vs 6. 5  ± 0. 2 cm 2, p 0. 005) {{as the result of the}} lengthening of muscular annular regions (76. 0  ± 2. 5 mm vs 70. 5  ± 1. 4 mm, p 0. 01). Mitral anulus shape (ratio of two diameters) at end-diastole was more circular during ischemic mitral regurgitation (0. 79  ± 0. 01 vs 0. 71  ± 0. 02, p < 0. 01). At end-diastole during ischemic mitral regurgitation, the posterior papillary muscle tip was displaced 1. 5  ± 0. 5 mm laterally and 2. 0  ± 0. 6 mm posteriorly (p 0. 02 vs control), but there was no apical displacement of either papillary muscle tip. Conclusions: Incomplete mitral leaflet <b>coaptation</b> during acute ischemic mitral regurgitation occurred early in systole, not at end-systole, and was due to “loitering” of the leaflets associated with posterior mitral anulus enlargement and circularization, as well as some posterolateral, but not apical, posterior papillary muscle tip displacement. These data suggest that early systolic mitral anulus dilatation and shape change and altered posterior papillary muscle motion are the primary mechanisms by which incomplete mitral leaflet <b>coaptation</b> occurs during acute ischemic mitral regurgitation.

40|$|The {{importance}} of {{a sufficient number of}} nerve fibers at a proximal <b>coaptation</b> site is indisputable for the successful repair of nerves; however, the quality of nerve fibers required at this site has yet to be defined. The present study deals with the question of whether it is necessary to trim nerves back to unaffected neuronal tissue or whether the <b>coaptation</b> on recently regenerated nerve fibers, commonly believed to produce a poor quality of repair can, in fact, produce adequate nerve regeneration. Twenty New Zealand White rabbits received a standardized crush lesion on the peroneal nerves of both hind legs. Four weeks later, the nerves of the left hind legs (n = 20) were transected 10 mm distal to the previous crush lesion and coapted to the freshly regenerated nerve fibers. For comparison, on 10 right hind legs, the nerves were transected at the site of previous crushing (Group A, superimposition) or 10 mm proximal to the site of crushing on unscathed nerve fibers (Group B). Eleven weeks later, the quality of nerve regeneration was assessed by the toe-spreading reflex, electrophysiologic data, muscle weight, and histomorphologic evaluation. In the animals of Group A, the quality of nerve regeneration following <b>coaptation</b> on the regrown axons did not differ in any of the examined parameters from the quality of nerve fibers outgrown from the site of the superimposed lesion. Both lesions led to a completely functional reinnervation. Also in Group B, nerve action potential recording and histologic data on both sides did not reveal {{a significant difference between the}} number and maturation of nerve fibers equidistant from the suture site, shortly before muscle entrance. With this <b>coaptation</b> model, it could be demonstrated in the peroneal nerve of rabbits, that <b>coaptation</b> to recently regenerated nerve fibers leads to a significant functional regeneration...|$|E

40|$|Microsurgical suturing is {{the gold}} {{standard}} of nerve <b>coaptation.</b> Although literature on the usefulness of fibrin glue as an alternative is becoming increasingly available, it remains contradictory. Furthermore, no data exist on how both repair methods might influence the morphological aspects (arborization; branching) of early peripheral nerve regeneration. We used the sciatic nerve transplantation model in thy- 1 yellow fluorescent protein mice (YFP; n = 10). Pieces of nerve (1 cm) were grafted from YFP-negative mice (n = 10) into those expressing YFP. We performed microsuture coaptations {{on one side and}} used fibrin glue for repair on the contralateral side. Seven days after grafting, the regeneration distance, the percentage of regenerating and arborizing axons, the number of branches per axon, the <b>coaptation</b> failure rate, the gap size at the repair site and the time needed for surgical repair were all investigated. Fibrin glue repair resulted in regenerating axons travelling further into the distal nerve. It also increased the percentage of arborizing axons. No <b>coaptation</b> failure was detected. Gap sizes were comparable in both groups. Fibrin glue significantly reduced surgical repair time. The increase in regeneration distance, even after the short period of time, is in line with the results of others that showed faster axonal regeneration after fibrin glue repair. The increase in arborizing axons could be another explanation for better functional and electrophysiological results after fibrin glue repair. Fibrin glue nerve <b>coaptation</b> seems to be a promising alternative to microsuture repair...|$|E

Several surgical repair techniques have been described, but sometimes an acceptable <b>coaptation</b> of the mitral leaflets can not be achieved. Rather than accept a mitral regurgitation or resort to a mitral valve replacement, particularly in children, we have added a suspension of the posterior leaflet directly to the annuloplasty ring.

40|$|Introduction: We {{proposed}} using compression sonography {{to observe}} the <b>coaptation</b> and collapse of the radial artery as a surrogate for automated cuff blood pressures (BP). We hypothesize that the pressure required to achieve <b>coaptation</b> and complete collapse of the artery would correlate to the diastolic and systolic BP, respectively. This pilot study {{was to assess the}} feasibility of ultrasound-guided radial artery compression (URAC) for BP measurement and compare patient comfort levels during automated cuff with URAC measurements. Methods: This was a prospective cohort pilot study with a convenience sampling of 25 adult patients at a single urban emergency department. URAC pressure was measured, followed by cuff manometry on the same arm. A 100 mL normal saline bag was connected to the Stryker pressure monitor and placed on the volar wrist. Pressure was applied to the bag with a linear transducer and the radial artery was observed for <b>coaptation</b> of the anterior and posterior walls and complete collapse. Pressures required for <b>coaptation</b> and collapse were recorded from the Stryker display. Patient level of comfort was also documented during the URAC method, with patients reporting either “more,” “same” or “less” comfort in comparison to automated cuffs. We analyzed data using intraclass correlation and paired t-tests. Interrater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation. Results: The mean cuff systolic BP was 138. 6 ± 22. 1 mmHg compared to 126. 9 ± 19. 8 mmHg for the URAC systolic BP (p= 0. 02). For diastolic BP, {{there was no significant difference}} between the cuff BP and the URAC BP (83. 7 ± 13. 0 cuff vs. 86. 5 ± 19. 8 URAC, p= 0. 46). The intraclass correlation (ICC) for systolic BP was 0. 48 (p= 0. 04) and 0. 57 (p= 0. 02) for diastolic BP. The agreement between the two observers was 0. 88 for identifying <b>coaptation</b> on ultrasound (diastolic pressure) and was 0. 92 for identifying collapse (systolic pressure). Eighty percent (20 / 25) of subjects found the URAC method more comfortable than the cuff measurement, and the remainder found it the same (5 / 20). Conclusion: This pilot study showed statistically significant moderate correlation between automated cuff diastolic BP and URAC measurements for vessel <b>coaptation.</b> Additionally, most patients found the URAC method more comfortable than traditional cuff measurements. Compression ultrasonography shows promise as an alternative method of BP measurement, though future studies are needed. [West J Emerg Med. 2017; 18 (3) 502 - 508. ...|$|E
