5|$|PlayStation Home is a {{community-based}} social gaming networking {{service for}} the PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation Network (PSN). It is available directly from the PlayStation 3 XrossMediaBar. Membership is free, and only requires a PSN account. Home has been in development since early 2005 and started an open public beta test on December 11, 2008. Home allows users to create a custom avatar, which {{can be made to}} suit the user's preference. Users can decorate their avatar's personal apartment ("HomeSpace") with default, bought, or won items. They can travel throughout the Home world (except cross region), which is constantly updated by Sony and partners. Each part of the world is known as a space. Public spaces <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> for display, fun, or for meeting people. Home features many mini-games which can be single player or multiplayer. Users can shop for new items to express themselves more through their avatars or HomeSpace. Home features video screens in many places for advertising, but the main video content is shown at the theatre for entertainment. Home plays host to a variety of special events which range from prize-giving events to entertaining events. Users can also use Home to connect with friends and customize content. Xi, a once notable feature of Home, is the world's first console based Alternate Reality Game that took place in secret areas in Home and was created by nDreams.|$|E

It is levied by the churches {{themselves}} and not by the government. The obligation to pay church tax <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> evaded by an official declaration to cease church membership. The tax is calculated on the basis of personal income. It amounts to about 1.1% (Catholic church) and 1.5% (Protestant church).|$|E

25|$|The single {{candle in}} the left-front holder of the ornate six-branched {{chandelier}} is possibly the candle used in traditional Flemish marriage customs. Lit in full daylight, like the sanctuary lamp in a church, the candle may allude {{to the presence of}} the Holy Ghost or the ever-present eye of God. Alternatively, Margaret Koster posits that the painting is a memorial portrait, as the single lit candle on Giovanni's side contrasts with the burnt-out candle whose wax stub <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> seen on his wife's side, evoking a common literary metaphor: he lives on, she is dead.|$|E

She's got morals and this isn't good enough." [...] Cooper has also spoke of her confusion of the audiences perception that Jacqui is [...] "a bitch" [...] when she has strong morals. Cooper has said she is proud of Jacqui's wardrobe {{because it is not}} glam. She brands her as the complete opposite of the [...] "honey image" [...] the serial sometimes becomes associated with. Describing how she plays Jacqui she states: [...] "It's great playing Jacqui because I <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> completely grotesque and over the top, snarling and grunting." ...|$|E

It’s also to make people realize it’s not just about {{volunteering}} to go {{and live in the}} Congo for four years. It’s as much about working a soup kitchen as it is helping an elderly person. Contributing something positive doesn’t have to be a lifelong commitment; it <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> daily gestures. So, it was about giving the whole issue perspective... One video and a message aren't going to save everything. But when you say things together, maybe the message will be heard and hopefully will provoke action. Inherently people are good, and inherently people are distracted and somewhat lazy, so it comes down to how do you get people’s attention." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} to continuous distillation is batch distillation, where {{the mixture is}} added to the unit {{at the start of the}} distillation, distillate fractions are taken out sequentially in time (one after another) during the distillation, and the remaining bottoms fraction is removed at the end. [...] Because each of the distillate fractions are taken out at different times, only one distillate exit point (location) is needed for a batch distillation and the distillate <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> switched to a different receiver, a fraction-collecting container. [...] Batch distillation is often used when smaller quantities are distilled. [...] In a continuous distillation, each of the fraction streams is taken simultaneously throughout operation; therefore, a separate exit point is needed for each fraction. [...] In practice when there are multiple distillate fractions, the distillate exit points are located at different heights on a fractionating column. The bottoms fraction can be taken from the bottom of the distillation column or unit, but is often taken from a reboiler connected to the bottom of the column.|$|E

It was on this occasion that the President, Adam Sedgwick, referred to Smith as [...] "the Father of English Geology". Smith travelled to Dublin with the British Association in 1835, and there unexpectedly received an honorary Doctorate of Laws (LL.D.) from Trinity College. In 1838 he was appointed {{as one of the}} commissioners to select building-stone for the new Palace of Westminster.

2500|$|However, {{the maximum}} {{pressure}} {{is limited to}} atmospheric pressure, {{so that all the}} equipment has to be much larger and heavier to compensate. This disadvantage is made worse at high altitude. The vacuum brake is also considerably slower acting in both applying and releasing the brake; this requires a greater level of skill and anticipation from the driver. Conversely, the vacuum brake had the advantage of gradual release long before the Westinghouse automatic air brake, which was originally only available in the direct-release form still common in freight service. A primary fault of vacuum brakes is the inability to easily find leaks. [...] In a positive air system, a leak is quickly found due to the escaping pressurized air; discovering a vacuum leak is more difficult, although it is easier to repair when found because a piece of rubber (for example) <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> tied around the leak and will be firmly held there by the vacuum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album is}} named after track four, [...] "Talk a Good Game" [...] which {{features}} Kevin Cossom. Over a [...] "snaky but sweet" [...] production from T-Minus Rowland sings [...] "I don’t think I can take another broken promise / Why do things the hard way when you <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> honest". Hampp said that Cossom's rap gave the song a [...] "street edge". It takes the listener on an emotional journey according to The Honesty Hour. The next song, [...] "Down on Love", is a midtempo production featuring another classic sample, this time the 1987 song [...] "Rock Steady" [...] by American R group The Whispers. Using her mezzo-soprano vocals, Rowland takes on a downtrodden romantic situation, [...] "We want two different things at two different times / You know how the story go / Easy come easy go". [...] "Dirty Laundry" [...] was co-written by Rowland, Carlos McKinney and The Dream, and is R [...] "confessional" [...] ballad, containing [...] "R jam spools" [...] and a piano-led melody. It details a [...] "frank and often poignant commentary" [...] on Rowland's life. The song is a [...] "brutal" [...] chronicle of {{the last ten years}} of Rowland's life, covering her envy of Beyoncé's solo success and the end of an abusive relationship. Amongst the lyrics, Rowland sings [...] "Kinda lucky I was in her shadow / Phone call from my sister what’s the matter / She said, 'Oh no / You gotta leave' / I’m on the kitchen floor / He took the keys." ...|$|E
