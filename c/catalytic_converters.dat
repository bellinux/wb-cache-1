Being a heavy metal, it leads to health problems upon exposure to its salts; but due to its corrosion resistance, metallic platinum has not been linked to adverse health effects.

5|$|After the discovery, {{the rare}} element had only minor applications; for example, {{by the turn}} of the century, rhodium-containing {{thermocouples}} were used to measure temperatures up to 1800°C. The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating. The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust.|$|E

Today, cerium and its compounds have a variety of uses: for example, cerium(IV) oxide is used to polish glass and is an important part of <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters.</b> Cerium metal is used in ferrocerium lighters for its pyrophoric properties.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{three-way}} <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> {{systems have}} air injection systems {{with the air}} injected between the first (NOx reduction) and second (HC and CO oxidation) stages of the converter.

5|$|Most {{palladium}} is {{used for}} <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> in the automobile industry. In the run up to year 2000, the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because for political reasons, the export quota was not granted on time. The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of $1100 per troy ounce in January 2001. Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1billion.|$|E

Recycling is also a source, mostly from scrapped <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters.</b> The numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable investment interest.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} drivers {{of growth in}} an automotive components industry. This research looks at a sub-sector within the South African components industry namely the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> industry. This research investigates foreign ownership, innovation activities and levels of education as possible drivers {{of growth in the}} <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> industry. This research compares the results of the analysis on foreign ownership, innovation activities and levels of education of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> industry against the results of the components industry. The reason for doing that is {{to see if there are}} significant differences between the two industries. This research made use of data collected as part of a collaborative study that was conducted in the total South African components industry. In 2007 the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> industry was responsible for 55 percent of the R 39 Billion worth of the total components that was exported. The purpose of this research is to understand what drives growth in the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> industry. The findings of this research do not provide enough proof to exactly identify why the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> industry is so successful if compared against the components industry. No significant difference was detected when the results of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> industry is compared against the results of the components industry in terms of innovation, levels of education and levels of foreign ownership. The only slight difference that was measured was that the probability of some product and process innovation taking place in the <b>catalytic</b> <b>converter</b> industry is higher than the probability that some product and process innovation taking place in the components industry. This is not enough proof to differentiate the two industries completely from each other.

5|$|The element's major use (approximately 80% {{of world}} rhodium production) is {{as one of}} the {{catalysts}} in the three-way <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters</b> in automobiles. Because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals, and because of its rarity, rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings. White gold is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its appearance while sterling silver is often rhodium-plated for tarnish resistance.|$|E
5|$|The largest use of {{palladium}} {{today is}} in <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters.</b> Palladium {{is also used}} in jewelry, dentistry, watch making, blood sugar test strips, aircraft spark plugs, surgical instruments, and electrical contacts. Palladium {{is also used to}} make professional transverse (concert or classical) flutes. As a commodity, palladium bullion has ISO currency codes of XPD and 964. Palladium is one of only four metals to have such codes, the others being gold, silver and platinum. Because it absorbs hydrogen, palladium is a key component of the controversial cold fusion experiments that began in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Some {{palladium}} is emitted {{with the}} exhaust gases of cars with <b>catalytic</b> <b>converters.</b> Between 4 and 108ng/km of palladium particulate is released by such cars, while the total uptake from food {{is estimated to}} be less than 2µg per person a day. The second possible source of palladium is dental restoration, from which the uptake of palladium {{is estimated to be}} less than 15µg per person per day. People working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake. For soluble compounds such as palladium chloride, 99% is eliminated from the body within 3 days.|$|E

The increase of soot weight in entering gas increases the needed converter length. On the other hand, the increase of catalyst diameter does not affect to soot weight along converter and temperature profile, but results a less pressure drop.
