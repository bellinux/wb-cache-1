5|$|The Smith Gun {{was capable}} of firing both anti-personnel and {{anti-tank}} rounds (the latter capable of penetrating some 60mm of armour), and provided the Home Guard and local defence units with a potentially potent anti-personnel and anti-armour weapon. However, there were several flaws in its design, and as such it was not well liked {{by some of the}} Home Guard units to which it was issued. It was heavy and awkward to manhandle, particularly over rough ground and in urban areas; in the latter, it was recommended that toggle ropes be used to manoeuvre the weapon into position. The low muzzle velocity meant that shells were lobbed in a high <b>curved</b> <b>trajectory,</b> making precise range calculations and firing experience vital. This was difficult when so few rounds were available for training, a problem compounded by early batches possessing faulty fuzes that led to the Smith Gun's alleged 'terrifying reputation for killing its crew'. (This probably arises from the first fatal malfunction when, during a live-fire exercise in 1942, Corporal Maynard of 2819 Squadron, RAF Regiment was killed in an explosion.|$|E

25|$|The ball {{travels in}} the air, {{and there is}} no net force upon it. To the {{stationary}} observer the ball follows a straight-line path, so there is no problem squaring this trajectory with zero net force. However, the rotating observer sees a curved path. Kinematics insists that a force (pushing {{to the right of the}} instantaneous direction of travel for a counter-clockwise rotation) must be present to cause this curvature, so the rotating observer is forced to invoke a combination of centrifugal and Coriolis forces to provide the net force required to cause the <b>curved</b> <b>trajectory.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As a {{definition}} of E and B, the Lorentz force is only {{a definition}} in principle because a real particle (as opposed to the hypothetical [...] "test charge" [...] of infinitesimally-small mass and charge) would generate its own finite E and B fields, which would alter the electromagnetic force that it experiences. In addition, if the charge experiences acceleration, as if forced into a <b>curved</b> <b>trajectory</b> by some external agency, it emits radiation that causes braking of its motion. See for example Bremsstrahlung and synchrotron light. These effects occur through both a direct effect (called the radiation reaction force) and indirectly (by affecting the motion of nearby charges and currents). Moreover, net force must include gravity, electroweak, and any other forces aside from electromagnetic force.|$|E
2500|$|The aim of fast bowling is {{to deliver}} the ball in such a fashion as to cause the batsman to make a mistake. This is {{achieved}} by making the hard cricket ball deviate from a predictable, linear trajectory at a speed that restricts {{the amount of time}} in which the batsman can compensate for it. For deviation caused by the ball's stitching (the seam), the ball will bounce off the pitch and deflect either away from the batsman's body, or inwards towards them. Swing bowlers on the other hand also use the seam of the ball but in a different way. To 'bowl swing' is to induce a <b>curved</b> <b>trajectory</b> of the cricket ball through the air. Swing bowlers use a combination of seam orientation, body position at the point of release, asymmetric ball polishing, and variations in delivery speed to affect an aerodynamic influence on the ball. The ability of a bowler to induce lateral deviation or 'sideways movement' obviously make it difficult for the batsman to address the flight of the ball accurately. [...] Beyond this ability to create an unpredictable path of ball trajectory, the fastest bowlers can be equally potent by simply delivering a ball at such a rate that a batsman simply fails to react either correctly, or at all. A typical fast delivery has a speed in the range of [...]|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} target {{selection for}} visually guided reaching movements in visual search, {{in which participants}} reached to an odd-colored target presented with two homogenous distractors. The colors of the target and distractors were randomly switched for each trial between red and green, {{and the location of}} the target was varied. Therefore either color could be a distractor or target, and the identity was resolved by grouping two distractors having the same color. Thus, there was ongoing competition between a target and distractors. In some trials, reaches were directed to the target, and in other trials, reaches were initially directed towards a distractor and corrected in mid-flight, showing highly <b>curved</b> <b>trajectories.</b> Interestingly, trials with highly <b>curved</b> <b>trajectories</b> were no less efficient in terms of accuracy or total time. The extra time taken up in movement duration was offset by shorter initial latencies. By analyzing <b>curved</b> <b>trajectories,</b> we demonstrated that corrective movements occur shortly after the onset of initial movement, suggesting that a corrective new target is selected even before initial movement is executed. This provides an explanation as to why misdirected reaches, hastily initiated, can be corrected with minimal loss in overall efficiency. In addition, our results show that the details of movement trajectories allow us to visualize the dynamics of target selection as they unfold in time...|$|R

40|$|The {{stochastic}} {{dynamics of}} an active particle undergoing a constant speed and additionally driven by an overall fluctuating torque is investigated. The random torque forces are expressed by a stochastic differential equation for the angular dynamics of the particle determining the orientation of motion. In addition to a constant torque, the particle is supplemented by random torques which are modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with given correlation time τ_c. These nonvanishing correlations cause a persistence of the particles' trajectories and a change of the effective spatial diffusion coefficient. We discuss the mean square displacement {{as a function of}} the correlation time and the noise intensity and detect a nonmonotonic dependence of the effective diffusion coefficient with respect to both correlation time and noise strength. A maximal diffusion behavior is obtained if the correlated angular noise straightens the <b>curved</b> <b>trajectories,</b> interrupted by small pirouettes, whereby the correlated noise amplifies a straightening of the <b>curved</b> <b>trajectories</b> caused by the constant torque.

One-sided core-jet structures abound, and superluminal motion is frequently measured. In a few cases, both distinct moving features and diffuse underlying jet emission can be detected. Superluminal motion seen in such sources is typically complex, on <b>curved</b> <b>trajectories</b> or ridge lines, and with variable component velocities, including stationary features. The <b>curved</b> <b>trajectories</b> seen can be modeled by helical motion within the underlying jet flow. The very-long-baseline interferometry {{properties of the}} superluminal features in the jet of 3 C 345 and other similar sources {{can be explained by}} models invoking the emission from shocks, at least within the vicinity of the compact core. Inverse-Compton calculations, constrained by x-ray observations, yield realistic estimates for the physical conditions in the parsec-scale jet. There is evidence for a transition region in this source beyond which other factors (e. g., plasma interactions and nonsynchrotron radiation processes) may become prominent.

40|$|Participants {{initiated}} a reaching movement {{to a single}} target more rapidly than to an odd-color target among distractors when the two trial types were presented in separate blocks, reflecting differentiated states of sensorimotor readiness for a relatively easy (single target) versus harder (odd-color target) tasks. This pattern was eliminated when the two trial types were randomly mixed. Latencies for the easy single trials increased, and those for the harder odd-color trials decreased, showing homogenization. The faster movement initiation in the odd-color target task was accompanied by <b>curved</b> <b>trajectories,</b> directed toward a distractor initially but corrected in midflight. Two possible hypotheses could account for this differentiated adjustment in visuomotor readiness: (1) explicit knowledge of upcoming trial types and (2) implicit leaning derived from history of the very recent past, that is, repetition of {{the same type of}} trials. To distinguish between these two accounts, we included a third condition where the trial types were predictably alternated.
