50|$|Geometrinae is the {{nominate}} subfamily of the geometer moth family (Geometridae). It {{is strongly}} split, containing {{a considerable number}} of tribes of which most are presently very small or monotypic, however. These small moths are often a light bluish green, leading to the <b>common</b> name of <b>emerald</b> moths, though a few species called thus are also found in the tribe Campaeini of the Ennominae.|$|R
5000|$|The Geometridae family {{contains}} over 21,000 {{species and}} can be found all across the globe. [...] The Geometrinae subfamily contains 2350 species. Many of these species can be identified by the similar emerald green coloration observed in N. arizonaria, which {{led to the creation of}} the <b>common</b> name <b>emerald</b> moth. Comparative analysis of Nemoria’s biogeographic history suggests that the genus originated in South America. [...] Such a close proximity to the United States’ southwest region can explain the present day localization to this area. It has been suggested that Nemoria was introduced many times - the genus is the largest of the New World Geometrinae and is estimated to be around 7.5 million years old. Nemoria is most commonly known for the phenotypic plasticity of its larvae stages in many species. There are now 15 recognized species of Nemoria.|$|R
50|$|Mutations {{can appear}} both {{individually}} or {{in a wide}} variety of combinations such as albino (White(faced) Ino), Pearled Ino (Pearled Lutino), Whitefaced Pied and Opaline-Cinnamon (a.k.a. Pearled-Cinnamon). Still fairly hard to find is the rather new yellow-suffusion (incorrectly known as Emerald and/or Olive) mutation. Cockatiels do not actually have green pigment in their plumage, thus yellow-suffusion specimens don't either. The yellow suffusion combined with underlying black (or pure brown in Cinnamon specimens) pigmentation produces an illusion of greenish tones giving rise to the genetically incorrect <b>common</b> names of <b>Emerald</b> for this trait.|$|R

25|$|Stones whose {{outlines}} {{are either}} square or rectangular and whose facets are rectilinear and arranged {{parallel to the}} girdle are known as step- or trap-cut stones. These stones often have their corners truncated, creating an emerald cut (after its most <b>common</b> application to <b>emerald</b> gemstones) with an octagonal outline. This is done because sharp corners are points of weakness where a diamond may cleave or fracture. Instead of a culet, step-cut stones have a keel running {{the length of the}} pavilion terminus. Like other fancy shaped diamonds, emerald cut diamonds can {{come in a variety of}} length to width ratios. The most popular and classic outline of emerald cut diamonds are close a value of 1.5.|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{experience}} of piloting an information commons at a major academic library in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach - At the pilot phase, assessment is crucial. The article reports how the HKUST Library monitors usage and conducted satisfaction surveys to identify users' needs, expose strengths and weaknesses of the service, and set direction for future development. Findings - The assessment data reveal users' needs and behaviors. Such information helps the Library to refine the existing service, and compose a sound proposal for expansion. The experience cumulated through the pilot also forms the basis of future planning. Originality/value - The experience that HKUST tested the concept of commons using a pilot phase, guided by its assessment program, may have reference value to other <b>commons</b> projects. © <b>Emerald</b> Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} we took up our march silently with the dawn, the prairie grouse {{whirring}} ahead of us. At last, as afternoon drew on, a dark line of green edged the prairie to the westward, and our spirits rose. From mouth to mouth ran the word that these were the woods which fringed the bluff above Kaskaskia itself. We pressed ahead, and the destiny of the new Republic for which we had fought made us walk unseen. Excitement keyed us high; we reached the shade, plunged into it, and presently came out staring at the bastioned corners of a fort which rose from the centre of a clearing. It had once defended the place, but now stood abandoned and dismantled. Beyond it, {{at the edge of}} the bluff, we halted, astonished. The sun was falling in the west, and below us was the goal for the sight of which we had suffered so much. At our feet, across the wooded bottom, was the Kaskaskia River, and beyond, the peaceful little French village with its low houses and orchards and gardens colored by the touch of the evening light. In the centre of it stood a stone church with its belfry; but our searching eyes alighted on the spot to the southward of it, near the river. There stood a rambling stone building with the shingles of its roof weathered black, and all around it a palisade of pointed sticks thrust in the ground, and with a pair of gates and watch-towers. Drooping on its staff was the standard of England. North and south of the village the <b>emerald</b> <b>common</b> gleamed in the slanting light, speckled red and white and black by grazing cattle. Here and there, in untidy brown patches, were Indian settlements, and far away to the westward the tawny Father of Waters gleamed through the cottonwoods.|$|R

40|$|The Ianapera emerald deposit {{is located}} in the Neoproterozoic Vohibory Block of {{southern}} Madagascar. The local geology consists of intercalated migmatitic gneissic units and calcareous metasedimentary rocks, containing boudinaged metamorphosed mafic/ultramafic lenses, all intruded by pegmatite veins. These units occur near the hinge of the tightly folded Ianapera antiform, within a few kilometers of the Ampanihy shear zone. Emerald mineralization is hosted by metasomatic phlogopite veins, and bodies developed within the mafic/ultramafic rocks. Based on field and textural relationships, we distinguish proximal and distal styles of mineralization. Proximal mineralization occurs at the contact of pegmatite veins with mafic/ultramafic units; in the distal style, pegmatites are not observed. Three types of emeralds could be distinguished, mainly on the basis of color and mineral zoning. Some of these emeralds have the most Al-depleted and Cr-rich composition ever recorded. Another characteristic feature to the Ianapera deposit and, to our knowledge, yet unreported, is the association of some emeralds with scapolite in metasomatised mafic rocks. Mineral inclusions are <b>common</b> in most <b>emeralds</b> and include phlogopite, carbonates, barite, K-feldspar, quartz, pyrite, zircon, monazite, bastnaesite, phenakite, plus Fe and Cr oxides. However, feldspar and rare earth element-bearing minerals occur predominantly in proximal emeralds, which also have a more incompatible trace-element signature than distal emeralds. We propose a model related to syn- to post-tectonic magmatic-hydrothermal activity. Pegmatitic bodies intruded units of the Ianapera antiform probably during tectonic relaxation. Exsolution of fluids rich in halogens and incompatible elements from the cooling pegmatites caused hydrothermal metasomatism of Cr-bearing mafic/ultramafic rocks in direct contact with the pegmatites. Local fracturing favored fluid infiltration, permitting the formation of distal mineralization. Emerald composition was controlled by the chemistry of the host rock. The presence of carbonate mineral inclusions in the emeralds and the high F-activity indicated by elevated F-contents in newly formed minerals suggest transport of Be as a fluoride-carbonate complex. It seems likely that beryl formation was triggered by precipitation of F-rich phlogopite, which removed the complexing ligand from the fluid...|$|R

50|$|The greater racket-tailed drongo {{is one of}} {{the most}} common birds at Bukit Timah (Dicrurus paradiseus).

5000|$|There are no {{preserved}} {{specimens of}} the Norfolk ground dove {{and the majority}} of unambiguous information about the species comes from the single illustration made by John Hunter for the book Collection of 100 original watercolours of Birds, Flowers, Fishes and Natives done during 1788-1790 in New South Wales, pl. no 89, with a description [...] "Dove. Norflok Island". In the past the scientific name Columba norfolciensis Latham (1801) was used to refer to this species; however, the name was also used to refer to the <b>common</b> <b>emerald</b> dove and the white-headed pigeon, and it cannot be confirmed that Latham's original description of Columba norfolciensis refers to the species illustrated by Hunter. The name Columba norfolciensis was suppressed by ICZN in 2010. Joseph Forshaw (2015) introduced a new scientific name for the Norfolk ground dove, Alopecoenas norfolkensis.|$|E
