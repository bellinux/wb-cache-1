5|$|The H2-receptor {{antagonist}} <b>cimetidine</b> causes {{an increase}} in the plasma concentration of metformin, by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys; both metformin and <b>cimetidine</b> are cleared from the body by tubular secretion, and both, particularly the cationic (positively charged) form of <b>cimetidine,</b> may compete for the same transport mechanism. A small double-blind, randomized study found the antibiotic cephalexin to also increase metformin concentrations by a similar mechanism; theoretically, other cationic medications may produce the same effect.|$|E
5|$|April: Marshall and Ian Hislop begin a {{study to}} compare bismuth {{treatment}} with <b>cimetidine.</b> The study is abandoned because it is inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam is {{primarily}} metabolized via CYP3A4. Combining CYP3A4 inhibitors such as <b>cimetidine,</b> erythromycin, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, propoxyphene, and ritonavir delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam, which {{may result in}} its accumulation and increased severity of its side effects.|$|E
25|$|Reported {{side effects}} of <b>cimetidine</b> include diarrhea, rashes, dizziness, fatigue, constipation, and muscle pain, {{all of which are}} usually mild and transient. It has been {{reported}} that mental confusion may occur in the elderly. Because of its hormonal effects, <b>cimetidine</b> rarely may cause sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction and gynecomastia (0.1â€“0.2%) in males during long-term treatment. Rarely, interstitial nephritis, urticaria, and angioedema have been reported with <b>cimetidine</b> treatment. <b>Cimetidine</b> is also commonly associated with transient raised aminotransferase activity; hepatotoxicity is rare.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> was {{discovered}} in 1971 and came into commercial use in 1977. <b>Cimetidine</b> was approved in the United Kingdom in 1976, and was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration for prescriptions in 1979.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of longer-acting H2 receptor antagonists with fewer drug interactions and adverse effects, such as ranitidine and famotidine, decreased {{the use of}} <b>cimetidine,</b> and though it is still used, <b>cimetidine</b> is no longer among the more widely used of the H2-receptor antagonists.|$|E
25|$|The drug <b>cimetidine</b> heightens {{praziquantel}} bioavailability.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> {{has been}} found to possess {{clinically}} significant albeit weak antiandrogen activity at high doses. It {{has been found}} to directly and competitively displace testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and antagonize the androgen receptor (AR) in animals. In addition, <b>cimetidine</b> {{has been found to}} inhibit 2-hydroxylation of estradiol (via inhibition of CYP450 enzymes, which are involved in the metabolic inactivation of estradiol), resulting in increased levels of estrogen. By increasing estrogen levels, <b>cimetidine</b> can also decrease testosterone and increase prolactin levels.|$|E
25|$|Glaxo refined {{the model}} further by {{replacing}} the imidazole-ring of <b>cimetidine</b> with a furan-ring with a nitrogen-containing substituent, {{and in doing}} so developed ranitidine. Ranitidine was found to have a far-improved tolerability profile (i.e. fewer adverse drug reactions), longer-lasting action, and ten times the activity of <b>cimetidine.</b>|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} pharmacokinetics, <b>cimetidine</b> in {{particular}} interferes {{with some of}} the body's mechanisms of drug metabolism and elimination through the liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway. To be specific, <b>cimetidine</b> is an inhibitor of the P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4. By reducing the metabolism of drugs through these enzymes, <b>cimetidine</b> may increase their serum concentrations to toxic levels. Many drugs are affected, including warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, lidocaine, quinidine, propranolol, labetalol, metoprolol, methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, some benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, sulfonylureas, metronidazole, and some recreational drugs such as ethanol and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine,</b> rifampicin, and {{thioridazine}} cause {{interactions with}} zaleplon.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> is S-oxygenated {{by human}} flavin-containing monooxygenases, {{specifically}} FMO1 and FMO3.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> {{reduces the}} {{absorption}} of ketoconazole and itraconazole (which require a low pH).|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> {{inhibits}} the renal excretion of metformin and procainamide, {{resulting in}} increased circulating levels of these drugs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> may {{decrease}} {{the effects of}} CYP2D6 substrates that are prodrugs, such as codeine, tramadol, and tamoxifen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> {{appears to}} be very safe in overdose, {{producing}} no symptoms even with massive overdoses (e.g., 20 g).|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> {{has also}} been {{reported}} to be effective for acute porphyric crisis and possibly effective for long-term prophylaxis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> {{inhibits}} ALA synthase {{activity and}} hence {{may have some}} therapeutic value in preventing and treating acute porphyria attacks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> is used {{to inhibit}} stomach acid {{production}} and {{is used in the}} treatment of heartburn and peptic ulcers.|$|E
25|$|Following {{administration}} of <b>cimetidine,</b> the elimination half-life and area-under-curve of zolmitriptan and its active metabolites were roughly doubled.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine,</b> {{fluvoxamine}} and propranolol {{causes a}} marked {{increase in the}} elimination half-life of bromazepam leading to increased accumulation of bromazepam.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> {{has been}} shown {{clinically}} to reduce the clearance of mirtazapine, imipramine, timolol, nebivolol, sparteine, loratadine, nortriptyline, gabapentin, and desipramine in humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> and {{grapefruit}} {{are known}} to increase blood plasma concentrations of benzodiazepines metabolized by the P450 CYP3A4 liver enzyme (e.g. alprazolam) by extending the time by which the drug leaves the body, effectively extending the half-life and enhancing effects to potentially toxic levels. Thus, given the similarities between zaleplon and benzodiazepines, particularly in effect, and not just chemical structure, {{it is reasonable to}} take precautions (e.g. inquire at a pharmacy) before one consumes <b>cimetidine</b> (or grapefruit) while also taking zaleplon.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> {{affects the}} {{metabolism}} of methadone, sometimes resulting in higher blood levels {{and a higher}} incidence of side effects, and may interact with the antimalarial medication hydroxychloroquine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine,</b> omeprazole, oxcarbazepine, ticlopidine, topiramate, ketoconazole, itraconazole, disulfiram, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, erythromycin, probenecid, propranolol, imipramine, ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine, and {{valproic acid}} prolong {{the action of}} {{diazepam}} by inhibiting its elimination.|$|E
25|$|Interactions of {{potential}} clinical importance with <b>cimetidine</b> include warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, carbamazepine, pethidine and other opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, terfenadine, amiodarone, flecainide, quinidine, fluorouracil, and benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests <b>cimetidine</b> could {{be effective in}} the treatment of common warts, but more rigorous double-blind clinical trials found it to be no more effective than a placebo.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> {{can also}} {{interact}} {{with a number}} of psychoactive medications, including tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, causing increased blood levels of these drugs and the potential of subsequent toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Like {{several other}} medications, {{the most obvious}} being erythromycin, <b>cimetidine</b> interferes with the body's metabolization of sildenafil, causing its {{strength}} and duration to increase (therefore also its side effects to be more likely and prominent).|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Tagamet among others, is a {{histamine}} H2 receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production. It is available over-the-counter and is mainly used {{in the treatment of}} heartburn and peptic ulcers.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{particular}} {{cases such as}} the use of <b>Cimetidine</b> to treat ulcers, a significant level of placebo response can also prove to be an index of how much the treatment has been directed at a wrong target.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> has a {{theoretical}} but unproven benefit in paracetamol toxicity. This is because N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a metabolite of paracetamol (acetaminophen) {{that is responsible}} for its hepatotoxicity, is formed from it by the cytochrome P450 system (specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4).|$|E
25|$|Clinically {{significant}} {{drug interactions}} with the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline, the CYP2C9 substrate tolbutamide, the CYP2D6 substrate desipramine, and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam have all been demonstrated with <b>cimetidine,</b> and interactions with other substrates of these enzymes are likely as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cimetidine</b> is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of tubular creatinine secretion. Creatinine is a metabolic byproduct of creatine breakdown. Accumulation of creatinine is associated with uremia, but the symptoms of creatinine accumulation are unknown, as they are hard to separate from other nitrogenous waste buildups.|$|E
25|$|Products {{containing}} multivalent cations, such as aluminium- or magnesium-containing antacids, {{and products}} containing calcium, iron or zinc invariably result in marked reduction of oral absorption of fluoroquinolones. Other drugs that interact with fluoroquinolones include sucralfate, probenecid, <b>cimetidine,</b> theophylline, warfarin, antiviral agents, phenytoin, cyclosporine, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and cycloserine.|$|E
25|$|H2 antagonists, {{sometimes}} referred to as H2RA-receptor antagonist from which later drugs were developed. <b>Cimetidine</b> was the culmination of a project at Smith, Kline & French (SK now GlaxoSmithKline) by James W. Black, C. Robin Ganellin, and others to develop a histamine receptor antagonist that would suppress stomach acid secretion.|$|E
