5|$|Ewell {{interpreted}} {{his orders}} as calling {{only for a}} cannonade. His 32 guns, along with A. P. Hill's 55 guns, engaged in a two-hour artillery barrage at extreme range that had little effect. Finally, about six o'clock, Ewell sent orders to each of his division <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> attack the Union lines in his front.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} the dead were buried in the St-Laurent-sur-Mer {{cemetery}} on 15 September 1942. The funeral was only attended by the local German and the French Gendarmarie <b>commanders.</b> <b>To</b> prevent anyone else from attending, the Germans had a machine gun set up covering the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|After Plunder the II Canadian Corps, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant General Guy Simonds, struck west and seized Emmerich, approaching the IJssel from the east. Crerar {{saw an opportunity}} to take Arnhem and open a route between the city and Zutphen to the north, and ordered his two Corps <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> coordinate their advances accordingly. However, he was wary of trying to seize Arnhem before the IJssel had been bridged further north.|$|E

5|$|As a Fatah field commander, {{he fought}} Israeli forces at the Battle of Karameh, gaining a {{reputation}} as an unyielding commander. Abu Ali Iyad was also a leading organizer and participant in guerrilla raids against Israeli localities. He {{was one of the}} last Palestinian <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> fight the Jordanian Army in the aftermath of the Black September conflict. He was killed in the countryside around Ajlun and Jerash by Jordanian forces in July 1971. His partisans claimed that he was executed, and as retaliation, they assassinated Jordanian prime minister Wasfi al-Tal four months after Abu Ali Iyad's death.|$|E
5|$|At Reims, Julian {{showed his}} {{characteristic}} boldness by deciding, in conference with his senior <b>commanders,</b> <b>to</b> {{deal with the}} Alamanni problem at source by marching straight to Alsace and restoring Roman control of the region. On the way, however, his army was ambushed and nearly destroyed at Decem Pagi (Dieuze) by a large German band who fell on two rearguard legions which had lost contact {{with the rest of}} the column in dense mist. They were rescued by auxilia palatina regiments that heard the uproar. Proceeding to Brotomagus (Brumath) in Alsace, Julian's army routed another German band in the field.|$|E
5|$|By early 1944, Allied {{submarines}} were sinking {{large numbers}} of Japanese ships. Their activities were frequently guided by 'Ultra' intelligence relating to ship movements which was collected by intercepting and decrypting encoded radio transmissions. The IJN routinely broadcast the location and intended route of convoys under its protection, and decrypting these messages allowed Allied naval <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> alert submarines {{in the vicinity of}} convoys. The submarine commanders were free to plan their interception and attack where conditions were most favorable.|$|E

5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was {{maintained}} by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces who adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.|$|E
5|$|The Germans responded {{quickly by}} redeploying their only reserve in the area, the 29th Panzergrenadier Division. Despite initial {{victories}} against Soviet armored forces, the Romanian collapse forced the division to again redeploy {{in an attempt}} to shore up defenses to the south. The 29th Panzergrenadier Division's counterattack had cost the Red Army around fifty tanks, and caused Soviet <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> worry about the safety of their left flank. However, the German division's redeployment meant {{that by the end of}} the day only the 6th Romanian Cavalry Regiment was positioned between advancing Soviet forces and the Don River.|$|E
5|$|Using radio {{messages}} Manekshaw {{addressed the}} Pakistani troops three {{times on the}} subject of surrender, assuring them that they would receive honourable treatment from the Indian troops. They were broadcast on 9, 11 and 15 December. The last two messages were delivered as replies to the messages from Major General Rao Farman Ali and Lieutenant General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi. These messages from the Pakistani <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> their troops were to have a devastating effect on their side, subsequently leading to their defeat. They convinced the troops of the pointlessness of further resistance.|$|E

5|$|After Christmas 1914, {{sporadic}} {{attempts were}} made at seasonal truces; a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a flag of truce on Easter Sunday 1915, but were warned off by the British opposite them, {{and later in the}} year, in November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> forestall any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the enemy line, whilst communicating with the enemy was discouraged by artillery barrages along the front line throughout the day. The prohibition was not completely effective, however, and a small number of brief truces occurred.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they failed}} to achieve their objectives, by nightfall the ANZACs had formed a beachhead, albeit much smaller than intended. In places they were {{clinging}} onto cliff faces with no organised defence system. Their precarious position convinced both divisional <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> ask for an evacuation, but after taking advice from the Royal Navy about how practicable that would be, the army commander decided they would stay. The exact number of the day's casualties is not known. The ANZACs had landed two divisions but over two thousand of their men had been killed or wounded, together {{with at least a}} similar number of Turkish casualties.|$|E
5|$|By 9 July, {{his ground}} forces had made {{significant}} gains in cutting off a vital road that connected Kaunas to Daugavpils. Taking advantage of this, Bagramyan worked with other Front <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> attack the rear guard of Army Group Center but poor coordination between the units led a stall in the advance. At this time, Bagramyan realized that German forces were most {{probably not going}} to easily retreat from the Baltics and so further advances towards Kaunas would be pointless. He proposed to STAVKA to launch a full-scale offensive towards Riga but the former rejected his plans, stating that the armies of Second and Third Baltic Fronts would have already pushed Army Group Center to Prussia {{by the time of the}} offensive. He attempted to convince them otherwise, citing the numerically deficient forces in the two Fronts, but was rebuffed and ordered to drive towards a road connecting the Lithuanian city of Šiauliai to Riga, resulting in its capture in late July.|$|E
50|$|On 30 June 1927, he was {{promoted}} from lieutenant <b>commander</b> <b>to</b> <b>commander.</b> On 31 December 1932, he {{was promoted}} from <b>commander</b> <b>to</b> captain. He was appointed a Commander of the Legion of Merit, a military award of the United States Armed Forces, and was granted unrestricted permission by the King to wear this award in 1946. In the 1945 New Year Honours, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).|$|R

5|$|Despite the Syrian superiority {{in numbers}} and equipment, the {{destruction}} of a multitude of armored vehicles and the infantry's failure to infiltrate Degania Alef was the likely cause for the retreat of the main Syrian force to Samakh (Tzemah). A less-organized and sparsely numbered armored and infantry force forked off to attack Degania Bet. Eight tanks, supported by mortar fire, moved within 400 yards of the settlement defense, where they stopped to provide fire support for an infantry attack. The Syrians made two failed attempts to breach the Israeli small arms fire defense and gave up the attempt. Against this force, the Israelis had about 80 people and one PIAT. The defenses in Degania Bet were disorganized and there were not enough trenches. They also had no communication link to the command, so Moshe Dayan sent one of his company <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> assess the situation.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to the Australian Army during the Second World War as Director of Medicine. He {{played an important role}} in the planning for the Battle of Greece, convincing the British Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Archibald Wavell to alter his campaign plan to reduce the danger from malaria. In the South West Pacific Area, Fairley became responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all allied forces in the fight against malaria and other tropical diseases. Fairley again sounded the alarm on the dangers of malaria, persuading authorities in the United States and United Kingdom to greatly step up production of anti-malarial drugs. Through the activities of the LHQ Medical Research Unit, he fast-tracked research into new drugs. Fairley convinced the Army of the efficacy of the new drug atebrin, and persuaded <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> adopt a tough approach to administering the drug to the troops.|$|E
5|$|Following {{break-out}} by the US 1st and 3rd Armies {{from the}} beachhead during the Battle of Normandy after Operation Cobra on 25 July 1944, Adolf Hitler ordered an immediate counterattack against Allied {{forces in the}} form of Operation Lüttich. Lieutenant General Omar Bradley—the commanding general of the US 12th Army Group—was notified of the counterattack in advance through signals intercepted via Ultra radio intercepts and deciphering and thus prepared his troops and their <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> defeat this counteroffensive and to encircle as much of the Wehrmacht force as possible. By the afternoon of 7 August, Operation Lüttich had been defeated by concerted, large-scale fighter-bomber air strikes against the German tanks and trucks. In the process, forces of the German 7th Army became further enveloped by the Allied advance out of Normandy.|$|E

5|$|Local {{units are}} called {{squadron}}s. A squadron is broken into flights. Squadrons {{are the main}} functioning body of Civil Air Patrol. Civil Air Patrol squadrons are designated as either cadet, senior, or composite squadrons. A CAP composite squadron consists of both cadets and senior members, who {{may be involved in}} any of the three missions of Civil Air Patrol. Composite squadrons have two deputy <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> assist the squadron commander: a Deputy Commander for Seniors and a Deputy Commander for Cadets. A senior squadron includes only senior members, who participate in the emergency services or aerospace education missions of Civil Air Patrol. A cadet squadron is largely made up of cadets, with a small number of senior members as necessary for supervision of cadets and the proper execution of the cadet program. Overseas squadrons operate independently of this structure, reporting directly to the National Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the Iraqi advance towards Khafji {{continued}} on this sector, despite repeated attacks from an AC-130. Attempts by the Saudi <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> call in additional air strikes on the advancing Iraqi column failed when the requested heavy air support never arrived. Khafji {{was occupied by}} approximately 00:30 on 30 January, trapping two six-man reconnaissance teams from the 1st Marine Division in the city. The teams occupied two apartment buildings in the southern sector {{of the city and}} called artillery fire on their position to persuade the Iraqis to call off a search of the area. Throughout the night, Coalition air support composed of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft continued to engage Iraqi tanks and artillery.|$|E
5|$|On March 23, 1943, {{he headed}} up a {{committee}} of USAAF and RAF <b>commanders</b> <b>to</b> draw up {{a plan for the}} Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO). Despite the fact that it altered the target system priorities outlined in AWPD-42, and changed the overall goal of the offensive from knocking Germany out of the war using airpower to one of preparing for the invasion of Europe, Hansell approved the designation of the German aircraft industry as its most important target and the destruction of the German Luftwaffe as its top priority. Hansell wrote the final draft of the CBO plan himself. Although Hansell did not personally participate in later strategic bombing operations against Germany, he had been instrumental in setting in motion the plans and policies that led to the near total destruction of German war industry.|$|E
