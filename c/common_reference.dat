5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E

5|$|On {{account of}} his caricature-like nature, Mitică survived in <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> beyond Caragiale's age. The {{character}} was portrayed by several actors, and most notably by Ştefan Iordache in the film De ce trag clopotele, Mitică?. In contemporary Romanian, his name {{was turned into a}} common noun, and often pluralized under the form mitici. During and after the 1990s, the terms surfaced in polemics surrounding Romania's centralism and the alternative projects for Transylvania's regional autonomy. In this context, it was used in reference to administrators from Bucharest or the Old Kingdom. In parallel, the term was adapted into a stereotype of modern Bucharesters and inhabitants of other regions over the Southern Carpathians, who are often portrayed as belonging to the Balkans, as opposed to the Central European traditions of Transylvania. Under these definitions, Mitică and mitici were notably present in essays authored by the Transylvanian activist Sabin Gherman.|$|E

25|$|The {{possibility}} of different {{interpretations of the}} Vedic literature, states Arvind Sharma, was recognized by ancient Indian scholars. The Brahmasutra (also called Vedanta Sutra, composed in 1st millennium BCE) accepted this in verse 1.1.4 and asserts {{the need for the}} Upanishadic teachings to be understood not in piecemeal cherrypicked basis, rather in a unified way wherein the ideas in the Vedic texts are harmonized with other means of knowledge such as perception, inference and remaining pramanas. This theme has been central to the Advaita school, making the Brahmasutra as a <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> and a consolidated textual authority for Advaita.|$|E
25|$|From the 15th century, {{northern}} Transnistria (current {{districts of}} Camenca and Rîbniţa) {{were part of}} the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and later to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1793) which encouraged the migration of peasants into the territory from the neighbouring populated areas (from north and from west). Prince of Moldavia George Ducas (1665–66, 1668–72, 1678–84) built a court at Țicanova on the east bank of the Dniester, and one at Nimirov on the Southern Bug, last mentioned in Moldavian hands in 1765. The localities Dubăsari, Rașcov, Vasilcău, as well as four other currently in Ukraine are mentioned in 17th–18th centuries as fairs for the Dniester-Bug region. In 1769, a document dated at Bender mentions the then title of the Mitropolitan of Moldavia as Mitropolitan of Proilavia, of Tamarova, of Hotin, and of all the borders of the Danube, of the Dniester, and the Han's Ukraine, the latter being a <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> to the then sparsely populated Dniester–Southern Bug–Dniepr area.|$|E

With concern to soil quality, only few European countries have adopted ERA for {{the definition of}} screening values and emediation targets. In particular. the application of ERA at site specific scale is still seldom included in the decisional process.

500|$|Wollstonecraft dedicates {{significant}} {{portions of}} Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark to descriptions {{of nature and}} her emotional responses to it. One of her most effective tactics is to associate a set of thoughts and feelings with a specific natural formation, such as the waterfall passage quoted above. Nature, Wollstonecraft assumes, is [...] "a <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> point" [...] between readers and herself, therefore her letters should generate a sense of social sympathy with them. Many of the letters contain these [...] "miniature Romantic excursus" [...] which illustrate Wollstonecraft's ideas regarding the connections between nature, God, and the self. The natural world becomes [...] "the necessary ground of speculation and the crucial field of experience".|$|E
500|$|Newsmakers {{believes}} that the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds helped define chamber pop as [...] "intimate, precisely arranged songs with rock's sweep but without its bluesy clamor." [...] Following the album was the group's unfinished 1966–67 work Smile, a collaboration between Brian Wilson and lyricist Van Dyke Parks that also heavily influenced the genre. According to the High Llama's Sean O'Hagan, Pet Sounds had been [...] "the beginning of the great pop experiment. But it wasn't allowed to continue, because rock and roll got hold {{of the whole thing}} and stopped it. Pop didn't take off again until this decade [...]" [...] Author Carl Wilson (no relation) says that Brian's [...] "pained vulnerability", [...] "uses of offbeat instruments", [...] "intricate harmonies", and [...] "the Smile saga itself" [...] became a <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> point for chamber pop bands. Just as ork-pop acts shared a love for Wilson, they also held an admiration for one another's work. In the late 1980s, the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for él Records also made sophisticated use of orchestras and voices that embodied and defined the chamber pop style.|$|E
500|$|<b>Common</b> <b>reference</b> points include {{various forms}} of 1980s music, {{including}} radio rock, new wave pop, MTV one-hit wonders, New Age music, synth-driven Hollywood blockbuster soundtracks, lounge music and easy-listening, [...] corporate muzak, lite rock [...] "schmaltz," [...] video game music, '80s synthpop and R. Recordings often used [...] "deliberately degraded" [...] or analog instruments and techniques, including tape hiss and FX. Also common {{was the use of}} outmoded audio/visual technology and DIY digital imagery, such as compact cassettes, VHS, CD-R discs, and early Internet aesthetics. The music is often issued in the form of limited-edition cassettes or vinyl records before reaching a wider audience through blogs and YouTube videos. Critic Adam Trainer notes its preoccupation with both decaying analog technology and bombastic representations of synthetic elements in 1980s and '90s popular culture. Trainer wrote that hypnagogic pop was defined by a shared [...] "musical approach" [...] rather than a particular sound, and that it draws from [...] "the collective unconscious of late 1980s and early 1990s popular culture" [...] while being [...] "indebted stylistically to various traditions of experimentalism such as noise, drone, repetition, and improvisation." [...] Hypnagogic pop was later described as an American counterpart to Britain's hauntological music scene, which also engaged with notions of nostalgia and memory.|$|E
