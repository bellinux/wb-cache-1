50|$|A final {{attempt to}} {{establish}} a coal cartel took place in 1904 {{with the formation of}} the Temple Iron Company. Prior to that time, the Temple Iron Company was a small concern that happened to have a broad charter allowing it to act as a holding company. The Reading, now out of receivership, purchased the company and brought the other coal railroads into the partnership, with the Reading owning 30%, the LVRR 23%, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western 20%, CNJ 17%, Erie 6%, and New York, Susquehanna and Western 5%. The purpose of the Temple Iron Company was to lock up independent coal production and control the supply. Congress reacted with the 1906 Hepburn Act, which among other things forbade railroads from owning the commodities that they transported. A long series of antitrust investigations and lawsuits resulted, culminating in a 1911 Supreme Court decision that forced the LVRR to divest itself of the coal companies it had held since 1868. The LVRR shareholders received shares of the now independent Lehigh Valley Coal Company, but the railroad no longer had management control of the production, <b>contracts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> of its largest customer.|$|E

40|$|Salmon farmers face an {{uncertain}} production environment and considerable price volatility, making planning a vital success criteria. This thesis describes {{the sources of}} uncertainty that are most important when planning sales, and demonstrates how this uncertainty can {{be taken into consideration}} by the use of stochastic programming. The basis for this thesis is the tactical planning problem of deciding when to harvest salmon and how to allocate sales between available <b>contracts</b> <b>and</b> <b>sales</b> in the spot market. Uncertainty relevant to the planning problem is described, and a multistage stochastic model that maximizes profit is proposed. The goal of the model is to provide salmon producers with a tool that can aid them in making profitable decisions regarding harvesting and future sales, by taking into account the uncertainty associated with biomass and price development. The model is implemented in three versions; a deterministic model, a two-stage stochastic model, and a multistage stochastic model. The implemented models are somewhat simplified, the most important simplification being that price is assumed deterministic in the stochastic models. This is done {{in order to make the}} stochastic models computationally tractable for a personal computer. All three models are written in Mosel, implemented in Xpress-IVE, and solved by the Xpress Optimizer. The implemented models are applied to Marine Harvest Region Mid, illustrating how the models can be used to solve a realistic salmon sales planning problem. In addition, a quantitative assessment of the gains from implementing a stochastic solution is demonstrated. The results obtained show that using the two-stage stochastic model provides almost no additional value over the deterministic model. For the multistage stochastic model, this value is substantially higher, though still marginal, largely due to the simplifications made in the implementation. Based on the simplifications made in the implemented models, possible extensions to the thesis are suggested. </p...|$|E
40|$|It is {{impossible}} to imagine the future of academic libraries without an extensive consideration of open access the removal of price and permission barriers from scholarly research online. As textbook and journal subscription prices continue to rise, improvements in technology make online dissemination of scholarship less expensive, and faculty recognize the practical and philosophical appeal of making their work available to wider audiences. As a consequences, libraries have begun to consider {{a wide variety of}} open access flavors and business models. These new possibilities have significant impact on both library services and collection policies, and the call for new skills within library staffing. Volume 9 of the series Creating the 21 st-Century Academic Library is the first of two addressing the topic of open access in academic libraries and focuses on policy and infrastructure for libraries that wish to provide leadership on their campus in the transition to more open forms of scholarship. Chapters in the book discuss how {{to make the case for}} open access on campus, as well as the political and policy implications of libraries that themselves want to become publishing entities. Infrastructure issues are also addressed including metadata standards and research management services. Also considered here is how interlibrary loan, preservation and the library s role in providing textbooks, support the concept of open access. It is hoped that this volume, and the series in general, will be a valuable and exciting addition to the discussions and planning surrounding the future directions, services, and careers in the 21 st-century academic library. " / The second of two in the series Creating the 21 st-Century Academic Library that deals with the topic of open access in academic libraries, focuses on the implementation of open access in academic libraries. Chapters on the legalities and practicalities of open access in academic libraries address the issues associated with copyright, licensing, and intellectual property and include support for courses that require open access distribution of student work. The topic of library services in support of open access is explored, including the library’s role in providing open educational resources, and as an ally and driver of their adoption, for example, by helping defray author fees that are required for open access articles. A detailed look at open access in the context of undergraduate research is provided and considers how librarians can engage undergraduates in conversations about open access. Chapters consider ways to engage undergraduate students in the use, understanding, evaluation, and creation of open access resources. Issues that are of concern to graduate students are also given some attention and central to these are the development of Electronic Thesis and Dissertation (ETD) programs. A chapter examines the library’s role in balancing greater access to graduate student work with the consequences of openness, such as concerns about book <b>contracts</b> <b>and</b> <b>sales,</b> plagiarism, and changes in scholarly research and production. The book concludes with issues surrounding open data and library services in critical data librarianship, including advocacy, preservation, and instruction. It is hoped that this volume, and the series in general, will be a valuable and exciting addition to the discussions and planning surrounding the future directions, services, and careers in the 21 st-century academic library...|$|E
