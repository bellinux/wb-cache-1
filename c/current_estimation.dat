40|$|AbstractFuzzy {{systems have}} been used {{extensively}} and successfully in control systems {{over the past few}} decades, but have been applied much less often to filtering problems. This is somewhat surprising in view of the dual relationship between control and estimation. This paper discusses and demonstrates the application of fuzzy filtering to motor winding <b>current</b> <b>estimation</b> in permanent magnet synchronous motors. Motor winding <b>current</b> <b>estimation</b> is an important problem because in order to implement effective closed-loop control, a good estimation of the current is needed. Motor winding currents are notoriously noisy because of electrical noise in the motor drive. We use a fuzzy system with correlation-product inference and centroid defuzzification for motor winding <b>current</b> <b>estimation.</b> With the assumption that the membership functions are triangular (but not necessarily symmetric), we then optimize the membership functions using gradient descent. Next we use singular value decomposition to reduce the rule base for the fuzzy filter. Rule base reduction can be important for fuzzy systems in those cases where the fuzzy system needs to be implemented in real time. This is especially true with regard to fuzzy filtering in a real time motor controller. The methods discussed in this paper are demonstrated on real motor winding currents that were collected with a digital oscilloscope. It is demonstrated that fuzzy techniques provide a feasible approach to motor <b>current</b> <b>estimation,</b> that gradient descent optimization improves the performance of the filter, and that rule base reduction results in a relatively small degradation of filter performance...|$|E

40|$|Malaria is a {{parasitic}} disease {{that is a}} major health problem in many tropical regions. The most characteristic symptom of malaria is fever. The fraction of fevers that are attributable to malaria, the malaria attributable fever fraction (MAFF), is an important public health measure for assessing the effect of malaria control programs and other purposes. Estimating the MAFF is not straightforward {{because there is no}} gold standard diagnosis of a malaria attributable fever; an individual can have malaria parasites in her blood and a fever, but the individual may have developed partial immunity that allows her to tolerate the parasites and the fever is being caused by another infection. We define the MAFF using the potential outcome framework for causal inference and show what assumptions underlie <b>current</b> <b>estimation</b> methods. <b>Current</b> <b>estimation</b> methods rely on an assumption that the parasite density is correctly measured. However, this assumption does not generally hold because (i) fever kills some parasites and (ii) the measurement of parasite density has measurement error. In the presence of these problems, we show <b>current</b> <b>estimation</b> methods do not perform well. We propose a novel maximum likelihood estimation method based on exponential family g-modeling. Under the assumption that the measurement error mechanism and the magnitude of the fever killing effect are known, we show that our proposed method provides approximately unbiased estimates of the MAFF in simulation studies. A sensitivity analysis can be used {{to assess the impact of}} different magnitudes of fever killing and different measurement error mechanisms. We apply our proposed method to estimate the MAFF in Kilombero, Tanzania. Comment: 39 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

In this paper, a solution for inductor parameters online identification is investigated. A small signal injection strategy is proposed to create a transient state, and convergence problem of inductance identification in steady state can be avoided. Then a charge balance current observer (CBCO), derived from capacitor current charging balance concept, is adopted to estimate the inductor current for inductance identification. Since inductance is not used in CBCO, <b>current</b> <b>estimation</b> is not affected by inductance identification error. Because of rank-deficient problem, instead of identifying inductor parasitic resistance solely, the inductor equivalent parasitic resistance is derived.

40|$|Nowadays, {{verification}} of {{digital integrated circuit}} has been focused more and more from the timing and area field to <b>current</b> and power <b>estimations.</b> The main problem {{with this kind of}} verification is on the lack of precision of <b>current</b> <b>estimations</b> when working at higher levels (logic, RT, architectural levels). To solve this problem it is not only necessary to use good current models for switching activity but, also, it is necessary to calculate this switching activity with high accuracy. In this paper we present an alternative to estimate current consumption using logic-level simulation. To do that, we use a simple but accurate enough current model to calculate the current consumption for each signal transition, and a delay model that obtains high accuracy when it is used to measure the switching activity (the Degradation Delay Model -DDM-). In the paper we present the current model for CMOS inverter, the characterization process and the model implementation in the logic simulator HALOTIS that includes the DDM.
