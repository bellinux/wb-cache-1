5|$|In August 1972, Bushnell and Alcorn {{installed}} the Pong prototype {{at a local}} bar, Andy Capp's Tavern. They selected the bar because of their good working relation with the bar's manager, Bill Gaddis; Atari supplied pinball machines to Gaddis. Bushnell and Alcorn placed the prototype {{on one of the}} tables near the other entertainment machines: a jukebox, pinball machines, and Computer Space. The game was well received the first night and its popularity continued to grow over the next one and a half weeks. Bushnell then went on a business trip to Chicago to demonstrate Pong to executives at Bally and Midway Manufacturing; he intended to use Pong to fulfill his contract with Bally, rather than the driving game. A few days later, the prototype began exhibiting technical issues and Gaddis contacted Alcorn to fix it. Upon inspecting the machine, Alcorn discovered that the problem was the <b>coin</b> <b>mechanism</b> was overflowing with quarters.|$|E

2500|$|When any {{of these}} sensors is activated, the game {{registers}} a [...] "tilt" [...] and locks out, disabling solenoids for the flippers and other playfield systems so that the ball can do nothing other than roll down the playfield directly to the drain. A tilt will usually result in loss of bonus points earned by the player during that ball; the game ends if it's the last ball and the player has no extra ball. Older games would immediately end {{the ball in play}} on a tilt. Modern games give tilt warnings before sacrificing the ball in play. The number of tilt warnings can be adjusted by the operator of the machine. Until recently most games also had a [...] "slam tilt" [...] switch which guarded against kicking or slamming the <b>coin</b> <b>mechanism,</b> or for overly aggressive behavior with the machine, which could give a false indication that a coin had been inserted, thereby giving a free game or credit. This feature was recently taken out by default in new Stern S.A.M System games, but can be added as an option. A slam tilt will typically end the current game for all players.|$|E

In general, the ride is powered by a low-voltage current passing through the tracks but sometimes the rides are powered by batteries. Most versions of these rides are specifically designed to carry younger children, due to the low-voltage used and the size of the ride, although it is possible to find bigger models designed for older children.|$|E

5000|$|Mutoscopes were {{a popular}} feature of {{amusement}} arcades and pleasure piers in the UK until {{the introduction of}} decimal coinage in 1971. The <b>coin</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were difficult to convert, and many machines were subsequently destroyed; some were exported to Denmark where pornography had recently been legalised. The typical arcade installation included multiple machines offering a mixture of fare. Both {{in the early days}} and during the revival, that mixture usually included [...] "girlie" [...] reels which ran the gamut from risqué to outright soft-core pornography. It was, however, common for these reels to have suggestive titles that implied more than the reel actually delivered.

50|$|Coin slots, coin {{returns and}} the coin box, which {{allow for the}} {{exchange}} of money or tokens. They are usually below the control panel. Very often, translucent red plastic buttons are placed in between the coin return and the coin slot. When they are pressed, a coin or token that has become jammed in the <b>coin</b> <b>mechanism</b> is returned to the player. See coin acceptor. Early coin slots could be defeated using a piezo-electric gas fire or gas oven igniter held against the steel bodywork of the cabinet, thus enabling free credits to be obtained. In some arcades, the coin slot is replaced with a card reader that reads data from a game card bought from the arcade operator.|$|E
50|$|The piano had 44 notes, {{half the}} number of keys found on a normal piano keyboard. It was played by regular hammers using a {{standard}} player piano action. The hammers were activated by electromagnets. The piano frame was made of iron, shaped like a shield, and symmetrically strung. The bass strings were at {{the centre of the}} frame and the treble strings radiated out to the edges from the centre. This arrangement distributed the string pressure more evenly across the frame and helped keep the piano in tune.The Violano-Virtuoso was coin-operated and its mechanism was capable of holding up to 15 coins.

5000|$|Payphones were {{preceded by}} pay stations, manned by {{telephone}} company attendants who would collect rapid payment for calls placed. The Connecticut Telephone Co. reportedly had a payphone in their New Haven office beginning 1 June 1880; the fee was handed to an attendant. In 1889, a public telephone with a coin-pay mechanism was {{installed at the}} Hartford Bank in Hartford, Connecticut by the Southern New England Telephone Co. It was a [...] "post-pay" [...] machine; coins were inserted {{at the end of}} a conversation. The <b>coin</b> <b>mechanism</b> was invented by William Gray; he was issued a series of patents for his devices, beginning with US#454470 issued 23 Jun 1891 for a 'Signal Device for Telephone Pay-Stations' which rang a bell for each coin inserted.

50|$|Many casinos have {{eliminated}} {{the use of}} metal tokens (and coins) in their slot machines, in favor of paper receipts or pre-paid cards, which, while requiring heavy infrastructure costs to install, eliminate the coin handling expenses, jamming problems encountered in machines which took coins or tokens and can allow more game-specific technology {{in the space of}} a machine which would usually be dedicated to <b>coin</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> While some casinos (such as the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas) which installed the receipt system had kept the $1 tokens around for use as $1 chips, most other casinos using the receipts had simply scrapped the tokens entirely. Most casinos using receipts have automated machines at which customers may redeem receipts, eliminating the need for coin counting windows and decreasing labor costs.Casino chip collecting is a part of numismatics, more specifically as specialized exonumia collecting. This hobby has become increasingly popular with the Casino Chips & Gaming Tokens Collectors Club formed in 1988. Some collectors may value certain casino tokens up to $100,000, which are typically traded on online auction websites like eBay. Several casinos sell custom-made sets of chips and one or two decks of cards stamped with the name of the casino on them. Each set is contained in a small briefcase or box.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1950s, Houghtaling {{was still}} working as a salesman, this time selling {{vibrating}} beds in which the vibrating motor and bed were sold as a single unit that was clumsy, expensive, and prone to failure. At a service call for a broken unit, Houghtaling realized that the vibrating motor was the essential component, not the bed, and that a unit could be developed that would attach to any bed, not just the combination vibrating bed units he was selling. Houghtaling worked {{in the basement of}} his Glen Rock, New Jersey, home and tested hundreds of motors before finding one that weighed relatively little, could be attached to the box springs of an existing bed, and would provide the right level of vibration. Once a quarter was inserted into the attached coin meter, the motor would vibrate the bed for 15 minutes. The <b>coin</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were modeled on similar devices that had been attached to radios and televisions in hotels. [...] The devices were sold through franchisees who installed the units in hotels based on an arrangement in which revenues would be split, with $1 million in annual sales of the units. There were 250,000 Magic Fingers units installed nationwide at their peak of popularity in the 1960s, with each unit averaging eight quarters per week, bringing in $2 million in monthly gross revenue.|$|R
5000|$|A {{second example}} among {{vertebrates}} is the marsupial species Sminthopsis macrour, which use a torpor strategy {{in order to}} reduce their metabolic rate to survive environmental changes. Reproductive hormone cycles have been shown to mediate the timing of torpor and reproduction, and in mice have been shown to mediate this process entirely, heedless to the environment. In the marsupial species, however, an adaptive <b>coin</b> flipping <b>mechanism</b> is employed where neither torpor nor reproduction are affected by manipulation of hormones, suggesting that this marsupial species makes a more active decision about when to use torpor that is better-suited to the uncertain environment in which it lives.|$|R

40|$|Following {{the recent}} {{discovery}} of new Brucella strains from different animal species {{and from the}} environment, ten Brucella species are nowadays included in the genus Brucella. Although the intracellular trafficking of Brucella is well described, the strategies developed by Brucella to survive and multiply in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, particularly to access nutriments during its intracellular journey, are still largely unknown. Metabolism and virulence of Brucella are now considered to be {{two sides of the}} same <b>coin.</b> <b>Mechanisms</b> presiding to the colonization of the pregnant uterus in different animal species are not known. Vaccination is the cornerstone of control programs in livestock and although the S 19, RB 51 (both in cattle) and Rev 1 (in sheep and goats) vaccines have been successfully used worldwide, they have drawbacks and thus the ideal brucellosis vaccine is still very much awaited. There is no vaccine available for pigs and wildlife. Animal brucellosis control strategies differ in the developed and the developing world. Most emphasis is put on eradication and on risk analysis to avoid the re-introduction of Brucella in the developed world. Information related to the prevalence of brucellosis is still scarce in the developing world and control programs are rarely implemented. Since there is no vaccine available for humans, prevention of human brucellosis relies on its control in the animal reservoir. Brucella is also considered to be an agent to be used in bio- and agroterrorism attacks. At the animal/ecosystem/human interface it is critical to reduce opportunities for Brucella to jump host species as already seen in livestock, wildlife and humans. This task is a challenge for the future in terms of veterinary public health, as for wildlife and ecosystem managers and will need a "One Health" approach to be successful. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The main problems in development were making modifications to the fission core in order to accept the gas correctly without reducing its own efficiency. The 1951 test was primarily to test the nuclear principles involved, and to gain research data, and it was not considered a design for a weaponizable device.

500|$|The metal is {{occasionally}} used in coins; until 2000, {{the only}} United States coin to use manganese was the [...] from 1942 to 1945.

However, because of shortage of nickel metal during the war, it was substituted by more available silver and manganese, thus resulting in an alloy of 56% copper, 35% silver and 9% manganese. Since 2000, dollar coins, for example the Sacagawea dollar and the Presidential $1 coins, are made from a brass containing 7% of manganese with a pure copper core. In both cases of nickel and dollar, the use of manganese in the coin was to duplicate the electromagnetic properties of a previous identically sized and valued <b>coin</b> in the <b>mechanisms</b> of vending machines.

40|$|A large {{variety of}} {{antimicrobial}} peptides {{have been shown}} to act, at least in vitro, by poration of the lipid membrane. The nanometre size of these pores, however, complicates their structural characterization by experimental techniques. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations, to study the interaction of a specific class of antimicrobial peptides, melittin, with a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer in atomic detail. We show that transmembrane pores spontaneously form above a critical peptide to lipid ratio. The lipid molecules bend inwards to form a toroidally shaped pore but with only one or two peptides lining the pore. This is in strong contrast to the traditional models of toroidal pores in which the peptides are assumed to adopt a transmembrane orientation. We find that peptide aggregation, either prior or after binding to the membrane surface, is a prerequisite to pore formation. The presence of a stable helical secondary structure of the peptide, however is not. Furthermore, results obtained with modified peptides point to the importance of electrostatic interactions in the poration process. Removing the charges of the basic amino-acid residues of melittin prevents pore formation. It was also found that in the absence of counter ions pores not only form more rapidly but lead to membrane rupture. The rupture process occurs via a novel recursive poration pathway, which we <b>coin</b> the Droste <b>mechanism.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{electronically}} accessible {{information has been}} growing exponentially. How to effectively use this information has become a significant challenge. A post 9 / 11 study indicated that the deficiency of semantic interoperability technology hindered the ability to integrate information from disparate sources in a meaningful and timely fashion to allow for preventive precautions. Meanwhile, organizations that provided useful services by combining and reusing information from publicly accessible sources have been legally challenged. The Database Directive has been introduced in the European Union and six legislative proposals {{have been made in}} the U. S. to provide legal protection for non-copyrightable database contents, but the Directive and the proposals have differing and sometimes conflicting scope and strength, which creates legal uncertainty for valued-added data reuse practices. The need for clearer data reuse policy will become more acute as information integration technology improves to make integration much easier. This Thesis takes an interdisciplinary approach to addressing both the technology and the policy challenges, identified above, in the effective use and reuse of information from disparate sources. (cont.) The technology component builds upon the existing Context Interchange (COIN) framework for large-scale semantic interoperability. We focus on the problem of temporal semantic heterogeneity where data sources and receivers make time-varying assumptions about data semantics. A collection of time-varying assumptions are called a temporal context. We extend the existing COIN representation formalism to explicitly represent temporal contexts, and the <b>COIN</b> reasoning <b>mechanism</b> to reconcile temporal semantic heterogeneity in the presence of semantic heterogeneity of time. We also perform a systematic and analytic evaluation of the flexibility and scalability of the COIN approach. Compared with several traditional approaches, the COIN approach has much greater flexibility and scalability. For the policy component, we develop an economic model that formalizes the policy instruments in one of the latest legislative proposals in the U. S. The model allows us to identify the circumstances under which legal protection for non-copyrightable content is needed, the different conditions, and the corresponding policy choices. (cont.) Our analysis indicates that depending on the cost level of database creation, the degree of differentiation of the reuser database, and the efficiency of policy administration, the optimal policy choice can be protecting a legal monopoly, encouraging competition via compulsory licensing, discouraging voluntary licensing, or even allowing free riding. The results provide useful insights for the formulation of a socially beneficial database protection policy. by Hongwei Zhu. Thesis (Ph. D.)
