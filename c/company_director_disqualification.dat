5000|$|The normal {{approach}} to wrongful trading actions {{is that the}} liquidator will try to establish a date at which the company can {{be shown to be}} balance sheet insolvent, and then show why it was unreasonable for directors to continue to trade after this. In the UK, and contrary to many misconceptions, it is not an offence to trade a company while it is insolvent. Indeed, in some situations, if the directors genuinely believe that the position will be turned around and the position of creditors will improve, it is the correct thing to do. When it becomes wrongful trading is when it should have been realised that the position of the creditors was likely to deteriorate from that position onwards and that the company would proceed into liquidation. Once a director realises that his or her company is insolvent, one important thing for him to do is to seek immediate professional advice from a licensed insolvency practitioner. All directors who continue as <b>directors</b> of a <b>company</b> trading while insolvent may face <b>disqualification</b> under the <b>Company</b> <b>Directors</b> <b>Disqualification</b> Act 1986.

25|$|Over the 20th century, {{companies}} in the UK became the dominant organisational form of economic activity, which raised concerns about how accountable those who controlled companies were to those who invested in them. The first reforms following the Great Depression, in the Companies Act 1948, ensured that directors could be removed by shareholders with a simple majority vote. In 1977, the government's Bullock Report proposed reform to allow employees to participate in selecting the board of directors, as was happening across Europe, exemplified by the German Codetermination Act 1976. However the UK never implemented the reforms, and from 1979 the debate shifted. Although making directors more accountable to employees was delayed, the Cork Report led to stiffer sanctions in the Insolvency Act 1986 and the <b>Company</b> <b>Directors</b> <b>Disqualification</b> Act 1986 against directors who negligently ran companies at a loss. Through the 1990s the focus in corporate governance turned toward internal control mechanisms, such as auditing, separation of the chief executive position from the chair, and remuneration committees {{as an attempt to}} place some check on excessive executive pay. These rules applicable to listed companies, now found in the UK Corporate Governance Code, have been complemented by principles based regulation of institutional investors' activity in company affairs. At the same time, the UK's integration in the European Union meant a steadily growing body of EU Company Law Directives and case law to harmonise company law within the internal market.|$|R
40|$|Under the {{proposed}} {{amendments to the}} <b>Company</b> <b>Directors</b> <b>Disqualification</b> Act 1986, as per s. 15 A–C, the Secretary of State may apply to the court to seek a compensation order, {{for the benefit of}} creditors of an insolvent <b>company,</b> against a <b>director</b> subject to a disqualification order or undertaking. Alternatively, a director may give a compensation undertaking to the Secretary of State in order to avoid court proceedings. This paper argues, contrary to the view that the reformed measures will significantly enhance the arsenal of the unsecured creditor in the war against unfit and delinquent directors, that the compensation order may ultimately prove to be, for the most part, a state-manufactured tool for the recovery of state- owed debts. The paper will evaluate various sources of empirical data, including the author’s own survey of disqualified directors based on Insolvency Service and Companies House data, to argue that the scope for the recovery of a significant proportion of unsecured debt owed to the ‘private’ creditor is limited. The paper will also demonstrate how this argument is compounded when considering the demographic of those who are actively being disqualified under the existing legislation. Further, the paper will identify the potential for the emergence of a system that may in practice elevate (and {{in the case of the}} Crown, re-elevate) a previously unsecured creditor to one that is preferred, under the guise of compensation and contrary to the pari passu doctrine. It will also be suggested, in any case, that the introduction of a scheme of compensation into the realm of disqualification stands at odds with the rationale behind it as being predominantly for the protection of the public. Instead, such a system only reaffirms the view that disqualification serves to punish the individual...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the objectives {{and success of}} the <b>disqualification</b> of <b>directors</b> under section 6 of the <b>Company</b> <b>Directors</b> <b>Disqualification</b> Act 1986. Disqualification under that provision {{is central to the}} state's strategy for dealing with undesirable conduct by directors. However, the objectives of disqualification under section 6 are unclear and is effectiveness can be contested. It is frequently stated that disqualification exists to 'protect the public and commercial' world from abuse of limited liability yet the precise nature of the harm that such abuse causes has not been conclusively determined. As such, some have argued that disqualification seeks to sanction conduct that is 'socially undesirable'. This thesis set out to establish the nature of the harm that makes certain uses of limited liability undesirable. It argues that the harm the state seeks to eschew through its use of section 6 is conduct likely to result in financial loss to creditors. Consequently it is argued that section 6 exists to control a moral hazard created by the state's policy of allowing entrepreneurs free access to limited liability. Having established that a reduction in financial loss is the objective of section 6, the thesis processes to evaluate whether the section is likely to bring about a benefit (in terms of reduced loss) that is greater than the costs it generates. It is argued that disqualification under section 6 fails to bring about a meaningful reduction in losses generated by 'unfit' directs. However, it is also contended that there are significant costs associated with the application of the sanction. Consequently, the thesis contends that section 6 is an inefficient method of seeking to control undesirable conduct by directors. The thesis concludes that the failure of disqualification to provide effective protection from the moral hazard created by limited liability ought to necessitate a review state's policy of allowing free access to it. For, in so far as regulation exists to protect the public from abuse of limited liability, the state must feel that its policy creates losses that are unacceptable. Therefore the failure of that regulation ought to necessitate a review of the policy as the most desirable way of protecting the public from the harm inflicted by undesirable use of limited liability.

40|$|Encouraging {{entrepreneurship}} {{and trade}} by permitting {{free access to}} limited liability is a cornerstone emblem of UK enterprise policy. However, it comes at a price. The abuse of limited liability by dishonest, unscrupulous, incompetent, negligent, and occasionally deranged directors, who drive a company into insolvency – and the potential {{that it has to}} wreak financial havoc upon unsuspecting creditors – is all too well known. Yet, the state’s response to this abuse is not to limit access to limited liability. Instead, it has been, over a number of years, to create a wide-ranging regulatory regime in an effort to crack down on directorial misconduct. The mechanisms employed by the state for this purpose can crudely be split into two camps: ‘private’ and ‘public’ enforcement mechanisms. Those in the former category are powers of an insolvency officeholder under the Insolvency Act 1986, and have the primary effect of compensating creditors for misconduct that they have suffered at the hands of delinquent directors. This thesis turns its focus on wrongful and fraudulent trading. Public enforcement in this context means directors’ disqualification, pursuant to the <b>Company</b> <b>Directors</b> <b>Disqualification</b> Act 1986. The need for regulation, whether public and private, is shown to arise as a result of moral hazards created by this laissez-faire approach to accessing limited liability. The regulatory regime and limited liability are therefore inextricably linked. With that in mind, the thesis explores how effective these mechanisms are in preventing abuse. Effectiveness here is determined with reference to the original rationale and underpinning objectives of each respective mechanism. The thesis will however not confine itself to a doctrinal analysis of the mechanisms in pursuit of that aim. It will go further and introduce substantial empirical data, so as to understand their operation ‘on the ground’ insofar as is possible. It will be shown that each mechanism suffers its own significant difficulties which are inhibitive of their overall effectiveness. Ultimately the author will express the view that none of the mechanisms discussed appear to be working as intended. The thesis examines the recent reforms to this area following the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015, but asserts that in reality {{they are likely to be}} of minimal significance. The final part of the thesis criticises the approach of the state in adopting an ex post facto system of regulation in the first place. It argues it to be misguided and inevitably resigned to at least partial failure because it does not deal with the underlying problem. The thesis therefore comes full circle in its conclusions by proposing for consideration a new, ex ante, alternative that deals with the issues at source: the curtailment of access to limited liability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{focus of}} this paper is on the {{deterrence}} of ‘hard core’ cartels through appropriate sanctions. The UK has the toughest provisions in the EU, with a dual system of administrative regulation and fines directed at firms and penalties, including criminal proceedings, targeted at the individuals involved. The paper considers experiences since the introduction of personal criminal sanctions for the UK's ‘cartel offence’ under the Enterprise Act 2002. Although an enforcement lag was to be expected, the threat of criminal sanctions against individuals to date has seemed more apparent than real. Problems in applying the policy are identified through an assessment in terms of the necessary prerequisites for the successful criminalisation of antitrust offences proposed by Wils (2005) and ongoing developments in the UK are discussed. The findings shed some light on the difficulties of introducing effective criminal sanctions on individual cartel behaviour at Member State level and suggest more general consideration be given to non criminal <b>director</b> <b>disqualifications.</b> UK Competition Policy, Cartels, Cartel Offence, Criminalisation, Criminal Sanctions, <b>Director</b> <b>Disqualification,</b> D 21, L 41, K 14, K 21,...|$|R
