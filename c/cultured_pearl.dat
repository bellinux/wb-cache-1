25|$|Pearl {{farmers can}} culture a pearl {{by placing a}} nucleus, usually a piece of {{polished}} mussel shell, inside the oyster. In three to seven years, the oyster can produce a perfect pearl. These pearls are not as valuable as natural pearls, but look exactly the same. In fact, {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century, when several researchers discovered how to produce artificial pearls, the <b>cultured</b> <b>pearl</b> market has far outgrown the natural pearl market.|$|E
25|$|Zubarah was {{the focal}} point of an {{extensive}} regional trade network during its peak in the late eighteenth century. Until the introduction of the <b>cultured</b> <b>pearl</b> in the early 1900s, the trade in pearls constituted the Persian Gulf’s most important industry, employing up to a third of the male population in the region. Zubarah, being one of the focal pearling and trading towns, contributed to the geopolitical, social, and cultural trajectories of Gulf history which shape the region today.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> are the {{response}} of the shell to a tissue implant. A tiny piece of mantle tissue (called a graft) from a donor shell is transplanted into a recipient shell, causing a pearl sac to form into which the tissue precipitates calcium carbonate. There are a number of methods for producing cultured pearls: using freshwater or seawater shells, transplanting the graft into the mantle or into the gonad, and adding a spherical bead as a nucleus. Most saltwater <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> are grown with beads. Tradenames of <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> are Akoya, white or golden South sea, and black Tahitian. Most beadless <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> are mantle-grown in freshwater shells in China, and are known as freshwater <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Natural and <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> can be {{distinguished}} from imitation pearls using a microscope. Another method of testing for imitations is to rub two pearls against each other. Imitation pearls are completely smooth, but natural and <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> are composed of nacre platelets, making both feel slightly gritty.|$|R

The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the Second World War, when the newly independent Government of India imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.

The First World War had a severe impact on the pearl fishery, but it was the Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the Japanese invention of the <b>cultured</b> <b>pearl,</b> that all but destroyed it. The industry eventually faded away shortly after the Second World War, when the newly independent Government of India imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The decline of pearling resulted in a very difficult era, with little opportunity to build any infrastructure.|$|E

Donna Chambers Designs was established in 1981 to create and manufacture 14-karat gold and <b>cultured</b> <b>pearl</b> fine jewelry. [...] Later a line of porcelain cameos featuring African American women were added {{as well as a}} line of antique mother-of-pearl Chinese gambling chips further enhanced with pearls. The poker chips, which form the centerpieces of bracelets, earrings and pendants, date from the Ching Dynasty and typically bear family crests or initials {{on one side and a}} drawing engraved with some aspect of Chinese life on the other. Chambers came across the poker chips by accident. [...] "I'm known as the pearl lady....My work has always been of pearl, whether freshwater or cultured. I use a lot of mother of pearl, abalone, and mabes. I was in Tuscon ... and I did a double take," [...] Chambers said, [...] "I saw these mother-of-pearl, beautiful carved pieces...I picked up a few and made two or three pins with them." [...] The positive reaction to the gambling chip jewelry was so strong that they have become her signature jewelry line. Both Lonnie Anderson and Cissy Houston have purchased pearls from Chambers’ line.|$|E

50|$|When a <b>cultured</b> <b>pearl</b> with a bead nucleus is X-rayed, {{it reveals}} a {{different}} structure {{to that of}} a natural pearl (see diagram).

A beadless <b>cultured</b> <b>pearl</b> (whether of freshwater or saltwater origin) may show growth rings, but also a complex central cavity, witness of the first precipitation of the young pearl sac.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> took {{much of the}} chance, risk, and guesswork out of the pearl industry, allowing it to become stable and predictable, and fostering its rapid growth over the past 100 years. Today, more than 99% of all pearls sold worldwide are <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls.</b> Colored Pearls, which occur due to local chemicals inside the shell, {{much in the way}} of rubies or sapphires, can be made by inserting natural dyes into the mussel shell, e.g., cobalt chloride to create a pinkish color.|$|R
50|$|A well-equipped gem testing {{laboratory}} can distinguish natural <b>pearls</b> from <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls</b> by using gemological X-ray equipment {{to examine the}} center of a pearl.

50|$|The {{original}} Japanese <b>cultured</b> <b>pearls,</b> {{known as}} akoya pearls, {{are produced by}} a species of small pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata, which is no bigger than 6 to 8 cm in size, hence akoya pearls larger than 10 mm in diameter are extremely rare and highly priced.

Western Australia is the main pearl-producing state, with The Pearl Producers Association (PPA) acting as the state’s peak representative body for the Pinctada maxima pearl oyster culture industry.
