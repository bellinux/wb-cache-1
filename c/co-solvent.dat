40|$|AbstractThe {{accumulation}} of organic <b>co-solvents</b> in cells {{is a basic}} strategy for organisms from various species to increase stress tolerance in extreme environments. Widespread representatives of this class of <b>co-solvents</b> are trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and betaine; these small molecules are able to stabilize the native conformation of proteins and prevent their aggregation. Despite their importance, detailed experimental studies {{on the impact of}} these <b>co-solvents</b> on the energy landscape of proteins have not yet been carried out. We use single-molecule spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures to examine the influence of these physiological relevant <b>co-solvents</b> on photosystem I (PSI) from Thermosynechococcus elongatus. In contrast to PSI ensemble spectra, which are almost unaffected by the addition of TMAO and betaine, statistical analysis of the fluorescence emission from individual PSI trimers yields insight into the interaction of the <b>co-solvents</b> with PSI. The results show an increased homogeneity upon addition of TMAO or betaine. The number of detectable zero-phonon lines (ZPLs) is reduced, indicating spectral diffusion processes with faster rates. In the framework of energy landscape model these findings indicate that <b>co-solvents</b> lead to reduced barrier heights between energy valleys, and thus efficient screening of protein conformations can take place...|$|R

40|$|Quarternary {{lithium-ion}} battery electrolyte solutions containing ester <b>co-solvents</b> in mixtures of carbonates {{have been demonstrated}} to have high conductivity at low temperatures (< - 20 C). However, {{in some cases the}} presence of such <b>co-solvents</b> does not directly translate into improved low temperature cell performance, presumably due to the formation of ionically resistive surface films on carbonaceous anodes. In order to understand this behavior, a number of lithium-graphite cells have been studied containing electrolytes with various ester <b>co-solvents,</b> including methyl acetate (MA), ethyl acetate (EA), ethyl propionate (EP), and ethyl butyrate (EB).

30|$|SC) may be {{obtained}} due to the improved light harvesting, the associated large surface/volume ratio of nanostructured Si may cause poor contact between Si and PEDOT:PSS and then serious surface recombination in the hybrid solar cells. What is more, the cost will be increased with complex nanostructure Si fabrication. On the other hand, {{it has been reported}} that the conductivity and the contact between PEDOT:PSS and Si could be improved by adding organic <b>co-solvents</b> and non-ionic surfactant, respectively. It has been reported that improvement of surface conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films could been received by acid treatments like formic acid treatment and nitric acid treatment [21, 22]. But acid treatment is too violent for the PEDOT:PSS films and may take adverse effects to the device stability. It is well known that PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersion is made up of a certain concentration of PSS added to PEDOT. But the insulating PSS that contains sulfonic acid SO 3 H groups may bring detrimental effects such as low conductivity and lifetime issues. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylene glycol (EG) are commonly used as <b>co-solvents</b> to modify the morphology and nanostructure of PEDOT:PSS, and the conductivity could be significantly improved compared to that with other <b>co-solvents</b> [23, 24]. However, it is worth noting that although the morphological structure across the PEDOT:PSS thin film may be modified by the addition of <b>co-solvents,</b> the negative effects brought by PSS still remain, which means the performance of the hybrid solar cells could be further improved.|$|R
30|$|Besides {{the volume}} the pH, osmolality, {{viscosity}} and addition of <b>co-solvents</b> are critical factors for substance administration [31, 32]. The recommended pH range for intravenous administration is 2 – 9.

Intraperitoneal administration is more sensitive to non-physiological conditions than intravenous administration where the injected volume is immediately diluted and buffered by the blood pool. For intraperitoneal administration, the pH should be physiological and vehicles limited to saline or water. Tolerated <b>co-solvents</b> for intraperitoneal administration include propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400).|$|R

40|$|In many {{applications}} related to Supercritical-Fluid (SCF) technology, solids are dissolved in SC fluids. Experimental data {{are now available}} for many systems but cannot cover all cases of potential practical interest. The prediction of solid solubilities in SC fluids, often {{in the presence of}} <b>co-solvents,</b> is useful for rational design of SCF extraction and related processes. Recently, thermodynamics has made considerable steps towards describing complex systems (gases with polar compounds) at high pressures using the so-called Equation of State/Excess Gibbs Free Energy (EoS/G(E)) models. The success of these models is so far restricted to Vapor-Liquid Equilibria (VLE) for which they have been primarily developed and tested. In this work we evaluate such a predictive model, the LCVM EoS, for solid-gas equilibria (SGE) including systems with <b>co-solvents.</b> LCVM is chosen due to its success for VLE of asymmetric systems such as CO 2 with heavy alkanes and alcohols. Successful predictions are obtained for several solids as well as for some systems with <b>co-solvents,</b> but the results are less satisfactory for complex, multifunctional solids. A discussion of several factors, which affect modeling of SGE with cubic EoS, is included. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|Nanosuspension {{has been}} widely used for drug {{delivery}} [12 – 16]. There are three key advantages of using nanosuspension formulations instead of solution formulations for pulmonary aerosol delivery. First, unlike solution formulations, nanosuspension formulations can be prepared without using large amount of organic <b>co-solvents,</b> thereby reducing the in vivo interference and potential toxicological effects caused by the <b>co-solvents.</b> Second, contrary to solution formations, the concentration of nanosuspension is not limited by solubility in the vehicle, thus, a wider dose range can be achieved. Finally, nanosuspension formulations provide superior content uniformity which results in greater confidence of delivery and reproducibility. Moreover, this mode of delivery can result in penetration of deep lung and smaller airways, leading to a more even drug distribution and resulting in a more accurate modeling of the drug distribution and efficacy.|$|R
50|$|SFC with CO2 {{utilizes}} {{carbon dioxide}} pumps that {{require that the}} incoming CO2 and pump heads be kept cold {{in order to maintain}} the carbon dioxide at a temperature and pressure that keeps it in a liquid state where it can be effectively metered at some specified flow rate. The CO2 subsequently becomes supercritical post the injector and in the column oven when the temperature and pressure it is subjected to are raised above the critical point of the liquid and the supercritical state is achieved. SFC as a chromatographic process has been likened to a process having the combined properties of the power of a liquid to dissolve a matrix, with the chromatographic interactions and kinetics of a gas. The result is that you can get a lot of mass on column per injection, and still maintain a high chromatographic efficiency. Typically, gradient elution is employed in analytical SFC using a polar <b>co-solvent</b> such as methanol, possibly with a weak acid or base at low concentrations ~1%. The effective plate counts per analysis can be observed to exceed 500K plates per metre routinely with 5 um material. The operator uses software to set mobile phase flow rate, <b>co-solvent</b> composition, system back pressure and column oven temperature which must exceed 40 °C for supercritical conditions to be achieved with CO2. In addition, SFC provides an additional control parameter - pressure - by using an automated back pressure regulator. From an operational standpoint, SFC is as simple and robust as HPLC but fraction collection is more convenient because the primary mobile phase evaporates leaving only the analyte and a small volume of polar <b>co-solvent.</b> If the outlet CO2 is captured, it can be recompressed and recycled, allowing for >90% reuse of CO2.|$|E
