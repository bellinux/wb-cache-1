Voluminous consumption of heroin and cocaine resulted in a further involuntary committal for Spence. As described by Peter Lewis, [...] "Skippy was just hanging around. He hadn't been all there for years, because he'd been into heroin all that time. In fact he actually ODed once and they had him in the morgue in San Jose with a tag on his toe. All of a sudden he got up and asked for a glass of water. Now he was snortin' big clumps of coke, and nothing would happen to him. We couldn't have him around because he'd be pacing the room, describing axe murders. So we got him a little place of his own. He had a little white rat named Oswald that would snort coke too. He'd never washed his dishes, and he'd try to get these little grammar school girls to go into the house with him. He was real bad. One of the parents finally <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>cops,</b> and they took him to the County Mental Health Hospital in Santa Cruz. Where they immediately lost him, and he turned up days later in the women's ward." ...|$|E
50|$|As {{he tries}} to access an ATM to {{retrieve}} his last twenty bucks, Jason “JINX” Taylor runs into a snag - the transaction fee will overdraw him, and he cannot get his {{money out of the}} bank. Jinx fumes about this and other hidden charges which complicate his life…as we realize that he is locked in a bank vault…with the beautiful but tied-up Jessica, her apparently a hostage. But, as Jinx rails against corporations and how they stack the deck, we realize that the situation is very different from what it appears: in fact, it is Jessica, not Jinx, who is robbing the bank. She is aligned with Simon, who leads an armed team inside the branch. However, Jinx’s entry into the scenario upsets the heist, leading him and Jessica to be inadvertently locked inside the vault. In addition, Jinx has <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>cops,</b> who, led by Officer De Gepse, have surrounded the bank. Jinx makes contact with Simon by cell phone, and the situation becomes clearer, as he realizes Jessica has access to a special inside-the-vault computer and its codes…she and only she can open the vault door. Simon becomes increasingly upset when he is unable to strong-talk Jinx into getting the vault open (so the robbers can clear out the safe deposit boxes). And De Gepse is equally frustrated by the standoff, particularly when it is Jinx, not he, who seems to gain control over the situation.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to {{the hard}} work of The Wild Club soundman- San Antonio's infamous Hollis- PuroSlam landed on its feet once again and found a new home on the St. Mary Strip, the same strip where MTV filmed its Halloween Special in the early nineties. Their new home was El Toro, an all ages music venue that saw PuroSlam drawing its biggest crowds yet. The out-of-control berating of the Wild Club disappeared, {{replaced}} by a finely tuned heckling that raised the act of verbal dissent to an art form. For months straight, over 100 people came out weekly to watch as many as 22 poets a night compete until as late as 1:30 in the morning. The attendance peak was reached in March 2001 when DJ Jester, The Filipino Fist, held his first CD release party during the slam, cramming 167 people into the smoke filled venue. Again, the owner was not happy with this bristling business and weeks later, she threatened to kick PuroSlam out onto the streets, demanding that they give her a cut of the two dollar entrance fee. When PuroSlam's organizers refused, reminding her that she was doing better bar business on Tuesdays than she was on the weekend, she flexed her muscles and left PuroSlam homeless once again. When co-slammasters Shaggy and Phil West stayed outside to inform slam fans that PuroSlam was moving once again, the El Toro owner <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> and threatened to have him arrested for loitering.|$|E

When a raid on a drug shipment went sour, a shootout between the cops and the mob ensued. One of the cops was shot. Faith later named Zander as the shooter. Desperate, Zander went on the run. Mac didn't realize Maxie was hiding Zander in her room. Maxie managed to get Zander to {{the basement of the}} PC Hotel and promised to get the cash he needed to flee the country. However, Nikolas found Zander first, knocked him out, and <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> to come arrest him. Mac went to arrest Zander with another officer. Unaware a fire had broken out in the electrical room where Zander was hiding, Mac opened the door. He was caught in a back draft and suffered severe burns. When Maxie found out what had happened to Mac, she went to his bedside to be with him and confessed she had been hiding Zander. When Georgie was finally rescued from the fire and arrived at the hospital, Maxie tearfully informed her of Mac's condition. Dillon supported Georgie as she went to see a badly burned Mac. The sisters continued to worry as Mac's condition seemed to worsen. Tracy Quartermaine kept lurking around, spouting false sympathies in the hopes the girls wouldn't hold the Quartermaines, who owned the hotel, responsible for Mac's condition. Georgie finally told Tracy off.|$|E
40|$|Graph searching {{problems}} {{are described as}} games played on graphs, between a set of searchers and a fugitive. Variants of the game restrict the abilities of the searchers and the fugitive and the corresponding search number (the least number of searchers that have a winning strategy) is related to several well-known parameters in graph theory. One popular variant is <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cops</b> and Robber game, where the searchers (cops) and the fugitive (robber) move in rounds, and in each round they move to an adjacent vertex. This game, defined in late 1970 ’s, has been studied intensively. The most famous open problem is Meyniel’s conjecture, which states that the cop number (the minimum number of cops that can always capture the robber) of a connected graph on n vertices is O(n). We consider {{a version of the}} Cops and Robber game, where the robber is faster than the cops, but is not allowed to jump over the cops. This version was first studied in 2008. We show that when the robber has speed s, the cop number of a connected n-vertex graph can be as large as Ω(ns/s+ 1). This improves the Ω(n s− 3 s− 2) lower bound of Frieze, Krivelevich, and Loh (Variations on Cops and Robbers, J. Graph Theory, to appear). We also conjecture a general upper bound O(ns/s+ 1) for the cop number, generalizing Meyniel’s conjecture. Then we focus on the version where the robber is infinitely fast, but is again not allowed to jump over the cops. We give a mathematical characterization for graphs with cop number one. For a graph with treewidth tw and maximum degree ∆, we prove the cop number is between tw+ 1 ∆+ 1 and tw + 1. Using this we show that the cop number of th...|$|E
