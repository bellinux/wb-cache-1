For much of the previous period, the country had operated a <b>currency</b> <b>board,</b> in which a body known as the caja de conversi√≥n was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold. The devaluation of the peso increased the competitiveness of its exports and protected domestic production. Argentina saw {{the value of its}} exports drop from $1,537 million in 1929 to $561 million in 1932, but this was by no means the most severe downturn in the region.|$|E

We study members of multilateral currency unions, dollarized countries that officially use the money of another country, and countries using <b>currency</b> <b>boards.</b> We find that belonging to an international common currency area is not associated with fiscal discipline; if anything, spending and taxes are higher inside currency unions. This effect is especially pronounced for dollarized countries that unilaterally adopt the currency of another country. <b>Currency</b> <b>boards</b> are associated with fiscal restraint.

40|$|From {{the point}} of view of the rapid {{extending}} globalization the national money systems and their interaction rise exceptionally significant questions.

The study investigates the general impact of the monetary sovereignty on the economic development. The accent is focused upon clarification of the monetary sovereignty, courses that urge nations toward monetary sovereignty or to reject it. The study also examines the economic development of nations under different currency systems: monetary sovereignty with powerful Central bank, <b>currency</b> <b>boards</b> and official <b>currency</b> substitution. ...|$|R
40|$|Since Krugman 1979, we {{know that}} the fixed {{exchange}} rate regimes have a propensity to fail because governments are unable to commit simple monetary rule in order to avoid divergence between base money supply and reserve variations.

We test, in a co-integration model adapted for panel data, the efficiency of the CB rule to run the monetary policy. We conclude that in some situations, as Argentina bi-monetarism, the monetary policy could become inoperative.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this paper is to discuss the {{historical}} contexts for the adoption of <b>currency</b> <b>boards</b> and dollarized regimes. We argue that these extreme monetary arrangements imply a loss of monetary sovereignty and are not viable without a strong integration with the anchor/official currency-issuing country. Historical examples show that <b>currency</b> <b>boards</b> using the sterling as reserve currency were systematically associated with strengthened ‚Äì indeed exclusive-commercial, financial and eventually political connections with Great Britain. The difference between older and more recent motivations is emphasized. Current CBAs/dollarization regimes disregard the necessity of a strong integration to the currency-issuing country.
