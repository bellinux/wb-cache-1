5|$|In 1986, {{redevelopment}} began {{over most}} of the area above the platforms. The new buildings were named Embankment Place, a postmodern office and shopping complex designed by Terry Farrell and Partners. This development led to the replacement of almost the whole of the 1906 roof. The rear two spans of this structure – immediately adjacent to the existing <b>concourse</b> <b>roof</b> – were retained as part of an enlarged waiting area. In addition the original retaining side walls of the station which once supported it remain in near complete condition. The works were completed in November 1990. Most of the Embankment Place complex is office space, with a selection of restaurants on the ground floor.|$|E
25|$|Intended {{to have a}} {{capacity}} of around 80,000, Football Park was originally standing room only in the outer (along with the usual crush barriers) with bench seating in the main grandstand and ended up with {{a capacity}} of approximately 62,000. Bench seating was gradually added to the stadium's bowl section, and the <b>concourse</b> <b>roof</b> was finished in 1982, by which time the grounds capacity had settled to around 55,000. The new roof gave the outer of the ground a limited number of under cover seats, as well as opening up more space for advertising boards. Television screens showing the games in progress at the ground are also in place under the <b>concourse</b> <b>roof,</b> {{as well as in the}} members area.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of September 29, 2016, an NJ Transit train crashed through a bumper block and into the {{concourse}} of the station, killing one person and injuring more than 110 people. Tracks 10 through 17 were reopened on October 10, 2016, with most remaining tracks reopened a week later. The pedestrian concourse reopened on May 14, 2017. Track 6 is set to be reopened for service in June 2017. However, Track 5 remains closed for repairs, and the permanent repairs to the <b>concourse</b> <b>roof</b> and supports are ongoing, expected to last until mid 2019.|$|E
50|$|Full {{planning}} permission was granted on 7 October 1992, {{for the construction}} of the main building, <b>concourse</b> and overall <b>roof</b> at Leicester North station., however after it was discovered that a high-pressure water main ran through the site the plans were dropped.|$|R
5000|$|A few Westvale houses predate {{suburban}} development. The Parsons farmhouse {{was replaced}} by development {{at the end of}} the 20th century. West Genesee Street has a few late 19th century residences. Early 20th century streets show houses in styles of the period, especially the 1920s and 1930s. After World War II, development was rapid, and most houses of Westvale now date from the later twentieth century. Westvale Plaza, one of the earliest suburban [...] "malls" [...] of the region, appeared in the Avery Tract shortly after World War II. It is extant as a [...] "strip mall," [...] while Fairmount Fair, immediately beyond Westvale to the west, came later. Its interior pedestrian <b>concourse</b> was <b>roofed</b> over about 1967, making it the first indoor, climate-controlled shopping mall in Central New York.|$|R
50|$|The present {{concourse}} and {{the main}} platforms date from the 1912 expansion of the station which included Bell's wrought iron canopies over the lengthy platforms 5 and 6. A new <b>roofed</b> <b>concourse</b> was built and the new station entrance included the original canopy from the old entrance. After the First World War, excursion platforms were added {{to cope with the}} many special trains. On summer Saturdays the timetable would include through trains to Leeds, London, the Midlands and Derbyshire. The inter-war period saw the greatest extent of the station complete with engine shed and two turntables with extensive sidings. The fine compact Station Buffet was built at this time.|$|R

50|$|The {{plans were}} {{extensively}} modified by Railway Commissioners in mid-construction in 1904. The changes included replacing the proposed train shed with individual platform roofs {{and it was}} decided not to include a <b>concourse</b> <b>roof.</b> To increase office space a fourth storey {{was added to the}} main building, which resulted in the arches above each entrance on Flinders Street being lowered, decreasing their dominance.|$|E
5|$|Expansion to {{the north}} end that cost $2million and added 1,249 seats was {{completed}} {{for the start of}} the 2010 MLS Season. A$120million renovation to the stadium was officially announced September 23, 2014. It includes a second tier of seating that would add 8,400 seats, raising the capacity of the stadium to 30,991. New suites, washrooms, <b>concourse</b> and a <b>roof</b> would also be added. Construction began in September 2014 and would be divided into two phases, with the completion of the project set for May 2016. The expansion would accommodate a Canadian football field with artificial turf end-zones when the Toronto Argonauts move to BMO Field in 2016, along with hosting the Grey Cup that year.|$|R
500|$|The new {{station was}} opened in stages. It was {{partially}} ready in 1909, {{with the main}} booking hall opening on 11 June 1911. A vehicular roadway to the station opened on 18 December 1911. The connection to Waterloo Junction was removed in March that year, but a siding remained until 3 May 1925. The bridge remained in place and {{was used as a}} walkway between the two stations. Construction of the main station continued sporadically throughout World War I, and the new station finally opened in 1922, with 21 platforms and a [...] long <b>concourse.</b> The <b>roof</b> and platforms were initially designed by J. W. Jacomb-Hood, who travelled to the US to look at station designs for inspiration. Following Jacomb-Hood's death in 1914, work was taken over by Alfred Weeks Szlumper. It was built in an Imperial Baroque style out of Portland stone. James Robb Scott designed the office range. The new station included a large stained glass window depicting the L's company crest over the main road entrance, surrounded by a frieze listing the counties served by the railway (the latter still survives today). These features were retained in the design, despite the fact that, by the time the station opened, the 1921 Railway Act had been passed, which spelt the end of the L as an independent concern.|$|R

5000|$|In 1905, {{work began}} on the station {{building}} itself, starting at the west end and progressing towards the main dome. Ballarat builder Peter Rodger was awarded the £93,000 contract. The station was originally to have been faced in stone, but this was considered too costly, and red brick with cement render details {{was used for the}} main building instead. Grey granite from Harcourt was used for many details on the Flinders street side at ground level [...] "in view of the importance of this great public work". The southern facade of the main building above ground level was constructed of lightweight timber frame clad with zinc sheets scored into large blocks, and painted red, giving the appearance of large bricks. This was done in order to turn what would have been open access balconies inside the train shed into corridors.Work on the dome started in 1906. The structure required heavy foundations as it extended over railway tracks. In May 1908 work was progressing slower than expected, with the expected completion date of April 1909 slipping. Rodger's contract was terminated in August 1908. A Royal Commission was appointed in May 1910, finding that Rodger could be held accountable for the slow progress in 1908, but he should be compensated for the difficulties before then. The Way and Works Branch of the Victorian Railways took over the project, the station being essentially finished by mid-1909. The verandah along Flinders Street and the <b>concourse</b> <b>roof</b> and verandah along Swanston Street were not completed until after the official opening in 1910.|$|E
