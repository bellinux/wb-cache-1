40|$|Purpose – New product <b>concept</b> <b>screening,</b> i. e., {{selecting}} a few viable innovative concepts from numerous candidates, involves high stakes and is complicated and resource intensive. Over the years, {{there has been}} heated debate about the relative merit of monadic (sequential) tests vs that of preference-based paired comparisons. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – This study proposes the Generalizability Theory as a framework to assess and compare the performance of traditional monadic test with the Adaptive <b>Concept</b> <b>Screening</b> (ACS) {{in terms of their}} testing results and psychometric quality. Findings – Using 50 yogurt concepts and two independent groups of respondents, the results indicate that ACS requires a significant smaller sample of respondents to achieve a necessary minimum G coefficient for decision making. Moreover, ACS offers a more discriminating and reliable solution for early stage <b>concept</b> <b>screening</b> as manifested by a higher G coefficient and greater percentage of variance due to the selected concepts given the same sampling design. Practical implications – The results lend strong support to ACS as a more cost-effective method for screening new product concepts and the Generalizability Theory as a systematic framework for assessing concept testing methods. Originality/value – This study adopts the Generalizability Theory framework to assess the validity of new product <b>concept</b> <b>screening</b> method...|$|E

The voltage induced {{driving force}} on a {{migrating}} atom in a metallic system {{is discussed in}} {{the perspective of the}} Hellmann-Feynman force <b>concept,</b> local <b>screening</b> <b>concepts</b> and the linear-response approach.

The physics involved is completely represented in ab initio local density treatments of dilute alloys and the implementation does not require additional precautions about screening, being typical for jellium treatments. The linear-response approach is shown to be a reliable guide in deciding about the two contributions to the driving force, the direct force and the wind force.

40|$|Metrics for product concept {{evaluation}} and screening {{is a relatively}} unstudied topic of product development. Having a clearly documented set of metrics for <b>concept</b> <b>screening</b> decisions {{is a prerequisite for}} an educated and traceable decision making process. Measuring product concepts and comparing the results of pervious products and their success rates to the metrics documented for their screening provides a basis on which to improve the efficiency of product development work. In this study a list of product <b>concept</b> <b>screening</b> metrics, or issues if you please, is put forth. This list is priorized according to the importance of the metrics. The relative importance of the metrics is determined for a number of different groups, including academia and industry, along with geographical samples from Finland and the USA. Furthermore a brief study on published product concepts is presented to show that some of these metrics are indeed researched by companies and to determine the information that companies seek to obtain by publishing product concepts.

40|$|When the {{decision}} to study {{the development of an}} offshore field is taken, the concept phase of an offshore project development starts. The concept phase consists of the <b>concept</b> <b>screening,</b> conceptual engineering and concept selection stages. While <b>concept</b> <b>screening</b> and conceptual engineering stages represent a specific sequence of engineering calculations to determine technical feasibility and all aspects of each possible development concept for an offshore field, the concept selection stage represents a decision making process where a lot of factors should be considered in order to identify the optimal concept which satisfies all technical, economic and safety requirements along others. According to recent tendency in oil and gas industry, the Arctic offshore area has a great potential for future field developments. However high ecological risks, challenging environment for operation and construction as well as requirements for huge money investments impose accessorial liability on decisions taken in the early phases of the project and especially in the selection of the optimal development concept. The purpose of the thesis is concretization of the Concept selection process for Arctic offshore field development. Identification of the possible criteria influencing the definition of the optimal development concept is carried out. Prioritizing of each criterion according to its importance in the Concept selection process is then performed. Attention is given to the main Arctic specifics and challenges that could affect the field development concept. On the basis of this analysis the <b>concept</b> <b>screening</b> and the conceptual engineering steps for Arctic projects are discussed. The main driving factors for qualifying the development concept are defined. Their effects on the development concept in the Arctic are then considered. In the second part the Concept selection process for the Arctic offshore field development is considered. Criteria influencing the concept selection process were identified. Criteria identification is performed on the basis of wide literature survey which includes industry standards, scientific articles and English and Russian engineering books about offshore field development. Evaluation of the criteria’s importance is carried out by the help of experts’ judgment method. A questionnaire for criteria evaluation was prepared and a group of relevant people from the industry, who deals with the Arctic offshore field development, weighted each criterion according to their importance in the Arctic offshore concept selection process. As a result, a list of the most important criteria, representing the basis for selection of development concept for Arctic offshore fields, is prepared. The results of the work are presented {{in the form of a}} methodological tool for the Arctic offshore concept selection. The model is dedicated to the Concept Phase of the Arctic offshore project. Each stage at that phase is considered in the model. Parameters important in the screening stage are listed. Their imposed limitations on the development concept are identified. A list of criteria for comparison of possible development concepts is included in the model. Thus, the model represents a step by step approach for the implementation of the Concept Phase of an Arctic offshore project. The conclusion summarizes the acquired findings, provides reasonable recommendations for the concept selection of the Arctic offshore fields and gives the scope for the future work...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of immature concepts makes difficult decision making at upstream {{phase of a}} development project. Rework tasks in collaborative development projects dealing with immature design concepts are very frequent and are responsible of cost overruns and schedule delays. In addition, decisions taken during conceptual design stage have the most important influence on product life cycle cost. In this context, a useful practice is to develop two or more concepts in parallel and delay decision making. Even so, a first <b>screening</b> of <b>concepts</b> is usually needed because of the substantial resources and time required in development phase.
