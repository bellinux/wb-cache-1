5|$|Edward {{never again}} went on crusade {{after his return}} to England in 1274, but he {{maintained}} an intention to do so, and took the <b>cross</b> <b>again</b> in 1287. This intention guided much of his foreign policy, until at least 1291. To stage a European-wide crusade, it was essential to prevent conflict between the greater princes on the continent. A major obstacle to this was represented by {{the conflict between the}} French House of Anjou ruling southern Italy, and the kingdom of Aragon in Spain. In 1282, the citizens of Palermo rose up against Charles of Anjou and turned for help to Peter of Aragon, in what has become known as the Sicilian Vespers. In the war that followed, Charles of Anjou's son, Charles of Salerno, was taken prisoner by the Aragonese. The French began planning an attack on Aragon, raising the prospect of a large-scale European war. To Edward, it was imperative that such a war be avoided, and in Paris in 1286 he brokered a truce between France and Aragon that helped secure Charles' release. As far as the crusades were concerned, however, Edward's efforts proved ineffective. A devastating blow to his plans came in 1291, when the Mamluks captured Acre, the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land.|$|E

500|$|Various Marvel writers, {{including}} Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Millar, Ed Brubaker and incoming Amazing Spider-Man writer Dan Slott {{had a hand}} {{in developing}} the story. During the course of the story's development, Quesada claims that he and Straczynski made plans to resurrect Gwen Stacy alongside Harry Osborn in the final chapter. This plot twist was discarded after numerous Marvel editors and writers lobbied for the character to remain dead. According to Quesada, Straczynski's original script for the storyline's fourth issue involved changes to continuity going as far back as 1971. Peter would have helped Harry Osborn get into rehab for his drug addiction immediately, which would have allowed a number of rewrites. Mary Jane would have remained in a relationship with Harry, Gwen would not have been killed and ultimately Peter's marriage to Mary Jane would not have taken place. Quesada realized that these changes would have far-reaching consequences for both historical and forthcoming storylines, so he made the decision to change Straczynski's story. While Peter and Mary Jane were to have remained a couple for the purposes of back-story, they were simply not a married couple. Quesada also described [...] "One More Day" [...] as an emotional climax of sorts and resolution for the relationship between Peter Parker and Tony Stark, who had developed a father-son-like bond during the [...] "Civil War" [...] storyline. However, Quesada hinted the paths of the two characters could <b>cross</b> <b>again</b> in the future due to planned storylines for Iron Man.|$|E
2500|$|King Béla IV {{used the}} patriarchal <b>cross</b> <b>again</b> [...] – {{the reasons for}} this {{decision}} are unknown. Some historians suggest that he simply copied Béla III, his ideal, though this is only an assumption. At the time of his rule, the patriarchal cross also became the symbol of the Pozsony (Prešporok, Bratislava or Pressburg) county, although in a slightly modified form.|$|E
2500|$|Arriving {{the next}} day the Mactan then spent five days in the port as United States {{authorities}} tried to determine the best course of action and consulted with Australian authorities.

There the ship was escorted into harbor by an Australian gunboat to a welcome that included supplies and [...] "towels, chocolate, cookies, and comfort articles" [...] by the [...] Australian Red Cross and Northern Territory officials. With Darwin itself threatened instructions were given to proceed to Sydney with stops at Townsville and Brisbane. On the way to Townsville a brief fire on 15 January caused concern but was put out. The Australian Red <b>Cross</b> <b>again</b> provided assistance and the ship arrived Brisbane 24 January. There the ship and its patients were greeted by residents turned out on the river banks and hills cheering and, on tying up, by the American consul, the commander of the American base at Brisbane and other U.S. officials and learned U.S. troops had arrived there earlier.|$|E
