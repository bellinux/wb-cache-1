5|$|Later {{on in the}} Song dynasty the <b>compass</b> {{was used}} with {{maritime}} navigation. Several decades after the Wujing Zongyao was written, the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095 AD) wrote of the first truly magnetized <b>compass</b> needle in his book Dream Pool Essays (1088 AD). With a more efficient <b>compass</b> magnetized by lodestone, the thermoremanence <b>compass</b> fell out of use. The later maritime author Zhu Yu soon wrote of the magnetic needle <b>compass</b> {{as a means to}} navigate at sea, in his book Pingzhou Table Talks of 1119 AD.|$|E
5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a <b>compass.</b> A <b>compass</b> is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a <b>compass</b> can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E

5000|$|At its {{production}} facility in Haninge, Sweden, and in mainland China, Silva of Sweden AB manufactures {{a wide variety}} of portable <b>compasses</b> for recreational, hiking, scientific, and marine uses.

5|$|Over the Bering Sea, {{the three}} B-29s {{maintained}} radio contact with each other, communicating positions hourly as they navigated independently. Near the Arctic Circle, the magnetic compasses fluctuated wildly, and the fliers ignored them, relying {{instead on the}} radio <b>compass.</b> In Number 2, the radio <b>compass</b> stopped working as well, but it resumed working later in the flight.|$|E
5|$|Shen Kuo {{wrote that}} it was {{preferable}} to use the twenty-four-point rose instead of the old eight <b>compass</b> cardinal points — and the former was recorded in use for navigation shortly after Shen's death. The preference of use for the twenty-four-point-rose <b>compass</b> may have arisen from Shen's finding of a more accurate astronomical meridian, determined by his measurement between the pole star and true north; however, it could also {{have been inspired by}} geomantic beliefs and practices. The book of the author Zhu Yu, the Pingzhou Table Talks published in 1119 (written from 1111 to 1117), was the first record of use of a <b>compass</b> for seafaring navigation. However, Zhu Yu's book recounts events back to 1086, when Shen Kuo was writing the Dream Pool Essays; this meant that in Shen's time the <b>compass</b> might have already been in navigational use. In any case, Shen Kuo's writing on magnetic compasses has proved invaluable for understanding China's earliest use of the <b>compass</b> for seafaring navigation.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese of the Song dynasty were adept sailors who {{traveled}} to {{ports of call}} {{as far away as}} Fatimid Egypt. They were well equipped for their journeys abroad, in large seagoing vessels steered by stern-post rudders and guided by the directional <b>compass.</b> Even before Shen Kuo and Zhu Yu had described the mariner's magnetic needle <b>compass,</b> the earlier military treatise of the Wujing Zongyao in 1044 had also described a thermoremanence <b>compass.</b> This was a simple iron or steel needle that was heated, cooled, and placed in a bowl of water, producing the effect of weak magnetization, although its use was described only for navigation on land and not at sea.|$|E

5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to <b>compass</b> malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their <b>compass</b> was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their <b>compass,</b> which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their <b>compass,</b> which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a system of}} autonomous mobile robots that can move in the two dimensional space. These robots must gather, in finite time, at a single point in the plane, not predetermined (gathering problem).

In our previous work, we proposed an algorithm that gathers two oblivious mobile robots in finite time when the <b>compasses</b> diverge by at most 45 °.

5000|$|The Square and <b>Compasses</b> (or, more correctly, {{a square}} {{and a set}} of <b>compasses</b> joined together) is the single most {{identifiable}} symbol of Freemasonry. Both the square and <b>compasses</b> are architect's tools and are used in Masonic ritual as emblems to teach symbolic lessons. Some Lodges and rituals explain these symbols as lessons in conduct: for example, Duncan's Masonic Monitor of 1866 explains them as: [...] "The square, to square our actions; The <b>compasses,</b> to circumscribe and keep us within bounds with all mankind". However, as Freemasonry is non-dogmatic, there is no general interpretation for these symbols (or any Masonic symbol) that is used by Freemasonry as a whole.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we are {{discussing}} {{the effect of the}} use of magnetic <b>compasses</b> on the orientation of ancient Chinese architectonical complexes. As Czech researchers proposed in 2011, assuming these complexes ideally oriented by the ancient architects along north-south direction, in the case that the surveys were made by means of magnetic <b>compasses,</b> we can find the axes of the complexes deviating from the cardinal direction, according to the local magnetic declination that existed at the time the structures were built. Following this idea, here we discuss some examples of possible alignments obtained by means of magnetic <b>compasses,</b> concluding that the Chinese surveyors adopted, during the Ming dynasty, a method based on the magnetic <b>compasses.</b> The architects of the antecedent Yuan Dynasty probably used an astronomical method.
