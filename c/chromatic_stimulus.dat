The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate if this “photopic hill” could be modulated with the use of stimuli of different wavelengths. ERGs were evoked to flashes of white, blue, green and red light presented against a white background in 30 normal subjects. Each <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> produced a photopic hill.

40|$|Brightness-luminance {{relations}} have been extensively studied in literature. Originally the observer's {{task was to}} match brightness by direct comparison (DCB). In the current paper an experimental investigation of the Ware and Cowan Conversion Factor (WCCF) is presented. The observer's task was in part modified: memory brightness matching (MB) in addition to DCB. In MB the observer does not see the <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> together with the achromatic stimulus. A {{significant difference between the}} Leq/L ratios of DCB and MB was found.

The colour of the flashes {{and the size}} of the steady background on which they appeared were such that detection was more likely to be mediated by either the large-diameter, magnocellular fibres or the small-diameter, parvocellular fibres of the anterior visual pathway. The spacing of the test sites ranged from 0. 5 degrees to 4 degrees visual angle, depending on the shape and location of the scotomata. The greatest differences in sensitivity were between sites just inside and just outside the scotoma and in response to achromatic stimuli more likely to involve the magnocellular fibres. This effect may be due to the size of magnocellular fibres or to their relatively smaller numbers...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to test the {{hypothesis}} that glaucoma leads to selective deficits in parallel pathways or channels. Sweep VEPs were obtained to isolated-check stimuli that were modulated sinusoidally in either isoluminant chromatic contrast or in positive and negative luminance contrast. Response functions were obtained from 14 control subjects, 15 patients with open-angle glaucoma, and seven glaucoma suspects. For all three groups of subjects we found characteristic differences between the VEP response functions to isoluminant chromatic contrast stimuli and to luminance contrast stimuli. The isoluminant <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> conditions appeared to favor activity of the P-pathway, whereas the luminance contrast stimuli at low depths of modulation favored M-pathway activity. VEP responses for patients with OAG were significantly reduced for chromatic contrast and luminance contrast conditions, whereas VEP responses for glaucoma suspects were significantly reduced only for the 15 -Hz positive luminance contrast condition. Our results suggest that both M- and P-pathways are affected by glaucoma...|$|E

Phase II consisted of pairing the hue with a chromatically neutral stimulus of various intensities. The neutral stimuli used in Phase II appeared as shades of gray ranging between black and white. All animals confused a hue with some shade of gray. The intensity of the gray which was confused with a hue was called the point of subjective equality (PSE); no evidence of color discrimination ability was found.

The dependence on contrast of amplitude thresholds for the perception of oscillatory motion was measured. The targets were Gabor patches modulated either chromatically along the L–M isoluminant axis or in luminance. When single targets were presented, {{the slope of the}} function relating log threshold amplitude to log contrast was approximately − 0. 50 for chromatic targets and 0. 00 for luminance targets. When a reference target was present the slopes were approximately − 0. 50 for both types of target.

40|$|We studied {{changes in}} the color {{appearance}} of a <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> as it underwent simultaneous contrast with a more luminous surround. Three normal trichromats provided color-naming descriptions for a 10 [*]cd/m 2 monochromatic field while a broadband white annulus surround ranged in luminance from 0. 2 [*]cd/m 2 to 200 [*]cd/m 2. Descriptions of the chromatic field included Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White, and Black or their combinations. The naming frequencies for each color/surround were used to calculate measures of similarity among the stimuli. Multidimensional scaling analysis of these subjective similarities resulted in a four-dimensional color space with two chromatic axes, red–green and blue–yellow, and two achromatic axes, revealing separate qualities of blackness/lightness and saturation. Contrast-induced darkening of the chromatic field {{was found to be}} accompanied by shifts in both hue and saturation. Hue shifts were similar to the Bezold–Brücke shift; shifts in saturation were also quantified. A stage model is proposed to account for the relationships among blackness induction and the inherent nonlinearities in chromatic and achromatic processing...|$|E
40|$|Hypnotic {{suggestions}} {{may change}} the perceived color of objects. Given that <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> information is processed rapidly and automatically by the visual system, how can hypnotic suggestions affect perceived colors in a seemingly immediate fashion? We studied the mechanisms of such color alterations by measuring electroencephalography in two highly suggestible participants as they perceived briefly presented visual shapes under posthypnotic color alternation suggestions such as "all the squares are blue". One participant consistently reported seeing the suggested colors. Her reports correlated with enhanced evoked upper beta-band activity (22 Hz) 70 - 120 ms after stimulus {{in response to the}} shapes mentioned in the suggestion. This effect was not observed in a control condition where the participants merely tried to simulate the effects of the suggestion on behavior. The second participant neither reported color alterations nor showed the evoked beta activity, although her subjective experience and event-related potentials were changed by the suggestions. The results indicate a preconscious mechanism that first compares early visual input with a memory representation of the suggestion and consequently triggers the color alteration process in response to the objects specified by the suggestion. Conscious color experience is not purely the result of bottom-up processing but it can be modulated, at least in some individuals, by top-down factors such as hypnotic suggestions...|$|E

As a result, the functional roles of these subdivisions in humans have not been investigated physiologically. To functionally map the M and P subdivisions of human LGN, we used high-resolution fMRI at high field (7. T and 3.

These differences in preference {{have often been}} called “hue” or “color” preferences, and attributed to differences in hue, but there are alternative explanations. Spontaneous preference variations remain after stimuli are equated for adult brightness, and thus cannot be attributed to adult-like brightness differences [Teller, D.

Because the chromatic stimuli and the achromatic backgrounds of the test consist of dots that vary in lightness, the stimulus parameters can be adjusted so that animals {{are not able to}} use luminance differences to make correct discriminations.

40|$|Blood {{oxygenation}} level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals often exhibit pronounced over- or undershoot upon {{changes in}} stimulation state. Current models postulate {{that this is}} due to the delayed onset or decay of perfusion-dependent attenuating responses such as increased cerebral blood volume or oxygen consumption, which are presumed to lag behind the rapid adjustment of blood flow rate to a new steady-state level. If this view is correct, then BOLD overshoot amplitudes in a specific tissue volume should be correlated with steady-state increases in perfusion, independent of stimulus type. To test this prediction, we simultaneously recorded BOLD and relative perfusion signals in primary visual cortex while inducing graded perfusion increases with three types of visual stimulus. Two of these, a diffuse <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> with no luminance variation and a very high spatial frequency luminance grating, did not produce detectable BOLD overshoot (or undershoot) when an equal mean luminance baseline was used. Radial checkerboard stimuli, however, caused pronounced over/undershoot of both BOLD and perfusion signals even when temporal mean luminance was held constant and stimulus contrast was adjusted to produce the same steady-state blood flow increases evoked by the other stimuli. Transient amplitudes were relatively invariant in spite of large changes in steady-state response, demonstrating nonlinear BOLD and perfusion step responses in human V 1. These findings suggest that, rather than a purely tissue-specific biomechanical or metabolic phenomenon, BOLD overshoot and undershoot represent transient features in the perfusion signal whose effects may be amplified by slowly evolving blood volume changes...|$|E

Behavioral (forced-choice preferential-looking) techniques and stationary stimuli were used. In experiment 1, contrast thresholds were measured in 4 - and 6 -month-olds, using isoluminant red–green gratings with spatial frequencies ranging from 0. 27 to 1. 53 c/deg. In experiment 2, contrast thresholds were measured in 4 -month-olds, using both red–green and luminance-modulated gratings in the same low spatial frequency range. Covariance analyses of individual differences were performed. Experiment 1 revealed one dominant covariance channel for the detection of red–green gratings, with a second channel contributing to detection of the highest spatial frequencies used. Experiment 2 revealed two to three channels serving color and luminance; but surprisingly these channels were not statistically separable for luminance versus <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Thus, covariance channels for color and luminance that are independent for adults [Peterzell & Teller (2000).

40|$|An {{enduring}} practical {{problem in}} studying human visual development is to obtain enough data {{to evaluate the}} vision of individual infants. With this problem in mind, we have produced a new test of basic color vision using Munsell Hues and a method patterned after the Teller Acuity Cards (TAC). [...] In our procedure, we first evaluate an infant's sensitivity to luminance contrast. The baby is shown large gray cards (21. 5 x 56 cm) that have a 7. 5 x 12 cm gray "standard" patch of the same luminance on the left or the right side, and a gray "test" patch of different luminance on the other side. Like the TAC procedure, a "blind" observer attempts to correctly judge {{the location of the}} test patch. The procedure continues until the smallest detectable luminance increment and decrement is determined. Next, we test the infant with chromatic test patches. To eliminate brightness cues, the relative luminance of the chromatic patch and the gray background is varied systematically (Teller & Bornstein, 1987) in equiluminant steps over a wide range (about 1 log unit) centered around an adult brightness match. The step size (thus, the number of cards needed for each chromatic test) is determined by the subject's sensitivity to contrast in the first phase. [...] We used the Color/Contrast Cards to test 70 2 - and 3 month-olds with four broad-band <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimuli,</b> namely a red (dominant wavelength = 660 nm), a (580 nm) yellow, a (520 nm) green, and a (475 nm) blue. In approximately 20 minutes, 83 % of 2 -month-olds and 87. 5 % of 3 -month-olds completed the contrast phase and {{at least one of the}} four <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimuli,</b> and of these, 37 % of 2 -month-olds and 34 % of 3 -month-olds completed all four <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Both groups of infants were significantly better at detecting luminance decrements than increments. 3 -month-olds discriminated all four <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> from gray. In contrast, 2 -month-olds discriminated the red and blue from gray but failed to discriminate the yellow and green from gray at relative luminances close to the adult brightness match. Reasons for 2 -month-olds' "failures" are discussed in detail. [...] In general, the procedure was successful. Over a relatively short period, we could test an infant's sensitivity to luminance contrast, her/his chromatic-achromatic discriminations, and the relative luminances at which the infant "fails" to make these discriminations. In future, the Color/Contrast Cards should prove to be clinically useful for screening younger infants and handicapped children, as well as experimentally useful in providing information about the development of color vision and its underlying mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|NoPURPOSE. This study {{examined}} the influence of stimulus chromaticity on simple reaction times (RTs) to determine the stage of chromatic processing that is most influential in their generation. METHODS. Simple RTs were measured {{in response to the}} cosinusoidally ramped onset of small, equiluminant, colored Gaussian spots. The chromaticity of these stimuli was varied, to modulate along a series of vectors in color space that included red-green (L-M) and blue-yellow (S-[L+M]) opponent axes. RESULTS. RTs are highly sensitive to small departures from subjective equiluminance. They are also dependent on stimulus chromaticity. The longest RTs are generated in response to equiluminant stimuli that isolate S-cone activity, whereas the shortest are generated by stimuli that modulate the L-M opponent axis. However, temporal processing differences are highly dependent on how the <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> are scaled in relation to one another. The differences are reduced when scaling is based on detection threshold. The relationship between chromatic contrast and RT can be described by the modified Piéron equation RT = RT 0 + k · C- 1. CONCLUSIONS. Simple RTs generated in this study conform to the idea that they are largely determined by cone-opponency mechanisms. The use of cone contrast as a metric for scaling <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> exaggerates differences between the temporal responsiveness of L-M and S-(L+M) opponency mechanisms...|$|R

However, the role of pupillary responses to <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> is not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate how color and luminance signals contribute to the pupillary control mechanism. Methods: We measured pupillary iso-response contours in M-and L-cone contrast space. The iso-response contours in cone-contrast space have been determined to examine what mechanisms contribute to the pupillary pathway. The shapes of the iso-response contour change when different mechanisms determine the response. Results: It was shown that for all subjects, the pupillary iso-response contours form an ellipse with positive slope in cone-contrast space, indicating that the sensitivities to the <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> are higher than those for the luminance stimuli. The pupil responds maximally to a grating that has a stronger L-cone modulation than the red-green isoluminant grating. Conclusions: The sensitivity of the chromatic pathway, in terms of pupillary response, is three times larger than that of the luminance pathway, a property that might have utility in clinical applications.

In order to produce stimuli in which luminance cues had been eliminated with an aim to eliciting a chromatic response, preliminary studies of isoluminance determination in adults and infants were undertaken using behavioural and electrophysiological techniques. The results showed close similarity between the isoluminant ratio for adults and infants and all values were close to photometric isoluminance. Pattern reversal VEPs were recorded to stimuli of a range of red/green luminance ratios and an achromatic checkerboard. No transient VEP could be elicited with an isoluminant chromatic pattern reversal stimulus from any infant less than 7 weeks post term and similarly, all infants more than 7 weeks post term showed clear chromatic VEPs. The chromatic response first appeared at that age as a major positive component (P 1) of long latency. This was delayed and reduced in comparison to the achromatic response. As the infant grew older, the latency of the P 1 component decreased with the appearance of N 1 and N by the 10 th week post term. This finding was consistent throughout all infants assessed. In a behavioural study, no infant less than 7 weeks post term demonstrated clear discrimination of the <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimulus,</b> while those infants older than 7 weeks could do so. These findings are reviewed with respect to current neural models of visual development...|$|E
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is {{concerned}} with examining the retinal and cortical contributions to human trichromatic colour vision. Chromatic processing at the cortex level was examined using visual evoked potentials (VEPs). These responses were elicited by chromatic spot stimuli, which were manipulated in order to selectively activate the chromatic processing system. Chromatic processing at the retinal level was examined using the electroretinograms (ERGs) for which cone isolating stimuli {{were used to assess}} the nature of L and M cone inputs to cone-opponent mechanisms. The results from the VEP experiments suggest VEP morphology is dependent upon 1) chromatic and or luminance contrast content of the stimulus, 2) stimulus size, and 3) extent to which the <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> activates either the L/M or S/(L+M) opponent mechanism. The experiments indicate that chromatic stimulation is indexed by large N 1 component and small offset responses. Optimal stimulus size for chromatic isolation is 2 - 4 ° along L/M axes and 6 ° along S/(L+M) axis. From the ERG experiments, It has been shown that the low (12 Hz) and high (30 Hz) temporal frequency flickering stimuli can isolate the chromatic and luminance processing mechanisms in the retina. For low temporal frequency ERGs, the L:M ratio was close to unity and L/M phase difference was close to 180 °. For high temporal frequency ERGs, the L:M ratio was more than unity and L/M phase difference was close to 90 °. In addition to this, the variation in L:M ratio across the retinal eccentricity was also examined. These results suggest, for the chromatic processing, L:M ratio is close to unity independent of retinal eccentricity and individuals. For the luminance processing, L:M ratio is more than unity and depends upon the region of the retina being stimulated. These findings indicate the maintenance of cone selective input for the chromatic processing across the human retina. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recorded}} steady-state PERGs from five macaque monkeys {{in response to}} red-green plaid patterns reversed sinusoidally in contrast. The patterns had either a pure luminance contrast (red-black, green-black, yellow-black), pure red-green color contrast, or a variable amount of luminance and color contrast. By varying the relative luminance of the red-to-total luminance (color ratio) of red-green patterns, a value could be obtained at which the PERG amplitude was either minimum or locally maximum, and the phase was most lagged. This value was {{very similar to that}} producing equiluminance in human observers, and was considered to be equiluminance for the monkey. The phase of the PERG to <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> was systematically lagged compared with that of luminance stimuli, by an amount corresponding to about 10 - 20 ms under our experimental conditions. The variation of phase with temporal frequency suggested an apparent latency of about 80 ms for color contrast compared with 63 ms for luminance. These estimates were confirmed with separate measurements of transient PERGs to abrupt contrast reversal. As a function of temporal frequency, the chromatic PERG function was clearly low-pass with a cutoff around 15 Hz, whereas that to luminance was double-peaked and extended to higher temporal frequencies, around 30 Hz. For both luminance and chromatic stimuli, the amplitude of PERGs increases with increasing stimulus contrast. By summing vectorially the luminance and chromatic responses of appropriate contrasts, we were able to predict with accuracy the response as a function of color ratio. In two monkeys, the optic chiasm was sectioned sagittally causing total degeneration of ganglion cells in the nasal retina, without affecting the temporal retina (verified by histology). In these animals, there was a strong response to both luminance and chromatic patterns in the temporal retinae, but none to either type of pattern in the nasal retinae, suggesting that the PERG to both luminance and chromatic stimuli arises from the inner-retinal layers. Electrophysiological studies suggest that the PERG to chromatic stimuli is probably associated with the activity of P-cells. P-cells may also make a major contribution to the PERG of luminance stimuli, although M-cells may also participate. The above findings on normal monkeys all agree with those reported in the accompanying paper for humans (Morrone et al., 1994), so similar conclusions can probably be extended to human PERG...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} receptive-field {{structure}} of mechanisms operating in human color vision, by recording visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to multiharmonic gratings modulated either in luminance or color (red-green). Varying the Fourier {{phase of the}} harmonics from 0 deg to 90 deg produced a family of stimulus profiles that varied from lines to edges. The stimuli were contrast reversed to elicit steady-state VEPS, and also randomly jittered (at a higher temporal frequency than the contrast reversal) {{to ensure that the}} evoked response resulted from the polarity reversal, rather than from local variation of luminance or color. Reliable VEPs were recorded from both luminance and <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> at all phases, suggesting that the mechanisms sensitive to chromatic contrast and those sensitive to luminance contrast have both symmetric and asymmetric receptive fields. Contrast thresholds estimated by extrapolation of the contrast response curves were very similar to psychophysical thresholds for phase discrimination, suggesting that the VEP response is generated by mechanisms mediating phase discrimination. The results support the idea that human color mechanisms have receptive fields with a variety of spatial symmetries (including odd- and even-symmetric fields) and that these mechanisms may contribute to phase discrimination of <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> in a similar way to what has been suggested for luminance vision...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIncreasing {{anatomical}} {{evidence indicates}} that large retinal ganglion cells (M-cells) are preferentially damaged in primary open angle glaucoma (OAG), while the smaller ganglion cells (P-cells) are relatively spared. In 13 patients with defined OAG and modest visual field defects, we evaluated the responses to stimuli {{that are expected to}} involve primarily the function of the P-pathway and compared them with those of control subjects. The psychophysical contrast sensitivity (CS), the PERG and VEPs were measured for red-green gratings of pure chromatic contrast, as well as yellow-black gratings of pure luminance contrast. As compared with controls, OAG patients had reduced CS for both luminance and <b>chromatic</b> contrast <b>stimuli</b> by about 6 dB. PERGs and VEPs to luminance stimuli were little affected, whereas those to <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> were both reduced in amplitude and delayed. These results indicate that visual dysfunction in glaucoma is not selective for the M-pathway, and that responses to equiluminant colour-contrast stimuli may be of diagnostic value...|$|R
40|$|People can use {{feedback}} to make online corrections to movements {{but only if}} there is sufficient time to integrate the new information and make the correction. A key variable in this process is therefore {{the speed at which}} the new information about the target location is coded. Conduction velocities for chromatic signals are lower than for achromatic signals so it may take longer to correct reaches to <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> In addition to this delay, the sensorimotor system may prefer achromatic information over the chromatic information as delayed information may be less valuable when movements are made under time pressure. A down-weighting of chromatic information may result in additional latencies for chromatically directed reaches. In our study, participants made online corrections to reaches to achromatic, (L–M) -cone, and S-cone <b>stimuli.</b> Our <b>chromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> were carefully adjusted to minimize stimulation of achromatic pathways, and we equated stimuli both in terms of detection thresholds and also by their estimated neural responses. Similar stimuli were used throughout the subjective adjustments and final reaching experiment. Using this paradigm, we found that responses to achromatic stimuli were only slightly faster than responses to (L–M) -cone and S-cone stimuli. We conclude that the sensorimotor system treats chromatic and achromatic information similarly and that the delayed chromatic responses primarily reflect early conduction delays.
