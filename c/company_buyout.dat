50|$|Despite having {{employed}} designer Peter Stevens {{to revamp}} the range and design two new concept cars, by 1985 the British investors recognised that they lacked the required capital {{to invest in the}} required new model development to production, and sought to find a major motor manufacturing buyer. In January 1986, Wickins oversaw the majority sale of the Group Lotus companies and 100% of North American-based LPCI to General Motors, with engineer Bob Eaton a big Lotus car fan. After four months of controlling but co-owning Group Lotus with Toyota, the Japanese company sold out to GM. By October 1986, GM had acquired a 91% stake in Group Lotus for £22.7 million, which allowed them to legally force the <b>company</b> <b>buyout.</b>|$|E
5000|$|WHVE {{then changed}} its calls to WWNZ-FM, and began {{simulcasting}} WWNZ's talk format, {{though it would}} air a few separate shows. Paxson sold WWNZ-FM to Press Broadcasting, which also owned WKCF, in 1993. In May of that year, Press Broadcasting initiated the WTKS calls and the [...] "Real Radio" [...] format, which was talk shows during the week (including Howard Stern for a few years) and alternative rock on the weekend. Real Radio was created by Sabo Media CEO Walter Sabo for Press Broadcasting. The station was sold back to Paxson in 1996 and then came {{under the umbrella of}} Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) in 1997.

40|$|In May 1976, with merely 120, 000 {{and a few}} metal chairs {{left behind}} from a prior tenant, Kolberg Kravis Roberts 2 ̆ 6 Co. (KKR) opened its doors. Though few people outside Wall Street circles knew of this {{start-up}} company, by the 1980 s its reputation as a takeover machine brought it notoriety. One {{can only imagine what}} went on behind closed doors, but whatever happened, it worked. By 1989, KKR had become the largest client of accounting giant Deloitte 2 ̆ 6 Touche, with General Motors following as a close second. The “Age of Leverage” peaked in 1990 when KKR took over RJR Nabisco. Until 2006, this takeover was the largest in history and is still considered one of the largest ever. The deal almost ruined KKR, yet KKR managed to acquire many other companies in the ensuing years. In late February 2007, KKR and other private equity firms announced another record-breaking deal. An investor group led by KKR and Texas Pacific Group (TPG) purchased TXU Corporation, a Texas-based energy company, for an unprecedented 45 billion. GS Capital Partners, Lehman Brothers, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley became equity partners at closing. An official statement explained that the new owners planned to have stronger environmental and climate stewardship policies, to invest in alternative energy, and to focus on the electric consumer market by delivering both price cuts and protection. Although a deal of this volume may seem extraordinary, it {{is only one of the}} many mega-deals in the realm of private equity, which has become a vital engine for investment in our economy. Generally, private equity is any equity investment that is not freely tradable on public stock markets. A trend contributing to the success of private equity is a strategy known as “clubbing. ” Clubbing occurs when at least two buyout firms join forces to purchase a <b>company.</b> <b>Buyout</b> firms cite many reasons for clubbing, such as spreading the risk of a single deal or amassing sufficient capital to acquire a huge corporate target. But clubbing can carry negative consequences as well, especially if companies use the practice to inhibit competition. This concern apparently worried the Department of Justice (DOJ), which in October 2006 launched an inquiry into the potentially anticompetitive behavior of private equity firms—an inquiry that could unearth antitrust violations. The DOJ is examining the possibility of collusion among private equity firms and is trying to discover attempts by clubs to reduce purchase prices. The inquiry started with a two-page letter sent to several of the largest private equity firms seeking voluntary, general information about club deals since January 2003. Although seemingly straightforward, the inquiry presents many complex issues that cannot be easily resolved. Irrespective of the outcome, the private equity industry is paying attention. Private equity will likely need to change if it wishes to continue assembling mega-deals like the TXU deal. This Note addresses the antitrust issues that clubbing raises and argues that the antitrust laws should not restrict clubbing—absent some egregious conduct—and that courts should apply rule of reason analysis rather than per se rules to these sorts of antitrust claims. Part II provides a general background of antitrust law and the various standards that courts apply to private equity clubs. Part III explains private equity and fleshes out what a club deal is and how it works. Part IV discusses antitrust law within the context of joint ventures and sets out the varying standards that could apply to private equity clubs. Part V applies the antitrust analysis to private equity clubbing. Finally, Part VI concludes by suggesting ways to deal with antitrust problems and by examining some of the underlying issues...|$|E

5000|$|The AQM-37's {{engine is}} built by Rocketdyne, though in some sources it is {{credited}} to Harley Davidson, the motorcycle manufacturer, {{which appears to}} be due to a sequence of <b>company</b> <b>buyouts.</b> The engine uses [...] "storable" [...] liquid propellants, in contrast to cryogenic propellants like liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen that have to be loaded up just before launch lest they evaporate away. The problem is that the storable propellants in common use are corrosive, highly toxic, and [...] "hypergolic", meaning that the propellants spontaneously ignite when mixed together.

50|$|The Anschutz Entertainment Group {{first tried}} to build an arena in Las Vegas in {{association}} with Harrah's Entertainment. In 2007, the joint venture announced they would build a 20,000 seat stadium behind the Bally's and Paris casino-hotels. Caesars Entertainment, Inc. had previously envisioned using the location to build a baseball park, but the <b>company's</b> <b>buyout</b> by Harrah's cancelled the plans. Through the following year, Harrah's became uncertain on continuing with the project, not knowing if AEG would split the costs, and whether building a major league-ready stadium without a guaranteed franchise to play on it would be feasible given the enduring financial crisis. The original plans were to break ground in June 2008 and finish the arena in 2010, but by 2009, it was revealed the stalled project had not even done a traffic study despite being located near a busy intersection. In 2010, the plans were changed to use an area behind the Imperial Palace. However, given the financing would require a special taxation district, opposition from Clark County regarding using public money in the project stalled it even further. AEG eventually backed out completely by 2012, once MGM Resorts International came {{up with their own}} project using a terrain behind the New York-New York and Monte Carlo resorts.

40|$|There is some {{controversy}} {{on the key}} sources of success in the private equity model and on how this business model affects the portfolio companies. We investigate financial distress risks of European <b>companies</b> around the <b>buyout</b> event in the period between 2000 and 2008. In addition, we analyze whether <b>buyout</b> <b>companies</b> go bankrupt more often than comparable non-buyout companies. Our paper suggests that private equity investors select companies which are less financially distressed than comparable companies and that the distress risk increases after the buyout. Despite this increase, private equity-backed companies do not suffer from higher bankruptcy rates than non-buyout companies. In fact, when companies are backed by experienced private equity funds, their bankruptcy rates are even lower. Experienced investors seem to {{be better able to}} manage distress risks than their inexperienced counterparts. [...] private equity,buyout,financial distress,bankruptcy...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates value {{creation}} in 31 private equity-owned companies in Norway between 1993 and 2007. Its {{purpose is to}} find evidence on increased value capturing for these companies relative to non-private equity-owned companies. We {{have looked at the}} development of companies that have been engaged in a full leveraged buyout process with Norwegian private equity firms from entry to exit. Value creation is made through several different drivers, which are thoroughly presented in this thesis. The empirical analysis in our thesis has been focusing on {{value creation}} through direct drivers since these drivers may easily be analyzed using publicly available data. By doing statistical tests on ratios that help explaining these drivers, we were able to present evidence on whether private equity-owned companies have been able to outperform their comparables during the private equity firms’ holding period. Our results suggest that private equity firms have been successful in obtaining significant revenue expansion and cost reductions/margin improvements for their portfolio companies on an isolated basis. In terms of improved asset utilization and financial engineering we are unable to provide any adequate significant results. In addition, it seems like <b>buyout</b> <b>companies</b> do not experience any significant changes in employment or changes in levels of wage expenditures. The industry-adjusted results suggest that <b>buyout</b> <b>companies</b> do not significantly outperform their corresponding peers in regard to revenue expansion and cost reductions/margin improvements. <b>Buyout</b> <b>companies</b> seem to have a somewhat stronger improvement in capital productivity than their peers, implying an outperformance from the <b>buyout</b> <b>companies.</b> Moreover, our results do not support any significant changes in long-term debt share during the holding period of private equity firms or large differences in long-term debt levels relative to their peers at entry, exit and exit + 1. Finally, industry-adjusted employment growth and changes in levels of wage expenditures do not support any categorical beliefs about massive lay-offs or drastically reduced wage expenditures during the holding period of a private equity firm...|$|R
5000|$|In 1927, {{ground on}} the {{southeast}} side of town was purchased to use as {{the site for the}} Wichita Municipal Airport. However the Great Depression interrupted construction.

In the 1950s the military took full control of the site and named it McConnell Air Force Base. In 1954, civilian airline service moved to the new Wichita Mid-Continent Airport (now known as the Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport) {{on the west side of}} town. Other airports in Wichita include the Colonel James Jabara Airport and Beech Field. From 1927 to 1929, Travel Air, with Walter Beech at the helm, grew to over 600 employees and operated from a huge factory complex constructed a few miles outside the city. Due to so many employees working at such a large complex, it was dubbed [...] "Travel Air City" [...] by Wichita residents. The company merged with the huge Curtiss-Wright Corporation in the Roaring Twenties' heyday of <b>company</b> <b>buyouts</b> and takeovers just two months before the Stock Market crash in 1929.
