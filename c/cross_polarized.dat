Addition of plates between the polarizers of a {{petrographic}} microscope makes easier the optical identification of minerals in thin sections of rocks, in particular by allowing deduction of {{the shape and}} orientation of the optical indicatrices within the visible crystal sections.

2500|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{the plate}} is inserted between the perpendicular polarizers {{at an angle}} of 45 degrees. This allows two different procedures {{to be carried out}} to investigate the mineral under the crosshairs of the microscope. More simply, in ordinary <b>cross</b> <b>polarized</b> light, the plate can be used to distinguish the orientation of the optical indicatrix relative to crystal elongation – that is, whether the mineral is [...] "length slow" [...] or [...] "length fast" [...] – based on whether the visible interference colors increase or decrease by one order when the plate is added. A slightly more complex procedure allows for a tint plate to be used in conjunction with interference figure techniques to allow measurement of the optic angle of the mineral. The optic angle (often notated as [...] "2V") can both be diagnostic of mineral type, as well as in some cases revealing information about the variation of chemical composition within a single mineral type.|$|E

50|$|Undulose {{extinction}} or undulatory extinction is a geological term {{referring to}} the type of extinction that occurs in certain minerals when examined in thin section under <b>cross</b> <b>polarized</b> light. As the microscope stage is rotated, individual mineral grains appear black when the polarization due to the mineral prevents any light from passing through. If a mineral is deformed plastically by dislocation processes without recovery, strain builds up within the crystal lattice causing it to warp. This means that different parts of a crystal reach extinction at slightly different angles, giving the crystal an irregular, mottled look.|$|E
5000|$|Gananite (...) {{is a rare}} bismuth {{fluoride}} mineral form of bismuth trifluoride with {{a general}} formula of BiF3. Gananite is an isotropic mineral, {{it belongs to the}} space group P43m. This means that Gananite does not show any colors in <b>cross</b> <b>polarized</b> light, because when polarized light passes through it, it does not split into two perpendicular rays. In other words, because Gananite is an isometric mineral, it does not exhibit double refraction. Moreover, this tells us that this mineral is not birefringent. Its color in Plane polarized light is blackish-brown, and it does not show pleochroism.|$|E

50|$|Under a microscope, marrite has a {{distinct}} anisotropic refractive index, meaning the velocity of light varies depending on the direction being traveled through the mineral. It is typical of anisotropic minerals to display colorful, optical properties when viewed under <b>cross</b> <b>polarized</b> light. This differs from its vague gray color when viewed in plane polarized light, which is the reason optical mineralogy is essential for correctly identifying similar minerals. Marrite belongs to the biaxial optical class, which signifies that it has two optic axes. An optic axis is the direction of light that travels at 0 birefringence, causing the mineral to appear isotropic. When viewing the indicatrix of biaxial minerals, both optic axes are always perpendicular {{to one of the}} two circular sections.|$|E
5000|$|Tyrrellite is isometric, {{meaning that}} crystallographically, it has three axes of equal length {{perpendicular}} to one another. It {{belongs to the}} space group, Fd3m. Because tyrrellite is isometric, it is also isotropic. Isotropic minerals are defined as follows: when light passes through an isometric mineral, the light moves in all directions with equal velocity. In contrast, for anisotropic minerals, the velocity of light passing through the mineral varies with crystallographic direction. [...] Tyrrellite displays a light bronze color when viewed in plane polarized light. [...] Because tyrrellite is isotropic, the light bronze color will remain constant as the mineral is rotated and viewed from different crystallographic angles. When viewed under <b>cross</b> <b>polarized</b> light, tyrrellite displays total extinction, a characteristic trait of isotropic minerals.|$|E
50|$|Bird's eye maple, or bird's eye extinction, is a {{specific}} type of extinction exhibited by minerals of the mica group under <b>cross</b> <b>polarized</b> light of the petrographic microscope. It gives the mineral a pebbly appearance as it passes into extinction. This is caused when the grinding tools used to create petrographic thin sections of precise thickness alter the alignment of the previously perfect basal cleavage planes which split micas up into its characteristic thin sheets. The resulting, slightly roughened surface alters the extinction angle of various parts of the crystal lattice, leading to this type of extinction. Since it is not a natural feature of the mineral, bird's eye maple is not observed in all mica crystals, nor from all angles, but it is quite common, and is used as a diagnostic feature for micas.|$|E

25|$|Birefringence is {{utilized}} in medical diagnostics. One powerful accessory used with optical microscopes {{is a pair}} of <b>crossed</b> <b>polarizing</b> filters. Light from the source is polarized in the X direction after passing through the first polarizer, but above the specimen is a polarizer (a so-called analyzer) oriented in the Y direction. Therefore, no light from the source will be accepted by the analyzer, and the field will appear dark. However areas of the sample possessing birefringence will generally couple some of the X-polarized light into the Y polarization; these areas will then appear bright against the dark background. Modifications to this basic principle can differentiate between positive and negative birefringence.|$|R
