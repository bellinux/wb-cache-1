5|$|These powers {{included}} {{the ability to}} both restrict tribal powers or to relax such restrictions. <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> done both, {{such as in the}} withdrawal of federal recognition of the Menominee tribe with the Menominee Termination Act in 1954, and the Menominee Restoration Act to restore tribal recognition and powers. The earlier decisions in Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant dealt with cases where Congress had restricted a tribe's inherent powers but pointed at nothing in the Constitution or established precedent that prohibits Congress from relaxing such restrictions. The decision in Duro was one of federal common law, and it is clear that <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> the power to change that law. Since the power exercised by the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe was that of inherent tribal sovereignty, double jeopardy did not attach.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} {{hours of the}} rioting, state media only {{reported}} that three people had been killed. The number rose sharply, though, after the first night's rioting; at midday on Monday, 6 July, Xinhua announced that 129 people had died. In the following days the death toll reported by various government sources (including Xinhua and party officials) gradually grew, with the last official update on 18 July placing the tally at 197 dead, 1,721 injured. The World Uyghur <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> claimed that the death toll was around 600.|$|E
5|$|If the Saxbe fix is a {{solution}} for the primary problem of self-dealing, a relevant fact is that <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to {{the president in the}} form of an across-the-board cost of living adjustment by executive order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by executive order. Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by Duke University School of Law professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{designation}} {{was created}} in 1930 out of {{the southern end of}} US127. Three sets of reroutings through Adrian have resulted in the creation of two different business loops through the city. A change proposed in the 1960s and implemented in the 1970s shifted the southern end of US223 to replace M-151 and then run along the US23 freeway between Whiteford Township, Michigan, and Sylvania, Ohio. Since the 1980s, US223 no longer reaches Toledo, instead feeding into the freeway system for the city. Changes proposed and enacted into law in the 1990s would upgrade the highway as an Interstate Highway. <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> designated this corridor as part of Interstate 73 (I-73), although neither state intends at this time to complete the freeway.|$|E
50|$|In this case, the Court {{held that}} <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> imposed a coercive federal {{regulatory}} scheme on farm production under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 (AAA). By entering into contracts with farmers who reduced their output of selected crops, <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> placed non-participating farmers at a distinct disadvantage to farmers who cooperated. As such, {{the program was}} not truly voluntary as it left the farmers no real choice; the options for the farmers were either cooperation or financial ruin. Under those circumstances, the regulatory scheme essentially required submission of farmers to a regulatory scheme <b>Congress</b> <b>had</b> no power to impose on its own.|$|R

5|$|George Washington had {{fourteen}} handwritten {{copies of}} the Bill of Rights made, one for Congress and {{one for each of}} the original thirteen states.

Two unidentified {{copies of the}} missing four (thought to be the Georgia and Maryland copies) survive; one is in the National Archives, and the other is in the New York Public Library. North Carolina's copy was stolen from the State Capitol by a Union soldier following the Civil War. In an FBI sting operation, it was recovered in 2003. The copy retained by the First <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> been on display (along with the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence) in the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom room at the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. since December 13, 1952.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of the United States regulates the music industry, enforces intellectual property laws, and promotes and collects certain kinds of music. Under American copyright law, musical works, including recordings and compositions, are protected as intellectual property {{as soon as they}} are fixed in a tangible form. Copyright holders often register their work with the Library of Congress, which maintains a collection of the material. In addition, the Library of <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> actively sought out culturally and musicologically significant materials since the early 20th century, such as by sending researchers to record folk music. These researchers include the pioneering American folk song collector Alan Lomax, whose work helped inspire the roots revival of the mid-20th century. The federal government also funds the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, which allocate grants to musicians and other artists, the Smithsonian Institution, which conducts research and educational programs, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds non-profit and television broadcasters.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} on November 11, 1926, along {{a series of}} existing state highways from Lansing southward toward Toledo. In 1930, the southern end was rerouted south of Somerset in rural northwestern Lenawee County to a course that ran directly south to the Ohio state line; the remainder was renumbered US223. Starting in the 1950s, the highway was reconfigured to bypass Mason and other communities, converting US127 into a freeway from Jackson to the Lansing area by the mid-1970s. When the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) successfully petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in 1999 to remove US27 from the state, US127 was to be extended northward from Lansing to Grayling as the replacement designation. This change was made in 2002, resulting in the current configuration of the highway in Michigan. The United States <b>Congress</b> <b>has</b> designated an additional Interstate Highway, {{to be part of}} I-73, that would replace most or all of US127 through Central and Southern Michigan, but any plans by MDOT to complete this highway were cancelled in 2001.|$|E
