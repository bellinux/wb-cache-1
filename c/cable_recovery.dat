40|$|Subsurface {{power grids}} {{constitute}} {{one of the}} largest copper stocks in many industrialized cities. Over time, parts and zones of these systems have been continuously disconnected and abandoned, resulting in the emergence of urban infrastructure ores. This study aims to assess how current conditions and practices influence economic and environmental motives of <b>cable</b> <b>recovery</b> from such power grids. By applying an infrastructure managers perspective and evaluating 16 scenarios involving different extraction technologies and procedures, surface materials, urban locations and types of cables, we identify key areas where solutions or changes to increase incentives for <b>cable</b> <b>recovery</b> are needed. The assessed scenarios display significantly different cable extraction costs, where excavation in city centers with asphalt or cobblestone pavements generates the highest costs while greenbelts offer the best conditions. In most cases, cable revenues are not even close to outweighing the extraction costs. This is especially true for paper-coated cables or cables with aluminum conductors, for which the revenues are much lower than for plastic-insulated copper cables. Although economic conditions could be improved by integrating <b>cable</b> <b>recovery</b> to regular system upgrade projects or by applying non-digging technologies, clear incentives rely on the cable in question being especially valuable. Most of the <b>cable</b> <b>recovery</b> scenarios display environmental motives in terms of net savings in GHG emissions due to metal recycling. In contrast to the economic results, recycling of aluminum power cables is here more awarding than that of corresponding copper cables. We conclude that under current conditions urban mining does not make economic sense to infrastructure managers unless it is integrated as an added value to system upgrade projects. Apart from such re-arrangements in infrastructure provision, several other practice-related changes to cut cable extraction costs are possibly within reach for the managers. Still, an economically motivated practice relies on several external performance drivers such as market diffusion of non-digging technologies, improved cable recycling processes, and increased scrap metal prices. Our conclusion that the arguments for urban mining are currently more environmental than financial, points towards changed perspectives where such activities are seen as a way for infrastructure managers to contribute to societal goals such as climate change mitigation and reduced mineral resource dependence.

5000|$|Reacquired {{five years}} later, Naubuc was {{reinstated}} to the Naval Vessel Register 1 June 1967 arid {{scheduled to be}} converted to a Salvage Craft Tender. In March 1968 she was reclassified (ARST-4) and assigned to the 13th Naval District for conversion. In her later years, she was outfitted with four 12-cylinder diesel engines that powered four rotating thrusters mounted on vertical shafts. She was configured as a cable laying and implantment vessel with a cable drum located in the bow along with a cable guide going over the stern. The four thrusters allowed the vessel to stay [...] "on station". When underway, however, only the two bow or stern thrusters were operated at any one time. The vertical thruster shafts increased the vessel's draft significantly. The thrusters were easily damaged by impact with the bottom. The Naubuc's final mission was as a support vessel for a <b>cable</b> underwater <b>recovery</b> vehicle (CURV-2) in the Tongue of the Ocean, off Andros Island.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The AdVAntage ArmTM is an above-elbow (AE) body-powered arm {{designed}} to improve upon, and overcome, {{some of the major}} limitations of conventional prostheses. It is the result of research and development (R&D) accomplished at the Center for Engineering Design (CED), University of Utah and Sarcos Research Corporation (SRC), Salt Lake City, UT. The AdVAntage Arm was developed to provide the following main features: lightweight, independent elbow and terminal device (TD) control, and a <b>cable</b> <b>recovery</b> system for full TD actuation at any elbow position. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Rehab R&D Service's Technology Transfer Section (TTS), with collaboration from the VA National Prosthetic and Sensory Aids Service (PSAS), managed a multi-center clinical evaluation of the precommercial AdVAntage Arm (the Arm). The purpose was to objectively assess and affirm the Arm's functional advantages, reliability, clinical application, and commercial readiness. Eleven VA prosthetic services served as evaluation sites with a total of 16 subjects with amputation (14 unilateral and 2 bilateral). Fifteen prosthetists provided their comments. Overall, the results demonstrated that the Arm could be fit for use by persons with transhumeral amputation. Once the learning curve was overcome, the majority of subjects reported that the Arm offered several functional advantages over thei...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the dynamics of low tension marine cables. These cables are widely used in the ocean environment for signal and power transmission applications. There are two main issues in the dynamic analysis of such cables. When the tension is zero, which is often the situation encountered at the seabed during cable laying, the cable geometric stiffness matrix becomes singular. The other issue is that the transformation from local co-ordinates to global co-ordinates made through Euler angles leads to a greater number of unknowns than the number of differential equations. The former problem can be overcome by taking into account the flexural rigidity of the cable. The latter problem can be overcome by assuming that one of the Euler angles is known. However, this procedure can introduce singularities on the formulation of the problem. A new three dimensional model for the dynamics of marine cables is presented in this thesis. The model takes into account the bending stiffness of the cable in order to overcome singularities in the geometric stiffness matrix. In order to overcome the problem owing to the use of Euler angles, a new displacement approach is introduced. This new displacement approach uses the differential geometry definition of curvature and torsion in order to establish the transformation from the local co-ordinates to the global co-ordinates. The general formulation of the dynamics of marine cables presented in this thesis is applicable {{to a wide range of}} cases such as towed cables, cable installation and <b>cable</b> <b>recovery.</b> In order to illustrate this new formulation the cases of towed cables and cable installation are investigated in the some detail. Solutions for the differential equations of motion are presented for two and three dimensions. The two dimensional solution is obtained through a finite element based technique which uses a weak Galerkin formulation for integration in space and the Newmark method for integration in time. The model's results are compared with full scale measurements. Simulations of the dynamic response of marine cables to vessel wave induced motions and vessel changes in speed are also presented. The three dimensional solution is obtained by expressing the equations of motion as functions of the Euler angles. The space integration is also performed by a finite element model but it uses a finite difference scheme for the time integration. This solution is then used to study the influence of sheared cross-currents in the cable's configuration. Finally, conclusions and suggestions for further research are presented...|$|E
5000|$|Niagara sailed from New York on 22 April 1857 for England, {{arriving}} Gravesend on 14 May. A log of the ship's voyage {{across the}} Atlantic was {{kept by the}} correspondent of the New York Daily Times, where it was published on Thursday, 14 May 1857. On arrival in England Niagara was equipped to lay cable for the first transatlantic telegraph, which was to follow the shallow tableland discovered between Newfoundland and Ireland by Matthew F. Maury. By 11 August, when {{a break in the}} <b>cable</b> defied <b>recovery,</b> she had laid several hundred miles westward from Valentia Island, Ireland. She returned to New York 20 November and decommissioned 2 December to prepare for a second essay at cable-laying. Recommissioning 24 February 1858, Captain William L.

On 5 August, Niagara's boats carried the end of the cable ashore at Bay Bulls Arm , Newfoundland, and the same day Agamemnon landed her end of the cable. The first message flashed across 16 August, when Queen Victoria sent a cable to President James Buchanan. This first cable operated for three weeks; ultimate success came in 1866.|$|R
40|$|The {{capability}} of autonomous operation of ship-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in extreme sea conditions would greatly extend {{the usefulness of}} these aircraft for both military and civilian maritime purposes. Maritime operations are often associated with Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) procedures, even though the advantages of conventional fixed-wing aircraft over VTOL aircraft in terms of flight speed, range and endurance are well known. In this work, current methods of shipboard recovery are analysed and {{the problems associated with}} recovery in adverse weather conditions are identified. Based on this analysis, a novel recovery method is proposed. This method, named <b>Cable</b> Hook <b>Recovery,</b> is intended to recover small to medium-size fixed-wing UAVs on frigate-size vessels. It is expected to have greater operational capabilities than the Recovery Net technique, which is currently the most widely employed method of recovery for similar class of UAVs, potentially providing safe recovery even in very rough sea and allowing the choice of approach directions. The recovery method is supported by the development of a UAV controller that realises the most demanding stage of recovery, the final approach. The controller provides both flight control and guidance strategy that allow fully autonomous recovery of a fixed-wing UAV. The development process involves extensive use of specially tailored Evolutionary Algorithms and represents the major contribution of this work. The Evolutionary Design algorithm developed in this work combines the power of Evolutionary Strategies and Genetic Programming, enabling automatic evolution of both the structure and parameters of the controller. The controller is evolved using a fully coupled nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom UAV model, making linearisation and trimming of the model unnecessary. The developed algorithm is applied to both flight control and guidance problems with several variations, from optimisation of a routine PID controller to automatic control laws synthesis where no a priori data available. It is demonstrated that Evolutionary Design is capable of not only optimising, but also solving automatically the real-world problems, producing human-competitive solutions. The designed UAV controller has been tested comprehensively for both performance and robustness in a nonlinear simulation environment and has been found to allow the aircraft to be recovered in the presence of both large external disturbances and uncertainty in the simulation models...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of past world wars and the dumping of munition at {{designated}} dumping areas, residual military ordnance are found on and in the seabed, especially in the Wadden Sea, North Sea and Baltic Sea. Of the estimated 1. 5 million tons of military ordnance, roughly ten percent is classified as Unexploded Ordnance (UXO). There are three main arguments for removing the military ordnance: environmental protection, human safety and project related. Current study {{will focus on the}} project related removal of munition, specifically for offshore wind <b>cable</b> installation projects. <b>Recovery</b> of UXO is often preferred over redirection of the cable route due to cost savings. Current state of the art methods use dedicated clearance ROV's and divers to remove the munition ordnance. However, these methods prove to be dangerous, inefficient or even impossible to use in shallow water areas (0 - 10 m) with strong tidal currents. The objective of current study is to develop a remotely-operated munitions detection and removal concept for use in coastal water areas and assess its feasibility. First, a programme of requirements for the novel concept is obtained. During a systematic ideation process, fifteen different conceptual ideas are conceived and compared in a multi-criteria analysis from which the most promising concept is chosen: an excavator carrying a munitions toolskid on a moored pontoon. The second part of the study focuses on assessing the feasibility of the proposed concept for two project sites. Specifically for this study, the workability in waves is assessed. Limiting criteria are defined for two critical components on the munitions toolskid to ensure a safe operation; the motion amplitude of the detection coils, limited to X cm vertical motion and the motion amplitude of the manipulators, limited to X cm absolute motion. The latter limit is based on user experience of existing ROV operations and is thus subject to interpretation. The motion amplitude of manipulator and detection coils is modelled by combining three sources of motion; backlash mobilization in the excavator, bending deflection of the excavator arm and wave induced pontoon motions. Three different types of mooring are modelled; gravity spuds, backhoe-type spuds (i. e. preloaded spuds) and a jack-up system. Results of the workability assessment for two case studies show that the gravity spuds pontoon is not a feasible solution, mainly due to the freedom of heaving and pitching. Both defined motion limits are exceeded by more than X m. When using backhoe spuds or jack-up system, the criterion for the scanning coils is satisfied. The criterion for the manipulators is slightly exceeded by respectively X cm and X cm absolute motion for the backhoe and jack-up system. It can be concluded that none of the assessed solutions is workable if an exceedance of the motion limit for the manipulator is strictly prohibited. However, considering the exceedance of the limit is slight and the motion limit of the manipulator should be interpreted as an indication, the backhoe and jack-up system may prove to be workable solutions. Reassessment of the limiting criterion for the manipulator is required to give insight if a slight exceedance of the limit is allowable.

40|$|The Atlantic City {{borehole}} was {{the second}} site drilled {{as part of the}} New Jersey coastal plain drilling project, Leg 150 X. It focused on middle middle Miocene to Oligocene "Icehouse" and middle-upper Eocene "Doubthouse" sequences known from previous rotary and <b>cable</b> tool wells. <b>Recovery</b> was not as good as at Island Beach (60 % vs. 87 %) because of hole stability problems; however, recovery was excellent for most of the critical lower-middle Miocene interval (390 - 937 ft; 81 %). The surficial Cape May Formation (uppermost Pleistocene-Holocene; 123 ft thick) contains nearshore gravelly sand and clay at the top and fluvial deposits at the base that apparently correlate with the Cape May Formation at Island Beach. The ?middle Miocene Cohansey Formation (96 ft thick) sand and sandy clay represents fluvial deposits not present at Island Beach. The ages of both units are uncertain. Recovery of the uppermost part of the 706 -ft-thick Kirkwood Formation was poor (no recovery from 293 to 390 ft), but recovery for the Kirkwood between 390 and 937 ft was excellent. The sand, silts, and clay facies expressed in the Kirkwood Formation at Atlantic City represent diverse fluvial, nearshore, and neritic (including prodelta) environments. Several upward-coarsening sequences can be recognized on the basis of lithofacies breaks, gamma-log changes, and hiatuses, corresponding with confining units at the base and aquifer units at the top. These lithostratigraphic and geohydrologic units correspond with similar units at Island Beach, and we suggest that they correlate. Numerous shell beds in the Atlantic City borehole allow preliminary dating of these sequences with Sr-isotopic stratigraphy, including the middle middle Miocene Kirkwood 3 sequence (13. 3 - 13. 5 Ma; from at least 401. 7 to at least 470 ft), the upper lower Miocene Kirkwood 2 sequence 17. 0 17. 9 Ma; 512 - 666 ft), and the uppermost Oligocene to lower Miocene Kirkwood 1 sequence (20. 3 - 25. 8 Ma; 666 - 937 ft). The Kirkwood 1 sequence may be divided into several additional sequences that have dramatic shell beds at their base and distinct ages determined by Sr isotopes: 20. 3 - 21. 9 Ma, 23. 6 - 23. 7 Ma, and - 25. 8 Ma. A sharp lithologic and gamma-log break at 741 ft may indicate another sequence boundary between 20. 3 and 20. 8 Ma, although Sr-isotopic resolution is not sufficient to document this hiatus unequivocally. The upper Eocene-Oligocene may be divided further into 3 sequences based on lithologic and gamma log changes that were dated with Sr isotopes: upper Oligocene (27. 4 - 28. 7 Ma), lower Oligocene (- 33. 4 Ma), and upper Eocene (36. 6 - 37. 7 Ma). Biostratigraphy is consistent with the Sr-isotopic ages and indicates additional lower upper Eocene and upper middle Eocene sequences. The systems tracts are generally well developed for these middle Eocene through middle Miocene sequences, with a basal shell or glauconite sand at the base and sands at the top. Further biostratigraphic and Sr-isotopic studies should refine the ages of the sequences, whereas lithostratigraphic and benthic foraminifer biofacies studies should reveal details of the depositional environments and systems tracts of these well-developed sequences...|$|R
40|$|The ROV {{operations}} {{had three}} objectives: (1) to check, whether the "Cherokee" system is suited for advanced benthological {{work in the}} high latitude Antarctic shelf areas; (2) to support the disturbance experiment, providing immediate visual Information; (3) to continue ecological work that started in 1989 at the hilltop situated at the northern margin of the Norsel Bank off the 4 -Seasons Inlet (Weddell Sea). The "Cherokee" is was equipped with 3 video cameras, 2 of which support the operation. A high resolution Tritech Typhoon camera is used for scientific observations to be recorded. In addition, the ROV has a manipulator, a still camera, lights and strobe, compass, 2 lasers, a Posidonia transponder and an obstacle avoidance Sonar. The size of the vehicle is 160 X 90 X 90 cm. In the present configuration without TMS (tether management system) the deployment has to start with paying out the full cable length, lay it in loops on deck and connect the glass fibres at the tether's spool winch. After a final technical check the vehicle is deployed into the water, actively driven perpendicular to the ship's axis and floatings are fixed to the tether. At a cable length of approx. 50 m, the tether is tightened to the depressor by several cable ties and both components are lowered towards the sea floor, the vehicle by the thruster's propulsion and the depressor by the ship's winch. At 5 m intervals the tether has to be tied to the single conductor cable. In good weather conditions the instruments supporting the navigation of the ROV, especially the Posidonia system, allow an operation mode to follow the ship's course if the ship's speed is slow. Together with the lasers which act as a scale in the images they also allow a reproducible scientific analysis since the transect can be plotted in a GIS system. Consequently, the area observed can be easily calculated. An operation as a predominantly drifting system, especially in areas with bottom near currents, is also possible, however, the connection of the tether {{at the rear of}} the vehicle is unsuitable for such conditions. The recovery of the system corresponds to that of the deployment. Most important is to reach the surface of the sea at a safe distance perpendicular to the ship's axis in order not to interfere with the ship's propellers. During this phase the Posidonia transponder system is of high relevance although it has to be switched off at a water depth of approx. 40 m. The minimum personal needed is 4 persons to handle the tether on deck, one person to operate the ship's winch, one pilot and one additional technician for the ROV's operation itself, one scientist, and one person on the ship's bridge in addition to one on deck for whale watching when the Posidonia system is in use. The time for the deployment of the ROV until it reaches the sea floor depends on the water depth and consequently on the length of the cable to be paid out beforehand and to be tightened to the single conductor <b>cable.</b> Deployment and <b>recovery</b> at intermediate water depths can last up to 2 hours each. A reasonable time for benthological observations close to the sea floor is 1 to 3 hours but can be extended if scientifically justified. Preliminary results: after a first test station, the ROV was deployed 3 times for observations related to the disturbance experiment. A first attempt to Cross the hilltop at the northern margin of the Norsel Bank close to the 4 - Seasons Inlet was successful only for the first hundreds of metres transect length. The benthic community was dominated in biomass by the demosponge Cinachyra barbata. Due to the strong current of approx. 1 nm/h, the design of the system, and an expected more difficult current regime between grounded icebergs and the top of the hilltop the operation was stopped before the hilltop was reached. In a second attempt the hilltop was successfully crossed because the current and wind situation was much more suitable. In contrast to earlier expeditions with the "sprint" ROV it was the first time that both slopes, the smoother in the northeast and the steeper in the southwest were continuously observed during one cast. A coarse classification of the hilltop fauna shows patches dominated by single taxa: cnidarians, hydrozoans, holothurians, sea urchins and stalked sponges. Approximately 20 % of the north-eastern slope was devastated by grounding icebergs. Here the sediments consisted of large boulders, gravel or blocks of finer sediment looking like an irregularly ploughed field. On the Norsel Bank the Cinachyra concentrations were locally associated with high abundances of sea anemones. Total observation time amounted to 11. 5 hours corresponding to almost 6 - 9 km transect length...|$|R
