40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{application}} and optimization of biotechnological methods within the family Brassicaceae. Most of this thesis is focused specifically the genus Brassica. The main objective of this dissertation thesis was to optimize and apply selected biotechnological methods in the resynthesis of oilseed rape (B. napus) from its baseline species (B. oleracea, CC and B. rapa, AA) and subsequently create valuable genetic plant materials. The optimized procedure implemented in my work have exhibited better results of hybrid production (resynthesis) than in similar published experiments and provides a simplified and less laborious method via simple ovule culture and early hybrid verification. The next accomplished step was to work with a wider range of materials using a broader source of different and contrasting genotypes from Brassica rapa (spring and winter oilseed and vegetable turnips) and B. oleracea (green and purple <b>curly</b> <b>kales</b> and cabbages) for new combinations and wider genetic diversity. It was concluded that the optimized ovule culture protocol with early verification, developed in the framework of this thesis, is satisfactorily sufficient enough to be applicable in breeding programmes, aimed at diversity expansion of winter oilseed rape gene pool, as the resynthesized embryos were derived in most combinations. New resynthesized verified lines were colchicine treated in order to obtain diploid regenerants and the fertile plants were self-pollinized and crossed with elite oilseed rape lines for further research and breeding...|$|R

50|$|<b>Curly</b> <b>kale</b> {{is used in}} Denmark and southwestern Sweden (Scania, Halland and Blekinge) to make (grøn-)langkål (Danish) or långkål (Swedish), an {{obligatory}} dish on the julbord in the region, and {{is commonly}} served together with the Christmas ham (Sweden). The leaves of the kale are separated from the stem, and then boiled with stock. The result is drained and pressed to remove the remaining liquid. The kale can now be frozen for up to 6-8 months if needed. To make langkål, finely chop the (defrosted) kale and fry it with cream, pepper, and syrup (or sugar) for sweetening.

50|$|While this {{chemical}} {{will prevent}} {{the growth of}} bacteria, it can be toxic in high amounts for animals and humans. Sodium nitrite's LD50 in rats is 180 mg/kg and its human LDLo is 71 mg/kg, meaning a 65 kg person would likely have to consume at least 4.6 g to result in death. To prevent toxicity, sodium nitrite (blended with salt) sold as a food additive is dyed bright pink to avoid mistaking it for plain salt or sugar. Nitrites are not naturally occurring in vegetables in significant quantities. However, nitrates are found in commercially available vegetables and a study in an intensive agricultural area in northern Portugal found residual nitrate levels in 34 vegetable samples, including different varieties of cabbage, lettuce, spinach, parsley and turnips ranged between 54 and 2440 mg/kg, e.g. <b>curly</b> <b>kale</b> (302.0 mg/kg) and green cauliflower (64 mg/kg). Boiling vegetables lowers nitrate but not nitrite. Fresh meat contains 0.4-0.5 mg/kg nitrite and 4-7 mg/kg of nitrate (10-30 mg/kg nitrate in cured meats). The presence of nitrite in animal tissue {{is a consequence of}} metabolism of nitric oxide, an important neurotransmitter. Nitric oxide can be created de novo from nitric oxide synthase utilizing arginine or from ingested nitrate or nitrite.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} get more insight into the {{interaction}} between atmospheric and pedospheric sulfur nutrition, the impact of H 2 S on sulfur metabolism was investigated in two varieties of Brassica oleracea L., viz. <b>curly</b> <b>kale</b> and Chinese cabbage. Measurements on the total sulfur content and relative growth rate of the two varieties showed that Chinese cabbage had a lower need for sulfur and correspondingly a lower sulfate uptake rate than <b>curly</b> <b>kale.</b> Both in <b>curly</b> <b>kale</b> and Chinese cabbage {{a large proportion of}} total sulfur was present as sulfate. However, the sulfate content of the roots and shoot was hardly affected at pedospheric sulfate concentration levels ranging from 0. 25 up to 10 mM, reflecting a carefully regulated sulfate uptake by the roots. Upon exposure to 0. 25 mul l(- 1) H 2 S, an atmospheric level sufficient to meet the sulfur need of the plants, the sulfate uptake by the roots was reduced in <b>curly</b> <b>kale</b> and Chinese cabbage by 54 and 30 %, respectively. H 2 S exposure resulted in an increase in thiol level in the shoots, whereas that in the roots was hardly affected, demonstrating that thiols have limited significance in the shoot to root signaling of the regulation of the sulfate uptake. The contents of total sulfur, sulfate and glucosinolates remained unaffected upon H 2 S exposure. Evidently there is a good coordination between the metabolism of atmospheric H 2 S and pedospheric sulfate in both varieties of Brassica oleracea...|$|E
40|$|AbstractKale is a nutrient-dense, dark-green leafy {{vegetable}} often eaten raw in salads or added to smoothies. The USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference Release 26 reports the weight for one cup raw, chopped kale as 67 grams, {{among the highest}} for raw {{leafy vegetable}}s. Objectives: Measure the weight of one cup moderately packed raw kale with stems and tough midrib parts removed and evaluate {{the impact of the}} new cup weight on nutrient intake of individuals consumingraw kale. Methods: Six staff members measured curly and lacinato kale using standard procedures and 14 study participantsconsuming 4 - 6 cups raw leafy vegetables/day measured one cup <b>curly</b> <b>kale</b> in their usual manner. Twenty-seven dietary recalls obtained from participants following the Wahls™ diet were entered intothe Nutrition Data System for Research and then recalculated using staff-measured <b>curly</b> <b>kale</b> cup weight. Results: Mean(SE) staff cup weight for lacinato kale was significantly higher than <b>curly</b> <b>kale</b> [21. 3 (1. 4) g vs 16. 0 (1. 4) g; p< 0. 0001]. Percent refuse was also higher for lacinato kale [mean(SD) 42. 0 (11. 4) % vs 28. 5 (3. 9) %; p= 0. 012]. Mean(SD) weight of moderately packed participant-measured cups [17. 5 (6. 4) g]was similar to staff cup weightbutfirmly packed participant cupsweighed more [46. 4 (4. 1) g]. Intake of vitamins K, C, A, manganese, copper, and folatewere significantly lower for diets calculated with the staff cup weight (p< 0. 0001). Conclusions: The new measured cup weight of raw kale is lower than previously reportedand reduces nutrient levels in diets containing raw kale. Verification of cup weights for other raw leafy vegetables may be warranted...|$|E
40|$|Glucosinolates are {{important}} secondary compounds, {{commonly found in}} Brassicaceae. To what extent these sulfur and nitrogen containing compounds contribute to the total sulfur pool was investigated. In various cultivars of Brassica oleracea viz. <b>curly</b> <b>kale,</b> pointed cabbage, red cabbage, savoy cabbage and white cabbage, total glucosinolate content and composition of the glucosinolate pool (aliphatic, aromatic and indolyl glucosinolates) were measured, together with determination of the total and inorganic sulfur and nitrogen contents. Differences in {{the contents of the}} individual glucosinolates were found between cultivars and plant parts. In all cultivars the total glucosinolate content was highest in the roots. Roots of <b>curly</b> <b>kale</b> had the highest gluconasturtiin content (12. 6 mumol g(- 1) DW), while the shoot of white cabbage had the lowest glucoiberin content (0. 3 mumol g(- 1) DW). Between all cultivars significant differences in glucosinolate content per class were found. Aromatic glucosinolates were highest in the roots of <b>curly</b> <b>kale,</b> accounting for 63 % of the total content, while the roots of savoy cabbage had the highest aliphatic glucosinolate content (8. 1 mumol g(- 1) DW). Expression of the total glucosinolate fraction on a total sulfur basis showed that the contribution of the glucosinolate fraction was very low (1 - 2 %). Since a large amount of total sulfur was present as sulfate (70 - 88 %). total glucosinolate content was also expressed on an organic sulfur basis. These values ranged between 10 - 23 %, for white cabbage and savoy cabbage, respectively. We conclude that expression on an organic sulfur basis is a better parameter to assess the fraction of glucosinolates than on a total sulfur basis. In addition, the organic fraction appears to be a better parameter to define the sulfur requirement for structural growth...|$|E

40|$|Ornamental plants {{growing in}} urban areas are exposed to soil {{salinity}} that negatively affects their quality. Identifying species that retain high ornamental value despite salt stress is therefore of high practical importance. <b>Curly</b> <b>kale</b> (Brassica oleracea L. var. sabellica L.) is an attractive plant with leaves of both edible and ornamental character. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate a response of ornamental <b>curly</b> <b>kale</b> to different concentrations of NaCl. The study material was 'Scarlet' cultivar. The plants were grown in pots in a plastic tunnel. They were irrigated with NaCl solution at the following concentrations: 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mM mmol•dm- 3. NaCl treatment resulted in a significant increase in pH and electrical conductivity (EC) of the substrate. Salt stress significantly affected plant growth and number, width and length of leaves, and the effects depended on NaCl concentration. Fifteen days after the salt supply ceased, relative chlorophyll content in leaves (SPAD) decreased due to NaCl treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatments with 200, 400, and 800 mmol•dm- 3 NaCl reduced stomatal conductance, and the changes were greater on the 5 th day following the stress cessation than on the 15 th day. Irrigation with a 200, 400, and 800 mmol•dm- 3 NaCl solution negatively affected plant bonitation score.

40|$|The {{exposure}} to dioxins (including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls) occurs predominantly via the intake of food. The main {{contribution to the}} total intake originates from the consumption of animal fat. Nevertheless, vegetables were estimated to contribute 13 % to the total dietary intake, although the uncertainty in this figure was considered large (Freijer et al., 2001). In the present study, a detailed investigation into the concentrations of dioxins in vegetables and subsequently the intake via the consumption of vegetables is calculated. To that aim, eighteen different vegetables were bought in eight Dutch retail shops in two different seasons. The samples were pooled per season and analysed for dioxins. The summer vegetables could be measured very sensitively: the maximum levels (assuming that samples below the limit of detection -LOD- equal a concentration equal to the LOD) vary between 3 and 10 pg toxic equivalents (TEQ) per kg fresh weight (FW). The winter vegetables could be measured less sensitively; the LOD for each congener was approximately 10 pg TEQ/kg FW. The maximum levels (with the exception of <b>curly</b> <b>kale)</b> vary between 30 and 70 pg TEQ/kg FW. The average level in <b>curly</b> <b>kale</b> is estimated as 100 - 200 pg TEQ/ kg FW. Using the maximum levels, the average intake of dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs by the consumption of vegetables is estimated as 0. 12 pg TEQ/kg bodyweight/day. When a consistency of patterns between detected and non-detected levels is assumed, the most likely estimate is 0. 014 pg TEQ/ kg bodyweight/day.

At 0. 2 mu l l(- 1) H 2 S, a level sufficient to meet the sulfur need of plants for growth, the sulfate uptake was maximally decreased by 50 % after 3 or 4 days of exposure. Higher levels up to 0. 8 mu l l(- 1) H 2 S did not further affect the sulfate uptake. The nitrate uptake was not affected upon exposure to 0. 2 - 0. 8 mu l l(- 1) H 2 S. H 2 S exposure {{did not affect the}} sulfate content of the plants, but it {{resulted in}} an increased content of thiols and cysteine in the shoots, whereas that in the roots was hardly affected. Plants grown under sulfate-deprived conditions had a decreased biomass production, very low content of sulfate and decreased content of thiols in both shoot and roots. Sulfate-deprived plants had a two-fold higher sulfate uptake after transfer to a sulfate-containing solution, while nitrate uptake was decreased by 50 %, When sulfate-deprived plants were exposed to 0. 25 mu l l-(1) H 2 S, plant biomass production and nitrate uptake were restored but the sulfate uptake after transfer to a sulfate-containing solution remained high.

40|$|Hydrogen {{sulphide}} (H 2 S) gas {{has been}} found to delay the appearance of many characteristics associated with senescence of horticultural produce but little attention has been given to its physiological role or its interaction with ethylene. This study used the green leafy vegetable, pak choy (Brassica rapa subsp.

Hydrogen sulphide also inhibited chlorophyll loss and respiration of other green leafy vegetables/herbs, sweet Italian basil (Ocimum basilicum) and green <b>curly</b> <b>kale</b> (Brassica oleracea var. sabellica). The results suggest that the mode of action of hydrogen sulphide in delaying senescence could be by inhibiting both the production of ethylene and the action of ethylene.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study on dioxin levels in samples of <b>curly</b> <b>kale,</b> collected in deposition areas of municipal waste incinerators and a metal reclamation plant as well as in background locations in the Netherlands. From earlier reports on environmental contamination with dioxins it is known that in areas within a few kilometers of waste incinerators, elevated dioxin levels can be found in top soil, grass and a consequence of this, in cow's milk from locally situated dairy farms. Therefore, it was assumed that in the same areas elevated levels can be found in outside growing crops especially <b>curly</b> <b>kale.</b> For these reasons, the first objective was to obtain more insight in levels of the seventeen toxic polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorodibenzofurans in samples of kale collected in suspected and non-suspected areas, whereas the second objective was to produce more data on dioxin levels in kale to enable assessments of the additional intake of dioxins by the Dutch population by consumption of kale and other leafy vegetables. In February 1991, {{at the end of the}} growth period, fourteen samples of kale were collected in deposition areas of two municipal waste incinerators and one metal reclamation plant and two background locations. Strategy in sampling preparation was directed to obtain representative data on dioxin levels in kale for each of the five regions at a limited number of 15 - 20 samples reserved for this study. Analyses were performed by the use of in-house standard operating procedures for extraction, isolation and GC/MS-analysis of purified extracts. It appeared that no elevated levels chould be found in samples of kale from depostion areas. The dioxin levels of the fourteen samples ranged between 0. 52 and 1. 3 with a mean of 0. 87 +- 0. 06 pg 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD-equivalents (using International REFs) per g dry weight (pg TEQ/g dry weight). According to consumption data from the Dutch Food Consumption Study 1987 - 1988, a yearly average of 2 g of kale per person per day is consumed. Using a dioxin level of 1 pg TEQ/g dry weight and an average dry matter content of 15 wt%, and additional daily intake of 0. 3 pg TEQ per person can be calculated. When compared to an earlier reported median intake of 70 pg TEQ per person per day by consumption of food products mainly derived from animal fats and oils, a negligible additional intake is obtained by consumption of kale. By extrapolation of these figures to other (leafy) vegetables and fruits, a maximal additional daily intake has been estimated of about 8 pg TEQ per person per day. ...|$|E
40|$|Both {{activity}} and expression of sulfate transporters and APS reductase in plants are modulated by the sulfur {{status of the}} plant. To examine the regulatory mechanisms in <b>curly</b> <b>kale</b> (Brossica olerracea L.), the sulfate supply was manipulated by the transfer of seedlings to sulfate-deprived conditions, which resulted in an up to 3 -fold increase in the sulfate uptake capacity by the root, accompanied by an induction of transcript abundances of the Group 1 and 4 sulfate transporters in root and shoot. Upon sulfate re-supply, there was no correlation between the {{activity and}} expression of the sulfate transporters. Despite the decrease in the abundance of the sulfate transporter transcripts, especially {{at the onset of}} the sulfate re-supply, the sulfate uptake capacity was affected very little for up to 96 h. There was no relationship between changes in the sulfate or thiol content and activity and expression of the sulfate transporters. Thus, their significance as regulatory signal compounds remains unresolved. The activity and expression of APS reductase, which was enhanced strongly only in the shoots of sulfate-deprived plants, and rapidly decreased again upon sulfate re-supply, corresponded with changes in thiol content, consistent with this pool having a role as a regulatory signal.

40|$|Short-term {{exposure}} of Brassica oleracea L. (<b>curly</b> <b>kale)</b> to atmospheric H 2 S levels (0. 2 - 0. 8 muL. L- 1), which an sufficient {{to meet the}} plants sulphur requirement, resulted in {{a decrease in the}} activity of adenosine 5 '-phosphosulphate reductase (APR) in the shoot. The reduction in APR activity was maximally 80 % and was already substantial after id exposure to 0. 2 muL. L- 1 H 2 S. The activity of APR in the roots remained unaffected upon exposure to all levels of H 2 S. The activities of ATP-sulphurylase (ATPS), serine acetyltransferase (SAT) and O-acetylserine(thiol) lyase (OAS-TL), in both shoot and roots were not affected upon exposure to H 2 S levels ranging from 0. 2 - 0. 8 muL. L- 1. There was a rapid increase in the shoot thiol content, including cysteine, upon H 2 S exposure and a maximal 3 -fold increase in thiol content occurred after 5 h exposure. In the roots, the thiol content was only slightly increased after 2 d H 2 S exposure. The relationship between the pattern of thiol accumulation and changes in sulphate assimilation upon H 2 S exposure is discussed. (C) 2001 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS...|$|E
40|$|The uptake of {{hydrogen}} sulfide (H 2 S) by shoots of <b>curly</b> <b>kale</b> (Brassica oleracea) showed saturation kinetics {{with respect to}} the atmospheric concentration. The kinetics are largely determined by the rate of metabolism of the absorbed H,S into cysteine, catalyzed by O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase, and can be described by the Michaelis-Menten equation. When B. oleracea was grown under sulfate (SO 42 -) -deprived conditions, plants developed sulfur (S) deficiency symptoms and H,S uptake kinetics were substantially altered. Shoots of SO 42 - -deprived plants had a lower affinity to H 2 S uptake, whereas the maximal H 2 S uptake rate was higher. When SO 42 [...] deprived plants were simultaneously exposed to 0. 2 mul l(- 1) H 2 S all S deficiency symptoms disappeared and H,S uptake kinetics returned rapidly to values observed for S-sufficient shoots. The activity of the H,S-fixating enzyme O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase was hardly affected upon either prolonged H 2 S exposure or SO 42 - deprivation. Evidently, the activity of O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase was not the rate-limiting step in the H 2 S uptake by shoots. The significance of the in situ availability and rate of synthesis of the substrate O-acetylserine for O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase as determining factor in the uptake kinetics of H 2 S needs further evaluation.

40|$|A well-regulated {{nutrient}} uptake is {{of crucial}} importance for every organism. Plants, as sessile organisms have developed different strategies {{to cope with}} environmental changes. Therefore, the uptake of nitrogen and sulfur are regulated in a coordinate manner and adjusted to meet the nutrient requirement for growth. Nitrate and ammonium are the major N forms that plants roots can use as nitrogen source for growth, while sulfate is the major sulfur source. Both nitrate and sulfate uptake are mediated by groups of nitrate and sulfate transporter proteins. The nitrate assimilatory pathway shares various similarities with the sulfate assimilatory pathway. Both nitrate and sulfate have to be reduced prior to assimilation into amino acids, via the GS-GOGAT cycle, and into cysteine, respectively. The synthesis of cysteine {{is one of the}} primary coupling reactions between nitrogen and sulfur metabolism. Atmospheric NH 3 and H 2 S both can be used as reduced nitrogen and sulfur sources. The present thesis was aimed to get more insight into the possible interaction between atmospheric NH 3 and pedospheric nitrate nutrition in plant growth and functioning and the interaction between nitrogen and sulfur assimilation on a whole plant basis (Chapter 1). 	In Chapter 2, a description of the material and methods used in this thesis is presented. 	In Chapters 3 and 4, comparative studies with different cultivars of Brassica oleracea L. were carried out, in order to search for plants differing in nitrogen and sulfur requirement for growth and to establish to what extent glucosinolates can contribute to the total sulfur pool, respectively. In Chapter 3, only minor differences were found in terms of growth and biochemical composition between the cultivars, while in all cultivars, the sulfur was mainly present as sulfate, representing 70 - 88 % of the total sulfur content. In that context, it was suggested that organic sulfur rather than total sulfur is the better parameter to calculate sulfur requirement for growth. The data in Chapter 4 showed that in all cultivars total glucosinolate content was highest in the roots. In addition, the glucosinolate fraction expressed on a total sulfur basis was very low (1 - 2 %) whereas the glucosinolate fraction ranged from 10 - 23 % when expressed on an organic sulfur basis. Therefore, expression on an organic sulfur basis, rather than on a total sulfur basis, appears to be a better parameter to assess the fraction of glucosinolates. Due to the minor differences in growth and biochemical parameters between the cultivars investigated in Chapters 3 and 4, no more comparative experiments were carried out. All further experiments were carried out with one cultivar only, Brassica oleracea L. (<b>curly</b> <b>kale),</b> the cultivar with a relatively low nitrogen content and a relatively high sulfur content. 	In Chapters 5 and 6, atmospheric NH 3 was introduced as a tool to investigate the interaction between foliar N uptake and root nitrate uptake. In Chapter 5, B. oleracea was exposed to 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 µl l- 1 NH 3 during one week and the impact on growth and N compounds was determined. Exposure to NH 3 increased shoot biomass production at 2 and 4 µl l- 1, but resulted in an inhibition of shoot and root growth at 6 and 8 µl l- 1. Shoot total N content was increased at all levels, mainly due to the increase in free amino acids. Even at atmospheric NH 3 levels, at which the foliarly absorbed NH 3 would cover a proportion of the N requirement there was already an increase in the nitrogen content of the shoots and roots. Apparently, there was no direct regulatory control of and/or interaction between atmospheric and pedospheric nitrogen utilization in B. oleracea. Chapter 6 was aimed to establish to what extent NH 3 can contribute to the N budget of the plant or can be regarded as a toxin. B. oleracea was exposed to 0, 4 and 8 µl l- 1 NH 3, with and without nitrate in the nutrient solution. Growth, N compounds, nitrate uptake rate, soluble sugars and cations were measured. In nitrate-sufficient plant biomass production was not affected at 4 µl l- 1 NH 3, but reduced at 8 µl l- 1 NH 3. The measured nitrate uptake rates agreed well with the plant’s N requirement for growth. In nitrate-deprived plants, shoot biomass was increased at both concentrations, but root biomass decreased at 8 µl l- 1 NH 3. The data presented do not support the hypothesis that NH 3 toxicity is caused by a shortage of sugars or a lack of capacity to detoxify NH 3. 	In Chapter 7, seedlings of B. oleracea were exposed to 4 µl l- 1 NH 3, in the absence and presence of nitrate and sulfate in the nutrient solution. Growth, morphological parameters of the root system and nitrate uptake were measured. In the absence of an atmospheric N source, nitrate as well as sulfate deprivation led to an increase in total root length but did not affect root surface area, volume or average diameter. NH 3 exposure in combination with sulfate deprivation resulted in a less branched and thinner root system. NH 3 exposure, which affects the internal N status of the plant, counterbalanced the effect of nitrate deprivation, which led {{to the conclusion that the}} N status of the plant might be important in controlling root length of B. oleracea. Nitrate uptake was expressed on a weight basis and a root length basis. The results show that nitrate uptake is rather independent of the unit of expression. 	In Chapter 8, B. oleracea was exposed to 4 μl l- 1 NH 3 and 0. 15 μl l- 1 H 2 S simultaneously, in the presence and absence of nitrate and sulfate in the nutrient solution, for one week, and growth and biochemical parameters were assessed. Unexposed plants, which were deprived of nitrate or sulfate for a week, became N deficient, but not yet S deficient. In the absence of nitrate and sulfate, combined NH 3 +H 2 S exposure was beneficial for B. oleracea, since the atmospheric N and S sources were used for growth. However, exposure to both atmospheric nutrient sources did not change biomass allocation in favor of the root in the nitrate- and sulfate-deprived plants. Biochemical analysis revealed that nitrogen nutrition, either by nitrate supply to the root or NH 3 exposure to the shoot, mainly affected total N and free amino acid content, whereas sulfate supply to the roots and H 2 S exposure mainly affected total S and thiol content. The lack of correlation between changes in thiol and OAS pools, under different atmospheric conditions, suggests that their role in the coordination between the nitrate and sulfate metabolic pathways is limited. 	In Chapter 9, nutrient requirement for growth and the effects of sulfate deprivation in B oleracea were aspects selected for discussion. In addition, the dual role of atmospheric NH 3, as nutrient and toxin, is discussed...|$|E
