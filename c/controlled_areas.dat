5|$|The {{killings in}} the Slunj pocket, {{including}} those in Saborsko, were prosecuted by the ICTY. The ICTY charged Babić and Milan Martić, respectively the defence and interior ministers of the SAO Krajina, with persecution, extermination and murder of non-Serb civilians in the area as well as deportations and forcible transfer of the civilian population, intentional plunder and destruction of property. Babić was tried at the ICTY in 2003–05, {{convicted and sentenced to}} 13 years in prison. Martić was tried in 2002–08, convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison. His involvement in the killings, among other charges brought forward by the ICTY, was interpreted by the tribunal as part of a campaign of ethnic cleansing of non-Serbs from SAO Krajina <b>controlled</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|E

The next day FAR forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions, but RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back. The RPF then began an attack from the north on three fronts, seeking to link up quickly with the isolated troops in Kigali. Kagame {{refused to talk to}} the interim government, believing that it was just a cover for Bagosora's rule, and not committed to ending {{the genocide}}. Over the next few days, the RPF advanced steadily south, capturing Gabiro and large areas of the countryside to the north and east of Kigali. They avoided attacking Kigali or Byumba, but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes. The RPF also allowed Tutsi refugees from Uganda to settle behind the front line in the RPF <b>controlled</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of middle-class and educated Khmers had grown {{weary of the}} prince and welcomed the change of government. They were joined by the military, for whom {{the prospect of the}} return of American military and financial aid was a cause for celebration. Within days of his deposition, Sihanouk, now in Beijing, broadcast an appeal to the people to resist the usurpers. Demonstrations and riots occurred (mainly in areas contiguous to PAVN/Viet Cong <b>controlled</b> <b>areas),</b> but no nationwide groundswell threatened the government. In one incident at Kampong Cham on 29 March, however, an enraged crowd killed Lon Nol's brother, Lon Nil, tore out his liver, and cooked and ate it.

30|$|The {{development}} of the prediction formula aims at quickly dividing the injection–production <b>control</b> <b>area.</b> In order to validate the feasibility and accuracy of this prediction formula, we apply this prediction formula to predict the ratio of injection–production <b>control</b> <b>area</b> for a synthetic reservoir model. Then the ratio of injection–production <b>control</b> <b>area</b> for a synthetic reservoir model is also calculated by streamline numerical simulator.

40|$|Artículos en revistasThis paper {{investigates the}} {{application}} of adaptive control to the Spanish load-frequency regulation scheme, Automatic Generation Control (AGC). The Spanish AGC system regulates the frequency and the power exchange between France and Spain. The system is hierarchically structured with one master regulator that coordinates four <b>control</b> <b>areas.</b> Each <b>control</b> <b>area</b> is composed of several generating units providing AGC service. Coordinating signals are sent to the <b>control</b> <b>areas</b> so that the global system response achieves the objective established by the System Operator. The participation of each <b>control</b> <b>area</b> in the service is set according to the rated share that it has obtained in the secondary-reserve market and its relative response speed {{compared to that of}} the rest of the <b>control</b> <b>areas.</b> Some problems, such as the lack of sensitivity to the quality of the reserve provided by the <b>control</b> <b>areas,</b> have been detected in the operation of the current AGC scheme. A new design, which is presented in this paper, has been developed in order to overcome these problems. This paper attempts to outline how this new design improves the global AGC system response and the distribution of the regulation effort among the <b>control</b> <b>areas.</b> The proposed strategy is compared with the present design by means of simulation. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
