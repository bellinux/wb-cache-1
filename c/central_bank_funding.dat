Many <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> apply so-called 'fixed rate tender' auctions in their open market operations.

50|$|Just after {{finishing}} graduate school, Kashyap and Jeremy Stein began a long collaboration that examined {{the role of}} banks in transmission of monetary policy. They explored whether central bank open-market operations have special effects because the central bank’s counterparties were banks who require central bank reserves to operate. In traditional analyses, monetary operations that change reserves matter because they affect the amount of deposits that banks can offer and because deposits are a form of money, this changes the volume of transactions in the economy. Kashyap and Stein noted that reserve changes also have implications {{for the other side}} of the banks’ balance sheet. They investigated whether the expansion in loans that comes when bank reserves increase, which they dubbed the “bank lending channel,” had a separate effect on the economy. They first tested this conjecture using aggregate U.S. data in a paper with David Wilcox and found that when the Federal Reserve tightened policy, bank lending fell and the lending reduction caused a drop in spending. Subsequently Kashyap and Stein used bank level data to show that lending by banks that were more dependent on <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>funding</b> was more responsive to central bank policy.|$|E
5000|$|The heavy {{borrowing}} abroad by Irish banks reflected the enormous {{increase in their}} lending into the Irish property market, a lending area which since 1996 seemed {{to be able to}} provide an endless flow of profitable lending opportunities as the Irish public relentlessly bought and sold property. [...] The total stock of mortgage loans in Ireland exploded from €16 billion {{in the first quarter of}} 2003 to a peak of €106 billion by the third quarter of 2008, about 60 percent of Ireland's GDP for that year. [...] This, in turn, led to a massive increase in the price of Irish property assets. The freezing-up of the world's interbank market during the financial crisis of 2007-2008 caused two problems for Irish banks. Firstly, with no new money available to borrow, withdrawal of deposits caused a liquidity problem. In other words, there was no cash available to honour withdrawal requests. A liquidity problem on its own is usually manageable through <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>funding.</b> However, the second problem was solvency and this was much more serious. The lack of new money meant no new loans which meant no new property deals. No new property purchases both exposed the fragile cash-flows of developers and highlighted the stratospheric valuations of property. With the value of most of their assets (loans) declining in line with the property market, the liabilities (deposits) of the six Irish domestic banks were now considerably greater than their assets. Insolvency loomed and Irish banks would need major cash injections (recapitalisation) to stay open.|$|E
5000|$|Like regular banks, shadow banks provide {{credit and}} {{generally}} increase the liquidity {{of the financial}} sector. Yet unlike their more regulated competitors, they lack access to <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>funding</b> or safety nets such as deposit insurance and debt guarantees. [...] In contrast to traditional banks, shadow banks do not take deposits. Instead, they rely on short-term funding provided either by asset-backed commercial paper or by the repo market, in which borrowers in substance offer collateral as security against a cash loan, through the mechanism of selling the security to a lender and agreeing to repurchase it at an agreed {{time in the future}} for an agreed price. Money market funds do not rely on short-term funding; rather, they are investment pools that provide short-term funding by investing in short-term debt instruments issued by banks, corporations, state and local governments, and other borrowers. The shadow banking sector operates across the American, European, and Chinese financial sectors, and in perceived tax havens worldwide. Shadow banks can be involved in the provision of long-term loans like mortgages, facilitating credit across the financial system by matching investors and borrowers individually or by becoming part of a chain involving numerous entities, some of which may be mainstream banks. Due in part to their specialized structure, shadow banks can sometimes provide credit more cost-efficiently than traditional banks. A headline study by the International Monetary Fund defines the two key functions of the shadow banking system as securitization - to create safe assets, and collateral intermediation - to help reduce counterparty risks and facilitate secured transactions. In the US, prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the shadow banking system had overtaken the regular banking system in supplying loans to various types of borrower; including businesses, home and car buyers, students and credit users. As they are often less risk averse than regular banks, entities from the shadow banking system will sometimes provide loans to borrowers who might otherwise be refused credit. Money market funds are considered more risk averse than regular banks and thus lack this risk characteristic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{implications}} of central bank collateral {{requirements for the}} {{monetary policy transmission mechanism}} and the working of the money market have often been neglected. Such implications, however, have clearly manifested {{during the course of the}} 2007 - 2009 crisis. As liquidity was vanishing in the interbank market, banks started to use (and abuse of) <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>funding</b> more intensively, in order to cover their short-term financing needs. As a result, central bank collateral eligibility criteria have become even more relevant than the short-term rate as a factor of monetary policy transmission as well as a driver of liquidity in the interbank market. Thus, in the light of a retrospective analysis of some major events affecting monetary policy in the Euro area in the last two years, this study intends to properly formulate the problem related to the choice of ‘optimal ’ collateral requirements, by illustrating their interrelations with other central bank policy tools and targets. Ultimately, this approach allows us to derive a non-exhaustive set of recommendations for collateral and interest rate policies, as well as for central banks ’ exit strategies from the current unconventional measures...|$|E

Housing financing problems do not only faced by the low income group, but also medium income. Various government initiatives are implemented to help the population, especially for the bumiputera to have their own houses. However, low purchasing power and difficulties in securing financing facilities caused bumiputera cannot afford to own a house at to their eligibility price. Thus, this study is conducted to identify the affordability level of housing financing in Iskandar Malaysia among the bumiputera buyers, determine the factors that influenced financing problems and determined the relationship between the purchase affordability with financing facilities. Data and information are collected through questionnaires and the data gathered then be analyzed by using descriptive analysis (frequency and Likert Scale), Cross Tabulation and Chi Square using SPSS software {{in order to get the}} final result. The findings show that bumiputera in the medium income group can only afford a house below RM 250, 000 with monthly installments below RM 1, 000. The main factors that influenced bumiputera housing financing problems are house prices too high, many restrictions imposed, the monthly installments and interest rates are too high, difficult to provide deposit, insufficient income, high expenditure patterns and housing policies constrain bumiputera to obtain financing. Factors that indicating a significant relationship is gender, marital status, age, employment sector, the number of households, availability of financing, the application process, types of employment, consumption patterns, income, government policy, home prices, monthly instalments, money deposit, loan term and financing costs. In addition, lack of communication channels is also a key factor of financing hard to come by. To overcome this problem, the government should set up a special facility to protect bumiputera rights, control house prices, establish <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>funding</b> to assist bumiputera to own a house.

40|$|<b>Central</b> <b>bank</b> {{money is}} the {{foundation}} of modern monetary and payment systems. <b>Central</b> <b>bank</b> money defines a unit of account; the price at which this money trades determines “monetary policy”; and most payment systems require the transfer of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>funds</b> before a transaction is legally final, or “settled. ” Despite its current ubiquity, the origins of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money have remained obscure, and the present-day system involves a remarkable conceptual leap from earlier coin-based systems.

The villain in our story is the incremental debasement that unsettled the quality of new coins and price of old coins. The protagonists are the Dutch authorities who contended with debasement by regulating the price of coins and by creating “exchange banks, ” the Bank of Amsterdam in particular, to assure the quality of coins.

The more dynamic economic performance attributed to a moderately growing domestic demand and supported the growth of gross fixed capital formation.
