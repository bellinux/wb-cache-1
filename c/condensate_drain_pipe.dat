40|$|In {{new house}} construction, initial {{experiments}} with passive stacks {{have shown that}} there is a potential for significant radon mitigation performance. However, some houses have achieved better mitigation performance than others, and this paper reviews the experience of passive stack failure modes from recent observations of installations of new houses and from previous research on passive stacks. Some builders in the Washington, DC area are required by local code to install passive stacks, and radon mitigators have observed many installation problems. Two basic types of passive stack problems have been found: poor installation and basement depressurization. Installation problems include blockage of the stack pipe, leakage of the stack pipe, stack termination in the attic, leaky sump lids, poorly trapped <b>condensate</b> <b>drains,</b> small stack <b>pipe</b> too small, stack run...|$|R
30|$|Continuous {{movement}} {{of water in}} the pipe and aquifer system collects sediment in the pipes which may affect the performance of the drainage system. For resolving the problem, the provision of filters and envelopes on the <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> has to be adopted. Filter/envelope material is used to filter that surrounds <b>drain</b> <b>pipe,</b> and these are commonly used along with <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> (geo-textile, polypropylene, coconut fiber, polystyrene and foam plastic). The traditional filter material is a combination of gravel and coarse sand.|$|R

50|$|Ceiling {{protection}} switches {{are installed}} in secondary <b>condensate</b> <b>drain</b> pan in split system HVAC applications. The switch has a buoyant component that floats when the secondary <b>condensate</b> <b>drain</b> pan fills {{with water from}} the primary drain pan and shuts down the HVAC system to avoid overflowing. The ceiling protection switch is mainly used in applications where a piece of HVAC equipment is located in an attic or interior space where water damage is likely to occur. The switch does not guarantee the prevention of overflow, but may reduce the amount. Overflow water occurs when the <b>condensate</b> <b>drain</b> line becomes clogged restricting the flow of condensation from the interior to {{the exterior of the}} space. Overflow also occurs when an indoor HVAC coil becomes frozen, which when thaws creates excess water.|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{bacterial}} {{and chemical}} studies {{were conducted on}} Cardinal Creek, flowing through the Ball State University campus from May to December, 1972. Samples were collected from <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> flowing into the stream and also {{from the center of}} the stream between <b>drain</b> <b>pipes.</b> Results of the study show human waste materials are entering Cardinal Creek at the sampling site located behind the Ball State trailer courts. Forty-four percent of the time, ratios of fecal coliforms to fecal streptococci at this site were above 4. 0 indicating human waste contamination. The presence of pathogens in the water is another clue to the quality of the surface water. Salmonella and Shigella are associated with gastro-intestinal diseases that may be spread by ingestion of water contaminated with these bacteria. Salmonella and Shigella were isolated on several occasions from the <b>drain</b> <b>pipe</b> behind the trailer courts. Salmonella paratyphi was found on the December 28 sampling date. It's presence in the creek shows human wastes are entering the stream. Chemical data, collected on December 28, indicate a heavy load of organic matter is entering Cardinal Creek at the Ball State trailer court <b>drain</b> <b>pipe.</b> Of all the sites sampled on this date, highest values for nitrogen and phosphorus and the lowest values for oxygen were found at the trailer court location. In conclusion, data collected in this study shows that water entering Cardinal Creek from the <b>drain</b> <b>pipe</b> located by the Ball State trailer courts, contains human fecal material.

50|$|Although PTACs {{are used}} mostly to heat or cool a single living space using only {{electricity}} (with resistive and/or heat pump heating), there are cooling-only PTACs with external heating through a hydronic heating coil or natural gas heating. Typical PTAC {{heating and cooling}} capacity values range from 2 to 5.5 kilowatts (7,000-19,000 BTU/h) nominal. One characteristic of PTACs is that <b>condensate</b> <b>drain</b> piping is not required because the condensate water extracted from the air by the evaporator coil is drawn by the condenser fan onto the condenser coil surface where it evaporates. Conventional PTACs still require <b>condensate</b> <b>drain</b> piping to be installed.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} columns concealing PVC <b>drain</b> water <b>pipe</b> {{have been}} used widely {{in the construction of}} multi storey buildings. The purpose of the investigation is to study thedeficiencies caused in the strength and load carrying capacity of these columns through experimental and numerical analyses. A total number of 28 columns have been cast and only the appropriate ones which were without defects, have been tested under the axial compressive load. An approximate method of alignment for constructed columns has been developed and the alignment of the alignment of the columns has been carried out before their testing. The study shows these columns have huge reduction in their load carryingcapacities. The investigation showed that concealing <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> inside these columns had significant effects on their strength and mode of failure. Three-dimensional finite element analysis of the above mentioned columns have also been carried out to investigate the effects of <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> on load carrying capacities of the columns. The numerical investigation predicts higher factors of safety than the experimental results. In conculsions, the factors of safety obtained from experimental study shows that, the performance of the columns are in a critical level and could be hazardous to the safety of the building. Therefore, an improved method of positioning the <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> outside the columns as well as the replacement of the PVC pipes by steel has been proposed. ...|$|R
