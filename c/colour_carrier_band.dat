40|$|Objective: To explore {{combined}} acute {{effects of}} frequency shift and compression-expansion on speech recognition, using noiseband vocoder processing. Design: Recognition of vowels and consonants, processed with a noiseband vocoder, {{was measured with}} five normal-hearing subjects, {{between the ages of}} 27 and 35 yr. The speech signal was filtered into 8 or 16 analysis bands and the envelopes were extracted from each <b>band.</b> The <b>carrier</b> noise <b>bands</b> were modulated by the envelopes and resynthesized to produce the processed speech. In the baseline matched condition, the frequency ranges of the corresponding analysis and <b>carrier</b> <b>bands</b> were the same. In the shift only condition, the frequency ranges of the <b>carrier</b> <b>bands</b> were shifted up or down relative to the analysis bands. In the compression and expansion only conditions, the analysis band range was made larger or smaller, respectively, than the <b>carrier</b> <b>band</b> range. By applying the shift to <b>carrier</b> <b>bands</b> and compression or expansion to analysis bands simultaneously, the combined effects of the two spectral distortions on speech recognition were explored. Results: When the spectral distortions of compression-expansion or shift were applied separately, the performance was reduced from the baseline matched condition. However, when the two spectral degradations were applied simultaneously, a compensatory effect was observed; the reduction in performance was smaller for some combinations compared to the reduction observed for each distortion individually. Conclusions: The {{results of the present study}} are consistent with previous vocoder studies with normal-hearing subjects that showed a negative effect of spectral mismatch between analysis and <b>carrier</b> <b>bands</b> on speech recognition. The present results further show that matching the frequency ranges of 1 to 2 kHz, which contain important speech information, can be more beneficial for speech recognition than matching the overall frequency ranges, in certain conditions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIndium Phosphide is a {{material}} of primary relevance {{in the field}} of opto-electronics since it supersedes conventional materials such as AsGa for electron mobility and heat conduction for instance. It is often doped with iron to reduce its conductivity and enhance its light dependent conduction properties. Indium Phosphide is well known for its two <b>carrier</b> <b>band</b> transport conduction mechanism, where both electrons and holes play a significant role. Its transport mechanisms have been heavily investigated, especially in the dark. Light induced charge transport, on the contrary, has beeninvestigated {{at the end of the}} XX th century as far as periodic illumination stemming from beam interference is concerned. More recently, non periodic illumination was tackled. Both have shown the existence of a particular intensity, named the resonance intensity, at which charge transportis enhanced and around which it changes behavior. Both have in common the small modulation hypothesis where ligh intensity is assumed not to deviate too far from its mean value. InP:Fe being a electro-optic material, this resonance mechanism has been shown to be at the heartof a light induced refractive index modulation, leading to light self-focusing. However, a one beam illumination is far from the small modulation hypothesis. Experiments indeed show that the very notion of resonance intensity no longer holds. They also show a behavior-reversal intensity. Itsvalue is different from that of the resonance intensity, but remains to be explained. We attempt here a theoretical study of the two <b>carrier</b> <b>band</b> transport model in InP:Fe, in the simplifying framework of one single space dimension alongside the time dimension. Our originalapproach is to rule out all conventional approximations, aiming to justify each of them mathematically with precise numerical values. Once this is done, we go on to a simplified model of two carrier transport in InP:Fe, for which basic simulation will be undertook and checked against experimentalresults. The mathematical method undertook here is know as multi-scale modeling. It is needed because of the presence of largely varying orders of magnitudes in the parameters of the two <b>carrier</b> <b>band</b> transport model...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} <b>colour</b> <b>carrier</b> {{is required}} by the colour decoder to recreate the colour difference signals. Since the carrier is not transmitted with the video information {{it has to be}} generated locally in the receiver. In order that the phase of this locally generated signal can match the transmitted information, a 10 cycle burst of colour subcarrier is added to the video signal shortly after the line sync pulse, but before the picture information, during the so-called back porch. This colour burst is not actually in phase with the original colour subcarrier, but leads it by 45 degrees on the odd lines and lags it by 45 degrees on the even lines. This swinging burst enables the colour decoder circuitry to distinguish the phase of the R-Y vector which reverses every line.|$|R
