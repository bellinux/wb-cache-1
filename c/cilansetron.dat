40|$|Despite {{significant}} {{advances in}} the recognition of etiological factors and pathological mechanisms, the pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGD) is still not fully understood. Visceral hypersensitivity has been recognized as a characteristic of patients with FGD, especially in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Visceral afferent input is modulated {{by a variety of}} mechanisms, operating between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. Dysfunction of these regulatory mechanisms could distort gastrointestinal perceptions. Recent findings suggest that in the majority of cases of IBS the primary abnormality may be at the periphery with alterations of the motor and secretory sensory activity. Although imaging techniques indicate that there are also differences in cortical activation. Furthermore, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may benefit FGD. Recent pharmacological studies suggest that 5 -HT 3 antagonist such as alosetron and <b>cilansetron,</b> and 5 -HT 4 agonist such as tegaserod and prucalopride may also have a potential use in FGD (Rev Méd Chile 2003; 131 : 85 - 92...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT 3) receptor antagonists in adults with non-constipated irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with non-constipated IBS or IBS-D that compared 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists with placebo or other conventional treatment. Dichotomous symptom data were pooled to obtain the relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for improving global IBS symptoms, abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habits, or stool consistency symptoms after therapy, and adverse events, including constipation. Meta- analysis was performed with Mantel Haenszel method using Revman 5. 3 software. We included 21 RCTs; 16 were high quality (Jadad score ≥ 4). The pooled RR of global IBS symptoms improved by 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists versus placebo or mebeverine was 1. 56 (95 % CI: 1. 43 - 1. 71); alosetron, ramosetron, and <b>cilansetron</b> had similar treatment effects. The pooled RR of abdominal pain relieved by 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists versus placebo was 1. 33 (95 % CI: 1. 26 - 1. 39). The pooled RR showed that 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists improved abnormal bowel habits or stool consistency symptoms (RR = 1. 63, 95 % CI: 1. 33, 1. 99). The pooled RR of adverse events following 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist treatment was 1. 15 (95 % CI: 1. 08, 1. 22). Subgroup analysis indicated that alosetron had {{a high rate of}} adverse effects (RR = 1. 16, 95 % CI: 1. 08, 1. 25); adverse events following ramosetron treatment were not statistically significantly different. 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists were likelier to cause constipation: the pooled RR of constipation developing with 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist versus placebo was 3. 71 (95 % CI: 2. 98 - 4. 61). However, constipation was likelier in patients with non-constipated IBS after taking 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists than in patients with IBS-D only (non-constipated IBS and IBS-D: RR = 5. 28 [95 % CI: 3. 93, 7. 08] vs. IBS-D only 3. 24 [2. 54, 4. 12]).

40|$|The role of 5 -HT {{agents in}} the {{modulation}} of lower gastrointestinal function is discussed. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are of potential benefit in functional gastrointestinal diseases although formal evidence is lacking. Novel pharmacological approaches include 5 -HT 3 antagonists and 5 -HT 4 agonists. These pharmacological classes have shown beneficial effects on a global efficacy end point, and ameliorated more than one symptom of lower gut function in clinical trials. They offer promise {{for the development of}} novel therapies for the treatment and control of irritable bowel syndrome. SUMMARY Serotonin (5 -HT) is a biogenic amine that functions as a neurotransmitter of sensorimotor functions in the digestive tract. This paper addresses the role of 5 -HT {{agents in the}} modula-tion of lower gastrointestinal function. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are of potential benefit in functional gastrointestinal diseases although formal evidence is lacking. Apart from central effects, they may have periph-eral actions, as has been shown with paroxetine in the small bowel and citalopram in the colon. Novel pharmacological approaches include 5 -HT 3 antagonists such as alosetron and <b>cilansetron,</b> and 5 -HT 4 agonists such as tegaserod and pruca-lopride.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to review the {{pathophysiology}} and clinical role of serotonin receptor modulators used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Serotonin is an important monoamine neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the initiation of peristaltic and secretory refl exes, and in modulation of visceral sensations. Several serotonin receptor subtypes have been characterized, of which 5 HT 3, 5 HT 4, and 5 HT 1 b are the most important for GI function. 5 HT 4 agonists (eg, tegaserod) potentiate peristalsis initiated by 5 HT 1 receptor stimulation. 5 HT 4 agonists are therefore useful in constipation predominant form of IBS and in chronic constipation. 5 HT 3 antagonists (Alosetron and <b>Cilansetron)</b> prevent the activation of 5 HT 3 receptors on extrinsic afferent neurons and can decrease the visceral pain associated with IBS. These agents also retard small intestinal and colonic transit, and are therefore useful in diarrhea-predominant IBS. Tegaserod has been demonstrated in several randomized, placebo controlled trials to relieve global IBS symptoms as well as individual symptoms of abdominal discomfort, number of bowel movements and stool consistency. Several randomized, controlled trials have shown that alosetron relieves pain, improves bowel function, and provides global symptom improvement in women with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. However, ischemic colitis and severe complications of constipation have been major concerns leading to voluntary withdrawal of Alosetron from the market followed by remarketing with a comprehensive risk management program...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is a common, chronic disorder, {{characterized by}} abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating and altered bowel habit. AIM: To conduct a systematic evidence-based review of pharmacological therapies currently used, or in clinical development, {{for the treatment}} of IBS in Europe. The safety and tolerability of these therapies are the subject of an accompanying review. METHODS: A literature search was completed for randomized controlled studies which included adult patients with IBS and an active or placebo control, assessed IBS symptoms, and were published in English between January 1980 and June 2005. The level of evidence for efficacy was graded according {{to the quality of the}} trial design and the study outcome. RESULTS: There is some evidence for improvement of individual IBS symptoms with antidiarrhoeals (diarrhoea), antispasmodics (abdominal pain/discomfort), bulking agents (constipation), tricyclic antidepressants (abdominal pain/discomfort) and behavioural therapy. In contrast, there is strong evidence for the improvement of global IBS symptoms with two new serotonergic agents: the 5 -HT 4 selective agonist tegaserod (IBS with constipation) and the 5 -HT 3 antagonist alosetron (IBS with diarrhoea). Further data are required for the 5 -HT 3 antagonist, <b>cilansetron,</b> and the mixed 5 -HT 3 antagonist/ 5 -HT 4 agonist renzapride before their utility in IBS can be appraised. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence for the efficacy, safety and tolerability of therapies currently available in Europe {{for the treatment of}} IBS. Overall, there is an absence of pharmacological agents licensed specifically for the treatment of IBS subtypes, and new agents are awaited in Europe that will allow changes in clinical practice to focus on and improve global IBS symptoms. status: publishe...|$|E
