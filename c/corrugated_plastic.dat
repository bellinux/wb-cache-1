5|$|Although superficially {{the market}} {{remained}} little {{changed in the}} decades following the 1930s redevelopment, by the 1960s it was falling into disrepair, and it no longer met modern hygiene regulations. A lack of funds delayed improvement works, and renovation works did not begin until February 1976. Hot and cold running water and refrigeration were provided to those stalls handling food, {{and many of the}} stalls were converted into lockable units. New electrical mains cables were installed throughout the market, the site was resurfaced, and the elegant but ageing 19thcentury lavatories were demolished. Aside from the demolition of the Victorian toilets, the only significant visible alteration was the addition of <b>corrugated</b> <b>plastic</b> covers over the walkways between the stalls. Although competition from supermarkets was by this time affecting shopping patterns, and the decline of market gardening meant a virtual end to stall-holders selling their own produce, the market survived competitive pressures. Many stalls diversified into specialist foods, clothing and other goods and the high number of stalls allowed the market to sell a range of goods as great as that provided by the supermarkets.|$|E

5000|$|Single-stream (also {{known as}} “fully commingled” or [...] "single-sort") {{recycling}} {{refers to a}} system in which all paper fibers, plastics, metals, and other containers are mixed in a collection truck, instead of being sorted by the depositor into separate commodities (newspaper, paperboard, <b>corrugated</b> fiberboard, <b>plastic,</b> glass, etc.) and handled separately throughout the collection process. In single-stream, both the collection and processing systems are designed to handle this fully commingled mixture of recyclables, with materials being separated for reuse at a materials recovery facility (MRF). The single-stream option replaces the dual-stream option, which is where people separate certain recyclable materials and place them in separate containers for collection.|$|R

30|$|Informal {{settlements}} {{refer to}} settlements that fall {{outside of the}} government’s planning processes. Unlike formal settlements, which are characterized by formal site planning and service infrastructure, informal areas are entirely unplanned and {{have little or no}} infrastructure. As used in South Africa, the term is analogous to shanty towns. Informal settlements are technically illegal, but residents are protected by legislation granting them de facto tenure rights by virtue of living on the land. They have tended to be unserviced spaces, but where they are located on government-owned land, the authorities increasingly provide basic services, including communal toilets and water taps, and refuse collection from communal tips. Informal dwellings tend to be rudimentary, makeshift structures, and are often built using combinations of <b>corrugated</b> iron, <b>plastic,</b> and wood.|$|R

In the metalworking and leather industries, the process is known as clicking and the machine may be referred to as a clicking machine. When a dinking die or dinking machine is used, the process is known as dinking. Commonly produced items using this process include gaskets, labels, corrugated boxes, and envelopes.|$|R
30|$|Despite a {{large number}} of {{livestock}} farms exposed to tephra fall, few problems were reported. Direct exposure to tephra was minimal as livestock are mostly kept indoors and tephra did not contaminate the covered feeding stalls or water troughs. Impacts were largely limited to forage crops (see section above) and instances where large clasts penetrated <b>plastic</b> <b>corrugated</b> roofs spooking livestock. A total of 207 lightly constructed cowsheds and forage warehouses were either damaged or collapsed under the weight of tephra (Department of Agricultural Policy and Fisheries of Miyazaki Prefecture, 2011).|$|R
50|$|<b>Corrugated</b> <b>plastic</b> {{planes are}} simpler {{alternative}} to the traditional balsa wood based R.C. aircraft {{for a variety of}} situations. Most of the SPAD airplanes do not use balsa which saves considerable cost. They withstand crashes better than balsa counterparts because of their resilience and hence are a good choice for beginners. Good trainer planes and gliders can be made from SPADs. SPAD modelers make equally good advanced planes that can be made with <b>corrugated</b> <b>plastic.</b> They include: RC Airplane Combat, 3D Flying, and are preferred in places where the flyers would normally not risk a more expensive plane and yet want the same flying characteristics of balsa planes.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of a series of parallel plate tests and finite element simulations those tests conducted on <b>corrugated</b> HDPE <b>plastic</b> pipe to investigate the role of material and geometry on the behavior of the pipe during the test. Specifically, the work considers parallel plate tests on 1500 mm (60 in.) diameter pipe, and finite element simulation of 450 mm, 750 mm, and 1500 mm (18 in., 30 in. and 60 in.) diameter pipe. It is demonstrated that the applied strain demands in a parallel plate test are largely independent of the loading rate in the test, although the stiffness at 5 % deflection and the peak load are strongly rate dependent. The tests and analyses show that the deflection at peak load in the parallel plate test is imperfection sensitive. Further, investigation of strain demands around the profile indicates that the pipe material must carry local strains in excess of those typically assumed to occur in the parallel plate test...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{interaction}} of <b>corrugated</b> and <b>plastic</b> materials with pathogenic and spoiling microorganisms frequently associated to fresh produce. The effect of the two packaging materials on the survival during the storage of microorganisms belonging to the species Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Aspergillus flavus was studied through traditional plate counting and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results obtained showed that cardboard materials, if correctly stored, reduced the potential of packaging to cross-contaminate food due to a faster viability loss by spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms compared to the plastic ones. In fact, the cell loads of the pathogenic species considered decreased over time independently on the inoculation level and packaging material used. However, the superficial viability losses were significantly faster in cardboard compared to plastic materials. The same behavior was observed for the spoilage microorganisms considered. The SEM microphotographs indicate that the reduction of superficial contamination on cardboard surfaces {{was due to the}} entrapping of the microbial cells within the fibers and the pores of this material. In addition, SEM data showed that the entrapped cells were subjected to more or less rapid lyses, depending on the species, due to the absence of water and nutrients, with the exception of molds. The latter spoilers were able to proliferate inside the cardboard fibers only when the absorption of water was not prevented during the storage. In conclusion, the findings of this work showed the reduction of cross-contamination potential of <b>corrugated</b> compared to <b>plastic</b> packaging materials used in fruit and vegetable sector. However, the findings outlined the importance of hygiene and low humidity during cardboard storage to prevent the mold growth on packaging...|$|R
30|$|With {{regard to}} {{wrapping}} paper and <b>corrugated</b> cardboard and <b>plastic</b> packaging {{from the results}} (Table  4) by model (6), we do not observe a clear substitution relationship emerging as the economic level increases.

The global situation including in recent years supports that in the present study. With regard to the time trend, the regression coefficient is positive and statistically significant, demonstrating the presence of other factors increasing wrapping paper and corrugated cardboard demand, such as merchandise distribution.|$|R
