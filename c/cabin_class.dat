NDL was also the carrying more transatlantic passengers to New York than any other company, due to its dominance in steerage, which consisted mostly of immigrants. In <b>cabin</b> <b>class,</b> it carried only slightly more passengers than the British Cunard Line and White Star Line. 42% of NDL's passenger traffic was to New York, and 15% to other US ports, but only 16.2% eastward-bound from New York.

Before setting course for the open Atlantic, she made stops at three ports where the Italian Line had established passenger terminals to pick up more passengers. She first stopped at the French port of Cannes, then returned to the southeast to Naples on July 18 before making her last stop at Gibraltar on July 20. After leaving Gibraltar, she had a total complement of 1,134 passengers aboard, barely 100 shy of her passenger capacity of 1,241.

She was taken to the Stockholm and subsequently airlifted to Brighton Marine Hospital in Boston, where she died from a fractured cranium without ever regaining consciousness. Carl Watres, a businessman from Manasquan, New Jersey, who was traveling in <b>cabin</b> <b>class</b> aboard the Doria with his wife Lillian, died from a sudden heart attack while en route to New York aboard the Stockholm. Angelina Grego, a 48-year-old, broke her back after falling into one of the lifeboats from the Ile de France.

25|$|President Johnson was redelivered {{to control}} of American President Lines on 2 March 1946. The Maritime Commission {{approved}} {{the sale of}} the ship to Transmar Ltd. of Lisbon and change to Panamanian registry. On 10 January 1947 President Johnson was sold to Tagus Navigational Co. of Panama City, Panama and renamed Santa Cruz. The ship was intended for general trade between Portugal and South American ports in Brazil and Argentina with particular attention to emigrants from Portugal to those countries. General Engineering & Dry Dock Company was contracted to remove all armament and military equipment, convert the troop berthing spaces into spaces for 1,200 steerage passengers, convert the troop ship officer's quarters into space for 134 <b>cabin</b> <b>class</b> passengers and restoration of the public spaces (Social Hall, Tea Room Verandah, Smoking Room and dining) of the ship to civilian levels. Machinery was examined, overhauled and replaced where necessary and the ship's plumbing and electrical systems modified for the rearranged spaces. The work, costing well over $1,000,000 was completed in thirty-eight days. She was chartered to Societa Saicen of Savona, Italy, in 1948 to transport Italian war refugees to South America. The transport was scrapped at Savona on 12 January 1952.|$|E

2500|$|Because it sailed the {{southern}} Atlantic routes, Andrea Doria {{was the first}} ship to feature three outdoor swimming pools, one for each class (first, cabin, and tourist). When fully booked, the ship was capable of accommodating 1,241 passengers in three different classes; 218 in first class, 320 in <b>cabin</b> <b>class,</b> and 703 in tourist class. As was the rule aboard Trans-Atlantic passenger liners, each passenger class was strictly segregated to specific parts of the ship. First class accommodations were located amidships on the upper decks, <b>cabin</b> <b>class</b> accommodations were located just aft of first class, and tourist-class accommodations were divided between the forward- and after-most ends {{of the ship and}} were connected by corridors which ran the full length of the ship. Each class had its own separate dining room, lounges, and social halls, designated areas of open deck space and enclosed promenades, and even their own swimming pools with verandas. In addition, 563 crew members were charged with operating and maintaining the ship. Over US$1 million was spent on artwork and the decor of the cabins and public rooms, including a life-sized statue of Admiral Doria, and many consider the ship to {{have been one of the}} most beautiful ocean liners ever built next to Cunard's two Queens, , , and the French Line's [...]|$|E
2500|$|The first ocean liners were {{designed}} to carry mostly migrants. On-board sanitary conditions were often deplorable and epidemics were frequent. In 1848, maritime laws imposing hygiene rules were adopted and they improved on-board living conditions. Gradually, two distinct classes were developed: the <b>cabin</b> <b>class</b> and the steerage class. The passengers traveling on the former were wealthy passengers and they enjoyed certain comfort in that class. The passengers traveling on the latter {{were members of the}} middle class or the working class. In that class, they were packed in large dormitories. Until the beginning of the 20th century, they did not always have bedsheets and meals. An intermediate class for tourists and members of the middle class gradually appeared. The cabins were then divided into three classes.|$|E

She was put in a normal route from Genoa, calling at Naples, Cannes, Barcelona (or Lisbon), Rio de Janeiro, Santos and Montevideo, to Buenos Aires.

[...] In order to save time in constructing the new vessel, the plans of the Andrea Doria were used but adapted to a somewhat larger design. [...] Several innovations and new safety features were introduced on the new ship, eventually named Leonardo da Vinci. The new safety features included extended watertight bulkheads, lifeboat davits capable of launching lifeboats against a 25 degree list, motorized lifeboats, and separation of the engine rooms into two compartments, with each engine driving its own propeller and capable of powering the ship independently from the other. [...] Other notable features were infrared-heated swimming pools (but only in first class), retractable stabilizer wings, full air-conditioning, and private bathrooms in all cabins in first and <b>cabin</b> <b>class,</b> as well as in 80% of tourist-class cabins.
