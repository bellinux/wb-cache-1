The blades that flatten and thin the casted surface are called doctor blades. These come in different shapes such as thick or thin flat cutting surfaces, rounded edges and knife blade-shaped edges. For tapes that are cast thinner than 50 micrometer, the coating is not applied from the top, but from the side (slot-die <b>coater)</b> or bottom (lip <b>coater</b> and micro gravure <b>coater).</b>|$|E

40|$|Roll to roll {{deposition}} {{systems for}} polymer webs are a special type of vacuum <b>coaters.</b> They contain {{elements of both}} batch <b>coaters</b> and inline <b>coaters.</b> Coils with foils with a length up to 12 km, depending of machine size, can be put into these machines. Afterwards this foil is unwinded and rewinded under vacuum and passes during this procedure one or more deposition zones. In most cases the deposition zones are located around a chilling drum which prevents the foil from getting overheated. In 1933 first time a vacuum deposition was performed on a running web, that time for the deposition of silver onto fabrics. The first application of industrial importance was the metallization of paper for making capacitors (1935). Beginning of the 70 th the deposition of polymer webs for packaging became a mass market. This application together with the capacitors are dominant concerning the market volume of coated material {{up to the present}} time.

Vacuum coated transparent barrier film has been pushed forward during the last years mainly by electron beam evaporation technology with equipment installations in Japan and Europe.

40|$|Plasma {{discharge}} sputter <b>coaters</b> {{have been}} used to create uniform thin layers of practically any target material. For Inertial Confinement Fusion research, a batch of several 1 - 2 mm diameter inertial fusion target shells are grown using several sputter <b>coaters</b> that run for 2 - 3 weeks and use 2 - 3 targets per gun. As the targets are consumed, a well documented ring or "race track" indentation develops on the target surface. The changing geometry of the target has been shown to affect the operating parameters of the sputter gun, as well as the quality of the deposition. Current methods do not achieve the quality and reproducibility that specifications demand. The purpose of this thesis is to characterize the sputtering process as it evolves through the life of a target, to better understand the sputtering process and ultimately to provide the means to produce higher quality, reproducible shells. Several production sputter <b>coaters</b> were automated to provide enhanced control and process data as a function of time. An experiment was then conducted that documented the deposition from an unused copper target through 90 % of its initial thickness in three separate runs. It was found that the sputter yield matches with the empirical calculation, and is determined by the cathode voltage. The distribution of coated material for small theta; retains the cosine to the fourth power dependence, even as the sputter yield decreases with increasing target erosion. As the target erodes, the sputtered material is focused around small theta; because of changing target geometry and resputtering...|$|R
