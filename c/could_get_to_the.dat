5|$|Twilight confronts Discord, {{accusing him}} of {{cheating}} since he destroyed the labyrinth before they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of the game. However, Discord counters this by reminding her that, while he had hinted at where the Elements were, he never said anything about them being in the labyrinth. As he disappears and teases the ponies with another storm of chocolate rain, Twilight realizes that a line from Discord's riddle actually refers to Ponyville itself.|$|E

Soon after, Fred traveled to Alaska and the Yukon to prospect in the Klondike Gold Rush, taking with him his eldest son Roderick, who was then 12 years old. On hearing of the Spanish–American War, Burnham rushed home to volunteer his services, but the war had ended before he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fighting. Burnham returned to the Klondike having played no part in the war. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt regretted this as much as Burnham and paid him a great tribute in his book.|$|E

25|$|Pickett {{crossed the}} ford just {{as some of}} Munford's cavalrymen were falling back with Kellogg's brigade {{pressing}} them closely. Pickett appealed to his cavalrymen {{to hold back the}} Union attackers long enough so he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front. A small group of the Confederate cavalrymen, led by Captain James Breckinridge who was killed, charged the advancing Union soldiers, giving Pickett enough time to pass using the horse's head and neck as a shield. Getting to the ford a little later than Pickett, Fitzhugh Lee was unable to cross as Kellogg's men had occupied Ford's Road by that time. Lee then tried to attack the roadblock with Rosser's reserve division but they failed to breach the Union line. So Lee deployed the division north of Hatcher's Run {{in an effort to keep}} the Union force from using Ford's Road to reach the South Side Railroad.|$|E
500|$|In December 2001, Moore further {{explained}} his opposition, citing how a reader {{can take the}} time to absorb the character backgrounds, by having the option of turning back the pages so that they can connect elements they had just read to past elements, but that film forces you to watch the story at 24 frames per second. Moore's opposition to the film adaptation crystallized after the 2003 film version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was released, and he intends to give any resulting royalties from Watchmen to the comic's artist, Dave Gibbons. In Moore’s opinion, Hayter’s script was the closest anyone <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original comic, but added {{that he would not be}} going to see the film when completed. Moore said, [...] "My book is a comic book. Not a movie, not a novel. A comic book. It's been made in a certain way, and designed to be read a certain way: in an armchair, nice and cozy next to a fire, with a steaming cup of coffee." ...|$|E

In 2000, it ranked number 43 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs in Rock and Roll and number 96 on VH1's 100 Greatest Dance Songs, being the oldest {{song in the}} latter ranking. The same year it was chosen by National Public Radio {{as one of the}} 100 most {{influential}} songs of the 20th century. A central scene in the 2004 biopic Ray features the improvisation of the song performed by Jamie Foxx, who won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Charles. For its historical, artistic, and cultural significance, the Library of Congress added it to the U.S. National Recording Registry in 2002. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame featured it as one of 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll in 2007.|$|E

He claimed that the [...] "complexity and passion" [...] of the concert could be appreciated by any music fan, but urged even mild fans of the source material to immediately buy the album. He praised the album's production values, saying that it was the closest a listener <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> live performances from their home. Joe Hammond of Video Game Music Online also enthusiastically praised the album, declaring it not only the best album Merregnon Studios had ever produced but also [...] "one of the best video game music albums ever made". He noted both the complexity and quality of the arrangements, calling them out as superior to the ones in Symphonic Fantasies and Symphonic Odysseys due to their narrow focus, as well as the [...] "world class" [...] performance of the London Symphony Orchestra on the recording. Classic FM noted the album as a [...] "spectacular arrangement" [...] that they compared to the best of film music while naming it their album of the week.

2500|$|Originally {{the game}} was to be more open world based, with the {{possibility}} that each NPC {{could turn into a}} Thing at any moment completely randomized. Curtis also hoped the player <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of the game with many, perhaps all, of the NPCs still alive. However, this kind of open-endedness proved impossible to implement, with Curtis, pointing out [...] "it was of course very naïve as it caused huge problems with the squad command menu and dynamically balancing the encounters and resources required for the NPC." [...] Ultimately, NPC characters were scripted to change into Things at specific points, irrespective of the player's actions. This led to a much criticized aspect of the game; the player can test an NPC to find he is human only for him to change into a Thing mere second later. Programmer Diarmid Campbell explains ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in 1981, Faulkner {{discovered}} {{a book about}} neuro-linguistic programming called The Structure of Magic I: A Book About Language and Therapy by Richard Bandler and John Grinder. The book's methodology described ways of affecting immediate and positive life changes by reprogramming speech, movement and thought patterns. That moment was a major turning point for Faulkner, as he understood that [...] "if you <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> root of the crucial relationship between language and beliefs, then you could change everything." [...] Upon the realization that Bandler and Grinder were developing innovations in areas where Northwestern University had not yet [...] "cracked the code," [...] Faulkner decided to forgo the pursuit of his degree and, instead, dive headfirst into NLP training. By 1987, he was a certified NLP trainer. Today, Faulkner describes Grinder and Bandler as having been at least 10 years ahead of their time.|$|E
2500|$|During the Great Depression, highway {{construction}} {{slowed down}} with decreased gas tax and property tax revenues. License plate fees {{were sent to}} the counties for road funding starting in 1932 and road crews made of [...] "reliefers". The federal aid money was split between the highway department and the welfare department. The county welfare agencies supplied workers on road construction projects across the state. Roadside parks and travel information centers debuted in the 1930s as well.

2500|$|Busch {{took over}} the No. 97 {{full-time}} in 2001, and ran for Rookie of the Year honors. After John Deere left the team, the No. 97 began the 2001 season unsponsored. After the team signed Rubbermaid to a multi-year contract later in the spring, Busch scored three Top 5's and six Top 10 finishes that year. He and Dale Earnhardt made contact in the 2001 Daytona 500 on lap 85. Earnhardt promptly flipped Busch the bird at 185mph or as described by lap-by-lap commentator Mike Joy in the Fox Sports booth, he simply was telling him [...] "Kurt, you're number one." [...] To this day, Busch recalls this as {{the only time he}} encountered Earnhardt on the track (it was also the last time he and Earnhardt competed in the same race as a result of Earnhardt's fatal crash on the last lap). Busch finished with 27th in the point standings and runner-up for the Rookie of the Year honor's, and earned more than $2 million in winnings. Busch's best finish was third at the spring Talladega race, which was three weeks after scoring his first career Top 5 finish at Texas (fourth), and he added a fifth-place in the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis. He also won the pole for the Southern 500 at Darlington, where he led 74 laps before a late-race brush with the wall took him to the garage. A month later, he led 38 laps at Martinsville before contact with Ricky Rudd cut his left-rear tire; heavy traffic behind him made matters worse, as Busch had to complete a lap and a half before he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pits.
