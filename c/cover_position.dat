According to Stockert, an examination of U.S. records by Mr. Hirst indicates that Lützow's Me262 crashed near Schrobenhausen. The USAAF flew three attacks against the oil terminals at Schrobenhausen, south of Neuburg an der Donau, that day. On their second mission, 22 B-26 bombers escorted by 16 Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft, were just beginning their bomb run at 3:25pm, when they came under attack by four Me262s. Two P-47s came diving down from their top <b>cover</b> <b>position</b> {{to fend off the}} attacking jets. In this account, one Me262 pilot noticed {{that he was about to}} come under attack and attempted to dive away. Unable to recover from this dive, the American pilots observed the Me262 crashing into a small hill. This Me262 may have been piloted by Lützow.|$|E

Hence a final position with only one peg can not be reached: then one of these numbers is one (the position of the peg, one is odd), while the other two numbers are zero, hence even.|$|R

Hope enrolled Popov as a double agent with the codename Scoot (he was later known to his handler as Tricycle), and advised him to cooperate with Jebsen. Once accepted as a double agent, Popov moved to London. His international business activities in an import-export business provided cover for visits to neutral Portugal; its capital, Lisbon, {{was linked to the}} UK by a weekly civilian air service for most of the war. Popov used his <b>cover</b> <b>position</b> to report periodically to his Abwehr handlers in Portugal. Popov fed enough MI6-approved information to the Germans to keep them happy and unaware of his actions, and was well-paid for his services. The assignments given to him were of great value to the British in assessing enemy plans and thinking. His most important deception was convincing the Germans D-Day landings would be in Calais, not Normandy, and was able to report back to MI6 that they fell for this deception, which corroborated Bletchley Park's decryption of Lorenz cipher machine messages. Popov was famous for his playboy lifestyle, while carrying out perilous wartime missions for the British.|$|E
5000|$|The game {{features}} some gameplay {{elements that}} resemble features in other first-person shooters. The heads-up display (HUD) shows the player character's helmet, with a tactical visor. The player acts {{as leader of}} a squad of four elite troops. The squadmate order system allows the player general tactical control over the three non-player characters (NPCs) squadmates that round out the four-man commando team. Many objects in the game environment will highlight when the crosshair is placed over them. The player can then press the use key to issue an order automatically associated with the object; for example, a sealed door may highlight with a synchronized team breach-and-clear command, or a computer console might give have a [...] "slice" [...] (computer hacking) command, while a pile of cargo boxes suitable for a <b>cover</b> <b>position</b> with good vantage may provide a [...] "take up Sniper/Anti-Armor position" [...] command. Where possible, the squadmates will usually take their preferred roles (sniper, demolitions and technical). The player can also order the squad to move to secure any position (wherever the crosshair is pointed), or perform search-and-destroy. Also, there are orders to command the squadmates to group up or spread out according to the player's discretion for the situation.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} two different methods to estimate deforestation under clouds cover. The Prodes (Amazônia Deforestation Estimation Program) method and an alternative method based on distances from deforested areas were tested, evaluated and compared.

The {{results showed that}} independently of the method adopted to estimate deforestation under clouds, the image selection {{is a very important}} step. Errors can be minimized if images can be chosen considering cloud <b>cover</b> <b>position.</b> In the distance method the error can be reduced when clouds is positioned over forest cover. In PRODES estimative the error is minimized when clouds cover is positioned over regions with forest and deforested areas in the same pattern {{of the rest of the}} image. The method based on distance slices reduced the uncertainties comparing to Prodes results, but it adds more steps in the estimative procedures, increasing the operational costs. This method is recommended for studies that require small number of images. Pages: 6695 - 670...|$|E
40|$|In {{the window}} {{approach}} to quasicrystals, the atomic position space E_parallel is embedded {{into a space}} E^n = E_parallel + E_perp. Windows are attached to points of a lattice Lambda ∈ E^n. For standard 5 fold and icosahedral tiling models, the windows are perpendicular projections of dual Voronoi and Delone cells from Lambda. Their cuts by the position space E_parallel mark tiles and atomic positions. In the alternative covering approach, the position space is covered by overlapping copies of a quasi-unit cell which carries a fixed atomic configuration. The covering and window approach to quasicrystals are shown to be dual projects: D- and V- clusters are defined as projections to position space E_parallel of Delone or Voronoi cells. Decagonal V-clusters in the Penrose tiling, related to the decagon covering, and two types of pentagonal D-clusters in the triangle tiling of 5 fold point symmetry with their windows are analyzed. They are linked, <b>cover</b> <b>position</b> space and have definite windows. For functions compatible with the tilings they form domains of definition.

40|$|The {{icosahedral}} adenovirus capsid {{has three}} rotational symmetry axes of different types. The six five-fold, ten three-fold and the fifteen two-fold axes have two superficial points each, altogether 62. The axes {{determine the number}} and location of the identical rotational facet groups and that during the different rotational phases which other regular facets and with what multiplicity shall be covered by them. The number of rotational facets of the five-, three- and two-fold rotational symmetry axes is 4, 6. 66 and 10, respectively. In all the three cases, {{there are two kinds}} of possible arrangements of the facets. During the rotation - when the facets of the facet group placed on one by one to the neighbouring identical facet groups - at the five-fold axes, the facets of the rotational facet group get into <b>cover</b> <b>position</b> 12 times with all the 20 regular capsid facets, 20 times at the three-fold axes, and 30 times at the two-fold axes in a way that a different facet combination (facet hit) falls to every facet, and the original symmetry is not disturbed. After all, this means 240, 400 and 600 facet combinations, i. e. multiplicity in case of five-, three- and two-fold symmetry axes respectively, and these numbers correspond with that of the theoretically possible variations. The same results can be calculated by multiplying the number of real rotations of the capsid bringing the body into itself, i. e. the number 60 with the number of facets contributing to the five-, three- and two-fold rotational phases. The other way of the determination of multiplicity takes into account that all the facet groups of the capsid rotate simultaneously during all the rotational phases, and this multiplies the number of multiplicity with the number of the rotational types five-, three- and two-fold which result in one and the same multiplicity number in the case of five-, three- and two-fold symmetry, alike 1200. Perpendicular to the five-fold symmetry axes with the line of intersection drawn horizontally in the middle along the 6 geodetic ribbon like motifs a regular decagonal intersection forms and the capsid can be cut into two equal parts, in which the polypeptides show a 72 degree rotation from each other, but with a proper rotation the polypeptides get into a congruent position, which means 300 or 600 specific facet combinations. The capsid similar to the icosahedron has also 15 virtual mirror planes which divide the capsid into two, identically arranged halves, forming six right angle triangles on each facet, altogether 120 smaller rectangular so-called Mobius-triangles on the surface. In the three-fold symmetry axis of the facets, these triangles in two separate groups of three can be rotated symmetrically with 120 degrees according to the orientation of the polypeptide subunits in a way that the hexon and other polypeptides too nearly cover each other. Consequently, the adenovirus capsid is a symmetrically arranged body in which several various symmetry types and symmetry systems can be found and their structural symmetry elements exist simultaneously and covering each other. The icosahedral symmetry types and systems are valid and functional simultaneously and in parallel with great multiplicity, but the existence of more than 1500 structural elements in several depth levels, their order of location and distribution make the symmetry of the capsid richer and more complex...|$|E
