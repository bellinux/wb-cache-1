25|$|Misumena vatia is {{a species}} of <b>crab</b> <b>spider</b> with holarctic distribution. In North America, where {{it is the largest}} and best-known flower spider, it is called the {{goldenrod}} <b>crab</b> <b>spider</b> or flower (<b>crab)</b> <b>spider,</b> because it is commonly found hunting in goldenrod sprays in the autumn. Young males in the early summer may be quite small and easily overlooked, but females can grow up to 10mm (excluding legs); males reach 5mm at most.|$|E
25|$|Phidippus clarus {{is found}} in old fields {{throughout}} eastern North America. It lives among flowers, often sharing habitats with the small to medium-sized <b>crab</b> <b>spider</b> Misumena vatia, which waits for prey. P. clarus often waits upside down {{near the top of}} a plant, a position which may be useful for detecting prey and then quickly jumping down before the prey can escape. In a 2002 survey of jumping spiders in Minnesota, P. clarus accounted for 52% of the total found.|$|E
25|$|Any kind {{of animal}} that often visits or {{encounters}} flowers {{is likely to}} be a pollen vector to some extent. For example, a <b>crab</b> <b>spider</b> that stops at one flower for a time and then moves on, might carry pollen incidentally, but most pollen vectors of significant interest are those that routinely visit the flowers for some functional activity. They might feed on pollen, or plant organs, or on plant secretions such as nectar, and carry out acts of pollination on the way. Many plants bear flowers that favour certain types of pollinator over all others. This need not always be an effective strategy, because some flowers that are of such a shape that they favor pollinators that pass by their anthers and stigmata on the way to the nectar, may get robbed by ants that are small enough to bypass the normal channels, or by short-tongued bees that bite through the bases of deep corolla tubes to extract nectar at the end opposite to the anthers and stigma. Some flowers have specialized mechanisms to trap pollinators to increase effectiveness. Other flowers will attract pollinators by odor. For example, bee species such as Euglossa cordata are attracted to orchids this way, and it has been suggested that the bees will become intoxicated during these visits to the orchid flowers, which last up to 90 minutes. However, in general, plants that rely on pollen vectors tend to be adapted to their particular type of vector, for example day-pollinated species tend to be brightly coloured, but if they are pollinated largely by birds or specialist mammals, they tend to be larger and have larger nectar rewards than species that are strictly insect-pollinated. They also tend to spread their rewards over longer periods, having long flowering seasons; their specialist pollinators would be likely to starve if the pollination season were too short.|$|E

50|$|Thomisus is a genus of <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> (family Thomisidae) {{with almost}} 150 species described.

The flower <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> are the species for which the popular name was coined, because of their crab-like motion and their way of holding their front legs in an attitude reminiscent of a crab spreading its claws as a threat.|$|R
500|$|Although Nepenthes {{are most}} famous for {{trapping}} and digesting animals, their pitchers also {{play host to}} {{a large number of}} other organisms (known as infauna). These include fly and midge larvae, spiders (most notably the <b>crab</b> <b>spider</b> Misumenops nepenthicola), mites, ants, and even a species of crab, Geosesarma malayanum. [...] The most common and conspicuous predators found in pitchers are mosquito larvae, which consume large numbers of other larvae during their development. [...] Many of these animals are so specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else, and are referred to as nepenthebionts.|$|E
500|$|Ant-mimicking spiders face several challenges: they {{generally}} develop slimmer abdomens and false [...] "waists" [...] in the cephalothorax {{to mimic the}} three distinct regions (tagmata) of an ant's body; they wave the first pair of legs {{in front of their}} heads to mimic antennae, which spiders lack, and to conceal {{the fact that they have}} eight legs rather than six; they develop large color patches round one pair of eyes to disguise the fact that {{they generally}} have eight simple eyes, while ants have two compound eyes; they cover their bodies with reflective hairs to resemble the shiny bodies of ants. In some spider species, males and females mimic different ant species, as female spiders are usually much larger than males. Ant-mimicking spiders also modify their behavior to resemble that of the target species of ant; for example, many adopt a zig-zag pattern of movement, ant-mimicking jumping spiders avoid jumping, and spiders of the genus Synemosyna walk on the outer edges of leaves in the same way as Pseudomyrmex. Ant-mimicry in many spiders and other arthropods may be for protection from predators that hunt by sight, including birds, lizards and spiders. However, several ant-mimicking spiders prey either on ants or on the ants' [...] "livestock", such as aphids. When at rest, the ant-mimicking <b>crab</b> <b>spider</b> Amyciaea does not closely resemble Oecophylla, but while hunting it imitates the behavior of a dying ant to attract worker ants. After a kill, some ant-mimicking spiders hold their victims between themselves and large groups of ants to avoid being attacked.|$|E

50|$|For example, in the Thomisus spectabilis species, {{the method}} of {{camouflage}} {{is similar to the}} Misumena vatia except the Thomisus spectabilis blend in with their environment while being visible to their prey, but not their predators. This species of <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> are UV reflective while the flower is UV absorbing creating a contrast between the spider and flower {{through the eyes of the}} pollinator. The contrast created greatly attracts pollinators such as honeybees. This evolutionary method of camouflage increased the likelihood the <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> encountered prey, which in turn effects the fitness of the <b>crab</b> <b>spiders.</b> Due to the increased encounter rate of prey the spiders are able to focus energy on reproduction therefore leading to increased fitness in the spiders.

40|$|The {{perception}} of ultraviolet (UV) light by spiders {{has so far}} been only demonstrated in salticids. <b>Crab</b> <b>spiders</b> (Thomisidae) hunt mostly on flowers and need to find appropriate hunting sites. Previous studies have shown that some <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> that reflect UV light use UV contrast to enhance prey capture. The high UV contrast can be obtained either by modulation of body colouration or active selection of appropriate backgrounds for foraging. We show that <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> (Thomisus sp.) hunting on Spathiphyllum plants use chromatic contrast, especially UV contrast, to make themselves attractive to hymenopteran prey. Apart from that, they are able to achieve high UV contrast by active selection of non-UV reflecting surfaces when given a choice of UV-reflecting and non-UV reflecting surfaces in the absence of odour cues. Honeybees (Apis cerana) approached Spathiphyllum plants bearing <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> on which the spiders were high UV-contrast targets with greater frequency than those plants on which the UV-contrast of the spiders was low.
