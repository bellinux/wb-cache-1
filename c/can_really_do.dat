500|$|The show's {{cast and}} crew {{repeatedly}} praised Vincent Kartheiser for his professionalism and ability to bring much to his character. [...] "You can bet the family fortune on this kid, he <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> it," [...] stated director Vern Gillum. Producer Tim Minear described Vincent {{as one of the}} main reasons of their avoidance of giving the character a ghastly send-off as planned before, “We’ve all grown so fond of the character and the actor that we didn’t want do that.” Although fans and critics reception to Kartheiser’s portrayal of the disturbed teen was also very positive, the character and his storylines turned out to be controversial.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} {{international}} alpine skiing classifiers was Mirre Kipfer. [...] She said [...] "Sometimes athletes try to cheat, to hide what they <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>do.</b> [...] They are athletes {{who want to be}} in a class [...] that is more advantageous to for them. [...] In testing and classification they don't show what they <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>do.</b> [...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when you have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. [...] We try to review the classes, but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult. [...] In winter the aim is to have three classes, like sitting, standing and blind: that is certainly the future that we are all looking to." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{described}} by FIRE, [...] "Roger Slatt, Director of the School of Geology and Geophysics, began to unconstitutionally monitor Deming's {{letters to the}} newspaper and include them in three professional evaluations, until directed to stop by OU President David L. Boren. A former US Senator, Boren had stated in a 2001 editorial, [...] "a university {{is a place of}} many diverse viewpoints where free speech is encouraged." [...] In June 2003, Boren wrote to Deming, saying, [...] "I fully agree with you that your political views should not be included as a factor in your post-tenure review." [...] In a July 24, 2003 email, Dean Snow complained that [...] "it is doubly frustrating that President Boren...has shown such sympathy for Deming.", and wrote that he would try to convince Deming's department head to [...] " [...] basically ignore and then marginalize Deming.… As long as we keep our i’s dotted and our t’s crossed, all Deming <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> is make noise and cause a bit more paperwork.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Frontman Kurt Cobain {{was found}} dead in his Seattle home on April 8, 1994, and Nirvana {{subsequently}} disbanded. Grohl received offers to work with various artists; press rumors indicated he might be joining Pearl Jam and he almost accepted a permanent position as drummer in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Ultimately Grohl declined and instead entered Robert Lang Studios in October 1994 to record fifteen of the forty songs he had written. With the exception of a guitar part on [...] "X-Static", played by Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, Dave Grohl played every instrument and sang every vocal on the tracks. [...] "I was supposed to just join another band and be a drummer the rest of my life," [...] Grohl later said. [...] "I thought that I would rather do what no one expected me to do. I enjoy writing music and I enjoy trying to sing, and there's nothing anyone <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> to discourage me." [...] Grohl completed an album's worth of material in five days and handed out cassette copies of the sessions to his friends for feedback.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2013, Beck {{announced}} the expected release {{of two new}} albums for 2014, {{with one of the}} two being an [...] "acoustic" [...] album. The press release for the [...] "acoustic" [...] album (along with the news of his contract with Capitol Records) arrived in October 2013, announcing the title as Morning Phase and giving a February, 2014 release window. The other still-unfinished album would be planned for a later release. In comparing the production of Morning Phase with his previous album, Beck stated that prior to recording Modern Guilt in 2008, he had suffered a serious spinal injury, and that the recording process for Modern Guilt was like [...] "doing it with both hands tied behind your back. It hurt to sing. I'm whispering through half of those vocals." [...] On the other hand, Beck said that Morning Phase was a much more satisfying experience: [...] "Some of the songs on the new record – I get to shout and yell. I'm like, 'Thank you!' I had a lot of ideas and things I'd been wanting to do. This last year and a half, I feel like I <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> them." ...|$|E

5000|$|Proponents of {{this point}} do make distinctions between many {{different}} categories of comparison(s) to Hitler, {{some of which}} are fallacies, {{some of which are}} not, and some of {{which may or may not}} be fallacies. This approach is also critical to strict refusal to acknowledge similarities to the Holocaust, since there were early stages leading up to it and policies today can be comparable to those without being comparable to the [...] "final solution". Advocates of this approach argue that such early stages are those where something <b>can</b> <b>really</b> be <b>done</b> about it, before it is too late. Categories include: ...|$|R

"It depends," [...] says Mr. Franklin, [...] "on {{what the}} boy <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>do.</b> If {{he can see}} the Diamond through the iron safe of the bank at Frizinghall, we shall be troubled with no more visits from the Indians for the present.

60|$|But {{there was}} {{something}} which kept him from falling in love at once with Lady Surrey, {{and that was the}} girl who sat half reclining on a tiger-skin at her feet, with a little sketching tablet on her lap. He could hardly take full stock of the mother because he was so busy looking at the daughter as well. I shall not attempt to describe Lady Gladys Durant; all pretty girls fall under one of some half-dozen heads, and description at best <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> no more than classify them. Lady Gladys belonged to the tall and graceful aristocratic class, and she was a good specimen of the type at seventeen. Not that Harry Vardon {{fell in love with her}} at once; he was really in the pleasing condition of Captain Macheath, too much engaged in looking at two pretty women to be capable even mentally of making a choice between them. Mother and daughter were both almost equally beautiful, each in her own distinct style.|$|E
6000|$|He has an {{advantage}} over Laddie, in that he suffers from no trace of shyness and is perfectly friendly in an instant with any one of every class of life, plunging straight into conversation with some such remark as [...] "Can your Daddy give a war-whoop?" [...] or [...] "Were you ever chased by a bear?" [...] He is a sunny creature but combative sometimes, when he draws down his brows, sets his eyes, his chubby cheeks flush, and his lips go back from his almond-white teeth. [...] "I am Swankie the Berserker," [...] says he, quoting out of his favourite [...] "Erling the Bold," [...] which Daddy reads aloud at bed-time. When he is in this fighting mood he can even drive back Laddie, chiefly because the elder is far too chivalrous to hurt him. If {{you want to see}} what Laddie <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>do,</b> put the small gloves on him and let him go for Daddy. Some of those hurricane rallies of his would stop Daddy grinning if they could get home, and he has to fall back off his stool in order to get away from them.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{these terrible}} rendings asunder never last very long," [...] said Lord Cantrip, [...] "unless a man changes his {{opinions}} altogether. How many quarrels {{and how many}} reconciliations we have lived to see! I remember when Gresham went out of office, {{because he could not}} sit {{in the same room with}} Mr. Mildmay, and yet they became the fastest of political friends. There was a time when Plinlimmon and the Duke could not stable their horses together at all; and don't you remember when Palliser was obliged to give up his hopes of office because he had some bee in his bonnet?" [...] I think, however, that the bee in Mr. Palliser's bonnet to which Lord Cantrip was alluding made its buzzing audible on some subject that was not exactly political. [...] "We shall have you back again before long, I don't doubt. Men who <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> their work are too rare to be left long in the comfort of the benches below the gangway." [...] This was very kindly said, and Phineas was flattered and comforted. He could not, however, make Lord Cantrip understand the whole truth. For him the dream of a life of politics was over for ever. He had tried it, and had succeeded beyond his utmost hopes; but, in spite of his success, the ground had crumbled to pieces beneath his feet, and he knew that he could never recover the niche in the world's gallery which he was now leaving.|$|E

World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity {{for all of us to}} work together to make a difference. This is our time to leave our mark on the world and show that we were here and we care." [...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|R
