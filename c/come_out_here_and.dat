500|$|The team hosted {{an event}} to honor wounded {{veterans}} of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom at Heinz Field. Players signed autographs and held on-field drills with the veterans, while soldiers and Marines spoke of their experiences. Chris Hoke, {{who attended the}} event said, [...] "These {{are the people who}} fight for us to have our freedom and be who we are as Americans. To <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> spend a couple hours with them and hear their stories is unbelievable. There's nothing better than this." ...|$|E
500|$|Kent Hughes {{took to the}} Chairman {{role with}} gusto, {{although}} his relationship with Brundage was never cordial. During a visit to Melbourne in 1955 to inspect the preparations, Brundage was less than impressed with the progress achieved under Kent Hughes's chairmanship and condemned Kent Hughes's apparent lack of concern at the looming deadline for the Games. Not one to take criticism lightly, Kent Hughes {{was quoted as saying}} that he had enough to worry about without having [...] "Chicago blow-ins <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> blow their tops over nothing in particular and annoy everyone in general." ...|$|E
6000|$|Harrington smiled grimly. [...] "So you're the lad who forgets to {{shut the}} pigpen gate, are you? <b>Come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> let me see you. Who is in there with you?" ...|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> {{the whole}} thing went phut. She wrote {{to say that there}} had been a mistake, and then she married.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Yes,' said she; 'that {{little brown}} man who <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at me}} as if he were {{determined}} to know me the next time he saw me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Said {{something}} to her! Why, ma'am, he <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> asked my permission {{to pay his}} addresses to her, which I didn't answer because just at that moment Rachel came in from Farmer Sturt's opposite--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I was {{a nigger}} or an Italian I should <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> sing. I whistle sometimes, but bless you, it's singing I've {{got in my}} mind. Sometimes I think I live for sunsets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you will}} stop, sonny!" [...] exclaimed the man, {{with a sudden}} change of manner. [...] "Hi, Jake! Baldy! <b>Come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> help me manage this young fellow!" [...] he went on, in a louder tone.|$|E
6000|$|Very {{early in}} the morning Captain Burke was aroused by the {{entrance}} of the sailing-master, Mr. Portman, into his state-room. [...] "'Morning, sir," [...] said Mr. Portman. [...] "I want you to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> look at something!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Probably because I didn't {{care whether}} I escaped or not," [...] Felix replied, with a short, bitter laugh. [...] "I stood behind some shrubs {{just inside the}} garden, and watched the hunt go by. Then I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> sat down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When he <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> drank {{tea with}} us that evening," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Ray, [...] "I took a liking to him most unaccountable, {{unless it was}} that I had a foreshadowing {{that he was going}} to be so near and dear to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, Herbert's {{parents have}} both died since he <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and,</b> {{though he was}} distantly related to the Earl of Netherly, {{he was only a}} second cousin, or {{something}} of that kind, and knew nothing about the family; and of course I could not apply to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're getting frightfully modern," [...] she remarked, {{turning and}} waiting for him. [...] "Mrs. Handsell and I ought to have <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> you and uncle ought to have stayed and yawned at one another over the dinner-table." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are not {{prepared}} for it; that is the difficulty. Go and put on your boots, and your cap, and your mittens, and button up your jacket, and <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> go to work with me, and you won't be cold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I oughtn't to {{tell you}} such {{nonsense}} as that; {{and then he said}} that he wanted to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> see you, and--and--and--; it is simply this, that he meant to ask you to be his sweetheart, if I would let him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You seem to {{have fallen}} on your legs, anyhow," [...] Frank remarked. [...] "May I ask if this is your Imperial Highness's sledge. I have learned {{something}} {{of the value of}} furs since I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> that coat of yours is certainly worth a hundred pounds, and this sable rug as much more." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{reputation}} {{among the}} Britons under his command, however, suffered, with one describing {{him as a}} [...] "bloodthirsty man, who, unable to gratify his penchant for murders in his own country, <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> gloats over his victims.” When Garibaldi finally retired to Caprera, Colonel Peard, who was the second son of Admiral Peard, returned to his native county of Cornwall, where he became High Sheriff and Colonel of Volunteers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, father! father!" [...] she cried, [...] "perhaps {{they will}} <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to-morrow, <b>and</b> {{you must get}} me a fishing-line, and we will come and fish all day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{we always}} speak it when together, Rajbullub. I {{thought that he}} might, some day, <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> that he would find it very useful; and I, too, have {{been looking forward to}} returning, for a time, to the home where I was born." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These city fellows {{think they}} kin <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> {{make a fortune}} on a ranch," [...] he growled. [...] "But after they've owned a place {{a year or two}} they find it ain't so easy. A man has got to hustle like all git-out to make a living." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I don’t {{think you}} will,’ replied Chevenix. ‘When I agreed to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> do sentry-go, {{it was on}} one condition, Master Ronald: don’t you forget that! Military discipline, my boy! Our beat is this path close about the house. Down, Towzer! good boy, good boy—gently, then!’ he went on, caressing his confounded monster.|$|E
6000|$|... "He was {{a sensational}} preacher in Brooklyn {{a few years}} ago, but a {{hemorrhage}} in the pulpit cut short {{his career in the}} East. He <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> got better, but his wife, who had a weak heart, couldn't stand the altitude. She died--a sacrifice to her husband. He's the kind of a man who demands sacrifice. After his wife's death, he fairly lived at the Lambert cottage, and is now in full control. The girl's will is so weakened that she is but a puppet in the grasp of his powerful personality." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nasmyth smiled, {{though there}} was just a trace of darker colour in his face. [...] "Well," [...] he replied, [...] "one can get tolerably long credit from most of the Bush stores, and Clipton has let me have {{provisions}} for the boys on quite reasonable terms. Besides, as it happens, there is money in the family. There was a time when one might have considered it almost the duty of certain relatives of mine to give me a lift, but I didn't offer them the opportunity. I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> set about driving cows and chopping trees instead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, such English as I do; {{but that}} is not as the white sahibs speak it. We who have learned it speak the right word, but not in the right way. I have seen young white ladies, when they first <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>came</b> to the house of your mother, {{sometimes}} smile and scarcely understand what I said to them. It is not like that that you must talk English--good enough for an ayah, not good enough for a sahib--so we have decided, Sufder, Ramdass and I, that you must go down to Bombay, and learn to talk proper English.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess that's about so. If a man's got anything, on his mind, a big {{railroad}} depot's {{the place}} for him. But you're run down. You ought to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> take a hand, and be a man amongst men." [...] Kinney talked partly for quantity, and partly for pure, indefinite good feeling.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mighty {{funny to}} <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> {{do a little}} of this. But {{if you had to}} come here and do it all the while, you wouldn't look so white and soft in the hands," [...] Grant said as they moved on to another pile. [...] "Give me that fork. You'll be spoiling your fine clothes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} will," [...] replied Chevenix. [...] "When I agreed to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> do sentry-go, {{it was on}} one condition, Master Ronald: don't you forget that! Military discipline, my boy! Our beat is this path close about the house. Down, Towzer! good boy, good boy--gently, then!" [...] he went on, caressing his confounded monster.|$|E
6000|$|... "Has he even a more {{handsome}} person? I {{could point}} to a dozen men between <b>here</b> <b>and</b> the railroad, whose clean, self-denying life has set a stamp on them that Gregory will never wear. To descend to perhaps the lowest point of all, has he more money? We know he wasted what he had--probably in indulgence--and there is a mortgage on his farm. Has he any sense of honour? He let Sally believe {{he was in love}} with her before you even <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> of late, while he still claimed you, he has gone back to her. Can't you get away from your point of view, and realise what kind of man he is?" ...|$|R
40|$|This item {{includes}} {{a segment of}} an a student interview in a Writing Intensive course in Geology & Geophysics at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The interview was conducted in 2014 and in this clip the interviewee is describing reasons for choosing to study geology in Hawaiʻi. Brief excerpt from interview: I just wanted to experience somewhere different. I've been interested in geology before, <b>and</b> I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> the geology program here is amazing, so I decided to enroll. The department and the professors are very humble and very smart and accessible. If you're interested in anything at all, they're very willing to help and very willing to include you in their work...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! why, when I sat {{evening after}} evening with our dear Father, did I not ask him {{on all these}} points much more than I did? He did talk of such things! But I suppose it is partly the impulse given to such studies by the {{tendency}} of present religious thought. Yet ought it {{not to have been}} always put forward at Eton and Oxford that the close study of the text of the Bible is the first duty of a Christian scholar. I never really thought of it till I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> then other occupations crowded upon me, and so {{it was too late to}} make myself a scholar. Alas! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have none," [...] she said, with an {{emphasis}} on the personal pronoun, and a sort of appealing look in her big eyes. [...] "But you should take care of yourself, for her sake. You really must take my rug. Hundreds, oh, thousands of young Englishmen <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> kill themselves their first winter by imprudence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It must be dull work to a redskin {{to be shut}} up like a hog afore it's wrung," [...] {{said the}} youth, drawing his images from {{familiar}} objects; [...] "and I s'pose you'd be right glad to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> walk about, something like a free and rational crittur.' What do you say, Injin--is sich your desire?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Her brother {{looked at}} her with his eyebrows lifted. [...] "That was not what you said when you first {{proposed}} to me that we should <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> fraternize with our relatives. You said that it was the prompting of natural affection; and when I suggested some reasons against it you declared that the voix du sang should go before everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Mr Brandon rode away on {{his good}} horse Albemarle, {{he looked at}} the post of the road gate from which he was lifting the latch by means of the long wooden handle {{arranged}} for the convenience of riders, and said to himself: [...] "John Keswick was a good man, but I don't wonder he <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> shot himself. It is a great pity though that it wasn't his wife who did it, instead of him. That would have been a blessing to all of us. But," [...] he added, contemplatively, as he closed the gate, [...] "the people in this world who ought to blow out their brains, never do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is a nice}} place," [...] said Minnie. [...] "I {{propose that}} you <b>and</b> I <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to-morrow morning <b>and</b> have breakfast, all by ourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{man smiled}} {{somewhat}} bitterly. [...] "I think {{you understand that}} it's a custom of this country not to demand from any man an account of what he may have done before he <b>came</b> <b>out</b> to it. In my particular case it was, however, nothing very discreditable, and I once had my aspirations, or, as you prefer to consider it, I recognized my obligations. Then the blow fell unexpectedly, <b>and</b> I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> became a hired man--a wandering chopper. After all, one learns to be content rather easily, which is in several ways fortunate. Then you instilled fresh aspirations--it's the right word in this case--into me, and I made another attempt, only to be hurled back again. There doesn't {{seem to be much}} use in attempting the impossible." ...|$|R
