5000|$|The {{tung tree}} is valued for tung oil, which {{is derived from}} the seeds of the tree. Tung oil, also called <b>China</b> <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> or nut oil, has {{traditionally}} been used in lamps in China. In modern times, it is used as an ingredient in paint, varnish, and caulk. It is also used as a wood finish for furniture and other wooden objects. After processing to remove gums in the oil, it was also used as a motor fuel. Marco Polo wrote in the 13th century [...] "The Chinese take some lime and chopped hemp, and these they knead together with a certain wood oil; and when the three are thoroughly amalgamated they hold like any glue, and with this mixture they paint their ships".|$|E
5000|$|Tung oil or <b>China</b> <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> is a {{drying oil}} {{obtained}} by pressing the seed from the nut of the tung tree (Vernicia fordii). Tung oil hardens upon exposure to air, {{and the resulting}} coating is transparent and has a deep, almost wet look. Used mostly for finishing/protecting wood, after numerous coats the finish can even look plastic-like. Related drying oils include linseed, safflower, poppy and soybean oils. The oil and its use {{are believed to have}} originated in ancient China and appear in the writings of Confucius from about 400 B.C.Raw tung oil tends to dry to a fine wrinkled finish; the US name for this is gas checking: this property was used to make wrinkle finishes, usually by adding excess cobalt drier. To stop this, the oil is heated to gas-proof it, and most oils used for coating are gas-proofed. Thus, to avoid the wrinkling, all tung oil available for finishing today is [...] "boiled".|$|E

30|$|A {{white paint}} layer, 0.1 – 0.2  mm thick, is noticed {{right on the}} top of the thin blue layer. It is {{composed}} of whitish materials that created the embossed dragon and cloud patterns on golden-dragon Hexi painting. Therefore, the shape and embossed height of patterns determines the white paint layer’s thickness. Raman spectrum of the white color, as shown in Fig.  5 b, demonstrates three instantly noticeable Raman peaks at 284, 717, and 1091  cm− 1, all of which have been confirmed as characteristic of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) [26]. The source of calcium carbonate can be attributable to chalk, a very finely grained limestone deposit. Chalk has been used to paint white for quite a good long time (from Neolithic to modern China), and its application on Neolithic dwellings as well as on modern architecture have been widely reported within and beyond China. In traditional Chinese architecture painting and decoration, chalk is often referred to as baitu (literally translated as white clay, 白土) and used for the preparation of the ground coat layer or for decoration purpose [13]. Textual researches and analytical studies that aim to reconstruct architectural painting and decoration techniques in the Qing period have confirmed that chalk was usually not used alone, but mixed with <b>China</b> <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> (桐油, a drying oil extracted from seeds of tung tree, Vernicia fordii) or sometimes with plant or animal glue instead. Such a practice is the core of lifen tiejin (沥粉贴金, embossed patterning and gilding), a technique during which chalk and drying oils are mixed in a certain ratio and filled into a container (such as pig’s bladder), and then squeezed out for embossing through a small opening [27, 28]. When wet and mixed with <b>China</b> <b>wood</b> <b>oil,</b> chalk is turned into soft paste that can be easily (re)shaped and (re)coated, which is very important for creating embossed patterns (such as the dragon and cloud patterns on golden-dragon Hexi painting). Therefore, while organic materials such as <b>China</b> <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> awaits confirmation in future studies, the identification of chalk in the white paint layer suggests that lifen tiejin might have been used for embossing the dragon and cloud patterns on Hexi painting.|$|E

The oil concentrations were set at 0.1 %, 0.2 %, 0.4 %, 0.8 %, and 1.6 %. The effects on Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus Trouessart were investigated. The sensory evaluations were conducted by seven male perfumerists using the SD method and {{they were asked to}} describe freely their impressions of the scents. These results showed that: (1) all three types of <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> had a significant effect on making D. pteronyssinus inactive at 0.1 % concentration; and (2) the <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> of T. dolabrata evoked refreshing, natural, rich, and intellectual feelings; C. obtusa oil evoked vivacious, rich, and intellectual feelings; and C. taiwanensis evoked refreshing, natural, rich, rough, masculine feelings. According to the test subjects, T. dolabrata evoked “woody” and “earthy” impressions; C. obtusa evoked “woody,” “citrus,” and “pine-resin” impressions; and C. taiwanensis evoked “woody,” “citrus,” and “medical” impressions. Many issues remain to be investigated, but the inclusion of <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> in carpet cleaners offered both good mite control and a pleasant aroma to humans. This study suggests a new potential for using these <b>wood</b> <b>oils.</b>|$|R

The participants were six male university students aged between 21 and 22  years, and the experiment was conducted in an artificial climate chamber with the temperature set at 25  °C and humidity at 60 %. The strength of perceptibility of the stimulus was adjusted from “easily sensed” to “slightly sensed” on average, and the stimulation was administered for a duration of 30  min. After olfactory stimulation by the Taiwan cypress <b>wood</b> <b>oil,</b> the systolic blood pressure of the participants decreased by 6 %, which is considered a meaningful reduction (for comparison, {{the difference between the}} high-normal blood pressure of 130  mmHg and normal blood pressure of 120  mmHg is 8.3 %). Task performance increased on average by 4 %, although this change was not statistically significant. In contrast, in tests using eugenol, a component of the clove oil used in dental disinfectants and rated as “uncomfortable” to smell, olfactory stimulation resulted in an increase in pulse rate of 6 %. In 1994, Miyazaki et al. [36] investigated the effects of the different concentration of Taiwan cypress <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> on blood pressure, pupillary light reflex, and performance. Six female university students aged between 21 and 27  years (mean 22.0  years) participated in this study. To test the perceptibility of the stimulus, three concentrations of Taiwan cypress <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> were established: “weak”, “easily sensed”, and “strong”. The experiment was conducted in a soundproof artificial climate chamber with the temperature, humidity, and illuminance set at 25  °C, 50 %, and 230  lx, respectively. After olfactory stimulation with Taiwan cypress <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> rated as a “strong” smell, the participants’ diastolic blood pressure decreased by 8 % and their maximum constriction acceleration, which reflects autonomic nervous activity, increased by 17 %. There was no significant difference; however, the task performance increased by approximately 10 % on average.|$|R
