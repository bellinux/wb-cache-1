40|$|The {{theory of}} the <b>condenser</b> <b>motor</b> is the {{operation}} of a poly-phase motor on a single-phase source. If we consider the current in one phase of a two-phase motor the IR drop is in phase with the current I and the reactance drop is {{at right angles to}} it. The voltage OB across the phase is the vector sum of these two. Now if a condenser is connected in series with this phase the reactance drop across the condenser will be opposite to that in the winding. The voltage across the condenser is BC and the total voltage across the condenser and the phase in series with it is OC. This is the line voltage. If the other phase of a two-phase motor is connected directly across the line the two phases will have voltages impressed on them which are electrically displaced by the angle BOC. By assigning a proper value to the capacitance of the condenser this angle can be made equal to 90 degrees. The voltage OB, however, will not be equal to the line voltage unless the angle BOA is equal to 45 degrees, that is, the power factor of the phase must be 70. 7 per cent. It is not necessary to design both phases of the motor for the same voltage so that this condition does not present any great difficulty...|$|E
5000|$|Dual {{capacitors}} come in {{a variety}} of sizes, depending on the capacitance (µF), such as 40 plus 5 µF, and also the voltage. A 440 volt capacitor can be used in place of a 370 volt, but not a 370 in place of a 440 volt. The capacitance must stay the same within 5% of its original value. [...] Round cylinder-shaped dual run capacitors are commonly used for air conditioning, to help in the starting of the compressor and the <b>condenser</b> fan <b>motor.</b> [...] An oval dual run capacitor could be used instead of a round capacitor, but the mounting strap should be changed to better fit the oval shape.|$|R
40|$|The HFC-R 134 a and {{hydrocarbon}} refrigerant (HCR) will {{be evaluated}} on the automotive air conditioning (AAC) experimental test rig which completed with the AAC system including the blower, evaporator, <b>condenser,</b> radiator, electric <b>motor,</b> compressor, alternator and {{equipped with the}} simulation room acting (equipped with internal heat load) as the passenger compartment. The electric motor operated as a car’s engine and will drive the compressor simultaneously to the alternator to recharge the battery. The tests have been performed by varying the motor speed; 1000, 2000 and 3000 rpm, temperature set-point; 21 and 230 C, and internal heat loads; 0, 500, 700 and 1000 W. The results of the performance characteristics of the HCR indicate the encouraging enhancement of the AAC system compared to Hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant (HFC-R 134 a) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{cellular}} {{spindle apparatus}} includes the spindle microtubules, associated proteins, which include kinesin and dynein molecular <b>motors,</b> <b>condensed</b> chromosomes, and any centrosomes or asters {{that may be}} present at the spindle poles depending on the cell type. The spindle apparatus is vaguely ellipsoid in cross section and tapers at the ends. In the wide middle portion, known as the spindle midzone, antiparallel microtubules are bundled by kinesins. At the pointed ends, known as spindle poles, microtubules are nucleated by the centrosomes in most animal cells. Acentrosomal or anastral spindles lack centrosomes or asters at the spindle poles, respectively, and occur for example during female meiosis in most animals. In this instance, a Ran GTP gradient is the main regulator of spindle microtubule organization and assembly. In fungi, spindles form between spindle pole bodies embedded in the nuclear envelope, which does not break down during mitosis.|$|R

In this study, these refrigerants will be tested using the experimental rig which simulated the actual cars as a cabin complete with a cooling system component of the actual car that is as the blower, evaporator, <b>condenser,</b> radiators, electric <b>motor,</b> which acts as a vehicle engine, and then the electric motor will operate the compressor using a belt and pulley system, {{as well as to}} the alternator will recharge the battery. The compressor working with the fluids HFC- 134 a and HC- 134 a and has been tested varying the speed in the range 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 rpm. The measurements taken during the one hour experimental periods at 2 -minutes interval times for temperature setpoint of 20 °C with internal heat loads 0, 500, 700 and 1000 W.

40|$|Major energy {{consumer}} of the World Trade Center building is {{the air conditioning}} system and {{it is more than}} 50 % of the total energy consumption. Considering overall energy consumption of the building, air conditioning system plays an important role. This thesis provides a survey of World Trade Center, central air conditioning system and possibility of energy saving through the new technology. Through my preliminary studies it has been observed that condenser water pumps, chilled water pumps and cooling towers in central air conditioning system do not require operating at the design speed all the time. Considering complexity of the central air conditioning system further detailed process studies have to be done to optimize the condenser water and chilled water systems. Equipment of the central air conditioning system is studied here and check the energy saving potential. Established new parameter measuring points of the central air conditioning system includes pressure, temperature and flow measurements. Evaluated periodical logged data, machines designed parameters, related theories & new methodologies and by that mathematical models of the parameters of the main facilities are established. For the electricity powers saving through optimization purpose system operation simulation modules of the central air conditioning system are set up by using the Matlab/Simulink tool. Through the evaluations of simulated test run results concluded central air conditioning system optimization process, and also evaluated the measured building air quality parameters (both existing and simulated test run periods) and confirmed that the building air condition is maintaining according to the international quality standards. Finally, through the analysis to the simulated results, the optimal installation and operation scheme of air conditioning system are proposed. After the research, simulation of the proposed solutions it was observed that the <b>condenser</b> pump <b>motors,</b> chilled water pump motor and cooling towers were operating at a reduced speed at most of the time during the operation(day and night). Research study was successful, and it was established that the installation of extra two 132 kW, 1 lOkW and 40 kW VSDs will enhance the energy performance of the AC system. Also can be introduced and establish a procedure for the daily plant operation. VSD technology is applied here and save energy without effecting building smooth operation. By taking parameters measurements of identified equipments, air conditioning equipments operate in an efficient range. To achieve 3. 5 % reduction in energy consumption, and get 4 % of electricity bill, optimize the flow rates and temperatures of condenser water through pumps, chillers & cooling towers to save energy...|$|R
