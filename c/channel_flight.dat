50|$|On 12 October 1911 Hamel {{made his}} first cross-channel flight when he ferried a new Bleriot {{monoplane}} from Boulogne to Wembley. This {{was the first of}} 21 cross <b>channel</b> <b>flight</b> that he was to make.|$|E
50|$|Blériot's success {{brought about}} an {{immediate}} {{transformation of the}} status of Recherches Aéronautiques Louis Blériot. By the time of the <b>Channel</b> <b>flight,</b> he had spent at least 780,000 francs on his aviation experiments. (To put this figure into context, one of Blériot's skilled mechanics was paid 250 francs a month.) Now this investment began to pay off: orders for copies of the Type XI quickly came, {{and by the end of}} the year, orders for over 100 aircraft had been received, each selling for 10,000 francs.|$|E

50|$|He {{later became}} {{associated}} with Louis Blériot and handled the logistics for Blériot for his cross <b>channel</b> <b>flight</b> ofJuly 25, 1909. He then {{became the first}} person to buy a copy of Blériot's aircraft and also the first pupil at the flying schools which Blériot established, becoming the second person to qualify for an AeCF pilots license through a flight test. (The first licenses were given to prominent aviators without any formal test) He later becoming one of the chief instructors, and also made proving flights of newly produced Blériot aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The <b>channel</b> <b>flight</b> time (delay) of the {{interconnect}} {{is roughly}} 1 ns per 15 cm (6 in) of FR-4 stripline (the propagation velocity {{depends on the}} dielectric and the geometry). Reflections of previous pulses at impedance mismatches die down after a few bounces {{up and down the}} line (i.e. on the order of the flight time). At low bit rates, the echoes die down on their own, and by midpulse, they are not a concern. Impedance matching is neither necessary nor desirable. There are many circuit board types other than FR-4, but usually they are more costly to manufacture.|$|E
5000|$|Its owner, Michelson, {{intended}} {{to try for}} the Cellon prize for an unpowered cross-English <b>Channel</b> <b>flight</b> but the aircraft was seriously damaged by vandals on the cliffs near Dover. [...] He {{could not afford to}} have it repaired and put it up for sale in 1932. The remains were bought by the Bradford and County Gliding Club in April 1933. [...] It seems they wanted it for its instruments and launch rope, for the Phantom was too lightly built for club work. [...] The remains ended up at the Slingsby Aviation works at Kirbymoorside; they were there in 1938 but may have been burned during World War II.|$|E

50|$|In April 1963, {{most of the}} corporation's London - <b>Channel</b> Island <b>flights</b> {{transferred}} back to Heathrow as {{a result}} of the new competitive relationship between BEA and its former associate Jersey Airlines.

50|$|Even {{before the}} <b>channel</b> <b>flight,</b> Anzani was selling more {{powerful}} versions with larger bores: a 120 mm bore, 4.4-litre (269 cu in) variant produced 26 kW (35 hp) and a 135 mm bore, 6.4-litre (390 cu in) engine gave 36 kW (45 hp). These fan engines remained in production {{until at least}} 1913, though there were important improvements. The exhaust valve {{was moved to the}} cylinder head and operated by rockers via push rods, and a mixing chamber was arranged in the crankcase. The 1913 three-cylinder Anzani fan engine had a cylinder separation of 72°, presumably to lighten the counterbalance. By this stage it had its inlet manifold {{at the rear of the}} engine to minimise airflow cooling of the fuel air mixture.|$|E
50|$|As part of {{the merger}} between Sirius and XM Satellite Radio, and the {{subsequent}} reorganization of the services respective channel lineups on November 12, 2008, the old Pulse was replaced by The 90s on 9, bringing a 1990s pop channel back to the Sirius lineup {{for the first time}} since I-90 had signed off. The decision to drop the original Pulse was because the channel ranked ninth in the Sirius ratings, whereas XMs counterpart <b>channel,</b> <b>Flight</b> 26, ranked second. Flight 26 was added to the Sirius lineup and rechristened on both services as the new Pulse, which still lists its calls as X026-FM. The Bridge (which became Led Zeppelin Radio for two months) forced its move from channel 12 to channel 33 (replacing SIRIUS Disorder).|$|E

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is of [...] "canard" [...] configuration, using a large {{horizontal stabilizer}} {{forward of the}} wing {{in a manner similar}} to the Wright brothers' successful Wright Flyer aircraft and powered using pedals to drive a large, two-bladed propeller. The Gossamer Albatross was constructed using a carbon fiber frame, with the ribs of the wings made with expanded polystyrene; the entire structure was then wrapped in a thin, transparent plastic (mylar PET film). The empty mass of the structure was only 71 lb, although the gross mass for the <b>Channel</b> <b>flight</b> was almost 220 lb. To maintain the craft in the air, it was designed with very long, tapering wings (high aspect ratio), like those of a glider, allowing the flight to be undertaken with a minimum of power. In still air, the required power was on the order of , though even mild turbulence made this figure rise rapidly.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} RF <b>channel</b> <b>flight</b> {{characterization}} tests {{are to be}} run, in early March, to benchmark high speed, 16 QAM multi-path performance over the ocean surface. The modulation format being tested is a 16 differential phase, absolute amplitude, two level polar quadrature amplitude modulation. The bit rate is 100 Megabits per second. This transmitted signal will be generated in a burst mode, being on for 40 microseconds once every 40 milliseconds. An aircraft will radiate the RF test signal at 5 different altitudes. The aircraft will make two inward flights at each altitude with vertical and horizontal polarization respectively. Receivers are {{to be placed in}} two different locations using circular antenna polarization. One receiver will be placed at an altitude of 230 feet above the ocean surface, and the other on a boat with the antenna placed just up off of the ocean surface. Data is to be collected over multiple wavelength changes in the difference between the line of sight and the reflected multi-path ray. The real time signal strength variation is to be recorded as well. Analysis of the resulting data will show flat fading and frequency selective fading effects. The test is run over two different days to provide for some variation in sea state conditions. This resulting information will help quantify the effectiveness of this novel modulation scheme for missile telemetry end event data applications...|$|E

50|$|Functional {{associations}} seem {{to decrease}} in strength {{and there are}} fewer mental impositions on the sensory perception of the object. Aspects which are normally filtered out are given equal attention. Therefore, objects are not necessarily conceptualized via their use but rather experienced as a whole. Detailed attention is paid, focussing on certain aspects of an object, a sentence or any other perceptual input in a magnifying way. Clearly the attention process is affected. Only a narrow amount of diverse contents {{the focus of attention}} and fewer objects are perceived. A person may become absorbed by one object, event or process up to the exclusion of everything else, which has been called a train of fantasy and {{has been described as a}} form of tunnel vision where the individual is more aware of an individual element of meaning, emotion etc. There seems to be a certain unity of attention while normally attention relies on multiple <b>channels.</b> <b>Flights</b> of fantasy and dreaming, including perceiving connections and associations of ideas that do not seem accessible in a normal state are often reported.|$|R
