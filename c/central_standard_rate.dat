40|$|Value Added Tax (VAT) <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> Laffer curves are {{estimated}} for the European Union of twenty seven countries (EU 27) {{over the period}} 1995 - 2011, using a twice continuously differentiable VAT revenue quadratic flexible functional form. A business cycle effect on the Laffer curve is found. In recession years, VAT revenue is typically lower, the curve steeper, and the VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> that maximises VAT revenue slightly smaller than previously. These results can be explained with reference {{to changes in the}} composition of consumption and VAT collection enforcement. A countercyclical VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> policy (procyclical fiscal policy), observable in a few countries, not only increases the underlying business cycle volatility but may also result in long-term instability of VAT revenue. In 2011, the maximum VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rates</b> in expansion and recession were respectively 22. 0 and 21. 5 per cent. Most of the EU 27 countries were operating in the non-prohibitive range of the curve; although Portugal, with a VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> of 23 per cent, along with several other countries with similar rates, was already operating in the prohibitive range of the curve. VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rate</b> Laffer curves shifted to the left and maximum VAT <b>standard</b> <b>rates</b> declined during the analysed period. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
