In 1932, the second phase reworked the original concept by overlaying a <b>cross-axis</b> and planting further beds for flowers such as tulips and iris. The third phase of the plan took place in 1939, when the Weddells purchased a large adjacent piece of land on the southern {{side of the house}} down towards the James River. Gillette extensively planted grass and positioned evergreens in an asymmetrical pattern which he believed would demonstrate a romantic mirroring of the rambling architecture of the house. As of 1990, Gillette's original blueprints and notes are preserved in a collection at the Fiske Kimball Fine Arts Library at the University of Virginia. Garden Week tours are held in Virginia House gardens in the spring, attracting thousands of visitors annually.|$|E
500|$|Virginia House is a large, asymmetrical, two-story long {{rectangular}} stone {{building with}} massive sandstone walls, small medieval windows, characterized by two high Dutch gables that {{date to the}} 1620 remodeling of the Thomas Hawkins-era Priory in Warwickshire, England. [...] The adjacent cross-gable roofs and crenelated balustrade over the carriage entrance provide a horizontal <b>cross-axis</b> {{on either side of}} the gabled central bays. Two rear ells of the house project into the garden terrace, one of them containing the two-story cathedral-ceilinged library, and the other a drawing room and the master bedroom wing. Polygonal bays and oriel windows project from the north and south sides with heavy perimeter walls constructed of recycled sandstone. Over a window on the west side of the north elevation of Virginia house is a copy of a coat of arms commemorating the visit of Queen Elizabeth I to the Priory in England in 1572. The original coat of arms is currently on display inside. The leaded-glass, quarrel-paned casement windows widely used in Virginia House also feature authentic crown glass dating from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century salvaged from the English priory. The interior of the property is richly embellished with oak furnishings.|$|E

However, {{it was not long}} before the 20th-century reaction against Victorian attitudes became manifest at the Gallery. From 1928 to 1952 the landing floors of Taylor's entrance hall were relaid with a new series of mosaics by Boris Anrep, who was friendly with the Bloomsbury Group. These mosaics can be read as a satire on 19th-century conventions for the decoration of public buildings, as typified by the Albert Memorial's Frieze of Parnassus. The central mosaic depicting The Awakening of the Muses includes portraits of Virginia Woolf and Greta Garbo, subverting the high moral tone of its Victorian forebears. In place of Christianity's seven virtues, Anrep offered his own set of Modern Virtues, including [...] "Humour" [...] and [...] "Open Mind"; the allegorical figures are again portraits of his contemporaries, including Winston Churchill, Bertrand Russell and T.

Work carried out by NREL, specifically Kelley, suggested that a considerable amount of turbulent energy existed in the v-component (the v-component is parallel to both the plane of the rotor and the Earth). As such, the Sandia method was upgraded such that it included the v-component and w-component. Further upgrades have been performed such that the wind profile exhibits <b>cross-axis</b> correlation (turbulent fluctuations in one component being somehow connected to turbulent fluctuations in another). However, these are not considered in this article.|$|E

50|$|The main {{extent of}} the gardens faces south, with a central axis that rises to a casino, and {{radiating}} side axes that offer glimpses of the lake beyond their ends. The main garden element, which had been purchased on one of Deering and Chalfin's trips before the villa was laid out, was the fountain from the main piazza of Bassano di Sutri, near Viterbo, which Deering and Chalfin were convinced was by Vignola. Rather than displaying it in the central axis, Suarez sited {{it at the end}} of its own <b>cross-axis,</b> not to be discovered until the visitor had penetrated deep into the plan. The design was richly patterned on the ground, with parterres en broderie in the French baroque taste, contrasts of sun and shade, and many slight changes of level to enliven the essentially flat site.|$|E
50|$|The most {{sunny and}} open {{area of the}} gardens is what is {{referred}} to as the Flower Garden located to the southwest of the house. Planted with several varieties of roses, the layout combines rectangular forms with irregular, curved paths and ornamented with one of three latticed gazebos with onion-domed roofs found on the property. Nearby is a subterranean hothouse (heated greenhouse) and brick tool shed that had at one time been connected to a greenhouse which is no longer extant. The other two gazebos center the large gardens on each side of the allée, and are placed directly opposite from each other to imply a <b>cross-axis.</b> The gardens were restored in 1956 by landscape architect Ralph Ellis Gunn, whose sensitive renovations included adding a reservoir to the southeast of the house and fountains to complement the existing gardens.|$|E
50|$|Palazzo Strozzi is {{an example}} of civil {{architecture}} with its rusticated stone, inspired by the Palazzo Medici, but with more harmonious proportions. Unlike the Medici Palace, which was sited on a corner lot, and thus has only two sides, this building, surrounded on all four sides by streets, is a free-standing structure. This introduced a problem new in Renaissance architecture, which, given the newly felt desire for internal symmetry of planning symmetry: how to integrate the <b>cross-axis.</b> The ground plan of Palazzo Strozzi is rigorously symmetrical on its two axes, with clearly differentiated scales of its principal rooms.The palazzo has mullioned paired windows (bifore); the radating voussoirs of the arches increase in length as they rise to the keystone, a detail that was much copied for arched windows set in rustication in the Renaissance revival. Its dominating cornice is typical of the Florentine palaces of the time.|$|E
50|$|Ahmedgarh is {{an example}} of pre-independence town {{planning}}. It was planned as a market town on the model of Lyallpur (Faisalabad) in Pakistan. The planning consisted of a <b>cross-axis</b> of two main avenues along which auctioning, vending and storage of agricultural and agriculture related goods took place. The four quadrants thus formed constituted the residential quarters for the people. The town was enclosed by a 'Fasil', a brick arched wall with only four manned entry points for security. Further, each of the four 'mohallas' are accessed via one of the two gated structures from the main avenues. At the intersection of the two avenues was a public well, which has lately been covered. This is the Gandhi chowk today.The plots abutting the market avenues were 16 feet wide and ranging from 150 to 240 feet in length. All of them had to comply with a fixed design for the facade, which was in the form of three mughal arches, thus forming a regimented colonnade {{on both sides of the}} avenues.

50|$|On July 13, just a {{month after}} the PWA was formed, the agency {{announced}} a $3 million grant to finish work on Columbia Island {{and other parts of the}} Arlington Memorial Bridge project. The CFA and NCPC met in November to decide how to proceed on Columbia Island, which had only one link to Virginia — and that led only to Arlington National Cemetery. On December 4, the agencies announced that PWA money would be used to construct bridges on the north and south ends of the island in anticipation of links with Lee Highway and a new highway the state of Virginia and Arlington County were discussing constructing in the south. (The southern bridge carrying the parkway became known as the Humpback Bridge because it had a slight rise in its center.) To connect to these bridges, completion of the roads on Columbia Island was also needed. These roads were staked out in January 1934, and the CFA and NCPC began discussing whether a new, large traffic circle should be added to the center of the island to replace the bottleneck that a simple <b>cross-axis</b> would be.

50|$|Virginia House {{is set in}} {{carefully}} planned landscape gardens, which contain a diversity of plants and plantings. Virginia Weddell hired the noted landscape architect Charles Gillette in 1927, and over some twenty years he built more than 8 acre of scenic gardens containing close to 1,000 types of ornamental plants—from formal spring displays to wisteria, roses, and sprawling hydrangeas that drape balconies and garden rails.

50|$|Frank Darling, {{a veteran}} park manager with {{experience}} at Coney Island and the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, {{was hired to}} design and run the new park, called Playland. The well-known NYC architectural firm Walker & Gillette and landscape architect Gilmore D. Clarke were commissioned to produce a comprehensive design of both buildings and grounds, making Playland the first planned amusement park in the country. Their asymmetrical beaux arts plan integrated Playland’s three major components. The first component, a swimming park, is defined by a semi-elliptical beach, boardwalk, and arcade. At {{the center of this}} arcade, a Spanish Revival bathhouse and pool terminates the automobile approach along Playland Parkway and its twin towers frame a view of Long Island Sound. The second component, an amusement park, is laid out along an axial landscaped mall at roughly 90 degrees to the Parkway approach. An entrance plaza with central fountain at the beach end of this axis is defined by corner pavilions and anchored by a casino and ice rink building. The axial mall is flanked by colonnades which serve to visually organize the various rides, games, and restaurants on each outboard side. A midway <b>cross-axis</b> terminates in a gate at the large parking lot on its inland end and at a promontory at its waterside end. The main axis terminates in a 100 foot tall Music Tower that now has a performance stage at its base. All original amusement park buildings are in an Art Deco style. The third component, a boating lake, lies beyond the tower. Its boathouse consists of two pavilions symmetrically flanking a central colonnade, facing a terrace and boat dock and the lake. Construction commenced in September 1927 and was completed in six months. The park began operation on May 26, 1928.|$|E

50|$|After {{his capture}} of Miletus in 334 BC, Alexander the Great reconsecrated the oracle and placed its {{administration}} {{in the hands of}} the city, where the priest in charge was annually elected. About 300 BC, Seleucus I Nicator brought the bronze cult image back, and the Milesians began to build a new temple, which, if it had ever been completed, would have been the largest in the Hellenic world. Vitruvius recorded a tradition that the architects were Paeonius of Ephesus, whom Vitruvius credited with the rebuilding of the Temple of Artemis there, and Daphnis of Miletus. The peripteral temple was surrounded by a double file of Ionic columns. With a pronaos of three rows of four columns, the approaching visitor passed through a regularized grove formed of columns. The door usually leading to a cella was replaced by a blank wall with a large upper opening through which one could glimpse the upper part of the naiskos in the inner court (adyton). The entry route lay down either of two long constricted sloping passageways built within the thickness of the walls and giving access to the inner court, still open to the sky but isolated from the world by the high walls of the cella. This was the location of an ancient spring, the naiskos—which was itself a small temple, containing in its own small cella the bronze cult image of the god—and a grove of laurels, sacred to Apollo. The inner walls of the cella were articulated by pilasters standing on a base the height of a man (1.94 m). Turning back again, the visitor saw a monumental staircase that led up to three openings to a room whose roof was supported by two columns on the central <b>cross-axis.</b> The oracular procedure so well documented at Delphi is unknown at Didyma and must be reconstructed on the basis of the temple's construction, but it appears that several features of Delphi were now adopted: a priestess and answers delivered in classical hexameters. At Delphi, nothing was written; at Didyma, inquiries and answers were written; a small structure, the Chresmographion featured in this process; it was meticulously disassembled in the Christian period.|$|E
