40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} redistributive {{effects of the}} Swedish health care {{financing}} system in 1980 and 1990 for four different financial sources: County <b>council</b> <b>taxes,</b> payroll taxes, direct payments oand state grants. The redistributive effects are decomposed into vertical, horizontal and reranking segments {{for each of the}} four financial sources. The data used in this study is based on probability samples of the Swedish population, the Level of Living Survey (LNU) from 1981 and 1991. The paper concludes that the Swedish health care financing system is weakly progressive, although direct payments are regressive. There are some horizontal inequity and reranking, which mainly comes from the county <b>council</b> <b>taxes,</b> since those tax rates vary for each county councils. The implication is that, to some extent, people with equal income are treated unequally. Equity; health care; financing; redistributive effects...|$|R

5|$|Food waste puts a large {{burden on}} the {{finances}} of each household and local councils in the UK; wasted food is estimated to cost each British household £250–£400 per year, accumulating to £15,000–£24,000 over a lifetime. This comes from the total purchasing cost of the food against what is thrown away uneaten. Additionally, households pay for the collection and disposal of food waste by their local council {{in the form of}} <b>council</b> <b>tax.</b> For councils, the cost of food waste comes from its collection and disposal {{as a part of the}} waste stream; this is especially an issue for councils that run separate food waste collections.|$|E

This freedom from tax liability applies not just to charitable trusts, but also to people who donate to them. Individuals who donate via Gift Aid are free from paying tax on that amount, while companies who give gifts to charity can claim tax on the amount back from HM Revenue & Customs.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil parish}} councils were governed by Ely Rural District council from 1894 until 1974.

5|$|The {{leader and}} cabinet model of decision-making, {{adopted by the}} city council under the Local Government Act 2000, is similar to {{national}} government. The council appoints the Leader (usually {{a member of the}} group with the political majority) and he or she appoints up to nine other councillors to serve on the cabinet. The cabinet members, one of whom is appointed Deputy Leader, assume responsibility for different key areas of local governance. The full council meets around ten times a year. There are decisions that only full council can make, these include setting budgets and spending programmes, setting <b>council</b> <b>tax</b> levels and approving major policies and priorities. In addition to the Leader of the Council, the council also appoints the Mayor of Peterborough, the Deputy Mayor, committee chairmen and the chief executive. The cabinet and committees report to, and are accountable to, council.|$|E

Along with the well-known brutality and self-aggrandizement of ghetto police, the horrifying caricature of a competitive society within the whole ghetto is described.|$|R
5|$|The party {{claims that}} by disowning tariffs and {{restrictions}} {{imposed by the}} European Union Customs Union (EUCU) the UK can focus on adopting amicable free trade with the Commonwealth of Nations. The party would further seek to reduce unemployment by limiting the proportion of migrant work imported from EU member states, as well as attempt to lower <b>Council</b> <b>Tax</b> by scrapping the fiscal implications of the union's Landfill Directive. Independence from Europe claims that by abandoning the EU, and thus the cost of membership, the UK's national debt can be cleared. Domestic budgetary policies include the raising of personal allowance to £15,000, broad simplification of both personal and corporate tax and opposition to zero-hours contracts. In addition, the party condones the forced collection of tax from evaders and the nationalisation of private finance initiatives (PFIs).|$|E
5|$|Beneath the GMCA are the ten councils of Greater Manchester's ten {{district}}s, {{which are}} Bolton, Bury, the City of Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, the City of Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan. These district councils {{have the greatest}} powers over public services, and control matters such as <b>council</b> <b>tax,</b> education provision, social housing, libraries and healthcare. Eight of the ten metropolitan boroughs were named after the eight former county boroughs that now compose the largest centres of population and greater historical and political prominence. As an example, the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport is centred on the town of Stockport, a former county borough, but includes other smaller settlements, such as Cheadle, Gatley, and Bramhall. The names {{of two of the}} metropolitan boroughs were given a neutral name because, at the time they were created, there was no agreement on the town to be put forward as the administrative centre and neither had a county borough. These boroughs are Tameside and Trafford, centred on Ashton-under-Lyne and Stretford, respectively, and are named with reference to geographical and historical origins. The lowest formal tier of local government in Greater Manchester are the parish councils, which cover the various civil parishes in Greater Manchester, and have limited powers over upkeep, maintenance and small grants.|$|E
