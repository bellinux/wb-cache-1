5|$|When the two entered Roubaix, Wegmuller {{ran over}} {{a plastic bag}} that flew {{out in front of}} him, which became jammed in his derailleur. Wegmuller was unable to <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> which was crucial for a sprint finish. He got {{assistance}} from his team car to remove the bag, but his gears still would not change. Knowing that a bicycle change would be suicidal to his chances, Wegmuller continued on his damaged bike; Demol continued to draft behind him.|$|E
25|$|The {{coordination}} of various machine elements including leadscrew, slide rest, and <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> was the technological advance {{that allowed the}} invention of the screw-cutting lathe, which was the origin of single-point threading as we know it today.|$|E
25|$|Bicycles {{continued}} to evolve {{to suit the}} varied needs of riders. The derailleur developed in France between 1900 and 1910 among cyclotourists, and was improved over time. Only in the 1930s did European racing organizations allow racers to use gearing; until then {{they were forced to}} use a two-speed bicycle. The rear wheel had a sprocket {{on either side of the}} hub. To <b>change</b> <b>gears,</b> the rider had to stop, remove the wheel, flip it around, and remount the wheel. When racers were allowed to use derailleurs, racing times immediately dropped.|$|E

25|$|In {{the tenth}} stage, the high alps were climbed. Francis Pélissier was riding with an injured knee, but {{together}} with Lucien Buysse, {{he was planning}} to help Henri Pélissier take over the lead from their team mate Bottecchia. Although the race was neutralized on the Vars, Henri Pélissier still won the stage with a large margin to Alavoine and Bottecchia, and took over the lead. The experience of Pélissier helped him: Bottecchia was riding in too big a gear, which Pélissier saw. In order to <b>change</b> <b>gears,</b> Bottecchia would have had to dismount his bicycle, so Pélissier sped away, and Bottecchia could not follow. In the eleventh stage, the Pélissier brothers left all other cyclists behind, with only Bellenger staying within ten minutes. Alavoine had to abandon the race after an accident, which put Bottecchia in second place. At that point, all the stages left were flat stages where it is difficult to win much time, and with an almost 30 minutes lead over his team mate Bottecchia, Pélissier was assured of the victory.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{version of}} the AMX-30 was fitted with Hispano-Suiza's HS-110 diesel engine, located {{in the rear of}} the hull. The [...] engine could be replaced on the field in 45 minutes, and produced , offering the tank a maximum velocity of [...] on roads. The fuel efficient engine, in conjunction with a total fuel capacity of , gave the AMX-30 a maximum road range of up to [...] The engine's drive is taken through a Gravina G.H.B.200C twin-plate centrifugal clutch. The gearbox was an AMX 5-SD-200D, with five forward gears and five reverse gears. This transmission was heavily influenced by that of the German Panther tank and was based on a project which had begun in 1938. The transmission was one of the AMX-30's major faults and caused a variety of mechanical problems, including that the driver would have to manually <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> at specific times, even if the tank was moving over rough terrain. The tank's weight is distributed over five double, aluminum-alloy, rubber-tyred road wheels on either side, propelled on [...] wide tracks. The tank could ford [...] deep water obstacles without preparation, up to [...] with minor preparation, and up to [...] with full preparation. Full preparation for water operations consisted of the addition of a snorkel tube, the installation of blanking plates, carried on the front of the hull, over the engine compartment's air intake louvers, and the installment of infra-red driving equipment, including a searchlight. In 1969 a single special dive training vehicle was adapted, nicknamed the AMX 30 Gloutte (from French faire glouglou, [...] "gurgle"), without engine and tracks, that over a ramp could quickly be lowered into a reservoir by a winch; it was equipped with an escape tube.|$|E

[...] The transmission was a first generation [...] "clutchless" [...] design from the late 1990s, and there have been complaints about its abrupt shifting.|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, Honda {{introduced}} the CB750A to the United States, with the A suffix designating [...] "automatic," [...] for its automatic transmission. Although the 2-speed transmission includes a torque converter typical of an automatic transmission, the transmission {{does not automatically}} <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> for the rider. Each gear is selected by a foot-controlled hydraulic valve/selector (similar in operation to a manual transmission motorcycle). The foot selector controls the application of high pressure oil to a single clutch pack (one clutch for each gear), causing the selected clutch (and gear) to engage. The selected gear remains selected until changed by the rider, or the kickstand is lowered (which shifts the transmission to neutral).|$|E
2500|$|Henry Maudslay, {{who trained}} {{a school of}} machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a {{mechanic}} with superior ability who had been employed at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. He worked as an apprentice in the Royal Gun Foundry of Jan Verbruggen. In 1774 Jan Verbruggen had installed a horizontal boring machine in Woolwich {{which was the first}} industrial size Lathe in the UK. He was hired away by Joseph Bramah for the production of high security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship. [...] Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe. [...] Maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe, which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw. [...] Before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template. [...] The slide rest lathe was called one of history's most important inventions, although not entirely Maudslay's idea, he {{was the first person to}} build a functional lathe using a combination of known innovations of the lead screw, slide rest and <b>change</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|E

It {{could have been a}} little longer, it would have been well served by more character development and it really needed a method {{to tell the story of}} the game.

[...] Speaking of how much MDK2 was influenced by MDK, he explained [...] "I can't even begin to explain the strength of the visual influence that the original MDK has over MDK2. I was very impressed when I first saw MDK and I'm even more impressed after having played it many times. In many ways, in MDK2 we're striving to reach the goal Shiny set with the original by using new and improved technology." [...] Explaining how having three playable characters would affect the gameplay, he said, [...] "The largest impact to the gameplay experience, in our opinion, will be an increased variety to the gameplay.
