40|$|Abstract. Interfaces to {{information}} systems, and the buildings {{in which such}} systems are embedded will typically {{be the result of}} the work {{of a large number of}} different disciplines, potentially ranging from ethnographers to architects. A common language and conceptual framework has the potential for greatly enhancing the effectiveness and ease of cross-disciplinary communication. In this paper we describe some aspects of the notion of design patterns developed by architect Christopher Alexander and colleagues in the 1970 ’s. We briefly show how Alexander-style patterns can be used for analysis and design in some of the disciplines implicated in the creation of successful <b>cooperative</b> <b>buildings</b> — interface design, ergonomic design, functionality design and office design and suggest that pattern languages might be a way of bridging the communication gaps between professions to produce a shared vision of the <b>cooperative</b> <b>building</b> project...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a three-year}} experiment {{to build a}} distributed research group, equipped with state-of-the-art computing facilities, spread over three cities in Australia. Despite the provision of the sorts of facilities to be expected in <b>cooperative</b> <b>buildings,</b> such as high-speed networks and videoconferencing, significant synergy (i. e., closely-coupled collaborations) among the distributed subgroups did not develop. This was not only due {{to the problems of}} distance, but was exacerbated by several political and organizational issues. An important lesson is that successful `cooperative buildings' will depend not just on the technology but also on an appropriate managerial, organizational and political climate in which these resources can be meaningfully exploited. The paper outlines the experiment, discusses why synergies did not emerge, and points to implications for <b>cooperative</b> <b>buildings</b> and design paradigms based on the notion of pattern languages.
