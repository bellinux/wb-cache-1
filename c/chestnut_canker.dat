40|$|Mycoviruses in many {{organism}} including plant pathogenic fungi. They {{are mostly}} spread intracellularly via asexual and sexual {{reproduction of the}} fungi and cause some changes on them. Although many mycoviruses have no clear effect on their hosts, there are also many reports that they cause some phenotypic chances. Especially, they have effect on plant pathogenic fungi by increasing or decreasing their virulence. When they reduce the virulence of the host like in <b>Chestnut</b> <b>canker</b> sample, {{it is possible to}} use them in biological control. In this review, mycoviruses detected on some important fungal pathogens of forest trees both in our country and world were introduced and the studies carried out were summarized...|$|E
40|$|Individual {{nematodes}} {{were isolated}} from American chestnut blight-controlled cankers {{to determine if}} they were carriers of biocontrol (hypovirulent) isolates of the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica. These hypovirulent isolates have a white fungal colony phenotype due to infection by the virus CHV 1. Of 1, 620 individual Aphelenchoides hylurgi isolated, 29. 4 % carried propagules of the blight fungus and 8. 2 % of these yielded white hypovirulent isolates. In attraction and movement tests in Petri plates, A. hylurgi moved 2 cm over 24 hr to mycelial discs of white hypovirulent C. parasitica and pigmented C. parasitica strains in nearly equal numbers. After 2 days of nematode movement to fungal colonies on agar in Petri plates and 21 days of nematode growth, large numbers of A. hylurgi were extracted from both white hypovirulent and pigmented C. parasitica strain colonies. Lower numbers of A. hylurgi were extracted from excised young American chestnut blight cankers that were inoculated with A. hylurgi and incubated for 22 days. A. hylurgi inoculated on the surface of an excised American <b>chestnut</b> <b>canker</b> moved within 24 hr to the small, spore-bearing C. parasitica reproductive structures (stromata) on the canker surface. The results indicate that A. hylurgi {{may play a role in}} the spread of hypovirulence on American chestnut trees...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background 1471 - 2229 - 9 - 51 American {{chestnut}} (Castanea dentata) {{was devastated}} by an exotic pathogen {{in the beginning}} of the twentieth century. This chestnut blight is caused by Cryphonectria parasitica, a fungus that infects stem tissues and kills the trees by girdling them. Because of the great economic and ecological value of this species, significant efforts have been made over the century to combat this disease, but it wasn't until recently that a focused genomics approach was initiated. Prior to the Genomic Tool Development for the Fagaceae project, genomic resources available in public databases for this species were limited to a few hundred ESTs. To identify genes involved in resistance to C. parasitica, we have sequenced the transcriptome from fungal infected and healthy stem tissues collected from blight-sensitive American chestnut and blight-resistant Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima) trees using ultra high throughput pyrosequencing. Results We produced over a million 454 reads, totaling over 250 million bp, from which we generated 40, 039 and 28, 890 unigenes in total from C. mollissima and C. dentata respectively. The functions of the unigenes, from GO annotation, cover a diverse set of molecular functions and biological processes, among which we identified a large number of genes associated with resistance to stresses and response to biotic stimuli. In silico expression analyses showed that many of the stress response unigenes were expressed more in canker tissues versus healthy stem tissues in both American and Chinese chestnut. Comparative analysis also identified genes belonging to different pathways of plant defense against biotic stresses that are differentially expressed in either American or Chinese <b>chestnut</b> <b>canker</b> tissues. Conclusion Our study resulted in the identification of a large set of cDNA unigenes from American chestnut and Chinese chestnut. The ESTs and unigenes from this study constitute an important resource to the scientific community interested in the discovery of genes involved in various biological processes in Chestnut and other species. The identification of many defense-related genes differentially expressed in canker vs. healthy stem in chestnuts provides many new candidate genes for developing resistance to the chestnut blight and for studying pathways involved in responses of trees to necrotrophic pathogens. We also identified several candidate genes that may underline the difference in resistance to Cryphonectria parasitica between American chestnut and Chinese chestnut. </p...|$|E

40|$|Castanea is a {{hardwood}} forest genus of considerable agro-economic importance for both timber and nut production. Chestnuts {{are one of}} the most significant nut crops in the temperate zone. However, this species is threatened by pollution, social factors, economical changes, and two major fungal diseases: ink disease (Phytophthora spp.), and <b>chestnut</b> blight <b>canker</b> (Cryphonectria parasitica). Similar to other wood species, chestnuts are difficult to propagate both generatively by seed and vegetatively by means of grafting or cuttings. Biotechnological methods such as in vitro culture have been developed in the last few years as an alternative to conventional vegetative propagation. Biotechnology plays a very important role not only in the propagation of selected individuals (being used at a commercial level), but also in its short-term preservation, and offers the possibility of preserving the propagated material in the medium-term (cold storage) or long-term using cryopreservation...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of pullullan-like polysaccharides produced as exocellular material by different strains of Cryphonectria parasitica, the fungus responsible for <b>chestnut</b> tree <b>cankers,</b> was investigated with {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) techniques. 13 C, mono- and bidimensional 1 H, and 1 H– 13 C heteronuclear correlated NMR spectra (HSQC and HMBC) were recorded. Advanced analysis of the NMR spectra allowed the main resonance of the atoms in the maltotriose and in the maltotetraose repeat units of pullulan-like polysaccharides from C. parasitica to be recognised with confidence. In all cases investigated, the presence of large amounts of a-(1 - 6) maltotetraose subunits was evidenced, {{in addition to the}} a-(1 - 6) maltotriose subunits, corresponding to the repeating unit of pullulan produced by Aureobasidium pullulans and other fungi.

Cryphonectria hypoviruses function as biological control agents for the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica, and hypovirus-infected C. parasitica strains {{can be used}} to treat infected trees. We used naturally occurring molecular marker polymorphisms to examine the persistence and dissemination of the three genomes of a hypovirus-infected C. parasitica strain, namely, the double-stranded RNA genome of Cryphonectria hypovirus 1 (CHV 1) and the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of its fungal host. The hypovirus-infected strain was experimentally introduced into a blight-infested chestnut coppice forest by treating 73 of 246 <b>chestnut</b> blight <b>cankers.</b> Two years after introduction, the hypovirus had disseminated to 36 % of the untreated cankers and to 35 % of the newly established cankers. Spread of the hypovirus was more frequent within treated sprout clusters than between sprout clusters. Mitochondrial DNA of the introduced fungus also was transferred into the resident C. parasitica population. Concomitant transfer of both the introduced hypovirus and mitochondrial DNA was detected in almost one-half of the treated cankers analyzed. The introduced mitochondrial DNA haplotype also was found in three resident isolates from newly established cankers. The nuclear genome of the introduced strain persisted in the treated cankers but did not spread beyond them...|$|R

5000|$|Hypovirus is {{the only}} genus in the family Hypoviridae. Members of this genus infect fungal {{pathogens}} and reduce their ability to cause disease (hypovirulence). In particular, the virus infects Cryphonectria parasitica, the fungus that causes Chestnut blight, which has enabled infected trees {{to recover from the}} blight. The use of hypovirulence to control blight originated in Europe where the fungal virus spread naturally through populations of European chestnuts. The reduced ability of the fungus to cause disease allowed the European chestnut to regenerate, creating large stands of trees. Hypovirulence has also been found in North America, but has not spread effectively. The [...] "Arner Tree" [...] of Southern Ontario, {{is one of the best}} examples of naturally occurring hypovirulence. It is a mature American chestnut that has recovered from severe infections of <b>chestnut</b> blight. The <b>cankers</b> have healed over and the tree continues to grow vigorously. Scientists have discovered that the chestnut blight remaining on the tree is hypovirulent, although isolates taken from the tree do not have the fungal viruses found in other isolates. Trees inoculated with isolates taken from the Arner tree have shown moderate canker control.|$|R
40|$|Chestnut blight {{is caused}} by the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica and infects American {{chestnut}} trees (Castanea dentata) throughout the United States and Canada. Once a major tree species, American chestnut trees filled Eastern and Midwestern forests. The fungus arrived from Asia with the import of Japanese chestnut trees in the late 19 th century. By 1913, the disease had wiped out enough trees to warrant investigation by the USDA. It was during this initial investigation that scientists discovered that Japanese and Chinese varieties of chestnut showed some resistance to the fungus. Although they showed signs of infection, the trees own defenses kept the disease from becoming fatal. This is likewise the case with many of the hybrid species that have recently been developed. Unfortunately, the American chestnut was not resistant and by 1940, over three and a half billion trees had been lost to the disease. The species continues to survive by pushing up sprouts from the root systems as root and root collar tissue may be unaffected by the fungus. Although sprouts growing from roots in the forest under-story may survive until they reach a few inches in diameter, most are overcome by the blight before they become mature enough to produce nuts. The chestnut blight fungus causes cankers, dieback, and ultimately death of aboveground parts of American <b>Chestnut.</b> Formation of <b>cankers</b> and death of the branches or stems may occur in a single season. Symptoms and Signs The disease first becomes apparent as cankers developing on stems of any size. Cankers expand laterally and may appear brown compared to healthy bark. Cankers may differ in appearance on different chestnut species, i. e. their appearance on rough barked specimens (Fig. 1) may vary from their appearance on the smooth-barked America...|$|R

The first [...] "All-American intercrosses" [...] were planted in Virginia Tech's Martin American Chestnut Planting in Giles County, Virginia, and in Beckley, West Virginia. They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 and 1992. Nine of the trees showed resistance equal to their parents, and four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test. Many ACCF chestnuts have expressed blight resistance equal to or greater than an original blight survivor but so far, only a handful have demonstrated superior, durable blight control. Time will tell if the progeny of these best chestnuts exhibit durable blight resistance in different stress environments.|$|R
