40|$|Carbendazim (methyl 2 -benzimidazolecarbamate) and {{its parent}} {{compound}} benomyl are systemic fungicides that have reproductive and developmental toxicity in male rats. The major objectives {{of this study}} were to determine the ability of carbendazim exposure in utero to alter androgen-dependent development markers in rat offspring and investigate the effects of antiandrogen flutamide on the carbenclazim-mediated reproductive and developmental alterations. Pregnant female rats were treated with 6. 25, 12. 5 or 25 mg/kg carbendazim, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg benomyl, and 0. 6, 2. 5 or 10 mg/kg flutamide by gavage once daily from gestational day 0 to 20. Alternatively, another group of female rats was cotreated with 25 mg/kg carbendazim or 100 mg/kg benomyl and 0. 6, 2. 5, and 10 mg/kg flutamide. The various treatments decreased the survival rates of pups on postnatal day (PND) I and 21. In male offspring, 12. 5 and 25 mg/kg carbendazim increased anogenital distance (AGD), an androgen-dependent marker, on PND 2. Treatment with benomyl also increased AGD. Cotreatment with 25 mg/kg carbendazirn with 0. 6, 2. 5, and 10 mg/kg flutamide blocked the androgenic effect on AGD induced by carbendazim. The androgenic effects of <b>carbendazim</b> <b>and</b> <b>benomyl</b> on AGD were reversible on PND 22 and later. Carbendazim had no effects on other androgen-dependent markers including testis and epididymis malformations, hypospadias, nipple retention, and organ weights of seminal vesicle and levator ani bulbocavernosus muscle on PND 56. Surprisingly, carbendazim antagonized the antiandrogenic effects on these markers induced by flutamide cotreatment. In female offspring, carbendazirn produced synergistic effects on the flutamide cotreatment-mediated increases of organs weights in liver and kidney on PND 56. Carbenazim had no marked effects on female reproductive organs. These findings show that carbendazim exposure in utero displays a transient and weak androgenic effect and reduces flutamide antiandrogenicity in male rats. The fungicide enhances flutamide-mediated liver and kidney weight increases in female rats. The antagonistic and synergistic carbendazim and flutamide interactions in utero warrant further investigations...|$|E
40|$|Pigeonpea wilt {{caused by}} Fusarium udum {{is the most}} {{important}} soil borne disease and a main constraint in boosting the yield. The survey conducted in Southern and Central part of India during Kharif 2013 - 14 and 2014 - 15 indicated, an incidence ranging from 0. 0 to 45. 33 per cent during 2013 - 14 and 0. 0 to 70. 80 per cent during 2014 - 15. Disease occurrence was observed irrespective of cropping system, soil types and least wilt incidence was recorded in improved cultivars (TS- 3 R, Asha) rather than local cultivars. 111 Fusarium isolates were collected to study the cultural, morphological, molecular and pathogenic variability. The virulence profiling of 72 isolates of F. udum on 11 host differentials, resulted in four groups such as avirulent, least virulent, moderately virulent and highly virulent ones. Based on wilt incidence and reaction of F. udum isolates on four pigeonpea host differentials (ICP 2376, C- 11, ICP 8863 and ICP 9174), 67 virulent isolates were categorised into six variants viz., Variant 0, Variant I, Variant II, Variant III, Variant VI and Variant VII. Variant VI and VII are the new variants identified in present study. Under proteomic study 141 differentially expressed proteins spots were noticed in resistant and susceptible cultivars in F. udum and pigeonpea interaction. Of them, 12 were successfully characterized by using MALDI TOF MS/ MS. The identified proteins belong to seven functional groups viz., metabolism related proteins, biosynthetic process related, defense related, redox homeostasis proteins, signalling protein and a pathogen cell wall protein. This is the first piece of work on pigeonpea wilt proteomics. Out of 52 genotypes screened, 12 were resistant, 14 were moderately resistant, 11 were moderately susceptible and 15 were showed susceptible reaction. The highest vigour index of moderately resistant (BMR- 736) and susceptible cultivar (ICP 2376) was recorded in P. fluorescens (RP- 46) + P. putida (RP- 56) treated seeds. The maximum activity of defense related enzymes like, PO, PPO and PAL was recorded in seeds treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens (RP- 46) and challenged with F. udum (FU- 37). Under glasshouse, condition seed treatment with P. fluorescens (RP- 46) recorded least wilt incidence (8. 34 %) in moderately resistant cultivar (BSMR- 736) and 29. 17 per centin susceptible cultivar (ICP 2376). Captan among non-systemic fungicides, <b>carbendazim</b> <b>and</b> <b>benomyl</b> among systemic fungicides and Trichoderma harzianum (Th-R) among the bio-agent were effective under in-vitro selected for disease management under field condition.

40|$|The {{powdery mildew}} fungus Podosphaera fusca (synonym Podosphaera xanthii) {{is the main}} causal agent of cucurbit powdery mildew {{and one of the}} most {{important}} limiting factors for cucurbit production worldwide. Despite the fungus economic importance, very little is known about the physiological and molecular processes involved in P. fusca biology and pathogenesis. In this study, we isolated and characterised the β-tubulin-encoding gene of P. fusca (PfTUB 2) to develop molecular tools with different applications in powdery mildew research. PfTUB 2 is predicted to encode a protein of 447 amino acid residues. The coding region is interrupted by six introns that occur at approximately the same positions as the introns present in other fungal TUB 2 -like genes. Once cloned, the PfTUB 2 sequence information was used in different applications. Our results showed that the TUB 2 gene is a good marker for molecular phylogenetics in powdery mildew fungi but it is unsuitable for the analysis of intraspecific diversity in P. fusca. The expression of PfTUB 2 was proven to be stable in different temperature conditions, supporting its use as a reference gene in quantitative gene expression studies. Furthermore, an allele-specific PCR assay for the detection of resistance to methyl- 2 -benzimidazole carbamate (MBC) fungicides in P. fusca was developed based on the correlation between the single amino acid change E 198 A in β-tubulin and the MBC resistance phenotype. Lastly, PfTUB 2 was used as a target gene in the development of a high-throughput method to quantify fungal growth in plant tissues. The cucurbit powdery mildew fungus Podosphaera fusca, is a major limiting factor for cucurbit production worldwide. Despite its agronomic and economic importance, very little is known about fundamental aspects of P. fusca biology such as obligate biotrophy and pathogenesis. In order to design novel and more durable control strategies, genomic information of P. fusca is needed. In order to reduce genome complexity, in this work we aimed to obtain and analyse the epiphytic transcriptome of P. fusca as starting point. Total RNA was isolated from epiphytic fungal material composed by mycelia and conidia, and the corresponding cDNA library was sequenced using a 454 GS FLX platform. Over 676, 562 reads were obtained and assembled into 39, 346 contigs. Annotation data was acquired for 62. 6 % of the assembled sequences, identifying 9, 713 putative genes with different orthologues. In the transcript data set, the most represented protein functions were those with role in gene expression, protein metabolism, regulation of biological process and organelle organization. Our analysis also confirmed the existence of missing ascomycete core genes (MACGs) found in previous studies. To get insight into the plant-pathogen relationships, special attention was focused on the analysis of the pool of fungal secreted proteins. After analysis, 119 putative secreted proteins were identified, including 35 candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs) specific for P. fusca. In order to validate the in silico assembly, a time-course transcriptional profiling of some selected CSEP genes was performed during the course of infection. The expression profile observed for these CSEPs was consequent with a canonical effector expression pattern, with a maximum of expression at the beginning of the infection process 24 - 48 h after inoculation. Our data open the genomics era of this very important cucurbit pathogen. Methyl benzimidazole carbamates (MBC) such as <b>carbendazim</b> <b>and</b> <b>benomyl</b> are fungicidal compounds that exert their biological activity preventing cell division, due to inhibition of the polymerization of tubulin, the major component of microtubules. MBC fungicides have been widely used against powdery mildews (Erysiphales), a constant threat to many crops worldwide. Despite the effectiveness of MBC fungicides in disease control, their misuse in the past has led to the problem of fungicide resistance and thus the loss of efficacy. Although diverse mutations seem to contribute to MBC resistance in powdery mildews and other fungal pathogens, the most common mechanism of resistance against MBCs is provided by the substitution of glutamic acid to alanine at position 198 (E 198 A). However, the precise mechanism by which this amino acid change affects fungicide binding is still unknown. The aim of this work was to elucidate the mode of action and the molecular basis of resistance to MBC fungicides in Podosphaera fusca, the main causal agent of cucurbits powdery mildew in Spain. By a combination of techniques, we show that carbendazim, a paradigm of MBC fungicides, induces conformational changes to β-tubulin, leading to the formation of aberrant tubulin structures. Furthermore, by computational analysis we have evaluated topologically the interaction of the fungicide molecule and the target protein. Our results allowed us to propose a novel binding site for MBCs to β-tubulin in a protein region very close to the GTP binding site. In absence of more conclusive crystallographic data, our results provided new insights about the mode of action and resistance to MBC fungicides, information that could help on new fungicide design...|$|E

Plots without fungicide treatment constituted the control. Treatments {{were laid out}} in a randomized complete block design (12 treatments in 3 replications) with plots of four rows, 7 m long and 2 m apart. Applications, in number of three, were performed every 10 days with a costal sprayer. Fungicides were first applied when plants presented a moderate incidence of leaf anthracnose. Anthracnose evaluations were made at the day of the first application and 20 and 45 days later, using a 0 to 5 scale (0 = no symptoms and 5 = dead plants). Seeds were submitted to a seed health test through the deep freezing method, and, for the quantification of the production, the weights of the seeds were adjusted for 13 % of humidity. Results showed that the fungicides prochloraz, <b>carbendazim,</b> <b>benomyl</b> <b>and</b> azoxystrobin were the most efficient in the control of leaf anthracnose, as indicated by the anthracnose progress within the 45 days interval of evaluation. The results also evidenced that the smallest incidence of C. graminicola on seeds happened in the treatments with <b>carbendazim,</b> azoxystrobin <b>and</b> prochloraz; and that the largest weights of seeds were obtained with the treatments prochloraz, <b>carbendazim,</b> <b>benomyl</b> <b>and</b> azoxystrobin...|$|R

Positive results- which certainly need further confirmation- have been obtained for MMS, p-fluorophenylalanine, vincristine, procarbazine, <b>carbendazim,</b> <b>and</b> bleomycin. Nocodazole, <b>benomyl,</b> colcemid, 6 -mercaptopurine, and halothane were all negative at the concentrations tested. For the induction of diploid spermatids positive results were only obtained for MMS and parafluorophenylalanine. In view of the results obtained, the Microtus system is considered a very useful tool for analyzing factors contributing to the high frequency of aneuploidy and triploidy among abortuses and of aneuploidy in liveborn infants of men. A method is described {{for the detection of}} sex-chromosome nondisjunction and diploid spermatids in male germ cells of the field vole Microtus oeconomus. The method is based on the unique distribution pattern of heterochromatin in Microtus cells, which makes it possible to identify X and Y chromosomes in early spermatids with a simple C-banding procedure. Slide preparation is easy. Scoring of early spermatids for extra sex-chromosomes is simple and 2000 - 4000 cells per hour can be examined. With the Microtus system it has now been demonstrated that radiation of spermatocyte stages with doses of 50, 100 and 200 R results in a higher frequency of sex chromosome nondisjunction and of diploid gametes.

To resolve the problem of supplying seeds throughout the year, this study explores the effects that fungicide pretreatment and storage temperature have on the storage longevity of P. macrocarpa seeds, and develops effective and practical seed storage technology. The seeds were pretreated with the fungicides <b>benomyl</b> <b>and</b> <b>carbendazim,</b> <b>and</b> then stored at 13 ˚C, 18 ˚C, and 23 ˚C. The results showed that the seeds infected rate during storage increased in correlation with the storage temperature and duration. The seeds pretreated with <b>carbendazim</b> <b>and</b> stored at 13 ˚C and 18 ºC had a seeds infected rate ranging between 0 % and 30 % after 4 to 16 weeks of storage. The seeds had not developed infected and exhibited 100 % germination rate after sowing. The treatments as control group that were not pretreated with fungicide before storage at 23 ˚C for 8 weeks all developed infected. For the control groups stored at 18 ˚C and 13 ˚C, infection development was delayed until week 12. However, the seeds infected rate achieved 100 %, and all seeds died.

Cytotoxicity in the bone marrow was evidenced by the following combinations: a) paraquat and linuron b) captan <b>and</b> <b>carbendazim</b> <b>and</b> c) thiram and thiophanate methyl. Cytotoxicity was also caused by the formulations of linuron, <b>carbendazim,</b> thiram <b>and</b> thiophanate methyl while a weak decrease of the PCE / RBC % ratio, used as bone marrow cytotoxicity indicator, was observed from paraquat and captan formulations. DNA strand breaks were caused only by the paraquat and linuron formulations when they were administered separately and to a smaller extent, from pendimethalin formulation. A less than additive interaction with respect to the MN incidence was observed from the combination of captan <b>and</b> <b>carbendazim</b> formulations. A lower than expected cytotoxicity in bone marrow was observed for the combination of paraquat and linuron formulations while the cytotoxicity observed for the combination of captan <b>and</b> <b>carbendazim</b> formulations was greater than the expected one. Finally, interaction was observed between the formulations of paraquat and linuron, which resulted in the inhibition of the inducement of DNA strand breaks observed when both formulations were administered separately. The studies that were performed during the current dissertation indicated the necessity for studying the combinations of the pesticides’ formulations, usually used in agriculture, {{in the same way as}} it is done for the individual active substances, instead of predicting their potency based on existing data for the respective active substances and assuming zero interaction between them. This need is even more imperative in the case of genotoxicity studies as according to EU 91 / 414 /EEC directive, the use of genotoxic active substances, as well as their formulation or formulations’ combinations, is prohibited in all EU member states. ...|$|R

The formulations included cyproconazol / carbendazim (Alto-Ambel, 46 % SC); Flutriafol / carbendazim (Shafy, 24. 4 % SC); Propiconazol / cabendazim (Tilt CB, 18. 75 % SC) <b>and</b> <b>Carbendazim</b> (50 % WP). Test fungi were Alternaria tritici, Fusarium graminearum and Helminthosporium sativum. Results of laboratory tests indicated that, Alto-Ambel formulation showed the strongest inhibitory effect of H. sativum hyphal growth, followed by Shafy and Tilt CB formulations. Carbendazim exhibited the strongest effect against F. graminearum, but without appreciable effect on either A. tritici or H. sativum hyphal growth. Field experiment showed that, application of any of the formulations on wheat, 4 – 5 weeks after seeding produced good control of root-rot and leaf spot diseases of wheat, and Alto-Ambel (46 % SC) was the strongest in decreasing disease severity of leaf spot caused by Alternaria and Helminthosporium, whereas Tilt CB (18. 75 % SC) was the strongest against root-rot caused by Fusarium and Helminthosporium.

40|$|In the environment, {{chemical}} substances appear as complex mixtures and consequently organisms {{are exposed to}} a variety of chemicals from different sources (e. g. wastewater treatment plants, agriculture runoffs). When studying chemical mixtures, there are two conceptual models usually used to predict toxicity: the Independent Action (IA) and Concentration Addition (CA) models. However, deviations from these reference models can occur as synergism or antagonism, dose ratio or dose level dependency. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effects of triclosan <b>and</b> <b>carbendazim,</b> <b>and</b> their binary mixture to Daphnia magna. With this purpose, immobilisation, feeding inhibition, and reproduction were assessed as main ecotoxicity endpoints. In addition, in vivo genotoxicity of both chemicals was investigated using the comet assay. In the single exposure, carbendazim was more toxic to D. magna than triclosan. When daphnids were exposed to both single compounds, DNA damage was observed. Concerning mixture exposures, different endpoints followed different patterns of response, from additivity: IA model (feeding inhibition and reproduction data), to deviations that indicate interaction between chemicals inside the organism: dose level dependency (immobilisation data) and dose ratio dependency (DNA damage). This study showed that additivity does not rule the dose–effect relation in chemical mixtures of <b>carbendazim</b> <b>and</b> triclosan and interactions between both chemicals might induce generally higher toxicity than predicted based on single chemical exposures...|$|R

40|$|Benomyl, a tubulin-targeted antimitotic {{antifungal}} agent, {{belongs to}} the benzimidazole group of compounds, which are known to inhibit the binding of colchicine to tubulin. Therefore, benomyl was thought to bind {{at or near the}} colchicine-binding site on tubulin. However, recent mutational studies in yeast and fluorescence studies involving competitive binding of <b>benomyl</b> <b>and</b> colchicine on goat brain tubulin suggested that benomyl may bind to tubulin at a site distinct from the colchicine-binding site. We set out to examine whether colchicine <b>and</b> <b>benomyl</b> bind to tubulin at distinct sites using a human cervical cancer (HeLa) cell line with the thinking that these agents should exert either additive or synergistic activity on cell proliferation if their binding sites on tubulin are different. We found that <b>benomyl</b> <b>and</b> colchicine synergistically inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells and blocked their cell cycle progression at mitosis. The synergistic activity of <b>benomyl</b> <b>and</b> colchicine was also apparent from their strong depolymerizing effects on both the spindle and interphase microtubules when used in combinations, providing further evidence that these agents bind to tubulin at different sites. Using NMR spectroscopy, we finally demonstrated that <b>benomyl</b> <b>and</b> colchicine bind to tubulin at different sites and that the binding of colchicine seems to positively influence the binding of <b>benomyl</b> to tubulin <b>and</b> vice versa. Further, an analysis of the saturation transfer difference NMR data yielded an interesting insight into the colchicine-tubulin interaction. The data presented in this study provided a mechanistic understanding of the synergistic effects of <b>benomyl</b> <b>and</b> colchicine on HeLa cell proliferation...|$|R
