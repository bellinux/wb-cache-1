6000|$|... "Quit it! Quit it!" [...] Mr. Pike roared. [...] "This ain't a funeral! Ain't {{there one}} of you that can sing? <b>Come</b> <b>on,</b> <b>now!</b> It's a topsail-yard--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it can't {{be helped}} now," [...] said Brooke, philosophically. [...] "I suppose it's {{not your fault}} you're such an ass. Anyhow, <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>now.</b> It's struck eight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's busy. <b>Come</b> <b>on,</b> <b>now,</b> you--" [...] Babbitt reared over him. The {{attendant}} hastily {{changed to}} a coaxing [...] "You can come back and try to-morrow. Probably the poor guy is off his nut." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all, messieurs. I left {{at sunset}} (as I {{had been warned}} to do), and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was warned I should) this comrade. With him, I <b>came</b> <b>on,</b> <b>now</b> riding and now walking, {{through the rest of}} {{yesterday}} and through last night. And here you see me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're both wastin' talk. An' I'm not wantin' {{you to call}} me a liar twice. ... Put your rider up on the King an' <b>come</b> <b>on,</b> right <b>now.</b> I'll--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I {{believe it}} has all <b>come</b> <b>on</b> him <b>now</b> {{that it was his}} fault--driving Leonard to that place; and he was in such misery, that Richard could not leave him.' ...|$|R
60|$|NORA [soothingly]. You'll be able {{to judge}} better in the morning. <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> <b>now</b> back with me, an think no more about it. [She takes his arm with motherly solicitude and urges him gently toward the path].|$|E
6000|$|FLYNN (shouts to Murray as he {{is going}} out to the hall). I hit 'er for a two-bagger, Steve. <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> <b>now,</b> Bo, and bring me home! 'Atta, boy! (Grinning gleefully, he slouches out. Doctor Stanton and all the {{patients}} laugh.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, {{see where}} the grass is pressed down all nice an' round," [...] he said, pointing. [...] "A lion made that. He sneaked there, watchin' for deer. That was done this mornin'. <b>Come</b> <b>on,</b> <b>now.</b> Let's {{see if we can}} trail him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But he's to <b>come</b> <b>on</b> again <b>now</b> for a spell. It {{always seems}} to me that the bishops ain't a bit of use here. They only get blown up, and snubbed, and shoved into corners by the others." ...|$|R
60|$|An {{occasional}} cannon fired feebly at them. The cars <b>came</b> grimly <b>on.</b> <b>Now,</b> in {{the hollows}} of the hills, Sherikov's troops were hurrying {{to the surface}} to meet the attack. The first car reached {{the shadow of the}} mountains....|$|R
6000|$|Bostil {{uttered a}} laugh full {{of pride in}} his daughter. [...] "Wal, she won't show up on Blue Roan," [...] he replied, with grim gruffness. [...] "Thet's sure as death.... <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> out <b>now.</b> I want {{a look at the}} King." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know. And {{rules are}} rules, these days. Kids get routed through the shop like a motor. But look here, sister; I'm one great hand at busting rules. <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> <b>now,</b> let Uncle Perce {{have a look}} at him. Please now, sister?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Brace up, boys! brace up! This won't do at all. <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> <b>now,</b> all together!" [...] And then Colby Hall went in {{with renewed}} vigor so that inside of a few minutes more they, too, had scored another touchdown, and from this they managed to kick a goal.|$|E
6000|$|POLICEMAN--[Jocosely.] God pity {{your old}} woman! [Then matter-of-fact.] But I've {{no time for}} kidding. You're soused. I'd run you in but it's too long a walk to the station. <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> <b>now,</b> get up, or I'll fan your ears with this club. Beat it now! [He hauls YANK to his feet.] ...|$|E
50|$|Smith {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York in 1894. His started as a cinematographer <b>came</b> <b>on</b> the <b>now</b> lost 1915 silent film The Battle Cry of Peace, {{and went on to}} have over 73 credits. Smith also {{occasionally}} worked in the camera and electrical department.|$|R
6000|$|It never grew longer, and was {{prompted}} by the feeling that her face was like an April day. The cloud which <b>came</b> <b>on</b> it <b>now</b> was like an April cloud, as if a bright shower of rain must follow. Brushing aside the two distressful lines, he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly!" [...] {{and the man}} laughed. [...] "Only he {{went away}} again, or we wouldn't have <b>come</b> <b>on</b> here. <b>Now,</b> there are {{four or five of}} us, and we want a word with your husband, and mean to have it. It's not going to take us two minutes to find out if he's in the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The deer was runnin' {{here with}} the lion on his back. I'll prove it to you. <b>Come</b> <b>on,</b> <b>now.</b> Pedro, you stay with me. Girls, it's a fresh trail." [...] Dale walked along, leading his horse, and {{occasionally}} he pointed down into the grass. [...] "There! See that! That's hair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll say you will. And I'm for you strong. If it {{was only}} the booze and cards I'd not have squealed. That's my living. But by God, I can't stand for the--the other stuff any longer!... <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> <b>now.</b> And I'll put you on to a slick stunt that'll take your breath away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if you two {{are like}} me, nothing but just honest workmen, you better try and make 'em think you're working some game--tell 'em you're the Queen of the Thimble-riggers or some dern thing like that. <b>Come</b> <b>on,</b> <b>now.</b> Been {{gathering}} wood; got enough. You can follow me. The bunch ain't so very criminal--not for hoboes they ain't." ...|$|E
60|$|The Turks <b>came</b> <b>on</b> steadily, and <b>now</b> I learned, for {{the first}} time, the power of modern weapons. Our men were armed with breech-loaders, so that no time was lost in loading.|$|R
60|$|The canoe <b>came</b> <b>on</b> rapidly <b>now,</b> {{propelled}} {{by a powerful}} arm. In a few moments it was alongside, and its owner leaped on the platform. It was the gentleman with his trousers tucked in his boots, the second voice in the gloomy discussion in the general store last evening. He nodded simply to the girl, and shook Hemmingway's hand warmly.|$|R
6000|$|... "This curious animal {{lives on}} water plants. Sometimes {{it will come}} close to a river bank and with head and {{shoulders}} out of water feed on the grasses which hang down from the bank. The babies are, of course, born in the water, as the Manatee never <b>comes</b> <b>on</b> shore. <b>Now</b> I think this will end to-day's lesson and the school." ...|$|R
6000|$|She was jarred {{out of this}} serious {{sweetness}} when Marbury bounced over to {{them and}} with horrible publicity yammered, [...] "Say, what do you two think you're doing? Telling fortunes or making love? Let me warn you that the doc is a frisky bacheldore, Carol. <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> <b>now,</b> folks, shake a leg. Let's have some stunts or a dance or something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} a chance to swim for it," [...] Peter Blood continued. [...] "It's not above {{a quarter of a mile}} to the {{headland}} yonder, and with ordinary luck ye should manage it. Faith, you're fat enough to float. <b>Come</b> <b>on!</b> <b>Now,</b> don't be hesitating or it's a long voyage ye'll be going with us, and the devil knows what may happen to you. You're not loved any more than you deserve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead," [...] he answered. [...] "That's why. No," [...] {{he went on}} hastily, [...] "'tis not {{revenge for}} them. They died easily in their beds--sickness, you see, one time and another. They tied my arms while they lived. And now that they're gone, 'tis revenge for my blasted manhood I'm after. I was once Peter Donnelly, the scab foreman. But to-night I'm Number 27 of the 'Frisco Reds. <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> <b>now,</b> and I'll {{get you out of}} this." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told her}} I {{had met her}} on Saturday last, had been so {{fortunate}} as to render her a trifling service, and was <b>come</b> <b>now</b> <b>on</b> the young lady's invitation.|$|R
60|$|Oh, God! Who was this? Oh, God! {{there before}} her stood Dirk van Goorl. Dirk, {{and no other}} than Dirk, unless she dreamed, Dirk with his kind face wreathed in a happy smile, Dirk with his arms outstretched towards her. Lysbeth said nothing, she could not speak, only she stood still gazing, gazing, gazing, and always he <b>came</b> <b>on,</b> till <b>now</b> his arms were round her. Then she sprang back.|$|R
60|$|She {{was losing}} {{way as a}} result of that {{curtailment}} of her mainmast, and the Spaniard <b>came</b> <b>on</b> swiftly <b>now.</b> At last the skipper accounted her near enough, and gave the word with an oath. The Swallow fired her first and last shot in that encounter. After the deafening thunder of it and through the cloud of suffocating smoke, Sir Oliver saw the high forecastle of the Spaniard rent open.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jump in, Mr. Spring jump in!" [...] he cried, as he reined up. [...] "They're all coming, {{dogs and}} men! <b>Come</b> <b>on!</b> <b>Now,</b> hud up, Ginger!" [...] Not another word {{did he say}} until two miles of lanes {{had been left behind}} them at racing speed and they were back in safety upon the Brighton road. Then he let the reins hang loose on the pony's back, and he slapped Tom Spring with his fat hand upon the shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|THE MEN [pulling {{the women}} away from Blanco, {{and getting them}} out partly by {{violence}} and partly by coaxing] Here! come out of this. Let him alone. Clear the courthouse. <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> <b>now.</b> Out with you. Now, Sally: out you go. Let go my hair, or I'll twist your arm out. Ah, would you? Now, then: get along. You know you must go. Whats the use of scratching like that? Now, ladies, ladies, ladies. How would you like it {{if you were going}} to be hanged? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aunt Olive won't care a bit, an' she'll {{be glad to}} have you, I know, 'cause {{she says}} it always does her good to see hungry people eat, though if that's so I must have done her an awful sight of good lots of times, for it don't seem to me I ever set down to the table in my life but what I was awful hungry. <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> <b>now,</b> so's we'll {{have time to get}} our hands an' faces washed before the dinner-bell rings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seventy-five will do. Haste thee, carle, {{and lead}} them to my longship the Swan. Methinks we will skate upon the ocean to-night. [Longships, or war-vessels, were {{sometimes}} called ocean-skates.] I will follow thee. Let every man be at his post, and quit not the shore till I <b>come</b> <b>on</b> board. <b>Now</b> fare away as swiftly as may be, and see that everything be done stealthily; above all, keep well {{out of sight of}} Ulfstede." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will meet}} at the club to-morrow afternoon," [...] Selingman declared. [...] "But why not <b>come</b> <b>on</b> with us <b>now?</b> You are not weary? They are taking me to a supper club, these young people. I have engaged myself to dance with Miss Morgen--I, who weigh {{nineteen}} stone! It will be a thing to see. Come with us." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{of course}} Frank {{could not do}} other than hit him anywhere. When a gentleman is dancing about with much energy it is hardly {{possible}} to strike him fairly on his back. The blows, therefore, <b>came</b> <b>now</b> <b>on</b> his legs and <b>now</b> <b>on</b> his head; and Frank unfortunately got more than his five or six shies before he was interrupted.|$|R
