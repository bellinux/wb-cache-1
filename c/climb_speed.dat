25|$|AVAir Flight 3378 {{took off}} from Raleigh–Durham International Airport at 21:25 local time and climbed to a height of 300 feet. Shortly after, the last {{transmission}} from the aircraft to the air traffic control was heard. The aircraft maintained an appropriate <b>climb</b> <b>speed</b> but at an excessive rate of turn, 40 to 45 degrees; a standard turn rate would have been 22 degrees. Due to the turn, the plane started to descend. The aircraft then struck {{the water in a}} reservoir 100 feet from the shoreline, at a point 5100 feet west of runway 23R. The wreckage then continued onto land and into a forest. Some post-crash fires also were seen at the crash site, but were quickly extinguished.|$|E
25|$|The same aircraft, {{along with}} another TE.1, was amongst eight contestants in the Concours d'Avions Économiques or light-plane contest held at Orly between 9-15 August 1926. The aim was to decide the most {{practical}} of the five different types, including ease of folding/wing detachment for road transport, the ability to accommodate parachutes and fire protection, as well as performance (take off distance, <b>climb,</b> <b>speed)</b> and fuel efficiency; more controversial was an economy coefficient which deliberately enhanced the final scores of two-seaters {{on the grounds of}} their greater practicality. The two Albert machines were the fastest present and were placed first and second before the economy coefficient was applied, after which they fell behind the two two-seat Avia BH-11s into third and fourth place.|$|E
25|$|A turbine-powered aircraft's takeoff {{procedure}} is designed around ensuring that an engine failure will not endanger the flight. This {{is done by}} planning the takeoff around three critical V speeds, V1, VR and V2. V1 is the critical engine failure recognition speed, {{the speed at which}} a takeoff can be continued with an engine failure, and the speed at which stopping distance is no longer guaranteed {{in the event of a}} rejected takeoff. VR is the speed at which the nose is lifted off the runway, a process known as rotation. V2 is the single-engine safety speed, the single engine <b>climb</b> <b>speed.</b> The use of these speeds ensure that either sufficient thrust to continue the takeoff, or sufficient stopping distance to reject it will be available at all times.|$|E

40|$|Studies of whole-organism {{performance}} {{are central to}} understanding the links between animal behaviour, morphology, and fitness. Invertebrates have been popular models for studies of behaviour, {{although there have been}} few detailed studies of their whole-organism performance, links between performance and morphology, or trade-offs amongst different performance dimensions. In the present study, we investigate four facets of whole-organism performance (running <b>speed,</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>speed,</b> endurance, and pulling force) in males of a jumping spider (Servaea incana). We consider links between these performance traits and their association with three morphological measures expected to influence maximum performance capacity: body size, relative leg length, and relative body mass (condition). Running <b>speed,</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>speed,</b> and pulling force were all positively related, suggesting that selection for one may positively effect all. By contrast, endurance capacity decreased with running and <b>climbing</b> <b>speed,</b> suggesting an evolutionary trade-off. Associations amongst performance measures cannot be explained solely as correlates of morphology: large size was associated with greater running <b>speed,</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>speed,</b> and pulling force but not with endurance; relative leg length was associated with pulling force but not other performance traits; relative mass was associated with <b>climbing</b> <b>speed</b> and endurance but not running speed or pulling force. 14 page(s...|$|R

2500|$|Although 13 of North Vietnam's flying aces {{attained}} {{their status}} while flying the MiG-21 (cf. {{three in the}} MiG-17) many North Vietnamese pilots preferred the MiG-17 because the high wing loading of the MiG-21 made it relatively less maneuverable and the lighter framed canopy of the MiG-17 gave better visibility. However, {{this is not the}} impression perceived by British author Roger Boniface when he interviewed Pham Ngoc Lan and ace Nguyễn Nhật Chiêu (who scored victories flying both MiG-17 and MiG-21). Pham Ngoc Lan told Boniface that [...] "The MiG-21 was much faster, and it had two ATOLL missiles which were very accurate and reliable when fired between 1,000 and 1,200 yards."

40|$|The gravity {{hypothesis}} of sexual size dimorphism {{can explain the}} patterns of extreme sexual size dimorphism in spiders (males smaller than females) because small males climb faster and therefore may be better at reaching females that live in high habitats. Recently, the main prediction of a negative relationship between <b>climbing</b> <b>speed</b> and body size in spiders has been called into question. Here we induced males and females of the spider Leucauge venusta (Tetragnathidae) to run on vertical surfaces and found partial support for the gravity hypothesis. As predicted, males climb faster than females and we demonstrated that this effect is an indirect effect mediated by the negative relationship between body mass and <b>climbing</b> <b>speed.</b> We validate our results using simulated data showing that there is enough statistical efficiency in our data set to support our conclusions. We distinguished between direct and indirect effects (through mass) on sex differences in <b>climbing</b> <b>speed</b> by means of path analysis. Thus, we provide empirical evidence that by being smaller, males are able to climb faster than females. However, we found only a barely significant negative relationship between <b>climbing</b> <b>speed</b> and body size when only males were considered.
