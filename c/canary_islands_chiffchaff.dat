5|$|P. canariensis, the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>chiffchaff</b> is a {{non-migratory}} species formerly occurring on {{the major}} Canary Islands, which is differentiated from P. collybita by morphology, vocalisations and genetic characteristics, and, of course, is not sympatric with any other chiffchaffs. The nominate western subspecies P. c. canariensis of El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife, and Gran Canaria is smaller than common chiffchaff, and has shorter, rounder wings. It is olive-brown above and has a buff breast and flanks; it has a rich deep chip-cheep-cheep-chip-chip-cheep song, and a call similar to the nominate race. The eastern P. c. exsul of Lanzarote and possibly Fuerteventura is paler above and less rufous below than its western relative, and had a harsher call; {{it might have been}} a distinct species, but it became extinct in 1986 at latest, probably much earlier. The reasons for its extinction are unclear, but it appears always to have been scarce and localised, occurring only in the Haria Valley of Lanzarote.|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial fauna {{includes}} geckos, wall lizards, {{and three}} endemic species of recently rediscovered and critically endangered giant lizard: the El Hierro giant lizard (or Roque Chico de Salmor giant lizard), La Gomera giant lizard, and La Palma giant lizard. Mammals include the Canarian shrew, Canary big-eared bat, the Algerian hedgehog (which {{may have been}} introduced) and the more recently introduced mouflon. Some endemic mammals, the lava mouse, Tenerife giant rat and Gran Canaria giant rat, are extinct, as are the Canary Islands quail, long-legged bunting, and the eastern <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>chiffchaff.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>{{chiffchaff}}</b> {{is similar}} to the common chiffchaff and the Iberian chiffchaff but compared to the common chiffchaff it has a longer bill, shorter wings and a longer tail. Its underparts have a brownish-buff tone, especially on the flanks and breast, and the upperparts are darker brown than the common chiffchaff.|$|E
50|$|In the {{breeding}} period, January to June, the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>chiffchaff</b> is territorial and is found singly or in pairs, the nest is a spherical structure {{with a side}} entrance and is place near the ground in coastal scrub but higher (8m plus) up in the laurisilva. The clutch is 2-5 eggs and most pairs are triple brooded. When not breeding they are more sociable in the autumn and the winter when it forms small flocks. The post-breeding moult is usually completed by late July. The <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>chiffchaff</b> spends much of its time foraging for its insect food among foliage from ground level up to the tree canopy, although it will also sometimes hover glean and fly catch.It is an active little bird with quick and frenzied movements, frequently flicking its wings and wagging or flicking its tail.|$|E

50|$|The {{flowers of}} Lotus berthelotii {{and some other}} Canary Island species appear to be adapted for bird pollination. It was once thought that the {{original}} pollinators of these plants (and other genera such as Isoplexis and Canarina) were sunbirds which had become extinct on the Canary Islands, explaining why they are rare and considered endangered species (Vogel 1954; Vogel et al. 1984; Valido et al. 2004). However more recent work has shown that these plants are adequately pollinated by non-specialist flower visiting birds, particularly the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>chiffchaff</b> (Phylloscopus canariensis), and in fact show some specific adaptations to infrequent pollination by these birds, such as extended flower lifespans.|$|E
