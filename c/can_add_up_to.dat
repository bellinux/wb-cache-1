25|$|Xu, using atomic force microscopy, {{has shown}} that {{formation}} of amyloid fibers is a two-step process in which proteins first aggregate into colloidal spheres of ~20nm diameter. The spheres then join together spontaneously to form linear chains, which evolve into mature amyloid fibers. The formation of these linear chains appears {{to be driven by}} the development of an electrostatic dipole in each of the colloidal spheres strong enough to overcome coulomb repulsion. This suggests a possible mechanism by which alpha sheet may promote amyloid aggregation; the peptide bond has a relatively large intrinsic electrostatic dipole, but normally the dipoles of nearby bonds cancel each other out. In the alpha sheet, unlike other conformations, the peptide bonds are oriented in parallel so that the dipoles of the individual bonds <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> create a strong overall electrostatic dipole.|$|E

In 2002 a kayaker and tuber were killed in separate instances as a result of LWD in the stream; both deaths led to lawsuits against property owners.

50|$|UHMWPE {{is a type}} of polyolefin. It is made up of {{extremely}} long chains of polyethylene, which all align in the same direction. It derives its strength largely from the length of each individual molecule (chain). Van der Waals bonds between the molecules are relatively weak for each atom of overlap between the molecules, but because the molecules are very long, large overlaps <b>can</b> exist, <b>adding</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the ability to carry larger shear forces from molecule to molecule. Each chain is bonded to the others with so many van der Waals bonds that the whole of the inter-molecule strength is high. In this way, large tensile loads are not limited as much by the comparative weakness of each van der Waals bond.|$|R

40|$|Salt, an {{essential}} mineral, {{has been associated}} with hypertension and an optimum intake is suggested for good health. Processed foods, specially fried and baked snacks can be a major contributor of salt in diets. Hence, the present study was undertaken to investigate the salt consumption behavior among selected adults using a structured questionnaire and to determine the salt and fat contents of common processed snacks. The respondents were 500 adult men and women, who volunteered {{to be a part of}} survey. As a second phase of the study, selected commercial processed foods such as salt biscuits, packaged and non-packaged fried snacks were analyzed for salt and fat contents. Results indicated that majority of subjects had a high salt intake of > 16. 0 g/day. They were aware of high salt products, though were unwilling to cut down salt in their diet. The salt and fat contents of both packages and non-packaged snack foods from commercial sources contained high salt and fat contents and they <b>can</b> potentially <b>add</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a considerable salt content in the diet...|$|R
50|$|Although VAV hoods {{are much}} more complex than {{traditional}} constant-volume hoods, and correspondingly have higher initial costs, they can provide considerable energy savings by reducing the total volume of conditioned air exhausted from the laboratory. Since most hoods are operated the entire time a laboratory is open, this <b>can</b> quickly <b>add</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> significant cost savings. These savings are, however, completely contingent on user behavior: the less the hoods are open (both in terms of height {{and in terms of}} time), the greater the energy savings. For example, if the laboratory's ventilation system uses 100% once-through outside air and the value of conditioned air is assumed to be $7 per CFM per year (this value would increase with very hot, cold or humid climates), a 6-foot VAV fume hood at full open for experiment set up 10% of the time (2.4 hours per day), at 18 inch working opening 25% of the time (6 hours per day), and completely closed 65% of the time (15.6 hours per day) would save approximately $6,000 every year compared to a hood that is fully open 100% of the time.|$|R
40|$|At the {{previous}} workshop we reported some numerical investigations on the wave response of a rectangular barge in varying bathymetry (Liu et al. 2010). We obtained that the wave drift force can be negative (opposite to the wave direction) in some cases.

In this abstract we present results from preliminary numerical investigations on the latter case. Results from the experiments will be shown at the workshop. We consider the same geometry as in Liu et al. (2010) : the barge has a beam of 1 m, a draft of 0. 40 m and the waterdepth is 0. 80 m. Its center of gravity is located 0. 10 m below the free surface level and its roll radius of inertia is 0. 33 m. It is free {{to respond to the}} waves.
