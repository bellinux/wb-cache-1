5|$|For {{potentially}} <b>curable</b> SCLC cases, chest radiotherapy {{is often}} recommended {{in addition to}} chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{myeloid leukemia}} is a <b>curable</b> disease; {{the chance of}} cure for a {{specific}} person depends {{on a number of}} prognostic factors.|$|E
5|$|Avoidance of risk factors, {{including}} {{smoking and}} air pollution, {{is the primary}} method of prevention. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend {{on the type of}} cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not <b>curable.</b> Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Palliative care is {{specialized}} {{medical care}} for people with serious illnesses, including Parkinson's. The goal of this speciality is to improve {{quality of life for}} both the person suffering from Parkinson's and the family by providing relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of illnesses. As Parkinson's is not a <b>curable</b> disease, all treatments are focused on slowing decline and improving quality of life, and are therefore palliative in nature.|$|E
5|$|The M3 subtype of AML, {{also known}} as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is almost universally treated with the drug all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in {{addition}} to induction chemotherapy, usually an anthracycline. Care {{must be taken to}} prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), complicating the treatment of APL when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the peripheral circulation. APL is eminently <b>curable,</b> with well-documented treatment protocols.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid cancers {{are treated}} by {{removing}} the whole or part of thyroid gland. Radioactive Iodine 131 may be given to radioablate the thyroid. Thyroxine is given to replace the hormones lost and to suppress TSH production, as TSH may stimulate recurrence. With {{the exception of the}} rare anaplastic thyroid cancer, which carries a very poor prognosis, most thyroid cancers carry an excellent prognosis and can even be considered <b>curable.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{the lesion}} is localized, it is {{generally}} <b>curable.</b> However, long-term survival for children with advanced disease older than 18 months of age is poor despite aggressive multimodal therapy (intensive chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, stem cell transplant, differentiation agent isotretinoin also called 13-cis-retinoic acid, and frequently immunotherapy with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody therapy).|$|E
5|$|A 1994 {{analysis}} of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D. A. B. Young concluded that his medical symptomsmdash&including his past relapses, fevers and hepatic conditionsmdash&were {{much closer to}} those resulting from hepatic amoebiasis, an illness then widespread in Madras, rather than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of dysentery before he left India. When not properly treated, dysentery can lie dormant for years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis, whose diagnosis was not then well established. Amoebiasis was a treatable and often <b>curable</b> disease at the time.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{arrives at}} the Valakian homeworld, where they are met by Esaak, the Valakian {{director}} of a clinic, and Larr, a Menk orderly. T'Pol, Phlox, Archer, and Ensign Sato make {{a tour of the}} medical facility. Sato discovers that there is a second lesser-evolved yet unaffected race, the Menk, who live alongside the Valakians. Phlox makes the startling discovery that the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily <b>curable</b> medical condition, but because of a genetic disease which is experiencing an accelerated rate of mutation. He also believes that the answer to a cure may lie in the Menk.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{military}} and government conducted many interrogations, asking if women {{had ever had}} sexual relations with another woman and essentially equating even a one-time experience to a criminal identity, thereby severely delineating heterosexuals from homosexuals. In 1952 homosexuality was listed as a pathological emotional disturbance in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. The view that homosexuality was a <b>curable</b> sickness was widely believed in the medical community, general population, and among many lesbians themselves.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly <b>curable</b> in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} way of preventing STIs is by not having sex. Some vaccinations may also decrease the risk of certain infections including hepatitis B and some types of HPV. Safer sex practices such as use of condoms, having {{a smaller number of}} sexual partners, and being in a relationship where each person only has sex with the other also decreases the risk. Circumcision in males may be effective to prevent some infections. Most STIs are treatable or <b>curable.</b> Of the most common infections, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis are <b>curable,</b> while herpes, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, and HPV are treatable but not <b>curable.</b> Resistance to certain antibiotics is developing among some organisms such as gonorrhea.|$|E
25|$|Current {{treatments}} are rarely able to cure metastatic cancer though some tumors, such as testicular cancer and thyroid cancer, are usually <b>curable.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{condition}} is usually <b>curable</b> with appropriate treatment, or sometimes it heals spontaneously. If it is painless, {{there is little}} cause for concern.|$|E
25|$|This {{potential}} drawback manifests {{in extreme}} forms {{in such cases}} as Christian Scientists who rely on prayers instead of seeking medical treatment for family members for easily <b>curable</b> conditions which later result in death.|$|E
25|$|PKU is not <b>curable.</b> However, if PKU is {{diagnosed}} early enough, an affected newborn can {{grow up with}} normal brain development by managing and controlling phenylalanine ("Phe") levels through diet, {{or a combination of}} diet and medication.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization {{estimates}} that 88 million cases of gonorrhea occur each year, {{out of the}} 448 million new cases of all <b>curable</b> STI each year – that also includes syphilis, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. In 2013, it caused about 3,200 deaths, up from 2,300 in 1990.|$|E
25|$|As of 15 August 2017 Bain {{has over}} two million {{subscribers}} on his YouTube channel. In October 2015, Bain announced via Twitter {{that he has}} terminal cancer, with an average life expectancy of 2–3 years. However, as of January 2017, his cancer has regressed and is now considered <b>curable.</b>|$|E
25|$|While not <b>curable,</b> {{treatment}} usually improves symptoms. Treatment {{is typically}} with metronidazole, doxycycline, or tetracycline. When {{the eyes are}} affected azithromycin eye drops may help. Other treatments with tentative benefit include brimonidine cream, ivermectin cream, and isotretinoin. Dermabrasion or laser surgery may also be used. The use of sunscreen is typically recommended.|$|E
25|$|Seminoma (also {{known as}} pure seminoma or {{classical}} seminoma) is a germ cell tumor of the testicle or, more rarely, the mediastinum or other extra-gonadal locations. It is a malignant neoplasm {{and is one}} of the most treatable and <b>curable</b> cancers, with a survival rate above 95% if discovered in early stages.|$|E
25|$|Treatments {{used for}} {{colorectal}} cancer may include {{some combination of}} surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within {{the wall of the}} colon may be <b>curable</b> with surgery while cancer that has spread widely are usually not <b>curable,</b> with management being directed towards improving quality of life and symptoms. Five year survival rates in the United States are around 65%. This, however, depends on how advanced the cancer is, whether or not all the cancer can be removed with surgery, and the person's overall health. Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer making up about 10% of all cases. In 2012, there were 1.4 million new cases and 694,000 deaths from the disease. It is more common in developed countries, where more than 65% of cases are found. It is less common in women than men.|$|E
25|$|Clear-cell adenocarcinomas are histopathologically {{similar to}} other clear cell carcinomas, with clear cells and hobnail cells. They {{represent}} approximately 5–10% of epithelial ovarian cancers and are associated with endometriosis in the pelvic cavity. They are typically early-stage and therefore <b>curable</b> by surgery, but advanced clear-cell adenocarcinomas (approximately 20%) have a poor prognosis and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, {{with other}} {{government}} agencies, academic institutions, and industry, launched a national education campaign to inform {{health care providers}} and consumers about the link between H. pylori and ulcers. This campaign reinforced the news that ulcers are a <b>curable</b> infection and that health can be greatly improved and money saved by disseminating information about H. pylori.|$|E
25|$|Gonorrhea affects about 0.8% {{of women}} and 0.6% of men. An {{estimated}} 33 to 106 million new cases occur each year, out of the 498 million new cases of <b>curable</b> STI – which also includes syphilis, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. Infections in women most commonly occur when they are young adults. In 2015, it caused about 700 deaths. Descriptions of the disease date {{as far back as}} the Old Testament.|$|E
25|$|Especially in {{the later}} stages, people with {{cirrhosis}} experience significant symptoms such as abdominal swelling, itching, leg edema, and chronic abdominal pain which would be amenable for treatment through palliative care. Because the disease is not <b>curable</b> without a transplant, palliative care can also help with discussions regarding the person's wishes concerning health care power of attorney, Do Not Resuscitate decisions and life support, and potentially hospice. Despite proven benefit, people with cirrhosis are rarely referred to palliative care.|$|E
25|$|Not using tobacco {{or alcohol}} {{can reduce the}} risk. While {{screening}} {{in the general population}} {{does not appear to be}} useful, screening high risk groups by examination of the throat might be useful. Often head and neck cancer is <b>curable</b> if detected early; however, outcomes are typically poor if detected late. Treatment may include a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Following treatment of one head and neck cancer people are at higher risk of a second cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} that certain toxic chemicals administered in combination can cure certain cancers ranks {{as one of}} the greatest in modern medicine. Childhood ALL, testicular cancer, and Hodgkins disease, previously universally fatal, are now generally <b>curable</b> diseases. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown the ability to cure some cancers, including testicular cancer, Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and some leukemias. It has also proved effective in the adjuvant setting, in reducing the risk of recurrence after surgery for high-risk breast cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer, among others.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, English writer Radclyffe Hall {{published}} a novel titled The Well of Loneliness. Its plot centers on Stephen Gordon, {{a woman who}} identifies herself as an invert after reading Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis, and lives within the homosexual subculture of Paris. The novel included a foreword by Havelock Ellis and {{was intended to be}} a call for tolerance for inverts by publicizing their disadvantages and accidents of being born inverted. Hall subscribed to Ellis and Krafft-Ebing's theories and rejected (conservatively understood version of) Freud's theory that same-sex attraction was caused by childhood trauma and was <b>curable.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that prediabetes is a <b>curable</b> disease state. Intensive weight loss and lifestyle intervention, if sustained, may improve glucose tolerance substantially and prevent progression from IGT to type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study found a 16% reduction in diabetes risk for every kilogram of weight loss. Reducing weight by 7% through a low-fat diet and performing 150 minutes of exercise a week is the goal. In observational studies, individuals following vegetarian diets are about half as likely to develop diabetes, compared with non-vegetarians. The ADA guidelines recommend modest weight loss (5-10% body weight), moderate-intensity exercise (30 minutes daily), and smoking cessation.|$|E
25|$|Screening is not {{recommended}} in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and {{the high rate of}} false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks. Those at very high risk may have their ovaries removed as a preventive measure. If caught and treated in an early stage, ovarian cancer is often <b>curable.</b> Treatment usually includes some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Outcomes depend on the extent of the disease, the subtype of cancer present, and other medical conditions. The overall five-year survival rate in the United States is 45%. Outcomes are worse in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|Leprosy is <b>curable</b> with a {{treatment}} known as multidrug therapy. Treatment for paucibacillary leprosy {{is with the}} medications dapsone and rifampicin for six months. Treatment for multibacillary leprosy consists of rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine for 12 months. A number of other antibiotics may also be used. These treatments are provided free of charge by the World Health Organization. Globally in 2012, the number of chronic cases of leprosy was 189,000, down from some 5.2 million in the 1980s. The number of new cases was 230,000. Most new cases occur in 16 countries, with India accounting for more than half. In the past 20 years, 16 million people worldwide have been cured of leprosy. About 200 cases are reported {{per year in the}} United States.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{may involve}} {{one or more}} of the following: chemotherapy, {{radiation}} therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery. In some non-Hodgkin lymphomas, an increased amount of protein produced by the lymphoma cells causes the blood to become so thick that plasmapheresis is performed to remove the protein. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for certain types. The outcome depends on the subtype with some being <b>curable</b> and treatment prolonging survival in most. The five-year survival rate in the United States for all Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes is 85%, while that for non-Hodgkin lymphomas is 69%. Worldwide, lymphomas developed in 566,000 people in 2012 and caused 305,000 deaths. They make up 3–4% of all cancers, making them as a group the seventh-most common form. In children, they are the third-most common cancer. They occur more often in the developed world than the developing world.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, a major {{breakthrough}} in cancer therapy occurred. James F. Holland, Emil Freireich, and Emil Frei hypothesized that cancer chemotherapy should follow the strategy of antibiotic therapy for tuberculosis with combinations of drugs, each with a different mechanism of action. Cancer cells could conceivably mutate to become resistant to a single agent, but by using different drugs concurrently {{it would be more}} difficult for the tumor to develop resistance to the combination. Holland, Freireich, and Frei simultaneously administered methotrexate (an antifolate), vincristine (a Vinca alkaloid), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and prednisone — together referred to as the POMP regimen — and induced long-term remissions in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). With incremental refinements of original regimens, using randomized clinical studies by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the Medical Research Council in the UK (UKALL protocols) and German Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster clinical trials group (ALL-BFM protocols), ALL in children has become a largely <b>curable</b> disease.|$|E
25|$|Decreasing {{exposure}} to ultraviolet radiation {{and the use}} of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing melanoma and squamous-cell skin cancer. It is not clear if sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is usually <b>curable.</b> Treatment is generally by surgical removal but may less commonly involve radiation therapy or topical medications such as fluorouracil. Treatment of melanoma may involve some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. In those people whose disease has spread to other areas of their bodies, palliative care may be used to improve quality of life. Melanoma has one of the higher survival rates among cancers, with over 86% of people in the UK and more than 90% in the United States surviving more than 5 years. However, the researchers add that newer creams often do not contain these specific compounds, and that the combination of other ingredients tends to retain the compounds {{on the surface of the}} skin. They also add the frequent re-application reduces the risk of radical formation.|$|E
25|$|Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life? is a 1956 book by the {{psychoanalyst}} Edmund Bergler, {{in which}} the author argues that homosexuality is a <b>curable</b> illness. Bergler denies that homosexuality is caused by hormonal or other biological factors, the Oedipus complex, or having a dominant mother and a weak or absent father, instead attributing {{both male and female}} homosexuality to pre-Oedipal factors involving an unsolved masochistic conflict with the mother during the earliest period of infancy. According to Bergler, homosexuality in men reflects unconscious fear and hatred of women. Bergler argues that there are several different types of homosexuality, each with a distinct clinical profile. Bergler rejects the existence of bisexuality, maintaining that all supposed bisexuals are homosexuals, and criticizes the work of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey. He characterizes homosexual men as sexually promiscuous, and argues that this promiscuity is a result of their unsatisfying sex lives and masochistic craving for danger. Bergler argues against immediately repealing laws against homosexuality, though he suggests that such laws could perhaps be repealed in the future if other measures against homosexuality proved effective. Bergler proposes the publicizing of his ideas as a measure against homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|Many {{cases can}} be safely {{followed}} with active surveillance or watchful waiting. Other treatments may include a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy or chemotherapy. When it only occurs inside the prostate it may be <b>curable.</b> In those in whom the disease has spread to the bones, pain medications, bisphosphonates and targeted therapy, among others, may be useful. Outcomes depend on a person's age and other health problems {{as well as how}} aggressive and extensive the cancer is. Most people with prostate cancer do not end up dying from the disease. The 5-year survival rate in the United States is 99%. Globally it is the second most common type of cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in men. In 2012 it occurred in 1.1 million men and caused 307,000 deaths. It was the most common cancer in males in 84 countries, occurring more commonly in the developed world. Rates have been increasing in the developing world. Detection increased significantly in the 1980s and 1990s in many areas due to increased PSA testing. Studies of males who died from unrelated causes have found prostate cancer in 30% to 70% of those over age 60.|$|E
