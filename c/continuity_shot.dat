50|$|Two {{days later}} another {{group called the}} <b>Continuity</b> IRA <b>shot</b> dead {{a police officer in}} Craigavon, County Armagh. The officer was {{responding}} to a call from a lady in the area when he was shot {{in the back of the}} head by a sniper.|$|R
50|$|In the Transformers Animated <b>continuity,</b> Hot <b>Shot</b> was the {{original}} name for the character that would become Bumblebee. The name change was apparently due to Bumblebee's appearance in the 2007 film. He is part of Rodimus's team. In battle, he can activate flamethrowers on his arms, whose flames can burn hot enough to ignite Decepticon energy bolts.|$|R
2500|$|The shootings {{were the}} first British {{military}} fatalities in Northern Ireland since 1997. Two days later, the <b>Continuity</b> IRA <b>shot</b> dead a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officer; the first Northern Irish police officer to be killed by paramilitaries since 1998. These attacks {{marked the beginning of}} the most intensive period of [...] "dissident republican" [...] activity since the start of their campaign.|$|R
5000|$|Roberto Curti, {{author of}} Italian Gothic Horror Films, 1957-1969 noted the films amateur qualities such as {{breaking}} the 180 degree rule and lacking <b>continuity</b> between <b>shots</b> and that [...] "lighting was passable at best". The script {{was described as}} one that [...] "haphazardly assembles a bunch of Gothic stereotypes" [...] and that the plot, the production clearly saw The Cat and the Canary (1927) [...] "one too many times".|$|R
50|$|In March 2009 {{came the}} first {{security}} force fatalities {{since the end}} of the Troubles. The Real IRA shot dead two British soldiers as they collected a delivery outside Massereene Barracks in Antrim. Two other soldiers and two civilian deliverymen were also wounded by gunfire. Two days later, the <b>Continuity</b> IRA <b>shot</b> dead a PSNI officer responding to a call in Craigavon. This began the most intensive period of dissident activity since the campaign started. The number of attacks has risen each year, with 118 attacks in 2009, 239 the following year and a higher number the year after that.|$|R
5000|$|A common movie blooper is a flopped image, usually and erroneously called [...] "flipped images". Flopped {{images are}} common {{because they can}} be used to correct <b>continuity</b> errors between <b>shots</b> and are hard to see without {{extensive}} examination, whereas flipped images are very obvious. Examples of these can be found on several movie blooper sites.|$|R
50|$|As a {{narrative}} film, Anaphylaxis observes <b>shot</b> <b>continuity,</b> content and arrangement necessary for storytelling. However, the film also observes {{a set of}} strict shot-length rules to create a defined rhythm for each of its scenes. In a prosodic cinematic style, shots in Anaphylaxis come together according to defined shot-length rules in order to compose durational patterns (rhythmic units). The shots in these rhythmic units mimic in their length pattern some of the known metrical feet of poetry such as iamb (short-long), anapest (short-short-long) and trochee (long-short).|$|R
50|$|The next {{part of the}} {{schedule}} started in Kolkata from 12 October 2012. Some action episodes involving Ram Charan, Dev Gill, and others, and a few <b>continuity</b> scenes were <b>shot.</b> An entire day was spent shooting a few action episodes with Ram Charan at Chhotelal Ghat near the Mullickghat flower market, since Vinayak insisted on perfection. This portion of {{the schedule}} ended on 22 October 2012. The team returned to Hyderabad and filming continued in a set erected at Sarathi Studios. By mid November 2012, {{a majority of the}} filming was complete, with final completion expected in December 2012.|$|R
50|$|Williamson, {{as shown}} by the 1901 census in which he is {{described}} as a chemist & druggist but engaged in photography only, had entered a period of dedicated film-making during which he produced trick film The Big Swallow, with its innovative use of extreme close-up, as well as dramas Fire! and Stop Thief!, with their use of action <b>continuity</b> across multiple <b>shots</b> which established the basic grammar of film. The following year these films became available in the U.S. where they are said to have influenced Edwin Porter's Life of an American Fireman and The Great Train Robbery (both 1903).|$|R
5000|$|VisionArts {{sister company}} FutureLight, headed by Rob Bredow, {{created the first}} {{real-time}} tetherless optical motion capture (mocap) system in the industry. While {{a large amount of}} mocap data was created to animate the hero CG character for 1998s Godzilla, ultimately {{the decision was made to}} animate the Godzilla character through traditional means to keep <b>continuity</b> with <b>shots</b> being done by Centropolis Effects, a company owned by the films director Roland Emmerich. Mocap, however, was used in conjunction with Sparky for a number of key [...] "Babyzilla" [...] shots. The visual effects for Godzilla were particularly notable in that it was the first major feature film to employ CG animation integrated into a large volume of handheld camera footage, accounting for roughly 80% of the films 400 visual effects shots. VisionArt employed a Zeiss Rec Elta RL-S reflectorless laser survey head (SN 702706-0000.720 217012) to obtain precise on-set 3-D measurements for the large scale street scenes such as those filmed in Manhattan, then coupled that data with custom developed 2D to 3D camera tracking software which allowed CG characters and debris to be seamlessly integrated into the erratic hand-held camera shots.|$|R
40|$|Mapping Rohmer’ explores {{representations}} of urban {{space in the}} films of Eric Rohmer. Rohmer was the quintessential Parisian filmmaker: he lived in Paris, worked in Paris, and died in Paris. Between the late 1950 s and mid- 2000 s, he shot over twenty short films, feature films, and documentaries on location in Paris. Situated {{in the space between}} mash-up, experimental film, and digital film criticism, ‘Mapping Rohmer’ journeys through Rohmer’s Paris using only footage from his films. It looks through Rohmer’s lens, and follows the various paths that he, his actors, and his camera together traced through the city. As François Penz notes,[1] within his films, Rohmer maintained spatial <b>continuity</b> – <b>shot</b> by shot, his characters travel through contiguous locations; they stick to the map. By contrast, the lifelong path traced by Rohmer encompasses unconnected arrondissements at discontinuous times, stops and starts, loops and repeats. Its logic is more psychogeographic than topographic, and provides insight into the nature of Rohmer’s relationship with, and perception of, Paris. ‘Mapping Rohmer’ argues that individually and collectively, Rohmer’s films constitute a complex cinematic cartography, in which narrative, moving image, and urban form map onto each other. By creating new connections between Rohmer’s films, ‘Mapping Rohmer’ accents this complexity. ...|$|R
5000|$|The devices most {{inherent}} to classical Hollywood cinema {{are those of}} continuity editing. This includes the 180-degree rule, {{one of the major}} visual-spatial elements of continuity editing. The 180-degree rule keeps with the [...] "photographed play" [...] style by creating an imaginary 180-degree axis between the viewer and the shot, allowing viewers to clearly orient themselves within the position and direction of action in a scene. According to the 30-degree rule, cuts in the angle that the scene is viewed from must be significant enough for the viewer to understand the purpose of a change in perspective. Cuts that do not adhere to the 30-degree rule, known as jump cuts, are disruptive to the illusion of temporal <b>continuity</b> between <b>shots.</b> The 180-degree and 30-degree rules are elementary guidelines in film-making that preceded the official start of the classical era by over a decade, as seen in the pioneering 1902 French film A Trip to the Moon. Cutting techniques in classical continuity editing serve to help establish or maintain continuity, as in the cross cut, which establishes the concurrence of action in different locations. Jump cuts are allowed {{in the form of the}} axial cut, which does not change the angle of shooting at all, but has the clear purpose of showing a perspective closer or farther from the subject and therefore does not interfere with temporal continuity.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{multitude}} of annotation tools and annotation formatsfor {{the analysis of}} audiovisual documents are availableand address {{a wide range of}} tasks (see Elan [SW 08] andAnvil [Kip 10]). Existing approaches however remain restrictedin the visual elements they can annotate on thescreen: for example annotating on-screen arrangements ofcharacters so as to evaluate <b>continuity</b> editing over <b>shots</b> isproblematic with most annotation tools and languages. Itwould indeed be beneficial to have an annotation tool dedicatedto filmic studies with a format that would be able tonot only provide insight in analytical approaches, but alsoto support generative approaches, such as reproducing framingsand shot sequences in 3 D environments from annotatedexamples of real movies (in a way similar to [RGB 13] yetwith a more precise annotations). In this paper, we proposean annotation language broadly suited to analytical and generativecinematography systems. The language observes theaxes of timing, spatial composition, hierarchical film structure,and link to contextual elements in the film...|$|R
40|$|Researchers have {{recently}} suggested that historically mixed findings {{in studies of}} the Kuleshov effect (a classic film editing-related phenomenon whereby meaning is extracted from the interaction of sequential camera shots) might reflect differences in the relative sophistication of early vs. modern cinema audiences. Relative to experienced audiences, first-time film viewers might be less predisposed and/or able to forge the required conceptual and perceptual links between the edited shots in order to demonstrate the effect. The current study recreates the conditions that traditionally elicit this effect (whereby a neutral face comes {{to be perceived as}} expressive after it is juxtaposed with independent images: a bowl of soup, a gravestone, a child playing) to directly investigate and compare “continuity” perception in first-time and more experienced film viewers. Results confirm the presence of the Kuleshov effect for experienced viewers (explicitly only in the sadness condition) but not the first-time viewers, who failed to perceive <b>continuity</b> between the <b>shots...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} the {{continuity}} person, the script supervisor keeps track of what parts of the script have been filmed and makes notes of any deviations between what was actually filmed and what appeared in the script. They make notes on every shot, and keep track of props, blocking, and other details to ensure <b>continuity</b> between <b>shots</b> and scenes. An important part of a script supervisor's {{job is to make}} sure that actors' movements, the directions they are looking in a shot, particularly when speaking to or responding to another actor, plus the positions of props they are using and every thing else matches from shot to shot. If there is an apparent mismatch, the director must be informed immediately so that it can be reshot before the lighting setup is changed or at least before the location is wrapped and the set is struck. Not only does the job of script supervisor require a great deal of awareness and meticulous note-taking skills, it also requires much diplomacy to advise the director that they may have a problem editing something just recorded. The script supervisor is also in charge of providing the [...] "official" [...] scene numbers and take numbers to the second camera assistant (clapper loader in some countries) for the slate, as well as to the sound mixer, and to clearly note which take the director has chosen to be used (as a [...] "print," [...] in film terms) in the finished product. All of this information is then relayed to the editor every day after shooting has wrapped in the form of copies made of both the script supervisor's notes as well as their matching script pages.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Video clip {{retrieval}} plays {{a critical}} role in the content-based video retrieval. Two major concerns in this issue are: (1) automatic segmentation and retrieval of similar video clips from video database; (2) similarity ranking of similar video clips. In this paper, motivated by the maximal matching and optimal matching in graph theory, a novel approach is proposed for video clip retrieval based on matching theory. To tackle the clip segmentation and retrieval, the retrieval process is divided into two phases: shot-based retrieval and clip-based retrieval. In shot-based retrieval, a shot is temporally partitioned into several sub-shots based on motion content. The similarity among shots is measured according to the color content of sub-shots. In clip-based retrieval, candidates of similar video clips are selected by modeling the <b>continuity</b> of similar <b>shots.</b> Maximal matching based on Hungarian algorithm is then adopted to obtain the final similar video clips. To rank the similarity of the selected video clips, four different factors: visual similarity, granularity, interference and temporal order of shots are taken into consideration. These factors are modeled by optimal matching based on Kuhn-Munkres algorithm and dynamic programming. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in retrieving and ranking similar video clips...|$|R
