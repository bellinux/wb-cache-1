50|$|The {{main exciter}} is a 3,000 rpm 3-phase machine {{directly}} coupled {{to the main}} generator shaft. Cooling is effected by a closed air ventilation circuit with pannier mounted coolers supplied with cooling water from the <b>condensate</b> <b>system.</b> The exciter output is rectified by a 3-phase bridge-connected group of silicon diodes which are natural air cooled and accommodated in a bank of nine cubicles located on a platform cantilevered {{from the side of}} the foundation block. Mounted adjacent to the rectifiers is the main field suppression circuit-breaker which incorporates a discharge resistance and auxiliary switch to close the discharge circuit. A permanent magnet high frequency generator, directly coupled to the exciter shaft, acts as a pilot exciter and supplies the exciter field via a power stage magnetic amplifier which may be regulated either by manual control or by the automatic voltage regulator. The AVR is a continuously acting regulator including such features as VAR limiting, automatic follow-up of manual control, and protection against over fluxing or over exciting of the main generator.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{operators}} had {{to prepare}} an alternate injection line for each unit, as the RCIC can run indefinitely only {{while there is}} sufficient pressure and steam in the reactor to drive its turbine; once reactor pressure drops below a certain level, the RCIC shuts down automatically. The normal AC driven Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) were {{for the most part}} unavailable due to the loss of ultimate heat sink and damage to some of the electrical infrastructure. Operators prepared for this and set up an alternate injection line using a non-emergency system known as the Makeup Water <b>Condensate</b> <b>System</b> to maintain water level which was an accident mitigation method TEPCO put in place at all its nuclear plants. The system was started and stopped in all 4 units, including unit 3, as needed to maintain the water level. The RCICs in each unit later shut down due to low reactor pressure. Operators had to also use the MUWC and the makeup water purification and filtering (MUPF) system to try to cool the suppression pool and drywell in addition to the reactor to prevent the drywell pressure from getting too high. Operators were later able to restore the High Pressure Core Spray portion of the ECCS in unit 4 and switched emergency water injection for unit 4 from the MUWC system to the HPCS. While the water level was maintained in the three cores using emergency water injection, pressures in the containment vessel continued to rise due to lack of suppression pool cooling and the operators prepared to vent the containments making restoration of heat removal urgent. Unit 1 was prioritized as it had the highest drywell pressure.|$|E

40|$|This master’s thesis {{focuses on}} the design of steam <b>condensate</b> <b>system</b> of steam power plants. Condensate is {{generated}} when fractions of extracted steam from the turbine transfer heat to feedwater in the feedwater heaters. Also small amounts of condensate form in steam pipelines due to radiation heat loss. The condensate produced in the steam using equipment and pipelines should be removed as quickly as possible in order to avoid various problems, such as fractures in pipeline fittings, loss of live steam and so forth. The recovered condensate is treated water containing sensible heat that accounts for approximately 10 % to 30 % of the total heat contained by the live steam. Thus the boiler fuel demand can be potentially reduced from 10 % to 20 % by economically recovering hot condensate. The proper design of <b>condensate</b> <b>system</b> requires detail knowledge about condensate piping network, different components of the system as well as various problems associated with condensate flow both in steam and condensate pipelines. In this study, major components of steam <b>condensate</b> <b>system</b> are presented, followed by a discussion of most common problems with condensate, such as water hammer, flash steam, pipe erosion and so on. For optimum design of steam <b>condensate</b> <b>system,</b> the study highlights recommendations for the slope of horizontal steam and condensate pipelines, analysis of condensate flow behaviour in upward inclined steam pipes, sizing of components, such as drain pockets, discharge lines from steam traps, and the importance of using different components in steam <b>condensate</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

Although the dew point pressure can be determined experimentally from collected laboratory samples, these measurements are frequently not available. In these cases, fluid reservoir properties are determined {{with the use of}} empirical correlations or determined iteratively using an equation of state (EOS). The objective {{of this paper is to}} present an application of genetic programming (GP) -Orthogonal Least Squares algorithm (OLS) to generate linear-in-parameters dew point pressure model represented by tree structures. The GP-OLS based gas condensate reservoir dew point pressure model was generated as a function of reservoir fluid composition (in terms of mol fractions of methane through heptanes-plus, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulphide, and the molecular weight of the heptanes-plus fraction), and reservoir temperature. The new model was developed using experimentally measurements of 245 gas <b>condensate</b> <b>systems</b> covering a wide range of gas properties and reservoir temperatures. One hundred-thirty five gas <b>condensate</b> <b>systems</b> that not introduced in building the new model were used to test and validate it against the other early published correlations.
