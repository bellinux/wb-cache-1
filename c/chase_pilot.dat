She received initial H-46 Sea Knight training in Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 3 (HC-3), and was then assigned to Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 8 (HC-8) in Norfolk, Virginia, with which she made overseas deployments to the Mediterranean, Red Sea and the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert Shield and Operation Provide Comfort. In September 1992, she was the Officer-in-Charge of an H-46 detachment sent to Miami, Florida, for Hurricane Andrew relief operations aboard [...] In January 1993, Williams began training at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. She graduated in December, and {{was assigned to the}} Rotary Wing Aircraft Test Directorate as an H-46 Project Officer and V-22 <b>chase</b> <b>pilot</b> in the T-2. Later, she was assigned as the squadron Safety Officer and flew test flights in the SH-60B/F, UH-1, AH-1W, SH-2, VH-3, H-46, CH-53, and the H-57. In December 1995, {{she went back to the}} Naval Test Pilot School as an instructor in the Rotary Wing Department and as the school's Safety Officer. There she flew the UH-60, OH-6, and the OH-58. She was then assigned to [...] as the Aircraft Handler and the Assistant Air Boss. Williams was deployed on Saipan in June 1998 when she was selected by NASA for the astronaut program. She has logged more than 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 aircraft types.|$|E

An Air Force pilot, who was filling in for another <b>chase</b> <b>pilot,</b> spotted the main wreckage northwest of Cuddeback Lake. The aircraft was destroyed, and Adams was killed.|$|E
50|$|He has logged over 5,000 flight hours, {{more than}} 3,500 hours in jet aircraft, {{including}} flying as a <b>chase</b> <b>pilot</b> for Robert M. White's historic X-15 flight on July 17, 1962, in which White reached {{an altitude of}} 59.5 mi {{and became the first}} to be awarded Astronaut Wings based on the USAF definition of 50 mi.|$|E
5000|$|As air-to-air {{manoeuvres}} {{take the}} relative motion into play, many times gunshots fired {{directly at the}} target miss it due to the constant movement of the target, and the <b>chasing</b> <b>pilot</b> feels that the shot is late to reach the target; meanwhile, target has moved from that location.|$|R
50|$|Tony {{maneuvers}} {{the helicopter}} around the yacht allowing Chase to mow down gunmen firing at them, while Jack abseils {{onto the deck}} of the yacht.

50|$|Lead pursuit is {{the basis}} of all the dogfights since the World War II era. It {{describes}} when a <b>chasing</b> <b>pilot</b> has to gun down the bandit (or the target) it is following. It is the most common way of air-to-air dogfight where many a times pilots feel it to be the most natural way to hit a target.|$|R
50|$|Roosevelt {{stated that}} he flew 89 combat {{missions}} and 470 combat hours prior to being called back for his father's funeral in April 1945 (he {{did not return to}} active theaters). His decorations included the Distinguished Flying Cross. He also received the Order of the British Empire, the Croix de Guerre and Legion d'Honneur, the Moroccan Order of Ouissam Alaouite, and the U.S. Legion of Merit. He ended the war holding the Air Medal with reportedly eleven clusters. As a <b>chase</b> <b>pilot</b> for the Operation Aphrodite flights in 1944, Roosevelt said he witnessed the death of Joseph P.

5000|$|In the NASA 1 control room, {{there was}} no way to monitor the heading of the aircraft, so the {{situation}} was unknown to the engineers monitoring the flight. Normal conversation continued between Knight and Adams, with Knight advising Adams that he was [...] "a little bit high," [...] but in [...] "real good shape." [...] Adams radioed that the aircraft [...] "seemed squirrelly," [...] and moments later repeatedly told Knight that he had entered a spin. The ground controllers sought to get the X-15 straightened out, but {{there was no}} recommended spin recovery technique for the X-15, and engineers knew nothing about the aircraft's supersonic spin tendencies. The <b>chase</b> <b>pilots,</b> realizing that the X-15 would never make Rogers Dry Lake, headed for the emergency lakes, Ballarat and Cuddeback, in case Adams attempted an emergency landing.|$|R

The series premiered on September 20, 2010 to 7.31 million viewers and mixed reviews from critics. The series did not return for a second season due to low ratings. In September 2010, Metcalfe starred as Noah McManus in Hallmark movie Fairfield Road alongside Natalie Lisinska.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} this {{accident}} remains controversial. Theories include: the Tu-144 climbed to avoid a French Mirage <b>chase</b> plane whose <b>pilot</b> was attempting to photograph it; that changes {{had been made by}} the ground engineering team to the auto-stabilisation circuits to allow the Tu-144 to outperform the Concorde in the display circuit; and that the crew were attempting a manoeuvre and to outshine the Concorde.|$|R
5|$|On {{his first}} day at Edwards, Armstrong was tasked his first assignments, which were to <b>pilot</b> <b>chase</b> planes during {{releases}} of experimental aircraft from modified bombers. He also flew the modified bombers, and {{on one of these}} missions had his first flight incident at Edwards. On March 22, 1956, Armstrong was in a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which was to air-drop a Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket. He sat in the right-hand pilot seat while the left-hand seat commander, Stan Butchart, flew the B-29.|$|R
5000|$|BuNo 164584, 292 flights - {{crashed on}} January 19, 1995, north of Edwards AFB, California. The crash {{was caused by}} ice inside the pitot tube, sending {{incorrect}} airspeed data to the flight control computers. Contributing factors included the replacement of a heated pitot tube with an unheated Kiel probe, and ground crew/pilot ignorance of an option to override computer control. The pilot ejected safely. NASA issued in 2005 a film, [...] "X-31: Breaking the Chain," [...] reviewing the events. The novelty of the X-31 trials was computer control of its revolutionary flight controls (the canard wing and engine baffles) to effect manoeuvres impossible for conventional jet fighters. The film discusses at length the combination of independent errors (e.g. that the accompanying <b>chase</b> <b>pilot</b> could not hear the test pilots radio conversation with his base) in prompting loss of control, when the test pilot (correctly) ejected to save his life. Film of the crash shows the aircraft in unusual attitudes as the computer applied its false data to attempt to control flight after the pilot ejected.|$|E
5000|$|Nagel {{became a}} NASA {{astronaut}} in August 1979.

50|$|In {{his book}} Aces Wild: The Race for Mach 1 (1998), fellow North American test pilot Al Blackburn speculates that Welch may {{have broken the}} sound barrier two weeks before Yeager in an early flight of the XP-86 prototype. Welch himself never made that claim. Blackburn based his {{contention}} on interviews of eyewitnesses, former North American employees and access to contemporary historical accounts. Robert Kempel, author of The Race For Mach 1 contradicts the claim, contending {{it was impossible for}} Welch's aircraft to break the sound barrier with an underpowered engine. He notes that the XP-86 airframe was capable of transonic flight, but the interim low-power J35-C-3 limited its performance. The late Bob Hoover, <b>chase</b> <b>pilot</b> for Welch and Yeager, had also disputed the Welch story, stating that Welch was not flying that day because his plane was being repaired. The highest Mach number reached by Welch in 1947, as indicated by official flight test records, was about 0.93, in a maximum power dive from 45114 ft with the engine at 100.8-percent Military RPM (i.e. maximum power). North American conducted this test, their “High Mach Number Investigation”, on November 13. The USAF verified all North American results and this test Mach number in their own Phase II tests conducted in December 1947.|$|E

25|$|NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center (formerly the Dryden Flight Research Center) at Edwards, California has {{operated}} two T-34C aircraft. The first aircraft was previously flown at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, {{where it was}} used for propulsion experiments involving turboprop engines. In 1996 this aircraft was moved Dryden as a chase aircraft. That aircraft was returned to the U.S. Navy in 2002. The second T-34C was obtained in early 2005 from the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) at NAS Patuxent River, where {{it was due to}} be retired. At Armstrong, the T-34C is primarily used for <b>chasing</b> remotely <b>piloted</b> unmanned air vehicles which fly slower than NASA's F/A-18 mission support aircraft can fly. As a NASA mission support chase plane, the back seat would be occupied by a photographer or flight test engineer during research missions. It is also used for required pilot proficiency flying.|$|R
