25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise <b>control</b> <b>switch,</b> a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In <b>controlled</b> <b>switching</b> technology, an {{effective}} way to reduce transients produced by switching action, equipment failure preventions, and to inhance power quality, that is, already defined controlled strategies are to close and/or open each independent circuit breaker pole. <b>Controlled</b> <b>switching</b> of high voltage AC gas circuit breaker (GCB) and explains the <b>controlled</b> <b>switching</b> methods that are existing now a days is presented in this paper. Also the paper discusses the merits of <b>controlled</b> <b>switching</b> technology with an application. The accurate prediction of the operating time, subject to the various affecting parameters at that instant. Consistency of CB open and closing time is decides the success of CSS and reliability of CSW device to operate in high voltage environment system.

500|$|The typical GMAW {{welding gun}} {{has a number}} of key partsa <b>control</b> <b>switch,</b> a contact tip, a power cable, a gas nozzle, an {{electrode}} conduit and liner, and a gas hose. The <b>control</b> <b>switch,</b> or trigger, when pressed by the operator, initiates the wire feed, electric power, and the shielding gas flow, causing an electric arc to be struck. The contact tip, normally made of copper and sometimes chemically treated to reduce spatter, is connected to the welding power source through the power cable and transmits the electrical energy to the electrode while directing it to the weld area. [...] It must be firmly secured and properly sized, since it must allow the electrode to pass while maintaining electrical contact. On the way to the contact tip, the wire is protected and guided by the electrode conduit and liner, which help prevent buckling and maintain an uninterrupted wire feed. The gas nozzle directs the shielding gas evenly into the welding zone. Inconsistent flow may not adequately protect the weld area. Larger nozzles provide greater shielding gas flow, which is useful for high current welding operations that develop a larger molten weld pool. [...] A gas hose from the tanks of shielding gas supplies the gas to the nozzle. Sometimes, a water hose is also built into the welding gun, cooling the gun in high heat operations.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{models of}} Leslie {{speakers}} {{did not have}} the [...] "chorale" [...] setting. The <b>control</b> <b>switch</b> was simply a choice between [...] "off" [...] and [...] "tremolo". The first model of Leslie produced was the 30A. It emulated Hammond's DXR-20 tone cabinet, which used moving drums but only produced amplitude modulation, not frequency modulation. It contained a [...] drum and the power amplifier was housed {{in the top of the}} unit, to allow easy repair. This was superseded between 1947 and 1949 by the 31H, also known as the [...] "Tall Boy". It was similar in appearance to the 30A, but contained additional louvres along the top of the cabinet. Also, reflectors were placed on the end of the horn, to allow the treble signal to exit the unit through the sides, rather than on the top.|$|E

40|$|A Distributed Switch {{is a set}} of FCDFs {{associated}} with at least one <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch,</b> that <b>controls</b> the operations of the set of FCDFs. Figure 42 shows an example of Distributed Switch composed of a <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> and two FCDFs. From an external point of view (i. e., outside the dotted and dashed black line in figure 42), a Distribut-ed Switch behaves as a Fibre Channel Switch. In particular, a Distributed Switch supports the instan-tiation of N_Port to F_Port links and of E_Port to E_Port links (ISLs). N_Port to F_Port links are supported by both FCDFs and <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switches,</b> while ISLs are supported only by <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switches.</b> This means {{that it is possible to}} connect a Distributed Switch to another Switch only through a <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch,</b> not through an FCDF. From an internal point of view (i. e., inside the dotted and dashed black line in figure 42), A_Port to A_Port links (ASLs) enable FC frames forwarding between <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> and FCDFs, as well as between FCDFs. ASLs are also used to exchange control information between <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> and FCDFs. The <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> uses one or more Virtual Domain_IDs Domain_ID to perform N_Port_ID allo-cations for N_Ports connected to the FCDF Set FCDFs of the Distributed Switch (i. e., a Virtual Domain_ID is used as the most significant byte in the N_Port_IDs allocated to N_Ports that are at-tached to an FCDF of the FCDF SetDistributed <b>Switch).</b> The <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> uses also another Domain_ID, called Principal Domain, for its normal functions as a Fibre Channel Switch. As a result, a Distributed Switch such as the one shown in figure 42 uses at least two Domain_IDs: one for the Principal Domain and one or more for the Virtual Domain. To properly support the operations of a Vir...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an H-bridge {{inverter}} topology {{with reduced}} switch count technique is introduced. This technique reduces {{the number of}} <b>controlled</b> <b>switches</b> used in conventional multilevel inverter.

A multi conversion cell consists of three equal voltage sources with three <b>controlled</b> <b>switches</b> and three diodes. In conventional method, twelve <b>controlled</b> <b>switches</b> are used to obtain seven levels. Due to involvement of twelve switches the harmonics, switching losses, cost and total harmonic distortion are increased.

40|$|Abstract- A new carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) - based <b>controlled</b> <b>switch</b> is introduced. The new CNT device {{is a field}} emission – based device that uses field electron emission from the CNT to implement the functionality of <b>controlled</b> <b>switching.</b> To implement the field emission CNT <b>controlled</b> <b>switch,</b> four field emission CNTs that have single {{carbon nanotube}}s as the emitters were tested; two with single-walled CNT and two with multi-walled CNT. A tube with a tungsten tip was also used for comparison. The Fowler-Nordheim analysis of the DC currentvoltage data provided reasonable values for the local fields at the emitters and the sizes of the emitters. It is also shown within the new implementation of the <b>controlled</b> <b>switch</b> that squarewave pulses from a single laser diode with 20 mW power and 658 nm wavelength which is focused on each emitter increased the emitted current by 5. 2 % with the CNT and 0. 19 % with the compared tungsten tip. The extension of the new device from the two-valued to the general m-valued case is introduced, and the implementation of multiple-valued Galois circuits and systems utilizing the new CNT field emission – based device is also shown. Since the <b>controlled</b> <b>switch</b> is a basic block {{in the design of}} modern digital systems, the new CNT device can have a wide range of applications {{in a wide variety of}} nano circuits...|$|R
