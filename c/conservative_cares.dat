40|$|Objective: General {{practitioners}} refer {{patients with}} continued neck pain {{that do not}} respond well to <b>conservative</b> <b>care</b> frequently to secondary care for further assessment. Are surgical interventions to the cervical spine effective when compared to <b>conservative</b> <b>care</b> for patients with neck pain? Design: Systematic review. Method: The search strategy outlined by the Cochrane Back Review Group (CBRG) was followed. The primary search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and PEDro up to June 2011. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of adults with neck pain, which evaluated at least one clinically relevant primary outcome measure (e. g. pain, functional status, recovery), were included. In addition, treatments had to include surgery and <b>conservative</b> <b>care.</b> Two authors independently assessed risk of bias using the criteria recommended by the CBRG and extracted the data. The quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE method. Results: Patients included had neck pain with or without radiculopathy or myelopathy. In total, three RCTs and six CCTs were identified comparing different surgical interventions with <b>conservative</b> <b>care,</b> of which one had a low risk of bias. Overall there is very low quality of evidence available {{on the effectiveness of}} surgery compared to <b>conservative</b> <b>care</b> in neck pain patients showing overall no differences.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether the faster recovery after early surgery for sciatica compared with prolonged <b>conservative</b> <b>care</b> is attained at reasonable costs. Design: Cost utility analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial. Setting: Nine Dutch hospitals. Participants: 283 patients with sciatica for 6 - 12 weeks, caused by lumbar disc herniation. Interventions: Six months of prolonged <b>conservative</b> <b>care</b> compared with early surgery. Main outcome measures: Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) at one year and societal costs, estimated from patient reported utilities (UK and US EuroQol, SF- 6 D, and visual analogue scale) and diaries on costs (healthcare, patient's costs, and productivity). Results: Compared with prolonged <b>conservative</b> <b>care,</b> early surgery provided faster recovery, with a gain in QALYs according to the UK EuroQol of 0. 044 (95 % confidence interval 0. 005 to 0. 083), the US EuroQol of 0. 032 (0. 005 to 0. 059), the SF- 6 D of 0. 024 (0. 003 to 0. 046), and the visual analogue scale of 0. 032 (- 0. 003 to 0. 066). From the healthcare perspective, early surgery resulted in higher costs (difference euro 1819 (pound 1449; $ 2832), 95 % confidence interval euro 842 to euro 2790), with a cost utility ratio per QALY of euro 41 000 (euro 14, 000 to euro 430 000). From the societal perspective, savings on productivity costs led to a negligible total difference in cost (euro- 12, euro- 4029 to euro 4006). Conclusions: Faster recovery from sciatica makes early surgery likely to be cost effective compared with prolonged <b>conservative</b> <b>care.</b> The estimated difference in healthcare costs was acceptable and was compensated for by the difference in absenteeism from work. For a willingness to pay of euro 40, 000 or more per QALY, early surgery need not be withheld for economic reasons. Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 26872154...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: To explore the effectiveness of surgery vs conservative treatment, and conservative interventions for spinal stenosis. DATA SOURCES: Medline, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro and Cochrane databases, {{as well as the}} reference lists of retrieved studies. STUDY SELECTION: The search included non-English studies, and all conservative interventions were included. STUDY APPRAISAL: The PEDro scale was used to assess quality, and levels of evidence were used to synthesise studies where possible. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria, and 18 were high-quality studies. Decompression surgery was more effective than <b>conservative</b> <b>care</b> in four out of five studies, but only one of these was of high quality. In six high-quality studies, there was strong evidence that steroid epidural injections were not effective; in four out of five studies (two of which were of high quality), there was moderate evidence that calcitonin was not effective.

The higher medical costs of early surgery were fully compensated by quick resumption of working capacity.

Methods We will conduct a multicentre, pragmatic, assessor-blinded, two parallel arm, RCT comparing arthroscopic surgery to physiotherapy-led best <b>conservative</b> <b>care.</b> 24 hospitals treating NHS patients will recruit 344 patients over a 26 -month recruitment period. Symptomatic adults with radiographic signs of FAI morphology who are considered suitable for arthroscopic surgery by their surgeon will be eligible.

Design: A sequential exploratory mixed methods design was adopted for this study. The {{first phase of the}} study will involve fundamental qualitative description and the second phase will be a cross-sectional population-based survey. Setting: The research is conducted in Alberta, Canada. Participants: The participants are primary care physicians with experience in providing care for older adults with stage 5 CKD not planning on initiating dialysis. Methods: The first objective will be achieved by undertaking interviews with primary care physicians from southern Alberta. Participants will be selected purposively to include physicians with a range of characteristics (e. g., age, gender, and location of clinical practice). Interviews will be recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using conventional content analysis to generate themes.

The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of raloxifene, alendronate and <b>conservative</b> <b>care</b> in this population. Methods We developed a microsimulation model to assess the incremental cost and effectiveness of raloxifene and alendronate relative to <b>conservative</b> <b>care.</b> We assumed a societal perspective and a lifetime time horizon. We examined clinical scenarios involving postmenopausal women from 55 to 75 years of age with bone mineral density T-scores ranging from - 1. 0 to - 2. 4. Modeled health events included vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, invasive breast cancer, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Raloxifene and alendronate were assumed to reduce the incidence of vertebral but not nonvertebral fractures; raloxifene was assumed to decrease the incidence of breast cancer and increase the incidence of VTEs. Cost-effectiveness is reported in $/QALYs gained. Results For women 55 to 60 years of age with a T-score of - 1. 8, raloxifene cost approximately $ 50, 000 /QALY gained relative to <b>conservative</b> <b>care.</b> Raloxifene was less cost-effective for women 65 and older. At all ages, alendronate was both more expensive and less effective than raloxifene. In most clinical scenarios, raloxifene conferred a greater benefit (in QALYs) from prevention of invasive breast cancer than from fracture prevention. Results were most sensitive to the population's underlying risk of fracture and breast cancer, assumed efficacy and costs of treatment, and the discount rate. Conclusion For 55 and 60 year old women with osteopenia, treatment with raloxifene compares favorably to interventions accepted as cost-effective. </p...|$|R

40|$|ACKGROUND: Femoroacetabular {{impingement}} (FAI) is a syndrome of hip or groin pain {{associated with}} shape abnormalities {{of the hip}} joint. Treatments include arthroscopic surgery and <b>conservative</b> <b>care.</b> This study explored the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial to compare these treatments. OBJECTIVES: The objectives {{of this study were}} to estimate the number of patients available for a full randomised controlled trial (RCT); to explore clinician and patient willingness to participate in such a RCT; to develop consensus on eligibility criteria, surgical and best <b>conservative</b> <b>care</b> protocols; to examine possible outcome measures and estimate the sample size for a full RCT; and to develop trial procedures and estimate recruitment and follow-up rates. METHODS: Pre-pilot work: we surveyed all UK NHS hospital trusts (n[*]=[*] 197) to identify all FAI surgeons and to estimate how much arthroscopic FAI surgery they performed. We interviewed a purposive sample of 18 patients, 36 physiotherapists, 18 surgeons and two sports physicians to explore attitudes towards a RCT and used consensus-building methods among them to develop treatment protocols and patient information. Pilot RCT: we performed a pilot RCT in 10 hospital trusts. Patients were randomised to receive either hip arthroscopy or best <b>conservative</b> <b>care</b> and then followed up at 3, 6 and 12 months using patient-reported questionnaires for hip pain and function, activity level, quality of life, and a resource-use questionnaire. Qualitative recruitment intervention: we performed semistructured interviews with all researchers and clinicians involved in the pilot RCT in eight hospital trusts and recorded and analysed diagnostic and recruitment consultations with eligible patients. RESULTS: We identified 120 surgeons who reported treating at least 1908 patients with FAI by hip arthroscopy in the NHS in the financial year 2011 / 12. There were 34 hospital trusts that performed ≥[*] 20 arthroscopic FAI operations in the year.

40|$|Background: Cervical radicular {{syndrome}} (CRS) {{due to a}} {{herniated disc}} can be safely treated by surgical decompression of the spinal root. In {{the vast majority of}} cases this relieves pain in the arm and restores function. However, conservative treatment also has a high chance on relieving symptoms. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the (cost-) effectiveness of surgery versus prolonged <b>conservative</b> <b>care</b> during one year of follow-up, and to evaluate the timing of surgery. Predisposing factors in favour of one of the two treatments will be evaluated. Methods/design. Patients with disabling radicular arm pain, suffering for at least 2 months, and an MRI-proven herniated cervical disc will be randomised to receive either surgery or prolonged <b>conservative</b> <b>care</b> with surgery if needed. The surgical intervention will be an anterior discectomy or a posterior foraminotomy that is carried out according to usual care. Surgery will take place within 2 - 4 weeks after randomisation. <b>Conservative</b> <b>care</b> starts immediately after randomisation. The primary outcome measure is the VAS for pain or tingling sensations in the arm one year after randomisation. In addition, timing of surgery will be studied by correlating the primary outcome to the duration of symptoms. Secondary outcome measures encompass quality of life, costs and perceived recovery. Predefined prognostic factors will be evaluated. The total follow-up period will cover two years. A sample size of 400 patients is needed. Statistical analysis will be performed using a linear mixed model which will be based on the 'intention to treat' principle.

Despite considerable limitations in the medical, nursing, and laboratory facilities available a very low mortality rate was achieved by practising intensive supportive and <b>conservative</b> <b>care,</b> supplemented on occasion by a forced alkaline diuresis...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT – <b>Conservative</b> <b>care</b> {{is one of}} the fastest-changing {{areas of}} renal medicine. Non-dialytic therapy is now estab-lished as a {{treatment}} option in most renal units in the UK. This conference reviewed the history of conservative management and examined the state of current practice. The challenges now faced include expanding the evidence base in this area, improving the information given to patients and their families to help them make a decision about treatment, and responding to changes in NHS funding to ensure continued provision of high-quality care...|$|R
40|$|Surgery within 24 {{hours of}} hip {{fracture}} {{is a critical}} step in reducing complications, and may decrease mortality compared with <b>conservative</b> <b>care</b> (strength of recommendation [SOR]: B, cohort studies). Give patients heparin {{at the time of}} admission to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) (SOR: A, systematic reviews of RCTs). Anticoagulation should be continued in some form for 10 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory (SOR: A). Patients should also get prophylactic antibiotics in the 2 hours before surgery (SOR: A, meta-analysis of RCT) ...|$|R

Prospective observational trials following the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) criteria for bracing studies and the SOSORT management criteria, can give other evidence on the effectiveness of bracing in AIS. The Sforzesco brace has been used in worse curves, and its efficacy compared to casting Purpose The goal {{of this study was to}} check the effectiveness of the Sforzesco brace in AIS treatment according to the SRS and SOSORT criteria...|$|R
40|$|Anal fissure {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{anorectal}} problems. Anal fissure is largely associated with high anal sphincter pressures and most treatment options are based on reducing anal pressures. Conservative management, using increased fiber and warm baths, results in healing of approximately half of all anal fissures. In fissures that fail <b>conservative</b> <b>care,</b> various pharmacologic and surgical options offer satisfactory cure rates. Lateral internal sphincterotomy remains the gold standard for definitive management of anal fissure. This review outlines the key points in the presentation, pathophysiology, and management of anal fissure...|$|R
2500|$|Even for {{full-thickness}} {{rotator cuff}} tears, <b>conservative</b> <b>care</b> (i.e., nonsurgical treatment) outcomes are usually reasonably good. However, many patients still suffer disability and pain despite nonsurgical therapies. [...] For massive tears of the rotator cuff, surgery has shown durable outcomes on 10-year follow-up. However, {{the same study}} demonstrated ongoing and progressive fatty atrophy and repeat tears of the rotator cuff. [...] MRI evidence of fatty atrophy in the rotator cuff prior to surgery is predicative of a poor surgical outcome. If the rotator cuff is completely torn, surgery is usually required to reattach the tendon to the bone.|$|R
