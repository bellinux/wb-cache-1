50|$|In 1980 {{only about}} 10% on {{municipal}} solid waste was recycled, and the product consisted largely of paper and glass recycled material. With {{the widespread use of}} autoclaves, that percentage climbed to a significant 45% by the year 2000, when composting and energy recovery became more common. With the evolution of the autoclave and the arrival of converters new uses of <b>converted</b> <b>product</b> are emerging on an ongoing basis. Some application only recently implemented are: Composting and combining with farm fertilizer, building material such as concrete additive, gasification fuel, and furnace/boiler pellet additive. The latter two are energy recovery options that only became acceptable on a large scale once the product was demonstrated to burn cleanly and within EPA emission regulations. A notable fact about energy recovery is that even though some waste was already reused in this way as early as 1980, the current generation of converters produces Biomass Fuel that burns exponentially cleaner than the incinerated waste of those times.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} ability of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in {{transforming}} 6 -deoxypseudoanisatin. Methods: The experiment was performed by incubating 6 -deoxypseudoanisatin with the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 under continuous white light at 30 °C for 5 days. The crude <b>converted</b> <b>product</b> was detected using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and further analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as well as HPLC with electron spray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS). Results: TLC results showed that 6 -deoxypseudoanisatin was converted into a less polar product. HPLC and MS data indicated that the retention time of the <b>converted</b> <b>product</b> increased {{in comparison with the}} standard of 6 -deoxypseudoanisatin. Conclusion: Thus, the study appears to demonstrate that Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 can transform 6 -deoxypseudoanisatin.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} nature of the {{nonlinearities}} in an anti-parallel combination of Schottky diodes, which is often used as a frequency converting device or a mixer. An anti-parallel Schottky diode pair mixer requires only half the local oscillator frequency. The mixing terms of utmost importance are, the wanted fundamental frequency <b>converted</b> <b>product,</b> the unwanted third-order frequency <b>converted</b> <b>product</b> and the breakthrough of the local oscillator signal. This work aims to discover how the nonlinearities inside the mixer can affect the generation of unwanted products. Frequency upconversion measurements of an anti-parallel diode pair mixer, fabricated on WIN semiconductor's 0. 15 Âµm low-noise process have been used to extract a polynomial model of the mixer nonlinearities. The polynomial function representing nonlinear resistance contains only odd-power terms and a second polynomial function encapsulating capacitance and its asymmetry comprises of both even and odd-power terms. The coefficients of the model are extracted by fitting to measured amplitudes of the third-order mixing products and the local oscillator breakthrough over a range of the local oscillator drive powers, commonly encountered in practise. The model so extracted is validated by comparing its predictions with measured amplitudes of wanted and unwanted frequency products, as functions of local oscillator power at various local oscillator frequencies. The form of the polynomial model indicates the dominance of nonlinear resistance in the generation of the unwanted third-order mixing products. It also points to asymmetry of the capacitance-voltage characteristic as a possible reason behind unwanted local oscillator breakthrough in anti-parallel diode pair mixers. 8 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Background: Although {{increased}} levels of plasminogen activators {{have been found in}} psoriatic lesions, the role of plasmin converted from plasminogen by plasminogen activators in pathogenesis of psoriasis has not been investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we examined the contribution of plasmin to amplification of inflammation in patients with psoriasis. We found that plasminogen was diminished, but that the amount and activity of its <b>converted</b> <b>product</b> plasmin were markedly increased in psoriasis. Moreover, annexin II, a receptor for plasmin was dramatically increased in both dermis and epidermis in psoriasis. Plasmin at sites of inflammation was pro-inflammatory, eliciting production of inflammatory factors, including CC chemokine ligand 20 (CCL 20) and interleukin- 23 (IL- 23), that was mediated by the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) signaling pathway and that had an essential role in the recruitment and activation of pathogenic C-C chemokine receptor type 6 (CCR 6) + T cells. Moreover, intradermal injection of plasmin or plasmin together with recombinant monocyte/macrophage chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) resulted in induction of psoriasiform skin inflammation around the injection sites with several aspects of human psoriasis in mice. Conclusions/Significance: Plasmin converted from plasminogen by plasminogen activators plays an essential role in amplification of psoriasiform skin inflammation in mice, and targeting plasmin receptor- annexin II- may harbor therapeuti...|$|E

40|$|The {{proposed}} "catalytic membrane sensor" (CMS) {{was developed}} to generate a device which would selectively identify a specific reagent in a complex mixture of gases. This was to be accomplished by modifying an existing Hz sensor {{with a series of}} thin films. Through selectively sieving the desired component from a complex mixture and identifying it by decomposing it into Hz (and other by-products), a Hz sensor could then be used to detect the presence of the select component. The proposed "sandwich-type" modifications involved the deposition of a catalyst layered between two size selective sol-gel layers on a Pd/Ni resistive Hz sensor. The role of the catalyst was to convert organic materials to Hz and organic by-products. The role of the membraneo was to impart both chemical specificity by molecukir sieving of the analyte and <b>converted</b> <b>product</b> streams, as well as controlling access to the underlying Pd/Ni sensor. Ultimately, an array of these CMS elements encompassing different catalysts and membranes were to be developed which would enable improved selectivity and specificity from a compiex mixture of organic gases via pattern recognition methodologies.

The present work describes the bioconversion of phytosterols to androst- 4 -ene- 3 17 -dione, a key intermediate for the production of steroidal drugs and hormones. Since, phytosterols are insoluble in an aqueous medium, efforts are done to increase the bioavailability using some organic solvents as dispersing agent, and the biotransformation was catalyzed by Mycobacterium fortuitum subsp. fortuitum NCIM 5239, a mutant obtained at Devi Ahilya University, Indore. Methods: Bioconversion reactions were carried out in triplicate shake flask culture. Some water miscible and water immiscible solvents were used as dispersing agents, and a solution of phytosterols in solvents was added prior to autoclaving. The analysis of <b>converted</b> <b>product</b> was done by quantitative thin layer chromatography. Results: When compared to the bioconversion recorded with micronized phytosterols as a control for substrate addition, increased bioconversion was observed by ethanol as dispersing agent at a concentration of 4 ml per 0. 3 % substrate. Conclusion: Dispersing agents dispersed the phytosterol particles, thereby increasing the bioavailability to the bacterial cells in the medium.

Chemical analysis showed that the molar ratio of Zn(II) /Fe in Zn(II) doped FeOOH sample was only 0. 038 when this ratio was 0. 5 in an initial reaction Solution.

Characterization was carried out using instrumental techniques such as SEM, FT-IR, XRD and magnetization characterization.
