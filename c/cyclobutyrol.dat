40|$|The {{effects of}} sodium cyclobutyrate, a {{synthetic}} hydrocholeretic drug, on biliary lipid secretion {{and on the}} biliary outputs of several plasma-membrane enzymes were investigated in anaesthetized rats. Administration of a single oral dose of <b>cyclobutyrol</b> (0. 72 mmol/kg body wt.) reduced biliary concentration and output of cholesterol and phospholipid. However, bile acid secretion was not significantly modified. This uncoupling effect of lipid secretion remained even when the choleretic response to the drug had ceased. It additionally led to a statistically significant decrease in the cholesterol/bile acid and phospholipid/bile acid molar ratios and in the lithogenic index of the bile. The biliary outputs of the plasma-membrane enzymes alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase were markedly reduced by the drug. When <b>cyclobutyrol</b> was administered to rats which had been previously fed with a high-cholesterol diet, the effects of <b>cyclobutyrol</b> persisted, but were less marked. Our results demonstrate that the bile acid-independent choleresis induced by <b>cyclobutyrol</b> (related to its pharmacokinetic effect) {{is accompanied by a}} pharmacodynamic action that selectively reduces the secretion of biliary lipids. This is due to an uncoupling of the secretion of cholesterol and phospholipids from that of bile acids. Possible explanations for the biliary response to <b>cyclobutyrol</b> are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} organic anions {{are known to}} {{decrease}} biliary secretion of cholesterol and phospholipid without affecting bile acid secretion. <b>Cyclobutyrol</b> (CB) is a choleretic agent which also inhibits biliary lipid secretion. Using isolated perfused rat liver we have studied this inhibition in relation to possible mechanisms suggested for other anions. Shortly after its administration to the isolated perfused liver, CB decreases biliary outputs of cholesterol and phospholipid, without changes in bile acid secretion, at low (450 nmol/min), high (1350 nmol/min) and nil taurocholate infusion rates. The absolute inhibition {{does not appear to}} be decreased by elevated bile acid secretion. There is a differential effect on secretion of cholesterol and phospholipid, more marked at low bile acid secretion rates. Biliary outputs of the canalicular membrane enzymes 5 '-nucleotidase and alkaline phosphodiesterase I are also depressed by CB administration, but the anion does not affect the biliary output of bovine serum albumin or the output of rat serum albumin into the perfusion fluid. Since CB does not inhibit intracellular vesicular transport or apparently inhibit intracanalicular events, its effect is different from the effect of several other anions. From these studies it appears that the most likely effect of CB is exerted at the level of the canalicular membrane...|$|E
