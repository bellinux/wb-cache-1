500|$|... "Give It 2 Me" [...] {{is written}} as a self-manifesto song. Lyrically, though the song {{appears to be}} about dancing and sex, in reality Madonna uses sarcasm to {{emphasize}} the longevity of her career. The lyrics explain {{that she does not}} want to retire from her career at that moment and possesses the ability to continue, as noted in the lines [...] "Don't stop me now, no need to <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> I can {{go on and on and}} on." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{waited to}} <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> and {{expected}} some such outburst as managers usually get from criticized players. But not a word! Then I addressed {{some of them}} personally.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--I fancy {{there is}} {{something}} amiss. I can't move my arms; and I <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath.</b> My legs are all right if I could {{get away from this}} accursed brute." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was a most}} lovely day now, {{and bright}} and sunshiny; and the further and further we went over the hills towards the prairie the lovelier and lovelier the trees and flowers got to be and the more it seemed strange and somehow wrong that {{there had to be}} trouble in such a world as this. And {{then all of a sudden}} I <b>catched</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> and grabbed Tom's arm, and all my livers and lungs and things fell down into my legs.|$|R
60|$|My mother screamed, {{and down}} came my father's pipe {{on to the}} hearthrug. I had sprung round with a <b>catch</b> of <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and there was the}} valet, Ambrose, his body {{in the shadow of the}} doorway, his dark face {{protruded}} into the light, and two burning eyes fixed upon mine.|$|R
60|$|I joined him, and one {{whiff of}} the air that came up from below made me <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> and gasp. I had inhaled sulphur. On the instant I forgot the Elsinore, the mutineers for'ard, {{everything}} save one thing.|$|E
60|$|I {{found the}} {{forecastle}} of the Spitfire {{a dark and}} rather unwholesome place. The ventilation was bad, {{and the smell of}} tar and oakum was so strong that for a moment I had to turn away to <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I {{paused to}} <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> and looked round on the grim, tired faces of my players. They made a stern group. The {{close of the}} season found them almost played out. What a hard chance it was, after their {{extraordinary}} efforts, to bring {{the issue of the}} pennant down to this last game! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With {{a growing}} sense of uneasiness I pushed my chair back. It caught the hearthrug, and in my efforts to {{disentangle}} it the screen fell over with a crash and in the flickering light of the fire I saw the face of the creature opposite. With a sharp <b>catch</b> of <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> I left <b>my</b> chair and stood with clenched fists beside it. Man or beast, which was it? The flame leaped up and then went out, and in the mere red glow of the fire it looked more devilish than before.|$|R
60|$|It dawned upon me {{presently}} {{that the}} campfire was much {{farther away than}} it appeared. Often it went out of sight behind trees. By degrees it grew larger and larger. Then I slowed down and approached more cautiously. Once when the trees obscured it I traveled some distance without getting {{a good view of}} it. Passing down into a little hollow I lost it again. When I climbed out I hauled up short with a sharp <b>catch</b> of <b>my</b> <b>breath.</b> There were several figures moving around the campfire. I had stumbled on a camp that surely was not Dick Leslie's.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{felt pretty}} cheap. But {{the thing to}} do, {{straight}} off, {{was to make a}} plan; and we done it. We would do up the paper again, just as it was, and slip in, very elaborate and soft, and lay it on the bunk again, and let on WE didn't know about any trick, and hadn't any idea he was a-laughing at us behind them bogus snores of his'n; and we would stick by him, and the first night we was ashore we would get him drunk and search him, and get the di'monds; and DO for him, too, if it warn't too risky. If we got the swag, we'd GOT to do for him, or he would hunt us down and do for us, sure. But I didn't have no real hope. I knowed we could get him drunk--he was always ready for that--but what's the good of it? You might search him a year and never find--Well, right there I <b>catched</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> and broke off my thought! For an idea went ripping through my head that tore my brains to rags--and land, but I felt gay and good! You see, I had had my boots off, to unswell my feet, and just then I took up one of them to put it on, and I catched a glimpse of the heel-bottom, and it just took <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> away. You remember about that puzzlesome little screwdriver?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was beaten}} and buffeted, smashed under {{by the great}} San Pablo whitecaps, and strangled by the hollow tide-rip waves which flung {{themselves}} into my eyes, nose, and mouth. Then the strange sucks would grip my legs and drag me under, to spout me up in some fierce boiling, where, even as I tried to <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> a great whitecap would crash down upon my head.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw me}} a line, which I made fast to the stern, {{and then he}} {{disappeared}} again. I thought this somewhat strange, but as the boat was a light one, I towed it in and hitched it to the wharf, when, to my great astonishment, there disembarked not Farrar, but Miss Trevor. She leaped lightly ashore and was gone before I could <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> while Farrar let down the sail and offered me a cigarette. I had learned a lesson in appearances.|$|E
6000|$|... "He said {{something}} about not seeing any squatters on the land, and then he shut up tight on that score. But he began to be flirty again. He got hold of Jose's bridle, and before I could <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> he said I was a peach, and {{that he wanted to}} make a date with me, that his name was Chase, that he owned a gold mine in Mexico. He said a lot more I didn't gather, but when he called me 'Dearie' I--well, I lost my temper.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{said not}} a word. He just crooked his long white {{finger to the}} guard at the door while the {{carriage}} steps were let down, and I skipped into the house, and they slammed {{the door in the}} crowd's face. '"You go there," [...] says a soldier, and shoves me into an empty room, where I <b>catched</b> <b>my</b> first <b>breath</b> since I'd left the barge. Presently I heard plates rattling next door--there were only folding doors between--and a cork drawn. [...] "I tell you," [...] some one shouts with his mouth full, [...] "it was all that sulky ass Sieyes' fault. Only my speech to the Five Hundred saved the situation." ...|$|R
6000|$|WELL, I <b>catched</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> {{and most}} fainted. Shut up on a wreck {{with such a}} gang as that! But it warn't no time to be sentimentering. We'd GOT to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves. So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was, too--seemed a week before {{we got to the}} stern. No sign of a boat. Jim said he didn't believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn't hardly any {{strength}} left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely see her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been aboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says: ...|$|R

60|$|It made me <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath.</b> My {{heart began}} to thump like a hammer. But there was silence now--silence absolute. All those noises ceased, {{and it was as}} if they had never been. Not a sound; the stillness grew oppressive; it was like a weight upon one. All faces were turned toward the door; and one could {{properly}} expect that, for most of the people there suddenly realized, no doubt, that they were about to see, in actual flesh and blood, what had been to them before only an embodied prodigy, a word, a phrase, a world-girdling Name.|$|E
60|$|It was {{an awful}} scene. It made me <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> as I gazed. I could hardly stand on my feet, so violent was {{the motion of the}} ship. But while I reeled to and fro, the sailors only laughed at me; and bade me look out that the ship did not fall overboard; and advised me to get a handspike, and hold it down hard in the weather-scuppers, to steady her wild motions. But I was now getting a little too wise for this foolish kind of talk; though all through the voyage, they never gave it over.|$|E
60|$|The absurd {{impulse to}} run out after Jacobus (for I had been startled, too) once repressed, I took a chair, placed it not very far from her, sat down deliberately, and {{began to talk about}} the garden, caring not what I said, but using a gentle caressing {{intonation}} as one talks to soothe a startled wild animal. I could not even be certain that she understood me. She never raised her face nor attempted to look my way. I kept on talking only to prevent her from taking flight. She had another of those quivering, repressed starts which made me <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> with apprehension.|$|E

40|$|I {{have always}} {{approached}} life like a head first dive off a waterfall. That unabashed spring {{into the unknown}} is what I believe drew me into the arts and placed me in the audition room for UCSD's Graduate Acting program. <b>Catching</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> from the expulsion of several aerobic monologues, Kyle Donnelly asked why grad school {{would be a good}} fit. I responded with, "I've got a nice set of skills, but I would like to craft and hone them, becoming an acting machine that can sustain a long life in theatre. " At that time the picture in my mind was much like a Terminator of acting, crushing and molding the world of the play into something beautiful to experience. Once in the program, my inner Peter Pan took flight, exploring the physical and emotional depths of a drag queen, an adolescent searching for love, a man sacrificing life and limb for family, and more. Along the way I waited for this Terminator to appear and replace the boyish, earnest glee with which I approach work and life. He never appeared. This frustrated me until, finally, I realized the image of this "machine" was all wrong. Little did I know my inner free spirit had been acquiring bits of armor, piece by piece, in the way of movement, voice, speech, text analysis and personal process in the work. My once exposed person is now shielded with technique and a stronger sense of self. The joyously unrestrained coupled with an impenetrable defense. I now am about to embark into a career where one must be simultaneously emotionally available and tough as nails. I am ready...|$|R

6000|$|The sun was gilding {{the rim of}} {{the desert}} rampart when we began the ascent of the foothills of Buckskin. A steep trail wound zigzag up the {{mountain}} We led our horses, as it was a long, hard climb. From time to time, as I stopped to <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> I gazed away across the growing void to the gorgeous Pink Cliffs, far above and beyond the red wall which had seemed so high, and then out toward the desert. The irregular ragged crack in the plain, apparently only a thread of broken ground, was the Grand Canyon. How unutterably remote, wild, grand was that world of red and brown, of purple pall, of vague outline! ...|$|E

"I haven't {{examined}} {{this one}} yet," [...] answered the Ork; [...] "but if {{they happen to}} be alike I shudder at our fate, for the other one was a prison, with no outlet except by means of the water. I stayed there all night, however, and this morning I plunged into the pool, as far down as I could go, and then swam as hard and as far as I could. The rocks scraped my back, now and then, and I barely escaped the clutches of an ugly sea-monster; but by and by I came to the surface to <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> and found myself here. That's the whole story, and as I see you have something to eat I entreat you to give me a share of it. The truth is, I'm half starved." ...|$|E

One little funny man leaped up like a wild monkey an' began to screech. An' in another second he was in the air upside down. When he lit, he laid there. Then, quicker'n I can tell you, the young man dove at Rojas. Like a mad steer on the rampage he charged Rojas an' his men. The whole outfit went down--smash! I figgered then what 'rush' meant. The young fellow came up out of the pile with Rojas, an' just like I'd sling an empty sack along the floor he sent the bandit. But swift as that went he was on top of Rojas before the chairs an' tables had stopped rollin'.|$|E

6000|$|I am {{now in a}} {{precarious}} position, riding {{the ends of the}} down-curving roofs of two cars at the same time. With a quick, tense movement, I transfer both legs to the curve of one roof and both hands to the curve of the other roof. Then, gripping the edge of that curving roof, I climb over the curve to the level roof above, where I sit down to <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> holding on the while to a ventilator that projects above the surface. I am on top of the train--on the [...] "decks," [...] as the tramps call it, and this process I have described is by them called [...] "decking her."

6000|$|Following that long-legged Arizonian on {{foot was}} almost as strenuous as keeping him in sight on horseback. I managed it. We climbed steep slopes and the farther we climbed the thicker grew the brush. Often we would halt to listen for hounds, at which welcome {{intervals}} I endeavored to <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath.</b> We kept the hounds in hearing, which fact incited us to renewed endeavors. At length we got into a belt of live-oak and scrub-pine brush, almost as difficult to penetrate as manzanita, and here we had to bend and crawl. Bear and deer tracks led everywhere. Small stones and large stones had been lifted and displaced by bears searching for grubs. These slopes were dry; we found no water at the heads of ravines, yet the red earth was rich in bearded, tufted grass, yellow daisies and purple asters, and a wan blue flower. We climbed and climbed, until my back began to give me trouble. [...] "Reckon we--bit off--a big hunk," [...] remarked Edd once, and I thought {{he referred to the}} endless steep and brushy slopes. By and bye the hounds came back to us one by one, all footsore and weary. Manifestly the bear had outrun them. Our best prospect then was to climb on to the rim and strike across the forest to camp.|$|E
60|$|But {{a change}} {{came over the}} face of the dream, for a dream I told myself it must be. My rhythm grew shorter and shorter. I was jerked from swing to counter swing with irritating haste. I could {{scarcely}} <b>catch</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> so fiercely was I impelled through the heavens. The gong thundered more frequently and more furiously. I grew to await it with a nameless dread. Then it seemed as though I were being dragged over rasping sands, white and hot in the sun. This gave place to a sense of intolerable anguish. My skin was scorching in the torment of fire. The gong clanged and knelled. The sparkling points of light flashed past me in an interminable stream, as though the whole sidereal system were dropping into the void. I gasped, caught my breath painfully, and opened my eyes. Two men were kneeling beside me, working over me. My mighty rhythm was the lift and forward plunge of a ship on the sea. The terrific gong was a frying-pan, hanging on the wall, that rattled and clattered with each leap of the ship. The rasping, scorching sands were a man’s hard hands chafing my naked chest. I squirmed under the pain of it, and half lifted my head. My chest was raw and red, and I could see tiny blood globules starting through the torn and inflamed cuticle.|$|E
