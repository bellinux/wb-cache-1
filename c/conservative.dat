5|$|For {{representation}} in Parliament Dorset {{is divided into}} eight Parliamentary constituencies—five county constituencies and three borough constituencies. At the 2017 general election, the <b>Conservative</b> Party was dominant, taking all eight seats. The borough constituencies of Bournemouth East, Bournemouth West and Poole are traditionally <b>Conservative</b> safe seats and are all represented by <b>Conservative</b> members of parliament. The county constituencies of North Dorset and Christchurch are also represented by <b>Conservative</b> MPs. West Dorset is represented by <b>Conservative</b> MP Oliver Letwin who was the Minister of State at the Cabinet Office in David Cameron's government. The marginal seat of South Dorset is represented by Richard Drax, who gained the seat from Labour representative, Jim Knight, in 2010. Drax retained the seat in 2015 and 2017. Mid Dorset and North Poole has been held by Liberal Democrat MP Annette Brooke who retained her seat in 2010 with a slim majority of 269 (0.6% of the vote) over the <b>Conservative</b> candidate. Since 2015 the constituency has been represented by the <b>Conservative</b> MP, Michael Tomlinson.

Fiscal <b>conservatives</b> express concern that higher budget deficits and debt damage confidence, reducing investment and spending. <b>Conservatives</b> argue for policies that reduce or lower inflation. <b>Conservatives</b> generally advocate supply-side economics.|$|R

5|$|In 1966, {{in one of}} {{the closest}} polls in UK history, Sir Harmar Nicholls held the seat by three votes after seven recounts. Nicholls was the <b>Conservative</b> member from 1950 to 1974, when he lost in the October {{election}} of that year to Labour's Michael Ward, having held on by just 22 votes after four recounts in the election eight months earlier. The growth in the New Town from 1967 may in part account for Labour's victory here in 1974. In 1979, however, Ward lost the seat to the <b>Conservative</b> Brian Mawhinney, who would represent Peterborough for the entire duration of the incoming <b>Conservative</b> government and was a Cabinet Minister and <b>Conservative</b> Party Chairman during the second Major government (1992–97).|$|E

5|$|Paul {{has been}} {{described}} as <b>conservative</b> and libertarian. According to University of Georgia political scientist Keith Poole, Paul had the most <b>conservative</b> voting record of any member of Congress from 1937 to 2002, and is the most <b>conservative</b> of the candidates that had sought the 2012 Republican nomination for president, on a scale primarily measuring positions on the role of government in managing the economy– not positions on social issues or foreign policy matters. Other analyses, in which key votes on domestic social issues and foreign policy factor more heavily, have judged Paul much more moderate. The National Journal, for instance, rated Paul only the 145th most <b>conservative</b> member of the House of Representatives (out of 435) based on votes cast in 2010.|$|E
