2500|$|Upon {{its first}} release in September 2008 Chromium {{was criticized for}} storing saved {{passwords}} in a manner so that any casual user of a computer can easily read them from the GUI. Chromium Users have filed many bug reports and feature requests asking for a master password option to access stored passwords, but Chromium developers have consistently insisted that this provides no real security against knowledgeable hackers. Users have argued that it would protect against co-workers or family members borrowing a computer and seeing the stored passwords in <b>clear</b> <b>text.</b> In December 2009, Chromium developer P. Kasting stated: [...] "A master password was issue 1397. That issue is closed. We will not implement a master password. Not now, not ever. Arguing for it won't make it happen.

2500|$|In this {{particular}} context, the expression [...] "Call of God" [...] (...) is a transparent, according to Christopher Buck, reference to Prophets of God and who give revelation. Scholars like Susan Maneck and William Collins have taken {{note of the}} strength of this quote. However the language is not specific. The Universal House of Justice notes that [...] "The Bahá’í Teachings do not explicitly confirm, nor do they rule out, the possibility that Messengers of God have appeared in the Americas. In the absence of a <b>clear</b> <b>Text</b> the Universal House of Justice has no basis for issuing the kind of statement you propose which would confirm, “in principle, that God sent Manifestations to the indigenous peoples of the Americas.”" [...] Nevertheless the figure of Deganawida, The Great Peacemaker, is mentioned as a leading example in scholarly research; others mentioned by individuals include Quetzalcoatl and Viracocha. David Ruhe, {{a former member of the}} Universal House of Justice, has written mentioning his own view of Deganawida as a Prophet. Since no individual or institution can add to Bahá'í scripture it is impossible to add a specific name to a list of accepted Manifestations of God that would be binding on all Bahá'ís and Bahá'í institutions. However individuals and institutions may accept for their own purposes that various cultural heroes may have been in fact a Manifestation of God and Bahá'ís and institutions of the religion can accept the fact that sacred Indian tradition has mentioned specific names for individuals acting in the role of a Prophet.|$|E

The MS-DOS dialects of BASIC written by Microsoft, BASICA and GW-BASIC, also have the CLS command as a BASIC keyword - as do various non-Microsoft implementations of BASIC such as BBC BASIC found on the BBC Micro computers.

The dataset is natural, simple and <b>clear.</b> <b>Texts</b> are sampled from daily newspapers. To collect naturally written handwriting, forms are dictated to writers. The {{current version of}} our dataset includes 154 paragraphs written by 48 writers. It contains more than 3800 words and more than 19, 400 characters. Handwritten texts are mainly written by researchers from different research centers. In order to use this dataset in a recognition system word extraction is needed. In this paper a new word extraction technique based on the Arabic handwriting cursive nature is also presented. The technique is applied to this dataset and good results are obtained. The results {{can be considered as}} a bench mark for future research to be compared with. Keywords—Arabic, Handwriting recognition, on-line dataset. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the impact on modular exponentiation of architectural features and possible concurrent gate execution. Various arithmetic algorithms are evaluated for execution time, potential concurrency, and space tradeoffs. We find that, to exponentiate an n-bit number, for storage space 100 n (twenty times the minimum 5 n), we can execute modular exponentiation two hundred to seven hundred times faster than optimized versions of the basic algorithms, depending on architecture, for n= 128. Addition on a neighbor-only architecture is limited to O(n) time when non-neighbor architectures can reach O(log n), demonstrating that physical characteristics of a computing device have an important impact on both real-world running time and asymptotic behavior. Our results will help guide experimental implementations of quantum algorithms and devices.

40|$|The ‘Storage Space’ project {{aimed to}} meet a number of {{repository}} needs that were identified at University College Falmouth. Initially it was proposed to address four main areas: 1. A location for digitized copyright <b>cleared</b> <b>texts</b> linked to the Institutional VLE 2. A storage location for Institutional course documents 3.

Key to the project was the intention to create ‘A single platform for all repository content regardless {{of the type of}} digital object and metadata type’. It was initially assumed that one of the standard IR packages such as Eprints of Dspace would be used as the platform to host the repository and adapted to meet local requirements. However, early in the project it was decided that Microsoft Sharepoint, should also be explored as its development was already being investigated as a key element of the institutional infrastructure...|$|R

50|$|Its {{text mode}} could display 80&times;25 text {{characters}} and was MDA-compatible. As such, it rendered {{characters in a}} box of 9&times;14 pixels, of which 7&times;11 made out the character itself (the other pixels being used for space between character columns and lines). This amounted to markedly <b>clearer</b> <b>text</b> display than the competing CGA adapter could offer. The total theoretical resolution of this text mode was 720&times;350 pixels. This number is arrived at through multiplying the character width of 9 pixels {{by the number of}} text columns possible on screen (80) as well as multiplying the character height of 14 pixels by the number of text lines (25). In the MDA-compatible text mode, however, these pixels were not individually addressable. The graphics mode simply made all pixels directly addressable. This translated to a resolution of not 720&times;350, but only 720&times;348 pixels (at 1 bit per pixel) because, for technical reasons (see below), the screen height had to be a multiple of four. Pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.55.|$|R
