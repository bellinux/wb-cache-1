40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the efficient execution of multiple sequence alignment methods in a multiple client environment. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a computationally expensive method, which is commonly used in <b>computational</b> and <b>molecular</b> <b>biology.</b> Large databases of protein and gene sequences are available to the scientific community. Oftentimes, these databases are accessed by multiple users to execute MSA queries. The data server has to handle multiple concurrent queries in such situations. We look at the effect of data caching on the performance of the data server. We describe an approach for caching intermediate results for reuse in subsequent or concurrent queries. We focus on progressive alignment-based strategies, in particular the CLUSTAL W algorithm. Our results for 350 sets of sequences show an average speedup of up to 2. 5 is obtained by caching intermediate results. Our results also show that the cache-enabled CLUSTAL W program scales well on a SMP machine. ...|$|R
40|$|Currently, a major <b>computational</b> {{problem in}} <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> is to {{identify}} genes in uncharacterized DNA sequences. The variation, complexity, and incompletely-understood nature of genes make it impractical to hand-code algorithms to recognize them. Machine learning methods [...] which are able to form their own descriptions of genetic concepts [...] offer a promising approach to this problem. This article surveys machine-learning approaches to identifying genes in DNA. We discuss two broad classes of gene-recognition approaches: search by signal and search by content. For both classes, we define the specific tasks that they address, describe how these tasks have been framed as machine-learning problems, and survey some of the machine-learning algorithms that have been applied to them...|$|R
40|$|Antibodies {{appear to}} be the first line of defence in the {{adaptive}} immune response of vertebrates and thereby are involved in a multitude of biochemical mechanisms, such as regulation of infection, autoimmunity, and cancer. It goes without saying that a full understanding of antibody function is required for the development of novel antibody-interacting drugs. These drugs are the Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs), which are a new type of targeted therapy, used for example for cancer. They consist of an antibody (or antibody fragment such as a single-chain variable fragment [scFv]) linked to a payload drug (often cytotoxic). Because of the targeting, the side effects should be lower and give a wider therapeutic window. Overall, the underlying principle of ADCs is to discern the delivery of a drug that is cytotoxic to a target that is cancerous, hoping to increase the antitumoural potency of the original drug by reducing adverse effects and side effects, such as toxicity of the cancer target. This is a pioneering field that employs state-of-the-art <b>computational</b> and <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> methods in the fight against cancer using ADCs...|$|R
