500|$|In 1981 the {{movement}} for Independence began, following the murder of [...] Pierre Declercq, {{the secretary general of}} the <b>Caledonian</b> <b>Union</b> (French: Union calédonienne, UC) on 19 September 1981. A national forum titled [...] "Front de Liberatoin Nationale Kanak Socialiste" [...] (FLNKS) was established in 1984. This forum refused to participate in elections to the Territorial Assembly and even declared its own Provincial Government; it met with opposition by the French. FLNKS [...] "organized a boycott of the territorial elections in New Caledonia, smashing ballot boxes and setting up roadblocks to prevent people from voting." [...] The FLNKS persisted with their agitation and unilaterally announced on 7 January 1985 that a referendum on independence would be conducted in July 1985. After the death of Kanak leader Eloi Machoro in 1985, Kanak activists took 27 gendarmes hostage on the island of Ouvéa, igniting a French response (see Ouvéa cave hostage taking).|$|E

50|$|The {{party has}} been divided since the early 1990s between the <b>Caledonian</b> <b>Union</b> and UNI, and, as a result, the two factions often run {{candidates}} and lists against each other and neither can agree on {{a leader of the}} FLNKS.

From 1956 to 1985 he was the first president of <b>Caledonian</b> <b>Union.</b> At the beginnings he was an autonomist, but later became an independentist. His brother, Raphaël also became a militarist independentist {{as the president of the}} South Pacific Society of Miners.

Raphaël Pidjot and other leaders of the organization died in 2000 in a helicopter accident.|$|E
5000|$|Palika {{started on}} the radical left, with Marxist rhetoric, in the 1970s. It participated, like the <b>Caledonian</b> <b>Union</b> (UC), in the Nationalist Front and later the FLNKS as the smaller, but more radical element. After the Matignon Accords, the {{division}} between Palika and UC heightened, and in 1995 Paul Néaoutyine led a dissident list (National Union for Independence, UNI) from the FLNKS' united list in the North Province. In 1999, the Palika and UC ran separate lists in all provinces. At the same time, the Palika became more moderate, favouring talks with loyalists but still having as a final goal full independence (as opposed to Free association supported by UC).|$|E

Both the UC and UNI are of approximately equal size, and with varying rhetoric. However, all support the independence of New Caledonia. The party boycotted the 1987 independence referendum.|$|E

He quickly climbed the political ladder steadily until 1981 when after the assassination of Pierre Declercq at his own house on 19 September 1981 Machoro had reached the position of UC's general secretary. As a Kanak nationalist, he wished that New Caledonia never will be like it was before.», and among participants of the party's central part he represented the most radical partisans of Socialist Kanak Independence movement.

5000|$|The LKS {{was founded}} by a split in the Party of Kanak Liberation (Palika) in 1981. The most radical members of Palika, which had been {{the base of the}} party since its creation, walked out criticizing the Palika's {{increasing}} moderation and increasing links with the metropolitan French Socialist Party (PS). Led by Nidoïsh Naisseline, a Marxist, it also refused to support Rock Pidjot of the <b>Caledonian</b> <b>Union</b> in the 1981 elections. However, the LKS moderated and it did not participate in the FLNKS-led electoral boycotts in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the party even started co-operating with the anti-independence Rally for Caledonia in the Republic (RPCR) in the Loyalty Islands. Thanks to this alliance, Nidoïsh Naisseline was president of the islands between 1995 and 1999. During this time, the LKS adopted a platform in favour of independence-association and started early negotiations with the loyalists while the FLNKS refused talks until a mining dispute in the North had been settled. The alliance with the RPCR ended in 2004, but the LKS has remained close to anti-independence parties, notably Future Together. In fact, Christiane Gambey, a member of Future Together, {{is also a member of}} the LKS.|$|E
