40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} of bioclimatic tolerance ranges of Quercus aucheri Jaub. et Spach. It is an endemic for Turkey and called as Boz pirnal oak in Turkish. In the determination of bioclimatic appropriateness, the methods of Emberger (Q 2; the humidity category, m; the winter variant) De Martonne (LDS: {{the length of the}} dry season) and Gaussen (DSWD: the dry season water deficit) were used. According to Emberger’s <b>climagram</b> method used by Quézel and Barbéro, the bioclimatic tolerance range of Boz Pirnal oak is remarkably large as it includes up to 8 different types of Mediterranean bioclimate. Therefore, the bioclimatic niche of the Boz Pirnal oak in Turkey is characterized by highly heterogeneous; cool-humid, cool-subhumid, cool-semiarid, temperate-humid, temperate-subhumid, temperate-semiarid, warm-humid and warm-subhumid...|$|E
