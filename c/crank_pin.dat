25|$|<b>Crank</b> <b>pin</b> and {{crosshead}} bearings carry small cup-shaped reservoirs for oil. These have {{feed pipes}} to the bearing surface that start above the normal fill level, or are kept closed by a loose-fitting pin, {{so that only}} when the locomotive is in motion does oil enter. In United Kingdom practice the cups are closed with simple corks, but these {{have a piece of}} porous cane pushed through them to admit air. It is customary for a small capsule of pungent oil (aniseed or garlic) to be incorporated in the bearing metal to warn if the lubrication fails and excess heating or wear occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Each engine had {{a single}} piston which {{measured}} 12 inches on the inside bore, and drove a piston rod with a stroke of 48 inches. [...] Each piston rod in turn drove a 16-foot-long iron rod called a pitman arm which turned a <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> on the sternwheel. [...] The sternwheel itself was 15 feet in diameter.|$|E
2500|$|During the Lady Elgin's career she was {{involved}} in numerous accidents. She sank and was repaired in 1854 after striking a rock at Manitowoc, Wisconsin. In 1855, she was towed to Chicago after an accident to her machinery. In 1857, she was damaged by fire. In June 1858, she struck a reef at Copper Harbor, Michigan. In August 1858, she was stranded on Au Sable Point Reef in Lake Superior. In October 1859, she was towed to Marquette, Michigan after breaking her crossbeam. In November 1859, she was towed again when her <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> broke near Point Iroquois, Michigan. Her final blow came in 1860 when she was rammed by the wooden schooner Augusta ten miles from shore. In 1899, Great Lakes historian J.B. Mansfield called the Lady Elgin's sinking [...] "one of the greatest marine horrors on record".|$|E
50|$|When {{describing}} a crankshaft design, {{the number of}} main bearings is generally quoted, {{as the number of}} <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> is determined by the engine configuration. For example, a crankshaft for an inline six engine will be described as three bearing or four bearing depending on its number of main bearings; The <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> are not counted in this description. Similarly, when speaking of a crankshaft, the journals are the main bearing journals only. The <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> are not normally called journals although they form the centre shafts of the big end bearings and are therefore journals in the more general sense.|$|R

50|$|Two motors were {{mounted in}} each bogie frame. The motors drove large cogwheels via {{spring-loaded}} sprockets on each side, and the cogwheels drove a jackshaft. The <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> of the jackshafts drove - via a coupling rod - the <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> {{of the two}} outer drive axles of the bogie. The inner side of this coupling rod contained a pin, which drove the <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> of the two inner drive axles via a second coupling rod. Because {{of the position of}} the motors, and therefore also the jackshaft, the coupling rods were offset slightly relative to the drive axles. From a maintenance point of view this kind of drive was cheaper than a complex split coupling rod, but during service it was considerably more bumpy. For this reason primarily, the locomotive was not used for high speed operation.|$|R

50|$|Unlike V-twins, straight-twin engines {{do not use}} {{a common}} <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> for both {{connecting}} rods, each cylinder has its own <b>crank</b> <b>pin.</b> Most vintage British straight-twin motorcycle engines, such as Triumph, BSA, Norton and Royal Enfield, had two main bearings, the exception being AJS/Matchless, which used a third, center main bearing.|$|E
5000|$|In a steam locomotive, the <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> {{are usually}} mounted {{directly}} {{on one or}} more pairs of driving wheels, and the axle of these wheels serves as the crankshaft. The connecting rods (also called the main rods in US practice), run between the <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> and crossheads, where they connect to the piston rods. Crossheads or trunk guides are also used on large diesel engines manufactured for marine service. (The similar rods between driving wheels are called side rods in US practice and coupling rods in British practice.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} Drummond tubes, the {{locomotives}} {{differed from the}} Class 8-L1 in a few particulars. Their coupling rods were [...] "H" [...] section instead of rectangular, while their <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> were slightly larger.|$|R
50|$|They had {{an outside}} frame, the drive was {{achieved}} using a mechanical, three-stage gear and a reverse gear unit. The axles were driven by connecting rods via a jackshaft. The Treibzapfen and <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> were located outside the frame.|$|R

5000|$|Note that typical 2-stroke V4s {{have four}} crank throws or pins (see below) {{so it is}} {{important}} to stipulate all four <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> phases with the two-stroke engines.

50|$|Two motors were {{mounted in}} both bogie frames. Those two motors drove big cogwheels over both-side {{spring-loaded}} sprockets. The big cogwheels drove a jackshaft. The jackshaft drove a slit coupling rod which drove - over a vertical crosshead - the <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> {{of the two}} drive-axles of the bogie.|$|R
5000|$|... 90° V6 {{sometimes}} {{were designed}} like chopping 2 cylinders off common V8 engines to share production tooling (e.g. General Motors 90° V6 engines up to 229 CID with 18° offset crankshaft and uneven firing interval), but newer examples (e.g. Honda Honda C engines that evolved from {{not having a}} balancer to the 3.5 liter version with a balance shaft) are dedicated designs with 30° offset <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> that result in even combustion spacing. Compared to 60° V6, the offset <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> could have overlap in {{the diameter of the}} pin, and the V angle coincides with the angle of mean directions of conrods swinging left and right in each bank. It also shares the four (4., 6., 14. and 16.) plane imbalances and the staggered cylinders, but there is the secondary balance advantage over inline 6 as well.|$|R
50|$|Crossplane {{crankshafts}} {{could be}} used in many cylinder configurations that have evenly-spaced firing, as long as the number of cylinders is a multiple of four in two-stroke engines, or a multiple of eight in 4 stroke engines. Unless the <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> have big-end phase-offset, the V-angle requirement must be met for evenly-spaced firing in V configurations as listed below.|$|R
5000|$|... the European {{version was}} {{equipped}} with the pre-production 75-degree <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> offset for smoother operation at high engine speeds.|$|E
50|$|V6 engines with un-split shared <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> {{can have}} equally spaced firing when the V-angle is at 120° (60° or 120° for 2-stroke). However, the 120° bank angle makes the engine rather wide, so {{production}} V6 {{tend to use}} 60° angle with a <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> that is offset 60° for the opposing cylinders. As offsetting the <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> {{for as much as}} 60° no longer provides overlap in the diameter of the <b>crank</b> <b>pin,</b> the actual pin is not really an offset 'split' pin, but normally is completely separate in two parts with a thin crank web connecting the two individual pins. This makes the crankshaft structurally weaker, much more so than in the crankshaft with slight offset seen on the Lancia Fulvia V4 with 10.5° to 13° offset, so racing V6 engines from Carlo Chiti-designed 1961 Ferrari 156 engine to Cosworth GBA for Formula One often used the 120° bank angle to avoid this weakness, unless required by the formula as in all the 2014 - 2015 Formula One 1.6 Liter turbo V6 engines that has 90° bank angle according to the regulation.|$|E

50|$|Typical {{two-stroke}} V4s {{have four}} crank throws, or <b>crank</b> <b>pins,</b> {{instead of the}} two that most four-stroke V4s have (two connecting rods sharing each pin). This is primarily because each piston needed its own sealed crankcase volume {{for the purposes of}} efficient induction, where in some cases separate crankshafts served each bank in order to achieve this.|$|R
50|$|Rather {{than the}} bar frame as specified, an outside plate frame {{was used to}} {{accommodate}} the inside cylinders. The connecting rods of the inside engine were not connected directly to the <b>crank</b> <b>pins,</b> but to projections on the coupling rods which actuated the rack gear. This method of coupling was unavoidable due to the restricted width of only 3 ft between tyres.|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} {{conformed to}} SAR requirements {{as far as}} practicable but also incorporated the latest American railway engineering practices. The engines introduced several features which were new to the SAR at the time, such as top feeds to the boiler, self-cleaning smokeboxes, Sellar's drifting valves, and grease lubrication to the coupled wheel axle boxes, <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> and connecting rod big ends.|$|R
50|$|Two motors were {{mounted in}} each bogie frame. They were located between {{the second and}} third drive-axle. The motors drove big cogwheels in the {{jackshaft}} over spring-loaded sprockets. The <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> of the jackshaft drove over inclined connecting rod a pin mounted on the triangle-shaped coupling rod which connected the first and the second drive-axle. This pin was located close to the <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> of the first drive-axle. A second coupling rod connected the second and the third drive-axles. This drive is known as Winterthurer Schrägstangenantrieb (Winterthur drive with inclined connecting rod).|$|E
50|$|The {{reason for}} the piston's higher speed during the 180° {{rotation}} from mid-stroke through top-dead-centre, and back to mid-stroke, is that the minor contribution to the piston's up/down movement from the connecting rod's change of angle here has {{the same direction as}} the major contribution to the piston's up/down movement from the up/down movement of the <b>crank</b> <b>pin.</b> By contrast, during the 180° rotation from mid-stroke through bottom-dead-centre and back to mid-stroke, the minor contribution to the piston's up/down movement from the connecting rod's change of angle has the opposite direction of the major contribution to the piston's up/down movement from the up/down movement of the <b>crank</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The term {{scotch yoke}} {{continues}} to be used when the slot in the yoke is shorter than {{the diameter of the}} circle made by the <b>crank</b> <b>pin.</b> For example, the side rods of a locomotive may have scotch yokes to permit vertical motion of intermediate driving axles.|$|E
5000|$|... 1206: Al-Jazari invented {{an early}} crankshaft, which he {{incorporated}} with a crank-connecting rod mechanism in his twin-cylinder pump. Like the modern crankshaft, Al-Jazari's mechanism {{consisted of a}} wheel setting several <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> into motion, with the wheel's motion being circular and the pins moving back-and-forth in a straight line. The crankshaft described by al-Jazari transforms continuous rotary motion into a linear reciprocating motion.|$|R
5000|$|The engines were reboilered by the LMS in 1944, {{just before}} {{delivery}} to the NCC in August. The conversion to [...] gauge was simply done by reversing the wheels and renewing the tyres and <b>crank</b> <b>pins.</b> Their frames were not altered at all and, possibly {{due to the}} light nature of their work, the engines {{do not seem to}} have suffered from widening the gauge.|$|R

50|$|The 2-10-4 Texas {{type wheel}} {{arrangement}} {{had not been}} tried before on the SAR. To distribute the axle loads to within the maximum allowed for branch lines, the ten-coupled arrangement with a four-wheeled trailing bogie was required.
