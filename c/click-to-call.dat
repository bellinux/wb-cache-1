50|$|Google <b>Click-to-Call</b> was {{a service}} {{provided}} by Google which allowed users to call advertisers straight from Google search results pages.

For some time, similar <b>click-to-call</b> functionality was available for results in Google Maps. In the Froyo release of Google's Android operating system, certain advertisements included a very similar functionality. In iOS, phone numbers are automatically recognized as such. Web developers can also provide direct links to the Phone application, providing similar functionality.|$|E

As of January 2008, Google is testing <b>click-to-call</b> for businesses listed in search result pages 2. Some people {{have indicated that}} such failure {{is due to the}} fact that Google is using the CTC in the Auto Dialer mode, providing very little benefits to the end users. Other vendors who provide Callback mode fare differently such as Ingenio was acquired by AT&T Yellow Pages and eStara was acquired by ATG.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Click-to-call</b> (CTC) is {{actually}} a misleading name for this technology in its most common 21st century implementation. [...] "Click-to-call" [...] technology now virtually always refers to a means for a web consumer to ask a website operator to call her. In other words, [...] "click-to-call" [...] would be more accurately referred to as [...] "Request-a-Call," [...] as in [...] "Please {{give me a call}} (here is my phone number)." [...] CTC technology in most instances requires the web consumer to enter his phone number in order for the site operator, or its CSR s, or audio telephony version of an autoresponder, to place the call. CTC technology is now used most often to convert web-based traffic into direct telephone communication between an end user and some other entity. CTC originates out of the older PC2PC telephony whereby a client, or software application, was downloaded onto an end user's own personal computer to interface with the same software running on the other party's computer, to enable a conversation between the two computer users.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Nowadays, many {{projects}} {{are carried out}} in a collaboration of people or groups from different institutions and/or enterprises. Such a virtual organization is characterized by high communication needs but does not operate in one single environment. MetaVoIP eases the communication as it automatically combines contact information from different PBXs and provides it to all partners. For a given virtual organization the MetaVoIP server is periodically retrieving contact information from the participating organizations via different data source drivers. The PBX connectors provide the telephony functionality independent of an organization’s PBX, and the user GUI allows for easy user management as well as <b>click-to-call.</b> MetaVoIP has been implemented and tested; drivers exist for the Asterisk PBX and data input from LDAP and Asterisk configuration files. ...|$|E
40|$|As {{anyone with}} a {{smartphone}} can appreciate, the power of having a mobile phone that can can access the Internet creates significant value for users and opportunities for businesses. This device-level integration of communication services and web applications is now common. However, we are only now scratching {{the surface of the}} next step in value: application-level integration. The ability to integrate communications services within web applications opens up tremendous opportunities. Examples of communications enabled applications include simple <b>click-to-call</b> links on a website, conference calls initiated by applications or users in response to events, interactive voice response menus, and any number of other ways that communication services, such as messaging, voice, and conference calls, can be integrated into an application to add value. I recently had the pleasure of coordinating the activities of a group of entrepreneurs, developers, and architects as they explored together how CEAs can add value to their offerings and their business ecosystem. The Elena Project was funded by IRAP to stimulate small technology companies to develop working prototypes of CEAs and expand the capabilities of the Coral CEA business ecosystem and sandbox. The project focused on using four voice services and the open source web conferencing tool BigBlueButton. Among the outcomes of this project was the realization that significant value can be leveraged when communications features become integral parts of applications. In this issue of the OSBR, a diverse group of authors share their experiences and knowledge to help others explore the value CEAs could bring to their own offerings. All of the authors in this issue participated directly in the Elena project or present analysis relating to Coral CEA...|$|E
