The session highlighted the utility of stable isotope labelling in generating reference standards for metabolite identification, absolute quantification, and in the measurement of the dynamic activity of metabolic pathways. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} different approaches of fluxomics analyses including flux balance analysis, metabolic flux analysis and kinetic flux profiling were also discussed along with the use of stable isotope labelling in in vivo dynamic metabolomics. A number of crucial technical considerations for designing experiments and analyzing data with stable isotope labelling were discussed which included replication, instrumentation, methods of labelling, tracer dilution and data analysis. This report reflects the current viewpoint on the use of stable isotope labelling in metabolomics experiments, identifying it as a great tool with the potential to improve biological interpretation of metabolomics data in a number of ways...|$|E

Large and comprehensive networks, like Metabolic-Expression networks that explicitly accounts for the demands of macromolecular synthesis at single nucleotide resolution, are inherently multiscale because reaction rates can vary over many orders of magnitude. Naively using standard optimization systems to <b>conduct</b> <b>flux</b> balance analysis can produce inaccurate or infeasible results. Results We describe lifting techniques that enable off-the-shelf optimization software to compute accurate solutions to the poorly scaled optimization problems arising from flux balance analysis of multiscale biochemical reaction networks.

ECRH is used to probe transport features, both in steady state {{and in response to}} time-varying heating, while LHCD is used for current density profile shaping. The experiments clearly show resiliency in the electron temperature profile response to localized ECRH. Central, low gradient plasmas are characterized by low stiffness, {{in the sense that the}} temperature gradient can change with <b>conducted</b> heat <b>flux,</b> and low electron thermal diffusivity. Strong stiffness, in the sense that the temperature gradient length 1 /LT=-T/T does not change significantly even with largely different heating profiles and intensity, and high diffusivity are found in the confinement region (0. 15 <r/a< 0. 5). A particular attention is given to the experimental investigation of the transition layer between low-high diffusivity (and low-high stiffness) regions, which is found at the EC deposition radius rdep in case of powerful ECRH. A transition layer, well identified by heat waves launched by modulated ECH, is found also in plasmas with dominant ohmic heating, showing that it is a local plasma feature, and not merely a consequence of a step-wise increase in the <b>conducted</b> heat <b>flux</b> at rdep. A novel experimental technique providing localized modulation of the temperature gradient shows strong dependence of heat diffusivity on LT at the transition layer.

We have thoroughly investigated the availabilities of different techniques in modeling the CH₄ near-IR bands (3. 3, 2. 3, and 1. 7 μm) and calculating the heating rates of these bands for pressures between 10 ⁻³ μbar and 100 mbar and temperatures between 50 K to 300 K.

The third is based on neutron counts measured by the neutron spectrometer (NS) on Odyssey. The TES data are based on an energy balance. The net radiative loss (gain) in a column is balanced by latent heating due condensation (sublimation) of CO 2. In calculating the mass budget, the other main energy sources, atmospheric heat transport and subsurface conduction, were neglected. At the pole, atmospheric heat transport is indeed a small term. However, subsurface heat conduction can be significant because at the North Pole water ice, which has a high thermal conductivity compared to bare soil, is a dominant component of the subsurface. Thus, heat conducted down into the ice during summer will slowly bleed back out during fall and winter reducing the amount of CO 2 that condenses on the pole.
