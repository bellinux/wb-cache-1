40|$|M. A. According to Correctional Services Act 111 of 1998, DCS has {{moral and}} legal {{responsibility}} over the parolees. Parolees {{are supposed to}} be reintegrated into the society, while still serving their sentences and ultimately become responsible citizens. Some of the parolees are unable to <b>complete</b> <b>their</b> parole sentences and end up re-offending. There are however some parolees who manage to <b>complete</b> <b>their</b> sentences successfully, despite the parole conditions and their personal circumstances. The researcher was interested in those parolees who <b>completed</b> <b>their</b> parole sentences successfully. The strengths perspective, together with other strength related theories, served as a theoretical lens that helped to identify and describe factors that enable parolees to <b>complete</b> <b>their</b> sentences successfully. A qualitative design and descriptive approach was employed. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect the data. A sample of 15 parolees who had <b>completed</b> <b>their</b> sentences successfully was identified. Data were analysed using Creswell’s approach. It was found that factors such as employment, educational qualification, job skills, personal qualities, support, relationships and networking enabled parolees to <b>complete</b> <b>their</b> sentences successfully.

5|$|Tomato plants over-expressing systemin {{produced}} more {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) than normal plants and parasitoid wasps found them more attractive. Systemin also upregulates the expression of genes involved {{in the production of}} biologically active VOCs. Such a response is crucial if antinutritional defences are to be effective, since without predators, developing insects would consume more plant material while <b>completing</b> <b>their</b> development. It is likely that VOC production is upregulated through different pathways, including oxylipin pathway that synthesises jasmonic acid aldehydes and alcohols that function in wound healing.|$|E

5|$|After 1347, John VI Kantakouzenos {{tried to}} revive the Empire, but met with limited success.

An attempt to break Byzantium's dependence for food and maritime commerce on the Genoese merchants of Galata led to a Byzantine–Genoese war, which ended in 1352 with a compromise peace. In 1350, Kantakouzenos took advantage of Dušan's preoccupation with a war against Bosnia to recover Thessalonica from the Zealots as well as Berroia, Vodena and other Macedonian cities from the Serbs, but the Serbian emperor quickly reversed the Byzantine gains, leaving only Thessalonica in Byzantine hands.|$|E
