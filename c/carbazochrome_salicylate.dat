For the patients with obvious joint swelling and pain, joint puncture and aspiration technique {{should be performed}} under the conditions of factor VIII supplement and strict local disinfection to reduce stress, relieve pain and reduce the damage of hematocele to articular cartilage and bone. To prevent local infection, chronic fistula formation and fatal septicemia, aspiration, drainage and biopsy should not be performed during treatment. For the late phase joint disease, synovectomy, joint irrigation, arthrodesis or arthroplasty should be performed depending on {{the severity of the}} lesions (Auerswald et al. 2012). Replacement therapy is still preferred in systemic treatment. The factor replacement therapy can be divided into preventive treatment and the treatment based on specific needs of the patients. In 1994, WFH (International Federation of Hemophilia) and WHO established the early preventive treatment as the best treatment protocol for pediatric patients with severe hemophilia. Specifically speaking, the systemic therapy includes the following aspects: (1) Replacement therapy: fresh frozen plasma; cryoprecipitate; genetic engineering products of F VIII; F VIII preparations from animal; recombinant activated factor VIIÎ± preparations; prothrombin complex concentrate; FIX preparations with high purity. (2) Medication-assisted therapy: ranitidine, desmopressin, danazol, antifibrinolytic agents and <b>carbazochrome</b> <b>salicylate.</b> (3) Spleen cell transplantation or spleen transplantation. (4) Gene therapy. Since 1970 s, the morbidity and mortality of hemophilia has been greatly reduced with the effective application of replacement treatment. Since 1980 s, the safety of replacement treatment is guaranteed with the continuous improvement of virus inactivation technology, thereby greatly reducing the incidence of viral hepatitis and AIDS in hemophilia. Since the 1990 s, the widespread application of recombinant coagulation factors not only improves the efficacy, but also avoids the side effects of antibody production and viral infection caused by the application of traditional human-derived clotting factors. Gene therapy achieves success in animal trials. The results of gene therapy in preliminary clinical trials also bring hope to hemophilia patients (High 2014).|$|E
