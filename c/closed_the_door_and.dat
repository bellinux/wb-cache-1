Seeing smoke seeping into her room, she opened the bedroom door and called to her brother, then <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> placed the hang-up 9-1-1 call that alerted police. She then crawled out of her bedroom window to escape the fire.|$|E
25|$|At the start, crowd {{favorite}} Juan Pablo Montoya {{pulled his}} Williams from third spot {{around the outside}} of Michael Schumacher's Ferrari into Turn 1. Side by side through the initial right-hander, the two avoided contact by inches as Schumacher <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> seized the advantage into the left-handed Turn 2. It soon became clear, however, that the fastest car on the track was the Ferrari of Rubens Barrichello, ostensibly carrying a light fuel load and on a two-stop strategy. The Brazilian took second from Montoya beginning Lap 3, then passed Schumacher two laps later for the lead.|$|E
