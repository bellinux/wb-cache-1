A subduction zone is a type of contact between different crustal plates where heavier crust slides below lighter crust.

40|$|Bone {{remodeling}} is {{an important}} factor in orthodontic tooth movement. During orthodontic treatment, osteoclasts are subjected to various mechanical stimuli, and this promotes or inhibits osteoclast differentiation and fusion. It has been previously reported that the release from tensile force induces osteoclast differentiation. However, little is known about how release from <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> affects osteoclasts. The present study investigated the effects of release from <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> on osteoclasts. The number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) -positive multinucleated osteoclasts derived from RAW 264. 7 cells was counted, and gene expression associated with osteoclast differentiation and fusion in response to release from <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Osteoclast number was increased by optimal <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> application. On release from this force, osteoclast differentiation and fusion were suppressed. mRNA expression of NFATc 1 was inhibited for 6 h subsequent to release from <b>compressive</b> <b>force.</b> mRNA expression of the other osteoclast-specific genes, TRAP, RANK, matrix metalloproteinase- 9, cathepsin-K, chloride channel 7, ATPase H+ transporting vacuolar proton pump member I, dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein and osteoclast stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC-STAMP) was significantly inhibited at 3 h following release from <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> compared with control cells. These findings suggest that release from optimal <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> suppresses osteoclast differentiation and fusion, which may be important for developing orthodontic treatments...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the electrical and thermal contact resistance in metal foam-graphite assemblies considered {{for use in}} next generation air-cooled fuel cells as replacements of currently available water-cooled ones. Their successful application requires minimization of thermal and electrical contact resistance between components. The current study investigates the evolution of both resistances with increasing <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> between metallic foam and graphite plates. Reducing these contact resistances through <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> instead of brazing significantly reduces the manufacturing cost. Our results show that both electrical and thermal resistances monotonically decrease with increasing <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> when moving from no <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> to a slight one about 100 N (corresponding to a compressive stress of 0. 01 MPa). Interestingly, compared with the thermal contact resistance, the electrical contact resistance shows more sensitivity to <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> within this range of force. Furthermore, it has been noted that increases in <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> beyond 300 N (i. e. 0. 03 MPa) decrease the resistances only marginally. Electrical contact resistance was found to govern the total resistance of the metal foam-graphite assembly since electric bulk resistances are several orders of magnitude lower. Similar observations are made for thermal resistance where the minimum contact resistance exceeds the thermal resistance of the foam in our experiments...|$|R

The topography, and geologic history, of the Bay Area can largely be attributed to the <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> between the Pacific Plate and the North American plate. The three major ridge structures in the Bay Area, part of the Pacific Coast Range, are all roughly parallel to the major faults. The Santa Cruz Mountains along the San Francisco Peninsula and the Marin Hills in Marin County follow the San Andreas fault, The Berkeley Hills, San Leandro Hills and their southern ridgeline extension through Mission Peak roughly follow the Hayward fault, and the Diablo Range, which includes Mount Diablo and Mount Hamilton and runs along the Calaveras fault.|$|E

The maximum permissible <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> of the motor, the influences of the contact layer material, the thickness of the contact layer, and the <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> on motor performance have been discussed.

40|$|The role of {{the neural}} arch in weight {{transmission}} in the cervical and upper thoracic regions of the vertebral column has been investigated. Measurements at the levels of C 2, C 4, C 6, C 7, T 1 and T 5 vertebrae were made in 44 adult male vertebral columns. At each level, {{the area of the}} inferior surface of the body was compared with the area of the inferior articular facets, the pedicle index and the arch index; inclination of the pedicle in relation to the body was also measured. On the basis of these studies it was found that at C 2 level the <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> acting on the superior articular surfaces was transmitted to the inferior surface of the body and to the two inferior articular facets. From C 2 to C 7, <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> is transmitted through three parallel columns - one anterior, formed by the bodies and intervertebral discs, and two posterior, formed by the articulations of the articular processes on either side. Due to the posterior curvature in the cervical region, the posterior columns here sustain more of the <b>compressive</b> <b>force.</b> From C 7 level downwards, the <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> is transmitted through two columns, i. e. one anterior formed by the bodies and intervertebral discs and one posterior formed by successive articulations of the laminae. Below C 7 level, <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> from the posterior column is partly transferred to the anterior column through the pedicles at T 1 and T 2.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the response of human periodontal ligament (hPDL) fibroblasts to an intermittent <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> and its effect on the expression of SOST, POSTN, and TGFB 1. A computerized cell <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> loading apparatus was introduced, and hPDL cells were subjected to intermittent <b>compressive</b> <b>force.</b> The changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression were monitored by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively. An increased expression of SOST, POSTN, and TGFB 1 was observed in a time-dependent fashion. Addition of cycloheximide, a transforming growth factor (TGF) -Î² inhibitor (SB 431542), or a neutralizing antibody against TGF-Î² 1 attenuated the force-induced expression of SOST and POSTN as well as sclerostin and periostin, indicating a role of TGF-Î² 1 in the pressure-induced expression of these proteins. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis revealed an increased level of TGF-Î² 1 in the cell extracts but not in the medium, suggesting that intermittent <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> promoted the accumulation of TGF-Î² 1 in the cells or their surrounding matrix. In conclusion, an intermittent <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> regulates SOST/POSTN expression by hPDL cells via the TGF-Î² 1 signaling pathway.

25|$|The {{development}} of the vascular network is self-organized at each point in the tissue due to the balance between <b>compressive</b> <b>forces</b> of tissue expansion and circumferential stretch of the vessel walls. Over time, this means that migrating lines become straight rather than curving; this is akin to imagining two moving boundaries pushing on each other.

25|$|The spinal discs are {{composed}} of a tough spongiform ring of cartilage ("anulus fibrosus") with a more malleable center ("nucleus pulposus"). The discs separate the vertebrae, thereby allowing room for the nerve roots to properly exit through the spaces between the vertebrae. The discs cushion the spine from <b>compressive</b> <b>forces,</b> but are weak to pressure applied during rotational movements. That is why a person who bends to one side, at a bad angle to pick something up, may more likely herniate a spinal disc than a person jumping from a ladder and landing on their feet.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} of a strut-braced wing (SBW) aircraft show that, at high positive load factors, a large tensile {{force in the}} strut leads to a considerable <b>compressive</b> axial <b>force</b> in the inner wing, resulting in a reduced bending stiffness and even buckling of the wing. Studying the influence of this <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> on the structural response of SBW is thus of paramount importance in the early stage of SBW design.

40|$|It is {{generally}} advised that the graft inserted in adult cervical spine should be pre-loaded with a <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> {{or that the}} screws are inserted in a divergent orientation, in order to maximise compression and the chance of graft incorporation (Truumees et al. in Spine 28 : 1097 â 1102, 2003). However, {{there is little evidence}} that a <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> is maintained once the force applicator has been removed, or that the divergent screws enhance compression. This study compared the maintenance of applied pre-load force, across cervical spine graft, between standard anterior plating technique with pre-load and divergent screws and a novel plate technique, which allows its application prior to removal of the force applicator. Six intact adult cadaveric human cervical spines were exposed by standard surgical technique. A Casper type distracter was inserted across the disc space of interest, the disc was removed. In 14 experiments, following the disc removal, an autologous iliac crest bone graft was inserted under distraction, together with a strain gauge pressure transducer. A resting output from the transducer was recorded. The voltage output has a linear relationship with <b>compressive</b> <b>force.</b> A standardised <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> was applied across the graft through the âCasper typeâ distracter/compressor (7. 5 Â kg, torque). The pre-load <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> was measured using a torque drill. Then two different procedures were used in order to compare the final applied strain on the bone graft. In eight experiments (procedure 1), the âCasper typeâ distracter/compressor was removed and a standard anterior cervical plate with four divergent screws was inserted. In six experiments (procedure 2), a novel plate design was inserted prior to removal of the distracter/compressor, which is not possible with the standard plate design. A final <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> across the graft was measured. For the standard plate construct (procedure 1), the applied compression force is significantly greater than resting (SO/SC) âP= 0. 01, but the compression force is not maintained once the compressor is removed (SO/SR) âP= 0. 27. Final bone graft compression after plate insertion is not significantly different to the resting state (SO/SF) âP= 0. 16 (Wilcoxonâs sign test for paired observation). Application of the plate tended to offload the graft; the final <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> is 170 Â± 100 % less than the resting force. None of the applied force was maintained (mean 9. 5 Â± 8. 8 %). For the new plate (procedure 2), the end <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> (SF) measured across the graft was greater than the resting force (SO) (P< 0. 001). Further, the novel plate application increased the <b>compressive</b> <b>force</b> on the graft by 712 Â± 484 %. The final bone graft compression using a novel plate, which allows its application prior to removal of the force applicator, is significant (SO/SF) âP= 0. 01. Here, 77 Â± 10 % of the applied pre-load was maintained. The difference between the plates is significant (P< 0. 001). Conclusions are as follows: (1) Applied pre-load is not maintained across a graft once the force applicator is removed. (2) Divergent screws with a plate do not compress graft and rather tend to offload it. (3) <b>Compressive</b> <b>force</b> may be maintained if the plate is applied prior to the force applicator removal...|$|R

They are found in salamanders, and in some non-avian dinosaurs. Heterocoelous vertebrae have saddle-shaped articular surfaces. This type of configuration is seen in turtles that retract their necks, and birds, because it permits extensive lateral and vertical flexion motion without stretching the nerve cord too extensively or wringing it about its long axis.|$|E

25|$|The {{energy of}} the nuclear {{explosion}} is released in one microsecond. In the following few microseconds, the test hardware and surrounding rock are vaporised, with temperatures of several million degrees and pressures of several million atmospheres. Within milliseconds, a bubble of high-pressure gas and steam is formed. The heat and expanding shock wave cause the surrounding rock to vaporise, or be melted further away, creating a melt cavity. The shock-induced motion and high internal pressure cause this cavity to expand outwards, which continues over several tenths of a second until the pressure has fallen sufficiently, to a level roughly comparable {{with the weight of}} the rock above, and can no longer grow. Although not observed in every explosion, four distinct zones (including the melt cavity) have been described in the surrounding rock. The crushed zone, about two times the radius of the cavity, consists of rock that has lost all of its former integrity. The cracked zone, about three times the cavity radius, consists of rock with radial and concentric fissures. Finally, the zone of irreversible strain consists of rock deformed by the pressure. The following layer undergoes only an elastic deformation; the strain and subsequent release then forms a seismic wave. A few seconds later the molten rock starts collecting {{on the bottom of the}} cavity and the cavity content begins cooling.
