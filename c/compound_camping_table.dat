40|$|A {{study was}} made of the interrelationship of serotonin, cAMP, and calcium ions in the {{regulation}} of regeneration of cilia by Tetrahymena pyriformis. All these compounds stimulated the regeneration, whereas a blocker of serotonin synthesis, p-chlorophenylalanine, and a calcium chelator, EGTA, inhibited the process. This inhibition could be overcome by the addition of any of the stimulatory <b>compounds.</b> <b>cAMP</b> was also found to be inhibitory at high concentrations. The intracellular concentration of this nucleotide was found to increase during the regeneration, and this increase occurred precociously in the presence of serotonin. It was concluded that serotonin may regulate ciliary regeneration by a mechanism involving cAMP And calcium ions, but that the causal relationships among these compounds still need to be established...|$|R

He knew how to be amiable; and the young men of the engineering staff, for whom the surveying of the railway track had the glamour of the first steps on the path of life, sat there, too, listening modestly, with their smooth faces tanned by the weather, and very pleased to witness so much affability in so great a man.|$|R

Medico-evangelistic work was undertaken amongst the Himalayan slopes and the missionary parties would endure extreme conditions to spread the Christian gospels. Dr Hutchison worked tirelessly amongst lepers and was awarded the Kaisar-i-Hind medal when he retired. He also aided Sir Aurel Stein (1862 - 1943) in his research in the Punjab and Kashmir.

As committee member Captain Francis Cadell had opposed his appointment as leader of the expedition, Burke refused his offer to transport the supplies to Adelaide by ship and then up the Murray and Darling Rivers to be collected on the way; everything was instead loaded onto six wagons. One wagon broke down before it had even left Royal Park and by midnight of the first day the expedition had reached only Essendon on the edge of Melbourne. At Essendon two more wagons broke down. Heavy rains and bad roads made travelling through Victoria difficult and time-consuming. The party arrived at Lancefield on 23 August and set up their fourth camp. The first day off was taken on Sunday, 26 August at Camp VI in Mia Mia.|$|R
50|$|Selby {{is located}} {{more to the}} north and more distant from Soda Lake Road. A good gravel road leads to the {{campground}} from Soda Lake Road over a distance of five miles. The road is generally usable in all weather conditions, but does wind and have some moderate grades as it approaches the campground area. This site is much more rugged, located on a man-made cut into the natural terrain, bounded by hills and canyons. <b>Camp</b> <b>tables</b> are covered by shade structures, a permanent and toilet outhouse is available (no water), camping is allowed anywhere upon the large flat areas. Hiking up and into the adjoining Wilderness Study Area provides hearty exercise and impressive views. The nearby Selby Rocks formation offers a view of large granite boulders. (It is not advised to climb the rocks as the loose granite surface is fragile.) A recent addition is a water spigot that provides non-potable water to the campsites.|$|R
