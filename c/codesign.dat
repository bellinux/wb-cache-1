2500|$|University of Washington {{station was}} {{designed}} by LMN Architects, a Seattle-based firm that also worked on 13 other light rail stations on the future East Link and Lynnwood Link projects. LMN received several design awards for their work on the station, including a International Architecture Award from the Chicago Athenaeum, an Award of Merit from the Seattle chapter of the American Institute of Architects, and an Honorable Mention in the Fast <b>Co.Design</b> Innovation By Design Awards. One major component of the station's architecture is the [...] "chamber"-like mezzanine, which contains the station's sole piece of public art: Subterraneum by Leo Saul Berk. Subterraneum, funded by Sound Transit's system-wide public art program, consists of 6,000 backlit LED panels lining {{the walls of the}} chamber. Berk took inspiration from the geologic maps for the project and symbols representing the strata of layers near the station, while also adding some original creations. The installation was praised for its scale and evocative staging by Gary Faigin of The Seattle Times, and called an [...] "underground planetarium" [...] by the Huffington Post. The station's pictogram consists of a graduation cap with the University of Washington logo.|$|E

40|$|Co-design is {{commonly}} discussed as a generic method to develop empathetic connections and understandings {{of people and}} their contexts. In this use, mastering the craft of co-design had inadvertently isolated the method from the practitioner, fragmenting its process {{as a series of}} static events or staged workshops. To counteract this occurrence, our paper &# 039;re-entangles&# 039; <b>codesigning</b> back into its lived and enacted contexts. We see co-designing as an embodied process of discovery and actualization, and it is an integral, on-going activity of designing services. <b>Codesigning</b> catalyses a transformative process in revealing and unlocking tacit knowledge, moving people along on a journey to &# 039;make real&# 039; what proposed services might be like in the future. <b>Codesigning</b> plays a critical role especially when it involves the very people who are enmeshed in the realization of the proposed services itself. As such, our case study of a weekend Ordnance Survey Geovation camp, pays closer attention to how this took place and discusses the transformative process that was central to it. By taking a phenomenological perspective and building on a seminal anthropologists&# 039; work, Tim Ingold, our paper counters the limitations in service design that tends to see its process as a contained series of fixed interactions or systemized process of methods. Instead, we open it up to designing that is being and becoming, that is constantly transforming and connecting multiple entanglements...|$|R

50|$|ASIPs {{can be used}} as an {{alternative}} of hardware accelerators for baseband signal processing or video coding. Traditional hardware accelerators for these applications suffer from inflexibility. It is very difficult to reuse the hardware datapath with handwritten finite-state machines (FSM). The retargetable compilers of ASIPs help the designer to update the program and reuse the datapath. Typically, the ASIP design is more or less dependent on the tool flow because designing a processor from scratch can be very complicated. There are some commercial tools to design ASIPs, for example Processor Designer from Synopsys. There is an open source tool as well, TTA-based <b>codesign</b> environment (TCE).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Most hardware/software <b>codesigns</b> of Elliptic Curve Cryp-tography {{only have}} one central control unit, {{typically}} a 32 bit or 8 bit processor core. With the ability of integrating several soft processor cores into one FPGA fabric, {{we can have a}} hierarchy of controllers in one SoC design. Compared to the previous <b>codesigns</b> trying to optimize the com-munication overhead between the central control unit and coprocessor over bus by using different bus protocols (e. g. OPB, PLB and FSL) or advanced techniques (e. g. DMA), our approach prevents overhead in bus transactions by introducing a local 8 bit microcontroller, PicoBlaze, in the coprocessor. As a result, the performance of the ECC coprocessor can be almost independent of the selection of bus protocols. To further accelerate the Uni-PicoBlaze based ECC SoC design, a Dual-PicoBlaze based architecture is proposed, which can achieve the maximum instruc-tion rate of 1 instruction/cycle to the ECC datapath. Using design space exploration {{of a large number of}} system configurations of different ar-chitectures discussed in this paper, our proposed Dual-PicoBlaze based design also shows best trade-off between area and speed. ...|$|R
