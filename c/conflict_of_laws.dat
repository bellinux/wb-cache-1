5|$|Apple's {{litigation}} over {{object code}} {{contributed to the}} development of contemporary copyright law because the company's object code cases brought different results in different courts, creating a <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> that resulted in international litigation. In the 1980s, Apple litigated two copyright cases with central issues that included the question of whether object code (as contrasted with source code) of a computer program is subject to copyright laws. A third case in which Apple was not a party but that involved the Apple decisions followed in New Zealand. The specific cases were Computer Edge Pty. Ltd. v Apple Computer Inc. (1986, Australia) ("Computer Edge"), Apple Computer Inc. v Mackintosh Computers Ltd., (Canada, 1987) ("Apple v. Mackintosh"), and IBM v. Computer Imports Ltd. ("IBM v. Computer Imports"), (New Zealand, 1989).|$|E
5|$|In these <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> cases, Apple {{met with}} {{conflicting}} international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court {{decision on the}} copyrightability of object code. In IBM v. Computer Imports, the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of copyright takes place if it is copied without the authorization of the copyright owner. Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until {{the creation of an}} international legal regime embodied in further changes to national copyright laws, which ultimately made object code subject to copyright law. These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to copyright law are still controversial. The revisions also form the technical underpinnings (via the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act) for the legal notions of electronic privacy violation and computer trespass, as well as the further development of anti-hacking law-making such as the Patriot Act and the Convention on Cybercrime.|$|E
40|$|China has a {{long history}} <b>of</b> {{addressing}} <b>conflict</b> issues between different legal systems. However, there is as yet no unified legislation on <b>Conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Law</b> in China. Rules on the topic <b>of</b> <b>Conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Law</b> can be found in various legal sources without a clear structure or statement of their hierarchy and effectiveness. This research draws a comprehensive, well-organized map <b>of</b> <b>Conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Law</b> rules in China by introducing the evolution <b>of</b> <b>Conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Law</b> in China, defining the scope <b>of</b> <b>Conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Law</b> as a legal science, restating the structure and contents <b>of</b> Chinese <b>Conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Law</b> rules, and examining the theory and legislative technique on these rules.
