Unexpectedly, he found himself {{defending}} an ad in which he appeared supporting the National Rifle Association (NRA) and his position on gun ownership. After questions from O'Donnell, Selleck said, [...] "It's your show, and you <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> after I leave." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{lyrics that}} Beck pointed out were: [...] "Cleaned up {{corporation}} progress, {{dying in the}} process / Children that <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> living on the railways [...] / People moving sideways / Sell it till your last days / Buy yourself the motivation / Generation nothing / Nothing but a dead scene / Product of a white dream". Gerard Way responded to the accusation on the band's official website, writing, [...] "I think the word Glenn Beck was looking for was 'subversion' not 'propaganda', because I don't know {{what it would be}} considered propaganda for—truth? Sentiment?" [...] He also said that he was [...] "shocked that no actual fact-checking was done on the lyrics".|$|E

I <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> now at 65 because it's sort of, dispassionate about it, and I've seen worse things since, but that gave me a bit of a turn, yes, I didn't enjoy that.

2500|$|Nikita [...] "Nikki" [...] Singh {{is played}} by Anannya Kolvankar, and is the title {{character}} and the second-youngest Singh child. She is generally portrayed as being happy. It sometimes takes a few tries {{to get her to}} do the right thing. Many of the Singh family's adventures revolve around Nikki. Both her older brothers, Rohan and Sunny, are often seen using Nikki for their own benefit, although Rohan shows that he cares about her deeply. Sunny seems to dislike Nikki the most although, in some episodes, he is seen being quite fond of her. Himani thinks of Nikki as the perfect baby. It was revealed in [...] "Nikki is 1!" [...] that it was Dolly's idea to nickname her Nikki. Nikki speaks more often in later episodes of seasons two and three. Bobby was born on her birthday; she responded to this by [...] "I like this present." [...] In season three, her personality begins to develop, as she is seen as sneaky and mischievous, such as pretending to like a doll Himani bought for her to like Bobby, then throwing it away when she was not looking, and also telling Himani's [...] "friends" [...] what she really thinks of them, causing her to lose them all. Also, she is shown as not liking Bobby as in the episode [...] "The Extravagant Couch", when she asks Avatar if Bobby is going to stay at the hotel and he says no and Nikki asks if they <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> In Good Luck Charlie, Nikki is the equivalent of Charlie Duncan who {{is played by}} Mia Talerico.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{revealed}} in 2004 that {{an error in}} the control program made the spaceship ascend from orbit instead of descending. Tereshkova noticed the fault {{on the first day}} of the flight and reported it to spaceship designer Sergey Korolev. The team on Earth provided Tereshkova with new data to enter into the descent program which corrected the problem. By request of Korolev, Tereshkova kept the problem secret for dozens of years.

5000|$|A piece such as tlakwa {{speaks to}} a more {{ambiguous}} kind of oppression, whereby matrices of race, power and servility are made visible in something as seemingly innocuous as a commemorative coin. Robert Enright, curator of a survey show of Drever's work entitled, Everything {{is going to be}} OK again soon, says of Drever: [...] "Dean’s main interests are issues of power, violence and racism. Those are pretty heavy topics, but we believe art is serious business and if you can’t <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> some of our greatest challenges and the things that influence most directly as a society with art, how <b>can</b> you <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> Art is free to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> everything." ...|$|R

60|$|His {{article is}} as sound as a nut.

And so he has a right to be a critic.|$|E

40|$|Quantum {{physicists}} {{have reached}} a point commonly only attained by mystics: they understand something with amazing clarity yet <b>can</b> only <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in parables and metaphors. In this context, qigong with its Daoist background is a powerful way to integrate these apparently opposing ways of apperception and understanding. It allows us to realise cosmic oneness {{in the activities of}} daily life. This book succeeds in presenting both an easily accessible outline of quantum physics and also an appreciation of mysticism beyond vagueness and obscurity. From here it describes the physical and mental movements of qigong as a way of integrating body and mind, head and heart, detailing specific exercises and outlining their rationale and effects...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of February 8, 1887, an {{argument}} broke out between Jim Courtright and Luke Short, when Courtright tried to force his protection racket on Short's White Elephant saloon. Luke rejected his offer, which infuriated Courtright and made him storm off. Courtright, carrying two pistols in his belt, came back and called out to Luke Short, but a friend named Jake Johnson managed to calm Courtright down so they <b>can</b> all <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> instead.Both <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> their dispute as they walked, before stopping and facing each other three to four feet apart at Ella Blackwell’s Shooting Gallery. In the celebrated gunfight that followed, Short was the last man standing. Here, in his own words, is Short's description of what happened: ...|$|R

60|$|Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This {{scarecrow}} of a suit has, in {{course of}} time, become so complicated that no man alive {{knows what it}} means. The parties to it understand it least, {{but it has been}} observed that no two Chancery lawyers <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for five minutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the premises. Innumerable children have been born into the cause; innumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people have died out of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found themselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how or why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the suit. The little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new rocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown up, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away into the other world. Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and grandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone out; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere bills of mortality; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth perhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a coffee-house in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags its dreary length before the court, perennially hopeless.|$|E
6000|$|Then without {{mentioning}} names {{he told the}} story of Lord Rufford, Goarly, and Scrobby, {{in such a way as}} partly to redeem himself with his audience. He acknowledged how absolutely he had been himself befooled, and how he had been done out of his money by misplaced sympathy. He made Mrs. Goarly's goose immortal, and in imitating the indignation of Runce the farmer and Bean the gamekeeper showed that he was master of considerable humour. But he brought it all round at last to his own purpose, and ended this episode of his lecture by his view of the absurdity and illegality of British hunting. [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to you," [...] he said, [...] "and you will know whether I am speaking the truth. But when I get home among my own people, and repeat my lecture there, as I shall do,--with some little additions as to the good things I have found here from which your ears may be spared,--I shall omit this story as I know it will be impossible to make my countrymen believe that a hundred harum-scarum tomboys may ride at their pleasure over every man's land, destroying crops and trampling down fences, going, if their vermin leads them there, with reckless violence into the sweet domestic garden of your country residences; and that no one can either stop them or punish them!

They have been lawyers to our family for I don't know how many years, and are no doubt {{excellent}} men in their capacity of family lawyers, but this matter is altogether out of their line. They looked at each other like two helpless fools when I told them the story, and said at once that they would not undertake to advise me, but that I had better go to Levine, or one of the other men who are always engaged in these what they call delicate cases, that is to say, hideous scandals. However, I have made up my mind to keep clear of them all as far as I can; but, of course, I must be guided to some extent by Halliburn's opinion, or rather his wishes. As to his opinion, I have no confidence in it one way or the other. I'm glad you did not say anything about what you had been doing before my cousin; she is worrying herself almost into a fever about it, the more so because there is no one to whom she <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> She means well, but were it not that just at present it is absolutely necessary that Dorothy should show herself everywhere with a perfectly unconcerned air, I would make some excuse to send Mrs. Daintree down to the country again; as it is, I must keep her as a chaperon, but she is very trying I assure you, and I believe would come into my study to cry over the affair half-a-dozen times a day, if I would but let her. Now, Ned, you must excuse me, the carriage will be round in a few minutes, and as, with one thing and another, I got back too late to dress for dinner, I have not another minute to spare.

40|$|I will {{describe}} a few techniques that {{are widely used}} in computer vision these days and I consider them hot methods. There is no standard tool for measuring whether a method is hot or not, and this is solely based on my personal judgement as a researcher who is attending computer vision conferences and is actively publishing in this area.

40|$|You’re {{too young}} to be depressed” – a saying I’ve heard far too many times when {{disclosing}} my experiences at university to my peers. Depression (or any non-normative health issue), I have come to realise, is not something that <b>can</b> be <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> objectively. <b>It’s</b> an individual experience which has complete relevance to the person who has gone through it.

6000|$|... "Yes, lad, you {{may well}} be {{surprised}} at seeing a third wrangler a village schoolmaster, but you might find, if you searched, many men who took as high a degree, in even more humble positions. I took a fellowship, and lived for many years quietly upon it; then I married, and forfeited my fellowship. I thought, like many other men, that because I had taken a good degree I could earn my living. There is no greater mistake. I had absolutely no knowledge that was useful that way. I tried to write; I tried to get pupils: I failed all round. Thirteen years ago, {{after two years of}} marriage, my wife died; and in despair of otherwise earning my bread, and sick of the struggle I had gone through, I applied for this little mastership, obtained it, and came down with Alice, then a baby of a year old. I chafed at first, but I am contented now, and no one knows that Mr. Merton is an ex-fellow of St. John's. I had still a little property remaining, just enough to have kept Alice always at a good school. I do not think I shall stay here much longer. I shall try to get a larger school, in some town where I may find a few young men to teach of an evening. I am content for myself; but Alice is growing up, and I should wish, for her sake, to get a step up in the world again. I need not say, my lad, that I don't want this mentioned. Alice and you alone know my story. So you see," [...] he went on more lightly, [...] "I may say you have had a good teacher. Now, Jack, you are very high up in mathematics. Far higher than I was at your age; and I have not the slightest doubt that you will {{in a couple of years}} be able to take the best open scholarship of the year at Cambridge, if you try for it. That would keep you at college, and you might hope confidently to come out at least as high as I did, and to secure a fellowship, which means three or four hundred a year, till you marry. But to go through the university you must have a certain amount of Latin and Greek. You have a good two years, before you have to go up, and if you devote yourself as steadily to classics as you have to mathematics, you could get up enough to scrape through with. Don't give me any answer now, Jack. The idea is, of course, new to you.

60|$|There are a {{great many}} people who imagine that {{elementary}} teaching might be properly carried out by teachers provided with only elementary knowledge. Let me assure you that that is the profoundest mistake in the world. There is nothing so difficult to do as to write a good elementary book, and there is nobody so hard to teach properly and well as people who know nothing about a subject, and I will tell you why. If I address an audience of persons who are occupied in the same line of work as myself, I can assume that they know a vast deal, and that they can find out the blunders I make. If they don't, it is their fault and not mine; but when I appear before a body of people who know nothing about the matter, who take for gospel whatever I say, surely it becomes needful that I consider what I say, make sure that it will bear examination, and that I do not impose upon the credulity of those who have faith in me. In the second place, it involves that difficult process of knowing what you know so well that you <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> as you can talk about your ordinary business. A man can always talk about his own business. He can always make it plain; but, if his knowledge is hearsay, he is afraid to go beyond what he has recollected, and put it before those that are ignorant in such a shape that they shall comprehend it. That is why, to be a good elementary teacher, to teach the elements of any subject, requires most careful consideration, if you are a master of the subject; and, if you are not a master of it, it is needful you should familiarise yourself with so much as you are called upon to teach--soak yourself in it, so to speak--until you know it as part of your daily life and daily knowledge, and then {{you will be able to}} teach anybody. That is what I mean by practical teachers, and, although the deficiency of such teachers is being remedied to a large extent, I think it is one which has long existed, and which has existed from no fault of those who undertook to teach, but because, until the last score of years, it absolutely was not possible for any one in a great many branches of science, whatever his desire might be, to get instruction which would enable him to be a good teacher of elementary things. All that is being rapidly altered, and I hope it will soon become a thing of the past.|$|E

30|$|The vested {{interests}} have thus influenced or rather controlled the educational discourse, {{in a number}} of ways. First, by controlling who <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> what. <b>It</b> may often be inappropriate for non-subject specialists to discuss the content of a subject curriculum. Who would be eligible to discuss the mathematics or history curriculum within the professional environment of a school, aside from the subject specialists? The other specialists, e.g. the school leadership, might be eligible to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> assessment procedures or didactics and of interdisciplinary exploration, but not the intricate content of the subject curriculum. Second, the discussion about content is most of the time defined by the existing subjects. Defending an existing subject will be done in absolute terms, as noted above, i.e. in terms of whether mathematics or arithmetic or numeracy are important or useful (which of course they are), rather than bringing them into the comparative domain, where they might not do as well.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{point that}} Wittgenstein makes against the {{possibility}} of a private language involves the beetle-in-a-box thought experiment. He asks the reader to imagine that each person has a box, inside of which is something that everyone intends to refer to with the word [...] "beetle". Further, suppose that no one can look inside another's box, and each claims to know what a [...] "beetle" [...] is only by examining their own box. Wittgenstein suggests that, in such a situation, the word [...] "beetle" [...] could not be the name of a thing, because supposing that each person has something completely different in their boxes (or nothing at all) does not change the meaning of the word; the beetle as a private object [...] "drops out of consideration as irrelevant". Thus, Wittgenstein argues, if we <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> something, then <b>it</b> is not private, in the sense considered. And, contrapositively, if we consider something to be indeed private, it follows that we cannot <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
