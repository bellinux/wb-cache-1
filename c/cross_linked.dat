25|$|Many {{long-term}} {{problems with}} hip replacements {{are the result}} of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly <b>cross</b> <b>linked</b> polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.|$|E

50|$|Andersen, in 1996, {{discovered}} that the tyrosine residues are involved in chemically covalent cross-links in many forms such as dityrosine, trityrosine, and tetratyrosine. Primarily, in resilin, tyrosine and dityrosine served as the chemical cross-links, in which R groups of Tyrosine and Dityrosine add to {{the backbone of the}} growing peptide chain. Andersen came to this conclusion based on a study involving these two compounds in which he was able to rule out other forms of <b>cross</b> <b>linking</b> such as disulfide bridges, ester groups, and amide bonds. Though the mechanism of cross-linking of Tyrosine is understood that occurs through radical initiation, the <b>cross</b> <b>linking</b> of resilin still remains a mystery. <b>Cross</b> <b>linking</b> of resilin occurs very quickly and this is possibly a result of temperature. At increasing temperature, the rate of <b>cross</b> <b>linking</b> of the residues increases and leads to a highly cross-linked resilin network.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{multi-step}} biosynthesis of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase enzyme {{involves a}} variety of accessory proteins. To further understand this process, a Strep-tag II variant of the large subunit of Escherichia coli hydrogenase 3, HycE, was constructed to enable isolation of protein complexes. A complex with SlyD, a chaperone protein implicated in hydrogenase production through association with the nickel-binding accessory protein HypB, was observed. A SlyD–HycE interaction preceding both iron and nickel insertion to the enzyme was detected, mediated by the chaperone domain of SlyD, and independent of HypB. These results support a model of several roles for SlyD during hydrogenase maturation.

Optical links could have supported {{a much greater}} bandwidth and a more aggressive growth path, but microwave <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> were chosen because their bandwidth was more than sufficient for the desired system. Nevertheless, a parallel optical <b>cross</b> <b>link</b> option was carried through a critical design review, and ended when the microwave <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> were shown to support the size, weight and power requirements allocated within the individual satellite's budget. Iridium Satellite LLC has stated that their second generation satellites would also use microwave, not optical, inter-satellite communications links. Such cross-links are unique in the satellite telephone industry, as other providers do not relay data between satellites; Globalstar and Inmarsat both use a bent-pipe architecture without cross-links.|$|R
40|$|Cisplatin is an {{extremely}} effective chemotherapeutic agent used {{for the treatment of}} testicular and other solid tumours. It induces a variety of structural modifications in DNA, the most abundant being the GpG- and ApG- 1, 2 -intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> formed between adjacent purine bases. These <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> account for approximately 90 % of cisplatin-induced DNA damage and are thought to be responsible for the cytotoxic activity of the drug. In human cells, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) process removes the intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> from the genome, the efficiency of which is likely to be an important determinant of cisplatin cytotoxicity. We have investigated whether the p 53 tumour suppressor status affects global NER of cisplatin-induced intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> in human cells. We have used a (32) P-postlabelling method to monitor the removal of GpG- and ApG-intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> from two human cell models (the 041 TR system, in which p 53 is regulated by a tetracycline-inducible promoter, together with WI 38 fibroblasts and the SV 40 -transformed derivative VA 13) that each differ in p 53 status. We demonstrate that the absence of functional p 53 leads to persistence of both cisplatin-induced intrastrand <b>cross</b> <b>links</b> in the genome, suggesting that p 53 regulates NER of these DNA lesions. This observation extends the role of p 53 in NER beyond enhancing the removal of environmentally induced DNA lesions to include those of clinical origin. Given the frequency of p 53 mutations in human tumours, these results may have implications for the use of cisplatin in cancer chemotherapy...|$|R
