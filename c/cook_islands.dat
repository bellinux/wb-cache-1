5|$|In 1991, the Government of the <b>Cook</b> <b>Islands</b> {{identified}} {{the lack of}} funding for sport facilities as a key reason why the nation has not succeeded at international competitions. It believed that investing in sporting infrastructure would enable the nation to be more globally competitive. Netball was not recognised as an Olympic sport until 1995. While official recognition as an Olympic sport {{did not mean that}} it was played at the Olympics, it did mean that the national association and the <b>Cook</b> <b>Islands</b> government could then access Olympic funding to help cover costs for facilities, travel, coaching, umpire training and other grass roots development efforts. The <b>Cook</b> <b>Islands</b> Netball Association is the governing body for the sport in the <b>Cook</b> <b>Islands,</b> and historically, the sport has been administered by women. Most netball courts are owned by the local village or club. With the exception of National Auditorium, all courts are outside. In 1990, the <b>Cook</b> <b>Islands</b> Netball Association had 15 clubs affiliated with it, all based in the southern islands group, including Ngatangia/Matavera, Avatiu/Nikao, Arorangi, Titikaveka, Takuvaine, Tupapa, Outer Islands.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people have}} been {{important}} in the push to develop {{the game in the}} <b>Cook</b> <b>Islands</b> and raise the profile of the national netball team on the global stage.

5|$|The <b>Cook</b> <b>Islands</b> compete {{as a part}} of netball's Oceania region. More than 1,000 {{players have}} {{registered}} to play the sport.

Because of the level of organisation and the game's development, the country has participated at several international events including the Pacific Games, the Commonwealth Games, the World Games, the Oceania Netball Tournament, the World Youth Netball Championship, and the International Challenge Men’s and Mixed Netball Tournament.
