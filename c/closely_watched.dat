5|$|Abd al-Rahman quietly {{began to}} regroup the Ansar as a {{religious}} sect. Until 1914, he lived in seclusion in Omdurman or on Aba Island, <b>closely</b> <b>watched</b> by Slatin's intelligence agents. Despite the surveillance he built considerable influence in the White Nile region. He often visited the many mosques in Omdurman to meet his followers with his face covered so {{he would not be}} recognized by government agents. He received many visitors who sought his blessing.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{becoming}} a separate state in 1993, the Czech Republic was part of Czechoslovakia, which submitted twenty-three films for Oscar consideration between 1964 and 1991. All films chosen during this era had significant input from actors, directors and crew from the Czech Republic and several of them won the Academy Award like <b>Closely</b> <b>Watched</b> Trains in 1967 and The Shop on Main Street, a Slovak-language production from 1965.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Peruvian volcanoes such as Misti, most of the volcanoes of the CVZ are in remote areas and are not <b>closely</b> <b>watched.</b> Irruputuncu is a remote volcano; a road between Iquique and the Collahuasi mine is the main infrastructure that could be affected by future activity. In Chile, Irruputuncu is surveilled by SERNAGEOMIN, which produces regular status reports.|$|E

5|$|The Grenztruppen were <b>closely</b> <b>watched</b> {{to ensure}} that they could not take {{advantage}} of their inside knowledge to escape across the border. Patrols, watchtowers and observation posts were always manned by two or three guards at a time. They were not allowed to go out of each other's sight in any circumstances. If a guard attempted to escape, his colleagues were under instructions to shoot him without hesitation or prior warning; 2,500 did escape to the West, 5,500 more were caught and imprisoned for up to five years, and a number were shot and killed or injured in the attempt.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 Hicks {{and other}} women based on the East coast of the United States began meeting in an organization, the goal of which was to advance female {{engineers}} and increase female participation in engineering. The organization was incorporated as the Society of Women Engineers two years later. Hicks served {{as the president of}} the organization for two consecutive terms, from 1950 to 1952. In 1963 the Society of Women Engineers presented their highest honor, the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award, to Hicks. Hicks toured the United States, championing the cause of female engineers through outreach and speaking engagements. She believed that while female engineers would initially be <b>closely</b> <b>watched,</b> they would also be quickly accepted.|$|E
5|$|The {{developments}} in Uruguay were <b>closely</b> <b>watched</b> by the Empire of Brazil, which had vital {{interests in the}} Río de la Plata Basin. After Rosas fell in 1852, Brazil became the dominant regional power. Its foreign policy included the covert underwriting of opposition parties in Uruguay and Argentina, preventing strong governments that might threaten Brazil's strategic position in the area. Brazilian banking and commercial firms also had ventures in the area, furthering ties within the region. In Uruguay, the bank run by Irineu Evangelista de Sousa (Baron and later Viscount of Mauá) became so heavily involved in commercial enterprises that the economy depended on this source of continued capital flow.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Specter faced a {{challenge}} in the Republican primary election from conservative Congressman Pat Toomey, whose campaign theme was that Specter was not fiscally conservative enough. The match-up was <b>closely</b> <b>watched</b> nationally, being seen as a symbolic clash between the conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party. However, {{most of the state}} and national Republican establishment, including the state's other senator at the time, Rick Santorum, closed ranks behind Specter. Specter was supported by President George W. Bush. Specter narrowly avoided a major upset with 51% of the primary vote. Once Specter defeated the challenge from the right, he was able to enjoy great support from independents and some Democrats in his race against Hoeffel. Hoeffel trailed Specter in name recognition, campaign funds and poll results. Although the two minor candidates were seen as more conservative than Specter, they were only able to take 4% of the vote and Specter was easily reelected.|$|E
5|$|In May 1798, {{the arrest}} {{of a number of}} the leaders of the United Irishmen {{provoked}} the Irish Rebellion of 1798, a widespread uprising across Ireland. The Rebellion took the British authorities by surprise, but the introduction of regular British Army troops rapidly defeated the Irish armies and the last resistance was brought to an end in September with the surrender of a small French force at the Battle of Ballinamuck. The French authorities had also been taken by surprise by the uprising, and were consequently unprepared: the forces they deployed were inadequate to face the much larger British armies operating in Ireland at the time. News of this defeat had still not reach the continent by October, when a second French invasion force set out. <b>Closely</b> <b>watched</b> by the Royal Navy as soon as it left Brest, the squadron was defeated on 12 October 1798 at the Battle of Tory Island: fewer than a third of the French ships returned to France.|$|E
5|$|The army {{left for}} Tacuarí, being <b>closely</b> <b>watched</b> by the {{combined}} armies of Yegros and Cabañas. Those two armies had nearly three thousand soldiers, while Belgrano had barely four hundred. They were attacked from many sides during the Battle of Tacuarí, on 9 March. Greatly outnumbered and losing an unequal fight, Belgrano refused to surrender. He reorganised the remaining 235 men and ordered his secretary to burn all his documents and personal papers {{to prevent them}} from falling into enemy hands. Belgrano arranged for the troops and artillery to fire for many minutes, which made the Paraguayan soldiers disperse. When the barrage stopped, Belgrano requested an armistice, telling Cabañas that he had arrived to Paraguay to aid and not to conquer; considering the open hostility with which he was met, he would leave the province. Cabañas accepted, {{on the grounds that the}} remaining group must leave the province within a day.|$|E

5|$|The rivers were as heavily guarded {{as other}} parts of the border. On the Elbe, East Germany {{maintained}} a fleet of about 30 fast patrol boats and West Germany had some 16 customs vessels. The river border was <b>closely</b> <b>watched</b> for escapees, many of whom drowned attempting to cross. Numerous bridges blown up in the closing days of the Second World War remained in ruins, while other surviving bridges were blocked or demolished on the East German side. There were no ferry crossings and river barges were rigorously inspected by the GDR border guards. To prevent escape attempts, the East German river banks were barricaded with a continuous line of metal fences and concrete walls. At one location, Rüterberg on the Elbe, the border fortifications completely surrounded the village and sealed off the inhabitants from the rest of East Germany as well as the West.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{was then}} given command of his prize, the Duquesne, on 2 March 1804, and sailed her from Jamaica to Chatham with only 160 men. Also {{embarked}} on the Duquesne were an almost {{equal number of}} French prisoners, {{which had to be}} <b>closely</b> <b>watched</b> during the passage, in case they made an attempt to take the ship. Duquesne arrived in England without incident, and Walker paid her off for repairs. He then received command of the 36-gun HMS Thalia on 1 March 1805 and escorted convoys to the East Indies and Quebec. The voyage to the East Indies was made with two ships laden with treasure was made safely and quickly, with Walker arriving back at Spithead ten months to the day of his departure. The voyage to Quebec was made in company with two frigates, which delivered the convoy, but were delayed in port by gales until 1 December 1806. After setting sail Thalia became caught in a gale off the Newfoundland Banks and ran for 1250 miles for five days under bare poles. After returning to Spithead Walker was assigned to the Guernsey station under Sir Edmund Nagle, where he was given command of a squadron of three frigates and a brig to watch the enemy at St Malo.|$|E
