50|$|Given {{its strong}} {{oxidizing}} properties, perchloric acid {{is subject to}} extensive regulations. It is highly reactive with metals (e.g., aluminium) and organic matter (wood, plastics). On February 20, 1947, in Los Angeles California, 17 {{people were killed and}} 150 injured when a bath, consisting of over 1000 litres of 75% perchloric acid and 25% acetic anhydride by volume, exploded. The plant, 25 other buildings and 40 automobiles were obliterated and 250 nearby homes were damaged. The bath was being used to electro-polish aluminium furniture. In addition, organic compounds were added to the overheating bath when an iron rack was replaced with one coated with <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetobutyrate</b> (Tenit-2 plastic). A few minutes later the bath exploded.|$|E

The particles form during heat treatment of <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetobutyrate</b> at about 975 C and 1050 C. In AEM studies of fine-grained carbonaceous extraterrestrial materials, these particles are easily recognized...|$|E
