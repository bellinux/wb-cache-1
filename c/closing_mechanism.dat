25|$|The city of Minas Tirith, glimpsed {{briefly in}} both the {{previous}} two films, is seen fully in this film, {{and with it the}} Gondorian civilisation. The enormous soundstage was built at Dry Creek Quarry, outside Wellington, from the Helm's Deep set. That set's gate became Minas Tirith's second, while the Hornburg exterior became that of the Extended Edition's scene where Gandalf confronts the Witch-king. New structures included the 8m tall Gate, with broken and unbroken versions, with a working opening and <b>closing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> with its engravings inspired by the Baptistry of San Giovanni. There were also four levels of streets with heraldic motifs for every house, as inspired by Siena.|$|E
25|$|From {{the outside}} it is {{difficult}} to differentiate between the first three types of LRVs. There are, however, distinct features that one can use to tell them apart; Phase III LRVs still retain their original green electronic displays while all other LRVs have new orange electronic displays. Phase I cars also have a wide window at the rear that can be opened in case of an emergency, while Phase II cars have a door at the back. The interior of the phase three cars has a greenish look and the doors are also green. The Phase IV LRVs have a completely different appearance in contrast to the older phase. It has a white exterior livery with olive green and purple line on the side. The shape of the front of the LRV is more streamlined than the older phases. The door opening and <b>closing</b> <b>mechanism</b> was similar to the ones from the K-class cars used in the Tseung Kwan O line and Tung Chung line. The Phase IV has 3 surveillance cameras in each vehicle. Seat belts and wheelchair positions were also available in the Phase IV. On older-generation LRVs there is a poach seat but the Phase IVs do not maintain this feature. The Phase IV LRV has orange electronic display. The refurbished Phase I LRVs have rounded rectangular windows while Phase IV LRVs have square ones.|$|E

With the second order, the price had increased to NOK2.5 billion. Two test units were delivered in October 2005, and the serial production started in April 2006, with the first deliveries in April 2007. With the delivery of the new trains, Oslo Sporveier received criticism {{that they had been}} disloyal to the old red color of the metro, and that they did not follow up on their former design concept from the 1960s through the 80s. During the first 30 days, there occurred two errors: one in the <b>closing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the doors, and one with a switch in the cab that was not water tight. However, it turned out that Oslo Sporveier had not been accurate enough in specifying the energy consumption of the trains, and the rectifiers on parts of the line needed to be upgraded to supply sufficient power to the trains. During 2007, there were four incidents where the trains were not able to brake at stations. The worst incident occurred when a train slid the [...] from Blindern to Majorstuen.|$|E

First, the concepts of CGs are explained, and the numbers of vertices and edges in CGs are determined. Second, many different CGs are constructed from associated linkages. Based on the numbers of different edges, many CGs corresponding to the same associated linkage are grouped and the isomorphic/invalid CGs are identified and deleted. Third, many complex valid CGs are derived from simpler valid CGs or virtual CGs by adding edge.

2500|$|Ducati is {{best known}} for {{high-performance}} motorcycles characterized by large-capacity four-stroke, 90° V-twin engines, with a desmodromic valve design. Ducati refers to this configuration as L-twin because one cylinder is vertical while the other is horizontal, making it look like a letter [...] "L". Modern Ducatis remain among the dominant performance motorcycles available today partly because of the desmodromic valve design, which is nearing its 50th year of use. Desmodromic valves are closed with a separate, dedicated cam lobe and lifter instead of the conventional valve springs used in most internal combustion engines in consumer vehicles. This allows the cams to have a more radical profile, thus opening and closing the valves more quickly without the risk of valve-float, which causes a loss of power that is likely when using a [...] "passive" [...] <b>closing</b> <b>mechanism</b> under the same conditions.|$|E

Species-specific differences in jaw shape are obvious early in cichlid larval development and are correlated with patterns of bmp 4 expression in the mandibular primordium. When bmp 4 is overexpressed in the obligate suction feeder Danio rerio, mandibular morphology exhibits specific transformations of opening and closing lever ratios. We conclude that patterns of morphological integration of the cichlid jaw reflect a balance among conflicting functional demands. Further, we demonstrate that bmp 4 has the potential to alter mandibular morphology in a way that mimics adaptive variation among fish species...|$|R

50|$|Mechanical dampers {{shut the}} cross {{sectional}} area of a duct {{in the event of}} a fire either by means of pivoting a fire-resistant board (in Europe), or by means of steel shutters, similar to blinds on a window (in North America). In the European designs, the turning mechanism is fully contained, permitting the dampers (subject to type approval) to be grouted in place, which permits a heat sink effect to conduct heat from an accidental building fire, which impinges upon a duct and damper, to be conducted into surrounding structures. This also addresses the topic of smoke migration through the damper's annulus. In North American damper designs, the <b>closing</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the interior shutters resides on the outside of the damper, which is why NFPA 80 expressly prohibits the installation or presence of any materials in the damper's annulus, which are not mentioned in the manufacturer's instructions, which are governed by their certification listings. The <b>closing</b> <b>mechanism</b> must be allowed to operate, which necessitates that the annulus remain open, apart from an angle iron lip that surrounds the damper through-penetration in fire-resistance rated wall and floor assemblies. Maintenance efforts of mechanical dampers of both European and North American mechanical damper designs focus on the function of the mechanical shutting of the opening (which must be performed during inspection), as well as removal of any foreign objects that may otherwise impair this function.|$|E
