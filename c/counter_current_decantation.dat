40|$|AbstractThis paper {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> spray drying to produce engineered crystalline particles in-situ. One main feature of the <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> spray dryer is in inducing droplet drying history with a progressively increasing drying rate; {{in contrast to a}} co-current spray dryer in which the particle is immediately confronted with high driving force of evaporation. In addition, <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> dryer provides higher residence time for particles within the drying chamber. This work explored the manipulation of these unique features of <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> spray drying to control the crystallinity of the particles formed. Sucrose, lactose and mannitol were spray dried as model materials exhibit contrasting crystallization. <b>Counter</b> <b>current</b> spray drying was suitable in producing well defined crystalline lactose particles mainly due to the higher residence time. The produced lactose particles were composed of agglomeration of fine thin lactose crystals. Surprisingly, the <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> spray drying with relatively lower initial evaporation rate resulted in amorphous mannitol particles. Fully crystalline mannitol was produced when the feed spray temperature was elevated leading to rapid supersaturation. This may be an important strategy to control the crystallinity of mannitol particles particularly for pharmaceutical application. Similar feed pre-heating strategy in conjunction with <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> spray drying was used for sucrose drying. Crystalline sucrose was achieved with relatively lower drying temperature. This will be a valuable strategy for producing free flowing sucrose particles specifically for the food industry...|$|R

40|$|In the hydrometallurgical {{processing}} of nickel laterite ore, {{a significant amount}} of dissolved nickel and cobalt can be lost to neutralized tailings slurry during <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> <b>decantation.</b> Resin-in-pulp (RIP) scavenging using ion exchange resin functionalized with iminodiacetic acid (IDA) has been proposed as an effective way to recover lost metal value. However, the tendency of this resin to co-load impurities makes integration of metal value back into the plant challenging. In this paper, the application of bis-picolylamine functionalized resin to RIP scavenging is explored. Both types of resin load the valuable metals effectively but bis-picolylamine functionalized resin has a much lower affinity for unwanted impurities. After loading, selective elution of nickel and cobalt from the new resin was carried out using an ammonia based eluent. The resultant eluate was high in nickel and cobalt with ppm levels of impurities, making it appropriate for downstream integration in existing nickel/cobalt refineries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The work by H. K. Worner and {{co-workers}} at CRA in the 1960 s, and early 1970 s, established that molten metals could be refined continuously utilising <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> flow {{of metal and}} slag. Worner also demonstrated that <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> refining could produce highly refined metal products. These developments coincided {{with the advent of}} high intensity metallurgical reactors in both the ferrous and non-ferrous industries (e. g. BaS, Q-BOP and later Sirosmelt) that utilised high levels of gas injection to produce rapid stirring and very fast reaction. These new generation of high intensity metallurgical reactors allowed high tonnage rates through relatively small volume vessels. Whilst, {{it is well known that}} the <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> flow of reacting phases offers the potential of efficient mass transfer and high purity products, the application of <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> reactors to molten metal/slag systems has been criticized on the basis that they suffer from either low intensity or, alternately, from poor refining due to excessive dispersion. These criticisms relate to the balance between intensity and the refining capacity of a reactor. That is, whilst high levels of mixing transversely to the direction of flow promotes high mass transfer, longitudinal mixing (dispersion) is detrimental to refining. Of course, mixing in one direction invariably leads to mixing in other directions, thus creating a playoff between high mass transfer and excessive dispersion. This balance between intensity and refining has been the subject of recent studies overseas, and at the University of Wollongong, using cold modelling techniques to evaluate the effect of mixing on dispersion in a <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> refining launder. These studies have shown that for a given geometry and mixing regime, dispersion decreases with increasing flow of liquid phases. This means that whilst high mass transfer cannot be achieved in a refining launder without sacrificing the degree of refinement, there is no impediment to achieving high productivity through such a system, in fact, high through puts may favour good refining. Thus, it may be possible to match a high productivity smelting operation with a equally productive <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> refining stage...|$|R

Related to non-food applications, an efficient protein extraction to obtain a high protein recovery and high protein concentration with good protein functional properties is required. To achieve this, we conducted protein extractions at room temperature by using different solvents at various solvent to solid ratios and performed multistage <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> extraction to improve protein recovery and protein concentration. We obtained the highest protein recovery of 82 % by using 0. 055 M NaOH at solvent to solid ratio of 10 g/g after four-stage <b>counter</b> <b>current</b> extraction.

40|$|Biological and {{physical}} sampling of a 10 km long, east-west transect was performed during 2007, {{off the coast}} of southeast Florida. Temperature and salinity measurements were recorded using a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensor, and current direction and magnitude measurements were recorded using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). Zooplankton samples were collected, during the daytime, using a Tucker multiple net mid-water trawl, with 760 μm mesh, at intended depths of ~ 25 m and ~ 200 m, at three stations along the transect. Laboratory analysis indicated that several currents and water masses influenced the density distribution of calanoid copepods and chaetognaths. During April and September 2007, a Subsurface <b>Counter</b> <b>Current</b> existed in conjunction with an offshore meander of the Florida Current. Physical data confirmed the presence of Continental Edge Water and Yucatan Water occupying different spatial and temporal scales, and the boundary between these two water masses existed as the western boundary of the Florida Current. Temperature and salinity profiles confirmed that the Subsurface <b>Counter</b> <b>Current</b> was composed of Continental Edge Water and not Yucatan Water. Therefore, the Subsurface <b>Counter</b> <b>Current</b> observed during the transect was not a cross section of a passing eddy caused by the meandering front of the Florida Current. Densities of both taxa were highest in the Subsurface <b>Counter</b> <b>Current</b> and the Intermediate water, while the lowest densities are found in the Florida Current. Calanoid copepod and chaetognath densities exhibited typical zooplankton trends for tropical and subtropical coastal waters. Densities were highly influenced by the physical parameters of each month. Highest densities were observed in April and the lowest in July/September, typically the nutrient limited season. Analysis by location showed that the calanoid copepod and chaetognath densities were highest inshore and decreased offshore. The Florida Current exhibited the lowest densities for both taxa, while the Subsurface <b>Counter</b> <b>Current</b> and Intermediate water had higher densities. Previously documented southward flow had been associated with an offshore meander of the Florida Current, but during May and July there was a Subsurface <b>Counter</b> <b>Current</b> and an onshore meander of the Florida Current. Densities of both taxa were still lowest in the Florida Current. The stable isotope values of the zooplankton were skewed because of the preservation media and {{it was not possible to}} determine if the currents and water masses were isotopically different, and thus creation of a correction factor for the preservation effect was not possible.
