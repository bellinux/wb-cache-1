Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) combines modern laser spectroscopy with the exciting optical properties of metallic structures, resulting in strongly increased Raman signals when molecules {{are attached to}} micrometersized structures.

40|$|Abstract. Deformation {{of glass}} using heat occurs in many {{industrial}} and artistic applications, including the manufacturing of laboratory glass products, drawing of fiber optics, and hand-blown artistic creations. The formation of glass objects is an art, but the trial-and-error {{aspect of the}} procedures can be reduced by development of a systematic theory, especially when the objects are formed using mechanical means. Glass microelectrodes are ubiquitous in experimental studies of the electrophysiology of biological cells and their membranes, and the “pulling ” of these electrodes is based on trial-and-error. To make this process more systematic, we derive a model for glass microelectrode formation using a <b>coil</b> <b>heater</b> with a gravity-forced electrode puller, assuming that the glass tube is an incompressible, viscous fluid. The model is one-dimensional, {{and the effects of}} thermal radiation from the <b>coil</b> <b>heater</b> are essential in the formation process. A breaking stress criterion is imposed to fracture the glass tube, forming the electrode tip. The difficulty with the moving free end is avoided by introducing a quasi-Lagrangian coordinate system. The model equations are solved using an adaptive moving grid to account for the local stretching of the glass. A number of examples using a double-pull paradigm have been computed to illustrate the dependence of the electrode shape and tip diameter on the heater temperature and the ratio between the inner and outer radii...|$|E

40|$|Ignition of {{electrical}} wires by external heating is investigated {{in order to}} gain a better understanding of the initiation {{of electrical}}-wire fires. An ignition-to- spread model is developed to systematically explain ignition and the following transition to spread. The model predicts that for a higher-conductance wire it is more difficult to achieve ignition and the weak flame may extinguish during the transition phase because of a large conductive heat loss along the wire core. Wires with two metal-core materials, nichrome and copper having three different diameters, with polyethylene coatings of three different thicknesses are employed and a <b>coil</b> <b>heater</b> was adopted as the ignition source in the experimental study. Experiments show that additional heating times after flash are required in order to fully pass the transition and achieve a spreading flame, agreeing with model predictions. In addition, the effects of different heating lengths, ambient pressures and oxygen concentrations on wire ignition are discussed. Steady flame spread horizontally along thin electrical wires in normal and oxygen-enriched oxygen/nitrogen atmospheres is also investigated both theoretically and experimentally {{to gain a better understanding}} of the development of in electrical fires occurring in normal and modified environments.

40|$|Gas {{bearings}} in oil-free micro-turbomachinery for {{process gas}} applications and for power generation (< 400 kW) must offer adequate load capacity and thermal stability, reliable rotordynamic performance {{at high speeds}} and temperatures, low power losses and minimal maintenance costs. The metal mesh foil bearing (MMFB) is a promising foil bearing technology offering inexpensive manufacturing cost, large inherent material energy dissipation mechanism, and custom-tailored stiffness and damping properties. This dissertation presents predictions and measurements of the dynamic forced performance of various high speed and high temperature MMFBs. MMFB forced performance depends mainly on its elastic support structure, consisting of arcuate metal mesh pads and a smooth top foil. The analysis models the top foil as a 2 D finite element (FE) shell supported uniformly by a metal mesh under-layer. The solution of the structural FE model coupled with a gas film model, governed by the Reynolds equation, delivers the pressure distribution over the top foil and thus the load reaction. A perturbation analysis further renders the dynamic stiffness and damping coefficients for the bearing. The static and dynamic performance predictions are validated against limited published experimental data. A one-to-one comparison of the static and dynamic forced performance characteristics of a MMFB against a Generation I bump foil bearing (BFB) of similar size, with a slenderness ratio L/D= 1. 04, showcases the comparative performance of MMFB against a commercially available gas foil bearing design. The measurements of rotor lift-off speed and drag friction at start-up and airborne conditions are conducted for rotor speeds up to 70 krpm and under identical specific loads (W/LD = 0. 06 to 0. 26 bar). The dynamic force coefficients of the bearings are estimated, in a ?floating bearing? type test rig, while floating atop a journal spinning to speeds as high as 50 krpm and with controlled static loads (22 N) applied in the vertical direction. The parameter identification is conducted in the frequency range of 200 - 400 Hz first, and then up to 600 Hz using higher load capacity shakers. A finite element rotordynamic program (XLTRC 2) models a hollow rotor and two MMFBs supporting it and predict the synchronous rotor response for known imbalances. The predictions agree well with the ambient temperature rotor response measurements. Extensive rotor response measurements and rotor and bearing temperature measurements, with a <b>coil</b> <b>heater</b> warming up to 200 ?C and placed inside the hollow rotor, reveal the importance of adequate thermal management.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} multifunctional MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical System) sensor system for the simultaneous measurement of pressure and temperature inside a hydraulic system, more specifically a hydraulic brake system for automotive applications. The multifunctional pressure and temperature sensor system presented in this Thesis was designed to be installed in a new brake-by-wire system that requires the simultaneous reading of pressure and temperature per wheel cylinder. This system needs to control and monitor these parameters at each wheel cylinder to adjust the pressure for optimal braking. Current sensing systems installed in regular brake systems use a single pressure sensor that is positioned in the main cylinder and they do not include a temperature sensor. Moreover, while numerous approaches have been taken to control and monitor the pressure in a brake system real-time, no MEMS sensor system has yet been reported that can carry out real-time measurements of the brake system's pressure and temperature. 	In a representative automobile hydraulic brake system, the pressure and temperature can reach up to about 4 Mpa and 120 °C, respectively. These conditions are developed in an oily environment with a pH ~ 11. The multifunctional sensor system presented here is based on the two sensors, one for pressure and one for temperature, working within the same packaging. These two sensors are glued on the surface of an adequate Transistor Outline (TO) base using a temperature resistance adhesive. The substrate with the two sensors is covered by a parylene layer for dielectric protection, protection from the corrosive medium and protection from the moisture inherent in the brake fluid. The interface of the sensor system to the hydraulic brake system uses a commercial 1 / 4 18 NPT fitting customized to serve as an interface as well as a metal shell between the sensor and the hydraulic cylinder. The TO base and the metal shell were joined by micro-brazing to minimize heat-affected areas and ensure that critical components are unharmed. A finite element model to understand the effect of the parylene layer on the performance of the sensors was developed using COMSOL Multiphysics®. The model was validated by testing many prototypes of the developed sensor system using a custom made hydraulic hand pump which pressure is monitored by a digital hydraulic pressure gauge. The sample fitting is covered by a <b>coil</b> <b>heater</b> that includes a type -T Thermocouple positioned close to the sample to monitor the temperature. The complete apparatus allowed characterization of the test sensor from room pressure (13 psi) to 500 psi over a temperature range of 25 to 120 °C. The test samples were characterized from atmospheric pressure to 450 psi over a temperature range of 25 to 120 °C. The experimental data shows a reduction in pressure sensitivity of 18. 2 % due to the parylene layer which closely agrees with the model predictions of a reduction of 21 %. In summary, a multifunctional sensor system has been developed {{that can be used to}} control and monitor the pressure and temperature of a hydraulic cylinder real-time. The sensor system is novel in that it measures both parameters at a single point real-time with good sensitivity and accuracy making it ideal for applications in brake-by-wire systems...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} performance, {{efficiency}} {{and safety of}} future equipment’s in commercial, aerospace, nuclear and defense structures, worldwide efforts are being directed towards the development of novel materials which exhibit superior structural and multifunctional capabilities in extreme environments. Fundamental investigation into the thermo-mechanical response and dynamic failure of the materials is paramount {{before they can be}} incorporated into the design of future space access vehicles that can operate reliably in combined, extreme environments. For this purpose, a comprehensive study was conducted to evaluate the performance of variety of materials such as Ti 2 AlC, Ti 3 AlC 2, Hastelloy X and 2024 Aluminum under extreme thermo-mechanical loadings. ^ An experimental investigation was conducted to evaluate the compressive constitutive behavior and fracture initiation toughness of fine grained (~ 4. 2 µm) Ti 2 AlC in dynamic and quasi-static loading at different temperatures. A Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) apparatus was used in conjunction with an induction coil heating system for dynamic experiments at elevated temperatures. A series of experiments were conducted at different temperatures from 25 °C to 1200 °C and strain rates of 10 - 4 s- 1 and 500 s- 1. A single edge notched specimen was used to determine the fracture initiation toughness in dynamic and quasi-static loading from ambient temperature to 900 °C. The SHPB apparatus was modified for this purpose and high speed photography was incorporated to calculate the dynamic fracture toughness. The results from these experiments reveal that the peak compressive failure stress in dynamic conditions decreases with increases in temperature, from 1600 MPa at room temperature to 850 MPa at 1200 °C. In the dynamic testing condition, the failure remains predominately brittle even at temperatures as high as 1200 °C. However, brittle-to-plastic transition was observed at around 900 °C under quasi static loadings. The fracture experiments reveal that the dynamic fracture toughness is higher than the quasi-static value by approximately 35 %. The effect of grain size on the constitutive behavior of Ti 2 AlC from room temperature to 1100 °C under dynamic and quasi-static loading was also investigated using high density Ti 2 AlC samples of three different grain sizes. The results show that under quasi-static loading the specimens experience a brittle failure for temperatures below Brittle to Plastic Transition Temperature (BPTT) of 900 – 1000 °C and pseudo-plastic behavior at temperatures above the BPTT. During dynamic experiments, the specimens exhibited brittle failure, with the failure transitioning from catastrophic failure at lower temperatures to graceful failure at higher temperatures, and with the propensity for graceful failure increasing with increasing grain size. The compressive strengths of different grain sizes at a given temperature are related to the grain length by a Hall-Petch type relation. ^ Experimental studies were then conducted to investigation of mechanical response and fracture toughness of Ti 3 AlC 2 under dynamic loading at different temperatures. SHPB apparatus in conjunction with an induction <b>coil</b> <b>heater</b> were used to dynamically load the specimen at various temperatures. The results of this study reveal that Ti 3 AlC 2 exhibits brittle failure during dynamic loading, even for temperatures of 1100 °C. The peak compressive stress for failure decreased with increasing temperatures. The fracture toughness was also seen to decrease with increasing temperature. The SEM images indicate that under dynamic loading conditions the deformation behavior and fracture mechanisms do not change with temperature. ^ The constitutive behavior of Hastelloy X was evaluated over a wide range of strain rates. Shear compression specimen (SCS) geometry was utilized to achieve strain rates from 10 - 3 – 20000 s - 1. A screw driven testing machine and a SHPB apparatus were used to load the specimens. An induction coil heating system was utilized in conjunction with SHPB to evaluate constitutive behavior at elevated temperatures under dynamic loading. Room temperature experiments were carried out at varying strain rates from 10 - 3 – 20000 s- 1 exhibit the strain rate sensitivity of Hastelloy X. The rate sensitivity increases after rate exceeds 1000 s- 1. The stress stain curves at various temperatures under dynamic loading showcase a yield strength anomaly. The stress peaks at the beginning of dynamic yielding at 850 °C and 1000 °C. ^ An experimental investigation was conducted to understand the effect of curvature on blast response of aluminum panels under extreme temperatures. Three aluminum 2024 -T 3 panels: flat panel and two curved panels, with radii of curvatures of 304. 8 mm and 111. 8 mm were used for the study. A shock tube apparatus was utilized to impart controlled shock loading. Propane flame torches were used to heat the specimens and experiments were conducted at 25 °C, 200 °C and 350 °C. High speed photography coupled with 3 D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique was used to obtain full field deflection and velocity, as well as in-plane strain on the back face of the panels. The different modes of deformation and the mode transitions during the blast loading of the three panels have been identified. The effect of temperature on the deformation modes is investigated. The deflections of panel with 304. 8 mm radius of curvature were found to be higher than the other two panels. With increase in temperature, the deflections increased and strain was seen to get localized. ^ Experiments were performed to study the shear banding phenomenon in Ti 6 Al 4 V. SCS of Ti 6 Al 4 V were used in this of study the formation and evolution of adiabatic shear bands. The gage section of specimen was speckled using high temperature paint and SHPB apparatus will be used to dynamically load the SCS of Ti 6 Al 4 V. High speed photography was used to capture the deformation of speckled specimen. The high speed images were analyzed using DIC software to extract the strain fields during shear banding. Before dynamic failure localization in strain field were noticed. These localizations indicate towards formation of shear bands. ...|$|E

Therefore, the capacity of the components to be tested inside the wind tunnel is limited by the combined capacity of the cooling <b>coil,</b> <b>heaters,</b> and the steam injection system.

These two models, HSM 01 and HSM 02, used insulated NbTi Rutherford cable wound onto stainless steel rings with spliceless transitions between <b>coils.</b> Strip <b>heaters</b> were included for quench protection of each coil, and the coils were epoxy-impregnated after winding inside the support structures. Based {{on the results of}} the first model the second model was made using a cable with optimized cross-section, improved winding and epoxy-impregnation procedures, enhanced ground insulation, and included heat exchange tubing for a test of conduction cooling. We report on the results and lessons learned from fabrication and tests of these two models...|$|R
40|$|A 1. 5 T superconducting MRI magnet {{has been}} {{developed}} in our laboratory. A passive quench protection system is employed to avoid the damage through the quench event. The coils are subdivided into several groups and a heater network is implemented accordingly. With the control volume method, the numerical model of the quench time is introduced. Different design schemes of the heater strip are compared. The simulation results of currents and voltages are illustrated and the temperature rise of the <b>coils</b> and the <b>heaters</b> are discussed...|$|R
50|$|When the {{transmission}} signal was {{seen on the}} input, the gas would rapidly ionize (helped by a <b>heater</b> <b>coil</b> or radium). The free electrons in the plasma presented an almost perfect impedance source, blocking the signal from flowing to the output. As soon as {{the transmission}} stopped, the gas de-ionized and the impedance disappeared very rapidly. The tiny echoes caused by reflections from the target, arriving microseconds later, were far too small to cause the ionization, and allowed the signal to reach the output.|$|R
50|$|Insulation is used {{to prevent}} the Nichrome coil to contact the sheath. If such event happened, it would ground the {{resistance}} and potentially produce a catastrophic short-circuit, resulting in a melted sheath and a major equipment failure. Damage can be mitigated by installing a ground fault interrupting circuit. To prevent the coil from touching the sheath, the coil is inserted into the sheath, and immediately filled with Magnesium Oxide (MgO). To ensure the MgO fills the empty space between the sheath and the <b>coil,</b> the cartridge <b>heater</b> is filled under vibration.|$|R
40|$|The {{document}} (in Italian) {{is part of}} {{a series}} of reports dealing with the design, the construction and the operation of the PIPER-ONE loop installed at the Scalbatraio Laboratory managed by DCMN (Dipartimento di Costruzioni Meccaniche e Nucleari – previously IIN, Istituto di Impianti Nucleari) of University of Pisa. PIPER-ONE was built in Italy {{as a consequence of the}} Three-Mile accident (1979) : it aimed at simulating the Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) performance following Small Break Loss of Coolant Accidents (SBLOCA). The natural circulation which occurs between down-comer and core into the vessel constitutes the reference thermal-hydraulic phenomenon which needed to be simulated. The concerned document allowed the finalization of the thermal-hydraulic design of a key peculiarity of the PIPER-ONE loop: the concerned peculiarity is the passive structure cooling/heating system. Any experimental loop (namely those characterized by full height scaling and full pressure) suffer of the scaling distortion caused by the high value of the ratio ‘passive structure area / volume of fluid’ which ends up (unavoidably) to be 10 – 50 times the ideal value which characterizes the prototype. As a consequence of this timing of accident is distorted too. Unavoidable (again) heat losses to environment contribute further to distortion in performance between prototype and model. It might be noted that during some period of an assigned transient scenario (e. g. during the depressurization time) passive structure transfer too much thermal power to the fluid (e. g. related to the ideal value or the value expected in the prototype); otherwise during long lasting transient heat losses cause too much thermal power removal from the fluid also distorting the natural circulation.. Cooling coils (e. g. a pipe welded around the entire loop) and electrical heating wire were wrapped around the passive structure of PIPER-ONE to optimize the scaling performance. The current report describes the design features of both the electrical <b>coils</b> (<b>heaters)</b> and the cooling coils (coolers). The PIPER-ONE loop was used for an International Standard Problem (ISP) by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) / Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) / Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations (CSNI) during the middle of 80 ’s. The design and the operation of the loop constituted a milestone achievement in the area of nuclear thermal-hydraulics with main reference to the scaling...|$|R
5000|$|Lower {{temperatures}} {{may cause}} a heat pump to operate below {{the efficiency of}} a resistance heater, so conventional heat pumps often include <b>heater</b> <b>coils</b> or auxiliary heating from LP or natural gas to prevent low efficiency operation of the refrigeration cycle. [...] "Cold climate" [...] heat pumps are designed to optimize efficiency below 0 °F. In the case of cold climates, water or {{ground source heat pumps}} are the most efficient solution. They use the relatively constant temperature of ground water or of water in a large buried loop to moderate the temperature differences in summer and winter and improve performance year round. The heat pump cycle is reversed in the summer to act as an air conditioner ...|$|R
