The Committee's main goal was to ensure that the Soviet Union continued as a highly centralised union state.

Defenceman Doug Harvey was unanimously elected in 1973, one year after being denied entry due to his drinking habits.

Guy Lafleur was one of three players in NHL history (along with Gordie Howe and Mario Lemieux) to return to playing after being elected. Lafleur, who had first retired in 1984 after growing frustrated with the Canadiens' defence-focused system, returned to the league days after his 1988 election, playing for the New York Rangers and Quebec Nordiques before finally retiring in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Since 1954, a {{year ahead}} of the 1955 general election, an Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) has been {{appointed}} to advise the executive on the number and geographical division of electoral divisions. Even though neither the Constitution nor any law requires this to be done, the Prime Minister has continued to do so from Singapore's independence in 1965. This is generally done just before a general election to review the boundaries of electoral divisions and recommend changes. In recent decades, the <b>Committee</b> <b>has</b> been chaired by the Cabinet Secretary and has had four other members who are senior public servants. In the EBRC appointed before the general election of 2006, these were {{the head of the}} Elections Department, the Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore Land Authority, the Deputy CEO of the Housing and Development Board and the Acting Chief Statistician. Since the Committee is only convened shortly before general elections, the preparatory work for boundary delimitation is done by its secretariat the Elections Department, which is a division of the Prime Minister's Office.|$|E
5|$|The EBRC's {{terms of}} {{reference}} are issued by the Prime Minister, and are not embodied in legislation. In giving recommendations for boundary changes over the years, the <b>Committee</b> <b>has</b> considered various factors, including using hill ridges, rivers and roads as boundaries rather than arbitrarily drawn lines; {{and the need for}} electoral divisions to have approximately equal numbers of voters so that electors' votes carry the same weight regardless of where they cast their ballots. In 1963, the EBRC adopted a rule allowing the numbers of voters in divisions to differ by no more than 20%. The permitted deviation was increased to 30% in 1980. It is up to the Cabinet {{to decide whether or not}} to accept the Committee's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|The Executive <b>Committee</b> <b>has</b> {{ultimate}} {{authority over}} all policy {{decisions of the}} LSA. The Committee is composed of 12 members, 11 of which have voting privileges.

The remaining seven positions are specifically elected and held {{by members of the}} LSA. One is a student member, elected to a two-year term, while the remaining six are full members elected to three year terms. The elections for the three-year terms are staggered, with two members elected each year. The Executive Director is nominated by the Executive Committee and appointed by the President. They serve as the Chief Administrative Officer, overseeing the Society's application and adherence to policies, and report directly to the Executive Committee.|$|E
