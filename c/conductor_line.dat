In this case, large stretchability must also be provided by these thin metal <b>conductor</b> <b>lines.</b> The adhesion of the <b>conductor</b> <b>lines</b> to the rubber substrate is of major importance from a reliability point of view. Experimental observations show that delamination between the metal <b>conductor</b> <b>lines</b> and the stretchable substrate may eventually lead to shortcircuits while also the delaminated area could result in cohesive failure of the metal lines. To understand and quantify the behavior of the copper-rubber interface, peel tests are performed and analyzed by means of experiments and numerical simulations. Interestingly, experimental observations show that the rubber is severely lifted at the delamination front caused by its high compliance. To quantify theinterface properties, numerical simulations of the peel test have been performed by developing a finite element model comprising of cohesive zone elements by which the transient delamination process during the peel test is described in detail. By means of an extensive model parameter sensitivity study combined with the measured peel-force curves and the rubber-lift geometry at the delamination front, the final set of model parameters has been determined. Finally,the thus obtained model parameters are used to simulate the delamination behavior of actual three-dimensional stretchable electronics samples loaded in tension...|$|R

40|$|Wafer {{processing}} involves several heating cycles to temperatures {{as high as}} 400 C.

The model is solved for typical process steps and the kinetics and extent of void growth are determined for each. It is shown that grain size, void spacing, and <b>conductor</b> <b>line</b> width are very important in determining void and stress behavior. For small grain sizes, stress relaxation can be rapid and can lead to void shrinkage during subsequent heating cycles. The effect of rapid quenching from process temperatures is to suppress void growth but induce large remnant stress in the <b>conductor</b> <b>line.</b> This stress can provide the driving force for void growth during storage even at room temperature.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{examines}} how the increased density of passivated metallic <b>conductor</b> <b>lines</b> caused by large circuit integration in semiconductor devices influence their reliability during a thermal-cycling test. It {{was found that}} {{a decrease in the}} size of the trench-shaped space formed between two passivated <b>conductor</b> <b>lines</b> reduces the thermal cycling reliability of the passivation layer (i. e. in this case, consisting of Si 3 N 4). The increased depth of the trenches results in more severe deformation in the surrounding area and brittle fractures in the passivation layer. In particular, the present work indicates that as the ratio of trench depth to trench width increases from 1 : 1 to 5 : 1, the number of failures caused by thermal cycling increases up to 2 -fold. Numerical calculation also shows that the region of maximum stress is found at the corner of the interface between the flat passivation layer (i. e., the surface without any trenches) and its underlying metallic conductor. In cases where trenches exist, however, the region of maximum stress shifts from the interface corner to the trench corner. Furthermore, the level of the maximum stress was calculated to be lower at the interface corner than the trench corner, by 11 %...|$|R
