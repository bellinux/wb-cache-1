40|$|There {{is growing}} {{recognition}} that operational research (OR) should be embedded into national disease <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> However, {{much of the}} current OR capacity building schemes are still predominantly driven by international agencies with limited integration into national disease <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> We demonstrated {{that it is possible}} to achieve a more sustainable capacity building effort across the country by establishing an OR group within the national tuberculosis (TB) <b>control</b> <b>programme</b> in Indonesia. Key challenges identified include long-term financial support, limited number of scientific publications, and difficulties in documenting impact on programmatic performance. External evaluation has expressed concerns in regard to utilisation of OR in policy making. Efforts to address this concern have been introduced recently and led to indications of increased utilisation of research evidence in policy making by the national TB <b>control</b> <b>programme.</b> Embedding OR in national disease <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> is key in establishing an evidence-based disease <b>control</b> <b>programme...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, many {{regional}} and country-wide <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> for Johne's disease (JD) were developed due to associated economic losses, {{or because of}} a possible association with Crohn's disease. These <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> were often not successful, partly because management protocols were not followed, including the introduction of infected replacement cattle, because tests to identify infected animals were unreliable, and uptake by farmers was not high enough because of a perceived low return on investment. In {{the absence of a}} cure or effective commercial vaccines, control of JD is currently primarily based on herd management strategies to avoid infection of cattle and restrict within-farm and farm-to-farm transmission. Although JD <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> have been implemented in most developed countries, lessons learned from JD prevention and <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> are underreported. Also, JD <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> are typically evaluated in a limited number of herds and the duration of the study is less than 5 year, making it difficult to adequately assess the efficacy of <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> In this manuscript, we identify the most important gaps in knowledge hampering JD prevention and <b>control</b> <b>programmes,</b> including vaccination and diagnostics. Secondly, we discuss directions that research should take to address those knowledge gap...|$|R

The programme consists of a 5 -day semenology workshop, during which participants receive intensive training on issues such as sperm concentration, motility, vitality and morphology. Following the workshop, all the participants are enrolled in a continuous quality <b>control</b> (CQC) <b>programme</b> for sperm morphology. These workshops and quality <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> are presented by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Tygerberg Hospital (South Africa) in conjunction with the World Health Organization's (WHO) Special Programme for Research Development and Research Training. Seventy individuals from 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have been trained since 1997; 58 of these are still participating in the quality <b>control</b> <b>programme.</b> Using the results from the quality <b>control</b> <b>programme,</b> participants were classified according to their sperm morphology reading skills recorded over an extended period.

40|$|BACKGROUND—There is some {{evidence}} that tobacco companies marketing efforts undermine the effects of comprehensive tobacco <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b>  OBJECTIVE—To determine whether point-of-purchase advertising and promotions are more pervasive in states where comprehensive tobacco <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> are underway.  DESIGN—Cross sectional survey using 1996  data, with merged records of the existence of local tobacco advertising restrictions.  PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING— 581 tobacco retail stores located in close proximity to high schools in mainland USA.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Existence of gift-with-purchase, number of interior advertisements, and exterior store advertisements for Marlboro cigarettes.  RESULTS—After controlling for store type and existence of advertising restrictions, offer of a gift-with-purchase for Marlboro cigarettes was significantly more likely in states with comprehensive tobacco <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> than those without programmes (odds ratio 2. 59,  95 % confidence interval 1. 57  to 4. 26). Although not significant, results show {{an increase in the number}} of interior and exterior store advertisements for stores located in states with a comprehensive tobacco <b>control</b> <b>programme</b> than those in other states.  CONCLUSION—Results suggest some point-of-purchase tobacco promotions and advertising are more pervasive in states with comprehensive tobacco <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> These efforts are likely to act against the objectives of programmes and need to be accounted for in programme evaluations.    Keywords: advertising; public policy; value added promotion...|$|R

40|$|Integrated vector {{management}} (IVM) {{is defined}} as "a rational decision-making process for the optimal use of resources for vector control" and includes five key elements: 1) evidence-based decision-making, 2) integrated approaches 3), collaboration within the health sector and with other sectors, 4) advocacy, social mobilization, and legislation, and 5) capacity-building. In 2004, the WHO adopted IVM globally for the control of all vector-borne diseases. Important recent {{progress has been made}} in developing and promoting IVM for national malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> in Africa at a time when successful malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> are scaling-up with insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and/or indoor residual spraying (IRS) coverage. While interventions using only ITNs and/or IRS successfully reduce transmission intensity and the burden of malaria in many situations, it is not clear if these interventions alone will achieve those critical low levels that result in malaria elimination. Despite the successful employment of comprehensive integrated malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes,</b> further strengthening of vector control components through IVM is relevant, especially during the "end-game" where control is successful and further efforts are required to go from low transmission situations to sustained local and country-wide malaria elimination. To meet this need and to ensure sustainability of control efforts, malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> should strengthen their capacity to use data for decision-making with respect to evaluation of current vector <b>control</b> <b>programmes,</b> employment of additional vector control tools in conjunction with ITN/IRS tactics, case-detection and treatment strategies, and determine how much and what types of vector control and interdisciplinary input are required to achieve malaria elimination. Similarly, on a global scale, there is a need for continued research to identify and evaluate new tools for vector control that can be integrated with existing biomedical strategies within national malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> This review provides an overview of how IVM programmes are being implemented, and provides recommendations for further development of IVM to meet the goals of national malaria <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> in Africa...|$|R
40|$|Since 2004 the West African {{countries}} of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have implemented national schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> with financial and technical {{support from the}} Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI). In {{the first three years}} of the <b>control</b> <b>programmes,</b> nearly 13 · 5 million doses of praziquantel and albendazole have been administered against schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis with coverage rates varying between 67 · 0 % and 93 · 9 %. These treatments have resulted in a reduction of the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma infection in the sentinel cohorts that were set up to monitor and evaluate the national <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> The challenges currently faced by these national <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> are the ability to maintain the reduction in morbidity achieved thus far due to the mass treatment campaigns and ensuring sustainability. For reinforcement of surveillance, the establishment of a geographical information system is suggested in order to contribute towards enhanced sustainability of these programmes. Our new working hypothesis is that targeted control accompanied by periodic mass treatment campaigns (every two to three years) can contribute to maintaining the low levels of morbidity achieved thus far. The implementation of integrated neglected tropical disease <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> in these countries will provide means to ensure the financial sustainability of control activities for the years to come...|$|R
