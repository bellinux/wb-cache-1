2500|$|Ulysse was an epic poem in free verse, {{the first}} such work in Fondane's career, and testing a format later adopted in Titanic and L'Exode. Although quite similar to Voronca's own work, which also used Homer's Odyssey as the pretext for a comment on social alienation, it {{included}} an additional allegory of Jewishness (according to critic Petre Răileanu, Voronca had stripped his own text of Jewish symbolism, {{in the hope of}} not entering a competition with Fondane). Fondane's 1933 text echoes his earlier intertextual Homeric references (present in poems he wrote back in 1914), but, to their adventurous escapism, it opposes the Ithaca metaphor—an ideal of stability in the assumption of one's destiny. Claude Sernet referred to Ulysse as [...] "painful and sober, a cry of anxiety, of revolt and resignation, a fraternal and noble song to mankind". The poem is also Fondane's comment on the Wandering Jew story (the mythical figure is rescaled into an urban Ulysses), and, according to cultural historian Andrei Oișteanu, reinterprets the Christian prejudice about Jews being eternal [...] "witnesses" [...] of Christ's Passion. Together, such motifs intimated the writer's own experiences, leading various commentators to conclude that he too was [...] "the Jewish Ulysses".

Star Trek Online executive producer Daniel Stahl said Ihle's design inspired the creative team, presenting a familiar silhouette yet evolving the franchise's ship design. Similarly, Simon & Schuster held a contest to design the USS Titan, a science vessel commanded by William Riker about whom a series of novels has been published. Sean Tourangeau's design won the contest, which was scored on originality, execution, consistency with the publisher's <b>concept</b> <b>notes,</b> and consistency with Star Treks established Starfleet style.

40|$|Each year, donors channel $ 7. 6 {{billion into}} HIV {{programming}} in affected countries. With this funding often comes significant control over interventions at country level, {{though there is}} considerable skepticism {{about the value of}} donor-driven strategies. Locally conceived approaches are believed to be more effective, but it is not always clear that donors are responding accurately or appropriately to the priorities of communities. <b>Concept</b> <b>notes</b> submitted to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria by eight African countries were systematically measured to determine their responsiveness to community priorities. National Civil Society Priorities Charters were used as a measure of community-identified needs. Malawi’s concept note was by far the most responsive to civil society priorities and Zambia’s was the least. The <b>concept</b> <b>notes</b> were the most responsive to civil society priorities on key populations’ issues, and the least responsible on priorities related to voluntary medical male circumcision. Statistically significant relationships were found between the responsiveness of Global Fund <b>concept</b> <b>notes</b> and Afrobarometer indicators on democracy, participation and civic engagement. There was also a significant relationship found between the voice and accountability rankings from the World Governance Indicators. This makes a compelling case to show that a context of democracy is linked to civil society’s ability to influence HIV/AIDS funding decisions at national level. Understanding the factors which hinder or enable community-led program development is critical for a more effective HIV response...|$|E

40|$|The CaDEC {{strategy}} has been to use territorial development concepts implemented in ESPON reports {{as a vehicle to}} capitalize and disseminate ESPON results to stakeholders across various member states. To attract stakeholders interest on ESPON reports, a limited number of people called ‘target group members’ were selected in each participating country that occupy strategic positions in their professional environment. These people would serve as springboards for further dissemination and capitalization. The target group members subsequently filled in a questionnaire in order to identify the general level of knowledge and use of ESPON in the country and to estimate the needs of stakeholders as regards knowledge on ESPON concepts. Starting from an analysis of the answers to the questionnaire, project partners were able to attune their dissemination strategy to the needs of stakeholders. This step was important to identify and select a list of concepts and the ESPON reports dealing with the very same concepts. Brief and operational <b>concept</b> <b>notes</b> were then drafted in national languages. The delivery of these briefs on concepts became a cornerstone to the dissemination process of CaDEC. It directly supported the different members of the target groups by providing them with a tangible and accessible means by which to further disseminate ESPON results. With <b>concept</b> <b>notes</b> as a basis for the discussions, stakeholders were asked to react on both on the concepts and on ESPON reports during national workshops. This feedback has allowed to assess, both for concepts and for the ESPON reports, their understanding, their actual and potential uses, their needs and the level of dissemination. Although the activities took place at the national and sub-national level, the approach taken in the CaDEC project has been fundamentally transnational. This was achieved by a synthesis of the analysis of the questionnaire and by means of transnational workshops, which aimed to identify common features in terms of dissemination, uses and needs...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{existing}} literature, {{the role of}} experience of risk on attitudinal and behavioural risk response has been relatively neglected. Recent research that draws on the psychological distance of climate change as a <b>concept</b> <b>notes</b> the importance of local, significant experience as a driver for encouraging appropriate response. The experience of flooding {{was used as the}} stimulus in this paper, and emphasis placed on whether direct and/or indirect experience of flood risk is associated with different responses to climate change risk. In order to explore the relationship between climate change risk experience and response in the form of on-farm mitigation and adaptation, this paper draws on a case study of farmers in England, many of whom have experienced flooding. Results from a quantitative survey undertaken with 200 farmers in Gloucestershire, England are discussed. Statistical analysis found experience of flooding to be significantly associated with a heightened concern for climate change. Although also finding an association between experience and behavioural response, the sample were most likely to be taking adaptive behaviour as part of normal practice, with factors such as lack of overall concern for climate change risk and absence of information and advice likely to be the main barriers to action. Risk communication needs to further emphasise the connection between climate change and extreme weather events to allow for farmers to perceive climate change as a relevant and locally salient phenomenon, and subsequent tailored information and advice should be offered to clearly illustrate the best means of on-farm response. Where possible, emphasis must be placed on actions that also enable adaptation to other, more immediate risks which farmers in this study more readily exhibited concern for, such as market volatility...|$|E

The UNISDR Science and Technology Conference on the Implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 – 2030 aimed to discuss and endorse plans that maximize science’s contribution to reducing disaster risks and losses in the coming 15  years and bring together the diversity of stakeholders producing and using disaster risk reduction (DRR) science and technology. This article describes the evolution of the role of science and technology in the policy process building up to the Sendai Framework adoption that resulted in an unprecedented emphasis on science in the text agreed on by 187 United Nations member states in March 2015 and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly in June 2015. Contributions assembled by the Conference Organizing Committee and teams including the conference <b>concept</b> <b>notes</b> and the conference discussions that involved a broad range of scientists and decision makers are summarized in this article. The conference emphasized how partnerships and networks can advance multidisciplinary research and bring together science, policy, and practice; how disaster risk is understood, and how risks are assessed and early warning systems are designed; what data, standards, and innovative practices would be needed to measure and report on risk reduction; what research and capacity gaps exist and how difficulties in creating and using science for effective DRR can be overcome. The Science and Technology Conference achieved two main outcomes: (1) initiating the UNISDR Science and Technology Partnership for the implementation of the Sendai Framework; and (2) generating discussion and agreement regarding the content and endorsement process of the UNISDR Science and Technology Road Map to 2030.|$|E
