40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between perceived overprotection and the psychological states of cerebral palsy patients and their primary <b>caretakers</b> in Hong Kong. Design: Cross-sectional survey, in which data of 14 pairs of cerebral palsy patients and their <b>caretakers</b> were analysed. Setting: Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital, Hong Kong. Participants: Cerebral palsy patients and their primary <b>caretakers</b> in Hong Kong. Main outcome measures: Perceived overprotection and psychological states. Results: Nearly {{two thirds of the}} 14 patients (mean age of 15 years) and 86 % of the 14 primary <b>caretakers</b> (mean age of 47 years) perceived various levels of overprotection. For both patients and <b>caretakers,</b> perceived overprotection was positively associated with anxiety and unhappiness. The patients' and caretakers' psychological states and perception of overprotection were not related to the actual motor ability of the patients. Perceived overprotection of the patients was not related to that of the <b>caretakers.</b> Conclusion: <b>Caretakers</b> should be mindful that a well-meaning move may have undesirable consequences.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{factors associated}} with <b>caretaker's</b> readiness to disclose an HIV diagnosis to their child, a prospective study was conducted among <b>caretakers</b> of HIV-infected children aged seven to 16 years who were receiving care at two paediatric HIV treatment centres in Bangkok. <b>Caretakers</b> were offered readiness preparation counselling and their perceptions on disclosure were assessed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Among <b>caretakers</b> {{who had participated in}} the readiness preparation process for at least one year, 71 % (195 / 273) were ready for disclosure. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that child's age of nine years or older, child's severe immunosuppression, <b>caretakers</b> having prior discussion with their child about the illness, <b>caretaker's</b> perception that their child had the ability to understand the HIV diagnosis and to keep it secret, and <b>caretaker's</b> opinion that the proper age for disclosure is between seven and 12 years old were associated with <b>caretaker's</b> readiness for disclosure. These determinants may be useful for guiding disclosure readiness preparation counselling. CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2015 - 12 - 28 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 24598978 PMC 469280...|$|R

40|$|Zinc {{treatment}} for diarrhoea can shorten {{the course and}} prevent future episodes among children worldwide. However, knowledge and acceptability of zinc among African mothers is unknown. We identified children aged 3 to 59 months, who had diarrhoea within {{the last three months}} and participated in a home-based zinc treatment study in rural Kenya. <b>Caretakers</b> of these children were enrolled in two groups; zinc-users and non-users. A structured questionnaire was administered to all <b>caretakers,</b> inquiring about knowledge and appropriate use of zinc. Questions on how much the <b>caretakers</b> were willing to pay for zinc were asked. Proportions were compared using Mantel-Haenszel test, and medians were compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Among 109 enrolled <b>caretakers,</b> 73 (67 %) used zinc, and 36 (33 %) did not. Sixty-four (88 %) <b>caretakers</b> in zinc-user group reported satisfaction with zinc treatment. <b>Caretakers</b> in the zinc-user group more often correctly identified appropriate zinc treatment (98 %- 100 %) than did those in the non-user group (64 - 72 %, p< 0. 001). <b>Caretakers</b> in the zinc-user group answered more questions about zinc correctly or favourably (median 10 of 11) compared to those in the non-user group (median 6. 3 of 11, p< 0. 001). <b>Caretakers</b> in the zinc-user group were willing to pay more for a course of zinc in the future than those in the non-user group (median US$ 0. 26, p< 0. 001). <b>Caretakers</b> of children given zinc recently had favourable impressions on the therapy and were willing to pay for it in the future.

30|$|Indeed, optimal {{communication}} between different <b>caretakers</b> {{is a second}} important factor in patient care: all relevant information on the patient’s unique situation should be clearly and fully communicated not only among the treating physicians [organ specialists, surgeons, general practitioners (GPs), anesthesiologists, etc.] but also equally important between surgeons and the other <b>caretakers</b> (nurses, pharmacy, logistics, etc.) {{in the hospital and}} between hospital <b>caretakers</b> and those taking care of the patient before and after hospital discharge. The optimization of the patient’s condition for surgery should start in primary care: general practitioners can play a major role by identifying potential risks of morbidity (anemia, obesity, suboptimal diabetic control, reduced renal function, etc.).

40|$|Background and Aim: The role of <b>caretakers</b> at {{day-care centers}} {{has become more}} {{imperative}} in promoting oral health care in children since many new mothers opt to work outside their homes, leaving their children at day-care centers. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of oral health promoting factors among secondary <b>caretakers</b> of children attending day-care centers. Settings and Design: This was a cross-sectional exploratory study conducted among secondary <b>caretakers</b> in Kubang Kerian, Malaysia. Materials and Methods: Thirty-four <b>caretakers</b> fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria participated in the study. The data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire addressing various aspects of knowledge, attitude and practice of oral health in children. Analysis was done using SPSS version 12. 0. Results: The knowledge of factors causing dental caries was found to be good among majority of the <b>caretakers,</b> but the concepts of transmissibility of caries and effect of hidden sugars were not evident. Seventy one percent did not know that frequent bottle feeding could cause tooth decay. Attitudes seemed to be governed by the cultural practices of the region rather than the knowledge obtained. The knowledge was not translated to practice adequately. Giving sweetened liquid in bottles was practiced by 53 &#x 0025; of the <b>caretakers.</b> Conclusion: Implementation of nursery-based oral health promotion programs for secondary <b>caretakers</b> is needed to counteract early childhood caries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} care-seeking {{practices of}} mother <b>caretakers</b> with children {{less than five}} years of age in a rural district of Sri Lanka. The study was carried out from June to September 1998, documenting care-seeking practices of mother <b>caretakers</b> in a population of 2248 children in 60 villages. Of the five targeted diseases in the IMCI programme (Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses) that were the focus of the study, acute respiratory infections (82. 0 %) and diarrhoea (14. 8 %) were predominant. Although malnutrition was highly prevalent it was not recognised by mother <b>caretakers</b> as an illness. Findings show that in 65. 0 % of illness episodes in children the mother <b>caretakers</b> sought outside care and treatment. <b>Caretakers</b> sought treatment from both private and public sectors with the majority seeking care in the private sector. Care seeking of mother <b>caretakers</b> was driven by symptomology. Young children with higher perceived severity and high-risk symptoms were brought to provider care more frequently, although a large percentage of episodes with low-risk symptoms were also brought for outside care. Care seeking was similar across socio-economic groups. The study points out that high care seeking of mother <b>caretakers</b> in Sri Lanka, particularly for illnesses with acute high-risk symptoms and signs, is a plausible explanation for the low level of childhood mortality despite the prevalence of a high rate of malnutrition.
