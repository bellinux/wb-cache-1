40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{two-stage}} silicone-rod {{technique for}} flexor-tendon replacement {{was performed in}} the forepaws of twenty-four mongrel dogs and {{in the hands of}} four chimpanzees. The graft and sheath complex was studied at intervals from two weeks to one year after the second-stage replacement, by injection of the vascular tree with silicone compound and by histological techniques. Revascularization was well developed by four to six weeks after replacement. At four to six months, parietal and visceral sheaths, connected by an elastic areolar membrane, were well differen-tiated and highly vascularized. The reticular mesotenon served as a non-restricting, gliding bridge <b>conveying</b> <b>vessels</b> to and from the tendon. Many longitudinal and transverse connecting vessels were present in the closely adherent, thin, transparent epitenon (visceral layer). These vessels, as well as intratendinous vessels, were pres-ent throughout {{the entire length of the}} tendon, which in the chimpanzee is as long as a human flexor tendon. Successful restoration of the function of a lacerated finger flexor tendon continues to be a surgical dilemma. For a repaired tendon or free tendon graft to heal, there must b...|$|R

40|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} of the ileum {{associated with}} Peyer's patches begins with lymph entering a single lacteal of the villus, probably through intercellular flaps, which prevent retrograde {{flow to the}} interstitium. These lacteals are continuous with an interconnecting plexus of branching sinuses which surrounds the crypts and follicle domes in the lamina propria. Small vessels emanating from this plexus penetrate the muscularis mucosa, where lymph can either flow within septal vessels to the deep submucosa, or enter the follicular sinuses to move freely around follicles, and through gaps in septal walls. All lymph enters a deep submucosal network where retrograde flow is prevented by valves. Lymph is then <b>conveyed</b> through <b>vessels</b> passing between the fibres of the muscularis externa to other lymphatics, which transport lymph from the ileal surface to the mesenteric nodes...|$|R
40|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} {{from the}} wall of the distal small intestine, important especially in young sheep as a major site of gut-associated lymphoid tissue, begins with a series of longitudinally oriented subserosal <b>vessels.</b> These <b>vessels</b> <b>convey</b> lymph to the mesenteric border of the intestinal wall and unite to form larger vessels which course through the mesentery to the mesenteric lymph nodes. These nodes lie towards the periphery of a broad, fan-shaped mesentery, adjacent to major arteries and veins. Mesenteric <b>vessels</b> <b>convey</b> lymph from the jejunum and part of the proximal ileum to the jejunal nodes. Lymph from most of the ileum is conveyed to caecal nodes. The larger mesenteric lymphatics have well formed smooth muscle and connective tissue layers surrounding the endothelium. They are often adjacent to, but rarely within, the connective tissue band anchoring the major arteries and veins to one or both lamellae of mesentery. Few anastomoses occur between vessels from opposing sides of the gut wall or the mesentery. Afferent lymphatics enter the subcapsular and trabecular sinuses of the nodes over most surfaces apart from the hilar region. Lymph flows through cortical tissue to the medulla, which occupies most of the node. In the medulla, sinuses occur within medullary cords as well as between them. Initial efferent lymphatics occur throughout medullary tissue. Efferent vessels emerge at a hilus then coalesce and drain into the jejunal or ileal trunk. The hilus of the node varies from a flat, poorly defined area on the lesser curvature, to a depression or groove. The latter commonly occurs in elongated jejunal nodes.

5|$|In vertebrates, {{the part}} of the brain that plays the {{greatest}} role is the hypothalamus, a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function. The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood <b>vessels,</b> <b>conveying</b> information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.|$|R

Whether he learned that Caesar was advancing in that direction with a force too strong for him to encounter, or found that the people were disinclined to espouse his cause, or whether the whole movement was a feint to direct Caesar's attention to Macedon as the field of his operations, in order that he might escape more secretly and safely beyond the sea, can not now be ascertained.|$|R
40|$|Blood {{vessels are}} {{critical}} to deliver oxygen and nutrients {{to all of the}} tissues and organs throughout the body. The blood vessels that vascularize the central nervous system (CNS) possess unique properties, termed the bloodâ€“brain barrier, which allow these vessels to tightly regulate the movement of ions, molecules, and cells between the blood and the brain. This precise control of CNS homeostasis allows for proper neuronal function and also protects the neural tissue from toxins and pathogens, and alterations of these barrier properties are an important component of pathology and progression of different neurolog-ical diseases. The physiological barrier is coordinated by a series of physical, transport, and metabolic properties possessed by the endothelial cells (ECs) that form thewalls of the blood vessels, and these properties are regulated by interactions with different vascular, immune, and neural cells. Understanding how these different cell populations interact to regulate the barrier properties is essential for understanding how the brain functions during health and disease.

40|$|BackgroundUnderstanding {{the female}} breast fascial system is of {{paramount}} importance in breast surgery. Little was written about breast ligaments. Most articles refer to Cooper's work without further anatomical studies. Lately, a horizontal septum has been described <b>conveying</b> nerves and <b>vessels</b> to the nipple areola complex. MethodsDuring the surgical dissection of {{the lower part of the}} breast, in supero-medial technique for breast reduction operations, a fascial septum between the lower two quadrants was detected. This fibrous septum was studied through anatomic dissection of breast tissues during routine breast reshaping procedures that was done on 30 female patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed preoperatively in all cases and correlated with the intraoperative findings. In the other five cases, outside the clinical study, the imaging was done during routine investigation for breast swellings. ResultsA vertical septum was identified in the lower part of the breast, lying at the breast meridian between the two lower quadrants. It is a tough bi-laminated structure that extends from the middle of the infra-mammary crease caudally to nipple-areola complex cranially and from the pectoral fascia posteriorly to the overlying skin anteriorly. This was proved by MRI findings. ConclusionsThis study describes a new inferior vertical septum which separates the lower half of the breast into two definite anatomical compartments: medial and lateral...|$|R
40|$|The tonsil of {{the soft}} palate, the {{predominant}} lymphoid tissue of the oropharynx in pigs, is important especially in initiating immune responses against antigenic material entering the mouth. The aim of this work was to describe the lymphatic pathways from the tonsils {{of the soft}} palate of pigs through lymph nodes of the head to the bloodstream. This was achieved by gross dissection, and by using Evans' Blue dye and Microfil casts. Efferent lymphatic vessels from the tonsil coalesce to form <b>vessels</b> which <b>convey</b> lymph to the primary nodes, the mandibular and medial retropharyngeal, and thence to the bloodstream, along two distinct pathways. In the superficial pathway, lymph flows through the mandibular lymph node, along lymphatic vessels {{closely associated with the}} linguofacial vein, to the ventral superficial cervical node (middle group) and the accessory mandibular node. Most efferent vessels from the accessory mandibular node enter the ventral superficial cervical node, but some may directly join the lymphatic vessels emanating from the ventral superficial cervical node. These <b>vessels</b> <b>convey</b> lymph to the dorsal superficial cervical node and thence, via the efferent lymphatics, to the circulatory system. In the deep pathway, lymph is conveyed directly to the medial retropharyngeal node and then to the tracheal trunk, as in other domestic animals.

60|$|These {{things were}} done {{in the first year}} of his reign, An. Nabonass. 573. And thenceforward he {{forecast}} his devices against the strong holds of Egypt, until the sixth year. For three years after, that is in the fourth year of his reign, Menelaus bought the high-Priesthood from Jason, but not paying the price was sent for by the King; and the King, before he could hear the cause, went into Cilicia to appease a sedition there, and left Andronicus his deputy at Antioch; in the mean time the brother of Menelaus, to make up the money, <b>conveyed</b> several <b>vessels</b> out of the Temple, selling some of them at Tyre, and sending others to Andronicus. When Menelaus was reproved for this by Onias, he caused Onias to be slain by Andronicus: for which fact the King at his return from Cilicia caused Andronicus to be put to death. Then Antiochus prepared his second expedition against Egypt, which he performed in the sixth year of his reign, An. Nabonass. 578: for upon the death of Cleopatra, the governors of her son the young King of Egypt claimed Phoenicia and Coelosyria from him as her dowry; and to recover those countries raised a great army. Antiochus considering that his father had not quitted the possession of those countries[8], denied they were her dowry; and with another great army met and fought the Egyptians on the borders of Egypt, between Pelusium and the mountain Casius. He there beat them, and might have destroyed their whole army, but that he rode up and down, commanding his soldiers not to kill them, but to take them alive: by which humanity he gained Pelusium, and soon after all Egypt; entring it with a vast multitude of foot and chariots, elephants and horsemen, and a great navy. Then seizing the cities of Egypt as a friend, he marched to Memphis, laid the whole blame of the war upon EulÃ¦us the King's governor, entred into outward friendship with the young King, and took upon him to order the affairs of the kingdom. While Aniochus was thus employ'd, a report being spread in Phoenicia that he was dead, Jason to recover the high-Priesthood assaulted Jerusalem with above a thousand men, and took the city: hereupon the King thinking Judea had revolted, came out of Egypt in a furious manner, re-took the city, slew forty thousand of the people, made as many prisoners, and sold them to raise money; went into the Temple, spoiled it of its treasures, ornaments, utensils, and vessels of gold and silver, amounting to 1800 talents; and carried all away to Antioch. This was done in the year of Nabonassar 578, and is thus described by Daniel. [9] And he shall stir up his power, and his courage against the King of the South with a great army; and the King of the South shall be stirrd up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they, even Antiochus and his friends, shall forecast devices against him, as is represented above; yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat, shall betray and destroy him, and his army shall be overthrown, and many shall fall down slain. And both these Kings hearts shall be to do mischief; and they, being now made friends, shall speak lyes at one table, against the Jews and against the holy covenant; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end, in which the setting up of the abomination of desolation is to prosper, shall be at the time appointed. Then shall he return into his land with great riches, and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall act, against it by spoiling the Temple, and return into his own land.|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of archaeological rescue works before the A 1 {{motorway}} building in 2008 in Nowa WieÅ› site 6, WÅ‚ocÅ‚awek commune, relics of a late medieval and modern manorial farm and a late medieval manor house were recognized. The most numerous group of artifacts included crushed pottery from among which 12 fragments of so-called Hussite pottery have been distinguished (table I, II). The fragments come from at least 6 containers, including 5 wheel-made ones, made of clay with an admixture of ne-grained sand and one fragment from strongly lathed vessel made of identical ceramic mass as the wheel-made vessels. The containers in the passage between the belly and the short, weakly accentuated necks were decorated with horizontal bands of impressed {{with the use of}} a knurl letters. The preserved edge parts of most probably 4 pots have similarly shaped rims (table I: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, II: 1 â€“ 4, 9). During the ring in reducing atmosphere all the fragments became grey (RAL 7033) to dark grey (RAL 7012) on their inner and outer surfaces. The fractures were 0. 3 â€“ 0. 5 cm thick, in 8 cases were one-coloured (g. 2 : 1), grey (RAL 7033) or darkgrey (RAL 7012), in other cases â€“ two-coloured (g. 2 : 2) with grey-light brown centre (RAL 8001). On all the specimens not big chips in places of white grains of marl or gypsum occurrence were registered (g. 3). No special dispersion of the artifacts has been stated at the site. Only 1 fragment was explored in a pit (object A 219), in the lling containing materials of chronology dened as the 16 th century. The other were registered in objects and cultural layer, which occurred in the late modern period, in llings containing materials dated to the 15 th to 18 th centuries. A characteristic ornament of letters, letter-like signs and letters impressed with a rotary stamp in the described collection appears in 4 variants (g. 4). In 2 cases a full turn of the knurl consists of a row of 5 letters (variants II and III; g. 5 : 1, 2), in one case â€“ 6 signs (variant IV; g. 5 : 3). In the collection from Nowa WieÅ› most frequent capital letters are: S in a mirror image, G u-turned, M turned left or right at a right angle, B written properly and u-turned, and D impressed properly or u-turned. In the period of the spread of the Hussite ideas in Kuyavia certain sequences of capital letters registered on <b>vessels</b> <b>conveyed</b> denite content to the initiated people. With time, signs transferred by potters {{with the use of a}}nother knurls became only symbols of religious-social movements (in the 16 th century), and later they were only kinds of decoration (cf. Kajzer 1988, 1994; Andrzejewska 1997). It should be emphasized that on one fragment in metopes some signs have been recognized, which accompanied an inscription "maria", registered on a late medieval vessel from Kozi HrÃ¡dek in Czech. What is also worth attention is a complicated geometrical ornament and a horizontal band formed by 10 wavy parallel lines identied on a bowl (table III: 1, 2), direct analogies to which are found on late medieval vessels decorated with inscriptions from Czech. Probably not only letters made with the use of a knurl should be treated as an ornament typical of so-called Hussite pottery...|$|R

He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate--short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate {{of the land of}} song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religi{{on to the}} hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to <b>convey</b> these <b>vessels</b> when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and {{it is safe to say}} that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing fiancÃ©e an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.
