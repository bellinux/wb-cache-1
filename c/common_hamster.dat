In this study, we tested the effects of food stores high in fat content, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), on hibernation patterns under laboratory conditions. Control animals received standard rodent pellets only, while in the other group pellets were supplemented with sunflower seeds. We recorded body temperature during winter using subcutaneously implanted data loggers, documented total food consumption during winter, and analysed PUFA proportions in white adipose tissue (WAT) before and after the winter period. About half of the individuals in both groups hibernated and torpor expression did not differ between these animals. Among the high-fat group, however, individuals with high sunflower seeds intake strongly reduced the time spent in deep torpor. PUFA proportions in WAT decreased during winter in both groups and this decline was positively related to the time an individual spent in deep torpor. Sunflower seeds intake dampened the PUFA decline resulting in higher PUFA levels in animals of the high-fat group after winter. In conclusion, our results showed that <b>common</b> <b>hamsters</b> adjusted torpor expression and food intake in relation to the total energy of food reserves, underlining the importance of food hoard quality on hibernation performance...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the timing and}} duration of hibernation as well as body temperature patterns in free-ranging <b>common</b> <b>hamsters</b> (Cricetus cricetus) with regard to sex and age differences. Body temperature was recorded using subcutaneously implanted data loggers. The results demonstrate that although immergence and vernal emergence sequences of sex and age groups resembled those of most hibernators, particularly adult females delayed hibernation onset until up to early January. Thus, in contrast to other hibernators, female <b>common</b> <b>hamsters</b> hibernated for shorter periods than males and correspondingly spent less time in torpor. These sex differences were absent in juvenile hamsters. The period between the termination of hibernation and vernal emergence varied among individuals but did not differ between the sex and age groups. This period of preemergence euthermy was related to emergence body mass: individuals that terminated hibernation earlier in spring and had longer euthermic phases prior to emergence started the active season in a better condition. In addition, males with longer periods of preemergence euthermy had larger testes at emergence. In conclusion, females {{have to rely on}} sufficient food stores but may adjust the use of torpor in relation to the available external energy reserves, whereas males show a more pronounced energy-saving strategy by hibernating for longer periods. Nonetheless, food caches seem to be important {{for both males and females}} as indicated by the euthermic preemergence phase and the fact that some individuals, mainly yearlings, emerged with a higher body mass than shortly before immergence in autumn...|$|R

The fur is moderately long and very soft, and has a silk-like gloss; the deep golden yellow colouring extends over the upper parts and sides of the head and body, and also over the outer side of the limbs: on the back the hairs are brownish at the tip, hence in this part the fur assumes a deeper hue than {{on the sides of the}} body: the sides of the muzzle, throat, and upper parts of the body are white, but faintly tinted with yellow: on the back, and sides of the body, all the hairs are of a deep grey or lead colour at the base. The feet and tail are white. The ears are of moderate size, furnished externally with deep goldern-coloured hairs, and internally with whitish hairs. The moustaches consist of black and white hairs intermixed. [...] In 1839 at a meeting of the London Zoological Society George Robert Waterhouse described the Syrian hamster as a new species. His identification of the animal happened after his 1835 appointment as a curator of the museum of the London Zoological Society, where his job was to process mammal specimens. The body in the museum became the type specimen for the new species. There is no record of who collected the specimen nor is there any record of who donated the body to that museum. In 1853 the British Museum purchased the collections of the London Zoological Society, so now, this original hamster is in the British Museum as specimen BM(NH) 1855.12.24.120. Some derivative works of the Waterhouse publication which also presented the existence of the hamster were Louis Fraser's 1849 Zoologia Typica, Christoph Gottfried Andreas Giebel's 1855 Säugetiere, and Henry Baker Tristram's 1884 Fauna and Flora of Palestine.|$|E

40|$|The spatial genetic {{structure}} of <b>common</b> <b>hamsters</b> (Cricetus cricetus) was investigated using three partial mitochondrial (mt) genes and 11 nuclear microsatellite loci. All marker systems revealed significant population differentiation across Europe. Hamsters {{in central and}} western Europe belong largely to two allopatric mitochondrial lineages south and northwest of the Carpathian and Sudetes. The southern group, 'Pannonia', comprises populations inside the Carpathian basin (Czech Republic, Hungary) while the second group, 'North', includes hamsters from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and Germany. Isolation of the lineages is maintained {{by a combination of}} geographical and ecological barriers. Both main phylogeographical groups show signs of further subdivision. North is separated into highly polymorphic central German and less polymorphic western populations, which most likely split during late glacial expansion (15 00010 000 bp). Clock estimates based on haplotype distributions predict a divergence of the two major lineages 85 000147 000 bp. Expansion times fall during the last glaciation (115 00010 000 bp) corroborating fossil data, which identify Cricetus cricetus as characteristic of colder climatic phases. Despite the allopatry of mt haplotypes, there is an overlap of nuclear microsatellite alleles between phylogeographical units. Although there are strong evidence that Pannonian hamsters have persisted inside the Carpathian basin over the last 50 000 years, genetic differentiation among European hamsters has mainly been caused by immigration from different eastern refugia.

40|$|The <b>Common</b> <b>hamster</b> Cricetus cricetus was an {{agricultural}} pest in {{large parts of}} Europe less than 50 years ago. Currently the species is highly threatened or locally extinct and acknowledged as an important and even iconic species for nature conservation in farmland areas in Western Europe. The species was listed in the European habitats directive in 1992 to prevent a further decline, but the <b>Common</b> <b>hamster</b> is still declining {{in most parts of}} its European range despite large conservation efforts. Only a few local conservation successes have been reported so far. These disappointing conservation results raise the question: why is it so difficult to conserve this former pest species? Farming practices have been intensified in Europe and this has resulted in a more efficient way of harvesting cereals in combination with a strong reduction of spring sown cereals in favour of winter sown cereals. It is possible that these changes have become an important threat for survival of populations of this species. We developed both a deterministic and a stochastic population model for {{a better understanding of the}} current way of harvesting on the population ecology of this species and evaluated the effects of using different litter sizes on population growth and persistence.

2500|$|As {{with the}} least weasel, mouse-like rodents predominate in the stoat's diet. However, unlike the least weasel, which almost {{exclusively}} feeds on small voles, the stoat regularly preys on larger rodent and lagomorph species, and will take down individuals far larger than itself. In Russia, its prey includes rodents and lagomorphs such as European water voles, <b>common</b> <b>hamsters,</b> pikas, and others, which it overpowers in their burrows. Prey species of secondary importance include small birds, fish, and shrews and, more rarely, amphibians, lizards, and insects. In Great Britain, European rabbits are an important food source, with the frequency in which stoats prey on them having increased between the 1960s and mid 1990s {{since the end of}} the myxomatosis epidemic. Typically, male stoats prey on rabbits more frequently than females do, which depend to a greater extent on smaller rodent species. British stoats rarely kill shrews, rats, squirrels and water voles, though rats may be an important food source locally. In Ireland, shrews and rats are frequently eaten. In mainland Europe, water voles make up a large portion of the stoat's diet. Hares are sometimes taken, but are usually young specimens. In North America, where the ecological niche for rat and rabbit sized prey is taken by the larger long-tailed weasel, the stoat preys on mice, voles, shrews, and young cottontails. In New Zealand, the stoat feeds principally on birds, including the rare kiwi, kaka, mohua, yellow-crowned parakeet, and New Zealand dotterel. Cases are known of stoats preying on young muskrats.

Besides the rats and the <b>Common</b> <b>Hamster,</b> the Hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor) and the European Hare (Lepus europaeus) were {{an important component of the}} diet. Smaller mammals, reptiles, birds and arthropods made up a small portion of the diet in terms of biomass. The diet composition, compared to similar studies, suggests the possible importance of habitat complexity and prey species diversity for the maintenance of eagle owl populations. The results suggest that the Eurasian Eagle Owl is also capable of exploiting species well adapted to urban environments...|$|E
40|$|In anthropogenically {{disturbed}} habitats, natural barriers {{still exist}} {{and have to}} be recognized, as they are important for conservation measures. Areas of phylogeographic breaks within a species are often stabilized in inhospitable regions which act as natural barriers. An area of contact between phylogeographic lineages of the <b>common</b> <b>hamster</b> (Cricetus cricetus) was found in the Małopolska Upland in Poland. A total of 142 common hamsters were captured between 2005 and 2009. All hamsters were genotyped at 17 microsatellite loci and partial sequences of the mitochondrial (mtDNA) control region were obtained. No mixed populations with mtDNA haplotypes of both lineages were found. The distance between marginal populations was about 20  km; no hamsters were found in the area between. A principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on microsatellite data and the greatest change in PC 1 scores was found between marginal samples. To define the habitat components responsible for the phylogeographic break, we compared the habitat composition of sites occupied by hamsters with those from which hamsters were absent. We found that hamsters avoided forested areas and sandy soils. The area of the potential barrier was characterized by a high proportion of woodland and unfavorable soils in comparison with neighboring areas inhabited by hamsters. They cannot settle in this area due to their high winter mortality in shallow burrows and high predation in the fields adjacent to forests...|$|E

Some sera only reacted with the tumor-associated cell-surface antigen (TASA) of SV 40 -transformed cells. Other sera also reacted {{with a common}} antigen found in non-SV 40 tumor cells but not in normal spleen cells. Only TASA {{was found to be}} correlated with the tumor-associated transplantation antigen. Although all sera reacted with various SV 40 -transformed cells, they had different pat-terns of reactivity. These results indicate that the SV 40 TASA may be composed either of different molecules or of single molecules with several antigenic determinants. -J Natl Cancer Inst 52 : 815 - 821, 1974. SIMIAN VIRUS 40 (SV 40) -transformed cells possess an antigen specific for SV 40 -induced tumors and absent in non-SV 40 -induced tumors, which has been demonstrated both in in vivo and in vitro (1 - 6). Recently, <b>common</b> antigens in <b>hamster</b> SV 40 tumors were found to be shared by both SV 40 tumors and non-SV 40 cells, e. g., Forssman antigen (7), organ-specific antigens (8), antigen uncovered by trypsin treatment (9), and fetal antigen (10, 11). Immuniza-tion with fetal tissue was also reported to weakly protect hamsters against SV 40 tumor (12). The present study shows that immunizing with SV 40 tumor cells elicits antibodies reacting against both the SV 40 tumor-associated cell-surface antigen (TASA) and also against common antigen(s). We also investigate the relationship of these antigens to SV 40 tumor-associated transplantation antigen (TA...|$|R
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{properties of}} the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), {{the site of the}} main circadian pacemaker in mammals, have recently been studied in vitro by means of organotypic slice culturing. So far, only neonatal rats and mice have been used for such developmental and functional analyses of the isolated pacemaker. Here, the authors present a comparative developmental study of the SCN of voles, rats, and hamsters in organotypic slice cultures. In contrast to strictly circadian organization of behavior in rats and <b>hamsters,</b> <b>common</b> voles (Microtus arvalis) are characterized by large variability in the strength of circadian organization of behavior. It is not known to what extent this variability is reflected in the intrinsic features of the SCN. Cultures were prepared from rat, hamster, and vole pups (6 to 9 days old) for the purpose of species comparison. In addition, the authors studied the relation between age and development in cultures from pup (7 to 10 days old), juvenile (15 to 16 days old), and young adult (1 to 2 months old) voles. In contrast to the situation in rat and hamster, the most striking feature in neonatal voles is the variability in shape of the final, fully developed culture and its poor resemblance with the in vivo SCN. The SCN of adult voles, however, could be cultured successfully while retaining its morphological organization seen in situ. Phase-contrast microscopy and immunocytochemical staining for vasopressin and glial fibrillary acidic protein revealed that cultures of pup and juvenile voles still have potential for neurogenesis and morphological reorganization. Young voles, therefore, can serve as a model to study the developmental establishment of a functional circadian pacemaker, while adult voles allow the study of intrinsic pacemaker properties in relation to previously recorded behavior of the donor and aging-related pacemaker dysfunction. ...|$|R
3000|$|..., respectively) for the {{microsatellites}} in the examined {{populations are}} in the same order of X[*]>[*]P[*]>[*]W[*]>[*]Zh populations. Correspondingly, the density of the populations was in the similar sequence of X[*]>[*]P[*]>[*]W[*]>[*]Zh populations. As shown in Figure  2, an obvious correlation can be inferred between the levels of genetic diversity and the population density. Our results are in accordance with studies in other species in which a similar correlation was found (Aspi et al. [2006]; Berthier et al. [2006]; Eckert et al. [2008]; Frankham [1996]; Furlan et al. [2012]; Montgomery et al. [2000]; Wang et al. [2013]), including other rodents (Krebs [2013]) and hamster species (Romanenko et al. [2007]), like the greater long-tailed hamster (Dong et al. [2010]; Xie and Zhang [2006]; Xu et al. [2013 a]; Xue et al. [2014]), the golden hamster (Karsten et al. [2005]), and the <b>common</b> <b>hamster</b> (Banaszek et al. [2012]; Neumann et al. [2005]). Similarly, the genetic diversity of the striped hamster has experienced a trend of continuous decline in recent years. However, the genetic distance of the striped hamster correlates partially with geographical distance, while it is more greatly influenced by environmental factors. Strong fluctuations in population density can lead to loss of genetic diversity, and in return, reduction in genetic diversity and inbreeding depression can significantly lower the ability of populations to adapt to changing environments, eventually leading to extinction (Frankham [1996]). Therefore, maintenance of genetic diversity is an essential issue of conservation.|$|E
