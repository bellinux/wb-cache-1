40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} Navier-Stokes solver {{developed for}} {{detailed study of}} wave rotor flow dynamics is described. The CFD model is helping characterize important loss mechanisms within the wave rotor. The wave rotor stationary ports and the moving rotor passages are resolved on multiple computational grid blocks. The finite-volume form of the thin-layer Navier-Stokes equations with laminar viscosity are integrated in time using a four-stage Runge-Kutta scheme. The Roe approximate Riemann solution scheme or the computationally less expensive Advection Upstream Splitting Method (AUSM) flux-splitting scheme are used to effect upwind-differencing of the inviscid flux terms, using cell interface primitive variables set by MUSCL-type interpolation. The diffusion terms are central-differenced. The solver is validated using a steady shock/laminar boundary layer interaction problem and an unsteady, inviscid wave rotor passage gradual opening problem. A model inlet port/passage charging problem is simulated and key features of the unsteady wave rotor flow field are identified. Lastly, the medium pressure inlet port and high pressure outlet port portion of the NASA Lewis Research <b>Center</b> experimental <b>divider</b> cycle is simulated and computed results are compared with experimental measurements.

50|$|U.S. Representative Hal Rogers was the forerunner {{in getting}} the tolls lifted on the Daniel Boone Parkway, {{securing}} $13 million in federal funding. Former governor Paul E. Patton, {{to thank him for}} removing the tolls on the highway, renamed the Daniel Boone Parkway the Hal Rogers Parkway. This stirred a lot of controversy among Kentucky residents and descendants of Daniel Boone who were offended that the famous pioneer, who helped settle Kentucky, was renamed for a sitting congressman whose main accomplishment was getting the tolls lifted off of the parkway. Soon after, the Associated Press picked up the controversy regarding the renaming of the parkway and outrage over the renaming has been heard across the United States {{and as far as the}} United Kingdom. The toll booths were dismantled soon after the tolls were removed on June 1 of 2003, and new Hal Rogers Parkway signs replaced the Daniel Boone Parkway signs. The two at-grade toll booths at exits 34 and 44 were converted into regular intersections and the mainline toll booth near London was dismantled. It is the only parkway in the state of Kentucky to be almost exclusively two-lanes with the occasional truck lanes on the hills. There is a <b>center</b> paint <b>divider</b> with rumble strips added as a safety feature.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a monolithically-integrated, broadband, lumped-element, symmetrical-hybrid power <b>divider</b> <b>centered</b> at 20 GHz {{which was designed}} and fabricated to uniformly distribute power to arrays of Josephson junctions for superconducting voltage standards. This solution achieves a ten-fold decrease in chip area, and a two-fold increase in bandwidth when compared to a standard distributed 180 ◦-hybrid by utilizing LC Π sections and a coplanar-waveguide phase inverter instead of transmission lines. A single divider demonstrates 0. 5 dB maximum insertion loss, and a 1. 5 : 1 VSWR bandwidth of 13 – 23 GHz. An eight-way, three-level, binary, power divider network is characterized in a divider/attenuator/combiner back-to-back measurement configuration with a 20 dB match bandwidth from 11. 5 – 21. 5 GHz. In the 15 – 22 GHz band of interest, the maximum insertion loss for the sixteen-way divider network is 1. 0 dB, {{with an average of}} 0. 5 dB.

In use, each piece may be used individually, or as a unitary three-compartment mess tray, {{accomplished}} by sliding the lid-plate's <b>center</b> <b>divider</b> onto the folding handle, and securing it to the handle by the ring-and-latch mechanisms. When latched, the kit can be held in a ready position by the user in one hand to receive U.S. Army's 'A' or 'B' field kitchen rations. As the soldier passed along the mess line, food service personnel would dole out hot items first, often meat followed by vegetables, potatoes and other side dishes, ostensibly separated by the tray dividers. Dessert was piled in the center of the accumulated portions — if the soldier was lucky. While a soldier could use the handled Meat Can Body from his kit to cook raw food, it is really too shallow and thin to serve as an effective skillet, and was usually restricted to heating the canned Meat Ration. After 1938, the Meat Can Body was used to heat the meat and vegetable component of the C-ration, or to reconstitute breakfast items such as C-ration powdered eggs.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn Drosophila, RotundRacGAP/RacGAP(84 C) is {{critical}} to retinal organisation and spermatogenesis. We show that eye-directed expression of RacGAP(84 C) or its GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain induces a dominant rough eye phenotype which we used {{as a starting point}} in a gain-of-function screen to identify new partners of RacGAP(84 C). Proteins known to function in Ras, Rho and Rac signalling were identified confirming the essential role of RacGAP(84 C) in crosstalk between GTPases. Other potential RacGAP(84 C) partners identified by the screen are implicated in signal transduction, DNA remodelling, cytoskeletal organisation, membrane trafficking and spermatogenesis. This latter class includes the serine/threonine kinase <b>Center</b> <b>divider</b> (Cdi), which is homologous to the human LIM kinase, Testis specific kinase 1 (TESK 1), involved in cytoskeleton control through Cofilin phosphorylation. Eye-directed expression of cdi strongly suppressed the phenotypes induced by either RacGAP(84 C) gain-of-function or by the dominant negative form of Rac 1, Rac 1 N 17. These results are consistent with Cdi being a specific downstream target of Rac 1. We showed that Rac 1 and cdi are both expressed in Drosophila testis and that homozygous Rac 1 mutants exhibit poor fertility that is further reduced by introducing a cdi loss-of-function mutation in trans. Thus, results from a misexpression screen in the eye led us to a putative novel Rac 1 -Cdi-Cofilin pathway, regulated by RacGAP(84 C), coordinating Drosophila spermatogenesis...|$|E
40|$|How {{cellular}} {{behaviors such}} as cell-to-cell communication, epithelial organization and cell shape reorganization are coordinated during development is poorly understood. The developing Drosophila eye offers an ideal model system to study these processes. Localized actin polymerization is required to constrict the apical surface of epithelial cells of the eye imaginal disc to maintain the reﬁned arrangement of the developing ommatidia. The identity of each photoreceptor cell within the epithelium is determined by cell-to-cell contacts involving signal transduction events. The R 7 photoreceptor cell requires {{the activity of the}} Sevenless RTK to adopt a proper cell fate. We performed an EP screen for negative regulators of this inductive process, and we identiﬁed the serine/threonine kinase <b>Center</b> <b>divider</b> (cdi) as a suppressor of the phenotype caused by an activated Sevenless receptor. Cdi is homologous to the human testis-speciﬁc kinase 1 (TESK 1), a member of the LIM kinases involved in cytoskeleton control through ADF/coﬁlin phosphorylation. We have analyzed the effects of gain- and loss-of-function of cdi and found alterations in actin organization and in the adherens junctions proteins DE-cadherin and -catenin, as well as in Sevenless apical localization. Interference with the function of the ADF/coﬁlin phosphatase Slingshot (ssh), which antagonizes Cdi, also results in a suppression of signaling triggered by the Sevenless RTK. Our results reveal a critical interplay between the localization of molecules involved in epithelial organization and signal transduction. Key words: cdi, Sevenless, Photoreceptor, Eye, Acti...|$|E

High-dimensional Gaussian filters, most notably the bilateral filter, are important tools for many computer graphics and vision tasks. In recent years, a number of techniques for accelerating their evaluation have been developed by exploiting the separability of these Gaussians. However, these techniques do not apply to the more general class of spatially varying Gaussian filters, as they cannot be expressed as convolutions. These filters are useful because the underlying data—e. g. images, range data, meshes or light fields— often exhibit strong local anisotropy and scale. We propose an acceleration method for approximating spatially varying Gaussian filters using a set of spatially invariant Gaussian filters each of which is applied to a segment of some non-disjoint partitioning of the dataset. We then demonstrate that the resulting ability to locally tilt, rotate or scale the kernel improves filtering performance in various applications over traditional spatially invariant Gaussian filters, without incurring a significant penalty in computational expense...|$|E
