5|$|Initially overjoyed at the {{prospect}} of marrying, Marguerite Louise's ebullience faded to dismay when she discovered her half-sister, despite initially favouring the Tuscan match, then changed her mind. In reaction, Marguerite Louise's behaviour became erratic: she shocked the court by going out unaccompanied, a grievous offence in contemporary French society, with her cousin Prince Charles of Lorraine, who soon became her lover. Her marriage by proxy, on 19 April 1661, did nothing to change her attitude, much to the annoyance of Louis XIV's ministers. On the day she was supposed to meet diplomats offering their <b>congratulations</b> <b>on</b> the wedding, she attempted to abscond and go hunting, only to be stopped by the Duchess of Montpensier.|$|E

Returning to the front lines on 18 July, the battalion manned defensive positions in anticipation of a German attack. In August, it was tasked with carrying out a raid for prisoners and Baker took personal responsibility for reconnoitering the route and objective for the raid, which proved to be a success.

Instances of sickness and disease depleted the battalion, nevertheless when they were inspected by Blamey on 25 October he praised them for their performance and the 14th Brigade's commander, Colonel Ian Fullarton, sent the battalion's commanding officer his <b>congratulations</b> <b>on</b> having performed above expectations despite the circumstances in which they had been sent to New Guinea. Nevertheless, on 27 October 1942 it was announced that the battalion was to be amalgamated once again with the 53rd Battalion, which was being broken up as following its less than successful involvement in the fighting along the Kokoda Track. After they were linked once more, and the 55th/53rd Battalion went on to serve with success around Sanananda and then later in the Bougainville campaign in 1944–45.|$|E

500|$|There {{were times}} when Lady Rosebery's devotion to her husband was tested. Rosebery may have not been antisemitic before his {{marriage}}; however, the acerbic wit {{for which he was}} famous led him to make remarks that could have been taken in such a way, once his marriage had secured the Rothschild fortune. Rosebery seems to have disliked his first son, who he claimed looked [...] "Jewish." [...] On seeing his son {{for the first time he}} remarked [...] "Le Jew est fait, rien ne vas plus," [...] which must have been disconcerting for the child's very Jewish mother.

[...] Rosebery then left his newborn child and wife (who was again pregnant) for a year-long tour of Australia.

500|$|Problems arose during Tilley's {{administration}} {{because of}} conflicting Samoan and American laws. In one case, a native had caught and eaten a skipjack, a sacred fish which {{could only be}} eaten {{with the permission of}} a local chief under Samoan law. Traditional punishment decreed that the offender's house should be burned down and his crops uprooted, and he should be exiled from the territory. The native challenged his punishment under the American legal system, however, resulting in the arrest of the chief responsible for ordering the destruction of his property. The chief was sentenced to a year of house arrest in a criminal proceeding, on which Tilley sat as judge, and he was ordered to pay compensation for the destroyed property. There were similar issues with Samoan customs not blending well with the newly introduced American political divisions in the territory. For example, the territory's three district governors had equal authority but they were of differing Samoan social status. This disparity made decision-making more difficult and caused social tensions. Despite these problems, Tilley was well-considered by the locals. On December 18, 1900, the local chiefs sent a letter of <b>congratulations</b> <b>on</b> the re-election of President McKinley in which they said of Tilley, [...] "you gave us a leader, a Governor, a High Chief, whom we have learned to love and respect".|$|E
