The research looks at existing claims, analyses the claim data, and figures out the <b>claim</b> <b>patterns</b> using a variety of techniques within the methods of data mining. In the data analysis, it analysed trends and extracted insights from the claim data; what kind of a claim is driven by a certain set or combined set of factors such as the age of customer, what type of a claim that a customer tends to make. The analysis found that a BMC product (mobile phone) claim tends to be a customer who is younger than 35 years old and the claim tends to be made within 1 month of the policy being active. In the <b>claim</b> <b>pattern</b> analysis, the study used the Association Rule Mining with Apriori and R for finding patterns (rules) from the claim data.

40|$|PhD (Pharmacy Practice), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Pharmaceutical {{care can}} be defined as “the care that a given patient {{requires}} and receives which assures safe and rational drug usage” (Mikael et al., 1975 : 567). The supply of medication is an important link in the health care chain, and the supply of chronic medication specifically was reviewed in this study. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2008 d) states that chronic disease and related deaths are increasing in low- and middle-income countries, causing 39 % and 72 % of all deaths in low- and middle-income countries respectively. The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the difference between chronic medication prescribing patterns and subsequent <b>claiming</b> <b>patterns</b> for community (retail) and mail order (courier) pharmacies in the South African private health care sector. Computerized claims data for the period 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010 were extracted from the database of a South African pharmaceutical benefit management company. The chronic database consisted of 6 191 147 prescriptions (N = 17 706 524), 14 045 546 items (N = 42 176 768) at a total cost of R 2 126 516 154. 00 (N = R 4 969 436 580. 88). A quantitative, retrospective, cross-sectional drug utilisation review was conducted, and data were analysed using the Statistical Analysis System® programme. Various providers of chronic medication were analysed, namely dispensing doctors, dispensing specialists, courier pharmacies and retail pharmacies. Chronic medication represented 34. 97 % of all medication prescribed. Retail pharmacies dispensed 79 % of this chronic medication (n = 2 441 613 items) and courier pharmacies 19 % (n = 610 964 items). Courier pharmacies dispensed 1 147 687 prescriptions containing chronic medication and retail pharmacies dispensed 4 900 282. The average cost per prescription for chronic medication at retail pharmacies was R 325. 43 ± R 425. 74 (2009) and R 335. 10 ± R 449. 84 (2010), and that of courier pharmacies was R 398. 56 ± R 937. 61 in 2009 and R 436. 57 ± R 1199. 46 in 2010. The top-five chronic medication groups dispensed by both these pharmacy types were selected according to the number of unique patients utilising these medications for at least four consecutive months. The most utilised chronic medication groups were ACE inhibitors (n = 1 611 432), statins (n = 1 449 732), diuretics (n = 962 670), thyroid medication (n = 885 891) and oral antidiabetics (n = 696 631). The average medication possession ratio for retail pharmacies indicated that, on average, statins, diuretics, thyroid medication and oral antidiabetics were undersupplied by retail pharmacies. Courier pharmacies tended to oversupply more often than retail pharmacies, with the cost of oversupplied medication ranging from 9 % to 11 % of total courier pharmacy medication costs. The average chronic prescription, item and levy cost did not vary significantly between courier and retail pharmacies. This indicates that the relative cost of acquiring chronic medication is similar at retail and courier pharmacy. The medication possession ratios of the top-five chronic medication groups, however, did differ significantly. In order to choose the most appropriate provider, the medical scheme provider needs to consider the over- and undersupply of medication. Oversupply may lead to unnecessary costs whilst undersupply may lead to future noncompliance and associated health problems. The costs associated with undersupply of medication in the South African health care sector need further investigation. Doctora...|$|E

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Department of Human Services’ management of Medicare compliance audits. Audit objective, criteria and scope The objective of the audit was to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} Department of Human Services’ management of Medicare compliance audits. To form an opinion against the audit objective, the ANAO examined the design and operation of departmental processes against the following high‑level criteria: 	Human Services effectively identifies, selects and prioritises potential cases of non‑compliance for compliance audits. 	Compliance audits are conducted in accordance with legislative and operational requirements. 	Non‑compliance actions are managed and the information is used to inform future compliance activities. The ANAO interviewed Human Services staff involved in the conduct of Medicare compliance audits and key stakeholders, and reviewed key guidance materials and documents, including departmental reports that capture Medicare compliance performance information. The ANAO also reviewed a sample of Medicare compliance audits. Overall conclusion Medicare is a long‑standing publicly funded program which aims to make affordable health care accessible for Australians and other eligible persons. The integrity and sustainability of the Medicare program, which features a high volume of transactions, is supported by Human Services’ ongoing monitoring of claims by health professionals against the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and a program of compliance activities, including audits of billing by health professionals. The 2008 – 09 Budget measure—Increased Medicare Compliance Audits initiative (IMCA initiative) —provided Human Services with enhanced legislative powers and substantial additional funding to support an expanded program of Medicare compliance audits. Overall, the effectiveness of Human Services’ management of Medicare compliance audits has been mixed. Human Services has delivered a program of compliance audits and related compliance activities, which has helped reinforce health professionals’ awareness of their compliance obligations. However, the department’s administration of Medicare compliance audits and its implementation of the Budget measure, the IMCA initiative, demonstrated a range of shortcomings that detracted from the department’s performance in delivering these elements of its broader Compliance Program. Human Services largely determines its program of Medicare compliance audits in response to compliance risks identified through a mix of environmental scans (such as monitoring MBS <b>claiming</b> <b>patterns),</b> tip‑offs and stakeholder input. The ANAO’s review of a targeted sample of Medicare compliance audits indicated that for the most part, key compliance audit processes were followed, and audit outcomes, such as the number of health professionals assessed as non‑compliant and the total amount of debts raised, are appropriately documented. The department has also captured operational lessons learned and identified recommendations for action that have the potential to contribute to the conduct and improvement of future compliance activities. However, there remain a number of areas where Human Services can improve its administration of Medicare compliance audits, to the benefit of the broader Compliance Program. While the department has processes in place to identify risks to the Medicare program, historically it has not routinely undertaken preliminary analysis of emerging risks in a timely way. Consequently, a large number of identified risks have not been substantively analysed to determine whether their treatment should be given priority and factored into Human Services’ compliance planning. The department has very recently taken some steps to consider such a process. The ANAO’s review of a sample of Medicare compliance audits also identified inconsistent approaches within Human Services to calculating debts, with variability in the standards of proof accepted by different compliance officers in calculating debts. There would be merit in Human Services finalising and implementing a debt calculation policy, to address inconsistencies and strengthen the department’s overall management of non‑compliance. Since 2008 – 09, the department has administered an expanded program of Medicare compliance audits funded through the IMCA initiative. The initiative, which was a measure funded by the Budget, provided $ 76. 9  million to Human Services to conduct an additional 8000 Medicare compliance audits over four years and return an estimated $ 147. 2  million in savings, thus anticipating net savings of $ 70. 3  million. However, between 2008 – 09 and 2012 – 13, Human Services only raised a total of $ 49. 2  million in debts and recovered $ 18. 9  million from Medicare compliance audits. The available Human Services’ data shows that there was a $ 128. 3  million shortfall in the savings achieved by the department, in the form of monies actually recovered, against the target set by the budget initiative—some 87  per cent less than the $ 147. 2  million in expected savings. From the performance information available, the ANAO’s analysis indicates that since the introduction of the budget measure, the compliance audits performed by the department, including those performed under the department’s enhanced legislative powers, were delivered at a net cost to government. The responsible Minister (the then Minister for Human Services) and the policy Minister (the then Minister for Health and Ageing) had been asked by the Expenditure Review Committee (ERC) of Cabinet in 2008 to report back to government on achievements against the IMCA Budget measure in 2011 – 12. In this context, Human Services did not develop or implement its proposal to monitor and report on savings to support this reporting requirement; an opportunity missed, given ministerial expectations of a significant return on the government’s investment. As mentioned above, the IMCA initiative funded Human Services to deliver a substantially increased audit program. The department only met its key performance indicator— 2500 completed Medicare audit and review cases per year—once in 2011 – 12, when it reported completing 2549 Medicare audits and reviews. While the annual target had been agreed by Ministers in the 2008 – 09 Budget context, during 2012 – 13 Human Services altered the mix of compliance activities it counted towards the target, by including 500 less onerous ‘targeted feedback letters’, as well as compliance activities directed towards members of the public rather than health professionals. The department subsequently reported completing a total of 2819 Medicare compliance cases in 2012 – 13, against the revised activity mix. If the additional compliance activities were excluded, the number of Medicare compliance audits and reviews completed in 2012 – 13 (against the Ministerially agreed target) was 2073. While acknowledging the department’s advice that targeted feedback letters were a valid compliance treatment intended to encourage voluntary compliance, their inclusion resulted in inaccurate performance reporting for the budget measure, as well as inaccurate and inflated internal reporting of its compliance coverage rate. There would have been merit in Human Services informing their Minister of the proposal to change the compliance activities to be conducted and reported against publicly. The audit highlights the need for agencies to meet government expectations and effectively monitor and report on the delivery of intended outcomes, including the realisation of expected savings. The department’s failure to implement its proposed monitoring and reporting arrangements for the IMCA initiative restricted its capacity to demonstrate whether it had delivered the expected return on the Government’s significant investment in an expanded program of Medicare compliance audits. The ANAO has made two recommendations to strengthen Human Services’ management of its Compliance Program for Medicare. The recommendations focus on strengthening the department’s assessment of Medicare compliance risks and its capacity to effectively target resources by better capturing and reporting on the benefits realised from Medicare compliance audits, {{in the context of the}} broader Compliance Program...|$|E

40|$|Warranty {{claims are}} not always due to product failures. They can also be caused by two types of human factors.

In this paper, we propose three models to estimate the expected warranty cost when the two types of human factors are included.

The commercial viability (in terms of post-tax earnings) of such an insurance programme, as targeted at the low-income households, is investigated, {{with a focus on}} the so-called gap market in the country’s housing market ladder. One highlight of the study is the difficulty of determining an appropriate price for the premium, given no prior historical record of default behaviour in the target market. This leads to a less than ideal resort to a <b>claims</b> <b>pattern</b> (and earnings pattern) from a mature and yet arguably different market in Canada. These so-called international patterns of default behaviour, although perhaps not representative of the local South African situation, have been used in successful first-time MI implementation elsewhere in emerging economies. The study finds in favour of a profitable, sustainable programme under assumed economic conditions of relatively high mortgage interest rates of 13 % pa and higher. Premium under-pricing, however, appears to occur at mortgage rates of 10 % pa and lower, rendering the business unworkable over a 9 -year forecast period, with persistent annual reported negative earnings for the period.

Mr. Grove leads Tillinghast's claims consulting practice, assisting property/casualty executives with the analysis, implementation, and improvement of claims strategies, policies, and practices. Casualty actuaries have long recognized that changes in <b>claims</b> <b>patterns</b> can create distortions in loss projections and loss reserve estimates. Various actuarial methods are used to detect, mitigate and adjust for (or avoid) these distortions. The actuarial literature provides considerable guidance and numerous techniques in this regard, and this paper does not re-cover this ground. This paper describes and illustrates important benefits of regular and ongoing interaction between casualty actuaries and Claim Department personnel, and emphasizes that this is a two-way street. Qualitative and quantitative input from the Claim Department can be critical in helping the actuary understand, appropriately interpret, and even anticipate changes that affect the actuarial data and actuarial projections. The actuary's work, in turn, can serve as an effective diagnostic to identify potential macroscopic changes in the claims arena [...] including mix changes, reporting <b>patterns,</b> <b>claim</b> management issues, case reserving changes, and closure/settlement patterns. With these diagnostics in hand, the actuary {{plays a key role in}} the early identification, communication, analysis and resolution of unwanted, unintended, or unrecognized claim changes that may have important business consequences extending well beyond the Actuarial Department. The message here is that the actuary must be an active [...] and interactive [...] part of the management team. Input from the Claims Department is arguably a necessary ingredient to the actuary's work. But when the actuary provides insight to the Claims Department, the actuary can add value to the entire organization. ...|$|R
5000|$|Losada {{developed}} a nonlinear dynamics model, the meta learning model, to show dynamical patterns achieved by high, medium and low performing teams, where performance was evaluated based on profitability, customer satisfaction, and 360-degree feedback. Losada <b>claimed</b> these <b>patterns</b> {{appear in a}} space of [...] "positivity-negativity," [...] "inquiry-advocacy" [...] and [...] "other-self," [...] and are controlled by connectivity, {{which is supposed to}} reflect interpersonal attunement of a team. [...] This work has been strongly criticised for flawed methodology and as an invalid application of Lorenz equations by Brown et al. and by Andrés Navas.|$|R
40|$|Modelling sets up Markov {{models that}} can be used as {{underlying}} framework for the incorporation of, say, no‐claims discounts into premium considerations. This project picks up these threads and considers how past claims experience can be used to set and update premium levels as time evolves. The focus in on an individual policy in a portfolio. While the policies in the portfolio may offer the same benefits in principle, the policy holders will display a variety of <b>claims</b> <b>patterns.</b> We can model this by a family of claims distributions Fθ depending on a parameter θ. The idea is that each policy holder generates claims X 1, [...] .,Xn according to Fθ for some θ, which is unknown and can be estimated from X 1, [...] .,Xn. Part II of Mikosch’s book describes a Bayesian approach due to Bühlmann which considers θ, varying across the population, to be randomly sampled from the population (independently for each policy holder). Using a prior distribution for θ that reflects the whole population, which is a fair choice {{in the absence of any}} further information, claims X 1, [...] .,Xn allow to update our belief of the parameter θ and calculate a posterior distribution. There is some general theory, there are some parametric models, and further developments exist under various simplifying assumptions. The proposal is to work these out in this dissertation, beginnin...|$|R
