5|$|On July 21, 1961, Grissom was {{pilot of}} the second Project Mercury flight, Mercury-Redstone 4, which he named Liberty Bell 7. This was a sub-orbital flight that lasted 15 minutes and 37 seconds. After splashdown, {{emergency}} explosive bolts unexpectedly fired and blew the hatch off, causing water to flood into the spacecraft. Quickly exiting through the open hatch and into the ocean, Grissom nearly drowned as water began filling his spacesuit. A recovery helicopter tried to lift and retrieve the spacecraft, but the flooding spacecraft became too heavy, and it was ultimately <b>cut</b> <b>loose</b> before sinking.|$|E

5|$|Bedser was {{relieved}} after 70 minutes of bowling. The leg spin of Wright was introduced and Australia <b>cut</b> <b>loose.</b> Wright bowled a no ball that Morris dispatched into the leg side crowd for six, before hitting another ball for four. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. Coxon continued to significantly rough up the pitch outside the right-handed batsman's leg stump, {{and from the}} other, Wright was able to extract substantial spin on the first morning of the match, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump. At lunch, Australia were 82/1 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. The tourists had largely been content to wait for loose deliveries, rather than take risks, and as the Englishmen bowled accurately, the Australians did not score quickly.|$|E
5|$|In the Second Test at Lord's, Australia {{elected to}} bat first and England made an ideal start. The debutant Alec Coxon opened the bowling and removed Barnes for a duck {{in his second}} over to leave the {{tourists}} at 1/3. England restricted the Australians in the first hour and created several near misses, particularly against Bradman, who nervous early on. In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scored many runs from the back cut. At {{the end of the}} pace bowlers' opening spells, the leg spin of Doug Wright was introduced and Australia <b>cut</b> <b>loose.</b> Wright bowled a no ball that Morris dispatched over the leg side fence for six, before hitting another ball for four. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated steadily, although the latter was able to extract substantial spin, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump. At lunch, Australia were 1/82 with Morris on 45 and Bradman on 35.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 12 May, U-6 headed out to try to {{intercept}} shipping between Santa Maria di Leuca and Valona. Linienschiffsleutnant Hugo von Falkhausen, U-6s commander since November 1915, attempted to pass underneath two drifters that formed {{a part of the}} Otranto Barrage. While submerged, von Falkhausen heard an unexplained noise on the hull of the boat, which was likely the sound of U-6 fouling one of the anti-submarine nets deployed from the drifter Calistoga. The drifter's skipper was alerted to the submarine's presence when one of the indicator buoys had fired. Calistoga launched signal flares that attracted the attention of two nearby drifters Dulcie Doris and Evening Star II. In the meantime, von Falkhausen surfaced U-6 to try to <b>cut</b> <b>loose</b> the buoy being dragged behind his boat. When the hatch was opened, the crew discovered the boat entangled in the net.|$|E

25|$|Gloucestershire's batting, however, gave below-average scores. Their first innings {{lasted for}} 35 overs, Mark Ealham taking five for 31 as the {{visitors}} {{were asked to}} follow on.

He hit eight fours and three sixes for a 27-ball 55, before the cameo was ended by Hussey holding a catch off his bat. The quickfire innings lifted Gloucestershire to 169 - still 64 short of making Nottinghamshire bat again.|$|E

25|$|Grant faced two Confederate armies in his campaign: the Vicksburg garrison, {{commanded}} by Maj. Gen. John C. Pemberton, and forces in Jackson, {{commanded by}} Gen. Joseph E.

Rather than simply heading directly {{north to the}} city, Grant chose to cut the line of communications (and reinforcement) between the two Confederate armies. His army headed swiftly northeast toward Jackson. Meanwhile, Grant brought with him a limited supply line. The conventional history of the campaign indicates that he <b>cut</b> <b>loose</b> from all of his supplies, perplexing Pemberton, who attempted to interdict his nonexistent lines at Raymond on May 12.

25|$|If Hanno somehow {{had won the}} battle, {{it might}} have been {{possible}} for Hannibal to get reinforcements from Barcid Iberia as early as 217 BC. This battle brought the same results for Scipio in Iberia as the Battle of Trebia would bring for Hannibal in Italy: securing a base of operation, and winning over some of the native tribes as a source of provisions and recruits, also cutting off the overland communication of Hannibal from his base in Iberia. Unlike Hannibal, Scipio did not immediately launch a major campaign on enemy territory south of the river. Nor would he <b>cut</b> <b>loose</b> from his base like Hannibal did in the near future. Scipio took time to consolidate his holdings, subjugate or befriend Iberian tribes and raid Carthaginian territory. These activities laid the foundation for the future Roman operations in Iberia.|$|E

He <b>cut</b> <b>loose</b> in the occasional run chase, hitting five sixes off Jim McConnon at Swansea in the 1958 season and five more at Lord's in the 1961 season.

25|$|However, {{a tougher}} fight awaited against Surrey at The Oval, who had England's Test spin {{combination}} of Jim Laker and Tony Lock. Miller {{came in at}} 3/124 to join Colin McDonald and struggled, scoring 18runs in his first 120minutes; it was the slowest two hours of scoring in his career, featuring much pad play as he attempted to play Laker from the crease, and stretching forward with his long arms when necessary. Such was Miller's watchfulness that he only scored 21 of 97 runs as Australia lost 6/97 to be 9/217, whereas he was normally an attacking batsman. As his partners continued to fall, Miller accelerated and scored 36 of the 42runs in the last-wicket partnership with Jack Wilson in half an hour. He <b>cut</b> <b>loose</b> in two consecutive overs from Lock, taking 11 and 14 respectively. He ended unbeaten on 57 as Australia were bowled out for 259; Laker taking all ten wickets. Surrey then scored 347. Miller fell to Lock for two in the second innings as Australia collapsed as lost 9/34 for 107. Such was the spin-friendly nature of the surface that Surrey's new ball pairing bowled only three overs before Laker and Lock took over. During the match, the home team's spin pairing bowled more than 65% of the overs, something {{that was to be}} repeated throughout the summer. Surrey then compiled the 20 runs required for victory, inflicting a ten-wicket defeat, Australia's first loss to a county since 1912. Following the loss, sections of the Australian media, led by Jack Fingleton, began campaigning for Miller to replace Johnson as captain.|$|E
