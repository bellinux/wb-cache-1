5000|$|The {{energy release}} {{component}} (ERC) {{is a number}} related to the available energy (BTU) per unit area (square foot) within the flaming front {{at the head of}} a fire. Daily variations in ERC are due to changes in moisture content of the various fuels present, both live and dead. Since this number represents the potential [...] "heat release" [...] per unit area in the flaming zone, it can provide guidance to several important fire activities. It may also be considered a <b>composite</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture value as it reflects the contribution that all live and dead fuels have to potential fire intensity.

Due to low pollutant emission and superior combustion characteristics hydrogen/hydrocarbon blends have received increased attention as alternative fuels for numerous power generation applications. The combustion chemistry of hydrocarbon fuels is significantly {{different from that of}} hydrogen and the flame structure of <b>composite</b> <b>fuels</b> largely depends on the interaction between the two mechanisms.

Hydrogen was added up to 50 % in volume. Temperature axial profiles of different flames were measured by a radiation corrected thermocouple. A cw Nd:YAG laser was used to measure soot axial profiles. The results indicate that hydrogen has a great influence in reducing the amount of soot in the investigated region of the flame. In order to distinguish between chemical and pure dilution effects, similar flames were also produced by helium addition. Soot reduction has been also observed in this case but to a minor extent.

This project builds on the team's commercial experience in <b>composite</b> <b>fuels</b> for energy production. The electric utility industry is interested in the use of biomass and wastes as fuel to reduce both emissions and fuel costs. In addition to these benefits, utilities also recognize the business advantage of consuming the waste byproducts of customers both to retain customers and to improve the public image of the industry. Unfortunately, biomass and waste byproducts can be troublesome fuels because of low bulk density, high moisture content, variable composition, handling and feeding problems, and inadequate information about combustion and emissions characteristics. Current methods of co-firing biomass and wastes either use a separate fuel receiving, storage, and boiler feed system, or mass burn the biomass by simply mixing it with coal on the storage pile. For biomass or biomass-containing <b>composite</b> <b>fuels</b> to be extensively used in the U.
