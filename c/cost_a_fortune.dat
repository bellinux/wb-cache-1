500|$|In 2012, it was {{revealed}} that she had paid for the medical tests for a man called Julian Jean DeBaptiste in Saint Lucia in 2009. [...] "I had surgery on 1 July 2009... it <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune</b> and Amy paid for the whole thing. I tried to thank her but she just hugged me and told me not to say anything. Her generosity gave me my life back." ...|$|E
500|$|There was {{debate about}} {{the merits of the}} producer's {{decision}} to avoid depicting the two battles between the Starks and Lannisters. Ryan criticized it and confessed being [...] "a little disappointed that many of the major characters are caught up in a war and we're not seeing it." [...] Sims regretted not seeing the fight, and although he claimed to understand the budget constrictions, he felt that [...] "all this off-screen fighting is just getting my blood rushing for some on-screen fighting." [...] Sepinwall concludes: [...] "Ideally, we'd get a few epic, Braveheart-level battle scenes at some point, but I also respect the demands of time and budget here. Those kinds of sequences <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune,</b> and they eat up a lot of screen time, and I think ultimately I'd have rather had the time, say, that we spent in Tyrion's tent the night before the battle, with the mortifying story of his ex-wife, and then whatever it cost to make the execution sequence look as good as it did, than for the episode to have given us one or two long fight scenes." ...|$|E

50|$|NUST offers {{very limited}} {{accommodation}} for students. As a result, most students rely on accommodation as tenants {{in the nearby}} suburbs. The accommodation is readily available, but sometimes it <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune</b> {{to stay close to}} the campus.|$|R

2500|$|EastEnders {{programme}} makers {{took the}} decision that the show was to be about [...] "everyday life" [...] {{in the inner city}} [...] "today" [...] and regarded it as a [...] "slice of life". Creator/producer Julia Smith declared that [...] "We don't make life, we reflect it". She also said, [...] "We decided to go for a realistic, fairly outspoken type of drama which could encompass stories about homosexuality, rape, unemployment, racial prejudice, etc., in a believable context. Above all, we wanted realism". In 2011, the head of BBC drama, John Yorke, said that the real East End had changed significantly since EastEnders started, and the show no longer truly reflected real life, but that it had an [...] "emotional truthfulness" [...] and was partly [...] "true to the original vision" [...] and partly [...] "adapt to a changing world", adding that [...] "If it was a show where every house <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune</b> and everyone drove a Lexus, it wouldn't be EastEnders. You have to show shades of that change, but certain things are immutable, I would argue, like The Vic and the market." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Land sakes alive, be you Mr. Flint's daughter? I {{might have}} knowed {{it from the}} lace--that dress must have <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune.</b> But I didn't think to find you so common." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't! I shall send to Paris {{to match}} it, and then wear a braid round {{my head as}} you do sometimes. I suppose it will <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune,</b> but I won't have a strong-minded crop. A friend of mine got a lovely golden switch for fifty dollars." ...|$|E
50|$|By mid-2008 the Village Hall {{had reached}} a sorry, {{dilapidated}} state both inside and out. Inside it was cold, damp and <b>an</b> environmental nightmare <b>costing</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune</b> to run. In 2009 the hall was closed for 2 months to carry out energy efficiency improvements and to extensively repair and enhance the building and site. The hall was reopened in September 2009 after repairs and improvements totalling nearly £60,000.|$|R
50|$|After a heavy downpour , soil, gravel, silt and {{valuable}} nutrients are lost when the rains wash away the top soil. This animation of a side {{view of a}} mountain embankment shows how bad soil management contributes to tonnes of topsoil ending up in flood areas and river beds. It <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune</b> to collect the soil from river beds, estuaries and river mouths, decontaminate, transport and physically replace the reclaimed sand.|$|R
30|$|Charley: Things are hot at {{the minute}} there’s a month long {{internal}} investigation {{going on at}} royal mail, {{they are looking for}} drugs so we can’t send anything out. It’s <b>cost</b> me <b>a</b> <b>fortune.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And," [...] {{said one}} of the men who stood behind, [...] "we may be dead by then. How're we going to worry through when the snow comes and it's going to <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune</b> to get {{provisions}} in when the Crown takes the big share of what most of us make?" ...|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding {{the present}} magnificence of the court, royalty is shorn {{of much of}} its splendour in France, {{since the days of}} Louis XVI. Then a city of a hundred {{thousand}} souls (Versailles) was a mere dependant of the crown; lodgings for many hundred abbés, it is said, were provided in the palace alone, and a simple representation at the palace opera <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Dandy Dale's outfit," [...] he said, with animation. [...] "Dandy was {{a would-be}} {{knight of the}} road. He dressed the part. But he tried to hold up a stage over here and an unappreciative {{passenger}} shot him. He wasn't killed outright. He crawled away and died. Some of my men found him and they fetched his clothes. That outfit <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune.</b> But not a man among us could get into it." ...|$|E
50|$|Hofmann {{was married}} and {{divorced}} twice, the second time to singer Deborah Sasson from 1983 to 1990. His divorces <b>cost</b> him <b>a</b> <b>fortune,</b> and he lived {{the last years of}} his life in relative poverty.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have left}} orders," [...] Miss Marlett answered, [...] "that only telegrams of instant {{importance}} {{are to be}} sent on at once. It costs twelve shillings, and parents and people are so tiresome, always telegraphing about nothing in particular, and <b>costing</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune.</b> These telegrams were very important, of course; but nothing more {{could have been done}} about them if they had arrived last night, than if they came this morning. I have {{had a great deal of}} annoyance and expense," [...] the schoolmistress added, [...] "with telegrams that had to be paid for." ...|$|R
50|$|During the metamorphosis, Kim {{reveals that}} she has a secret {{compartment}} in her body, containing a fairly large gel-crystal — one that is usually used in a supercomputer. The crystal <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune,</b> and the fact that a poor, hungry girl is carrying it around makes no sense at all. With Alex's help, Kim successfully goes through the metamorphosis overnight and is completely fine in the morning. She refuses to talk about herself or of how she got to the planet. She only confirms that she does not know anyone on the planet and has no job or identification.|$|R
60|$|SAVOYARD. Yes: {{thats what}} {{staggered}} me. It was {{easy enough to}} engage a company for a private performance: it's done often enough. But the notion of having critics was new. I hardly knew how to set about it. They dont expect private engagements; and so they have no agents. Besides, I didnt know what to offer them. I {{knew that they were}} cheaper than actors, because they get long engagements: forty years sometimes; but thats no rule for a single job. Then theres such a lot of them: on first nights they run away with all your stalls: you cant find a decent place for your own mother. It would have <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune</b> to bring the lot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. It flopped on {{the road}} and died there. Never got to New York at all. Ike Schumann wouldn't let Fillmore have a theatre. The book wanted fixing and the numbers wanted fixing and the scenery wasn't right: and while they were {{tinkering}} with all that there was trouble about the cast and the Actors Equity closed the show. Best thing that could have happened, really, and I was glad at the time, because going on with it would only have meant wasting more money, and it had <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune</b> already. After that Fillmore put on a play of Gerald Foster's and that was a frost, too. It ran a week at the Booth. I hear the new piece he's got in rehearsal now is no good either. It's called 'The Wild Rose,' or something. But Fillmore's {{got nothing to do with}} that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, he has {{not been}} here; but he told me that if he ever got into a duel he would aim at his opponent's hand, and he has been practising {{specially}} for that. He had a target made on purpose, but that did not please him, and we rigged out an arm holding a pistol and fixed it to the target just in the position it would be if the painted figure were firing at him. We had to have a rough sort of hand made of iron, for it would have <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune</b> if had been made of anything else. Sometimes he would have it painted white, sometimes gray, sometimes black, either of which it might be, if a man wore gloves, but it did not make any difference to him; and I have seen him hit it twenty times following, over and over again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So was I. But she couldn't have. It {{certainly}} isn't here. I {{have heard}} that the white plume on it <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> small <b>fortune.</b> Here is her black silk mantle. It seems like sacrilege to meddle with these clothes." ...|$|R
5000|$|Louis Rivett-Carnac, of Great Yarmouth {{coastguard}} said [...] "A lifeboat went {{to offer}} him assistance and persuade {{him that it was}} crazy and he was <b>costing</b> us <b>a</b> <b>fortune</b> so he decided to knock it on the head"He was towed ashore to Cromer beach.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{sort of man}} you describe," [...] said he, [...] "would <b>cost</b> you <b>a</b> <b>fortune,</b> for {{you would}} oblige him to abandon a large and lucrative {{practice}} in order to accompany you. I doubt, indeed, if any price would tempt him to abandon his patients." ...|$|R
60|$|Echoes, sir. His first {{purchase}} was an echo in Georgia that repeated four times; his next was a six-repeater in Maryland; his next was a thirteen-repeater in Maine; his next was a nine-repeater in Kansas; his next was a twelve-repeater in Tennessee, which he got cheap, so to speak, {{because it was}} out of repair, a portion of the crag which reflected it having tumbled down. He believed he could repair it at a cost of a few thousand dollars, and, by increasing the elevation with masonry, treble the repeating capacity; but the architect who undertook the job had never built an echo before, and so he utterly spoiled this one. Before he meddled with it, it used to talk back like a mother-in-law, but now it was only fit for the deaf-and-dumb asylum. Well, next he bought a lot of cheap little double-barreled echoes, scattered around over various states and territories; he got them at twenty per cent. off by taking the lot. Next he bought a perfect Gatling-gun of an echo in Oregon, and it <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune,</b> I can tell you. You may know, sir, that in the echo market the scale of prices is cumulative, like the carat-scale in diamonds; in fact, the same phraseology is used. A single-carat echo is worth but ten dollars over and above the value of the land it is on; a two-carat or double-barreled echo is worth thirty dollars; a five-carat is worth nine hundred and fifty; a ten-carat is worth thirteen thousand. My uncle's Oregon-echo, which he called the Great Pitt Echo, was a twenty-two carat gem, and cost two hundred and sixteen thousand dollars--they threw the land in, for it was four hundred miles from a settlement.|$|E

5000|$|... "It is {{impossible}} to praise this film too highly", wrote The Moving Picture World magazine. [...] "It reproduces the story as closely as {{it is possible to}} do in a film and the technical excellence of the work cannot be questioned. The photography, the staging and the acting are all of the best, and the story told is always impressive. … Such films cannot be too highly commended. They are a welcome relief from the riot of bloodshed which has marred the moving picture shows of New York and other cities far too long. Even though it <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune</b> almost to prepare such a film, it is quite likely that the public will patronize it sufficiently to make good the extraordinary outlay." ...|$|R
5000|$|Since their rather inauspicious {{invitation}} for further study, {{the effort to}} understand and restore ciénagas has gradually gained prominence. Although not the exclusive view, but suggestive of how ciénagas were typically thought of historically, is this exchange, a 1940s-era conversation between Richard Bradford's narrator, Joshua Arnold, and his school chum in the New Mexico novel, Red Sky at Morning"I didn't know there was this much water around Sagrado," [...] I said. [...] "The Sagrado River's been dry since I got here.""This is a cienega," [...] Parker said. [...] "It's some kind of underground spring, but it’s not good for anything but making the ground wet. <b>Costs</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune</b> to drain it or pump it off, and Cloyd isn't about to spend money for things like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "John shall {{go after}} that man to-morrow, {{and bring him}} back to carry this terrible monkey away. I can't live with him a week; he will <b>cost</b> me <b>a</b> <b>fortune,</b> and wear us all out," [...] said Aunt Jane, when Jocko was safely shut up in the cellar, after six boys had chased him all over the {{neighborhood}} before they caught him.|$|R
50|$|On 2 May 2008, {{again the}} cathedral glasses were {{strongly}} hit and {{damaged by the}} Nargis cyclone.

5000|$|For instance, {{he found}} [...] "hundreds of old pub mirrors labels, {{completely}} clean and unused" [...] with {{every one of}} them [...] "for a certain period of time". He said [...] "to reproduce these would have <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune</b> but we can now label any product - can or bottle - with a real label so it won't be a reproduction at all." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Daddy," [...] she said, impressively, [...] "it {{must have}} <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> big <b>fortune</b> to furnish these little rooms.

500|$|I {{always loved}} going to Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there {{looked like a}} {{building}} anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I wondered {{if it would be}} possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it takes a long time to make and <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> <b>fortune.</b> But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like the one I had in mind... —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|R
