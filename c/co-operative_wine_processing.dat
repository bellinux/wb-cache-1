40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this article is to {{introduce}} what is traditionally known in France as the wine filière. The paper is divided into two parts. First, we will introduce the theoretical approaches and the main research questions relating to the ‘filière analysis', by combining older references with the complementary approaches derived from more recent theoretical contributions. The filière analysis is based on three main historical theoretical streams and on four complementary and more recent approaches: the innovation chains, the global value chain (GVC), the theory of transaction costs and the marketing approach. In the second part of the paper, we will provide a general overview of the wine filière and conduct an analysis of the main actors, grape growers, <b>co-operatives,</b> <b>wine</b> brokers, wine merchants and clusters according to the research questions introduced previously...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} the {{processed}} product and the strategies on the final market strongly depends on the types of vertical relationship among the supply chain participants, on the types of economic agents (vine growers, wineries, bottlers), on their structural and organizational characteristics. We provide an original study of the <b>wine</b> <b>processing</b> sector by {{taking into account the}} role of the supply chain organization in determining the {{quality of the}} processed product. Indeed, the objective {{of this paper is to}} study the relationship between structural and organizational characteristics of the Italian <b>wine</b> <b>processing</b> sector and the incidence of quality wine production. Furthermore, we provide a regional description of <b>wine</b> <b>processing</b> units in terms of quality, plants’ size, type of vertical relationship and final product’s valorisation on the final market (through bottling specialization and localisation indexes). This analysis is based on the treatment and elaborations of data concerning harvest and production declarations (source: agea) and wine bottling stage (source: Infocamere - Unioncamere). Wineries are classified according to the degree of vertical integration between the vine-growing and the <b>wine</b> <b>processing</b> stage in agricultural wineries, industrial wineries and cooperatives. At national level, we show that agricultural wineries are mainly characterized by low quantity but high quality wine production, while industrial wineries are mediumbig size firms mainly oriented to table wine production. The regional analysis makes it possible to identify and describe some "structural and organizational typologies" that may characterize specific regional areas. We first point out a positive relationship between the incidence of quality wine production and the quantity of wine processed by (1) small-medium plants’ size wineries and (2) vertically integrated wineries. Moreover, we show that a strong regional orientation to quality wine production may coexist with a high level of specialization in bottling activities that facilitate the strategies for the development of brands on the final market (both of locally produced wine and of wine produced outside the region). ...|$|R

Before {{being used in the}} clinics, C. yanhusuo is traditionally processed through dry-frying or frying with vinegar, wine or salt. In this study, eleven alkaloids from Corydalis Rhizoma, namely protopine (1), ⍺-allocryptopine (2), tetrahydrocolumbamine (3), coptisine (4), palmatine (5), berberine (6), dehydrocorydaline (7), d,l-tetrahydropalmatine (8), tetrahydroberberine (9), corydaline (10) and tetrahydrocoptisine (11) were simultaneously quantified using a newly developed high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) method. The influence of vinegar and <b>wine</b> <b>processing</b> on the content of the main alkaloids of Corydalis Rhizoma was investigated.

In the two water decoctions, <b>wine</b> and vinegar <b>processing</b> increased the amount of tertiary alkaloids.

40|$|Vinegar and <b>wine</b> <b>processing</b> of {{medicinal}} plants are two traditional pharmaceutical techniques {{which have been}} used for thousands of years in China. Tetrahydropalmatine (THP), dehydrocorydaline (DHC) and protopine are three major bioactive molecules in Rhizoma Corydalis. In this study, a simple and reliable HPLC method was developed for simultaneous analysis of THP, DHC and protopine in rat tissues after gastric gavage administration of Rhizoma Corydalis. The validated HPLC method was successfully applied to investigate the effect of <b>wine</b> and vinegar <b>processing</b> on the compounds’ distribution in rat tissues. Our results showed that processing mainly affect the Tmax and mean residence time (MRT) of the molecules without changing their Cmax and AUC 0 – 24 h Vinegar processing significantly increased the Tmax of DHC in heart, kidney, cerebrum, cerebrellum, brain stem and striatum and prolonged the Tmax of protopine in brain. No significant changes were observed on the Tmax of THP in rat tissues after vinegar <b>processing.</b> <b>Wine</b> <b>processing</b> reduced the Tmax of protopine and DHC in liver and spleen and Tmax of protopine in lung, but increased the Tmax of THP in all the rat tissues examined.

The success of strategy is often determined by a leader’s ability to translate sophisticated strategic intent into simple, actionable language and to cascade this to every level in the organization to ensure alignment. To determine {{the success of the}} communication and level of alignment between the various hierarchical levels with regard to vision, mission and strategic objectives, concept maps were used. Five case studies are presented where a computer-based concept-mapping tool, CmapTools, was applied for the visual representation and measurement of strategic alignment amongst three hierarchical levels (CEO, Executive team and Employees) of <b>co-operative</b> <b>wine</b> cellars in the Paarl district of South Africa. The results of the empirical research clearly indicated a serious misalignment of strategic intent amongst all hierarchical levels and amongst each section of strategic intent.

To study the processes of <b>wine</b> <b>processing</b> by the proposed method it was made an experimental installation on the basis of pilot machine MRp- 1 / 2 for bottling of quiet liquids and an ultrasonic device "Volna– M" UZTA- 1 / 22 -OM with a firmly, waveguide which transmits sound, fixed filter frame on the ultrasound emitter. To stabilize the performance of ultrasonic units with ceramic membrane elements without quality deterioration of wines it was empirically determined rational parameters of power of ultrasound input and pressure in the system. The given derived dependencies and graphs allow to define the time of relatively stable operating filter regime. It was revealed a significant cost reduction on filtration, as it allows escape from the contamination of the product by various preservatives, and increasing of storage duration in a sealed container during aseptic filling without a thermal sterilization. Ultrasonic emitter contact by superposition wave vibrations on the ceramic filter increases not only the efficiency of gas removal, but also improves the organoleptic characteristics, stabilizes the filters, improves their productivity. Gas removal creates unfavorable conditions for development of the yeast, which in turn increases the shelf life of semisweet wine...|$|R
