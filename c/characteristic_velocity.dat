5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a laminar boundary layer. This results in a lower skin friction due to the <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocity</b> profile of laminar flow. However, the boundary layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as boundary layer transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck the boundary layer away through a porous surface (see Boundary layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow techniques push the boundary layer transition aft by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E

40|$|A {{theory of}} the {{coupling}} of N systems of Navier-Stokes equations is presented. A set of coupled Navier-Stokes systems contains the macroscopic equations of motion for flows ofN different material components or phases. Six postulates are formulated from which three Navier-Stokes sets are derived for arbitrary N. The main postulate concerns the second law of thermodynamics, which the present sets satisfy for arbitrary N. Appropriate averages of velocities and pressures distribute the entropy production of each irreversible interaction process among the interacting components. Increase of entropy is guaranteed if the interaction terms are suitably constructed from positive definite operators. A strictly irreversible mass exchange law, expressed in the difference of Gibbs free energies of the exchanging components, is proposed. Furthermore, the <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocities</b> of each Navier-Stokes set are investigated, since their realness is required for well-posedness of the equations. For both Navier-Stokes sets with multiple pressures, the <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocities</b> are proven to be real for arbitrary N. The canonical problem of complex characteristics of incompressible multiphase flows with a single pressure is revisited. A {{solution to this problem}} is found by generalizing the standard algebraic Stokes drag law to a positive definite operator acting on the velocity difference. In this way, effects of forces due to nonuniform velocity field...|$|R
