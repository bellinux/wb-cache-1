This suggests that Australia's apparently low savings level and CAD are not necessarily a significant problem. As long as the investment that is being funded by overseas <b>capital</b> <b>inflow</b> generates sufficient returns to pay for the servicing costs in the future, the increase in foreign liabilities can be viewed as sustainable in the longer term.|$|E

40|$|The East Asian {{crisis of}} 1997 - 98 and the Mexican crisis of 1994 {{generated}} much concern among policy analysts regarding {{the role of}} macroeconomic policies {{in the management of}} <b>capital</b> <b>inflows.</b> A series of economic reform measures including liberalization of foreign <b>capital</b> <b>inflows</b> were initiated in India since the early nineties. Using the vector autoregression (VAR) method, this paper specifically examines if the external shock generated by <b>capital</b> <b>inflows</b> led to appreciation in the real exchange rate as observed in the East Asian and Latin American countries in the 1990 ’s. The role of monetary and fiscal policies in managing the effect of <b>capital</b> <b>inflows</b> on the real exchange rate is also analysed in this context. Based on the quarterly data from 1993. 2 to 2001. 4 and incorporating the variables such as the real exchange rate, <b>capital</b> <b>inflows,</b> the rate of growth of domestic credit and the rate of inflation, three important observations emerge from the VAR analysis: (a) unlike the East Asian and Latin American countries, the real exchange rate depreciates with respect to one standard deviation innovation to <b>capital</b> <b>inflows,</b> (b) the dynamic impact of random disturbances generated by <b>capital</b> <b>inflows</b> on the real exchange rate is persistent, and (c) the dynamic response of the real exchange rate to <b>capital</b> <b>inflows</b> shock has largely been influenced by monetary policy and not by fiscal policy. The paper argues that the monetary policy was effective in avoiding any serious distortion in the real exchange rate following the liberalization of <b>capital</b> <b>inflows</b> in India while sacrificing its long-term objectives. It addresses two limitations in the existing macroeconomic policies i. e. (a) lack of fiscal consolidation and (b) lack of capital control instruments which seems to have created undesirable pressure on the monetary policy to realize its long-term objectives in the regime of liberalized <b>capital</b> <b>inflows.</b> Key Words: economic reforms, real exchange rate, macroeconomic policies, vector autoregression, India JEL Classification: C 32, E 63, F 30, F 4...|$|R
