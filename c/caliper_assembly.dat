50|$|Caliper Clearance (X-factor): The {{amount of}} {{clearance}} {{built into the}} wheel {{to allow for the}} vehicle's disc brake and <b>caliper</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Brake <b>caliper</b> <b>assembly</b> usually {{consisting}} {{of one or}} two hollow aluminum or chrome-plated steel pistons (called caliper pistons), a set of thermally conductive brake pads and a rotor (also called a brake disc) or drum attached to an axle.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent {{release of}} the brake pedal/lever allows the spring(s) in the master {{cylinder}} assembly to return the master piston(s) back into position. This action first relieves the hydraulic pressure on the caliper, then applies suction to the brake piston in the <b>caliper</b> <b>assembly,</b> moving it back into its housing and allowing the brake pads to release the rotor.|$|E
2500|$|Braking: Standard finned {{aluminum}} {{drum brakes}} were again offered and were effective. The Bendix 4 piston disk brake units were available. 12" [...] x 1" [...] vented steel rotors were {{coupled with the}} cast iron <b>caliper</b> <b>assemblies.</b>|$|R
50|$|The P6 was steered by a {{lightweight}} {{rack and pinion}} designed by Bowin, with an energy absorbing steering column surmounted by a leather-covered steering wheel. It had 9.75 in disc brakes with alloy <b>caliper</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The twin braking system was adjustable for length and had an adjustable-ratio balance control. The rear brakes were mounted inboard on the gearbox to reduce unsprung weight. The wheels were magnesium, with 10 x 13 in in front and 12 x 13 in or 14 x 13 in in the rear.|$|R
25|$|The brake <b>caliper</b> is the <b>assembly</b> {{which houses}} the brake pads and pistons. The pistons are usually made of plastic, {{aluminium}} or chrome-plated steel.|$|R
50|$|Often used in disc brakes, {{the brake}} <b>caliper</b> <b>assembly</b> {{consists}} {{of one to}} two hollow aluminum or chrome-plated steel pistons (caliper pistons). Brake calipers {{are one of the}} most important parts of a vehicle and are essential for your car's ability to stop.The job of the caliper is to slow the car's wheels using the friction they create with metal disks (rotors). They work by taking the pressure given by the master cylinder to force the pistons against the rotor. The development and use of disc-type brakes began in England in the 1890s. The first caliper-type automobile disc brake was patented by Frederick William Lanchester in his Birmingham factory in 1902. In a disc-braking system the rotors are attached to the car's wheels and spin together.|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{model has}} been developed to reproduce the dynamics of a disk brake assembly. The final aim is to derive an accurate model for predicting brake squeal {{at an early stage}} of development, when changing the geometry of the brake is still possible. The disk has been modeled analytically as a thin plate, its parameters have been identified by considering a complex FE model able to reproduce accurately the actual disk vibration modes. The brake <b>caliper</b> <b>assembly</b> (i. e. stationary part of the brake) has been modeled by a lumped parameter model for both the caliper and the pistons and by a simple finite element model representing the two pads. Also the parameters of the stationary part have been identified. Both the disk model and the stationary part model have been assembled together, by connecting them by means of constant stiffness springs. A complex eigenvalue analysis has been completed to investigate the dynamic stability of the system. The noise index, defined as the ratio between real part of eigenvalue and the module of the eigenvalue, has been used to predict the brake squeal phenomenon. Some unstable modes have been identified. A sensitivity analysis has been completed on the considered brake assembly. The effects of the most relevant design variables, such as pad geometry, disk height, caliper stiffness and pad springs have been quantitatively assessed...|$|E
50|$|Suspension {{was usually}} {{adapted from the}} East German Barkas minivans and teams filled the strut legs with {{in-house}} mixed oils to enhance their performance. Half-axles often came from the soviet-made UAZ all-terrain capable jeeps and minivans. Deceleration was provided by aftermarket-drilled soviet Lada brake discs, paired with east German, four-piston Wartburg <b>calipers.</b> The steering <b>assembly</b> was often adopted from east German Trabant mini-compact cars, but required extensive customization to fit available space.|$|R
