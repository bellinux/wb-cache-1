30|$|Each cycle entails two {{rotations}} of the crankshaft for engines {{fueled by}} diesel or gasoline. Understanding the <b>cycle’s</b> <b>four</b> <b>strokes</b> {{is a key}} to understanding how the engine type works. “Four-strokes” to the cycle takes place continuously as the engine runs. In practice, this cycle happens one after the next in every cylinder of the engine.|$|R
50|$|Two stroke engines rely on {{effective}} scavenging {{in order}} to operate correctly. This clears out the combustion exhaust gases from the previous cycle and allows refilling with a clean mix of air and fuel. If scavenging falters, the mixture of unburnable exhaust gas with the new mixture may produce an overall charge that fails to ignite correctly. Only when this charge is enriched by a second volume of clean mixture does it become flammable again. The engine thus begins to fire every second <b>cycle</b> (every <b>four</b> <b>strokes),</b> rather than correctly on every cycle. Four-stroking begins gradually, so the engine first starts to run with an unpredictable mixture of two- and four-stroke cycles. When severe, this may even become six- or eight-stroking.|$|R

40|$|Visual {{stimulus}} which {{occupies a}} large area of an observer's visual field and moves uniformly can induce illusory motion perception of the observer's self-body in the direction opposite to its motion (vection). Psychophysical experiment with 11 observers was executed {{in order to examine}} whether two and <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> apparent motions can induce vection or not. It has been known that two frames of visual pattern which are slightly shifted with each other can create an impression of continuous motion toward designated direction, using luminance reversal pattern (<b>Four</b> <b>stroke</b> motion) or introducing brief blank inter-stimulus interval (Two stroke motion). Vection strengths measured by magnitude estimation were compared between conditions of the two and the <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> motion, conventional apparent motion, and original motion sequence with 60 Hz refresh rate (real motion). Experiments revealed that both the two and the <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> motions can induce self-motion perception with considerable strength. The <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> motion and the conventional apparent motion can induce self-motion perception as strong as the one induced by the real motion. The two stroke motion induced weaker vection than the <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> motion or real motion, with least smoothness of motion among the conditions. The results suggested that an observer's perception of smoothness of the visual motion would affect strength of self-motion perception...|$|R

50|$|Gasoline-engine powered {{trimmers}} {{usually have}} a minimum of 21 cc displacement motors. At this size they can easily turn 2 mm line and some have nylon blades as accessories to the line-reel. A 32 cc engine can swing a 2.75 mm line and often has metal-blade accessories. Most trimmers use two stroke engines and require gasoline mixed with oil. Due to pollution laws <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> engines are becoming more popular {{with a number of}} commercial weed eater models now being powered by <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> engines. For instance, Honda, MTD and Craftsman manufacture a <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> engine trimmer. Other companies, such as John Deere, now carry low-emission two-stroke engine trimmers. Stihl manufactures a hybrid <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> engine trimmer using a technology called 4MIX. 4MIX trimmers have no oil reservoir. This engine is lubricated using pre-mixed gasoline, like a two-stroke engine.|$|R
