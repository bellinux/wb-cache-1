40|$|This Article {{considers}} the possible uses of <b>comparative</b> constitutional <b>law</b> in American constitutional interpretation. Surveying the {{debates about the}} uses of <b>comparative</b> constitutional <b>law</b> at the Founding, and tracing these debates to contemporary times {{by looking at the}} role of <b>comparative</b> constitutional <b>law</b> {{in the history of the}} U. S. Supreme Court, David Fontana suggests that a moderate, workable practice of using <b>comparative</b> constitutional <b>law</b> is consistent with the original intention of the Founders and has some precedent in the case law of the U. S. Supreme Court. This Article lays out a 2 ̆ 2 refined comparativist 2 ̆ 2 approach, whereby a court would consider <b>comparative</b> constitutional <b>law</b> only when faced with a 2 ̆ 2 hard case, 2 ̆ 2 the <b>comparative</b> constitutional <b>law</b> can add something distinctive to American constitutional interpretation, and the contextual differences between the United States and the country the American court is considering borrowing from are slight. This Article then defends this refined comparativist model, paying particular attention to several strands of contemporary constitutional scholarship, before applying refined comparativism to address the constitutionality of hate speech...|$|R

40|$|By {{highlighting}} {{the many ways}} that constitutions vary, <b>comparative</b> constitutional <b>law</b> raises interesting and important causal questions: What explains cross-national constitutional variation, {{and what are the}} real-world consequences of different constitutional arrangements? But <b>comparative</b> constitutional <b>law</b> scholarship so far has done relatively little to address these issues of constitutional causes and consequences in a rigorous manner. In this paper, I argue that scholars have much to gain from taking causality seriously in <b>comparative</b> constitutional <b>law,</b> and I suggest that scholarship on comparative politics and comparative political economy provides useful insights about how this might be done. First, I provide an overview of recent <b>comparative</b> constitutional <b>law</b> scholarship to highlight the pervasive issues of causality that it raises. Second, I introduce some of the interesting work that political scientists and economists have done on <b>comparative</b> constitutional <b>law.</b> They are asking questions about the origins and consequences of constitutions that are similar to those raised in <b>comparative</b> constitutional <b>law</b> scholarship - but they are framing them in explicitly causal terms, developing positive theories about cause-and-effect relationships, and testing them empirically using social science methods of inference. Third, I illustrate one such method {{that can be used to}} address causal claims and causal questions in <b>comparative</b> constitutional <b>law.</b> Using regression analysis of cross-national data on constitutions, government spending, and other institutional, demographic and economic factors in 80 democracies, I test a series of hypotheses about the effects of different constitutional arrangements on government spending. I also show how multiplicative interaction terms can be used to model and empirically test for conditional relationships between constitutions and various political, social or economic outcomes. I conclude with a proposed agenda for empirical <b>comparative</b> constitutional <b>law,</b> outlining its theoretical, methodological and pedagogical implications...|$|R
