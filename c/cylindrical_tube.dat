5|$|The {{clarinet}} is a musical-instrument family {{belonging to}} the group known as the woodwind instruments. It has a single-reed mouthpiece, a straight <b>cylindrical</b> <b>tube</b> with an almost cylindrical bore, and a flared bell. A person who plays a clarinet is called a clarinetist (sometimes spelled clarinettist).|$|E
5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>tube</b> and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E
25|$|Samovar-like pottery {{was found}} in Shaki, Azerbaijan in 1989. It was {{estimated}} to be at least 3,600 years old. While it differed from modern samovars in many respects, it contained the distinguishing functional feature of an inner <b>cylindrical</b> <b>tube</b> that increased the area available for heating the water. Unlike modern samovars, the tube was not closed from below, and so the device relied on an external fire (i.e. by placing it above the flame) instead of carrying its fuel and fire internally.|$|E

25|$|The {{pipe organ}} {{is another example}} of a {{potentially}} dipole sound source being driven as a monopole source. An air jet is directed at a sharp edge setting up flow oscillations as in the edge tone. The edge is part of a generally <b>cylindrical</b> <b>tube</b> of length L. An example is shown in the figure on the right. The unstable jet drives fluid alternately into the tube and out. The streamlines clearly are distorted from those of the free edge tone. There is a stagnation point opposite the source. The dashed lines, colored in red, are those most strongly modified. The red streamlines in the tube are now augmented by the oscillatory flow in the tube, a superposition of resistive and reactive dipole flow and resistive acoustic flow.|$|E

2500|$|For example, the Gaussian {{curvature}} of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>tube</b> is zero, {{the same as}} for the [...] "unrolled" [...] tube (which is flat). On the other hand, since a sphere of radius R has constant positive curvature Rminus&2 and a flat plane has constant curvature 0, these two surfaces are not isometric, even locally. Thus any planar representation of even a part of a sphere must distort the distances. Therefore, no cartographic projection is perfect.|$|E

The design of these tapers affects the intonation of the instrument. As with other brass instruments, sound is produced by blowing air through pursed lips producing a vibration that creates a standing wave in the instrument.|$|E
2500|$|This {{design of}} {{incinerator}} has 2 chambers: a primary chamber and secondary chamber. [...] The primary chamber in a rotary kiln incinerator {{consists of an}} inclined refractory lined <b>cylindrical</b> <b>tube.</b> The inner refractory lining serves as sacrificial layer to protect the kiln structure. This refractory layer needs to be replaced from time to time. Movement of the cylinder on its axis facilitates movement of waste. In the primary chamber, there is conversion of solid fraction to gases, through volatilization, destructive distillation and partial combustion reactions. The secondary chamber is necessary to complete gas phase combustion reactions.|$|E

It proves more useful to define the Reynolds number in terms of the mean flow velocity because this quantity remains well defined even in the case of turbulent flow, whereas the maximal flow velocity may not be, or in any case, {{it may be difficult to}} infer. In this form the law approximates the Darcy friction factor, the energy (head) loss factor, friction loss factor or Darcy (friction) factor [...] in the laminar flow at very low velocities in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>tube.</b> The theoretical derivation of a slightly different form of the law was made independently by Wiedman in 1856 and Neumann and E. Hagenbach in 1858 (1859, 1860). Hagenbach was the first who called this law the Poiseuille's law.|$|E

They can therefore learn but little about the outside world, and {{it is surprising that}} they should exhibit some skill in lining their burrows with their castings and with leaves, {{and in the case of}} some species in piling up their castings into tower-like constructions. But it is far more surprising that they should apparently exhibit some degrees of intelligence instead of a mere blind instinctive impulse, in their manner of plugging up the mouths of their burrows. They act in nearly the same manner as would a man, who had to close a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>tube</b> with different kinds of leaves, petioles, triangles of paper, &c., for they commonly seize such objects by their pointed ends. But with thin objects a certain number are drawn in by their broader ends. They do not act in the same unvarying manner in all cases, as do most of the lower animals; for instance, they do not drag in leaves by their foot-stalks, unless the basal part of the blade is as narrow as the apex, or narrower than it.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation on the effects of wavy <b>cylindrical</b> <b>tubes</b> in a staggered heat exchanger tube bundle. Experimental measurements and large eddy simulation (LES) technique were used to study the turbulent flow characteristics in a staggered tube bundle arrangement at a sub-critical Reynolds number of Re = 7500. The aim of this investigation is to compare the flow characteristics of a new configuration of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>tubes</b> with that of a similar arrangement which comprises purely circular cylinders. The first row of circular tubes is replaced by a row of wavy <b>cylindrical</b> <b>tubes.</b> The result of the experiment shows that the mean velocity distributions and turbulence intensity, obtained by the present LES method, are in good agreement with the Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA) measurements. The wake patterns around the second row of cylinders become more well organized upon the introduction of wavy cylinders of optimal wavelength (λ/Dm = 6). The turbulent kinetic energy behind the first row of tubes is also reduced. The power density spectra of the vortex shedding in the tube bundle are evidently suppressed. As a result, the fluctuating forces of the tube bundles are weakened. However, the drag is not noticeably reduced by such modification. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
