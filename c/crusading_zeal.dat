In 1986, he re-entered the political arena when he won the Ortoire/Mayaro seat and was reappointed Attorney General and Minister of Legal Affairs. As Minister of National Security in 1990, along with the then Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson and other parliamentary colleagues, he was held hostage in The Red House (parliament building), where he was shot and beaten. Although he tendered his resignation after that incident, it was not accepted by the Prime Minister.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cessation}} of general hostilities did not diminish Stevens' <b>crusading</b> <b>zeal</b> against the natives. He encouraged fratricidal war by offering the [...] "good Indians" [...] a bounty for scalps of the [...] "bad Indians". The largest collector of such rewards was Chief Seattle's sworn rival, Chief Patkanim, a leader among the Snoqualmie and Snohomish. According to Speidel, Patkanim was not above killing and scalping his own slaves {{as a means}} of generating income. Speidel also narrates (in Sons of the Profits) that on one occasion this led to a native being killed and scalped in Stevens' own office.|$|E
5000|$|Crozier {{was made}} {{a member of the}} Manchester Guardian's board and was {{appointed}} editor in April 1932 after the death of Edward Taylor Scott. Crozier's appointment was in part intended to guarantee editorial continuity, and he maintained a close control over the paper, frequently contributing leading articles and editorials. Foreign news had always been Crozier's chief interest and his editorship coincided with the establishment of the National Socialist regime in Germany and the Second World War. Working closely with his friend and sometime German correspondent, F. A. Voigt, Crozier [...] "considered it no less than his duty personally and persistently to expose the Nazis" [...] (Morris) and he pursued this policy with a <b>crusading</b> <b>zeal</b> until the very end. In the late 1930s his health became increasingly frail and he suffered from a perforated ulcer in 1936. In June 1936 he was elected to serve on the Liberal Party Council. In 1943 he was diagnosed with the heart condition which proved ultimately to be fatal.|$|E

Despite protestations of innocence, Gherardi was forced to stay away from his home for six months. The charges were dropped when court-ordered double-blind tests showed that Gherardis son could not write. In the same year, Rimland reported in a New York Times article that he knew of about 25 cases where families were accused through facilitated communication of sexually abusing their children.|$|E
50|$|The 18th century {{opened with}} England {{still reeling from}} recent revelations {{about the extent of}} illegal exports of wool to France. In 1697, eight 'owlers' (illegal {{exporters}} rather than smugglers who were illegal importers) were earmarked for solemn impeachment. They escaped by making a full confession and paying a total of £20,000 in fines. Parliament then rushed through an act forbidding anyone who lived within a fifteen-mile distance from the sea from buying wool unless he could produce documentary evidence that he intended to sell it inland from the 'exclusion zone'. To enforce the legislation, the government appointed a number of 'riding officers'. The first surveyor general of riding officers. Captain Henry Baker, wanted to mount a vigorous campaign against the owlers. Among his plans was the hiring of spies and double agents in Calais and Dieppe. During his incumbency wool smuggling in Sussex and Kent was drastically reduced. In 1703, he was sufficiently confident to recommend that the number of riding officers could be reduced to save money. Unfortunately he was soon proved wrong but his successor lacked his <b>crusading</b> <b>zeal.</b> In any case, after the Act of Union 1707 anti-smuggling resources were switched away from England to Scotland. By the Georgian era the system had spread to cover the entire country.|$|E
5000|$|At {{first the}} {{strategy}} appears {{to work as}} Shardik bursts from the cage at a crucial stage in the first battle with the Beklans and scatters them in terror. As a result the Ortelgans are fired up with <b>crusading</b> <b>zeal</b> and carry on to take Bekla (capital of the empire) {{and control of the}} empire shortly afterward. Kelderek becomes the priest king of Bekla and stylizes his name as Crendrik, the [...] "Eye of God" [...] He searches for Shardik who has escaped to a remote region and brings him back to Bekla, imprisoning him in a barred enclosure. He feels this is necessary to legitimize his rule, although he never appears to have any qualms about the cruelty this is inflicting on Shardik who is visibly wasting away. Instead, Kelderek becomes obsessed with the idea that Shardik will reveal the great secret purpose of his power to him, and spends much of his days beside the bear, watching him through the bars. Although Kelderek is king of Bekla, this is more of an honorary title and real control rests with his generals who control the military. Nevertheless, Kelderek has real powers over trade policy and it is his decision to revive the slave trade in order to gain revenues for Bekla to fund their fight against the southern rebels who are resisting Ortelgan rule. The slavery also includes children, and so Kelderek Play-With-The-Children ends up enslaving them.|$|E
40|$|The file {{associated}} with this record is embargoed until 12 months after the date of publication. The final published version may be available through the links above [...] Francesco Fanzago — the name of our young doctor — {{had just returned from}} two years’ training at the hospital in Pavia, at what was Lombardy’s university. Here, he had studied under Johann Peter Frank, the noted German scholar of hygiene and legal medicine and proponent of public health reforms. Fanzago (1764 - 1836) returned to his native Veneto, to Padua where he had taken his degree, full of curiosity and <b>crusading</b> <b>zeal,</b> which he applied to pellagra. His committed and methodical examination of hospital cases, and his undogmatic presentation of his findings, was also consistent with the approach outlined by the Scottish physician John Gregory, whose work on medical ethics Fanzago had just translated into Italian. From the start, Fanzago’s concerns were as much social as nosological, and he would spend the next twenty - five years of his life studying and writing about the disease. More {{than anyone else in the}} Veneto, he was the physician who put his name to pellagra; not that there were not other claimants to the title, as we shall see. Post-prin...|$|E
40|$|On October 22, 1965 a {{crowd of}} some three hundred people {{gathered}} in Hartsville, South Carolina to witness the dedication of a local site as a registered national historic landmark [Rogers and Nelson, 1994, p. 269]. The site was unusual in some ways, as it did not memorialize some local bigwig's boyhood home or stand tribute to some long-forgotten military skirmish. Rather, the site was that of an old farm, the original experimental farm of a local seed breeder named David R. Coker. The plaque {{put up on the}} site that day carried the following inscription: In 1902, in the field directly across from this marker, David R. Coker began the first successful commercial cotton improvement program in the United States based on scientific plant breeding. Subsequently, he founded Coker's Pedigreed Seed Company, and through this organization extended his efforts with equal success to include most of the principal southern field crops. In this undertaking, his close associate was George James Wilds, dedicated plant breeder. Under Mr. Coker's direction, ably supported by a staff of loyal scientists, these farms became a center of scientific endeavor. Combined with his signal success in plant breeding and his <b>crusading</b> <b>zeal</b> for improved agricultural methods, Mr. Coker's inspiring example of selfless devotion to Southern farmers resulted in his becoming widely acclaimed as the South's foremost agricultural statesman]Rogers and Nelson, 1994, p. 269]. Even after discounting the puffery expected on such memorials, the Department of the Interior's marker contained more than an element of truth. The subject of the tribute, David R. Coker [...] "Mr. D. R., " as he was known locally [...] was one of the more important and interesting, if little remembered business figures in the early-twentieth-century South. Not only was Coker one of the first practitioners of modern agribusiness in the Southeast, but, in addition, he seems in many ways an exemplar of the Chandlerian model of "visible...|$|E
40|$|The {{very first}} {{criterion}} {{is that a}} good editorial is an opinion maker. If it is based on evidence, so much the better. But it analyses evidence rather than produces it. Of course what it analyses can be the basis of the production of new evidence. But it is more like the 'Results and Discussion' that follow 'Materials and Method' in a research paper in so far as it is an objective analysis. However, it goes beyond an analysis. It must necessarily also express an opinion. It must attempt to critically analyse and sift from the various opinions, analyses and evidences floating around. It must present a refreshing perspective on an issue so as to retain balance when writings get opinionated; and/or stir up the crotchety and crusty when scientific/creative stupor sets in. Moreover, a good editorial is contemporary without being populist. It tackles recent events and issues, and attempts to formulate viewpoints based on an objective analysis of happenings and conflicting/contrary opinions. An editorial is predominantly about balance. But that does not prevent it from occasionally stirring things up, when such is the need. Hence a hard-hitting editorial is as legitimate as a balanced equipoise that reconciles apparently conflicting positions and controversial posturings, whether amongst politicians (in news papers), or amongst researchers (in academic journals). All said and done, the element of balance can never be lost. For that, it certainly helps if an editor is a balanced individual by temperament as well. However, let it not mean that balance in temperament excludes <b>crusading</b> <b>zeal.</b> Most editors of some merit have the latter in reasonable quantity, although they may play it down, or publicly make a mockery of it, since it is the in thing to do (the mockery, not the crusading). Moreover, denial can be a strong defense mechanism, as much in editors as in the rest of humanity. [No abstract available. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contends that}} the dominant religious constituency in the United States, evangelical Christianity, needs a more adequate political theology to anchor its increasing political influence and responsibility in the public square. It notes that the theology of Karl Barth, broadly speaking, has had little direct influence among this constituency, and that Barth’s political theology has had even less so. It argues that a particular reading of Barth’s political theology offers important resources for evangelical participation in public life, and that it addresses key aspects of American evangelical identity {{in ways that are}} particularly distinctive, fitting, and generative. Working from David Bebbington’s broadly-accepted typology for evangelical identity the first chapter draws on history and sociology to consider how these characteristics play out politically in an American evangelical context. It suggests, first, that American evangelical activism expresses itself as a markedly optimistic, but at times crusading, belief that Christians should work to see society significantly transformed to reflect the Kingdom of God; second, its cruci-centrism entails a larger soteriology by which the doctrine of election is uniquely taken up by the nation-state of America; third, its conversionist emphasis leads to understandings of social and political influence that remain markedly individualistic versus social, ecclesial, or institutional in orientation, and, fourth, its Biblicism leads it to read scripture with a literalist hermeneutic than can often be arbitrary in application, as well as employed to underwrite a distinctly American geo-politics. Chapter two examines claims that a more Lutheran political theology might be necessary to correct the Puritan-rooted, <b>crusading</b> <b>zeal</b> that continues to characterise American evangelicals in the political realm. Chapter three considers the significant ways the Reformed doctrine of election has influenced America’s sense of exceptionalism, with a particular concern for how such a soteriological doctrine has been used historically to underwrite hubristic military interventions and the violation of human rights. This chapter presents Barth’s doctrine of election, with its universalistic implications, as a possible means to ‘myth modification’ in America. Chapter four focuses on American evangelicals’ tendency to view social change through a conversionist framework. This chapter draws on Barth’s occasional political writings, as well as his discussion of ethics in the Church Dogmatics, to suggest an account of political responsibility that is sympathetic to evangelical concerns while challenging its inadequacies. Chapter five concludes by addressing evangelicals’ concern to approach their theo-politics Biblically. The chapter argues that Barth offers a better way forward than the literalist and at times arbitrarily ‘Biblical’ geo-politics of evangelicals.
