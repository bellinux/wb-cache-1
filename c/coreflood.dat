30|$|The <b>coreflooding</b> setup used in {{this study}} {{consists}} of two back pressure regulators at the outlet of each core holder.

30|$|Some {{studies showed}} a {{positive}} correlation between bulk foam stability tests and <b>coreflood</b> stability tests under oil-free conditions. Vikingstad and Aarra (2009) used a blender to disperse air for generating foam at a somewhat higher temperature (50  °C). They noted the decrease in foam height with time and compared results with <b>coreflood</b> stability tests in which N 2 and surfactant solution were simultaneously injected at a moderate rate and pressure to yield a transitional foam quality (qT = 40  ml/h, Pinj = 120  bar/ 1764 psig, and Fg = 80 %). They observed that the foam stability and strength were similar in both bulk foam stability tests and <b>coreflood</b> stability tests in oil-free conditions. Also, Jones et al.

30|$|Bulk foam {{stability}} tests identified {{the highest and}} lowest performing surfactants correctly, though the individual attributes (peak foamability, foam longevity, foam decay rate, and residual foaming) did not always correlate well with <b>coreflood</b> tests.

Then, the viscosity of the fluid increased and caused the pressure drop to increase; therefore, the viscous fluid (Na 3 HEDTA) will divert the fresh injected HEDTA (low viscosity fluid) to the less permeable core sample in the parallel <b>coreflooding.</b>|$|R

40|$|Foam, {{produced}} during surfactant enhanced water-alternating-gas (SAG) injection, reduces the mobility ratio {{by increasing the}} displacement fluid (gas) viscosity; furthermore, it can block high permeability zones leading to increased recovery efficiency. This study presents a comparative laboratory study of two nonionic surfactants (Ivey-Sol 108 and TX- 100) {{in a series of}} SAG <b>coreflooding</b> tests. The effects of surfactant type, concentration, brine salinity, injection scheme and the addition of a sacrificial adsorption agent to the secondary waterflooding on oil recovery were evaluated. Several foam stability measurement tests using dynamic and static methods were conducted to examine the foam stability of the different solutions that were used in <b>coreflooding</b> tests. Two main mechanisms behind the use of surfactants to enhance oil recovery are (1) reduction in interfacial tension and (2) alteration of wettability.

30|$|Considering the {{above-mentioned}} immiscible WAG <b>coreflood</b> experiment and history matching results of fluid properties {{as well as}} MMP, a one-dimensional compositional model was established using the reservoir simulator CMG. A grid system of 50  ×  1  ×  1 was selected to represent the physical model in the experiment, resulting in a grid block size of 1.34  cm ×  2.23  cm ×  2.23  cm.

30|$|The main {{chemicals}} {{used in this}} study are surfactants, alkali, and polymer. The chemicals selected were 1 wt% NaCl brine and crude oil during phase behavior and <b>coreflood</b> experiments. Pure CO 2 (99.99  % purity) was used during CWAG and WAG floodings. The crude oil used for phase behavior and <b>coreflood</b> experiments had a viscosity of 1.6 cP and a density of 0.8  g/cm 3 at 85  °C, respectively. The acid value of the crude oil was 0.37  mg KOH/g oil. 1 wt% NaCl was used during saturation, brine injection, waterflooding, WAG, and CWAG.|$|E
30|$|Based on <b>coreflooding,</b> {{the effects}} of crude oil {{presence}} on foam mobility reduction was extremely significant for the amphoteric surfactant but was much less pronounced for Blend- 1.

Moreover, the numerical inversion methods can be applied to large-scale reservoirs.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of carbonated water injection (CWI) as an EOR and CO 2 storage technique is studied in this thesis. When carbonated water (CO 2 saturated water) contacts oil during injection into oil reservoirs, because of higher solubility of CO 2 in hydrocarbons compared to water, CO 2 will migrate from water into oil phase. Therefore, oil mobility, {{and in turn}} oil recovery, will increase. In addition, CO 2 can also be stored securely in reservoir during CWI. The compositional simulation approach {{should be used for}} {{simulation of}} CWI in order to capture the mechanisms and the changes of composition happening during CWI process. However, the conventional compositional approach {{is based on the assumption}} of instantaneous thermodynamic equilibrium. That is, it assumes that the CO 2 is transferred and distributed between oil and water phases very fast such that the thermodynamic equilibrium state is reached instantaneously. However, the CWI <b>coreflood</b> experiments presented in the literature show that during CWI, the CO 2 transfer between water and oil phases happens slowly and therefore, the assumption of instantaneous equilibrium is not valid during the simulation of CWI <b>coreflood</b> experiments. As a result, the available compositional simulators cannot simulate CWI <b>coreflood</b> experiments correctly. Hence, in this thesis, a new compositional simulator is developed, in which the assumption of instantaneous equilibrium is relaxed by including the kinetics of mass transfer. To evaluate the performance of the developed simulator and to explore its generic capability, two different sets of CWI <b>coreflood</b> experiments performed in a water-wet and a mixed-wet (aged) sandstone core are selected from the literature. These <b>coreflood</b> experiments are simulated and studied in detail including the role of oil swelling and wettability alteration during CWI process. The simulator can predict the production profiles of oil, water and CO 2; the CO 2 storage profile; the differential pressure across the core and the CO 2 concentration in oil and water phases. The impacts of dispersion, injection rate and carbonation level on the performance of CWI process are investigated using the developed simulator. The simulator shows that the dispersion effect on oil production is minimal here during the <b>coreflood</b> experiments. It is also shown that at low injection rates and high carbonation levels, higher oil recovery will be obtained by CWI. In addition, at low injection rates, more CO 2 can be stored in core during the <b>coreflood</b> experiments with a lower and delayed CO 2 production at the core outlet. Moreover, the compositional simulator of ECLIPSE 300 (E 300) is used to simulate the CWI <b>coreflood</b> experiments and its capability is compared to the capability of the developed simulator. E 300 over predicts the oil recovery of CWI <b>coreflood</b> experiments due to the assumption of instantaneous equilibrium made by ECLIPSE 300. A dimensionless number so-called equilibrium number (Ne) is introduced and it is shown that at a specific range of Ne values, the assumption of instantaneous equilibrium made by E 300 is acceptable. Accordingly, it is shown that at reservoir-scale, the system will reach the equilibrium state and therefore E 300 can be used to simulate the CWI process at reservoir-scale. Based on this, finally, the reservoir-scale simulation of CWI is studied employing the ECLIPSE 300 simulator. The impacts of some influential parameters on CWI performance are investigated using the results of reservoir-scale simulation...|$|E

Polymer was meant to provide better volumetric sweep efficiency to improve oil recovery with less volume of chemical injected. After water injection of a saturated berea core with oil and brine until reaching approximately residual oil saturation, the scenario was to inject with 0.5 PV surfactant SAE- 01 A followed by 1 PV polymer slug and chased by water injection.

40|$|Silicate gel {{has been}} mostly used for near well treatment. A field {{test in the}} Snorre {{reservoir}} on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) has been planned, where {{the object of the}} test is to technically qualify silicate gel for deep placement. Compared with other types of gel, silicate gel is relative inexpensive, environmentally friendly and flexible. The chemistry and polymerization process of silicate gels is complex. The silicate gel gelation time is affected by several parameters such as pH, temperature and concentration of the components. In order to optimize the silicate injection test planned in the Snorre reservoir, several experiments on silicate gel were conducted at the International Research Institute of Stavanger (IRIS). Bulk gelation, static and dynamic <b>coreflood</b> experiments were performed, with the aim of studying the kinetics and strength of the silicate gel. The experimental data obtained from the experiments were used to model the <b>coreflood</b> experiments to get {{a better understanding of the}} gel behaviour. The commercial numerical simulator, STARS was used for this purpose. Gel modelling capabilities in STARS is primarily based on a defined chemical reaction, and the adsorption/retention of a defined pure blocking gel. The formation of gel in STARS is dictated by the chemical reaction implemented into the simulator and the reaction rate of the reactants. Gel modelling in STARS was not fully understood, since large amount of gel was created in the start of the run. To solve this issue, a critical gelation time and critical gel concentration terms were introduced, in order to reach the maximum gel adsorption level at the predetermined gelation time. The blocking effect in STARS is mainly controlled by the reduced water permeability factor RKW, which is primarily affected by the residual resistance factor RRF. Dynamic <b>coreflood</b> and static <b>coreflood</b> were modelled to study the gelation time and the gel strength. In the dynamic <b>coreflood,</b> the relative effluent concentration and differential pressure were sampled during the experimental work. To be able to match the differential pressure, the RRF had to be adjusted at the plugging time of the core. The relative effluent concentration matched well with the data obtained from the simulation results at high injection rates. By changing the order of reaction of the reacting components, a better match can be obtained for the lower injection rates. For the static <b>coreflood</b> the mobility reduction RF, and the residual resistance factor, RRF were sampled during the experimental work. A good match was obtained for the RF. To be able to match the RRF, connected with the differential pressure during the experiment, the adsorption had to be set as irreversible at 5000 < RRF < 20, and reversible outside this range. Utilising the STARS simulator gel creation and behaviour modelling capabilities it is possible to simulate and match silicate gel treatment results observed from various experimental <b>coreflood</b> runs...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{experiments}} - injecting pure CO 2 into carbonate cores - {{showed that}} the process is a win-win technology, sequestrating CO 2 while recovering {{a significant amount of}} hitherto unrecoverable natural gas that could help defray the cost of CO 2 sequestration. In this thesis, I report my findings on the effect of flue gas ??impurities?? on the displacement of natural gas during CO 2 sequestration, and results on unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests to carbonate samples. In displacement experiments, <b>corefloods</b> were conducted at 1, 500 psig and 70 ??C, in which flue gas was injected into an Austin chalk core containing initially methane. Two types of flue gases were injected: dehydrated flue gas with 13. 574 mole% CO 2 (Gas A), and treated flue gas (N 2, O 2 and water removed) with 99. 433 mole% CO 2 (Gas B). The main results of this study are as follows. First, the dispersion coefficient increases with concentration of ??impurities??. Gas A exhibits the largest dispersion coefficients, 0. 18 - 0. 25 cm 2 /min, compared to 0. 13 - 0. 15 cm 2 /min for Gas B, and 0. 15 cm 2 /min for pure CO 2. Second, recovery of methane at breakthrough is relatively high, ranging from 86 % OGIP for pure CO 2, 74 - 90 % OGIP for Gas B, and 79 - 81 % for Gas A. Lastly, injection of Gas A would sequester the least amount of CO 2 as it contains about 80 mole% nitrogen. From the view point of sequestration, Gas A would be least desirable while Gas B appears to be the most desirable as separation cost would probably be cheaper than that for pure CO 2 with similar gas recovery. For UCS tests, <b>corefloods</b> were conducted at 1, 700 psig and 65 ??C {{in such a way that}} the cell throughput of CO 2 simulates near-wellbore throughput. This was achieved through increasing the injection rate and time of injection. <b>Corefloods</b> were followed by porosity measurement and UCS tests. Main results are presented as follows. First, the UCS of the rock was reduced by approximately 30 % of its original value as a result of the dissolution process.

This work quantifies permeability damage when acidizing using hydrochloric acid mixed with seawater and no scale inhibitors. Scale inhibitors were also tested for effectiveness in reducing calcium sulfate scale during acidizing. Static jar tests of three phosphonate-based, two sulphonated polymer-based, and one polyacrylic-based scale inhibitors in spent acid systems were used to compare the effectiveness at temperatures ranging from 77 to 325 ?F. <b>Corefloods</b> were conducted to investigate the extent of calcium sulfate precipitation without scale inhibitors and to test permeability improvements with the addition of compatible scale inhibitors at temperatures up to 325 ?F.

40|$|Low {{salinity}} {{water flooding}} (LSF) {{has been proved}} to be a promising enhanced oil recovery method for sandstone reservoirs. The efficiency of LSF in carbonate reservoirs has not been proven completely yet, because there are still uncertainties about the LSF recovery mechanism in carbonate. From experimental studies, it was shown that wettability alteration, due to salinity reduction, is able to mobilize the remaining oil. Some studies attributed the wettability alteration by LSF to Calcite dissolution. Furthermore, Calcite dissolution can influence the salinity and pH of injected brines, and hence the oil recovery. However, {{there is a lack of}} experimental data on the Calcite dissolution effect of LSF in carbonate rock. The objective of this experimental study was to get a better understanding of the Calcite dissolution behaviour and how it might affect the oil recovery. Bulk and <b>coreflood</b> experiments have been performed; the experimental data was history matched with the use of PHREEQC. Calcite dissolution decreased with decreasing PCO 2 and increased with decreasing pH and increasing NaCl salinity from 500 - 2000 PPM. Increasing the injection rate reduced the interaction time and therefore Calcite dissolution did not reach equilibrium in <b>coreflood</b> at high rates. Calcite dissolution from chalk matched with the Calcite dissolution from pure Calcite, while Calcium concentration in effluent from limestone was higher. The two-phase <b>coreflood</b> experiment confirmed that Calcite dissolution occurs as well if oil is present in the porous media, but showed lower values than in single-phase <b>coreflood</b> experiment. pH increased from 5 - 6 to 9. 5 due to Calcite dissolution, which might have an effect on the rock and oil surface charges, and hence oil recovery improvement. The effluent of the two-phase <b>coreflood</b> showed that an emulsion was formed, which suggested formation of in-situ surfactants. From CT scans, micro-CT scans and material mass balance calculations an increase in porosity around 1 % was observed. The increase in the total dissolved species due to Calcite dissolution was not significant, which will not harm LSF effect.

In this dissertation, <b>coreflood</b> tests were applied {{for the first time}} to determine the removal efficiency of filter cake generated by water-based drilling fluids based on the micronized ilmenite under high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) conditions. The capacity of different acids to dissolve the micronized ilmenite was also evaluated. Near-wellbore conditions during the drilling fluid injection and the mudcake cleanup process in sandstone and carbonate cores at reservoir conditions were simulated by <b>coreflood</b> tests. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP), computerized tomography (CT) scans, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the solubility of iron and titanium, chemical composition of dried mudcake, and internal structure of the core, respectively. A complete analysis of the particle size and chemical composition of the ilmenite sample was conducted using Coulter Counter, SEM, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Several solubility tests were conducted under 200 ?F to find an optimal solvent to dissolve the micronized ilmenite sample. The solvents include different concentrations of HCl, HEDTA, glycolic acid, formic acid, and a mixture of HCl and HEDTA. An acid solution containing 15 wt% HCl and 8 wt% HEDTA dissolved 98. 4 wt% of iron and 76. 5 wt% of titanium from the ilmenite sample.

30|$|Having {{a number}} of {{considering}} factors could bring a problem of vague conclusion in the oil recovery study {{or it could be}} even a misconclusion about the considering factors. This mistake would result in an ineffective oil production due to its wrong design. For example, the nanofluids of polymer-coated was used in the <b>coreflooding</b> experiment to evaluate the recovery mechanism studied by Choi et al. (2017). The study only reported the oil-aqueous IFT and fluids viscosity as the properties related to the <b>coreflooding</b> test without the surface wettability measurement (e.g. contact angle). However, the authors concluded that the wettability alteration was a mechanism to enhance oil recovery highlighting the nanofluids as the potential injection agent. In this case, the governing mechanism would possibly be the decrease in the mobility ratio (oil to water viscosity) rather than the change in the oil-aqueous IFT because the oil-aqueous IFT showed a negative impact on the oil recovery (i.e. the oil-aqueous IFT increased as the nanofluids were added). Thus, the method to separate the contribution of each factor is needed to emphasise the fundamental insight into the study of oil recovery.|$|R
