500|$|In 1982, Enrique Descals {{described}} an aquatic hyphomycete Tricladiopsis flagelliformis growing from submerged leaves {{found in the}} shoreline of Windermere (Cumbria, England), which he tentatively assigned as the anamorph state of Coccomyces dentatus. The specific epithet flagelliformis (from the Latin flagellum [...] "whip" [...] and formis [...] "shape") refers to the [...] "whip-like" [...] form of the <b>conidium.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, {{from the}} stomata, hyphae extend out and elongate, {{branching}} into sterigmata or conidiophores (spore-bearing structures). [...] These then asexually bud into <b>conidium</b> spores. [...] These structures create the characteristic grayish-white down-like appearance of downy mildew. [...] Unlike other oomycetes, or Peronosclerospora, P. philippinensis {{is not known}} to produce oospores. There is no known sexual stage {{of the life cycle}} for P. philippinensis.|$|E
50|$|Beauveria {{species are}} white entomopathogenic fungi. They form {{unicellular}} conidia that are typically hydrophobic and very small. The conidia are formed holoblastically from basally inflated conidiogenous cells. After <b>conidium</b> production, the conidiogenous cell elongates before producing another <b>conidium</b> atop a small denticle (a narrow projection bearing a <b>conidium</b> or sporangium). The {{result is the}} formation of a distinctive, slender, zig-zag rachis. Colonies of Beauveria species are typically white or off-white on artificial culture media.|$|E

50|$|Conidiophores of T. roseum {{are usually}} erect and are 200-300μm in length. They arise singly or in loose groups. Conidiophores are simple hyphae, which are septate in their lower half, and bear {{clusters}} of conidia at the tip. These conidiophores are indistinguishable from vegetative hyphae until {{production of the}} first <b>conidium.</b> <b>Conidium</b> development is distinctive and was first described by Ingold in 1956. Conidia arise as blowouts {{from the side of}} the conidiophore apex which is thus incorporated into the base of each spore. After the first <b>conidium</b> is blown out, before it matures, the apex of the conidiophore directly below blows out a second <b>conidium</b> from the opposite side. Conidia are pinched out from the conidiophore one after another in alternating directions in order to form the characteristic zigzag patterned chain. Conidia of T.roseum (15-20 × 7.5-10 μm) are smooth and clavate. Each <b>conidium</b> is two celled with the apical cell being larger than the curved basal cell. Conidia are light pink and appear translucent under the microscope. They appear a more saturated pink colour when grown in masses in culture or on the host surface.|$|E
50|$|Conidia (singular: <b>conidium)</b> are spores {{produced}} {{at the tip}} of special branches called conidiophores.|$|E

5000|$|The phialide {{development}} and <b>conidium</b> formation in A. clavatus has been examined using TEM. And by using SEM, {{it was discovered}} that the first-formed <b>conidium</b> and phialide share a continuous wall. Additionally recombination with an albino mutant led to the production of heterokaryotic conidial heads with mixed conidial colours. A GC-content of 52.5-55% was also detected upon DNA analysis. And its soluble wall carbohydrates consist of mannitol and arabitol.|$|E
50|$|Most fungi {{can produce}} asexually and sexually. Sexual {{selection}} {{has been studied}} to occur more predominantly in the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla. Neurospora crassa is a filamentous, hermaphroditic fungus that is widely studied as a model organism and belongs to the Ascomycota phylum. Once a haploid fungus within N. crassa has attracted or has been attracted to a mate of a different mating type, it will develop either a protoperithecium or <b>conidium</b> to sexually fertilize or both structures to self-fertilize. Protoperithecia formation occurs in environments of low nitrogen The protoperithecium will act as the female gamete as the recipient of a nucleus while the <b>conidium</b> which will act as the male gamete donating a nucleus. Fertilization occurs once the <b>conidium</b> of a different mating type makes contact with the trichogyne, a structure of the protoperithecium. The two cells from both the protoperithecium and <b>conidium</b> fuse, yet their nuclei remain separate until ascus formation has occurred. The two nuclei then fuse to form a cell containing a diploid nucleus which then undergoes two rounds of meiosis and one mitotic division to ultimately form eight haploid nuclei, four of each mating type.|$|E
50|$|Colonies of M. thermophila {{initially}} appear cottony-pink, but rapidly turn cinnamon-brown and granular in texture. It can {{be distinguished}} from the closely related Myceliophthora lutea by the thermophilic character of the former, and its more darkly pigmented, markedly obovate conidia. Microscopic examination reveals septate hyphae with several obovoidal to pyriform conidia arising singly or in small groups from conidiogenous cells. Conidia are typically 3.0-4.5μm x 4.5-11.0μm in size, hyaline, smooth, and thick-walled. Occasionally a secondary <b>conidium</b> can form at the distal tip of primary <b>conidium.</b>|$|E
50|$|Blastoconidium is a holoblastic <b>conidium</b> that is {{produced}} singly or in chains, and detached at maturity leaving a bud scar, {{as in the}} budding of a yeast cell.|$|E
50|$|A {{study has}} shown that female-biased genes evolve must faster than male-biased genes {{demonstrated}} by a rapid protein-level evolution. In most other eukaryotes, male-biased genes demonstrate a faster evolution. This {{may be due to}} specific reproductive traits within fungi, possibly allowing female-female competition to occur rather than male-male competition. This is also supported the passive nature of conidia during mating. Due to the presence of pheromones as well as the dispersal of male gametes, two or more female gametes may be attracted to one <b>conidium,</b> or male gamete. The presence of karyogamy further supports the possibility of female-female competition. Within N. crassa, the haploid mycelium undergoes growth as vegetative tissue prior to entering the mating cycle. This vegetative tissue {{can be used as a}} source of fertilization and can fuse with the trichogyne. This causes the female gamete to no longer be subject to male-male competition and further fertilization by a <b>conidium.</b> The female-biased genes that were studied and seen to evolve more rapidly than male-biased genes did so regardless of the mechanism of fertilization. Fertilization occurring by the fusion of a female nucleus and male <b>conidium</b> nucleus or between a female nucleus or nucleus from vegetative tissue did not alter this rate of evolution.|$|E
50|$|Colletotrichum somersetense is a morphologically cryptic species {{described}} by J.A Crouch in 2014. This species belongs to Colletotrichum caudatum sensu lato {{and is a}} pathogen on warm-season grasses (Sorghastrum nutans). Presence of a unique filiform appendage {{at the apex of}} the <b>conidium</b> is the distinctive morphological character.|$|E
50|$|Asexual morphs are hyphomycetes with simple, {{branched}} conidiophores. Asexual spores (conidia) are hyaline {{to brown}} in colour with transverse septa. The typical pyriform shape and 2-septate <b>conidium</b> morphology is characteristic for Pyricularia and Neopyricularia. Other genera have obclavate to more ellipsoid 2-septate conidia. Deightoniella and Macgarvieomyces evolved 1-septate conidia.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolution}} of the <b>conidium</b> from the sporangiospore is the main defining difference between zygomycetes and ascomycetes. The {{evolution of}} sporangiospores typical of zygomycetes to conidia {{similar to those found}} in ascomycetes can be modeled by a series of forms seen in zygomycetes. Many zygomycetes produce multiple sporangiospores inside a single sporangium. Some have evolved multiple small sporangiola that contain few sporangiospores. In some cases, there may be a few as three spores in each sporangiolum, and a few species have sporangiola which contain just a single spore. Choanephora, a zygomycete, has a sporangiolum that contains one spore with a sporangium wall that is visible {{at the base of the}} sporangium. This structure is similar to a <b>conidium,</b> which has two, fused cell walls, an inner spore wall and an outer sporangium wall.|$|E

50|$|Pseudogymnoascus destructans Minnis & Lindner was {{initially}} described in 1996 as Geomyces destructans by Gargas et al. In 2013, further {{analysis of the}} phylogenetic relationship moved this species to the genus Pseudogymnoascus. The <b>conidium</b> of this species are hyaline and characteristically curved. This species was first isolated from infected hibernating bats in New York state. Recently, this species has been isolated from cave environments no longer inhabited by hibernating bats.|$|E
50|$|CAT {{biology is}} not {{completely}} understood. Initially, conidia are induced to form CATs. Once they are formed, they grow homing toward each other, and eventually they fuse. Once fusion occurs, the respective nuclei can pass through the fused CATs from one <b>conidium</b> to the other. These are events of fungal vegetative growth (asexual reproduction) and not sexual reproduction. Part of the CAT fusion (cell fusion) have been show to be a coordinated behaviour.|$|E
50|$|In culture, B. bassiana grows {{as a white}} mould. On {{most common}} {{cultural}} media, it produces many dry, powdery conidia in distinctive white spore balls. Each spore ball is composed of a cluster of conidiogenous cells. The conidiogenous cells of B. bassiana are short and ovoid, and terminate in a narrow apical extension called a rachis. The rachis elongates after each <b>conidium</b> is produced, resulting in a long zig-zag extension. The conidia are single-celled, haploid, and hydrophobic.|$|E
50|$|Maturing colonies Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, produce conidial {{anastomosis}} tubes (CATs) between conidia {{before leaving}} the host and before germination, {{in contrast to the}} genetic model fungus Neurospora crassa (bread mould) that produces conidial anastomosis tubes from conidia and conidial germ tubes during germination. Other Colletotrichum species produce conidial anastomosis tubes as well. The initial characterization of CATs was made in this plant pathogen in 2003 by Roca et al. in Brazil. CATs first form 15 days after the start of fruiting body development and grow from the conidia. As they grow, they may either fuse with other CATs, as evidenced by fusion points, or make direct contact with another <b>conidium.</b> Because each <b>conidium</b> creates CATs, the result is a network of conidia all connected together. The CAT network is developed very quickly, often within 1 hour of the first CAT connection. The exact purpose of this connection network is unclear, but it permits free flow of cytoplasm, proteins, organelles and even nuclei between conidia. It is unclear whether these CATs can play a role in genetic recombination, as no sexual stages for C. lindemuthianum has been found in nature.|$|E
50|$|Yeasts such as Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans produce budded cells {{known as}} blastoconidia. The {{formation}} of blastoconidia involves three basic steps: bud emergence, bud growth, and <b>conidium</b> separation. During bud emergence, the outer cell {{wall of the}} parent cell thins. Concurrently, new inner cell wall material and plasma membrane are synthesized at the site where new growth is occurring. New cell wall material is formed locally by activation of the polysaccharide synthetase zymogen. The process of bud emergence is regulated by the synthesis of these cellular components {{as well as by}} the turgor pressure in the parent cell. Mitosis occurs, as the bud grows, and both the developing <b>conidium</b> and the parent cell will contain a single nucleus. A ring of chitin forms between the developing blastoconidium and its parent yeast cell. This ring grows in to form a septum. Separation of the two cells leaves a bud scar on the parent cell wall. The bud scar contains much more chitin than does the rest of the parent cell wall. When the production of blastoconidia continues without separation of the conidia from each other, a pseudohypha, consisting of a filament of attached blastoconidia, is formed. In addition to budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae, yeasts such as Candida albicans may form true hyphae.|$|E
5000|$|When a <b>conidium</b> or blastospore of Isaria fumosorosea {{lands on}} a {{suitable}} host, it produces enzymes {{to penetrate the}} insect's cuticle. A germ tube then grows into the haemocoel [...] and the fungus proliferates inside the insect’s body. The fungus can also enter through the spiracles, the mouth or the anal opening. The mycelia spread in the haemolymph and tissues, eventually emerging from the insect and producing conidia. Mortality of the insect has been ascribed to the drainage of its nutrients, the destruction of its tissues {{and the release of}} toxins.|$|E
50|$|Curvularia {{defined by}} the type species C. lunata (Wakker) Boedijn. Curvularia lunata appears as shiny velvety-black, fluffy growth on the colony surface. C. lunata is {{distinguished}} by septate, dematiaceous hyphae producing brown, geniculate conidiophores. The poroconidia are curved slightly to distinctly, transversely septate, with an expanded third cell from the pore end of the <b>conidium.</b> Curvularia can be easily distinguished from Bipolaris and Drechslera spp. since the conidia are non-distoseptate, that is, septate from edge to edge of the conidial wall. The teleomorphic state of the type species Curvularia lunata is Cochliobolus lunatus (Fam. Pleosporaceae, Ord. Pleosporales, Cla. Loculoascomycetes, Phy. Ascomycota).|$|E
50|$|On {{malt extract}} agar, the {{structural}} morphology of A. clavatus {{appears to be}} different than in Czapek’s solution agar. The typical strains extracted from malt media contain less abundant conidial structures, which could be larger in size. In other (non-typical) strains, the conidial heads increase in number but decrease in size. The conidiophores range from 300 to 500 μm and bear loose, columnar heads. Typical strains may be resembled by strong and unpleasant odor whereas non-typical strains are characterized being odorless. The colonies arising from one <b>conidium</b> on malt extract agar, consisted of 25X10^7 conidia after being observed for six days.|$|E
5000|$|Claviceps [...] {{species from}} tropic and subtropic regions produce macro- and microconidia in their honeydew. Macroconidia differ {{in shape and}} size between the species, whereas microconidia are rather uniform, oval to globose (5x3μm). Macroconidia are able to produce {{secondary}} conidia. A germ tube emerges from a macroconidium through {{the surface of a}} honeydew drop and a secondary <b>conidium</b> of an oval to pearlike shape is formed, to which the contents of the original macroconidium migrates. Secondary conidia form a white, frost-like surface on honeydew drops and spread via the wind. No such process occurs in Claviceps purpurea, Claviceps grohii, Claviceps nigricans, and Claviceps zizaniae, all from northern temperate regions.|$|E
5000|$|Pycnidia in Vermilacinia nylanderi are {{not always}} conspicuous, {{especially}} in the field, because they are often immersed in the cortex. They are nevertheless evident by the bump-like elevated areas along the cortical surface. Their abundance is conspicuous when the thallus is sectioned and examined under a dissecting microscope. Pycnidia in V. nylanderi are abundantly fertile as seen by conidia (<b>conidium</b> singular), which “are specialized, non-motile fungal spores,” that appear to function as re-establishing the lichen with an “appropriate photobiont,” a form of asexual reproduction, in contrast to “sterile pycnidia (conidia not evident) in V. leopardina. Conidia may also to function as “male gametes (spermatia)” ...|$|E
5000|$|The fungus is dimorphic {{growing in}} two {{distinct}} forms. It grows as hyphae at room temperature, but when conidia are transferred to 40 °C they convert to larger adiaspores. It has no teleomorphs and no sexual stage. It {{does not have}} any particular growth requirements in terms of culture media, but it is known to grow well on pablum cereal agar, potato dextrose agar (PDA) and phytone yeast extract agar. They also grow well on Sabouraud dextrose agar at 25 °C. Growth is slightly inhibited when grown in media containing cycloheximide. E. parva grows at a moderate pace, slower than E. crescens. After 21 days of growth at room temperature colony diameters range from 36 to 85 mm. The colonies are smooth and velvety and are white with tan centers from a top view and cream from the bottom. Hyphae in this form are septate and hyaline. The conidiophores they produce are unicellular, thick-walled (2 μm), and usually simple with a single terminal <b>conidium</b> also called an aleurioconidium. The conidiophore is also known to occasionally branch into 1-3 sections each bearing its own <b>conidium.</b> Before differentiating into adiaspores, the conidia measure 2-4 μm [...] in diameter and are shaped either ovoid, subglobose or pyriform with glabrous walls. After growth at 40 °C the conidia morph into their adiaspore form enlarging to approximately 25 μm in vitro and 40 μm in vivo. These adiaspores are uninucleate and they do not replicate. They are occasionally mistaken for spherules of the organism Coccidioides immitis.|$|E
5000|$|The sexual {{cycle of}} N. crassa is heterothallic. Sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) {{can only be}} formed when two mycelia of {{different}} mating type come together. Like other ascomycetes, N. crassa has two mating types that, in this case, are symbolized by A and a. There is no evident morphological difference between the A and a mating type strains. Both can form abundant protoperithecia, the female reproductive structure (see Figure). Protoperithecia are formed most readily in the laboratory when growth occurs on solid (agar) synthetic medium with a relatively low source of nitrogen. [...] Nitrogen starvation appears to be necessary for expression of genes involved in sexual development. [...] The protoperithecium consists of an ascogonium, a coiled multicellular hypha that is enclosed in a knot-like aggregation of hyphae. A branched system of slender hyphae, called the trichogyne, extends {{from the tip of}} the ascogonium projecting beyond the sheathing hyphae into the air. The sexual cycle is initiated (i.e. fertilization occurs) when a cell (usually a <b>conidium)</b> of opposite mating type contacts a part of the trichogyne (see Figure). Such contact can be followed by cell fusion leading to one or more nuclei from the fertilizing cell migrating down the trichogyne into the ascogonium. Since both A and a strains have the same sexual structures, neither strain can be regarded as exclusively male or female. However, as a recipient, the protoperithecium of both the A and a strains {{can be thought of as}} the female structure, and the fertilizing <b>conidium</b> can be thought of as the male participant.|$|E

50|$|During asexual {{reproduction}} N. sphaerica releases spores known as conidia. The conidia are ejected out forcefully at maximum horizontal distances of 6.7 cm, and 2 cm vertically. Discharge of spores occurs in all directions. The mechanism for projection {{relies on the}} conidiophore consisting of a flask-shaped support cell that bears the <b>conidium.</b> Liquid from the support cell squirts through the supporting cell projecting the spore outwards. This characteristic of forcible spore discharge is rarely seen in hyphomycetes. N. sphaerica requires moisture to release spores into the air, therefore accumulation begins around 2:00 a.m. with peak time of abundance occurring around 10:00 a.m. Spore count rapidly decreases after 10:00 a.m. and remains low throughout the day.|$|E
50|$|Alternaria alternata has {{no known}} resting sexual stage. Instead, it overwinters in {{infected}} plant debris through asexual spores called conidia. Their production can begin in {{as few as}} ten days after the first symptoms appear, and can continue for to up to fifty days. Because of this, the life cycle is known as poly-cyclic. Alternaria alternata's conidia disperse via air currents, and their release from the lesions can be triggered by rainfall, or even just a sudden increase in humidity. When the <b>conidium</b> lands on a leaf, it will wait until the nighttime dew, and then germinate. It can either enter through the stomata, or penetrate directly through {{the top of the}} leaf, using its appressorium, infecting the leaf within 12 hours.|$|E
50|$|A <b>conidium</b> may form germ tubes (germination tubes) and/or conidial {{anastomosis}} tubes (CATs) {{in specific}} conditions. These two {{are some of}} the specialized hyphae that are formed by fungal conidia. The germ tubes will grow to form the hyphae and fungal mycelia. The conidial anastomosis tubes are morphologically and physiologically distinct from germ tubes. After conidia are induced to form conidial anastomosis tubes, they grow homing toward each other, and they fuse. Once fusion happens, the nuclei can pass through fused CATs. These are events of fungal vegetative growth and not sexual reproduction. Fusion between these cells seems to be important for some fungi during early stages of colony establishment. The production of these cells has been suggested to occur in 73 different species of fungi.|$|E
50|$|Teleomorph of Alternaria alternata is Clathrospora diplospora. As a result, this {{pathogen}} propagates itself via asexual spores called conidia. These conidia are produced in lesions on mature or dying leaves. Their production can begin in {{as few as}} ten days after the first symptoms appear, and can continue for to up to fifty days. A. alternata’s conidia disperse via air currents, and their release from the lesions can be triggered by rainfall, or even just a sudden drop in humidity.

50|$|C. gloeosporioides is a hemibiotroph, {{meaning it}} lives part way between the biotrophic and {{saprophytic}} lifestyles. The pathogen prefers a living host, {{but once the}} host tissue dies, or the pathogen finds itself surviving in the soil without a host, it can switch to a saprophytic lifestyle and feed off of dead plant material. Under correct environmental conditions, if a C. gloeosporioides <b>conidium</b> lands upon a susceptible host it will first produce an appressorium. This specialized structure allows the pathogen to penetrate the host cuticle and cell wall through {{the production of a}} penetration peg. After penetration, the pathogen produces infection vesicles which invaginate the cell membrane, and drain nutrients from the plant. Later in the pathogen’s life cycle when the host’s infected fruit or foliar flesh dies, the pathogen switches to the saprophytic life cycle to feed off of the dead tissue.|$|E
