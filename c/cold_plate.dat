5|$|The {{unpressurized}} rotodome is 30feet (9.1m) in diameter, {{six feet}} (1.8m) thick at the center, and is held 11feet (3.4m) above the fuselage by two struts. It is tilted {{down at the}} front to reduce its aerodynamic drag, which lessens its detrimental effect on take-offs and endurance (which is corrected electronically by both the radar and secondary surveillance radar antenna phase shifters). The rotodome uses bleed air, outside cooling doors, and fluorocarbon based <b>cold</b> <b>plate</b> cooling to maintain the electronic and mechanical equipment temperatures. The hydraulically rotated antenna system permits the Westinghouse Corporation's AN/APY-1 and AN/APY-2 passive electronically scanned array radar system to provide surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the stratosphere, over land or water.|$|E

25|$|Molecular {{distillation}} is {{vacuum distillation}} below {{the pressure of}} 0.01 torr. 0.01 torr is one order of magnitude above high vacuum, where fluids are in the free molecular flow regime, i.e. the mean free path of molecules {{is comparable to the}} size of the equipment. The gaseous phase no longer exerts significant pressure on the substance to be evaporated, and consequently, rate of evaporation no longer depends on pressure. That is, because the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics no longer apply, mass transport is governed by molecular dynamics rather than fluid dynamics. Thus, a short path between the hot surface and the cold surface is necessary, typically by suspending a hot plate covered with a film of feed next to a <b>cold</b> <b>plate</b> with a line of sight in between. Molecular distillation is used industrially for purification of oils.|$|E
2500|$|A {{heat sink}} {{transfers}} thermal energy from a higher temperature device {{to a lower}} temperature fluid medium. The fluid medium is frequently air, but can also be water, refrigerants or oil. If the fluid medium is water, the heat sink is frequently called a <b>cold</b> <b>plate.</b> In thermodynamics a heat sink is a heat reservoir that can absorb an arbitrary amount of heat without significantly changing temperature. [...] Practical heat sinks for electronic devices must have a temperature higher than the surroundings to transfer heat by convection, radiation, and conduction. The power supplies of electronics are not 100% efficient, so extra heat is produced that may be detrimental to {{the function of the}} device. As such, a heat sink is included in the design to disperse heat.|$|E
60|$|Lord Monmouth's dinners at Paris were celebrated. It was {{generally}} agreed {{that they had no}} rivals; yet there were others who had as skilful cooks, others who, for such a purpose, were equally profuse in their expenditure. What, then, was the secret spell of his success? The simplest in the world, though no one seemed aware of it. His Lordship's plates were always hot: whereas at Paris, in the best appointed houses, and at dinners which, for costly materials and admirable art in their preparation, cannot be surpassed, the effect is always considerably lessened, and by a mode the most mortifying: by the mere circumstance that every one at a French dinner is served on a <b>cold</b> <b>plate.</b> The reason of a custom, or rather a necessity, which one would think a nation so celebrated for their gastronomical taste would recoil from, is really, it is believed, that the ordinary French porcelain is so very inferior that it cannot endure the preparatory heat for dinner. The common white pottery, for example, which is in general use, and always found at the cafés, will not bear vicinage to a brisk kitchen fire for half-an-hour. Now, if we only had that treaty of commerce with France which has been so often on the point of completion, the fabrics of our unrivalled potteries, in exchange for their capital wines, would be found throughout France. The dinners of both nations would be improved: the English would gain a delightful beverage, and the French, {{for the first time in}} their lives, would dine off hot plates. An unanswerable instance of the advantages of commercial reciprocity.|$|E

Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam's. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn't have. Makes you want to sing after. Lacaus esant taratara. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you don't know how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask you another. Good idea if you're stuck. Gain time. But then you're in a cart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she's on for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew!

Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.

40|$|The Internal Active Thermal Control System (IATCS) coolant {{exhibited}} unexpected chemical {{changes during}} the first year of on-orbit operation following the launch and activation in February 2001. The coolant pH dropped from 9. 3 to below the minimum specification limit of 9. 0, and re-equilibrated between 8. 3 and 8. 5. This drop in coolant pH was shown to be the result of permeation of CO 2 from the cabin into the coolant via Teflon flexible hoses which created carbonic acid in the fluid. This unexpected diffusion was the result of having a cabin CO 2 partial pressure higher than the ground partial pressure (average 4. 0 mmHg vs. less than 0. 2 mmHg). This drop in pH was followed by a concurrent increasing coolant nickel concentration. No other metal ions were observed in the coolant and based on previous tests, the source of nickel ion was thought to be the boron nickel (BNi) braze intermetallics used in the construction of HXs and <b>cold</b> <b>plates.</b> Specifically, BNi 2 braze alloy was used for the IATCS IFHX and BNi 3 braze alloy was used for the IATCS Airlock Servicing and Performance Checkout Unit (SPCU) HX and <b>cold</b> <b>plates.</b> Given the failure criticality of the HXs, a Corrosion Team was established by the IATCS CWG to determine the impact of the nickel corrosion on hardware performance life...|$|R

50|$|In 1971, {{geophysicist}} W. Jason Morgan further {{developed the}} hypothesis of mantle plumes. In this hypothesis, convection in the mantle transports heat from the core to the Earth's surface in thermal diapirs. In this concept, two largely independent convective processes occur in the mantle: the broad convective flow associated with plate tectonics, which is driven primarily by the sinking of <b>cold</b> <b>plates</b> of lithosphere back into the mantle asthenosphere, and mantle plumes, which carry heat upward in narrow, rising columns, driven by heat exchange across the core-mantle boundary. The latter type of convection is postulated to be independent of plate motions.|$|R

The module was placed between two aluminum <b>cold</b> <b>plates</b> to remove heat. The module itself consisted of two parallel printed circuit boards, with components mounted either {{on one of the}} boards or between the two boards.

30|$|Previous self-consistent spherical 3 D {{models of}} plate {{tectonics}} with a free-slip surface {{and a lower}} viscosity contrast between <b>cold</b> <b>plates</b> and hot mantle have had no problem to spontaneously initiate subduction (e.g. Foley and Becker 2009; Nakagawa et al. 2010; Rolf and Tackley 2011; Tackley 2000 a,b; van Heck and Tackley 2008). However, compared to the global models presented here, they all lack realistic single-sided subduction—a key feature of global mantle convection observed on Earth. The global model presented in this study, in contrast, develops nature-like subduction {{and is able to}} produce an episodic lid self-consistently even with a realistically high viscosity contrast (see Crameri and Tackley 2015).|$|R
