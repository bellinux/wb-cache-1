40|$|We have {{performed}} 2. 5 D and 3 D simulations of <b>conical</b> jets <b>driven</b> by {{the rotation of}} an ordered, large-scale magnetic field in a stratified atmosphere. The simulations cover about three orders of magnitude in distance to capture the centrifugal acceleration {{as well as the}} evolution past the Alfvén surface. We find that the jets develop kink instabilities, the characteristics of which depend on the velocity profile imposed {{at the base of the}} flow. The instabilities are especially pronounced with a rigid rotation profile, which induces a shearless magnetic field. The jet’s expansion appears to be limiting the growth of Alfvén mode instabilities. Key words.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{follow-up}} {{of a previous}} study on the interaction between upward-breaking conical structures and level ice in a centrifuge. New {{data were collected from}} a series of ten ice sheets grown at an inertial acceleration equivalent to 30 times Earth's gravity (30 g). A small <b>conical</b> structure was <b>driven</b> against this ice, which ranged in thickness from 5 to 20 mm. Interaction velocities between the structure and the ice were 7, 10, 40 and 100 mm/s and inertial accelerations were 1 (noram gravity), 30, 60, 80 and 120 g. Cones with slopes of 45, 60 and 75 deg. with respect to the horizontal were used. A description of ice rubble build-up against the cone is presented. The horizontal and vertical loads are compared with a prediction algorithm taking into account the 3 D nature of the ice loads. The influence of displacement rates is also discussed.

40|$|The present {{numerical}} study aims at shedding {{light on}} the mechanism underlying the precessional instability in a sphere. Precessional instabilities {{in the form of}} parametric resonance due to topographic coupling have been reported in a spheroidal geometry both analytically and numerically. We show that such parametric resonances can also develop in spherical geometry due to the <b>conical</b> shear layers <b>driven</b> by the Ekman pumping singularities at the critical latitudes. Scaling considerations lead to a stability criterion of the form, |P_o|>O(E^ 4 / 5), where P_o represents the Poincaré number and E the Ekman number. The predicted threshold is consistent with our numerical simulations as well as previous experimental results. When the precessional forcing is supercriticial, our simulations show evidence of an inverse cascade, i. e. small scale flows merging into large scale cyclones with a retrograde drift. Finally, it is shown that this instability mechanism may be relevant to precessing celestial bodies such as the Earth and Earth's moon. Comment: published on PoF 201...|$|R
40|$|To better {{characterize}} {{the assembly of}} the HIV- 1 core, we have used electron cryo-tomography (ECT) to image infected cells and the viral particles cryo-preserved next to them. We observed progressive stages of virus assembly and egress including flower-like flat gag lattice assemblies, hemispherical budding profiles and virus buds linked to the plasma membrane via a thin membrane neck. The population of budded viral particles contains immature, maturation intermediate and mature core morphologies. Structural characteristics of the maturation intermediates suggest that the core assembly pathway involves {{the formation of a}} CA sheet that associates with the condensed ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Our analysis also reveals a correlation between RNP localization within the viral particle and the formation of conical cores, suggesting that the RNP helps <b>drive</b> <b>conical</b> core assembly. Our findings support an assembly pathway for the HIV- 1 core that begins with a small CA sheet that associates with the RNP to form the core base, followed by polymerization of the CA sheet along one side of the conical core towards the tip and then closure around the body of the cone...|$|R
40|$|In some {{gas turbine}} aeroengines, the HP {{compressor}} {{is driven by}} the H. P. turbine through a <b>conical</b> shaft or <b>drive</b> cone. This drive cone is enclosed by a stationary surface that forms the supporting material for the combustion chambers. Air used to cool the turbine blades is directed into the space around the drive cone, and a major concern to an engine designer is the temperature rise in this air due to frictional dissipation and heat transfer. This paper presents results from a combined experimental and CFD investigation into the flow within an engine representative HP compressor drive cone cavity. The experimental results show similarities in flow structure to that found in classic rotor-stator systems. Both 2 -D and 3 -D CFD simulations were carried out using the FLUENT/UNS code. The 3 -D model which included the actual compressor blade tip clearance gave the best agreement with the experimental data. However, the computational resource required to run the 3 -D model limits its practical use. The 2 -D CFD model, however, was found to give good agreement with experiment, providing care was exercised in selecting an appropriate value of initial tangential velocity...|$|R
40|$|Molecules are {{traditionally}} treated quantum mechanically using the Born-Oppenheimer formalism. In this formalism, different electronic {{states of the}} molecule are treated independently. However, most photo-initiated phenomena occurring in nature are driven by the couplings between different electronic states in both isolated molecules and molecular aggregates, and therefore occur beyond the Born-Oppenheimer formalism. These couplings are relevant in reactions relating to the perception of vision in the human eye, the oxidative damage and repair of DNA, the harvesting of light in photosynthesis, and the transfer of charge across large chains of molecules. While these reaction dynamics have traditionally been studied with visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy, attosecond XUV pulses formed {{through the process of}} high harmonic generation form a perfect tool for probing coupled electronic dynamics in molecules. In this thesis, I will present our work in using ultrafast, XUV spectroscopy to study these dynamics in molecules of increasing complexity. We begin by probing the relaxation dynamics of superexcited states in diatomic O₂. These states can relax via two types of electronic couplings, either through autoionization or neutral dissociation. We find that our pump-probe scheme can disentangle the two relaxation mechanisms and independently measure their contributing lifetimes. Next, we present our work in observing a coherent electron hole wavepacket initiated by the ionization of polyatomic CO₂ near a conical intersection. The electron-nuclear couplings near the <b>conical</b> intersection <b>drive</b> the electron hole between different orbital configurations. We find that we can not only measure the lifetime of quantum coherence in the electron hole wavepacket, but also control its evolution with a strong, infrared probing field. Finally, we propose an experiment to observe the migration of an electron hole across iodobenzene on the few-femtosecond timescale. We present experimental modifications made to the high harmonic generation set-up in order to probe this ultrafast and elusive charge migration. These results demonstrate the potential of ultrafast, XUV spectroscopy in probing the inner-workings of electronic couplings occurring in nature...|$|R
50|$|With the DAF 600 - 55 each {{rear wheel}} was {{propelled}} individually {{by a pair}} of <b>conical</b> drums and <b>drive</b> belt with the effect of a limited slip differential: if a drive wheel on slippery road revs up, the other wheel can still transfer the full torque. This results in unusually good traction characteristics, which were also a reason for successes of the DAFs in rallies. There were several disadvantages that accompanied the lack of a true differential gear. Although each belt could settle (independent of the other) into its optimum position, thus allowing for wheel speed variation, the system was slow to operate and depended on the pulleys being turned. This led to rapid tire wear and placed stress on other transmission components. Snapped drive shafts were common. Low speed handling in icy conditions was interesting as the system tended to drive the car forward against the influence of the steered wheels. Later cars, the 46, 66 and Volvo variants were fitted with a differentially geared axle. A version with a differential was developed by Williams in the 1993 Williams FW15C CVT Formula One car, but it was banned before being raced. In testing there were problems with the heat production.|$|R
40|$|A {{plasmoid}} is {{a compact}} plasma structure with an integral magnetic field, {{that may be}} categorized according to the relative strength of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields. If B(sub p/B(sub t) much greater than 1 it is an FRC; if B(sub p) approximately equal to B(sub t), it is a Spheromak. A plasmoid thruster would operate by repetitively producing plasmoids that are accelerated to high velocity. The process is inductive, and the magnetic structure of the plasmoid suppresses thermal and mass losses, and improves detachment of the exhaust, This concept should be capable of producing an Isp {{in the range of}} 5, 000 - l 0, 000 seconds, with high thrust density. PTX is a device designed to study this concept. The plasmoid is formed inside of a single turn <b>conical</b> theta-pinch coil, <b>driven</b> by a 560 nF, 35 kV capacitor bank. Experiments conducted with a static-fill of propellant gas (6 % H 2 in He) demonstrated liable ionization over a pressure range of 40 - 200 mTorr. A fast gas-puff valve to inject propellant has since been added, and a ringing preionization circuit to independently control ionization has been tested, hydrogen, deuterium, argon, and an N 2 / H 2 mixture have been tried as propellants. Measurements of the plasmoid shape, mass, and velocity, using a variety of diagnostics will be presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of wind - a conical wind - has been {{discovered}} in axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the disk-magnetosphere interaction {{in cases where the}} magnetic field of the star is bunched into an X-type configuration. Such a configuration arises if the effective viscosity of the disk is larger than the effective diffusivity, or if the accretion rate in the disk is enhanced. Conical outflows flow from the inner edge of the disk into a narrow shell with half-opening angle of 30 - 45 degrees. The outflow carries about 0. 1 - 0. 3 of the disk mass accretion rate and part of the disk's angular momentum. The <b>conical</b> winds are <b>driven</b> by the gradient of the magnetic pressure which exists above the disk due to the winding of the stellar magnetic field. Exploratory 3 D simulations show that conical winds are symmetric about rotation axis of the disk even if the magnetic dipole is significantly misaligned with the disk's rotation axis. Conical winds appear around stars of different periods. However, {{in the case of a}} star in the "propeller" regime, an additional - much faster component appears: an axial jet, where matter is accelerated up to very high velocities at small distances from the star by magnetic pressure force above the surface of the star. The simulations are done in dimensionless units and are applicable to a variety of the disk-accreting magnetized stars: young stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and possibly black holes. For the case of young stars, conical winds and axial jets may appear in different cases, including Class I young stars, classical T Tauri stars, and EXors. In EXors periods of enhanced accretion may lead to the formation of conical winds which correspond to the outflows observed from these stars. Comment: 14 pages, 14 figures, submitted to the MNRAS.

40|$|A plasmoid, {{also called}} a compact toroid, is a compact plasma {{structure}} with an integral magnetic field, {{that may be}} categorized according to the relative strength of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field (Bp and Bt, respectively). An object with Bp/Bt much greater than 1 is called a Field Reverse Configuration (FRC); if Bp = Bt, it is called a Spheromak. The plasmoid thruster is a pulsed inductive device which operates by repetitively producing plasmoids that are accelerated and ejected at high velocity. As the process is inductive, this thruster avoids the problem of electrode erosion. Also, the magnetic structure of the plasmoid should suppress thermal and mass losses to the wall, and improve detachment of the plasma exhaust from the thruster. This concept should be capable of producing an Isp of 5, 000 seconds and greater, with thrust densities of order 10 (exp 5) N/sq m. The plasmoid thruster consists chiefly of a conical theta-pinch coil. Propellant is introduced onto a bias magnetic field, produced by an auxiliary coil, and is then pre-ionized, freezing in the magnetic field. The theta-pinch coil is then energized producing a field aligned anti- parallel to the bias field. The reversed field reconnects with the bias field to form the plasmoid. The magnetic pressure of the reversed field accelerates the plasmoid out of the thruster. A series of experiments have been conducted on the PTX device, which consisted of a single turn <b>conical</b> theta-pinch coil, <b>driven</b> by a 560 nF, 35 kV capacitor bank, which rang at a frequency of 500 kHz, and served all three functions required for formation: pre-ionization, bias field loading, and field reversal. Initial ionization was found to occur in an annular region at the exit plane of the coil, and {{was found to be}} reproducible with a variety of gases, including H 2, D 2, Ar, and an H 2 /N 2 mixture (75 % / 25 %). A fast gas valve for injecting propellant has been tested, as well as a ringing pre-ionization circuit (operating at 5 Mhz) to better control the plasmoid formation. Velocities as high as 20 km/s have been measured for a plasmoid propagating into a static back-fill of neutral gas. Magnetic field and density measurements indicate that the plasmoid retains its structure well into the down-stream exhaust region, and that it is capable of pushing a dense cloud of neutral gas in front of it. Further experiments will focus on the effects of coil geometry and bias-field strength on the performance of the device. A high-power solid-state switching system is being developed in order to replace the spark-gap switch...|$|R
