2500|$|The Moto Guzzi Grand Prix V8, {{introduced}} in 1955, was a 500cc racing motorcycle {{fitted with a}} V8 engine using dual overhead camshafts (DOHC). The engine was conceived by Giulio Carcano, Enrico Cantoni, Umberto Todero, Ken Kavanagh and Fergus Anderson just after the 1954 Monza Grand Prix and designed by Dr. Carcano.

2500|$|Exhaust steam is {{directed}} upwards {{out of the}} locomotive through the chimney, {{by way of a}} nozzle called a blastpipe, creating the familiar [...] "chuffing" [...] sound of the steam locomotive. The blastpipe is placed at a strategic point inside the smokebox that {{is at the same time}} traversed by the combustion gases drawn through the boiler and grate by the action of the steam blast. The combining of the two streams, steam and exhaust gases, is crucial to the efficiency of any steam locomotive, and the internal profiles of the chimney (or, strictly speaking, the ejector) require careful design and adjustment. This has been the object of intensive studies by a number of engineers (and often ignored by others, sometimes with catastrophic consequences). The fact that the draught depends on the exhaust pressure means that power delivery and power generation are automatically self-adjusting. Among other things, a balance has to be struck between obtaining sufficient draught for combustion whilst giving the exhaust gases and particles sufficient time to be consumed. In the past, a strong draught could lift the fire off the grate, or cause the ejection of unburnt particles of fuel, dirt and pollution for which steam locomotives had an unenviable reputation. Moreover, the pumping action of the exhaust has the counter-effect of exerting back pressure on the side of the piston receiving steam, thus slightly reducing <b>cylinder</b> <b>power.</b> Designing the exhaust ejector became a specific science, with engineers such as Chapelon, Giesl and Porta making large improvements in thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in maintenance time and pollution. A similar system was used by some early gasoline/kerosene tractor manufacturers (Advance-Rumely/Hart-Parr) – the exhaust gas volume was vented through a cooling tower, allowing the steam exhaust to draw more air past the radiator.|$|E

5000|$|The USRA 2-6-6-2 {{locomotive}} was a Mallet, or compound articulated type, having both low-pressure and high-pressure cylinders. The smaller high-pressure <b>cylinders</b> <b>powered</b> {{the rear}} set of driving wheels, {{and the larger}} low-pressure <b>cylinders</b> <b>powered</b> the forward set of driving wheels. The USRA 2-6-6-2 articulated locomotives were direct developments of the Chesapeake & Ohio class H2 and H4 series.|$|R

50|$|The Type 50 was a {{sporting}} coupe {{version of the}} Type 46. It rode on a shorter wheelbase, 122 in (3099 mm), and used a smaller 5.0 L (4972 cc/303 in³) version of the engine. This engine had squarer dimensions, however, at 86 by 107 mm, and twin camshafts actuated two valves per <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Power</b> output was impressive at 225 hp (167 kW).

5000|$|Phakic {{intraocular lens}} (PIOL) {{implantation}} inside {{the eye can}} also be used to change refractive errors. The newest type of intervention is a type of PIOL called the implantable collamer lens (ICL) which uses a biocompatible flexible lens which can be inserted in the eye via a 3 mm incision. The ICL is used to correct myopia ranging from −0.5 to −18 diopters, and +0.5 <b>cylinder</b> <b>power</b> to +6.0 for the Toric ICL models.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{different}} conventions for indicating the amount of cylinder: [...] "plus cylinder notation" [...] and [...] "minus cylinder notation". In the former, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>power</b> is a number of diopters more convergent than the sphere power. That means the spherical power describes the most divergent meridian and the cylindrical component describes the most convergent. In the latter, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>power</b> is a number of diopters more divergent than the sphere component. Thus the sphere power describes the most convergent meridian and the cylinder component describes the most divergent. Europe typically follows the plus cylinder convention while the US typically follows the minus cylinder convention. Minus cylinder notation is also more common in Asia, although either style may be encountered there. There is no difference in these forms of notation and {{it is easy to}} convert between them: simply add the sphere and cylinder numbers together to produce the converted sphere—then change the sign of the cylinder number. For example, a lens with a vertical power of -3.75 and a horizontal power of -2.25 could be specified as either -2.25, -1.50 or -3.75, +1.50.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} toric lens, the flattest and steepest curvatures are {{separated}} by 90°. As a result, the axis of the cylinder is also the meridian containing the sphere power. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>power,</b> as defined above is the power that is most different from the sphere power. Because they are defined relative to each other, {{it is important to}} know if the lens is being described in minus cylinder notation, where the sphere power is the most convergent / least divergent power. When using plus cylinder notation, the opposite is true.|$|E

5000|$|The only {{available}} engine for the Izis is a gasoline engine, a PSA Peugeot Citroën TU3A. With inline four cylinders, a displacement of 1360 cc and two valves per <b>cylinder</b> <b>power,</b> this engine produces 55.2 kW. The turning radius is 9.2 meters. From the factory, the Izis {{is available in}} over 100 finishes, with the possibility for customers to choose between a range of different accessories such as various steering wheels, interior trim and built-in appliances. The model is available so far only in Tunisia, Morocco, France and Panama [...] The Euro NCAP awarded the Izis 2 stars.|$|E
5000|$|The engine had a low optimum {{specific}} {{fuel consumption}} of 232 g/kWh which is equivalent to a maximum efficiency of 37%; a better efficiency {{than some of the}} diesel engines that were available {{at the time of its}} release. The valves are set at 46° and are accompanied by pistons with shallow valve pockets - thereby eliminating the need for a shorter connecting rod hence, allowing a suitable compression ratio to be achieved. Long spark plugs are used and positioned concentric to the <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Power</b> output was rated at 157 bhp. The later engine were suffixed C20XELN to indicate 'Low Noise' revisions (smaller cylinder head port, cast pistons, and different crank bearing size) in line with EU regulations ...|$|E

5000|$|The Spécial {{shared the}} 3996 cc (23CV) {{cylinder}} block of the Baby 23CV, {{but in this}} application the cylinder head was formed from light metal alloy and incorporated hemispherical combustion chambers above the cylinders. This {{made it possible for}} the cylinder valves, while still at this stage driven by a single camshaft, to be mounted in a narrow V formation, while a sparking plug was positioned centrally above each <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Power</b> was further enhanced by the fitting of twin Zénith-Stromberg 42 carburetters, providing [...] and a listed top speed of 160 km/h (101 mph). During 1938 the twin carburetter arrangements was replaced by triple Zénith 32 carburetters in pursuit if further power enhancement. In addition to providing a formidable level of power, the sophisticated cylinder head pointed the way to future developments which would culminate with the 1946 launch of the Talbot Lago Record, which would feature a twin camshaft arrangement cylinder.|$|E
50|$|From March 1965, the Admiral {{could also}} be ordered with the Chevrolet-sourced 4,638 cc V8 which had been fitted as {{standard}} since August 1964 in the Opel Diplomat.
