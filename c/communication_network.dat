However, both friends of Williamson and human rights organisations suggested that – given Williamson's status as an openly gay man – robbery might have been a secondary issue, with homophobia being the main motive behind the crime.|$|E
40|$|Distributed {{generation}} (DG) systems install <b>communication</b> <b>networks</b> {{for managing}} real-time energy imbalance. Different from previous research, which typically assumes perfect <b>communication</b> <b>networks,</b> this work aims to quantitatively {{account for the}} impact of degraded <b>communication</b> <b>networks</b> on DG systems performance. The degraded behavior of <b>communication</b> <b>networks</b> is modeled by stochastic continuous time transmission delays and packet dropouts. On the DG systems side, we consider the inherent uncertainties of renewable energy sources, loads and energy prices. We develop a Monte Carlo simulation-optimal power flow (MCS-OPF) computational framework that is capable of generating consecutive time-dependent operating scenarios of the integrated system. Quantitative analysis is carried out to measure the impact of <b>communication</b> <b>networks</b> degradation onto the DG systems. For illustration, the framework is applied to a modified IEEE 13 nodes test feeder. The results demonstrate that the degraded <b>communication</b> <b>networks</b> can significantly deteriorate the performance of the integrated system. A grey differential model-based prediction method for reconstructing missing data is effective in mitigating the influence of the degraded <b>communication</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

5|$|Malaysia {{established}} the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) {{to investigate the}} incident, working with foreign aviation authorities and experts. Malaysia has stated that a final report on Flight 370 will be released {{by the end of}} 2017. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished. Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were investigated, but eliminated as suspects. Malaysian police have identified the captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all others on the flight of suspicious motives. Power was lost to the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat's satellite <b>communication</b> <b>network</b> at 02:25—three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar. Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of Sumatra and the flight continued for six hours with little deviation in its track, ending when its fuel was exhausted.|$|E

This made Thelma the deadliest {{tropical}} cyclone in Philippine history, surpassing a storm in 1867 that killed 1,800, until later surpassed by Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in 2013 which killed at least 6,300people. A total of 4,446homes were destroyed while another 22,229were damaged. Total losses amounted to $27.67million. Initially, it took over 24hours for word of the disaster to reach officials due to a crippled <b>communication</b> <b>network</b> around Ormoc City. Within a few days, emergency supply centers were established and aid from various agencies under the United Nations and several countries flowed into the country.

5|$|The {{preceding}} bombing missions, {{together with}} resistance sabotage acts, hit the Germans heavily, interrupting railroads, damaging bridges, and disrupting the <b>communication</b> <b>network.</b> The landing {{started on the}} morning of 15August. Ships of the Western Naval Task Force approached under cover of darkness and were in position at dawn. The first of 1,300 Allied bombers from Italy, Sardinia, and Corsica began aerial bombardment shortly before 0600. Bombing was nearly continuous until 0730 when battleships and cruisers launched spotting aircraft and began firing on specific targets detected by aerial surveillance. Naval gunfire ceased as the landing craft headed ashore at 0800. The relatively steep beach gradients with small tidal range discouraged Axis placement of underwater obstacles, but landing beaches had been defensively mined. LCIs leading the first wave of landing craft fired rockets to explode land mines on the beaches to be used by following troops.|$|E
5|$|During flight, the {{aircraft}} maintains a datalink with a satellite <b>communication</b> <b>network</b> for data and telephone calls. The datalink connects {{the aircraft}} and a ground station via satellite, which translates (changes) the signal's frequency and amplifies the signal; the ground station {{is connected to}} telecommunication networks which allows messages {{to be sent to}} and received from other locations, such as the airline's operations centre. Normal communications from Flight370 were last made at 1:07MYT and the datalink between the aircraft and satellite telecommunication network was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03, when the aircraft did not acknowledge a message sent from the ground station. Three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar coverage—at 2:25—the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) transmitted a log-on message, which investigators believe occurred as the SDU started after a power interruption. Between the 2:25 message and 8:19, the SDU acknowledged two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, which were not answered, and responded to automated, hourly requests from the ground station that were made to determine whether the SDU was still active. None of the communications from 2:25–8:19 contain explicit information about the aircraft's location. The aircraft's final transmission at 8:19 was a log-on message; the aircraft did not respond to a message from the ground station at 9:15. Investigators believe the 8:19 log-on message was made when the SDU was restarting after the aircraft ran out of fuel and the aircraft's auxiliary power unit was started.|$|E
40|$|Airborne {{networks}} (ANs) with flight-to-flight communication {{have gained}} significant research interests over the years, {{due to the}} advantages such as transportability, flexibility, and broad-coverage.

However, as flight tests are costly, they are not easily accessible to many AN researchers.

In this study, I develop and test a model showing how newcomers develop their <b>communication</b> <b>networks</b> over time, and revealing how this dynamic aspect of the newcomer socialization process may facilitate newcomer adjustment and success in the workplace. I conduct a three-wave longitudinal study within the first 28 weeks of employment and find that institutionalized socialization tactics, task interdependence, and proactive personality partially help newcomers form their <b>communication</b> <b>networks.</b> Second, I find that newcomers' <b>communication</b> <b>networks</b> facilitate newcomer adjustment but only at time 2 (week 16) and time 3 (week 28). Third, findings only marginally support the proposition that newcomers' <b>communication</b> <b>networks</b> mediate the relationships between proactive personality and task mastery. However, newcomers' <b>communication</b> <b>networks</b> did not mediate the relationships between other two socialization factors - institutionalized socialization tactics and task interdependence - and newcomer adjustment. Fourth, findings generally support the proposition that newcomer adjustment predicts intrinsic career success.
