5|$|Screening for {{hypothyroidism}} {{is performed}} in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH. This {{has led to the}} early identification of many cases and thus the prevention of developmental delay. It is the most widely used newborn screening test worldwide. While TSH-based screening will identify the most common causes, the addition of T4 testing is required to pick up the rarer central causes of neonatal hypothyroidism. If T4 determination is included in the screening done at birth, this will identify cases of <b>congenital</b> <b>hypothyroidism</b> of central origin in 1:16,000 to 1:160,000 children.

25|$|Newborn {{screening}}: Newborn screening is used {{just after}} birth to identify genetic disorders {{that can be}} treated early in life. A blood sample is collected with a heel prick from the newborn 24–48 hours after birth {{and sent to the}} lab for analysis. In the United States, newborn screening procedure varies state by state, but all states by law test for at least 21 disorders. If abnormal results are obtained, it does not necessarily mean the child has the disorder. Diagnostic tests must follow the initial screening to confirm the disease. The routine testing of infants for certain disorders is the most widespread use of genetic testing—millions of babies are tested each year in the United States. All states currently test infants for phenylketonuria (a genetic disorder that causes mental illness if left untreated) and <b>congenital</b> <b>hypothyroidism</b> (a disorder of the thyroid gland). People with PKU do not have an enzyme needed to process the amino acid phenylalanine, which is responsible for normal growth in kids and normal protein use throughout their lifetime. If there is a buildup of too much phenylalanine, brain tissue can be damaged, causing developmental delay. Newborn screening can detect the presence of PKU, allowing kids to get put on a special diet right away to avoid the effects of the disorder.|$|E
2500|$|Newborn {{screening}} {{has expanded}} since {{the introduction of}} PKU testing in the 1960s, but can vary greatly between countries.

40|$|Objectives. Iodine {{deficiency}} {{is still}} a notable health-care problem in several regions of Europe and can be responsible for maternal and fetal goiter, miscarriages, stillbirths, reduced fetal growth, <b>congenital</b> <b>hypothyroidisms,</b> damaged reproduction in adult life, and inadequate development and maturation of the fetal brain, which is the major preventable cause of mental defects. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the medical students' knowledge and practices regarding the program of iodized-salt-use and active iodine prophylaxis program launched by the Italian Ministry of Health. Materials and Methods. A self-administered, anonymous, 19 single-item questionnaire was developed. We have collected 294 filled forms: 86 from first-year, 118 from fourth-year and 90 from sixth-year medical students at the First Medical School of 'Sapienza' University of Rome, Italy, in May 2009. Results. Two hundred eighty four students (96. 6 %) affirm that they know of the existence iodized salt, even though only 199 (67. 7 %) report personal consumption. This level is quite far from the target (consumption by almost 80 % of the general population) suggested by the international literature. No statistically relevant difference was observed between the answers of male and female students. Conclusions. Our study proves that clinical students have a more detailed knowledge on iodized salt if compared with pre-clinical students, but such knowledge remains overall defective and in sonic cases absolutely incorrect. Additional education is probably needed to prepare physicians to play a critical role in counseling about iodine prophylaxis. Clin Ter 2011; 162 (5) : 409 - 41...|$|R

40|$|<b>Congenital</b> primary <b>hypothyroidism,</b> or CH, is {{the most}} common {{disorder}} detected by newborn screening. It is caused by inadequate production of thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone is important for the normal functioning of all the body’s organs and is essential for normal brain development. The most common causes of primary hypothyroidism are total or partial failure of the thyroid gland to develop (aplasia or hypoplasia), or its development in an abnormal location (an ectopic gland). The screening program is not designed to detect less common causes of hypothyroidism such as those caused by pituitary insufficiency. Incidence The incidence of <b>congenital</b> primary <b>hypothyroidism</b> is estimated at 1 in 4, 000 live births. Characteristics Deficiency of thyroid hormone in an infant may result in mental and growth retardation if it is not diagnosed and treated early in life. Many infants with CH may appear clinically normal before three months of age, by which time some brain damage has usually occurred. When symptoms or signs are present, they may include prolonged neonatal jaundice, constipation, lethargy and poor muscle tone, feeding problems, a large tongue, puffy face, large fontanel, distended abdomen, and umbilical hernia. However, these signs and symptoms are nonspecific for CH, are found in fewer than 30 % of neonates with CH, and may be present in infants without the condition. Therefore, in the newborn, clinical signs and symptoms are not reliable indicators of CH.

40|$|<b>Congenital</b> central <b>hypothyroidism</b> (C-CH) is a {{rare disease}} in which thyroid hormone {{deficiency}} is caused by insufficient thyrotropin (TSH) stimulation of a normally-located thyroid gland.

Autosomal recessive TSH deficiency and thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor-inactivating mutations {{are known to be}} genetic causes of C-CH presenting in the absence of other syndromes. Recently, deficiency of the immunoglobulin superfamily member 1 (IGSF 1) has also been demonstrated to cause C-CH. IGSF 1 is a plasma membrane glycoprotein highly expressed in the pituitary. Its physiological role in humans remains unknown. IGSF 1 deficiency causes TSH deficiency, leading to hypothyroidism. In addition, approximately 60 % of patients also suffer a prolactin deficiency.

40|$|Hereditary {{hypothyroidism}} {{caused by}} thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency {{is a rare}} autosomal recessive disease.

In this paper, we describe two related Greek families with three children affected by <b>congenital</b> TSH-deficient <b>hypothyroidism.</b> Sequence analysis of the TSH beta-subunit gene (TSHB) showed that the mutation responsible for the hypothyroidism in these families is a nonsense mutation in exon 2.

40|$|Defective or {{impaired}} thyroglobulin (Tg) synthesis usually {{results in}} <b>congenital</b> goitrous <b>hypothyroidism,</b> virtual absence of Tg in thyroid tissue, {{and the presence}} of an elevated concentration of iodoalbumin. The final result of these abnormalities is a decreased rate of T 3 and T 4 synthesis. We have previously reported two siblings with this syndrome that was attributable to decreased levels of thyroid tissue Tg mRNA, resulting in decreased translation of a fully mature Tg. Further molecular studies in this family are the subject of this report. The Tg mRNA from normal and goitrous thyroid tissue was first reverse transcribed and divided into five overlapping portions from positions 57 - 8448, and the resulting cDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The amplification of nucleotides (nt) 4502 - 5184 from control thyroid tissue Tg mRNA showed a predominant fragment of 683 basepairs (bp) and a minor fragment of 512 bp. This latter fragment contained a 171 -nt deletion that mapped between positions 4567 and 4737 of the Tg mRNA. In contrast, the fragment predominantly present in the congenital goiter was 512 bp. The sequencing of the 683 -bp fragment revealed that the responsible mutation is a cytosine to thymine transition, creating a stop codon at position 1510. This results in loss of a TaqI restriction site. The point mutation is, thus, removed from a portion of the transcripts by the preferential accumulation in the goiter of a 171 -nt-deleted Tg mRNA. The reading frame is maintained and is potentially fully translatable into a Tg polypeptide chain shorter by 57 residues. The presence of the deleted Tg mRNA in normal thyroid tissue, albeit at a low level, strongly suggests that the deleted mRNA sequence corresponds to a complete exon. Our studies suggest that the shorter, alternatively spliced Tg mRNA predominates in the goitrous tissue and probably has a shorter half-life. This would explain the tissue's low Tg mRNA levels, previously reported. Moreover, translation of the mutated transcript would generate a severely truncated Tg polypeptide with limited ability to generate thyroid hormone, resulting in <b>congenital</b> goitrous <b>hypothyroidism.</b> Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.
