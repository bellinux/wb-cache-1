When she set it down before him he swore it smelled like swine's flesh, but knowing where to find the finger, she {{immediately}} turned it up, which fairly convinced him of the contrary. The pie only served to sharpen his appetite, and I heard him sharpening his knife and saying he must have a <b>collop</b> or two, for he was not near satisfied. But what was my terror when I heard the giant groping among the bodies, and, fancying myself, cut the half of my hip off, and took it with him to be roasted. You may be certain I was in great pain, but the fear of being killed prevented me from making any complaint. However, when he had eaten all he began to drink hot liquors in great abundance, so that in a short time he could not hold up his head, but threw himself on a large creel he had made for the purpose, and fell fast asleep. When I heard him snoring, as I was I went up and caused the woman to bind my wound with a handkerchief; and, taking the giant's spit, reddened it in the fire, and ran it through the eye, but was not able to kill him.|$|E

60|$|When {{the nurse}} arrived she turned {{me out of}} the room, on which I went downstairs. I should premise that at breakfast the news that our {{brilliant}} friend was doing well excited universal complacency, and the Princess graciously remarked that he was only to be commiserated for missing the society of Miss <b>Collop.</b> Mrs. Wimbush, whose social gift never shone brighter than in the dry decorum with which she accepted this fizzle in her fireworks, mentioned to me that Guy Walsingham had made a very favourable impression on her Imperial Highness. Indeed I think every one did so, and that, like the money-market or the national honour, her Imperial Highness was constitutionally sensitive. There was a certain gladness, a perceptible bustle in the air, however, which I thought slightly anomalous in a house where a great author lay critically ill. “Le roy est mort—vive le roy”: I was reminded that another great author had already stepped into his shoes. When I came down again after the nurse had taken possession I found a strange gentleman hanging about the hall and pacing to and fro by the closed door of the drawing-room. This personage was florid and bald; he had a big red moustache and wore showy knickerbockers—characteristics all that fitted to my conception of the identity of Dora Forbes. In a moment I saw what had happened: the author of “The Other Way Round” had just alighted at the portals of Prestidge, but had suffered a scruple to restrain him from penetrating further. I recognised his scruple when, pausing to listen at his gesture of caution, I heard a shrill voice lifted in a sort of rhythmic uncanny chant. The famous reading had begun, only it was the author of “Obsessions” who now furnished the sacrifice. The new visitor whispered to me that he judged something was going on he oughtn’t to interrupt.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>collop</b> (cológ) is {{a measure}} of land {{sufficient}} to graze one cow. In Irish tradition, a <b>collop</b> is defined as the amount of land deemed capable of producing enough to support one family, or the number of cattle that the family could rear by pasture on it. It was the basis for the division of common land in the western parts of Ireland in the 18th and early 19th centuries. As in the Rundale system, the <b>collop</b> was scattered over several different fields, so that good and bad land was equally divided. In Eric Cross's The Tailor and Ansty, Timothy [...] "the Tailor" [...] Buckley describes a <b>collop</b> as [...] "an old count for the carrying power of land", noting that it was the grazing of one cow, or two yearling heifers, or six sheep, or twelve goats, or six geese and a gander, while a horse would require three collops. He describes it as a superior method of reckoning land to the acre, noting a man whose holding of 4,000 acres of barren land produces scarcely enough to feed four cattle.|$|E

5000|$|In Elizabethan times, [...] "collops" [...] came {{to refer}} {{specifically}} to slices of bacon. Shrove Monday, {{also known as}} <b>Collop</b> Monday, was traditionally the last day to cook and eat meat before Ash Wednesday, which was a day of fasting and abstinence from meat, and part of pre-Lenten activities. A traditional breakfast dish was collops of bacon topped with a fried egg. At Christ's Hospital, which was founded before the reign of Elizabeth the First, the word collops was used on the menu to mean stewed minced beef.|$|E
50|$|A <b>collop</b> is a {{slice of}} meat, {{according}} to one definition in the Oxford English Dictionary. The derivation is obscure; the OED cites {{that it may be}} related to the old Swedish word kollops (equivalent to the modern: kalops), but also suggests a German origin (klops). The Swedish restaurateur Tore Wretman derives the modern Swedish kalops from the English collops, which in turn is said to originate from Swedish word colhoppe (ember-hops, from how the thin sliced strips of dried salted leg of mutton danced on the glowing hot skillet) that was well established in the Swedish language in the 15th century.|$|E

50|$|William Anderson's {{account is}} similar to that of Shaw's in that he says that John Munro whilst {{returning}} from Edinburgh had the tails of his and his servants' horses cut off while sleeping in a meadow in Strathardle. In revenge John Munro returned home and selected 350 of his best men and returned to Strathardle which he spoiled, killed some of the inhabitants and carried off their cattle. On his return, while passing the castle of Moy the laird of Mackintosh sent a message to him demanding some of the spoil. Anderson goes on to say that this was customary among the Highlanders when a party drove cattle so taken through a gentleman's land, and the part so exacted was called a Staoig Ratliaid or Staoig Crtich that is, a road <b>collop.</b> Munro offered Mackintosh a reasonable share of the booty but Mackintosh would accept no less than half. This Munro refused and drove off the cattle. Shaw states that Mackintosh collected his clansmen and pursued Munro and came up with him at Glach-na-haire (Clachnaharry), near Inverness. Munro perceiving this approach sent fifty of his men home with the cattle and that in the ensuing contest, Mackintosh and the greater part of his men were killed. Several of the Munros were also killed and John Munro himself was left for dead on the field of battle. Lord Lovat had him carried to his house where he was cured of his wounds. One of his hands was so mutilated, that he lost the use of it, on which account he was afterwards culled John Bac-Lniinh, or Ciotach. Anderson states that the Munros had the great advantage of the ground, by taking up a position among rocks, from which they annoyed the Mackintoslies with their arrows".|$|E
