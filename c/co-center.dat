The {{focus is on}} the design and analysis of polynomial-time approximation algorithms. The references on approximation algorithms for inhomogeneous polynomial optimization problems are extremely scarce in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the only result so far was due to Nemirovski, Roos and Terlaky [26], who obtained an Ω (1 / logm) -approximation ratio for maximizing an inhomogeneous quadratic polynomial over the intersection of m <b>co-centered</b> ellipsoids. In this paper we aim at developing computational methods to deal with optimization models with polynomial objective functions in any fixed degrees. In particular, we first study the problem of maximizing an inhomogeneous polynomial over the Euclidean ball. A polynomial-time approximation algorithm is proposed for this problem with an assured (relative) worst-case performance ratio, which is dependent only on the dimensions of the model. The method and approximation ratio are then generalized to optimize an inhomogeneous polynomial over the intersection of a finite number of <b>co-centered</b> ellipsoids. Finally, the constraint set is extended to a general compact set. Specifically, we propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with a (relative) worst-case performance ratio for polynomial optimization over some convex compact sets, e. g., a polytope...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{molecular}} applications, {{virtual reality}} (VR) and immersive virtual environments {{have generally been}} used and valued for the visual and interactive experience – to enhance intuition and communicate excitement – rather than {{as part of the}} actual research process. In contrast, this work develops a software infrastructure for research use and illustrates such use on a specific case. Methods The Syzygy open-source toolkit for VR software was used to write the KinImmerse program, which translates the molecular capabilities of the kinemage graphics format into software for display and manipulation in the DiVE (Duke immersive Virtual Environment) or other VR system. KinImmerse is supported by the flexible display construction and editing features in the KiNG kinemage viewer and it implements new forms of user interaction in the DiVE. Results In addition to molecular visualizations and navigation, KinImmerse provides a set of research tools for manipulation, identification, <b>co-centering</b> of multiple models, free-form 3 D annotation, and output of results. The molecular research test case analyzes the local neighborhood around an individual atom within an ensemble of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) models, enabling immersive visual comparison of the local conformation with the local NMR experimental data, including target curves for residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). Conclusion The promise of KinImmerse for production-level molecular research in the DiVE is shown by the locally <b>co-centered</b> RDC visualization developed there, which gave new insights now being pursued in wider data analysis. </p...|$|R

40|$|An {{original}} {{approach has}} been developed herein to explore the correlations between short- and long-range structural properties of solid solutions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electronic absorption spectroscopy (EAS) data were combined on a (Ca,Sr,Ba) 2 (Mg 0. 7 Co 0. 3) Si 2 O 7 join to determine average and local distances, respectively. Instead of varying the EAS-active ion concentration along the join, as has commonly been performed in previous studies, the constant replacement of Mg 2 + by a minimal fraction of a similar size cation (Co 2 +) {{has been used to}} assess the effects of varying second-nearest neighbor cations (Ca, Sr, Ba) on the local distances of the ﬁrst shell. A comparison between doped and un-doped series has shown that, although the overall symmetry of the <b>Co-centered</b> T 1 -site was retained, greater relaxation occurs at the CoO 4 tetrahedra which become increasingly large and more distorted than the MgO 4 tetrahedra. This is indicated by an increase in both the quadratic elongation (λT 1) and the bond angle variance (s 2 T 1) distortion indices, as the whole structure expands due to an increase in size in the second-nearest neighbors. This behavior highlights the effect of the different electronic conﬁgurations of Co 2 + (3 d 7) and Mg 2 + (2 p 6) in spite of their very similar ionic size. Furthermore, although the overall symmetry of the <b>Co-centered</b> T 1 -site is retained, relatively limited (< 10 deg) angular variations in O–Co 2 +–O occur along the solid solution series and large changes are found in molar absorption coefficients showing that EAS Co 2 +-bands are highly sensitive to change in the local structure...|$|R

It formulates the precoding problem by maximizing the constellation-constrained mutual information between the secondary-user transmitter and secondary-user receiver while controlling the interference power to primary-user receivers. This formulation {{leads to a}} nonlinear and nonconvex problem, presenting a major barrier to obtain optimal solutions. This work proposes a global optimization algorithm, namely Branch-and-bound Aided Mutual Information Optimization (BAMIO), that solves the precoding problem with arbitrary prescribed tolerance. The BAMIO algorithm is designed based on two key observations: First, the precoding problem for spectrum sharing can be reformulated to a problem minimizing a function with bilinear terms over the intersection of multiple <b>co-centered</b> ellipsoids. Second, these bilinear terms can be relaxed by its convex and concave envelopes. In this way, a sequence of relaxed problems is solved over a shrinking feasible region until the tolerance is achieved. The BAMIO algorithm calculates the optimal precoder and the theoretical limit of the transmission rate for spectrum sharing scenarios. By tuning the prescribed tolerance of the solution, it provides a trade-off between desirable performance and computational complexity. Numerical examples show that the BAMIO algorithm offers near global optimal solution with only several iterations.

In [2] it was demonstrated that triangular pulses created using superstructured fibre Bragg grating technology lead to a two-fold improvement in the performance of a wavelength converter based on self-phase modulation in fibre and offset filtering. Recently, we have introduced a method of triangular pulse generation based on the nonlinear reshaping of sufficiently powerful, positively chirped pulses that occurs upon propagation in a normally dispersive fibre (NDF) [1]. In this work, we propose a simple technique for all-optical signal manipulation in the time and frequency domains which utilizes cross-phase modulation (XPM) with a triangular pump pulse and subsequent propagation in a linear dispersive medium.

40|$|Cosmic shear {{has been}} {{identified}} as the method with the most potential to constrain dark energy. To capitalise on this potential it is necessary to measure galaxy shapes with great accuracy, which in turn requires a detailed model for the image blurring, the Point Spread Function (PSF). In general the PSF varies with wavelength and therefore the PSF integrated over an observing filter depends on the spectrum of the object. For a typical galaxy the spectrum varies across the galaxy image, thus the PSF depends on the position within the image. We estimate the bias on the shear due to such colour gradients by modelling galaxies using two <b>co-centered,</b> co-elliptical Sersic profiles, each with a different spectrum. We estimate the effect of ignoring colour gradients and find the shear bias from a single galaxy can be very large depending on the properties of the galaxy. We find that halving the filter width reduces the shear bias by a factor of about 5. We show that, to first order, tomographic cosmic shear two point statistics depend on the mean shear bias over the galaxy population at a given redshift. For a single broad filter, and averaging over a small galaxy catalogue, we find a mean shear bias which is subdominant to the predicted statistical errors for future cosmic shear surveys. However, the true mean shear bias may exceed the statistical errors, depending on how accurately the catalogue represents the observed distribution of galaxies in the cosmic shear survey. We then investigate the bias on the shear for two-filter imaging and find that the bias is reduced by at least an order of magnitude. Lastly, we find {{that it is possible to}} calibrate galaxies for which colour gradients were ignored using two-filter imaging of a fair sample of noisy galaxies, if the galaxy model is known.

The pore volume reduces from 33 % to 30 % by replacing Mn by Co. The material exhibits a diamond framework based on <b>Co-centered</b> CoCo 4 tetrahedral nodes, in which all metal ions have octahedral coordination geometry and all HCOO groups link the metal ions in syn-syn/anti modes. It displays thermal stability up to 270 Â°C. The compound easily loses guest molecules without loss of crystallinity, and it partly reabsorbs water from the atmosphere. Significant N 2 sorption was observed for the desolvated framework suggesting that the material possesses permanent porosity. The magnetic properties show a tendency to a 3 D long-range magnetic ordering, probably antiferromagnetic with a spin canting arrangement below 2 K. Â© 2005 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|The Co 2 + ion in {{fourfold}} coordination provides d-d electronic transitions {{with the}} strongest optical density among oxides and silicates. For this reason, {{it is widely}} used in pigments and dyes to get blue shades detectable down to a very low cobalt concentration. Such a low detection limit turns the Co 2 + ion into a suitable probe to disclose the local ligand environment {{in a wide range}} of materials by means of optical spectroscopy. Even if extensively studied in organometallic complexes, an in-depth investigation of optical properties of Co 2 + in tetrahedral coordination into oxidic structures is limited to some case-study in minerals and synthetic analogues (spinel, zincite, gahnite, willemite, calcium cobalt selenite). The present study represents an attempt to outline crystal structural (long-range metal–oxygen distances, O–T–O bond angles and distortion parameters by XRD) and optical parameters (10 Dq, Racah B and C, band splitting by EAS) in 13 samples of oxides and silicates providing a wide set of different local fourfold coordination around Co 2 + added as a dopant. Subtle variations of crystal field strength and interelectronic repulsion can be appreciated in gahnite, Ca-Sr-hardystonite, Ca-Sr-Ba-åkermanite, willemite, Ba 2 MgSi 2 O 7 melilite-related (where Co 2 + substitutes Mg 2 + or Zn 2 + by 0. 25 - 0. 3 apfu) as well as in gehlenite and fresnoite (where Co 2 + substitutes Al 3 + and Ti 4 +, respectively, by 0. 2 apfu due to charge mismatch). Results are compared with literature data about hibonite, spinel s. s., staurolite, yttrium garnets and zincite. Spectral interpretation is not straightforward owing to the occurrence of different Co 2 + bands: spin-allowed and spin-forbidden electronic transitions, two- or three-fold split due to both lowering of point symmetry at the tetrahedron and spin-orbit coupling plus presumably vibronic transitions. Optical spectra vary significantly even for apparently small changes in the long-range CoO 4 arrangement as measured by XRD. The expected relationship between 10 Dq and the mean Co–O distance is fulfilled, but the accommodation into small AlO 4 sites in gehlenite (YAG and hibonite) implies a significant structural relaxation around the Co 2 + ion. The 3 -fold splitting of the spin-allowed 4 T 1 (F) and 4 T 1 (P) bands can be related to the angular distortion of the CoO 4 tetrahedra. Overall, changes of spectral features of tetrahedrally-coordinated Co 2 + can be attributed to different local arrangement of ligands with an effect correlated to the second nearest neighbors by the Bond Valence theory. This was disclosed contrasting 10 Dq with the ratio of the observed and ideal Bond Valence Sum for the polyhedra sharing oxygen with the <b>Co-centered</b> tetrahedron...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} four {{research papers}} {{in the field of}} condensed-matter theory. Three of the papers make use of large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations to explore various aspects of Bose-Einstein condensates with multiple superfluid components. Papers I and II relate to a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate in three spatial dimensions under rotation. They explore the phase diagram and phase transitions of the model in two regimes, where either inter- or intra-component interactions dominates, as well as at a special SU(2) -symmetric point where all density-density interactions are of equal strength. We find that this rich phase diagram, in the coexisting regime, exhibits <b>co-centered</b> vortex lattices with hexagonal symmetry when the inter-component interaction is attractive. These lattices evolve into intercalated hexagonal lattices as the inter-component interaction is made repulsive, and further into intercalated square lattices as the repulsive interaction is increased in strength. In the phase-separated regime, we find striped vortex lattices for intermediate inter-component coupling strengths. For sufficiently strong inter-component coupling strengths one of the condensates is completely depleted, while the other develops a hexagonal vortex line lattice, as it is effectively a single-component condensate. Paper III investigates the phases and phase transitions of a similar model of a two-component condensate, now in two spatial dimensions with spin-orbit coupling and zero rotation. Here we find, for low inter-component coupling strength, that the effect of the spin-orbit interaction is to modulate the condensate fields by a single q-vector, a plane wave state. For increased inter-component couplings, but with intermediate spin-orbit coupling, we again find that one of the condensates will be depleted, making the remaining condensate effectively a single-component condensate. This completely removes the effect of the spin-orbit interaction. For both high inter-component and high spin-orbit interaction strengths, we find that the condensate forgoes the energy gained by depleting one condensate. It will rather modulate the condensate, but now with staggered condensate amplitudes. This state is a superposition of two states with modulation vectors q and - q, a standing wave state. We also explore the thermal phase transitions in the absence of spin-orbit couplings, here we find Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in all components {{regardless of whether or not}} one component has collapsed, and independent on the value of the inter-component density-density interaction strength. The last paper explores, in a purely analytical treatment, the effect of inter-band Josephson couplings on an N-component London superconductor. It utilizes a mathematical identity to re-express the model in terms of integer-valued superconducting currents, and we show that the inclusion of inter-band couplings introduces instanton-like events in these currents. These events effectively removes the current conservation in each individual superconducting current, as is expected when introducing the Josephson coupling. However, one particular combination of current, the sum of all the currents, remains conserved even with the Josepshon coupling. We argue that this converts the phase transitions of the neutral sector into crossovers, while leaving the charged phase transition unaffected. The fluctuations of the neutral sector will weaken, but may still influence the charged fluctuations sufficiently to preempt the remaining inverted- 3 DXY transition, making it first order. We also re-express the onset of the Higgs mass when entering the superconducting state as a blowout of loops of superconducting current...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{critical}} properties of three-dimensional U(1) -symmetric lattice gauge theories. The models apply to various physical systems such as insulating phases of strongly correlated electron systems as well as superconducting and superfluid states of liquid metallic hydrogen under extreme pressures. This thesis contains an introductory part {{and a collection of}} research papers of which seven are published works and one is submitted for publication. Paper I: Critical properties of the 2 + 1 -dimensional compact abelian Higgs model with gauge charge q= 2 are studied. We introduce a novel method of computing the third moment M 3 of the action which allows us to extract correlation length and specific heat critical exponents ν and α without invoking hyperscaling. Finite-size scaling analysis of M 3 yields the ratio (1 +α) /ν and 1 /ν separately. We find that α and ν vary along the critical line of the theory, which however exhibits a remarkable resilience of Z 2 criticality. We conclude that the model is a fixed-line theory, which we propose to characterize the zero temperature quantum phase transition from a Mott-Hubbard insulator to a charge fractionalized insulator in two spatial dimensions. Paper II: Large scale Monte Carlo simulations are employed to study phase transitions in the three-dimensional compact abelian Higgs model in adjoint representations of the matter field, labeled by an integer q, for q= 2, 3, 4, 5. We also study various limiting cases of the model, such as the Z q lattice gauge theory, dual to the 3 DZ q spin model, and the 3 D xy spin model which is dual to the Z q lattice gauge theory in the limit q → ∞. In addition, for benchmark purposes, we study the 2 D square lattice 8 -vertex model, which is exactly solvable and features non-universal critical exponents. The critical exponents α and ν are calculated from finite size scaling of the third moment of the action, and the method is tested thoroughly on models with known values for these exponents. We have found that for q= 3, the three-dimensional compact abelian Higgs model exhibits a second order phase transition line which joins a first order phase transition line at a tricritical point. The results for q= 2 in Paper I are reported with a higher lever of detail. Paper III: This paper is based on a talk by F. S. Nogueira in the Aachen HEP 2003 conference where a review of the results for the compact abelian Higgs model from Paper I and Paper II was presented, as well as the results for the q= 1 case studied by F. S. Nogueira, H. Kleinert and A. Sudbø. Paper IV: We study the effects of a Chern-Simons (CS) term in the phase structure of two different abelian gauge theories in three dimensions. By duality transformations we show how the compact U(1) gauge theory with a CS term for certain values of the CS coupling can be written as a gas of vortex loops interacting through steric repulsion. This theory is known to exhibit a phase transition governed by proliferation of vortex loops. We also employ Monte Carlo simulations to study the non-compact U(1) abelian Higgs model with a CS term. Finite size scaling of the third moment of the action yields critical exponents α and ν that vary continuously with the strength of the CS term, and a comparison with available analytical results is made. Paper V: The critical properties of N-component Ginzburg-Landau theory are studied in d= 2 + 1 dimensions. The model is dualized to a theory of N vortex fields interacting through a Coulomb and a screened potential. The model with N= 2 shows two anomalies in the specific heat. From Monte Carlo simulations we calculate the critical exponents α and ν and the mass of the gauge field. We conclude that one anomaly corresponds to an inverted 3 D xy fixed point, while the other corresponds to a 3 D xy fixed point. There are N fixed points, namely one corresponding to an inverted 3 D xy fixed point, and N- 1 corresponding to neutral 3 D xy fixed points. Applications are briefly discussed. Paper VI: The phase diagram and critical properties of the N-component London superconductor are studied both analytically and through large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations in d= 2 + 1 dimensions. The model with different bare phase stiffnesses for each flavor is a model of superconductivity which should arise out of metallic phases of light atoms under extreme pressure. A projected mixture of electronic and protonic condensates in liquid metallic hydrogen under extreme pressure is the simplest example, corresponding to N= 2 with individually conserved matter fields. We compute critical exponents α and ν for N= 2 and N= 3. The results from Paper V are presented at a higher level of detail. For the arbitrary N case, there are N fixed points,namely one charged inverted 3 D xy fixed point, and N- 1 neutral 3 D xy fixed points. We explicitly identify one charged vortex mode and N- 1 neutral vortex modes. The model for N= 2 and equal bare phase stiffnesses corresponds to a field theoretical description of an easy-plane quantum antiferromagnet. In this case, the critical exponents are computed and found to be non 3 D xy values. Furthermore, we study the model in an external magnetic field, and find a novel feature, namely N- 1 superfluid phases arising out of N charged condensates. In particular, for N= 2 we point out the possibility of two novel types of field-induced phase transitions in ordered quantum fluids: i) A phase transition from a superconductor to a superfluid or vice versa, driven by tuning an external magnetic field. This identifies the superconducting phase of liquid metallic hydrogen as a novel quantum fluid. ii) A phase transition corresponding to a quantum fluid analogue of sublattice melting, where a composite field-induced Abrikosov vortex lattice is decomposed and disorders the phases of the constituent condensate with lowest bare phase stiffness. Both transitions belong to the 3 D xy universality class. Paper VII: We consider the vortex superconductor with two individually conserved condensates in a finite magnetic field. The ground state is a lattice of cocentered vortices in both order parameters. We find two novel phase transitions when temperature is increased at fixed magnetic field. i) A "vortex sublattice melting" transition where vortices in the field with lowest phase stiffness ("light vortices") loose cocentricity with the vortices with large phase stiffness ("heavy vortices"), entering a liquid state (the structure factor of the light vortex sublattice vanishes continuously.) This transition is in the 3 D xy universality class. ii) A first order melting transition of the lattice of heavy vortices in a liquid of light vortices. Paper VIII: We report on large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of a novel type of a vortex matter phase transition which should take place in a three dimensional two-component superconductor. We identify the regime where first, at a certain temperature a field-induced lattice of <b>co-centered</b> vortices of both order parameters melts, causing the system to loose superconductivity. In this state the two-gap system retains a broken composite symmetry and we observe that at a higher temperature it undergoes an extra phase transition where the disordered composite one-flux-quantum vortex lines are "ionized" into a "plasma" of constituent fractional flux vortex lines in individual order parameters. This is the hallmark of the superconductor-to-superfluid-to-normal fluid phase transitions projected to occur in e. g. liquid metallic hydrogen. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
