40|$|Organoboron {{reagents}} {{have been}} synonymous with organic chemistry for {{over half a}} century and continue to see widespread application today; for example, classic reactions such as hydroboration and Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling are regularly practiced throughout the chemical community. In particular, applications of organoboron compounds have underpinned pharmaceutical and agrochemical development on both discovery and process scales for decades. Although {{it is noteworthy that}} these seminal reactions have stood the test of time, continually increasing pressure to improve efficiency in <b>chemical</b> <b>synthesis</b> <b>demands</b> innovation. Over the past few years, through an explosion in the number of new methods for the installation and manipulation of organoboron functional groups, as well as the understanding of their mechanistic operation, organoboron chemistry has risen to this challenge...|$|R

These methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology, though generally not for commercial applications. <b>Chemical</b> <b>synthesis</b> is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about 300 amino acids, and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure.
