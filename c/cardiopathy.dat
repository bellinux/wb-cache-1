40|$|First considerations: {{in spite}} of {{technological}} progresse in diagnosis, treatment and surgical techniques, which allowed today a larger survival and better life for children bearer of congenital cardiopatias, the growth and development deficits continues {{being one of the}} most common problems in those children. Objective: to assess the growth and development of children in the presence of congenital cardiopathie. Methods: this is an exploratory, descriptive, and field study using a quantitative approach. The sample was comprised of 14 children between the ages of three and twenty-four months with congenital <b>cardiopathies.</b> For the growth assessment, the Z score of weight-for-age and height-for-age were determined. For the developmental assessment, the Denver II was used. Results: the children presented a height and weight deficit of 42. 85 %, evidence by the Z score of weight-for-age and height-for-age less than or equal to - 2. The congenital <b>cardiopathies</b> that most affected growth were interventricular communication and tetralogy of Fallot. As for development of these children, the study detected a suspected developmental delay in the personal-social (14, 29 %), language (14, 29 %) and motor (64, 29 %) areas. Conclusions: the results point up the importance of monitoring the growth and development of children with congenital <b>cardiopathies</b> by healthcare professionals, with the aim of minimizing the effects of these pathologies on nutritional states, a risk factor for worsening the health of these children. Parents must be advised about the importance of meeting these children’s needs and establishing measures to reduce the negative impacts of <b>cardiopathies</b> on their children’s growth and development...|$|R

40|$|Non-syndromic cardiac {{septation}} defects are common, yet the causative factors {{remain largely}} uncharacterised. Septation defects {{are an integral}} part of many syndromes, some of which are associated with chromosomal alterations. For the majority, the physiopathogenesis is believed to be multi-factorial, hindering the identification of causative factors. Ten mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor CSX/NKX 2 - 5 have been described in individuals with ASD and/or atrioventricular conduction defects. In addition, several other cardiac abnormalities were observed, yet the mildest forms are reminiscent of non-syndromic septation defects. The CSX/NKX 2 - 5 gene is thus a good candidate for various <b>cardiopathies.</b> We have collected two families with inherited predisposition to cardiac abnormalities. Some members of the families presented ASD and AV block. In both families a novel CSX/NKX 2 - 5 mutation was identified in the homeodomain. Variable expressivity in the phenotype was observed in both families. Importantly, mutation carriers did not present any symptoms at young age. In addition, anomalous venous return, a phenotype not previously associated to CSX/NKX 2 - 5 mutations, was observed in one of the families. We also screened the CSX/NKX 2 - 5 gene in sporadic and familial cases of other <b>cardiopathies.</b> As additional mutations were not found, substitutions in CSX/NKX 2 - 5 gene seem to be a rare cause of <b>cardiopathies</b> without conduction defect. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesTransesophageal {{echocardiography}} (TEE) {{is extremely}} useful in surgeries like valvuloplasty, of the thoracic aorta, and correction of congenital <b>cardiopathies.</b> The low degree of invasiveness {{and the capacity}} to aggregate information that can change the course of the surgery are among the advantages of TEE. The objective of this report was to present a case in which the surgical conduct was changed due to a new diagnosis provided by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography, and to emphasize the importance of using the transesophageal echo in surgeries to correct congenital <b>cardiopathies.</b> Case reportA 28 -year old female, ASA II, with a history of dyspnea progressing from medium to small efforts was referred by another department for elective surgical correction of stenosis of the pulmonary valve diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography showed patent foramen ovale, infundibular stenosis of the right ventricular outlet, and perimembranous subaortic interventricular communication (IVC) of 0. 4 cm with left to right shunt. After beginning ECC, the above mentioned diagnoses were confirmed and the surgery included closure of the foramen ovale and IVC, and resection of the infundibular stenosis. Intraoperative intercurrences were not observed and the patient was intubated when she was transferred to the intensive care unit. ConclusionsTransesophageal echocardiography is extremely useful in patients undergoing surgical correction of congenital <b>cardiopathies</b> because, besides helping the hemodynamic management, it can provide new information capable of improving the final result of the surgery...|$|R

Most carriers of this McLeod blood group phenotype have acanthocytosis and elevated serum creatine kinase levels and are prone to develop a severe neurological disorder resembling Huntington's disease. Onset of neurological symptoms ranges between 25 and 60 years, and the penetrance of the disorder appears to be high. Additional symptoms of the McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome that warrant therapeutic and diagnostic considerations include generalized seizures, neuromuscular symptoms leading to weakness and atrophy, and <b>cardiopathy</b> mainly manifesting with atrial fibrillation, malignant arrhythmias and dilated cardiomyopathy.|$|E

50|$|Unless one of {{the parents}} is a carrier of a translocation, {{the chances of a}} couple having another trisomy 13 {{affected}} child is less than 1% (less than that of Down syndrome). The most common characteristics of this syndrome are problems such as late development, mental disability, multiple malformations, <b>cardiopathy,</b> and kidney abnormalities. The most common physical signs for Patau Syndrome are the decreasing of muscle tone, small hands, small ears, small head and mouth, as well as wide and short hands with short fingers. Physical development for children affected by Patau Syndrome occurs more slowly than children without Patau syndrome. However, children affected by Patau Syndrome should still undergo regular physical activity, even though muscle development may occur more slowly.|$|E
40|$|Background. We {{present a}} study of {{collection}} of mouse fetuses of the iv/iv strain between days 16. 5 and 18. 5 of gestation. Methods and Results. One hundred hearts were serially sectioned and studied by segmental analysis with a light microscope. Forty additional hearts were analyzed with a scanning microscope. Forty percent of the hearts {{were found to be}} malformed. The most frequently occurring heart malformations were persistence of the sinus venosus (9 %), common atrium (17 %), common atrioventricular canal (24 %), double-outlet right ventricle (12 %), Fallot's tetralogy (8 %), and transposition of the great arteries (5 %). These malformations do not usually occur in isolation but rather appear in the formation of complex <b>cardiopathies.</b> The most severe and frequent is the combination of persistence of sinus venosus, common atrium, common atrioventricular canal, and double-outlet right ventricle; this is the "bulboventricular heart. " The morphology of each lesion, as well as the degree of association, is similar to that found in human hearts with complex <b>cardiopathies.</b> Some of these <b>cardiopathies</b> appear to be directly related to formation of the cardiac loop. The iv/iv mouse appears to constitute an excellent model with which to study the etiology and pathogenesis of complex heart defects in humans. These hearts show a high phenotypic variability in the presentation of heart lesions. From a genetic viewpoint, there is a basic defect- the bulboventricular heart- which can be considered congenital. The other malformations can be considered formes frustes of the defect type. Conclusions. The iv gene is a developmental gene that affects basic developmental mecha-nisms. In this regard, heart lesions may not be the primary result of the abnormal gene activity but rather are secondary to defective interactions during cardiac development. (Circulatio...|$|R

40|$|Diabetes Mellitus has {{developed}} into a widespread disease with increasing prevalence in industrialised countries, accompanied by increased morbidity and mortality rates. Diabetic <b>cardiopathy</b> is of particular significance among Diabetes Mellitus related diseases. The aim of the present work was {{the investigation of the}} effects of an HDL-C increase on diabetic <b>cardiopathy.</b> For the induction of diabetic <b>cardiopathy</b> the well-examined STZ rat animal experimental model served, which imitates the metabolic disorders of Diabetes Mellitus Type I. For the increase in HDL-C levels, a newly developed E 1 E 3 E 4 -deleted adenoviral vector was used, which carries the human ApoAI gene in the expression cassette. The possibility was thereby created to selectively increase the concentration of ApoAI, the main component of HDL-C, and thus to multiply the HDL-C concentration by 1. 6 during a 6 -week period. The increased HDL-C concentrations in the present study led to a reduction of diabetic <b>cardiopathy.</b> This was reflected in an improvement of left ventricular haemodynamics, with an increase in contraction and relaxation ability. The causes for this are multifactorially conditioned, with the different paths existing in a complex interrelationship. The result was therefore a reduction of the total collagen content, cardiac inflammation, oxidative stress, {{as well as of the}} cellular structures after hApoAI gene transfer...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to verify the degree and type of heart damage of elderly chagasic patients seen at an outpatient referral center and to compare them with the changes found in young chagasic patients with a similar degree of heart damage. Elderly and young patients without advanced <b>cardiopathy</b> presented good functional behavior. Elderly patients with advanced <b>cardiopathy</b> had more ventricular premature beats (VPB) in 24 h and less functional capacity in the exercise test than young patients of the same subgroup. There was a higher occurrence of effort-induced VPB and a lower prevalence of severe forms in elderly men, suggesting that Chagas' disease may have a worse evolution in males. The association of cardiac damage characteristic of aging with the secondary damage due to Chagas' disease could explain the greater functional damage found in elderly chagasic patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{access the}} {{incidence}} of diagnostic errors in the initial evaluation of children with cardiac murmurs. METHODS: We evaluated our 7 -years of experience in a public pediatric cardiology outpatient clinic. Of 3692 patients who {{were sent to the}} hospital, 2603 presented with a heart murmur and were investigated. Patients for whom a disagreement existed between the initial and final diagnoses were divided into the following 2 groups: G 1 (n= 17) with an initial diagnosis of an innocent murmur and a final diagnosis of <b>cardiopathy,</b> and G 2 (n= 161) with an initial diagnosis of <b>cardiopathy</b> and a final diagnosis of a normal heart. RESULTS: In G 1, the great majority of patients had cardiac defects with mild hemodynamic repercussions, such as small ventricular septal defect and mild pulmonary stenosis. In G 2, the great majority of structural defects were interventricular communication, atrial septal defect and pulmonary valve stenosis. CONCLUSION: A global analysis demonstrated that diagnostic error in the initial evaluation of children with cardiac murmurs is real, reaching approximately 6 % of cases. The majority of these misdiagnoses were in patients with an initial diagnosis of <b>cardiopathy,</b> which was not confirmed through later complementary examinations. Clinical cardiovascular examination is an excellent resource in the evaluation of children suspected of having <b>cardiopathy.</b> Immediate outpatient discharge of children with an initial diagnosis of an innocent heart murmur seems to be a suitable approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of chronic}} chagasic <b>cardiopathy</b> {{is still a}} debated matter. In this review, the main theories raised about it since the first description of the disease in 1909 by Carlos Chagas, are considered. The scarcity of T. cruzi parasites into the myocardium and the apparent lack of correlation between their presence and the occurrence of myocardial inflammatory infiltrate, have originated many theories indicating that chronic Chagas' <b>cardiopathy</b> is an autoimmune disease. Recently however, papers using immunohistochemical technique or PCR have demonstrated a strong association between moderate or severe myocarditis and presence of T. cruzi Ags, indicating a direct participation of the parasite in the genesis of chronic chagasic myocarditis. Different patterns of cytokine production seem to have {{important role in the}} outcome of the disease. Participation of the microcirculatory alterations and fibrosis as well as the relationship with the parasite are also emphasized. Finally, the author suggests that the indeterminate form of the disease occurs when the host immunological response against the parasite is more efficient while the chronic <b>cardiopathy</b> occurs in patients with hyperergic and inefficient immune respons...|$|E

40|$|Rules are {{presented}} for {{the diagnosis of}} arterioventricular discordances and the spatial position of the ventricles in these <b>cardiopathies</b> by means of angiocardiography and the position of cardiac catheters. Because these rules are based on previous anatomo-embryological findings, the normal development of the conus and the truncus is briefly analysed. The probable morphogenesis of this group of truncoconal <b>cardiopathies</b> is discussed. The fundamental process required to establish the diagnosis of these <b>cardiopathies</b> is as follows: 1) The truncoconal morphology is identified in the lateral projection. a) The anterior position of the pulmonary artery and its infundibulum {{with respect to the}} aorta and its infundibulum is characteristic of crossed great arteries with arterioventricular concordance or discordance. b) The anterior position of the aorta and its infundibulum with respect to the pulmonary artery and its infundibulum is characteristic of transposition of the great arteries with arterioventricular concordance or discordance. 2) Once the truncoconal morphology is identified, the use of the anteroposterior projection allows the establishment of the differential diagnosis between arterioventricular concordances and discordances, and of the spatial location of the ventricles in these entities. a) An anterior pulmonary artery directed from right to left, emerging from an infundibulum placed on the left side (anatomically right ventricle on the left) or an anterior pulmonary artery directed from left to right, arising from an infundibulum located to the right (anatomically right ventricular placed on the right), is the specific image of discordant crossed great arteries. b) An anterior pulmonary artery directed from right to left emerging from an infundibulum placed on the right side (anatomically right ventricle on the right side) or the anterior pulmonary artery directed from left to right arising from a left-sided infundibulum (anatomically right ventricle placed on the left side) is characteristic of concordant crossed great arteries. c) An anterior aorta placed {{to the right of the}} pulmonary artery and emerging from a left-sided infundibulum (anatomically right ventricle placed on the left side) or an anterior aorta placed to the left of the pulmonary artery and arising from an infundibulum placed on the right side (anatomically right ventricle placed on the right) is characteristic of discordant transposition of the great arteries. d) An anterior aorta placed to the right of the pulmonary artery emerging from a right-sided infundibulum (anatomically right ventricle placed on the right) or an anterior aorta placed to the left of the pulmonary artery arising from an infundibulum placed on the left (anatomically right ventricle placed on the left) is the specific picture of concordant transposition of the great arteries [...] ...|$|R
