5|$|Icos {{is famous}} for tadalafil (Cialis), a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction. This drug was {{discovered}} by GlaxoSmithKline, developed by Icos, and manufactured and marketed in partnership with Eli Lilly. Boosted by a unique advertising campaign led by the Grey Worldwide Agency, sales from Cialis allowed Icos to become profitable in 2006. Cialis was the only drug developed by the company to be approved. LeukArrest, a drug to treat shock, and Pafase, developed for sepsis, were both tested in phaseIII clinical trials, but testing was discontinued after unpromising results during the trials. Eli Lilly acquired Icos in January 2007, and most of Icos's workers were laid off soon after. CMC Biologics, a Danish <b>contract</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> bought the remnants of Icos and retained the remaining employees.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} vehicles, the Finnish motor {{industry}} consists mostly of manufacturers of tractors (Valtra, formerly Valmet tractor), forest machines (f.ex. Ponsse), military vehicles (Sisu, Patria), trucks (Sisu Auto), buses and Valmet Automotive, a <b>contract</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> whose factory in Uusikaupunki produces Fisker electric cars. Shipbuilding {{is an important}} industry: the world's largest cruise ships are built in Finland; also, the Finnish company Wärtsilä produces the world's largest diesel engines. In addition, Finland also produces train rolling stock.|$|E

40|$|<b>Contract</b> <b>manufacturers</b> always {{complain}} {{the accuracy}} of forecasts given by brand customers. This fact induces manufacturers’ burden on preparing extra materials and reserving extra capacities. To ensure profits, <b>contract</b> <b>manufacturers</b> have to add extra number on quotations. It makes the relations between brand customers and <b>contract</b> <b>manufacturers</b> even more brittle. Therefore, well-organized communication, such as constructing a collaborative forecasting and production planning system, {{is the key to}} link both parties tightly. In practice, providing a clear definition of production models to guide customers during placing orders is needed. In this paper, the concept of “product definition triangle” is introduced as the heart of order-planning model. This paper provides some ideas about how to increase {{the accuracy of}} forecasts, lower the inventory level, and improve the effective capacity usage, by using the order-planning model. The concept provided by this paper can eliminate the contradiction between brand customers and <b>contract</b> <b>manufacturers</b> effectively...|$|R
25|$|Approximately 400 {{developer}} boards (Alpha-1) {{were distributed}} in mid-2006; 875 working prototypes (Beta 1) were delivered in late 2006; 2400 Beta-2 machines were distributed {{at the end}} of February 2007; full-scale production started November 6, 2007. Quanta Computer, the project's <b>contract</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> said in February 2007 that it had confirmed orders for one million units. Quanta indicated that it could ship five million to ten million units that year because seven nations had committed to buy the XO-1 for their schoolchildren: Argentina, Brazil, Libya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Thailand, and Uruguay. Quanta plans to offer machines very similar to the XO-1 on the open market.|$|E
500|$|As of February 2014, Doxil was {{available}} in limited supply. In 2011, Doxil became available only in very limited supply due to production problems with the third-party manufacturer.

50|$|Threshold {{relies on}} {{third-party}} <b>contract</b> <b>manufacturers</b> for {{the manufacture of}} evofosfamide to meet its and Merck KGaA’s clinical supply needs. Any inability of the third-party <b>contract</b> <b>manufacturers</b> to produce adequate quantities could adversely affect the clinical development and commercialization of evofosfamide. Furthermore, Threshold has no long-term supply agreements {{with any of these}} <b>contract</b> <b>manufacturers</b> and additional agreements for more supplies of evofosfamide will be needed to complete the clinical development and/or commercialize it. In this regard, Merck KGaA has to enter into agreements for additional supplies or develop such capability itself. The clinical programs and the potential commercialization of evofosfamide could be delayed if Merck KGaA is unable to secure the supply.|$|R

We hypothesize that lead firms capture more value from innovation (R&D), compared to <b>contract</b> <b>manufacturers</b> and component suppliers, because they are positioned close to customers in the global value chain and build capabilities complementary to R&D by focusing on product design, brand, and sales and marketing...|$|R

As an illustrative case we trace the evolution of the largest electronics <b>contract</b> <b>manufacturers</b> based in the United States and Taiwan, and discuss several trends which may be pushing Taiwan and North American <b>contract</b> <b>manufacturers</b> closer together in terms of competition and geographic location...|$|R

40|$|Global Manufacturing Virtual Networks (GMVNs) are {{dynamically}} changing organizations formed by Original Equipment <b>Manufacturers</b> (OEMs), <b>Contract</b> <b>Manufacturers</b> (CMs), turn-key and component suppliers, R+D centres and distributors.
