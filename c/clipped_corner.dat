50|$|For the Olivetti-Underwood Factory (1966-1970) in Harrisburg, PA, the Olivetti company, a firm {{noted for}} its {{commitment}} to good design, hired Louis Kahn to design its factory building.Komendant engineered the building's structure, which consists of 72 prestressed concrete units locked together in an 8x9 grid to form the building's roof and roof support system. Each of these units is a prismatic concrete shell that looks something like a square dish with <b>clipped</b> <b>corners</b> perched {{on top of a}} relatively thin concrete column. Each shell is 30 ft above the factory floor and 60 ft across, covering 3600 sq ft of roof.|$|R

The top of the tower is a flat roof, and supports an open-air VRB-25 marine beacon.|$|R

[...] The William D. Alexander House was designated to the Provo Historic Landmark registry on March 7, 1996.|$|R
50|$|Lower {{denomination}} notes- 10, 25, and 50 kopeck {{notes were}} the same size (except for the one-issue round 10 kopeck note).

50|$|The Olivetti-Underwood Factory {{consists}} of 72 prestressed concrete units locked {{together in an}} 8x9 grid that is clearly visible in this aerial image on Google Maps. Each unit looks something like a square dish with <b>clipped</b> <b>corners</b> perched {{on top of a}} relatively thin concrete column. More precisely, the dish is a prismatic concrete shell 6 inches (15 cm) thick, 30 feet (9 m) above the factory floor and 60 feet (18 m) across, covering 3600 square feet (334 m²) of roof. Rain water drains from the roof down a pipe {{in the center of the}} column. Because the outer four corners of each unit are clipped, a void is left at the place where four units meet that allows natural light to reach the factory floor through a translucent skylight.|$|R

5000|$|The {{building}} is constructed of Douglas Fir framing on twelve-inch (305 mm) centers holding smooth redwood plank {{tongue and groove}} siding with redwood sleepers, ground sills and redwood exterior ornamental features. It is founded on plastered brick which surrounds the dirt floor basement and forms a pedestal to support {{the rest of the}} framing. Metal trim around the chimneys augments the wood shingle roof ("best-quality of heart redwood" [...] shingles with <b>clipped</b> <b>corners</b> were originally specified.) Gable-ended dormers extend through the steep roofline; decorated barge-boards and heavily-molded finials, corbels and string corners adorn the dormers and roof eaves. A strong sense of verticality is enhance by tall, narrow windows and the steeply-angled 52.5° roof. The original main chimney vented flues from four fireplaces and rose in a slender pillar twelve feet above the roof at the symmetrical center of the building. Two other chimneys were of similar design. (By 1928, the tall, slender, cylindrical chimneys had been replaced by unremarkable short, rectangular brick ones.) ...|$|R

2500|$|Amer Ajami of GameSpot {{said that}} the PlayStation 2 version [...] "suffers {{from a number of}} problems, {{not the least of which}} is bad {{collision}} detection.

[...] Ajami was also disappointed with the extremely slippery and overly sensitive control. Ajami added, however, that fans of the show should enjoy the game.|$|R
50|$|As {{tapes and}} CDs supplanted LPs, the {{mechanisms}} for indicating a cut-out changed. On cassettes, a hole {{tended to be}} punched or burned through the case and through its printed insert.
