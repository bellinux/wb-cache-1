30|$|Recently, various {{nanosized}} semiconductors including CdS[7], CdSe[8], CuInS 2 [9], Sb 2 S 3 [10, 11], PbS[12], {{as well as}} III-VI quantum ring[13, 14] {{have been}} studied for solar cell applications. Among these nanomaterials, lead sulfide (PbS) has shown much promise as an impressive sensitizer due to its reasonable bandgap of about 0.8 eV in the bulk material, which <b>can</b> <b>allow</b> extension of <b>the</b> <b>absorption</b> band toward <b>the</b> near infrared (NIR) part of the solar spectrum. Recently, Sambur et al. experimentally demonstrated the collection of photocurrents with quantum yields greater than one electron per photon in the PbS QD-sensitized planar TiO 2 single crystal utilizing polysulfide electrolyte, which is undoubtedly encouraging to the future photovoltaic development[15]. Furthermore, PbS has a large exciton Bohr radius of about 20 nm, {{which can lead to}} extensive quantum size effects. It has been reported that its absorption range can be tuned by adjusting the particle size of the quantum dots[16, 17]. Until now, {{as one of the most}} impressive alternative semiconductors, PbS-sensitized solar cells have been studied by many groups[18 – 22]. In most of the reported works, PbS quantum dots were grown on TiO 2 nanotubes[20], ZnO nanorod arrays[21], and TiO 2 photoanode with hierarchical pore distribution[22]. Little work has been carried out on large-area single-crystalline TiO 2 nanorod array photoanode. Compared to the polycrystal TiO 2 nanostructures such as nanotubes[23] and nanoparticles[24], single-crystalline TiO 2 nanorods grown directly on transparent conductive oxide electrodes provide a perfect solution by avoiding the particle-to-particle hopping that occurs in polycrystalline films, thereby increasing the photocurrent efficiency. In addition to the potential of improving electron transport, they enhance light harvesting by scattering the incident light.|$|R
