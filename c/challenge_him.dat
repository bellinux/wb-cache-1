5|$|Maloney {{is running}} for {{re-election}} in 2016. Fellow Democrat Diana Hird announced her intention to <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> in the primary election on June 28, 2016, but failed to obtain the necessary number of signatures and file a petition {{to get on the}} ballot in time.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to settle in France, he moved to Britain {{and then to the}} capital of present-day Belgium, Brussels, where he settled. He {{intended}} to live there until Mercedes completed her education and then return to Argentina. Rivadavia visited Brussels and San Martín intended to <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> to a duel, but was dissuaded by Diego Paroissien.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E

5|$|Baroš {{failed to}} score {{at the start}} of the 2006–07 season, leading new manager Martin O'Neill to <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> in October to prove himself before the January {{transfer}} window. He subsequently scored his first goal of the season in December 2006, eight months since scoring his last one, with a close-range equaliser against Sheffield United in a 2–2 draw. Although he also managed to score for Aston Villa in a 2–1 loss to Manchester United in the FA Cup, he left the club in January 2007, having scored just once in 17 league matches that season.|$|E
5|$|Lucien Petit-Breton {{became the}} new leader of the race. Although he had already {{finished}} in fifth place and fourth place in previous years, he was still relatively unknown, and had started in the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées category. Petit-Breton {{finished in the top}} three in the next stages, so no other cyclist was able to <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> for the overall victory. At the end of the race, he had increased his lead to a margin of 19 points ahead of Garrigou and 27 points ahead of Georget.|$|E
5|$|Several weeks later, Jimson {{is fired}} {{from his job}} for {{slapping}} his manager and is deported back to India. The following day, Mahesh and Baby <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> to a hand-to-hand combat. After {{a few minutes of}} fighting, Mahesh pins down Jimson and Baby declares him the winner. Mahesh visits Jimson in a hospital on the next day and introduces himself to his mother in front of Jimsy. He admits his love for Jimsy and asks Jimson for his sister's hand in marriage, as Jimson and his mother look at each other in disbelief. In the credits, Mahesh is seen joining with Jimsy.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He considered himself to be attractive to women, partly because of his position of power. Hitler's friend Albert Speer recalled him stating a preference for unintelligent women who would not <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> about his work or prevent him from relaxing in his leisure time. Kershaw speculates that Hitler preferred younger women who were easy to dominate and mould. He notes that {{at least three of}} Hitler's close female associates (Eva Braun, Geli Raubal, and Maria Reiter) were far younger than himself: Braun was 23 years younger, Raubal was 19 years younger, and Reiter was 21 years his junior.|$|E
5|$|Nelson Piquet Jr. won {{the pole}} {{position}} by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and maintained his startline advantage {{on the first}} lap. He {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field and held first place until he collided with a barrier after swerving to avoid José María López's crashed car on the 17th lap allowing Sam Bird to move into the lead. Some drivers elected to make pit stops to switch to their second cars with Bird choosing to remain on the circuit until his own stop eight laps later. He had technical problems with his second car and Buemi inherited the first position. Di Grassi was no more than two seconds behind Buemi but was unable to get close enough to <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> because he had to conserve electrical energy usage and Buemi remained the leader for the rest of the race to win. There were three lead changes among four different drivers during the course of the race.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{office in}} January 1906, Barkley saved taxpayers over $35,000 by {{challenging}} improper charges to the county. He prosecuted two magistrates for approving contracts {{in which they}} had a conflict of interest. Even Republicans admitted that he performed well, and he was chosen president of the State Association of County Attorneys. During the 1907 gubernatorial election, he was the Democratic county spokesman, and despite his previous support for the Gold Democrats, he backed William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 presidential election. Friends encouraged him to run for county judge, a powerful position which controlled county funds and patronage, and he announced his candidacy on August 22, 1908. After the chairman of the county's Democratic Club Executive Committee endorsed him, the incumbent judge, Richard T. Lightfoot, retired rather than <b>challenge</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{calls of}} {{throwing}} so infuriated Marsh {{that at the}} end of the day's play, he announced that he would wear splints when he was bowling the next day. Marsh took this action to ensure that his elbow was kept straight and to demonstrate that he could bowl fast without throwing. Marsh had previously performed such an exhibition to ground members and the requisite splints and bandages were acquired from the nearby St. Vincent's Hospital, in order to bind his bowling arm. The hospital provided a medical certificate stating that Marsh could not move his elbow while encased in the splints. Marsh was proactive in attempting to defend the legitimacy of his bowling action. Marsh's intentions were published in the Sydney Morning Herald and Curran was made aware that Marsh would seek to <b>challenge</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Webber {{clinched}} the pole position and maintained his lead {{at the start}} of the race with Hamilton in second who fended off a challenge from Sebastian Vettel in the other Red Bull. The order was maintained until the first round of pit stops when Hamilton lost second place after his crew had trouble with fitting one of his tyres correctly. Webber conserved fuel on lap 40 which allowed Vettel to <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> for the lead but the two collided which led to the latter retiring from the event and the incident promoted Hamilton and Button into the first and second positions. Hamilton and Button were instructed to conserve fuel for the remainder of the race but the latter had not been giving a target lap time and attempted to overtake Hamilton on lap 48 although the former retained the lead which he held for the remaining ten laps to win his first race of the season.|$|E
5|$|Zahir {{extended}} his rule southward toward Nazareth and the Marj Ibn Amer plain (Jezreel Valley) between Galilee and Jabal Nablus. Capturing these areas was a drawn-out process, and Zahir's efforts to take Nazareth (a town in Safad Sanjak, but {{controlled by the}} Jarrar clan based in Nablus Sanjak) caused the ruling clans of the Nablus hinterland (Jabal Nablus), along with Zahir's erstwhile allies in the Bani Saqr tribe, to <b>challenge</b> <b>him.</b> Zahir, meanwhile, relied on his Zaydani kinsmen, Maghrebi mercenaries whom he commissioned in the mid-1730s under commander Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli, and Nazareth's residents. In 1735, Zahir's 2,000-strong force routed the Jarrars and the Bani Saqr at al-Rawha in Marj Ibn Amer, killed their leader Sheikh Ibrahim al-Jarrar, and captured Nazareth. According to historian Hanna Samarah, Zahir's forces inflicted 8,000 fatalities among the Jarrar-Saqr coalition during the battle.|$|E

5|$|Caesar then {{increased}} the number of magistrates who were elected each year, which created a large pool of experienced magistrates, and allowed Caesar to reward his supporters. Caesar even took steps to transform Italy into a province, and to more tightly link the other provinces of the empire into a single, cohesive unit. This process, of ossifying the entire Roman Empire into a single unit, rather than maintaining it as a network of unequal principalities, would ultimately be completed by Caesar's successor, the emperor Augustus. When Caesar returned to Rome in 47 BC, he raised the senate's membership to 900. While the Roman assemblies continued to meet, Caesar submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment, which caused the assemblies to become powerless and unable to oppose him. To minimize the risk that another general might attempt to <b>challenge</b> <b>him,</b> Caesar passed a law which subjected governors to term limits. Near the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the Parthian Empire. Since his absence from Rome might limit his ability to install his own Consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all Consuls and Tribunes in 42 BC. This, in effect, transformed the magistrates from being representatives of the people to being representatives of the Dictator, and robbed the popular assemblies of much of their remaining influence.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Snow left a year {{prior to}} its events {{promising}} Serah to find Lightning for her. His search would eventually result with him traveling through time while seeing Lightning in a dream telling him to protect the crystal pillar holding Cocoon, seeing {{a vision of the}} world's fate, and becoming a l'Cie once more with the Focus of fighting beside Serah at the final battle. Appearing on Cocoon three hundred years in his future, Snow attempts to destroy a monster threatening Cocoon's supporting pillar. Serah and Noel come to Snow's aid and help him defeat it by negating the anomaly causing its growth. With the threat gone, Snow entrusts Noel with Serah's care and dissolves from the moment in time while promising Serah that they will meet again. Snow then travels to the Coliseum, a fighting arena separated from the flow of time, and after Serah and Noel <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> to combat and win, he is forced to remain due to being bound to the Coliseum by the Chaos.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, 1918, {{incumbent}} senator Ollie M. James died. Stanley appointed George B. Martin {{to finish}} James' term, {{which was to}} expire on March 3 of the following year. James had already been nominated for re-election in 1918 by the Democratic primary, and the task of selecting the party's new nominee fell to the Democratic State Committee, which nominated Stanley. Stanley enjoyed {{the advantage of a}} united Democratic party; J. C. W. Beckham supported Stanley for this seat so Stanley would not <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> for his own seat when he faced re-election. The Republicans chose a relative unknown, Dr. Ben L. Bruner. Stanley was attacked for his veto of the German language bill and for his long-standing views against temperance. Though the national mood was against the Democrats, a letter of support from President Woodrow Wilson bolstered Stanley's campaign, and he defeated Bruner by more than 5,000 votes. He resigned as governor to assume the Senate seat in May 1919. As a Democrat in a mostly Republican Senate, he wielded little influence.|$|E

5|$|The Decepticons {{learn from}} NSA Chief Galloway that Megatron is buried {{deep in the}} Laurentian Abyss. Starscream {{disables}} the Deep-6 aircraft carriers that guard Megatron's remains in the Laurentian Abyss, allowing the Decepticons {{to gain access to}} Megatron's remains. Megatron is revived, and the Decepticons return to the east coast. Megatron disables Optimus Prime and has Starscream destroy a museum that Sam entered, but he is not among the ruins. They learn he was transported to Cairo, Egypt via a space bridge created by Jetfire. Megatron arrives on the outskirts of Cairo and engages Autobots in combat. Jetfire and Bumblebee <b>challenge</b> <b>him,</b> but are defeated. Elsewhere, Long Haul destroys the Axion Gun that the Autobots gave to the NEST Troops. Megatron learns that The Fallen has betrayed him by promising to make him a Prime, learning that Primes are born, not made. Megatron then destroys him before he can fully activate the Sun Harvester, later hearing from Starscream that Optimus Prime has deactivated the machine. Victorious, he begins plans to form an army of new Decepticons.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins when}} the player assumes {{the role of}} a {{stranger}} who arrives at Tantegel Castle. A castle guard tells him that a dragon has captured the princess and is holding her captive in a distant cave. Determined to rescue the princess and defeat the Dragonlord, he discovers an ancient tablet hidden inside a desert cave; carved on the tablet is a message from Erdrick that outlines what the hero needs to do to follow in Erdrick's footsteps and defeat the Dragonlord. The hero eventually rescues Princess Gwaelin, but realizes that in order to restore light to Alefgard, he must defeat the Dragonlord at Charlock Castle. After the hero collects a series of relics, he creates a bridge to reach Charlock and fights his way through the castle before finally confronting the Dragonlord. At this point the hero is given a dialogue choice – to side with the Dragonlord or to <b>challenge</b> <b>him.</b> If players choose the former, the game ends, the hero is put to sleep, and the game freezes; however, in the GBC remake, the hero instead wakes up from a bad dream. If players choose to fight, a final battle between the hero and the Dragonlord commences.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} rivalry scripted into WrestleMania on the Raw brand {{was between}} Randy Orton, John Cena, and Triple H, over the WWE Championship. At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view event in January, Randy Orton successfully defended the WWE Championship against Jeff Hardy {{at the same}} event where John Cena returned from an injury and won the Royal Rumble match, where thirty wrestlers competed in a ring and were eliminated by being thrown over the top rope when he last eliminated Triple H. By winning the match, Cena became a top contender for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXIV. Instead of challenging Randy Orton for the title at WrestleMania, he decided to <b>challenge</b> <b>him</b> at No Way Out. In the match, Orton got himself intentionally disqualified by slapping the referee, thus retaining the WWE Championship due to WWE regulations. That same night, Triple H also became a top contender to the WWE Championship by defeating five other men in an Elimination Chamber match, which featured wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by chains and girders. The next night on Raw, Cena argued that he deserved another WWE Championship match. Raw General Manager William Regal, who was portrayed as a matchmaker and rules enforcer, then announced that Cena would face Orton later in the night. Regal added a stipulation to the match that if Cena won, he would {{be added to the}} WrestleMania match between Triple H and Orton, making it a Triple threat match, a standard match that involves three wrestlers. If Orton won, the main event would remain as Orton versus Triple H in a singles match. However, Cena won the match and was added to the bout at WrestleMania. After the match, Triple H, who was the Special Guest Referee, executed a Pedigree to both Cena and Orton.|$|E
