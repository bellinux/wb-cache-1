40|$|Abstract: Compression {{pressure}} of individual cylinder and valve timing have big influence on combustion pressure, indicated {{mean effective pressure}} (IMEP), emission, vibration, combustion noise and many other combustion parameters. Therefore, uniformity of compression pressure and valve timing became one of most important engine design and production standard. Conventional method to evaluate compression pressure uniformity is to measure each cylinder pressure by mechanical pressure gage during cranking. This conventional method causes inaccuracy of cylinder pressure measurement because of different <b>cranking</b> <b>speed</b> results from battery status and also causes high manhour and cost. To check valve timing, related FEAD parts should be disassembled and timing mark should be checked manually.

50|$|From {{the outset}} the largest problem was {{torsional}} vibration of the crankshaft, {{at one time}} necessitating a ban on using below 4000rpm on the bench. The vibration often caused one or other of the cranks to shear itself off the central spur gear, resulting in the engine becoming two aphasic flat-8s, or the parallel quill shaft (driven at 0.8 times the <b>crank</b> <b>speed,</b> located below <b>crank,</b> and in turn driving the flywheel and ancillaries) overheated and disintegrated.|$|R

40|$|A new {{hydraulic}} {{cam follower}} with {{variable valve timing}} (VVT) properties is described. Experimental {{results show that the}} point of closure of the valve may be delayed as a linear function of engine speed without external control. No other parameter of the valve event is modified by the device. An obvious application is the control of intake valve timing for engines with a wide speed range, where the point of valve closure could be scheduled with engine speed in order to maximise the trapped mass, hence improving the torque curve at low and high speeds. The device is considered for application to the Ford 2. 5 litre DI diesel engine, where it may be used to retard inlet valve closure from close to bottom dead centre (BDC) at <b>cranking</b> <b>speed</b> to 50 - 60 deg after BDC at rated speed. This reduces the compromise in inlet valve timing across the speed range, thereby improving starting or allowing a small reduction of compression ratio, and improving the volumetric efficiency at low and high speeds. An experimental program is reported which consists of rig and engine work based on the Ford 2. 5 litre DI diesel engine. The engine testing shows that the device may be operated quietly, albeit on a diesel engine, and reliably over a wide speed range.
