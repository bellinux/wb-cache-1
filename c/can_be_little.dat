5|$|According to Herodotus, {{both sides}} wished for a decisive battle that would tip {{the war in}} their favor. However, Lazenby {{believed}} that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts to force the Allies into battle but as attempts to force the Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case). Mardonius may have felt he had little to gain in battle {{and that he could}} simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter). There <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle on his own terms, however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies. Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the bad {{conditions}} and high casualties amongst the Anzac troops {{resulted in a}} reasonably prevalent view in Australia that these had been due to the incompetence of British officers commanding the Australian troops and their disregard for the casualties that resulted from poorly planned or ill-conceived attacks. Whether these claims are valid or not, there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> doubt that the entire campaign was poorly conducted, {{and as a result}} there were many military lessons learnt that were to be applied in later campaigns. Despite this, for Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign has come to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage {{and the development of a}} sense of national identity. Today, the date of the initial landings, 25 April, is a public holiday known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations, and indeed in Turkey, to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original Anzacs, and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war.|$|E

25|$|Using {{a normal}} {{distribution}} one can estimate the return period of 1950-level annual rainfall for the Dubbo region as around 375 years, or {{about three times}} the length of instrumental rainfall data.

25|$|On 10 February 1954, a {{few days}} after he talked to Pietro Scaglione, an {{assistant}} prosecutor from Palermo, Aspanu Pisciotta was assassinated by poison in his cell at Ucciardone Prison in Palermo while breakfasting with his cellmate father. The dose was a substantial 20 centigrams of strychnine, enough to kill 40 dogs. There <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> doubt that elements of Mafia committed the crime, with the blessing of the conservative and reactionary politicians with whom they were connected. When Ciro Verdiani and Cusumano Geloso died before their natural life expectancies, suspicions of poisoning were voiced. Benedetto Minasola was murdered in 1960. The Mafioso suspected of poisoning Pisciotta was shot in 1961, and Scaglione was killed by the Mafia while serving as Prosecutor General of Palermo in 1971.|$|E
25|$|In the {{conclusion}} to the essay, he wrote of the Jews that 'only one thing can redeem you from the burden of your curse: the redemption of Ahasuerus — going under!' Although this has been taken by some commentators to mean actual physical annihilation, {{in the context of}} the essay it seems to refer only to the eradication of Jewish separateness and traditions. Wagner advises Jews to follow the example of Ludwig Börne by abandoning Judaism. In this way Jews will take part in 'this regenerative work of deliverance through self-annulment; then are we one and un-dissevered!' Wagner was therefore calling for the assimilation of Jews into mainstream German culture and society - although there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> doubt, from the words he uses in the essay, that this call was prompted at least as much by anti-semitism as by a desire for social amelioration. (In the very first publication, the word here translated as 'self-annulment' was represented by the phrase 'self-annihilating, bloody struggle').|$|E
25|$|His {{advances}} must {{be attributed}} {{mainly to the}} influence of his contemporary Rasmus Christian Rask. Rask was born two years later than Grimm, but his remarkable precocity set him beyond his years. In Grimm's first editions, his Icelandic paradigms are based entirely on Rask's grammar, and in his second edition, he relied almost entirely on Rask for Old English. His debt to Rask can be appreciated only by comparing his treatment of Old English in the two editions; the difference is very great. For example, in the first edition he declines dæg, dæges, plural dægas, without having observed the law of vowel-change pointed out by Rask. (The correct plural is dagas.) There <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> doubt that the appearance of Rask's Old English grammar was the primary impetus for Grimm to recast his work from the beginning. To Rask also belongs the merit of having first distinctly formulated the laws of sound-correspondence in the different languages, especially in the vowels (those more fleeting elements of speech previously ignored by etymologists).|$|E

500|$|According to Todish et al., [...] "there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> {{doubt that}} most Americans have {{probably}} formed {{many of their}} opinions on what occurred at the Alamo not from books, but from the various movies made about the battle." [...] The first film version of the battle appeared in 1911, when Gaston Méliès directed The Immortal Alamo. The battle became more widely known after it was featured in the 1950s Disney miniseries Davy Crockett, which was largely based on myth. Within several years, John Wayne directed and starred {{in one of the}} best-known, but questionably accurate, film versions, 1960's The Alamo. In 2004 another film, also called The Alamo, was released. CNN described it as possibly [...] "the most character-driven of all the movies made on the subject".

500|$|Cope {{was raised}} as a Quaker, and was taught that the Bible was literal truth. Although he never confronted his family about their {{religious}} views, Osborn writes that Cope {{was at least}} aware of the conflict between his scientific career and his religion. Osborn writes: [...] "If Edward harbored intellectual doubts about the literalness of the Bible... he did not express them in his letters to his family but there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> question... that he shared the intellectual unrest of the period." [...] Lanham writes that Cope's religious fervor (which seems to have subsided after his father's death) was embarrassing to even his devout Quaker associates. Biographer Jane Davidson believes that Osborn overstated Cope's internal religious conflicts. She ascribes Cope's deference to his father's beliefs {{as an act of}} respect or a measure to retain his father's financial support. Frazer's reminiscences about his friend suggest Cope often told people what they wanted to hear, rather than his true views.|$|E
500|$|Despite their {{sometimes}} differing viewpoints, {{these experts}} generally agree that Bismarck would have eventually foundered if the Germans had not scuttled her first. Ballard estimated that Bismarck could still have floated {{for at least}} a day when the British vessels ceased fire and could have been captured by the Royal Navy, a position supported by the historian Ludovic Kennedy (who was serving [...] on the destroyer [...] at the time). Kennedy stated, [...] "That she would have foundered eventually there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> doubt; but the scuttling ensured that it was sooner rather than later." [...] When asked whether Bismarck would have sunk if the Germans had not scuttled the ship, Cameron replied [...] "Sure. But it might have taken half a day." [...] In Mearns' subsequent book Hood and Bismarck, he conceded that scuttling [...] "may have hastened the inevitable, but only by a matter of minutes." [...] Ballard later concluded that [...] "As far as I was concerned, the British had sunk the ship regardless of who delivered the final blow." ...|$|E
500|$|In Darwin's {{time there}} was no {{agreed-upon}} model of heredity; in Chapter I Darwin admitted, [...] "The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown." [...] He accepted {{a version of the}} inheritance of acquired characteristics (which after Darwin's death came to be called Lamarckism), and Chapter V discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse; he wrote that he thought [...] "there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>little</b> doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited", and that this also applied in nature. Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of Origin, Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors. However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection. The observation that selection works in domestic animals is not destroyed by lack of understanding of the underlying hereditary mechanism.|$|E
