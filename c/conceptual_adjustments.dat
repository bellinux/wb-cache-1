40|$|The author {{discusses}} the {{challenges faced by}} the Brazilian graduate studies system {{with an emphasis on}} the human health sector. He identifies imbalances in the supply side of knowledge, a prime territory for graduate programs, while highlighting that a proper conceptualization of such imbalances is incomplete if it fails to incorporate the demands for scientific and technological knowledge coming from healthcare services, industry, and society. He draws on concepts from technology economics involved in the innovation systems approach. The article highlights the historical and current role of Brazilian Graduate Studies Coordinating Board (Capes), particularly its evaluation system, as an essential device for overcoming the existing challenges in Brazilian graduate studies. The author concludes by suggesting some <b>conceptual</b> <b>adjustments</b> in the agency&# 8217;s work...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis article {{presents}} a sympathetic but critical examination of institutional ecological economics (IEE) [...] a heterodox {{body of work}} on environmental governance [...] as developed (separately) by J. Paavola and A. Vatn. We highlight the theoretical limitations of IEE related to two issues: {{the causes of the}} emergence of environmental conflicts and the logics driving their regulation. These limitations are all related to the underlying theories of institutional change in which power- and legitimacy-based explanations are confusedly combined. Both authors develop a normative perspective in which legitimacy becomes the main concern. We argue that this perspective leads to contradictions in their respective approaches, and provides no or only partial insights into the conditions of the emergence and regulation of environmental conflicts. We finally highlight the <b>conceptual</b> <b>adjustments</b> (inspired from classical Marxism and regulation theory) that, in our view, are needed to deal more adequately with these issues...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} {{premised on the}} {{assumption}} that in order for us adequately to protect our environment, significant adjustments need to be made to the ways we pursue and think about development - adjustments not merely to technologies but also to life-styles. In this respect the emphasis in much recent development literature on human development is to be welcomed as a useful corrective to definitions of development in terms of economic growth, though there is still a danger of anthropocentric assumptions. It is argued that, given suitable interpretations or conceptions of development and environment, environmental care can be, and should be, integrated into authentic human development. Proposals for such conceptual alignment stem both from seeing the relevant community in which development qua desirable change is to take place as the biotic community, and from seeing development as desirable change in the total environment, both natural and artificial, regarded as a social field of significance. Such <b>conceptual</b> <b>adjustments</b> are a significant part, but of course only a part, of {{what needs to be done}} to bring public policy more into line with proper care for the environment. community, development, environment, evaluation, field of significance, growth, human, rationality, sustainability...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study lies in the <b>conceptual</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the travel career ladder (TCL) {{approach}} to travel motivation. In this context, the study examined the relationship between patterns of travel motivation and travel experience. This research was conducted through two studies: an interview phase to guide the further conceptual development of the travel career approach and a major survey phase for further empirical exploration of the ideas. Overall results suggested that host-site-involvement motivation (e. g., experiencing different cultures) and nature-related motivation (e. g., being close to nature) were more important factors to the more experienced travelers, whereas motivations such as stimulation, personal development, relationship (security), self-actualization, nostalgia, romance, and recognition had a higher priority for the less experienced ones. Importantly, a core of travel motivation factors including escape, relaxation, relationship enhancement, and self-development seem to comprise the central backbone of motivation for all travelers...|$|R
40|$|Pragmatic and {{cognitive}} accounts of figurative language posit {{a difference between}} metaphor and metonymy in terms of underlying conceptual operations. Recently, other pragmatic uses of words have been accounted for in the Relevance Theory framework, such as approximation, {{described in terms of}} <b>conceptual</b> <b>adjustment</b> that varies in degree and direction with respect to the case of metaphor. Despite the theoretical distinctions, there is very poor experimental evidence addressing the metaphor/metonymy distinction, and none concerning approximation. Here we used meticulously built materials to investigate the interpretation mechanisms of these three phenomena through timed sensicality judgments. Results revealed that interpreting metaphors and approximations differs from literal interpretation both in accuracy and reaction times, with higher difficulty and costs for metaphors than for approximations. This suggests similar albeit gradual interpretative costs, in line with the latest account of Relevance Theory. Metonymy, on the contrary, almost equates literal comprehension and calls for a theoretical distinction from metaphor. Overall, this work represents a first attempt to provide an empirical basis for a theory-sound and psychologically-grounded taxonomy of figurative and loose uses of language...|$|R
40|$|Central ethical {{concepts}} in {{education should be}} interpreted in a  global frame, beyond the conceptual confines of the nation state. My underlying claim is that globalisation’s effects and significance are profound, but that while new global practices, norms and structures are increasingly evident, developing our key ethical concepts and assumptions accordingly {{is limited by the}} narrow and outdated moral universe of the nation state. The intertwined demands of justice and democracy in education now require <b>conceptual</b> <b>adjustment</b> to meet a different world. First, the features and significance of globalisation are considered, with particular reference to globalisation in education, as well as political globalisation as indicative of the now outdated model of the Westphalian state. Secondly, a revised conception of justice based on recognition of global association is sketched and illustrated by the case of the global campaign for Education for All. Thirdly, possibilities for globally democratic decision-making after the monopoly of the nation state are outlined, advancing the discussion towards some concluding observations about the implications of the argument for the education of global citizens...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} main informational, {{conceptual}} and theoretical adjustments {{made to the}} HDI in the Mexican Human Development Reports and presents {{a way in which}} the calculation of the HDI could be carried out to the individual level. First, informational changes include redistributing government oil revenues from oil producing regions {{to the rest of the}} country in order to obtain a better picture of available resources and imputing per capita average household income to all municipalities combining census and income surveys. Also, state information is used to set counterfactuals about the first effects of internal migration on development, and municipal data is applied to decompose inequality indices to identify the sources and regions contributing to overall human development inequality. Second, <b>conceptual</b> <b>adjustments</b> consider introducing two additional dimensions to the HDI: being free from local crime and the absence of violence against women. Third, a key theoretical contribution from the Mexican National Reports to the HDI literature is the proposal of an inequality sensitive development index based on the concept of generalized means. Finally, the proposed disaggregation of the HDI at the household and individual level allows analyzing development levels for subgroups of population either by age, ethnic condition, sex and income or HDI deciles across time.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The author presents a new framework for approaching {{command and control}} in {{operations other than war}} (OOTW). Currently, no common doctrine exists between potential coalition partners to guide the command and control process in this particular environment. As a consequence, coalitions are formed ad-hoc, which has potential consequences for the adequacy of the resulting command and control process and system, and commensurately, for the speed and impact a coalition may have in a target environment. The author examines current U. S. perceptions concerning command and control, intelligence, and communications, and the <b>conceptual</b> <b>adjustments</b> required for U. S. forces involved in the irregular environment. Challenges and lessons learned from recent OOTW are then discussed in order to identifiy, to the degree possible, specific impediments to optimum coalition command and control. Conclusions stress that a common and standardized approach is required to blend the political agendas, capabilities, and limitations of a diverse coalition into an efficient and effective entity. To accomplish this, the approach must include a methodical and iterative process which logically, chronologically, and holistically frames and links the problem at hand, the resources arrayed to address the problem, and the functions that compromise the problem solving process, in a manner appropriate to existing conditions at any particular time.

40|$|Summary: The {{monitoring}} and communication {{indicators of the}} enterprise’s performance {{have an important role}} in the successful implementation of the system of management of value. The new indicators of the management orientated towards value achievement (towards the increase of the shareholders ’ wealth and the enterprise’s value and performance) are generally characterized by the difference between the economic result obtained through the running activity of the enterprise (running clear profit or running cash-flow) and the cost of the total used capital. Key words: Economic Value Added, invested capital, capital cost The management of value is a new method within the financial management, focused on value achievement, by obtaining greater performances than the cost of the attracted capitals. The {{monitoring and}} communication indicators of the enterprise’s performance have {{an important role in the}} successful implementation of the system of management of value. The new indicators of the management orientated towards value achievement (towards the increase of the shareholders ’ wealth and the enterprise’s value and performance) are generally characterized by the difference between the economic result obtained through the running activity of the enterprise (running clear profit or running cash-flow) and the cost of the total used capital. The usage of these indicators requires as a consequence to this, relatively high costs of implementation but facilitates at the same time the adoption of some tactical and strategic decisions that would lead to getting superior benefits to the cost of the used capital. The modern indicator of the enterprise’s performance and the economic value added clarify some important <b>conceptual</b> <b>adjustments,</b> both in calculating the economic result and especially in grounding the capital base. The economic value added is determined: EVA = The running clear profit – (CI x The average balanced cost of the capital), where CI = the invested capital, or EVA = (The rate of investment profitability – the capital cost) x CI The rate of investment profitability...|$|E

40|$|Archiving and {{processing}} of personal data and its overall treatment in relation with medical care service {{is still an}} underestimated issue. Current situation is influenced mainly by the fact, that traditional, yet obsolete, paternalistic conception of relation between medical care provider and patient comes out of centralistic view on health care system that gave the provider (respectively medical staff), as the stronger side of this relation, almost exclusive powers over human (patient). Result of this phenomenon was a continuous and universal disrespect to the right to privacy and implying right to protection of personal data. Data relating to health condition of person were thought of as property of medical staff that got used to treat them at their will. All of this was happening within legal regulation that was far from being perfect. Significant and <b>conceptual</b> legal <b>adjustment</b> was set when ratifying Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine (n. 96 / 2001 Sb. m. s.).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} new estimates of employment, nominal and real GDP in Tanzanian Manufacturing, 1961 - 1995. Time series of GDP and employment are placed in comparative perspective by linking them to benchmark level comparisons of GDP and employment for 1989. The {{first part of the}} paper (sections 2 - 4) deals with adjustments to nominal GDP, based on in depth analysis of the data of the 1989 industrial census, earlier census data and industrial surveys. Adjustments are made for undercoverage, omitted establishments, non-response and <b>conceptual</b> <b>adjustments</b> in the concept of value added. After adjustment, nominal manufacturing value added in establishments with 10 is substantially higher. The adjustments vary from 3 % in 1978 to 127 % in 1988. On average the upward adjustment is 52 per cent. New consistent time series of nominal GDP are presented both for aggregate 10 + manufacturing (1961 - 1995) and for six branches of manufacturing (1965 - 1995) The second part of the paper (section 5) focuses on the construction of a consistent long term index of industrial production, using weighted quantity relatives. The index is constructed for aggregate 10 + manufacturing and six branches. Corresponding indices of employment are derived, using the same adjustments for undercoverage, omitted establishments and non-response {{as in the case of}} GDP. The third section of the paper (section 6) {{presents a}} benchmark comparison of real value added relative to world manufacturing productivity leader, the USA. The benchmark uses average unit value ratio’s to convert value added for purposes of real comparisons. These unit value ratio’s are derived from the industrial census product listings in Tanzania and the USA, according to the industry of origin methodology of the international comparisons of output and productivity project (ICOP). Census listings contain quantity and value information, which are used to make product matches. In 1965 comparative labour productivity in aggregate manufacturing was around 9 per cent of the US level. It increased until 1973 to 11 per cent, followed by a long period of decline. By 1989 labour productivity stood at 3. 7 of the US level. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{contingency}} {{model for}} system development {{was subjected to}} several <b>conceptual</b> and operational <b>adjustments</b> and empirical tests. According to the model, {{there should be a}} degree of fit between development project uncertainty and the strategy for determining information requirements, ranging from accepting initial requirements statements to experi menting with prototypes to discover requirements. This study introduced a new IRD strategy construct that focused on the extent of interaction between users and developers. The study also differentiated between perceptual and evidential outcomes, between process and product outcomes, and between users’and developers’ points of view. The hypotheses predicted that the degree of fit between project uncertainty and the IRD strategy would account for perceptual and evidential project outcomes from both the user's and developer's points of view. Results indicated that only by relying on the new extent of interaction construct, was support found. From the developers'standpoint, the degree of fit appeared to be related to perceptual assessments of the process and product. From the user's standpoint, the degree of fit was only related to perceptual assessments of the process. There was no support for the hypothesized impact of fit on evidential outcomes. © 1998, Authors. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Interrogating the {{relationship}} between copyright enforcement and privacy raises deeper questions {{about the nature of}} privacy and what counts, or ought to count, as privacy invasion in the age of networked digital technologies. This Article begins, in Part II, by identifying the privacy interests that individuals enjoy in their intellectual activities and exploring the different ways in which certain implementations of DRM technologies may threaten those interests. Part III considers the appropriate scope of legal protection for privacy in the context of DRM, and argues that both the common law of privacy and an expanded conception of consumer protection law have roles to play in protecting the privacy of information users. As Parts II and III demonstrate, consideration of how the theory and law of privacy should respond to {{the development and implementation of}} DRM technologies also raises the reverse question: How should the development and implementation of DRM technologies respond to privacy theory and law? As artifacts designed to regulate user behavior, DRM technologies already embody value choices. Might privacy itself become one of the values embodied in DRM design? Part IV argues that with some <b>conceptual</b> and procedural <b>adjustments,</b> DRM technologies and related standard-setting processes could be harnessed to preserve and protect privacy...|$|R
40|$|Although Instrumentality and Expressivity {{scores have}} been shown to be {{powerful}} intrapersonal predictors of reported relationship satisfaction and <b>adjustment,</b> <b>conceptual</b> models exploring the mechanisms by which Instrumentality (I) and Expressivity (E) influence intimate relationships are few. The results presented in this thesis are derived from two studies, each using survey research methods and the little-used Bem Sex Role Inventory Short-Form (BSRI-SF). Study 1 (N = 75 couples) examined several statistical and methodological issues in using the short form BSRI in couples research. Study 2 (N = 119 couples) provided a preliminary evaluation of a model in which it was proposed that the relations among Instrumentality (I), Expressivity (E), and relationship adjustment are mediated in part by interpersonal processes related to couple conflict resolution (CR) and maintenance and enhancement of intimacy (MEI). A number of gender-specific findings were obtained. The proposed model was supported using a path analytic approach comparing the direct model of IE with the mediator model. Specifically, variance in men's reported levels of dyadic adjustment covaried with their own levels of Instrumentality, Expressivity, and self-reported intimacy and conflict behaviour. Variance in women's reported levels of dyadic adjustment covaried in a complex fashion with their own and their partners' scores. Across couple-related variables (DAS, CR, and MEI), results generally supported a main effects model (i. e., significant statistical prediction from Instrumentality scores and/or Expressivity scores), but not an interactional model (Instrumentality times Expressivity). Results indicated that use of the BSRI-SF's nonconfounded Instrumentality and Expressivity subscales can be valuable in model testing in couples research. It is suggested that the short-form provides ease of interpretation compared to the controversial long-form BSRI. Gilligan's theory of gender-specific developmental tasks is proposed as a framework for understanding the gender-specific correlational patterns which emerged...|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{explanations}} of schizophrenia that presume schizophrenia spectrum disorders (e. g., schizotypal personality disorder, schizoaffective disorder, etc.) to be genetically related to schizophrenia, {{the purpose of}} this study was to investigate the attention and information processing abilities of individuals who have been identified as schizotypal or psychosis-prone (i. e., schizophrenia spectrum functioning in individuals who do not have schizophrenia). Research indicates that persons identified as psychosis-prone may show attention and information processing deficits similar to individuals with schizophrenia. The identification and description of individuals who later decompensate into schizophrenia would advance the understanding of schizophrenia and its causes. The Chapman's PER-MAG scale (Perceptual Aberration-Magical Ideation) was used to identify 35 hypothetically psychosis-prone college students (schizotypy group) and 42 normal college students (nonschizotypy group) out of the 806 volunteer subjects. Their attention and information processing abilities were measured by COGLAB (a multiparadigmatic cognitive test battery that represents a continuum of cognitive functions, from preattentional to attentional, to <b>conceptual).</b> Their social <b>adjustment</b> was measured by the Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS). The hypotheses of the study were that the hypothetically psychosis-prone subjects would perform poorer than controls on COGLAB measures and that COGLAB measures of a more molar nature would better predict social adjustment than would the more molecular tasks. The results of the study did not support the hypotheses as there were no significant differences between the schizotypy group and the nonschizotypy group and the measures of a more molar nature did not better predict social adjustment. Further research might consider increasing the sample size, applying more stringent cut-off criteria for the schizotypy group, and verifying the validity of using PER-MAG, COGLAB, and PAS with this population. Further research also needs to clarify the ways in which those identified as psychosis-prone process information like (or unlike) nonschizotypes and how their current social functioning might be related to their deficiencies...|$|R
40|$|Studies have {{indicated}} that many, although by no means all, people with epilepsy have difficulty in adjusting to the disorder, manifest by higher rates of psychological and social problems than amongst the general population. A variety of neurological and environmental factors have been hypothesized to contribute to these consequences. It {{has been suggested that}} the severity of seizures may be an important factor in determining psychological and social well-being, but very little research has investigated this empirically. This study was therefore undertaken to investigate the relationship between patient-rated seizure severity and adjustment to epilepsy. If greater seizure severity was associated with poorer adjustment, measurement of seizure severity might provide a suitable means of identifying those patients who could benefit from a psychoeducational intervention programme, and may also serve as a useful measure of treatment efficacy. In addition, the research considered the value of Wright's (1990) comprehensive conceptual model for the definition and assessment of adjustment, as much {{research in the area of}} adjustment to chronic illness has suffered from insufficient definition and difficulties with measurement. The results indicated that seizure severity was only weakly associated with psychological and illness-related measures of adjustment. These associations would not be sufficiently strong to allow the proposed use of seizure severity as an indicator of poor adjustment, although there may be some value in using this variable as a measure of treatment efficacy in addition to seizure frequency. The <b>conceptual</b> model of <b>adjustment</b> was found to be of value as a framework for guiding operationalisation and measurement of adjustment. Results tentatively confirmed the associations currently suggested within the model and further additions were proposed. Suggestions for future research are made.

40|$|Field-measured data {{collected}} from infiltration experiments conducted at the Maricopa Agricultural Center, Arizona, and one-dimensional numerical models were used in an iterative approach to develop conceptual models of unsaturated flow and transport. Conceptual models were developed using field data, estimates of hydraulic and transport properties, and assumptions regarding the types of processes occurring in the field plot. Using the field data and numerical models in an iterative approach revealed that adjustments to the parameterization of the conceptual models were necessary to allow for acceptable predictions of flow and transport. In addition, the numerical models delineated where the <b>conceptual</b> models needed <b>adjustment</b> and indicated where further analysis of the field data was necessary. Specifically, {{in regards to the}} unsaturated water flow, it was found that: (1) without increasing the laboratory determined value of Ks tenfold, it was impossible to make acceptable predictions for the infiltration experiments; (2) the laboratory-derived hydraulic properties provided a superior first approximation to texturally based hydraulic properties taken from an internal database; (3) incorporation of hysteresis into the soil hydraulic functions resulted in predictions of the water contents through time and soil water content profiles that were marginally better than not incorporating hysteresis; and (4) based on the mean square errors of the predictions and a post-audit based on the adjusted hydraulic properties, the use of a homogeneous soil profile was supported. In regard to the unsaturated solute transport, it was found that: (1) inversion techniques to estimate the unsaturated transport properties at each location (local approach) yielded the best results with respect to the fit of the data compared to the techniques which fit data from all depths simultaneously (global approach); (2) predictions using unsaturated transport properties averaged from the global approach yielded the best results compared to the average local approach properties; (3) incorporating hysteresis had little effect on the predicted bromide breakthrough curves and concentration profiles, yielding only marginally better results than predictions from models with no hysteresis; (4) it was impossible to accurately predict the breakthrough of bromide at depths deeper than 200 cm without using a retardation factor less then one...|$|R
