2500|$|Divers {{worked to}} tunnel under O-5s bow so lifting cables could be attached. Ajax arrived about midnight, and by early morning, the cable tunnel had been dug, the cable run, and a lift was attempted. [...] Sheppard J. Shreaves, {{supervisor}} of the Panama Canal’s salvage crew and himself a qualified diver, had been working continuously throughout the night to dig the tunnel, snake the cable under the submarine, and hook it to Ajax’s hoist. Now the lift began. As the crane took a strain, the lift cables broke. Shreaves and his crew worked another <b>cable</b> <b>set</b> under the bow and again Ajax pulled. Again, the cable broke. All through the day, the men worked. Shreaves {{had been in his}} diving suit nearly 24 hours. As midnight on [...] the 29th approached, the crane was ready for another lift, this time with buoyancy being added by blowing water out of the flooded Engine Room. Then, just after midnight, the bow of O-5 broke the surface. Men from the salvage force quickly opened the torpedo room hatch, and Breault and Brown emerged into the fresh air.|$|E

5000|$|For example, a {{coaxial cable}} {{used by a}} cable {{television}} system can carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. At the cable source or headend, electronic upconverters convert each incoming television channel to a new, higher frequency. They do this by mixing the television signal frequency, fCH with a local oscillator at a much higher frequency , creating a heterodyne at the sum , which is added to the cable. At the consumer's home, the <b>cable</b> <b>set</b> top box has a downconverter that mixes the incoming signal at frequency [...] with the same local oscillator frequency [...] creating the difference heterodyne, converting the television channel back to its original frequency: [...] Each channel is moved to a different higher frequency. The original lower basic frequency of the signal is called the baseband, while the higher channel it is moved to is called the passband.|$|E

50|$|In 1980, Newhouse {{sold its}} entire {{television}} division, including WSYE and WSYR, to the Times Mirror Company. The new owners changed the call letters to WSTM-TV and WETM-TV respectively. Times Mirror gradually cut the last {{ties between the}} two stations while establishing WETM as a full-fledged station in its own right. It sold WETM to Smith Broadcasting in 1986. Under Smith's ownership, {{a reversal of the}} station's origins took place with the April 1996 launch of a cable-only Binghamton version of WETM through a local marketing agreement with Time Warner <b>Cable.</b> <b>Set</b> up in the wake of established NBC affiliate WICZ-TV defecting to Fox, the arrangement saw Time Warner Cable sell Binghamton-market advertising and replace syndicated programs that aired on other Binghamton stations with programming acquired by WETM for the Binghamton market, while WETM sold regional advertising seen in both markets. In 1997, Smith bought Binghamton low-power station WBGH-LP and made it an over-the-air semi-satellite of WETM; WBGH eventually split off except for simulcasting WETM's newscasts.

5000|$|A small jet aircraft, (Hansa-Jet), {{pursuing}} the lead characters played by Eastwood and Sheen, complements another tightly coordinated stunt scene (aerial coordinators James W. Gavin and Eric W. Gray). After chasing the two detectives through a grassy area, the Hansa-Jet is {{hit by a}} Convair 880 depicted as landing, (the initial sequence showing the aircraft on approach uses a BAe 146). Both the San Jose and Mojave airports were scripted as LA International Airport during filming of the scene. Right before the impact, the Hansa-Jet was actually stationary being pulled by a 150-foot steel cable attached to a 4-wheel drive pickup truck right before the explosion erupted. Frazier explained, [...] "The reason we did that is because if the planes collide first, it's likely they'll upend all our wires and the explosion wouldn't occur at all. Another reason is that had the Hansa-Jet not demolished before impact, it could have spun the other plane around, and we might have {{ended up with the}} 880 in our shot instead. The ensuing explosion after the Convair dissects the Hansa-Jet was powered by 10 gallons of gasoline and 4 separate 18-inch mortars.

5000|$|Many modern {{cable systems}} are now [...] "all digital" [...] meaning analog video signals have been {{discontinued}} {{in order to}} reuse spectrum. The RF channels analog used to occupy are now open for a cable system to reuse most commonly as High Speed Data (commonly {{referred to in the}} industry as [...] "HSD") channels to increase subscriber download/upload internet speeds. (see DOCSIS) Analog video removal also essentially eliminates cable theft since analog signals were transmitted unencrypted. Most digital video signals are compressed to MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 formats in order to combine multiple video streams into a QAM making the most efficient use of spectrum which a customer <b>cable</b> <b>set</b> top box receives, demodulates, de-encrypts and displays as a virtual channel number that the viewer recognizes. In many cases the same TV network may appear multiple times in a local channel lineup as a different channel the viewer sees (I.E. CNN as 34, 334, 1034) this is due to previous generations of channel lineups kept in service and intended to not confuse viewers who are familiar with the network appearing on a number they are used to. Although a channel may be in a line up multiple times the RF QAM it is combined or [...] "muxed" [...] into is modulated and compressed just once. A set top box tunes to that same QAM when any instance of that network is called by the viewer. Virtual channeling also allows the cable operator to change the physical frequency a QAM is on without the viewer noticing the channel number changing in their lineup.|$|E
