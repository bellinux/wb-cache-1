40|$|Abstract. Electronic <b>concept</b> mapping tools {{provide a}} {{flexible}} vehicle for constructing <b>concept</b> maps, linking <b>concept</b> maps to other <b>concept</b> maps and related resources, and distributing <b>concept</b> maps to others. As electronic <b>concept</b> maps are constructed, {{it is often}} helpful for users to consult additional resources, in order to jog their memories or to locate resources to link to the map under construction. The World Wide Web provides a rich range of resources for these tasks—if the right resources can be found. This paper presents ongoing research on how to automatically generate Web queries from <b>concept</b> maps under construction, in order to proactively suggest related information to aid <b>concept</b> mapping. First, it examines how <b>concept</b> map structure and content can be exploited to automatically select terms to include in initial queries, based on studies of (1) how <b>concept</b> map structure influences human judgments of <b>concept</b> importance, and (2) the relative value of including information from <b>concept</b> labels and linking phrases. Second, it examines how a <b>concept</b> map {{can be used to}} refine future queries by reinforcing the weights of terms that have proven to be good discriminators for the topic of the <b>concept</b> map. The described methods are being applied to developing “intelligent suggesters ” to support the <b>concept</b> mapping process. ...|$|R

A qualitative toolkit for analysing <b>concept</b> drift is proposed to detect <b>concept</b> shift and stability when <b>concept</b> identity is available, and <b>concept</b> split and strength of morphing chain if using the morphing theory. We apply our framework in four case-studies: a political vocabulary in SKOS, the DBpedia ontology in RDFS, the LKIF-Core ontology in OWL and a few biomedical ontologies in OBO. We describe ways of identifying interesting changes in {{the meaning of}} <b>concept</b> within given application contexts. These case-studies illustrate the feasibility of our framework in analysing <b>concept</b> drift in knowledge organisation schemas of varying expressiveness. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.
