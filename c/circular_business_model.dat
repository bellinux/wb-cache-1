To mention just a few examples: product-service systems, virtualized services, and collaborative consumption which encompasses the sharing economy. This comprises both the incentives and benefits offered to customers for bringing back used products and a change in revenue streams, comprising payments for a circular product or service, or payments for delivered availability, usage, or performance related to the product-based service offered.|$|E

40|$|This is a master’s thesis {{project of}} 30 credits written with {{guidance}} from the Swedish research institute ICT Viktoria and Industrial Ecology at KTH. This thesis is conducted by two students at KTH, {{one with a}} background in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Ecology {{and the other with}} a background in Energy and Environmental Technology. This study focuses on circular economy linked to the furniture industry in Sweden and how the transition from theoretical to practical concepts can be improved. The methods of this thesis consist of three semi-structured interviews, a survey and an analytical comparative literature review. The interviews, survey and literature review is analyzed with the purpose of finding important criteria relevant for office chairs in <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models.</b> The interviews are performed face-to-face with three different key persons; an office supply manager, a CEO at a refurbishing company and a product manager. The study focuses on product design within the Swedish furniture industry although some aspects regarding <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models,</b> logistics and psychological values are included. The results are design criteria for office chairs in <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models</b> and a design evaluation program for the industry built on these. The program, based on multi criteria analysis, can help reduce the gap between theory and practice of how circular economy should be implemented in the industry. By giving early feedback during the design phase on how well an office chair and a company’s structure meet circular economy criteria the authors hope to ease and speed up this transition. The main characteristics of an office chair designed for <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models</b> are: Durable Easy to service Adaptable Modular Homogeneous material composition in modules Although the transition to <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models</b> can be a comprehensive process the authors believe that if furniture manufacturers would integrate <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models</b> for office chairs into their business structure this would be both economically viable and highly beneficial for their environmental profile which can strengthen their position on the market. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} to a Circular Economy requires enabling conditions that remove existing barriers in product utilisation and material recovery operations. The adoption of <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models</b> {{is one of the}} key building blocks of the Circular Economy, but the viability of such businesses is often dependent on supporting policies. This contribution reviews the literature on resource efficiency policies, relevant to building materials and the construction sector, and discusses how current and new policies can support <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models,</b> building upon two company case studies. The companies are specialising in construction solutions, by providing highly durable, reusable and fully recyclable building components. The cases are built on semi-structured interviews with company representatives and follow-up surveys. Both companies agree that building passports and material passports, along with design for deconstruction, building modularity, durability and reuse/recycling at materials level should be established, so that reusable building materials can be efficiently salvaged and returned for further utilisation or recycling. Green public procurement can play a fundamental role in increasing the uptake and use of durable and recyclable products. Economic instruments such as tax reductions for recycled materials can boost greater utilisation of secondary materials in buildings. Given the long lifetime of buildings, it is considered essential to encourage design improvements and <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models</b> through appropriate policy instruments...|$|R

40|$|Switching {{from the}} current linear model of economy to a {{circular}} one has recently attracted increased attention from major global companies e. g., Google, Unilever, Renault, and policymakers attending the World Economic Forum. The reasons for this are the huge financial, social and environmental benefits. However, the global shift from one model of economy to another also concerns smaller companies on a micro-level. Thus, comprehensive knowledge on designing circular business models is needed to stimulate and foster implementation of the circular economy. Existing business models for the circular economy have limited transferability {{and there is no}} comprehensive framework supporting every kind of company in designing a <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>model.</b> This study employs a literature review to identify and classify the circular economy characteristics according to a business model structure.

40|$|Circular {{business}} models are foreseen {{to contribute to}} enabling prolonged lifetimes of products and components through successive cycles of reuse, repair, remanufacturing and closing material loops. To realize economic viability and resource efficiency savings from a <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>model,</b> early consideration and integrated planning of the product lifecycle and value creation architectures at the relevant points in the lifecycle is pivotal. However, the current frameworks for business model design have not been designed to recognize the specific opportunity points of the product lifecycle to create and capture additional value from cycling resources.

To attend to this gap, this paper develops a <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>model</b> framework that is based on the current understanding of resource efficiency strategies and systematically integrates lifecycle value management with traditional business model design thinking. Through this, the developed framework is intended to serve as guidance for <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>model</b> development to incorporate circular principles and to capitalize on additional value from cycling resources. To explore the usefulness of the framework developed from literature, a comparative case study design with two cases of Swedish companies operating circular {{business models}} is employed.

40|$|Volatile {{resource}} prices, supply disruptions, {{economic losses}} and environmental strain has lead researchers and businesses to seek {{for an alternative}} to the linear production model. Circular economy has risen as a sustainable alternative, both economically and environmentally. Research has pointed to huge value gains both nationally and globally. However, <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models</b> are yet to be widespread among businesses. To address this scarcity of <b>circular</b> <b>businesses</b> in Norway, we look into strategic elements that could explain the situation today, as well as Norwegian industry’s way forward. Through this, we recognize collaboration as a competitive strategy that should be evident in a transition to a circular economy in Norway. We study 15 cases that all have incorporated principles of circular economy to varying degree. To assess the strategic elements of their <b>business</b> <b>models,</b> we conduct interviews on the subject of collaboration in relation to their circular operations. The Relational View created a basis for the structure of our interviews and the further discussion, as well as theory on value generation through collaboration. The thesis discusses interview findings relevant to the research on circular economy and Norwegian industry’s characteristics. Eventually, we map the 15 companies’ <b>business</b> <b>models,</b> and discuss this in relation to some of Norway’s comparative advantages. Our findings provoke the conclusion that collaboration is essential for how businesses transition to, and operate, <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models.</b> Moreover, Norwegian industry’s characteristics of trust and reciprocity generate favorable conditions for close collaborations. Collaborating in clusters and industrial parks further enhances the strategic benefits, as it is proposed to facilitate for specialization, knowledge-sharing, relation-specific investments, and utilization of complementarities. Lastly, increased involvement and risk-taking from the government’s side, is suggested as imperative for a circular economy to be feasible in a larger scale. Hereby, our thesis contributes to the emerging literature on circular economy and <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models.</b> Exploring this in the context of <b>circular</b> <b>businesses</b> in Norway, enables us to provide businesses and researchers with a comprehensive overview of the circular economy in Norway today, and in the years to come...|$|R

The transition from the current linear economy in which we take, make, use, and dispose of resources to a circular economy in which waste becomes raw material is expected to close material loop. To advance the era of the circular economy and foster the participation of companies, understanding <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models</b> is essential. This research studied three cases of <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models</b> (CBMs). The companies that use resource-based CBMs and bulk waste and deal with business customers were selected. Black Bear Carbon generates carbon black from end-of-life tires, DSM NIAGA provides carpet machines and adhesive that enables the production of 100 % recyclable carpet, and Van Houtum generates toilet paper from used paper. The findings of this research are threefold: (1) the concept of upcycling is one of the elements that defines a CBM, (2) the most critical factor for the success of CBM is a circular value network, (3) the <b>business</b> <b>modelling</b> tools for CBMs should emphasize the element of circular values. This brings the theoretical contributions to the definition of CBM and developments of the <b>business</b> <b>modelling</b> tools for CBMs. The practical contributions are made to the firms who are considering implementing a CBM as a reference book.

40|$|Design {{has been}} {{recognised}} in the literature as a catalyst {{to move away from}} the traditional model of take-make-dispose to achieve a more restorative, regenerative and circular economy. As such, for a circular economy to thrive, products need to be designed for closed loops, as well as be adapted to generate revenues. This should not only be at the point of purchase, but also during use, and be supported by low-cost return chains and reprocessing structures, as well as effective policy and regulation. To date, most academic and grey literature on the circular economy has focused primarily on the development of new <b>business</b> <b>models,</b> with some of the latter studies addressing design strategies for a circular economy, specifically in the area of resource cycles and design for product life extension. However, these studies primarily consider a limited spectrum of the technical and biological cycles where materials are recovered and restored and nutrients (e. g., materials, energy, water) are regenerated. This provides little guidance or clarity for designers wishing to design for new <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models</b> in practice. As such, this paper aims to address this gap by systematically analysing previous literature on Design for Sustainability (DfX) (e. g., design for resource conservation, design for slowing resource loops and whole systems design) and links these approaches to the current literature on <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models.</b> A conceptual framework is developed for circular economy design strategies.

40|$|Abstract A {{circular}} economy {{is an alternative}} to a traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) in which resources are kept in use {{for as long as}} possible, value creation is maximized in the use phase and products and materials are recovered {{at the end of each}} service life. The thesis explores this concept by taking a business model perspective. The theoretical part of the thesis clarifies the phenomenon of {{circular economy}}. It summarizes the development of the concept from an historical perspective and clarifies its position with regards to existing contemporary concepts (biomimicry, industrial ecology, cradle to cradle, blue economy, performance economy). By taking a business model perspective on the concept, the thesis attempts to offers a first typology of circular business models. Through the field work, the thesis extends knowledge on the understanding of circular business models at practical level. It highlights the differences between the theoretical underpinnings of the concept (its principles) and its implementation, showing that there is a gap between the concept and the way companies implement it. The findings allow the author to discuss how circular business models are classified and shows that many hybrid circular approaches can emerge. The analysis of the common features of the cases allow the author to draw a first set of normative requirements that define how a <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>model</b> is organized. The cross analysis of the cases supports the development of a framework highlighting the current drivers at internal and external level pushing company to operate within circular economy principles, addressing a set of conditions allowing for the successful implementation of circular business models, while acknowledging a number of recurrent challenges preventing from a full implementation of the concept.

40|$|Background The {{awareness}} of the expolition of resoucses in a way where the world {{will not be able}} to sustainable continute to provide for has grown over the last decades. In turn this has given rise to the concept of circular economy and the idea of how to maximase utilisation of raw materials and products. Contribution This thesis aims to look into how the ideas of circular economy can effect the business models of producers in the office furniture industry and what opportunities and barriers there are for moving towards more circular models. The pracitical contribution consists of the mapped effects and impacts of circular economy in the Business model canvas. Methodology The research is conducted in a case study manner with ten semi-structrued interviews with actors within the industry. The empirical findings were analysed in a cross-case analysis. Then the empirical and theoretical findings were compared in a case-theory analysis. Findings Our conclusions suggest four main findings. Firstly, to extend the life of the products and to better take care of material waste after usage, sales of function through rental models are suggested. Secondly, the products should be designed for remanufacture, repair, reuse and recycle. Thirdly, there is a need of capacity by the producers to handel the return flow; the logisticst and how to intergrate the reusage of material in the current processes. Finally, the mindset of customers, where there today is a need of owning products in comparison to having the function of the product. Recomentations The authors recommend the producers to move towards circular models and suggest that some steps could be taken today. Firstly, developing the design of the furniture in consideration to choice of material and reusage. Secondly, make strategic partnerships with actors which in the long run can help the transition to a full <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>model</b> and finally, give the cusomers the right incitements to make conscious decisions. The authors believe that with these steps the sales of function also will come more natural. MSc in Innovation and Industrial Managemen...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how {{a number of}} Swedish firms try to create and appropriate economic value from offers that are differentiated by low environmental impact. It presents empirical, methodological and theoretical contributions to the environmental strategy literature, focusing on the appropriation of economic value by profit-seeking firms. Based on accounting and survey data and a novel methodological approach the thesis shows that, in small Swedish firms, environmental differentiation is negatively associated with economic performance. It shows also that for environmentally differentiated offers, a resource efficient design leading to low {{total cost of ownership}} for customers is positively associated with economic performance. Other hypothesized benefits related to environmental differentiation, such as increased sales from communicating environmental superiority, associated regulatory support and improved product quality, are not significantly related to economic performance. Based on a multi-level qualitative study of an established firm, the thesis explains how corporate visions and top managers’ explicit commitment to increased sustainability facilitate the commercialization of environmentally differentiated offers. This study shows that cleverly formulated environmental goals may enable a firm to accelerate and achieve wider diffusion of already developed, originally customized solutions to specific customer problems. A longitudinal study of a small manufacturing firm developing and launching a service-based, <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>model</b> built on remanufacturing, provides a rare examination of the challenges and opportunities encountered during the development of such a business model. An important conclusion {{of this study is that}} service-based circular business models, by design, imply a larger business risk during their implementation than more traditional, so-called linear business models. The thesis proposes a theoretical framework of appropriation strategies specifically related to environmental differentiation. The framework draws on the problem-solving perspective of the firm and the social dilemma literature to derive four generic appropriation strategies in which many of the drivers of environmental differentiation reported in prior literature can be understood as special cases. The four appropriation strategies exploit the advantages from resource efficiency, reputational gains, regulatory fit and closer inter-firm value chain integration...|$|E
40|$|The {{circular}} economy is an emerging model that experts believe {{is able to}} resolve the conflict between resource constraints, environmental degradation and economic growth. In short, it is a model for an economy designed to work {{in harmony with the}} environment by designing out waste, relying on renewable energy and embracing diversity and systems thinking. Many have claimed that companies will lead the transition to a {{circular economy}}. However, much is still not understood about how companies can prosper in a circular economic system. In this study, I first review the literature to propose a definition for a <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>model.</b> I define it as the rationale of how an organization creates and delivers value to customers and captures value for itself while it simultaneously designs out waste, relies on renewable energy, thinks in systems, and embraces diversity to build organizational resilience. A thorough review of the literature reveals that the elements of circular business models are often discussed by isolating one business model element such as product as service systems as revenue models. Since isolated elements alone cannot effectively design out waste, I argue that a more holistic, systems thinking perspective is needed. In the empirical part of this study, I explore how companies use the business model to design out waste and operate in a circular economic system using a more holistic framework. I investigate the business models of four companies-Patagonia, Rype Office, Splosh and Desso-and analyze them using the business model canvas as a research lens. My analysis shows that all of the cases studied need at least seven (of nine) business model elements to design out waste. The results indicate that to support circularity companies must design the business model holistically, focusing on several business model elements simultaneously. This explorative study takes the first steps in the long journey to understanding circular business models. It provides support for a holistic approach and clues for further research. Yet, in the domain of circular business models, many opportunities remain for future research...|$|E
40|$|To {{meet the}} United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) on {{sustainable}} {{production and consumption}} (goal 12), the construction sector {{should be considered a}} key area to improve efficient use of natural resources (goal 12. 2) and reduce waste generation (goal 12. 5). With buildings being more energy efficient during their use phase, the relative importance of embodied energy and natural resources is becoming more significant to enhance resource efficiency of buildings. To save embodied energy and resources, scholars in the resource efficiency field have studied and developed a range of strategies that cycle resources at product, component or material level (circular strategies). These circular strategies aim to first prolong the useful life of products and components (e. g. trough repair, refurbishment, or remanufacturing), and then close material flows (through recycling) once the end-of-life is irreversibly reached. This has the potential to maintain the quality of resources over time beyond a single life and reduce resource extraction and waste generation. Recently, circular strategies have gained renewed attention under the concept of a circular economy. However, for the construction sector to transition towards a circular economy requires systemic innovation throughout the value chain. Resources recovered at the end-of-life (components or materials) need to be reintegrated into the value chain. To aid such innovations, the recently advanced concept of a <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>model</b> might be useful. Innovating the business model presents a way to embed a circular strategy into a company’s logic of doing business in a more holistic way. In the construction value chain for buildings, a number of front-running companies have successfully devised business models that aid the implementation of circular strategies. Understanding is still limited about what changes in business model elements can aid companies to successfully implement circular strategies. Therefore, this research aims to provide an overview of business model innovations that facilitate adoption of circular strategies for building materials, employing a comparative case study design with six cases of companies operating circular strategies in the Dutch, Danish and Swedish construction sector. Findings include an overview of business model innovations throughout the construction value chain for buildings and adjustments in business models that were identified to support the application of circular strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{circular}} economy offer opportunities to reduce resource use and waste whilst providing business opportunities. This {{is also true}} in the mobile phone industry that has been characterised by high rates of product obsolescence. The emergence of the smart phone has changed the landscape, making repair, refurbishment and resell attractive to businesses and consumers. Moreover, emerging modular phone design should allow functional upgrades with low resource wastage.   This report investigates the adoption of <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models</b> within Nordic markets. Producers, retailers, refurbishers, recyclers and resellers tell of their motivation, experiences and the challenges that they face. A special look is taken at consumer and waste law and the challenges and opportunities they represent. The report ends with 17 policy proposals that can accelerate the adoption of circularity in the sector...|$|R
40|$|Since the Industrial Revolution, humanity’s use {{of natural}} {{resources}} has been basically the same: TAKE, MAKE and THROW AWAY; which consequently led to the indispensable problems of waste materials. Around 461 million tons of Construction & Demolition Waste (C&DW), excluding excavation materials, are yearly generated in EU 28. This undoubtedly gives a call to novel closed-loop <b>circular</b> <b>business</b> <b>models</b> which reshape the Eco-system {{in a way the}} waste is 'designed out'. Here, we present a novel closed-loop circular economy model of a high-performance building insulation material from silica containing C&DW materials to silica aerogels with λ≈ 0. 015 W/mK. In the present model, the benefit comes with the use of massive construction waste to a silica precursor and thereby aerogel production guaranteeing at least 40 % product cost reduction and 40 % reduction in energy consumption in real construction environment...|$|R
40|$|Purpose- The overall aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a new {{conceptual}} framework for <b>business</b> <b>model</b> innovation in a circular economy and to explore the reasons for consumer non-adoption of <b>business</b> <b>models</b> in this context. Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on existing work in mostly professional or for-business publications and develops a conceptual model by clustering and abstraction. For developing hypotheses on motives for consumer non-adoption the author refers to existing empirical research in various related fields. Findings – The first part of the paper demonstrates that, despite wording differences, a predominant agreement on a basic structure for new <b>business</b> <b>models</b> in a <b>circular</b> economy has emerged in the field. The second part provides evidence that the adoption of <b>circular</b> economy <b>business</b> <b>models</b> will depend upon changing consumer habits and routines by leveraging the impact of non-functional motives, as well as subjective and moral norms. Practical implications – For practitioners working on new innovative <b>business</b> <b>models</b> in the realm of the circular economy this paper provides a basic framework for clustering their concepts. By learning about consumer motives leading to non-adoption, this paper also provides support for designing better and more successful <b>business</b> <b>models.</b> Originality/value – This paper develops a new holistic framework for the emerging topic of <b>circular</b> economy <b>business</b> <b>models.</b> Keywords...|$|R
