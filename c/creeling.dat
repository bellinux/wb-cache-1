40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of 'ghost fishing' {{has been identified as}} a major issue in the capture fishing industry. The present study assesses the potential for ghost fishing in the <b>creel</b> (baited trap) fishery for Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus, one of the most valuable fished species in European waters. Baited <b>creels</b> were deployed and monitored at a shallow and a deep site for 363 and 217 d, respectively. Catch was counted at regular intervals by SCUBA diving at the shallow site and by periodically hauling <b>creels</b> at the deepwater site. Both trials showed that most captured species were able to escape from the <b>creels,</b> with only N. norvegicus being trapped {{for long periods of time}}, suggesting that <b>creels</b> are very selective for the target species.

The main reasons for the low ghost fishing performance of N. norvegicus <b>creels</b> may be the design of the <b>creel</b> itself (which allows non-target species to escape relatively easily), the behaviour of N. norvegicus restricting the number of animals entering the <b>creels</b> once the bait has been consumed, and the ability of N. norvegicus to survive for long periods of time once caught...|$|R

In {{the early months of}} 1989, a few ovigerous Carcinus maenas obtained by diving were examined. Ovigerous Liocarcinuspuber and L. depurator were caught in small numbers, and both were infested with the parasite. In L. depurator the gills were heavily infested with the encysted juveniles, but few worms were found in the egg mass, 7 being the highest number in a single crab. In L. puber up to 25 worms were found in an individual crab, but the number of cysts in the gills was low. Only one ovigerous C. maenas was obtained by creeling; the egg mass contained only a few nemertines, and very few cysts were found on the gills. However, of the few shore crabs obtained by diving, one had the highest number of free-living worms found on an egg mass (42), but again very few cysts were found on the gills.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a study into two post capture conditions, idiopathic muscle necrosis (IMN) and a post capture opportunistic bacterial infection, affecting the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, and a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} stressors involved in the capture and post capture periods of the fishery process. A multivariate approach was used to study progression in the post capture condition of trawl-caught N. norvegicus for the live transport market. Prolonged periods of aerial exposure resulted in large disruptions to the carbohydrate profile, increases in haemolymph L-lactate and crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone concentrations, and corresponding fluctuations in haemolymph pH. These disruptions increased with the increasing temperature of aerial exposure, which impacted the immunocompetence of the lobsters: circulating haemocytes and phenoloxidase levels were significantly reduced {{and the degree of}} bacteraemia increased. The health status of N. norvegicus captured during trials in spring and autumn by means of short trawl (1 h duration), long trawl (5 h duration) and <b>creeling</b> was assessed using a range of physiological (Haemolymph L-lactate, crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH), abdominal muscle glycogen concentrations), immunological (total haemocyte counts (THC) and physical (mortality, damage indices) parameters. Increased duration of trawl did not significantly alter physiological parameters, while time of landing did {{have a significant effect on}} L-lactate, where animals landed in the morning exhibited higher concentrations. Seasonal variations in abdominal muscle glycogen concentrations were also apparent. Irrespective of season, individuals captured by short trawls in the morning suffered lowest mortalities. Damage assessment data revealed that a greater proportion of individuals were categorised as heavily damaged following longer trawls conducted in spring. The carbohydrate profile and immunocompetence of N. norvegicus was significantly affected following trawl capture and subsequent handling and aerial exposure post capture. The recovery period was investigated through a range of parameters (L-lactate, glycogen, glucose, THC) and the data suggested that animals should be submerged and unstressed for at least 24 h following capture and handling to avoid further alterations to the carbohydrate profile and reduce the window of opportunity for invading bacteria to cause meat spoilage. The influence of air temperature on the condition of N. norvegicus caught for the live export market was assessed by correlating meteorological data with the percentage of catch accepted for live transport. Results illustrated a large degree of variability in the conditions of animals on arrival at the processing plant. Air temperature was the only meteorological factor that had an impact on the morbidity and mortality of the catch. In one instance in particular, mean air temperature on the day of capture had a significant negative impact on the health of the catch...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} a number of aspects of the Nephrops creel fishery. Various aspects have been studied. In particular, work has focused on how the biology of Nephrops affects its catchability in creels, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of the Nephrops creel fishery. A smaller study relating to the physiological effects of the capture and transport of live creel-caught Nephrops, has also been undertaken. Fishery-directed sampling of Nephrops displayed strong seasonal trends in catch composition and catch rate, reflecting patterns in the Nephrops moult and reproductive cycles. Most females were caught in the early spring, following moulting and mating, with catch rates becoming low after spawning in autumn. Catches of males were greatest around February following moulting. Of those animals caught, males were larger than females. These seasonal patterns reflect the exploitation of different components of the stock throughout the year. Fishery sampling also showed there to be considerable stock heterogeneity both among and within creel fisheries. Global positioning system (GPS) -linked data loggers fitted to selected fishing boats provided a more detailed assessment of spatial variability in catch rate. Results showed both effort and landings per unit effort (LPUE) to be patchily distributed in the area studied, further illustrating considerable stock heterogeneity throughout the area. Both approaches illustrated that catch rate varied with sediment type, with high catch rates of small animals on sandy to firm mud and high catch rates of large animals on softer mud. Additionally, population modelling indicated that, in the areas studied, Nephrops are not currently being growth overfished. Behavioural observations in both the field and laboratory indicated a low probability of entry to creels by approaching Nephrops, particularly if other crustacean species were inside the creel. Larger Nephrops appeared to have a greater threshold for disturbances such as and the presence of conspecifics or other species as well as reduced gear avoidance, suggesting that Nephrops creels select larger animals in the population. Using sea pens as an indicator of physical disturbance of the sea bed showed that impacts from <b>creeling</b> were low. The sea pens Virgularia mirabilis and Pennatula phosphorea were caught in moderate quantities in the creel fishery, but were still observed in high densities on creel grounds. Comparison with trawled areas showed some differences in density, the most notable being that the tall sea pen Funiculina quadrangularis was less abundant on trawled grounds, indicating an adverse effect of bottom-towed gear. Bycatch was assessed in two distinct fisheries and varied both between and within areas; however, levels of bycatch (both target and non-target species) in all areas were much lower than previous estimates from the trawl fishery. Additionally, in contrast to the trawl fishery, commercially exploited fish made up a small proportion of the bycatch in the Nephrops creel fisheries studied. The survival of Nephrops discards is considered to be high, although preliminary results suggest that predation by seabirds may cause significant mortality. The effects of ‘ghost fishing’ were investigated experimentally at two sites and it seemed that lost creels do not constitute a serious issue in this fishery. Creels were found to be very selective for their target species, with both target and non-target species being able to escape. Only a few crabs and a small proportion of the captured Nephrops died in the creels, indicating no evidence of a ‘re baiting’ effect from dead animals. Stress associated with the capture, storage and live transport of creel-caught Nephrops was found to be greatest during the transport process, during which Nephrops are kept out of water for long periods of time. Temperature was particularly important, suggesting cooling prior to and during transport was essential in order to ensure their survival. Reduced salinity was found to be a major source of stress. An assessment of the management measures implemented in the Torridon creel fishery show that escape gaps placed in creels are effective in enabling smaller Nephrops and other bycatch species to escape. Limiting effort of individual fishermen has been successful, but this has been followed by {{an increase in the number}} of boats fishing within the area, leading to an overall increase in effort. Management measures (both statutory and voluntary) currently applied in the Torridon area are discussed and considered in relation to other areas. It is concluded that creel fishing areas need to be considered on a case-by-case basis, accounting for biological characteristics of individual stocks, as well as management issues at a local scale. The findings of the present study are discussed in the context of providing a detailed description of the characteristics of the Nephrops creel fishery on the west coast of Scotland. Findings are also discussed in relation to other crustacean creel fisheries, enabling issues directly relevant to the specific fishery to be considered in a much broader context. The present study has been particularly valuable in a wider context, as Nephrops are found in a habitat which is very different from the majority of other commercially exploited crustaceans, and their life history characteristics are also different. This study provides an ideal platform to assess what general principles from other creel fisheries apply to the Nephrops creel fishery, as well as what characteristics are unique to this fishery.

During the lasts decades, the modernisation of the trawling fleet with the resulting technological improvements, has lead to an increase in fishing effort. Nowadays, the two populations on the South and SW coast are considered outside biological safe limits, and a recovery plan is underway. Two typical vessels, in each fleet (trawling and <b>creels),</b> were selected to collect biological and economic data. Results show that the size composition of the catches is very different for the two gears used. Trawl catches are composed of small individuals usually in bad condition, while <b>creel</b> catches are composed of large and alive individuals (very high commercial value). It is assumed that the size composition obtained with <b>creels</b> results from the selectivity of the <b>creel</b> and the fact that these populations are exploited at much lower fishing levels.

50|$|<b>Creel</b> {{was founded}} {{with the name}} ‘Estación Creel’ on May 26, 1907, as a {{railroad}} depot on the Chihuahua - Pacific line. It was named after Enrique <b>Creel</b> governor of Chihuahua state at the time. He {{was the son of}} Reuben W. <b>Creel,</b> American delegate in Chihuahua. <b>Creel</b> was founded as a planned agricultural settlement that was intended to have a small number of Mexicans who were supposed to spread their culture onto the Tarahumara who were supposed to be the majority of the population. It was supposed to have 25 Mexican and 75 Tarahumara families, but in its early years only had about 30 Tarahumara families although the right number of Mexicans.|$|R

After <b>Creel</b> is nearly beaten due to Thor's fighting skill, Loki transports him to Asgard and reveals the true source of his [...] "absorbing" [...] powers. After being humbled by Loki, <b>Creel</b> agrees to act as his agent, and he is directed {{to take over the}} city. The Absorbing Man defeats the Asgardian legions without too much trouble and eventually confronts Odin himself. <b>Creel</b> absorbs Odin's attacks and then the properties of Asgard itself, hoping to rule the Universe, and he towers over Odin as Loki arrives to gloat. Thor is ordered by Odin not to keep attacking. Loki and <b>Creel</b> are then beaten by trickery; once given Odin's Rod of Rulership the two quarrel over it, the Absorbing Man trying to absorb the rod, and the two find they cannot let go. Odin then advises them that his power lies not in a mere object, but deep within himself. The pair are then banished to space.|$|R
