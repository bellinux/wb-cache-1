40|$|Of the 17 million m 3 of {{forestry}} barks, approximately 40 % {{is used as}} a source of energy in Canadian pulp and paper mills. In recent years, due to their high fraction of tannin, lignin and cellulose, forestry barks have attracted growing interest as feedstock for development and commercialization of industrial biochemicals and biomaterials. The purpose of this work is to develop a cost-effective process to extract the key components of barks and convert them into high value-added polymers to contribute in replacing the products made from materials with a more intensive carbon footprint. Tannin and lignin constitute 50 % of bark components. With a growing interest in greener water-soluble polyphenols, bark-based tannins are opening up new potential markets such as wood adhesives and rigid foams for building insulation. Global tannin market is expected to witness substantial growth over the next ten years. In this poster presentation, we focus on the cost-effective method for the extraction of tannins from <b>Canadian</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> barks. The aim is to maximize tannin yield while minimizing energy and water consumptions and extraction cost. Mechanical preprocessing of the fresh-cut barks was carried out to facilitate the extraction of tannins. Extraction was taken place in hot water with the presence and absence of ultrasound energy, as well as in near-supercritical CO 2 -H 2 O system. Different extraction parameters, such as temperature, pressure, time, liquid/solid ratios, pH, CO 2 /H 2 O ratios, were used to optimize the technical performance of the tannins extraction processes. Water and energy consumptions for every step in the process were evaluated and minimized. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|PROJECT OBJECTIVES: (1) Determine {{relationships}} between condition of <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> trees, associated low-soil-calcium tolerant tree species, and associated soil chemistry (pH, Al/Ca, toxins, etc.) in the Southern Appalachians (SoApps); (2) assess {{the potential of}} <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> to indicate forested areas susceptible to climate change and other regional stressors (e. g., insects and pathogens, etc.) and increased buildup of wildfire fuels and fuel ladders from high <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> mortality; (3) and develop maps of forest areas at elevated risk from regional stressors like climate change based on condition of <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> and associated soil chemistry. JUSTIFICATION: <b>Yellow</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) is a common tree species found from ME to GA, typically at higher elevations on cooler and moisture slopes in the Southern Appalachians (SoApps). This project examines in-situ {{relationships between}} the condition of <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> in SoApps and associated soil chemistry. In the Northeast <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> is impacted (e. g., damaged boles and crowns,, reduced growth, and increased rates of mortality in larger dbh trees) by low soil pH and nutrient cations; and high available aluminum (Al) and toxic metals (e. g., lead, zinc, etc.) linked to long-term acidic deposition on soils with low buffer capacity (pers. comm.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} environmental {{controls of}} <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula alleghaniensis Britton) distribution at its northern distribution limit in eastern Canada, we analyzed abundance, age structure, biomass accumulation rate, and growth sensitivity to climate {{of this species}} at 14 sites along a 200 km latitudinal gradient spanning three bioclimatic domains and reaching frontier populations of this species in western Quebec. We observed a large variability in seedling density across domains and presence of sites with abundant <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> regeneration within all three bioclimatic domains. Seedling density was positively correlated to mean age and abundance of <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> trees in the canopy, while sapling density was positively associated with dryer habitats. Growth patterns of canopy trees showed no effect of declining temperatures along the south-north gradient. Environmental controls of birch distribution at its northern limit were realized through factors affecting birch regeneration and not growth of canopy trees. At the stand scale, regeneration density was strongly controlled by local site conditions and not by differences in climate among sites. At the regional scale, climate variability could be an indirect driver of <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> distribution, affecting disturbance rates and, subsequently, availability of suitable sites for regeneration...|$|R

40|$|Past {{silvicultural}} treatments {{have resulted}} in the high-grading mixed temperate forests of Québec, Canada. Despite recognition of this issue, the low occurrence of <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula alleghaniensis Britton) within current stands raises questions about the potential of the species to grow and eventually constitute a high-quality forest resource. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess this potential using tree characteristics, forest structure and additional site and climatic conditions as predictors. A total of 145 trees were sampled in two areas located in the same bioclimatic zone. Lower-Saguenay-Charlevoix was chosen as an area where a restoration plan could be implemented, whereas Portneuf was selected as a reference. We used nonlinear mixed models to investigate which environmental factors are likely to influence the radial growth and stem quality of <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> sample trees. Our results suggest that topographic and climatic conditions, as well as the competitive environment of the trees, are important factors to consider in the evaluation of <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> production. Despite the limited occurrence of <b>yellow</b> <b>birch,</b> the potential for growth and quality was high in the Lower-Saguenay-Charlevoix area. For equivalent topographic, climatic, and competitive environment conditions, there was no significant difference in either radial growth or stem quality with Portneuf. We suggest that the economic interest of producing high quality timber should be used to justify the implementation of a restoration strategy in the Lower-Saguenay-Charlevoix area...|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} effects of liming (V 500 kg/hectare) and the cutting of V 1000 m 2 gaps on the {{formation}} of mushrooms in a yellow birch/sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) forest, all mushrooms were collected and quantified from twelve 49 m 2 plots. The liming had a neutral or positive affect on the fruiting of most species, for example, certain Hygrophorus species. Ectomycorrhizal taxa (eg. Entoloma salmoneus, Lactarius rufus) generally had decreased fruiting in the gaps whereas many non-mycorrhizal taxa were unaffected by the cuts. Species of Hebeloma and Laccaria however did not show any response to the treatments. The ectomycorrhizae on mature <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> were quantified using morphological and molecular analyses. Ectomycorrhizal abundance was compared to mushroom abundance and confirmed the lack of correlation between fruiting and mycorrhizal colonisation of <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> roots. The proportion of ectomycorrhizal ITS RFLPs matching mushroom RFLPs (34 %) agreed with other studies. The matches included species of Cortinarius, Hebeloma, Laccaria and Russula. The data from seedlings from the same site showed that fungal taxa colonizing mature <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> had a higher diversity, due to a more even distribution. Some species of Hebeloma and Laccaria appeared to be more abundant on seedlings while species in the Russulaceae appeared to be more abundant on mature trees. These differences may reflect {{the importance of the}} fungal partners for the establishment and survival of <b>yellow</b> <b>birch...</b>|$|R

The high root:shoot biomass ratio and carbohydrate concentration of sugar maple are characteristic of species with truncated growth patterns (i. e., cessation of aboveground shoot growth early in the growing season), a conservative growth strategy and high shade tolerance. The low root:shoot biomass ratio and carbohydrate concentration of <b>yellow</b> <b>birch</b> are characteristic of species with continuous growth patterns, an opportunistic growth strategy and low shade tolerance. In both species, starch represented up to 95 % of total nonstructural carbohydrates and was mainly found in the roots.
