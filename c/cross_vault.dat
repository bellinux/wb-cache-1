There is a prolonged choir with stellar vaults connected to the main presbytery with pointed arch {{on the north side}} of the presbytery. Arches in the upper part are designed as tribunes. The choir extension in the south side have a polygonal end and stellar vault. Pointed arcades separate the individual naves. Arcades are supported by massive polygonal pillars. A vaulting of the main nave is different from the side naves. The nave has a Late Gothic stellar vault and the side naves have stellar and net vaults. Parts of bend shafts and brackets on the north side have been preserved from the original Gothic church. The south part of the side nave is vaulted with <b>cross</b> <b>vault</b> with figural brackets at its end. The cathedral has original Gothic windows with graduated tracery all around its circuit. The original supporting pillars are preserved as well. The domination of the building is the tower, which has a Pseudo-Gothic arcades and high pyramidal roof, which was built in 1903. The entrance of the tower is with a Gothic portal. There were built smaller towers as a decoration on the corners of the main tower.|$|E

50|$|The mosque has an {{octagonal}} {{base with}} a central dome. Its plan is a variant of that of the Rüstem Pasha Mosque, but variations such as its corner domes give it a more classical character than the Rüstem Pasha Mosque. It {{is also one of}} the earliest examples of the 18th-century trend towards domes that were proportionally higher and narrower. The <b>cross</b> <b>vault</b> over the central opening is an innovation first seen in this mosque. Rather than the five domes over the entrance portico - typical for Ottoman mosques - the Yeni Valide employs a <b>cross</b> <b>vault</b> over a central bay and cloister vaults over side bays. The interior decoration consists of stone carvings including muqarnas - intricate stone carvings with floral motifs - and tiles with repetitive floral patterns.|$|E
