5|$|By {{the fall}} of his junior season, the Illinois class of 2014 was being {{mentioned}} {{as one of the}} all-time great statewide classes of basketball players. Chicago Sun-Times writer Joe Henricksen noted that there was a high chance that this would be the fifth Illinois class and first since 2002 to include three McDonald's All-Americans. He also noted that the <b>class</b> <b>has</b> a chance to rival if not surpass the classes of 1998 and 2011 which each had nine top 100 players.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with some of}} the more novel features of Bulleid's design, all members of the class were modified by British Railways during the late 1950s, losing their air-smoothed casings in the process. The Merchant Navy class operated until the end of Southern steam in July 1967. A third of the <b>class</b> <b>has</b> survived and can be seen on heritage railways throughout Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|From 1967, Oslo Sporveier {{transferred}} all its trams to Bærumsbanen, {{where they}} remained in use until 1985. The <b>class</b> <b>has</b> {{been involved in}} several fatal incidents, including the Strømsveien tram fire in 1958. Six trams (prototype no 163, nos 166, 170, 196 and 199) remain at the Oslo Tramway Museum; whilst Oslo Sporveier has kept two and converted them to maintenance vehicles (nos 185 and 198), painted them yellow with zebra stripes. They also kept one themselves as a veteran tram (no 183).|$|E
50|$|As of 2012 {{the school}} has about 150 {{students}} and 80 teachers, with each <b>class</b> <b>having</b> 15 students. Some <b>classes</b> <b>have</b> two or three teachers.|$|R
50|$|The {{study of}} sixth graders was confounded {{by the fact}} that the Jigsaw <b>class</b> <b>had</b> two {{teachers}} whereas the control <b>class</b> <b>had</b> only one teacher.|$|R
50|$|The Olympic sailing <b>classes</b> <b>have</b> {{been used}} in the sport of Sailing/Yachting during the Olympic Summer Games since 1896. Since then, 46 {{different}} <b>classes</b> <b>have</b> been used.|$|R
5|$|The Merchant Navy <b>class</b> <b>has</b> {{been the}} subject of several models by {{different}} manufacturers, including Hornby Railways, Graham Farish and Minitrix. The first OO gauge model of an as-built locomotive was produced by Graham Farish in 1950 followed by Hornby/Wrenn in 1962 and by the modified version.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} current project is SEA 4000 the procurement of three Hobart-class destroyers, which {{will replace the}} Adelaide class. These ships will be fitted with the Aegis combat system, and {{will be based on}} the Spanish F100 design. The <b>class</b> <b>has</b> a planned in service date of 2013, with the three units to be named Hobart, Brisbane, and Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Evolve {{features}} {{a total of}} 20 different human characters split into four classes, each class containing 5 characters. Each <b>class</b> <b>has</b> different skills and abilities, and players are required to cooperate {{with each other in}} a match. Players unlock new characters as they progress through the game, e.g. the fourth Assault character will be unlocked if the player has upgraded the previous three Assault characters. The Hunters class features first-person gameplay. The ammunition of their weapons is automatically refilled when not in use, and iron sights are used in- game. Evolve does not allow multiple players to play as the same class in a match. Gameplay variations are also present within the characters in the same class.|$|E
50|$|Music and art <b>classes</b> <b>have</b> {{been taught}} {{for many years}} and {{continue}} to this day. Additionally, the school has a summer camp. Recently, adult mandarin <b>classes</b> <b>have</b> opened up.|$|R
30|$|Another {{recurrent}} characteristic is that, in all analyzed scenarios, Negative, Trump Supporter, and Hillary Supporter <b>classes</b> <b>had</b> homophily. Among these classes, Trump Supporter is {{the class}} with lowest homophily level. Trump Supporter <b>class</b> <b>had</b> IHi values ranging from 0.02 to 0.06 in the reciprocal connections, while Negative and Hillary Supporter <b>classes</b> <b>had</b> IHi values ranging from 0.08 to 0.21 in the reciprocal connections.|$|R
50|$|Extensionality: <b>Classes</b> <b>having</b> {{the same}} members {{are the same}} class.A set and a <b>class</b> <b>having</b> the same {{extension}} are identical. Hence MK is not a two-sorted theory, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding.|$|R
5|$|In most of {{the class}} Enopla ("armed"), the {{proboscis}} exits from a common orifice of the rhynchocoel and mouth. A typical member of this <b>class</b> <b>has</b> a stylet, a calcareous barb, with which the animal stabs the prey many times to inject toxins and digestive secretions. The prey is then swallowed whole or, after partial digestion, its tissues are sucked into the mouth. The stylet is attached about one-third of distance {{from the end of}} the ed proboscis, which extends only enough to expose the stylet. On either side of the active stylet are sacs containing back-up stylets to replace the active one as the animal grows or an active one is lost. Instead of one stylet, the Polystilifera have a pad that bears many tiny stylets, and these animals have separate orifices for the proboscis and mouth, unlike other Enopla. The Enopla can only attack after contacting the prey.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the Allies' {{occupation}} of Japan, special-service officers of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed virtually all records, drawings, and photographs of or relating to the Yamato-class battleships, leaving only fragmentary records of the design characteristics and other technical matters. The destruction of these documents was so efficient that until 1948 the only known images of Yamato and Musashi were those taken by United States Navy aircraft involved in the attacks on the two battleships. Although some additional photographs and information, from documents that were not destroyed, have come to light over the years, the loss of the majority of written records for the <b>class</b> <b>has</b> made extensive research into the Yamato class somewhat difficult. Because of the lack of written records, information on the class largely came from interviews of Japanese officers following Japan's surrender.|$|E
5|$|Season {{one begins}} with Alex Parrish, a former FBI recruit, {{becoming}} a prime suspect following {{a terrorist attack}} on Grand Central Terminal. She is taken into custody and charged with treason. Her first escape is orchestrated by Deputy Director Miranda Shaw, her primary instructor at Quantico, who refuses {{to believe that she}} is guilty and feels someone from her <b>class</b> <b>has</b> framed her. Various flashbacks show Parrish and fellow agents, each having their secret reasons for joining the FBI, training at the FBI Academy. The present timeline focuses on the restrained relationship between Parrish and her boyfriend Ryan Booth and fellow trainees and friends, including: Shelby Wyatt, Nimah and Raina Amin, Simon Asher, Brandon Fletcher, Elias Harper and Caleb Haas, who all somehow seem connected to the bombing, while she is on the run to prove her innocence.|$|E
50|$|Three {{examples}} of the 5205 <b>class</b> <b>have</b> been preserved. No members of the 5275 <b>class</b> <b>have</b> been preserved in their original form, but two survive in rebuilt form in the 7200 class.|$|R

25|$|In 1948, {{classes were}} {{considered}} to be large. A typical grade 9 <b>class</b> <b>had</b> 41 pupils and a grade 13 <b>class</b> <b>had</b> 40 pupils. Discipline was tight and was expected and respected by parents.|$|R
5|$|The Iowa <b>class</b> <b>has</b> become {{culturally}} symbolic in the United States in {{many different}} ways, {{to the point where}} certain elements of the American public—such as the United States Naval Fire Support Association—are unwilling to part with the battleships despite their apparent obsolescence in the face of modern naval combat doctrine that places great emphasis on air supremacy and missile firepower. Although all have been officially stricken from the Naval Vessel Register they have been spared scrapping and were donated for use as museum ships.|$|E
5|$|The LSWR N15 {{class was}} a British 2cylinder 4-6-0 express {{passenger}} steam locomotive designed by Robert W. Urie. The <b>class</b> <b>has</b> a complex build history spanning three sub-classes and {{eight years of}} construction from 1919 to 1926. The first batch of the class was constructed for the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), where they hauled heavy express trains to the south coast ports and further west to Exeter. After the Lord Nelsons they were the second biggest express passenger locomotives in the Southern Railway.|$|E
5|$|They {{awake in}} a {{classroom}} in a small, vacated island, surrounded by troops, and wearing metal collars around their necks. A teacher, psychopathic sadist Kinpatsu Sakamochi, briefs the students: the <b>class</b> <b>has</b> been chosen {{to participate in the}} Program. They have three days to kill each other until one stands as the victor, or the metal collars will detonate, killing them all (as Sakamochi gleefully demonstrates on one student). The students are issued survival packs and a random weapon/tool, and sent out onto the island one by one. While most of the students receive guns and knives, some acquire relatively useless items like boomerangs, dartboard darts, or a fork. Hiroki Sugimura finds a radar device that tracks nearby students, and Toshinori Oda receives a bulletproof vest.|$|E
50|$|After the Coast Guard {{took over}} the United States Lighthouse Service in 1939, {{the plans for the}} USLS Juniper class of 177 ft {{seagoing}} buoy tenders were modified to 180 ft.

5|$|Units are {{classified}} {{into one of}} several classes: infantry, ranged, pikemen, cavalry, or siege. Each unit <b>class</b> <b>has</b> unique strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing the importance of properly matching up units in battle to increase their effectiveness. Hero units are unique in that only one of each can be created; they consist of characters from the novel, such as Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Saruman, Nazgûl, Mouth of Sauron, Arwen and Shelob, or are created via the game's Hero Creator (only accessible via the PC version). If the player kills Gollum, a non-player character, they are rewarded with the One Ring. The item {{can be used to}} summon one of two ring heroes for a price of 10,000 resources, Galadriel and Sauron, depending on the player's faction. Ring heroes have extremely strong armor and powerful attacks, making them among the game's most over-powered units.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of three}} Kolkata-class ships was {{sanctioned by the}} Government of India in May 2000, and steel for the lead ship was cut in March 2003. Construction began in September 2003 at Mazagon Docks, Mumbai, with an initial {{expectation}} that {{the first of the}} class would be handed over to the navy by 2010. However, since then the Kolkata <b>class</b> <b>has</b> suffered consecutive delays, slow construction procedures and technical problems which saw the first ship of the class enter service during mid 2014. The delays in the construction programme have been attributed to persistent design changes made by the Indian Navy to incorporate new weapons systems and sensors, failure by a Ukrainian shipyard to deliver the ship's propellers and shafts and the contract later being awarded to a Russian firm, and finally the delay in the delivery of the Barak 8 anti-air missiles, which are still {{in the final stages of}} completion with Israel Aerospace Industries and the Defence Research and Development Organisation.|$|E
5|$|The {{surge of}} air travellers, catalyzed by {{low-cost}} carriers {{and the rise}} of air-transport demands among Indonesia's rising middle <b>class,</b> <b>has</b> put intense stress on Indonesia's aging airports. Nevertheless, there has been some efforts to improve and upgrade airport facilities, such as the construction of Medan's brand-new Kuala Namu Airport to replace the overwhelmed, aging, and accident-prone Polonia Airport. Other newly built airports include Lombok Airport, replacing the old Selaparang Airport in Lombok; and Minangkabau Airport, replacing the old Tabing Airport in Padang. Existing airports that have undergone massive expansion and upgrades include Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali, Juanda Airport in Surabaya, and Sultan Hasanuddin Airport in Makassar. There are plans to build a second Bali airport in Kubu Tambahan near Singaraja, northern Bali, a new larger airport in Kulon Progo near Yogyakarta to replace the crowded and overwhelmed Adisutjipto Airport, and Kertajati Airport in Kertajati, Majalengka, to replace Bandung's Husein Sastranegara Airport and also to serve the vicinity of Cirebon. To improve transportation interconnectivity, the government plans to build railways connecting airports all over Indonesia with nearby city centers. Currently, only Kuala Namu and Adisutjipto airports have a railway connection to the city center, while airport railways are currently under construction in Soekarno–Hatta and Minangkabau airports.|$|E

50|$|Under the IPC Athletics {{classification}} system, {{this class}} competes in T54 and F54. Field events open to this <b>class</b> <b>have</b> included shot put, discus and javelin. In pentathlon, the events for this <b>class</b> <b>have</b> included Shot, Javelin, 200m, Discus, 1500m.|$|R
5|$|Units {{each have}} a {{character}} class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, and how much effect they have on other units, whether they used passive or aggressive skills. There are thirty classes available to choose from: these include mounted units such as the Pegasus Knight, Sorcerers and Healers that wield magic for attack and healing respectively, soldiers who wield swords and axes, and archers who specialize in long distance attacks. The only class that is character exclusive is the Lord class, which is used by Marth. Limitations are placed on how many of one class {{can be used in}} a single battle. When a unit has reached Level 10, their class can be evolved along a select number of routes using an item called a Master Seal. Units can also be re-classed, changing to a completely different class or back to their original class at the player's discretion: the re-class options has limits as there are only a limited number of available classes for a unit to change into. If a class change is reversed, all the unit's previous stats will be retained. Each unit's weapon, which is directly associated with its <b>class,</b> <b>has</b> its level raised based on the amount of usage, while also decreasing its durability — unless merged with another identical item, the weapon will break after its maximum number of uses.|$|E
