When more than one forecast is available, the analyst can improve forecast accuracy by using a <b>composite</b> <b>forecast.</b> One of several approaches to forming <b>composite</b> <b>forecasts</b> is a Bayesian approach using matrix beta priors.

40|$|The {{volatility}} {{accuracy of}} several volatility forecast models is examined {{for the case}} of daily spot returns for the Mexican peso - US Dollar exchange rate. The models applied are univariate GARCH, a multi-variate GARCH (the BEKK model), option implied volatilities, and a <b>composite</b> <b>forecast</b> model. The <b>composite</b> specification includes time-series (ARCH-type) and option implied volatility forecasts. Different {{to most of the}} literature, this paper includes a statistical evaluation of the forecast accuracy of a composite model and models that are not combined. The results show that the <b>composite</b> volatility <b>forecasts</b> are superior to the other models in terms of mean squared errors (MSE). In forecast evaluations of the MSE it was found that estimates were statistically significantly different between <b>composite</b> <b>forecast</b> estimates and its counterparts.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The study evaluates {{performances}} of three multiple time series (MTS) forecasting methods; investigates possible improvements in MTS forecasting operations, and proposes a multiple time series based forecasting system. Time series considered are finite, linear, covariance stationary, and discrete. Specific objectives for the thesis were: (a) conducting comparative studies of MTS estimation methods; (b) investigating {{the effectiveness of}} <b>composite</b> <b>forecasts</b> in MTS analysis; (c) examining performance of process control procedures in MTS forecasting operations; and (d) proposing an overall approach to MTS estimation, model building and forecasting procedures. Multivariate exponential smoothing, multivariate Yule-Walker equations, and Chitturi's discounted least squares parameter estimation methods {{were used in the}} study. Time series schemes which are most suitable for using these estimation methods are multiple autoregressive processes, MAR(s,p); and mixed autoregressivemoving average processes, MARMA(s, 1, 1). Comparative studies were conducted on selected real economic time series. Outcomes of forecasting were measured in terms of weighted mean square errors. Computational efforts were recorded and compared. Proper data treatments were taken to ensure desired characteristics such as stationarity, and nonseasonality. The techniques of <b>composite</b> <b>forecasting</b> were studied and applied to MTS analysis. Performance of all four alternatives for <b>composite</b> <b>forecasts</b> were reviewed and favorable results were reported. In an effort to reduce computation expenses in MTS analysis, process control procedures were implemented. A trivariate MTS model was then used to demonstrate the application of process control procedures in MTS forecasting operations. An overall approach to MTS estimation, model building and forecasting procedure has been developed. It is a two-phase procedure. The estimation phase is a multi-variable analogue of the Box-Jenkins iterative process for model building in single time series analysis. Process control procedures and <b>composite</b> <b>forecasting</b> techniques are incorporated in the second phase.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{substantial}} research effort aimed to forecast futures price return volatilities of financial and commodity assets. Some {{part of this}} research focuses {{on the performance of}} time-series models (in particular ARCH models) versus option implied volatility models. A significant part of the literature related to this topic shows that volatility forecast accuracy is not easy to estimate regardless of the forecasting model applied. This paper examines the volatility accuracy of volatility forecast models for the case of corn and wheat futures price returns. The models applied here are a univariate GARCH, a multivariate ARCH (the BEKK model), an option implied and a <b>composite</b> <b>forecast</b> model. The <b>composite</b> model includes time-series (historical) and option implied volatility forecasts. The results show that the option implied model is superior to the historical models in terms of accuracy and that the <b>composite</b> <b>forecast</b> model was the most accurate one (compared to the alternative models) having the lowest mean-square-errors. Given these findings it is recommended to use a <b>composite</b> <b>forecast</b> model if both types of data are available i. e. the time-series (historical) and the option implied. In addition, the results of this paper are consistent to that part of the literature that emphasizes the difficulty on being accurate about forecasting asset price return volatility. This is because the explanatory power (coefficient of determination) calculated in the forecast regressions were relatively low.

A set of qualitative forecasts is evaluated using auxiliary logit models {{to predict the}} probability of each forecast's correctness.

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} {{accuracy}} of outlook hog price forecasts can be improved using <b>composite</b> <b>forecasts</b> in an out-of-sample context. Price forecasts from four wellrecognized outlook programs are combined with futures-based forecasts, ARIMA, and unrestricted Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models. Quarterly data are available from 1975. I through 2007. IV, which allow for a relatively long out-of-sample evaluation period after permitting model specification and appropriate composite-weight training periods. Results show that futures and numerous composite procedures outperform outlook forecasts. At intermediate horizons, OLS composite procedures perform rather well. The superiority of futures and <b>composite</b> <b>forecasts</b> decreases at longer horizons except for an equal-weighted approach. Importantly, with just few exceptions, nothing outperforms the equal-weight approach significantly in any program or horizon.

40|$|The {{contention}} {{advanced in}} this paper is that forecast performance could be improved if short-term commodity forecasters were to consider formally {{the use of a}} variety of forecasting methods, rather than seeking to improve one selected method.

Using a case study of two Bureau of Agricultural Economics' forecast series and alternative, time series model forecasts of the same series, four methods of deriving <b>composite</b> <b>forecasts</b> are applied on an ex ante basis and are thus evaluated as a means of improving the Bureau's forecast performance. Despite the fact that the authors could not, by combining the available forecasts, form a superior <b>composite</b> <b>forecast,</b> the application highlights the suitability of this approach for reviewing the performance of forecasting methods on a formal basis, and did prove useful in exposing weaknesses and strengths in BAE market information forecasts which otherwise would not have come to light.

The object {{of this study is to}} demonstrate that more consistent and reliable initial estimates of key hog supply and inventory categories can be generated by augmenting the survey-based Hogs and Pigs report estimates with market information. Two alternative pork sector econometric models with alternative expectation regimes are proposed as a relatively costless means to expand the information set on which the Hogs and Pigs report estimates are based;The first econometric model is dynamic and nonlinear and incorporates the rational expectation hypothesis with forward looking expectations. The second incorporates futures market price expectations. Breeding herd decisions of pork producers are based on distant closing futures prices of live hogs and corn. Both econometric models integrate restrictions based on the biological processes of pork production as prior information in their supply components;The market information from the two econometric models are synthesized in one-step ahead forecasts of key hog supply and inventory categories. These model-based forecasts are combined with the USDA initial estimates using alternative <b>composite</b> <b>forecasting</b> techniques. The results suggest that the inclusion of market information in the data evaluation and estimation procedures can reduce errors in the USDA initial estimates.
