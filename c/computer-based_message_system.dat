Many of today's electronic <b>messaging</b> <b>systems</b> have their own distinct merits and peculiarities. Pervasive messaging will have to shield the user from these differences. In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy for electronic <b>messaging</b> <b>systems,</b> providing a uniform way to analyze, compare, and discuss electronic <b>messaging</b> <b>systems.</b> With this taxonomy, we analyze the current practice, demonstrating its shortfalls. To overcome these shortfalls, we introduce a novel messaging model: The Unified <b>Messaging</b> <b>System.</b> This system can, in fact, mimic any electronic <b>messaging</b> <b>system,</b> thus providing powerful unified messaging...|$|R

40|$|Unifying user-to-user <b>messaging</b> <b>systems</b> is {{becoming}} popular as it allows message exchange independent of time, place, protocol, and end-user device. Building gateways to interconnect existing <b>messaging</b> <b>systems</b> seems an obvious approach to unification. We argue that unification {{should take place}} {{at the level of the}} underlying <b>messaging</b> <b>systems.</b> Such a unification results in one system delivering the same messaging services that all currently existing <b>messaging</b> <b>systems</b> deliver, as well as different combinations of those services that cannot be currently supported. We present a novel unifying <b>messaging</b> <b>system.</b> Our approach supports services such as offered by e-mail, fax, short messaging, instant messaging, netnews, and voicemail.
