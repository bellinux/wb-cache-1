Both isothermal heat treatments and a dynamic <b>crystal-pulling</b> <b>technique</b> were mployed. The crystalliza-tion took place by a dendritic or spherulitic mechanism, {{according to which}} of the crystal polymorphs i stable under the prevailing conditions. The morphology of the crystals i controlled by {{the ease with which}} the anionic groups present in the amorphous phase can be incor-porated into the growing crystals. This is reflected inthe values of the activation energies of crystal growth found for ~t-CaSiO 3 (I 6 o kJ mol- 1) and for fl-CaSiO 3 (M 9 to 383 kJ mol-x). The Keith and Padden theory of spheru-]itic crystallization was verified for the growth of fl-CaSiO 3 over a range of supercoolings. Time-tempera...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports a}} vacuum or space related effect, which is {{referred}} to as “cold welding”, “adhesion” or “sticking”. This effect is studied for bulk quasicrystal [1] versus different kinds of counterparts (steel, aluminium, titanium, hard metals). Full series of samples, prepared either by <b>crystal-pulling</b> <b>techniques</b> (single crystals) or by sintering (multi-grain samples) were analysed by fretting tests. Four alloy systems were investigated: Al-Pd-Mn, Al-Cr-Fe-B, Al-Cu-B and Al-Cu-Fe-B, with different crystallographic structures and nominal compositions. These materials, especially icosahedral phases, exhibit the absence of cold-welding in vacuum versus certain steels...|$|R
