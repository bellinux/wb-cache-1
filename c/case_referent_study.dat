40|$|In a <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>study</b> {{of about}} 600 cases of male lung cancer in {{northern}} Sweden the risk in professional drivers was specifically studied. Data concerning occupations, time {{and type of}} employment, and smoking habits were collected by questionnaires directed to close relatives. On average, professional drivers were heavier smokers {{and this was the}} chief cause of a slightly increased crude risk ratio in the study as a whole. Smoking drivers in an upper age group (70 and over) had a high relative risk of lung cancer, whereas in a lower age group (under 70) no significant increase was found. The relative risk in non-smoking drivers in the upper age group was moderately raised with borderline statistical significance. The high relative risk estimated for smoking drivers in the upper age group suggests a synergistic effect between smoking and occupational exposure...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} ways {{of establishing}} cause of death, assessing trends in mortality, and identifying {{factors that affect}} mortality and survival among the different population groups in rural and semi-urban Ethiopia. These data are important for health care planning; however, such vital data are unavailable in many developing countries. The {{study was conducted in}} Butajira Rural Health Program Demographic Surveillance Site, Ethiopia, where data collection on vital events and related research has been conducted for the last 20 years. This thesis used a cohort and a <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>study</b> preceded by Focus Group Discussion. It also employed a verbal autopsy procedure to identify causes of death. The cohort component used 18 years of surveillance data (1987 - 2004). The prospective <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>study,</b> carried out in the years 2003 - 2005, was used to complement the mortality analysis and focused particularly on issues related to household decision making, social capital, and economic status. The main subgroups included were children under-five years old, adults 15 - 64, and the elderly 65 years and above. Cause of death was ascertained using the Physicians’ Review and InterVA methods. Food shortage and epidemics affected the modest downward trend of mortality. There was a general similarity between the Physicians’ Review and InterVA methods in identifying the major causes of death. About 60 % of the deaths were due to pneumonia/sepsis, pulmonary tuberculosis, malaria, and diarrhoea disease/malnutrition. The InterVA method was cheaper and more consistent. Higher rates of HIV/AIDS (11 %), tuberculosis (18 %), and cardiovascular (9 %) mortality were noted in urban areas compared to rural areas. Consistent higher mortality was found in rural areas. Women were disadvantaged by residence and advanced age. Place of residence, illiteracy, widowhood, and not owning a house affected men and women differently, indicating a possible need for gender-specific interventions. Children and women survival is affected by household decision-making; this means efforts to improve women’s involvement in household decision-making (women empowerment) might improve child and women survival in poor settings. Many factors that significantly affect mortality can only be controlled by concerted efforts to improve health and overall development...|$|E
40|$|Mammography {{screening}} is {{the only}} method presently considered appropriate for mass screening of asymptomatic women. Its frequent use, however, warrants diligent analysis of potential side effects. Radiation risk is far below the natural yearly {{risk of breast cancer}} and should not be used as an argument against screening. False-positive calls lead to additional imaging or histopathological assessment, mainly percutaneous breast biopsy. These measures are tolerated and accepted fairly well. Their number is limited by strict quality assurance and constant training. Interval cancers represent a limitation of breast screening that should prompt further research for optimization. Evaluation of overdiagnosis is a highly debated topic in the literature. According to the probably most realistic available calculations, overdiagnosis is acceptable as it is compensated by the potential mortality reduction. Nonetheless, this potential side effect warrants optimal adjustment of therapy to the patient's individual risk. The mortality reduction seen in randomized studies was confirmed by results from national screening programs. A recent <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>study</b> indicated that improvements in mortality reduction run parallel to improved mammographic techniques. Use of less aggressive therapies is another valuable effect of screening. Awareness of potential problems, strict quality assurance, and further research should help to further develop screening programs...|$|E
40|$|Various cancer {{screening}} trials, randomised or otherwise controlled, have demonstrated reductions in cancer mortality. As a consequence, population screening programmes have been implemented. In the mean time, major advances {{are being made}} in early detection and treatment modalities of specific cancers and pre-cancers. The impact of these improvements should have bearing on the beneficial effect of periodical screening in preventing cancer death. To monitor these dynamics in the effectiveness of screening, case-referent studies are designed. The effectiveness is estimated by calculating an odds ratio indicating the cancer death rate in screened versus not screened invitees. The major criticisms of <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>studies</b> are potential selection bias and confounding bias of the odds ratio. By properly designing and applying sensitivity analyses these biases can be minimised...|$|R
40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{suggested}} that a relation may exist between exposure to occupational organic solvents and diseases of the kidney [...] particularly malignancy and glomerulonephritis. Two <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>studies</b> were undertaken in the West Midlands to investigate these possibilities. In the case of renal cancer 54 live cases of biopsy proved adenocarcinoma of the kidney were compared with an equal number of community based healthy referents matched for age, sex, place of residence, and socioeconomic and ethnic grouping. For glomerulonephritis, 50 biopsy proved cases were matched in the same manner with 50 referents. Fourteen other patients were also reviewed who, on biopsy, proved not to have glomerulonephritis. For both sets of <b>cases</b> and their <b>referents</b> each individual was interviewed and a detailed account obtained of medical history and environmental exposures. Exposure to solvents was assessed independently and "blind" in a semiquantitative way by an experienced occupational hygienist. Past exposure was estimated for 10 different solvent types and 17 material types. No relation was found between exposure to solvents and renal cancer or glomerulonephritis. In the case of renal cancer the numbers studied only precluded a fourfold excess risk. For glomerulonephritis, the study, although methodologically superior to most other published studies and of similar size, was of similar power to the renal cancer investigation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{argues that}} the use of the odds ratio {{parameter}} in epidemiology needs to be considered with a view to the specific study design and the types of exposure and disease data at hand. Frequently, the odds ratio measure is being used instead of the risk ratio or the incidence-proportion ratio in cohort studies or as an estimate for the incidence density ratio in case-referent studies. Therefore, the analyses of epidemiologic data have produced biased estimates and the presentation of results has been misleading. However, the odds ratio can be relinquished as an effect measure for these study designs; and, the application of the case base sampling approach permits the incidence ratio and difference measures to be estimated without any untenable assumptions. For the Poisson regression, the odds ratio is not a parameter of interest; only the risk or rate ratio and difference are relevant. For the conditional logistic regression in matched <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>studies,</b> the odds ratio remains useful, but only when it is interpreted as an estimate of the incidence density ratio. Thus the odds ratio should, in general, give way to the incidence ratio and difference as the measures of choice for exposure effect in epidemiology...|$|R
40|$|Background Studies of {{occupational}} acute mountain sickness (AMS) have {{not focused on}} the more severe {{end of the spectrum}} to date. Aims To examine risk factors associated with the development {{of occupational}} AMS severe enough to receive treatment in a compression chamber. Methods A nested <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>study</b> in a cohort of high-altitude (4000 m) mine workers, comparing cases of severe, chamber-treated AMS to matched referents. Using logistic regression, we tested potential risk factors based on premorbid surveillance examinations, including cigarette smoking (current smoking, smoking intensity and exhaled carbon monoxide [CO]). Results There were 15 cases and 30 controls. In multivariate analysis including age, sex and place of resi-dence, current smoking was associated with increased risk of severe AMS (odds ratio [OR] 10. 0; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 5 – 67. 4), taking into account any prior, less severe AMS event, which was also a potent risk factor (OR 33. 3; 95 % CI 2. 8 – 390). Smoking intensity (cigarettes per day) and exhaled CO were also statistically significantly associated with severe AMS. Conclusions Cigarette smoking is a strong, previously under-appreciated risk factor for severe AMS.

40|$|The work {{started with}} the {{clinical}} observations in patients working in buildings with indoor air problems. Signs of seborrhoeic dermatitis, erythematous facial skin conditions and itching conditions on the trunk were noted. Another point of departure was the attribution of facial skin symptoms to VDT work by patients. A questionnaire-based prevalence study of symptoms compatible with the Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) and facial skin symptoms in 4, 943 office workers {{formed the basis for}} two case referent studies, one focusing on SBS, the other on facial skin symptoms in VDT workers. The prevalence of SBS was three times higher in women than men. The prevalence was higher in young persons and in atopies. Facial skin symptoms showed the same pattern. Psychosocial work load, paper and VDT work were also risk indicators for SBS and for skin symptoms. The symptom excess in women was analyzed with reference to differences in biological or acquired risks and different illness and reporting behaviour. In spite of inequalities in social conditions at home and at work and differences in physical working conditions, these differences could only explain {{a small part of the}} gender difference. The odds ratio for SBS in women was lowered from 3. 4 in the crude analysis to 3. 0 in the multivariate analysis. Effect modification was in most cases stronger in men and the clinical validation of the questionnaire refuted the hypothesis that women over-report symptoms. The results indicate that the gender difference in symptom prevalence is part of a general pattem common to psychosomatic illnesses. In the <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>study</b> of SBS, atopy, psychosocial work load, buildings built or renovated after 1977, the presence of photocopiers and a low outdoor air flow rate were risk indicators. The association between air quality and the occurrence of SBS symptoms was demonstrated by a flow-response relation between the outdoor air flow rate and SBS symptoms. In the <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>study</b> of skin symptoms in VDT work, psychosocial work load, electric background fields, the presence of fluorescent lights with plastic shields and low cleaning frequency were risk indicators. The clinical findings in the two case groups and their referents supported the applied relevance of the studies. Compared with the referents, the SBS cases had more work- related facial erythema, seborriioeic dermatitis and general pruritus, while skin symptom cases, had more work-related facial erythema than their referents. The results show that SBS symptoms and facial skin symptoms have a multifactorial background with constitutional, psychosocial and physical risk indicators. As the indoor air quality is a determinant of SBS symptoms, and the building itself is but one source of indoor air pollution, it is suggested that the name Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) be replaced by Indoor Air Syndrome (IAS).

40|$|Aims: To {{assess whether}} cancer {{incidence}} and mortality in chronic obstructive lung diseases were {{increased in the}} Swedish polyurethane foam industry cohort, updated with 11 more years of follow up. Methods: The mortality and cancer incidence (1959 – 98) experienced by a cohort of 4175 male and female employees employed {{for at least one}} year in the period 1959 – 87 at one of nine Swedish polyurethane foaming plants were investigated. Comparisons were based on calendar year, sex, and five-year age group specific mortality and incidence rates for Sweden. Workplaces and job tasks were categorically assessed for exposure to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyldiisocyanate (MDI) by occupational hygienists. Results: Fewer cancer cases than expected were observed, but the lung cancer incidence was enhanced in women. Women with "apparent exposure" to TDI or MDI did not, however, have a higher lung cancer incidence than those with "no or low exposure". Moreover, a nested <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>study</b> did not find that polyurethane dust exposure had been more prevalent among the female lung cancer cases than among referents. No increased mortality in chronic obstructive lung diseases was observed in the cohort. Conclusions: Results support the findings from two other cohort studies of an increased lung cancer risk among female workers in the polyurethane foam manufacturing industry. Chance or confounding from smoking are not obvious explanations for the coherent findings. However, the study was not able to link isocyanate exposed employment with lung cancer risk...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure to cotton {{is known}} to produce a {{specific}} occupational disease known as byssinosis. A large population of textile workers was investigated to determine whether such exposure was also associated with chronic bronchitis once other possible aetiological factors had been accounted for. METHODS: A total of 2991 workers were investigated {{for the presence of}} symptoms compatible with chronic bronchitis. An MRC adapted respiratory questionnaire and MRC definition of chronic bronchitis were used for diagnostic labelling. Current and lifetime exposure to dust was estimated by personal and work area sampling, and the use of records of retrospective dust levels previously measured over the preceding 10 years. Airborne endotoxin exposure was measured using a quantitative turbidometric assay. Lung function tests were performed to measure forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). A control group of workers exposed to man-made fibre textiles was identified. The comparative prevalence of chronic bronchitis in the two populations was assessed, allowing for sex, age, smoking habit, and ethnic origin. Two <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>studies</b> were also performed; cases of chronic bronchitis were separately matched with controls from the cotton and control populations to determine the effect of the symptomatic state on lung function. RESULTS: After controlling for smoking (pack years), workers in a cotton environment {{were significantly more likely to}} suffer from chronic bronchitis and this was most marked in workers over 45 years of age (odds ratio 2. 51 (CI 1. 3 to 4. 9); p < 0. 01). Regression analysis of all possible influencing parameters showed that cumulative exposure to cotton dust was significantly associated with chronic bronchitis after the effects of age, sex, smoking, and ethnic group were accounted for (p < 0. 0005). In the intra-cotton population case control study a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis was associated with a small decrement in lung function compared with controls: percentage predicted FEV 1 in cases 81. 4 % (95 % CI 78. 3 to 84. 6), controls 86. 7 % (84. 9 to 88. 5); FVC in cases 89. 9 % (95 % CI 87. 0 to 92. 9), controls 94. 6 % (92. 8 to 96. 4). After controlling for cumulative past exposure and pack years of smoking the effect of the diagnostic state remained significant for both FEV 1 (p < 0. 01) and FVC (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic bronchitis is more prevalent in cotton workers than in those working with man-made fibre and exposure is additive to the effect of smoking. The diagnosis of chronic bronchitis is associated with a small but significant decrement in lung function. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Public health {{research}} characterising {{the course of}} life through the middle age in developing societies is scarce. The {{aim of this study}} is to explore patterns of adult (15 – 64 years) mortality in an Ethiopian population over time, by gender, urban or rural lifestyle, causes of death and in relation to household economic status and decision-making. Methods The study was conducted in Butajira Demographic Surveillance Site (DSS) in south-central Ethiopia among adults 15 – 64 years old. Cohort analysis of surveillance data was conducted for the years 1987 – 2004 complemented by a prospective case-referent (case control) study over two years. Rate ratios were computed to assess the relationships between mortality and background variables using a Poisson regression model. In the case-referent component, odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) were used to assess the effect of certain risk factors that were not included in the surveillance system. Results A total of 367 940 person years were observed in a period of 18 years, in which 2 860 deaths occurred. One hundred sixty two cases and 486 matched for age, sex and place of residence controls were included in the <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> (<b>case</b> control) <b>study.</b> Only a modest downward trend in adult mortality was seen over the 18 year period. Rural lifestyle carried a significant survival disadvantage [mortality rate ratio 1. 62 (95 % CI 1. 44 to 1. 82), adjusted for gender, period and age group], while the overall effects of gender were negligible. Communicable disease mortality was appreciably higher in rural areas [rate ratio 2. 05 (95 % CI 1. 73 to 2. 44), adjusted for gender, age group and period]. Higher mortality was associated with a lack of literacy in a household, poor economic status and lack of women's decision making. Conclusion A complex pattern of adult mortality prevails, still influenced by war, famine and communicable diseases. Individual factors such as a lack of education, low economic status and social disadvantage all contribute to increased risks of mortality. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{infections and}} {{associated}} inflammatory markers are suggested {{risk factors for}} cardiovascular disease (CVD). The proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL) - 1 β, is suggested {{to play a role}} in the regulation of local inflammatory responses in both CVD and periodontitis. The leukotoxin from the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has recently been shown to cause abundant secretion of IL- 1 β from macrophages. The aim of the present study was to compare the prevalence of systemic immunoreactivity to A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin in myocardial infarction (MI) cases (n = 532) and matched controls (n = 1, 000) in a population-based <b>case</b> and <b>referents</b> <b>study</b> in northern Sweden. Methods Capacity to neutralize A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin was analyzed in a bioassay with leukocytes, purified leukotoxin, and plasma. Plasma samples that inhibited lactate-dehydrogenase release from leukotoxin-lysed cells by ≥ 50 % were classified as positive. Results Neutralizing capacity against A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin was detected in 53. 3 % of the plasma samples. The ability to neutralize leukotoxin was correlated to increasing age in men (n = 1, 082) but not in women (n = 450). There was no correlation between presence of systemic leukotoxin-neutralization capacity and the incidence of MI, except for women (n = 146). Women with a low neutralizing capacity had a significantly higher incidence of MI than those who had a high neutralizing capacity. Conclusion Systemic immunoreactivity against A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin was found at a high prevalence in the analyzed population of adults from northern Sweden. The results from the present study do not support the hypothesis that systemic leukotoxin-neutralizing capacity can decrease the risk for MI. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES—The {{aim of this}} <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>study</b> was to {{investigate}} the relation between physical workload and osteoarthrosis of the hip in women.  METHODS—The study base comprised all women of ages 50 - 70  years, living in five counties and four towns in Sweden 1991 - 1994.  Cases (n= 230), who had undergone total hip replacement for primary osteoarthrosis of the hip were identified by means of the Swedish National Register of Total Hip Replacements, and the referents (n= 273) were women without hip problems randomly selected from the study base. All women were interviewed about state of health, smoking habits, occupational history, work in the home, sports activities, etc. Each subject's history of occupational work and work in the home up to the age of 50  was divided into periods within each of which the work tasks were similar, and a questionnaire for each such period was filled in by the participants. On the basis of information given by the referents, the women were classified as having had low, medium, and high exposure to different factors. Relative risks (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.  RESULTS—Physically demanding tasks at work and in the home were associated with increased RRs of osteoarthrosis of the hip in those with high exposure compared with the low exposure group. A RR in the range of 2  or higher was found for those who frequently jumped or moved between different levels (RR= 2. 1, CI 1. 9,  4. 2), who frequently climbed stairs (RR= 2. 1, CI 1. 2,  3. 6), and who had physically demanding tasks outside occupational life (RR= 2. 3, CI 1. 5,  3. 6). The highest RR (RR= 4. 3, CI 1. 7,  11. 0) was found for those exposed to high physical loads both at work and during sports activities.  CONCLUSION—High physical loads at work and in the home up to the age of 50  seem to be risk factors for development of severe osteoarthrosis of the hip in women. ...|$|E
40|$|Within {{a defined}} {{geographical}} area, all patients, 192 in total, with insulin- dependent diabetes {{of at least}} 2 years' duration and free from long-term diabetic complications were identified. Their experiences {{of the influence of}} the disease on daily living, tedium, and smoking habits were evaluated using a questionnaire and related to metabolic control. A case-referent study concerning smoking habits among 25 patients with good, and 25 with poor metabolic control was performed. The influence of mentruation on metabolic control was studied among 20 diabetic women and 20 healthy controls. Coping strategies and their outcomes were studied among 20 patients, using the interview technique. Among those with unsatifactory metabolic and/or emotional outcomes, plans for nursing intervention were agreed on, using diagnostic reasoning. Only a minority of the patients reported that the disease caused them considerable problems in their daily lives. The greatest problems occurred in connection with regularity in daily life, diet management, and exercise. Patients with good metabolic control (HbAic 9. 0) reported more often that they were smokers (pcO. Ol) and the women fertile aged in this group more often reported problems with metabolic control during menstruation (p< 0. 05). Twenty-nine (18 %) were defined as suffering from tedium. There was a higher proportion (NS) of high tedium scores among patients in both good and poor metabolic control groups than in those with intermediate metabolic control. Sixty (31 %) of the patients were smokers, prevalence of smoking increased significantly with increasing HbAic- levels (17. 5 % among patients with the best metabolic control, 47. 5 % among those with the worst metabolic control). In the <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>study</b> exposure to smoking was found to be significantly more common among those with poor control (odds ratio 6. 0). No systematic change in metabolic control during the menstrual cycle could be found. Problem-solving coping strategy based on the monitoring of blood glucose in combination with sensitivity to signs of actual blood glucose level and logical reasoning, was found to have the best coping outcome, both regarding metabolic control and well-being.

40|$|Epidemics of a permanent, non-progressive spastic {{paraparesis}} with sudden onset hasbeen reported from several {{rural areas of}} sub-Saharan Africa. Studies in East Africasuggested an association with dietary cyanide intake from unprocessed cassava. InZaire the disease was attributed to an infectious cause as the cyanogenic glucosides inthe cassava consumed {{were known to be}} removed by traditional soaking. The aims ofthe thesis were to define the disease entity and elucidate its etiology. A communitybasedsurvey in rural Zaire identified 110 live and 24 dead cases among 6764 inhabitants (16 / 1000). The clinical findings were identical to earlier studies and it wasdecided to name the disease konzo as in the first known report. Annual and monthlyincidence of konzo was associated with almost exclusive consumption of shortsoakedbitter cassava roots. The appearence of konzo coincided with the completionof a tarmac road from the capital, which turned cassava into the main cash crop, andinduced short-cuts in the processing. A processing experiment showed that flour fromshort-soaked roots was high in cyanogens. A higher cyanide intake in affectedcompared to un-affected populations was confirmed by much higher urinarythiocyanate levels, the main metabolite. A low urinary sulphate indicated lowavailability of sulphur, the substrate for detoxification. All three konzo patientsexamined at onset had blood cyanide levels above 4 Ilmolll, versus only 2 out of 23 controls (p<O. Ol). This supports an etiological role for cyanide. An odds ratio of 11 was found for short-soaking of cassava, in a multivariate logistic regression analysis ofa <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>study</b> in Zaire, with a dose-response curve indicating higher risk ofkonzo with frequent consumption of short-soaked cassava. Serological investigationsof 33 cases in Zaire excluded retrovirus etiology for konzo. Konzo was also identifiedin low prevalence in the Central African Republic, again associated with consumptionof insufficiently processed cassava. Investigation in Sweden of two severely disabledTanzanian patients revealed normal magnetic resonance imaging but neurophysiologyshowed isolated upper motor neuron dysfunction. This is consistent with clinicalfindings and identifies konzo as a distinct disease entity. The evidence for anetiological role of high cyanide and low sulphur intake in konzo is now strongenough to urge for prevention by promotion of efficient processing of cassava roots...|$|E

Also, sex distribution of children has been investigated as a possible risk indicator in some recent studies.

Personal interview of the worker is an important source of information, although recall problems may weaken the quality of the data.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{increase}} {{our knowledge of the}} physical environment of office workers with special focus on electromagnetic fields and to address the question of whether electromagnetic fields can directly or indirectly contribute to symptoms or discomfort among video display terminal (VDT) workers. Furthermore, we have measured light modulation from various commonly used light sources in laboratory conditions and, as a second step, used modulated light as stimulus for provocation of neurophysiological responses in persons with perceived “electrical hypersensitivity” (EHS). During the last 20 years work-related illness among office workers has received increased attention. Changes in the physical environment, the introduction of VDTs and other electrical equipment and changes in light conditions have been discussed in this context. The basis for this thesis is the interdisciplinary Office Illness Project in Northern Sweden. Using a questionnaire completed by 4, 943 office workers, 150 VDT workers with or without facial skin symptoms were selected for a <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>study</b> of the electromagnetic fields in offices. When the measurements in the offices were performed in 1989, the general level of the 50 Hz magnetic fields in the offices was rather low, but in 5 % of the offices the flux density exceeded 0. 5 pT. At this level VDT monitors were shown to display detectable instability (jitter). Furthermore, the ability of test subjects (healthy volunteers) to detect jitter was shown to depend on both the amplitude and frequency characteristics of this instability. The study indicates that the instability of computer monitors and thereby the instability of the visual image of the VDT screen might be an increasing problem since it is known that the harmonic content of the general magnetic field in offices is on the rise. VDT monitors contributed to the magnetic field level at VDT workplaces in both extremely low and very low frequency ranges. However, the dominant source of electric fields in rooms was ungrounded electrical equipment, not VDT screens. High electric fields in the extremely low frequency range in the offices were associated with skin symptoms among VDT workers. The causal nature of this association cannot be determined since it may depend on undetected factors related to exposure. No associations were found, however, for any of the VDT-related electromagnetic fields and skin symptoms. Commonly used fluorescent tubes in our office environment have a degree of modulation of the light (flicker) that varies widely from less than 1 % (fluorescent tubes with high frequency gear) up to nearly 100 %. When persons with perceived EHS were exposed to flickering light, a higher amplitude of brain cortex responses were found at all tested frequencies compared with control subjects. These findings are of considerable interest, but further studies are required in order to establish a possible relationship between flickering light and discomfort/symptoms in persons with perceived EHS. digitalisering@um...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Background Preeclampsia affects about 5 to 10 % of all pregnancies and eclamptic seizure {{is one of}} its serious complications. In many {{developing}} countries including Tanzania, maternal and perinatal mortality due to eclampsia are high. As yet, primary prevention of eclampsia is not possible since the causes are largely unknown. Headache, visual disturbance, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting have been reported by various studies to precede most eclamptic seizures; thus could be used to predict and therefore prevent some cases given the availability of magnesium sulphate. These symptoms however are also common in normal pregnancy and post delivery mothers due to physiological changes of pregnancy and common disease conditions that usually affect pregnant women in our settings. The present study evaluated the characteristics of symptoms that are consistent with imminence of eclampsia Methodology This was a <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>study</b> in which 123 eclamptic and 123 non eclamptic mothers that best matched in terms of age, parity, gestation age and delivery were enrolled, making a total of 246 women. The presence and characteristics of headache, visual disturbance, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting were enquired. A 4 grade scale was used to grade the severity of headache. In the rest of symptoms, common presenting features were utilized. vii Results Headache was common in both groups but was more frequent in eclamptic than in referent group of women (88 % vs. 43 %, p < 0. 001). In eclamptic mothers headache was mainly severe, frontal and most of the seizures happened within one week of the onset of headache, as compared to referent women where headache was mostly mild and either frontal or generalized. Visual problems were significantly frequent in eclamptics than in referent women, (39 % vs. 3 % p< 0. 001). Of the eclamptic mothers who presented with visual problems, 45 (94 %) had blurring of vision, 32 (67 %) had blind spots, 10 (21 %) had photophobia and only 7 (15 %) had total blindness. A total of 47 (98 %) of eclamptic mothers developed seizures within 12 hours of the onset of visual problems. The frequency of abdominal pain was not significantly different between eclamptic and referent mothers (47 % vs. 38 % p= 0. 156), however upper quadrant abdominal pain was significantly reported in eclamptic than in referent group of women (36 % vs. 9 %, p= 0. 001). There was no significant difference on the type of abdominal pain presented by both groups. Nausea was common in both eclamptics and referent group of women (60 % vs. 54 %, p= 0. 303). There was no difference on presentation with vomiting among eclamptic and referent women (62 % vs. 68 % p= 0. 516) and in both groups the type of vomiting was commonly non projectile. Conclusion This study has revealed that headache, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting are common to pregnancy whether or not complicated by preeclampsia/eclampsia. The characteristics of headache, visual disturbances and abdominal pain differ between eclamptics and viii women without preeclampsia/eclampsia. In a pre eclamptic woman, an onset of a severe frontal headache or upper quadrant abdominal pain would suggest an occurrence of seizures within one week. Visual disturbance is the most ominous sign as seizures ensue within 12 hours of its onset. Nausea and vomiting cannot be reliably used to predict eclampsia...|$|E
40|$|Objective The {{prevalence}} of obesity and related diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) is increasing worldwide, and the Asian Indian population seems to be particularly susceptible to developing T 2 DM, even at a low body mass index (BMI). In Sweden, the age-adjusted {{prevalence of}} diabetes has not increased despite increasing self-reported obesity. However, modern data on the {{prevalence of obesity}} and T 2 DM in Scandinavia are absent. The biochemical links between obesity and subsequent T 2 DM are unknown, but the adipocyte-derived hormones leptin and adiponectin (adipokines) have been suggested as potential links because they both are related to insulin and glucose physiology. Some studies have found leptin to be an independent predictor of T 2 DM in men but not in women, although these results are inconsistent. In contrast, adiponectin has more consistently been linked to development of T 2 DM in both men and women. Furthermore, the leptin–adiponectin ratio may predict incident T 2 DM better than {{either of the two}} hormones separately. The aims of this thesis were to describe time trends in obesity and T 2 DM in northern Sweden, to evaluate leptin and adiponectin as predictors of deterioration in glucose metabolism including T 2 DM, and to evaluate leptin as a risk marker regarding ethnic differences, circ-annual variation, and intra-individual stability. Materials and methods Three large population surveys were used, the Northern Sweden MONICA (MONitoring of Trends and Determinants in CArdiovascular Disease) study, the Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP), and the Mauritius Non-Communicable Disease Study. Within the MONICA study, six cross-sectional surveys were performed in Sweden’s two northernmost counties, Norrbotten and Västerbotten, between 1986 and 2009. A total of 1000 men and 1000 women ages 25 – 64 years, also including from 1994 250 men and 250 women ages 65 – 74 years, were independently chosen for each survey. The overall participation rate was 75 %. In 1999, a reinvestigation was performed in 74 % of all participants from the three first surveys. Data from the MONICA surveys were used in papers I and IV and data from the reinvestigation survey in paper II. VIP is an ongoing population intervention program that started in the mid-eighties targeting cardiovascular risk factors and has covered the whole county of Västerbotten since 1991. Inhabitants are invited the years they turn 40, 50, and 60 years old, and the annual participation rate has varied between 48 % and 67 %. A subset (n= 1780) from VIP was used in paper II for the circ-annual leptin analysis, and VIP data linked to the diabetes register in Västerbotten (DiabNorr) were used in a <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> <b>study</b> (640 patients with T 2 DM) in paper III. The Mauritius Non-Communicable Disease Study was performed in 1987 in 10 randomly selected (with probability proportional to size) population clusters. All eligible adults ages 25 – 74 years were invited, and the participation rate was 86 % (n= 5083). In 1992, a follow-up survey was performed in 49 % of the initial participants. The Mauritius survey data were used in paper II. Results I. BMI increased in men ages 25 – 74 years and in women ages 25 – 44 years in northern Sweden between 1986 and 2004. The prevalence of obesity (BMI 30) increased in men ages 25 – 44 and 55 – 74 years and in women ages 25 – 44 years. The prevalence of obesity increased from 10. 4 % to 19. 1 % in men and from 12. 9 % to 17. 9 % in women ages 25 – 64 years. Waist circumference (WC) decreased in women of all ages and in men ages 55 – 64 years between 1986 and 1990. After 1990, WC increased again, and the prevalence of abdominal obesity rose markedly in women ages 25 – 64 years. II. Differences in circulating levels of leptin, leptin per BMI unit (leptin/BMI), and leptin per cm in WC (leptin/waist) were tested in men and women of Asian Indian, Creole (African), and Caucasian ethnicity. Asian Indian men and women had the highest leptin concentrations and Caucasian men and women the lowest while Creole men and women had intermediate values for leptin, leptin/BMI, and leptin/waist. No circ-annual variation in leptin concentrations was seen in Caucasians. The intra-individual test– retest stability for leptin was equal in men and women of different ethnicities, over 5 – 13 years, with an intra-class correlation of 0. 65 – 0. 82. III. High adiponectin concentrations predicted decreased risk of T 2 DM in both insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant men and women, whereas high leptin levels predicted increased risk for T 2 DM only in insulinsensitive men. A high leptin–adiponectin ratio predicted T 2 DM in both men and women, and men with a high ratio had a shorter time to diagnosis than those with a low ratio. IV. In northern Sweden, fasting and post-load glucose increased in women ages 24 – 65 years with 0. 2 mmol/l and 0. 7 mmol/l, respectively, between 1990 and 2009. Consequently, the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) rose from 4. 5 % to 7. 7 %, and from 7. 8 % to 14. 5 %, respectively. In men, post-load glucose increased at 0. 5 mmol/l, and the prevalence of IGT rose from 3. 5 % to 10. 1 %. The prevalence of diabetes did not increase. An independent relationship between leptin and changes in fasting and post-load glucose was seen in men but not in women. Conclusion An increasing obesity and concomitant deterioration in glucose metabolism was seen in northern Sweden in the period studied. High adiponectin concentrations predicted a decreased risk of T 2 DM in both men and women, whereas high leptin concentrations predicted an increase in fasting and post-load glucose as well as an increased risk of T 2 DM in men but not in women. Individual insulin resistance status modified the association between leptin and T 2 DM, and the leptin–adiponectin ratio may add further predictive information beyond the measures of the separate hormones. In relation to traditional anthropometric measures of obesity, Asian Indian men and women had the highest and Caucasians the lowest concentrations of leptin while Creole (African) men and women had intermediate levels. As a risk marker, leptin has a high intra-individual stability, equal in men and women and among different ethnicities over 5 – 13 years with no circ-annual variation...|$|E

40|$|This study reassesses the {{relations}} between exam-related cheating behavior and its antecedents proposed in Smith et al. ’s (2009) Motivation and Cheating Model. Specifically, it calculates whether the significant relations measured in the <b>referent</b> <b>study</b> among motivational factors, academic performance, prior cheating, neutralization tendencies, and likelihood of future cheating, hold with an independent undergraduate student sample. By doing so, this study directly addresses Stout and Rebele’s (1996. pp. 4 - 5) admonition that knowledge is created by producing generalizable findings which cannot be accomplished in a single study. Subsequent analyses extend the referent model by incorporating alienation as an additional exogenous cheating antecedent. The premise for {{this aspect of the}} investigation is that both motivation and attitude, the latter represented by alienation and neutralization, may contribute toward the cheating behavior dynamic. Using structural equation modeling procedures on data obtained from 342 finance majors at three public AACSB-accredited business schools, we conduct independent 1 2 Smith, Derrick, and Manakyan assessments of the validity of the referent model and the extended model which incorporated alienation as an exogenous predictor of the above-referenced dependent constructs. The replication results support several of the significant relations uncovered in the <b>referent</b> <b>study.</b> The extension supports the conceptual distinctiveness of the motivation and alienation constructs, as well as the proposition that both are significant exogenous predictors of performance and cheating proclivities...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the second in}} a series of three parallel cohort studies of asbestos factories in South Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut to assess the effects of mineral fibre type and industrial process on mortality from malignant mesothelioma, respiratory cancer, and asbestosis. In the present plant (in Pennsylvania) mainly chrysotile, with some amosite and a small amount of crocidolite, were used primarily in textile manufacture. Of a cohort of 4137 men comprising all those employed 1938 - 59 for at least a month, 97 % were traced. By the end of 1974, 1400 (35 %) had died, 74 from asbestosis and 70 from lung cancer. Mesothelioma was mentioned on the certificate in 14 deaths mostly coded to other causes. All these deaths occurred after 1959, and there were indications that additional cases of mesothelioma may have gone unrecognised, especially before that date. The exposure for each man was estimated in terms of duration and dust concentration in millions of dust particles per cubic foot (mpcf) from available measurements. Analyses were made both by life table and <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> methods. The standardised mortality ratio for respiratory cancer for the whole cohort was 105. 0, but the risk rose linearly from 66. 9 for men with less than 10 mpcf. y to 416. 1 for those with 80 mpcf. y or more. Lines fitted to relative risks derived from SMRs in this and the textile plant studied in South Carolina were almost identical in slope. This was confirmed by <b>case</b> <b>referent</b> analysis. These findings support the conclusion from the South Carolina study that the risk of lung cancer in textile processing is very much greater than in chrysotile production and probably than in the friction products industry. The much greater risk of mesothelioma from exposure to processes in which even quite small quantities of amphiboles were used was also confirmed...|$|R
