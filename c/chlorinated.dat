5|$|Chlorine {{is usually}} used (in {{the form of}} hypochlorous acid) to kill {{bacteria}} and other microbes in drinking water supplies and public swimming pools. In most private swimming pools, chlorine itself is not used, but rather sodium hypochlorite, formed from chlorine and sodium hydroxide, or solid tablets of <b>chlorinated</b> isocyanurates. The drawback of using chlorine in swimming pools is that the chlorine reacts with the proteins in human hair and skin (see Hypochlorous acid), and becomes chemically bonded. Even small water supplies are now routinely <b>chlorinated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{organochlorine}} compounds {{have been}} isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans. <b>Chlorinated</b> organic compounds {{are found in}} nearly every class of biomolecules including alkaloids, terpenes, amino acids, flavonoids, steroids, and fatty acids. Organochlorides, including dioxins, are produced in the high temperature environment of forest fires, and dioxins {{have been found in}} the preserved ashes of lightning-ignited fires that predate synthetic dioxins. In addition, a variety of simple <b>chlorinated</b> hydrocarbons including dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride have been isolated from marine algae. A majority of the chloromethane in the environment is produced naturally by biological decomposition, forest fires, and volcanoes.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena vitilis contain the <b>chlorinated</b> {{compound}} strobilurinB.

5000|$|Although it {{does not}} pose a health hazard, Hanford's {{drinking}} water also naturally contains hydrogen sulfide, which caused the water to have a noticeable [...] "rotten egg" [...] odor. In 2014, the city began <b>chlorinating</b> its water for the first time, which eliminates the hydrogen sulfide odor.

5|$|In {{the form}} of {{chloride}} ions, chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced <b>chlorinated</b> organics range from inert to toxic. In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing organic molecules such as chlorofluorocarbons have been implicated in ozone depletion. Small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite in neutrophils {{as part of the}} immune response against bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{chloride}} is {{by a huge}} margin {{the most}} common chlorine compound, {{and it is the}} main source of chlorine and hydrochloric acid for the enormous chlorine-chemicals industry today. About 15000 chlorine-containing compounds are commercially traded, including such diverse compounds as <b>chlorinated</b> methanes and ethanes, vinyl chloride and its polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC), aluminium trichloride for catalysis, the chlorides of magnesium, titanium, zirconium, and hafnium which are the precursors for producing the pure elements, and so on.|$|E
5|$|The city draws {{its water}} supply from the Kiskatinaw River, 18km (11mi) west of town. Before {{reaching}} the city, {{the water is}} pumped through a settling pond, two storage ponds, and a treatment plant where it is flocculated, filtered, and <b>chlorinated.</b> The city also provides drinking water for Pouce Coupe and rural residents. Sewage is processed by a lagoon system east of town and released into the Pouce Coupe River.|$|E

5|$|Much later, during World War I in 1916, a {{standardized}} and diluted modification of Labarraque's solution containing hypochlorite (0.5%) and boric acid as an acidic stabilizer, {{was developed by}} Henry Drysdale Dakin (who gave full credit to Labarraque's prior work in this area). Called Dakin's solution, the method of wound irrigation with <b>chlorinated</b> solutions allowed antiseptic treatment {{of a wide variety}} of open wounds, long before the modern antibiotic era. A modified version of this solution continues to be employed in wound irrigation in modern times, where it remains effective against bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics (see Century Pharmaceuticals).|$|E
5|$|Quantitatively, of all {{elemental}} chlorine produced, about 63% {{is used in}} the manufacture of organic compounds, and 18% in the manufacture of inorganic chlorine compounds. About 15,000 chlorine compounds are used commercially. The remaining 19% of chlorine produced is used for bleaches and disinfection products. The most significant of organic compounds in terms of production volume are 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, intermediates in the production of PVC. Other particularly important organochlorines are methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, vinylidene chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes, and trichlorobenzenes. The major inorganic compounds include HCl, Cl2O, HOCl, NaClO3, <b>chlorinated</b> isocyanurates, AlCl3, SiCl4, SnCl4, PCl3, PCl5, POCl3, AsCl3, SbCl3, SbCl5, BiCl3, S2Cl2, SCl2, SOCI2, ClF3, ICl, ICl3, TiCl3, TiCl4, MoCl5, FeCl3, ZnCl2, and so on.|$|E
5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be <b>chlorinated</b> under {{free radical}} conditions, with UV light. However, {{the extent of}} {{chlorination}} is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and {{do not have to be}} distilled out.|$|E

5|$|O'Brien {{grew up in}} {{the rural}} town of Wellington, 360 {{kilometres}} (225 miles) from Sydney. Neither of his parents were skilled swimmers. His father Roy knew only one swimming stroke—the breaststroke—and his mother Thelma did not take her first swimming lesson until she was 55. O'Brien's sister Ann was a talented swimmer in her childhood years, but she preferred horseback riding. The local pool was an old-style facility that had no pump system and was only manually drained once a week. Aged four, O'Brien got his first swimming lessons from the local Learn to Swim program. There were not many non-sporting activities for children in Wellington, and O'Brien played basketball and rugby league, did athletics and swimming, and rode horses. In 1954, a <b>chlorinated</b> pool was built in the town, leading to the formation of Wellington Swimming Club. At the age of 10, O'Brien began competitive swimming under local coach Bert Eslick, and raced in regional country swimming carnivals at Dubbo, Bathurst and Orange.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorinated</b> Polyethylene (PE-C) is an {{inexpensive}} material having a chlorine content from 34 to 44%. It {{is used in}} blends with PVC because the soft, rubbery chloropolyethylene {{is embedded in the}} PVC matrix, thereby increasing the impact resistance. In addition, it also increases the weather resistance. Furthermore, it is used for softening PVC foils, without risking the migrate of plasticizers. <b>Chlorinated</b> polyethylene can be crosslinked peroxidically to form an elastomer which is used in cable and rubber industry. When <b>chlorinated</b> polyethylene is added to other polyolefins, it reduces the flammability.|$|E

25|$|Dioxins are absorbed {{primarily}} through dietary intake of fat, {{as this is}} where they accumulate in animals and humans. In humans, the highly <b>chlorinated</b> dioxins are stored in fatty tissues and are neither readily metabolized nor excreted.
