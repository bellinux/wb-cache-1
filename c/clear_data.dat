40|$|The {{analysis}} of a scintillation database recorded at British Telecom's Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station between February 1988 and August 1990 is described. The signal frequency is 11. 198 GHz and the slant path elevation angle is 3. 3 °. The objective of this analysis is {{to determine if the}} CCIR 1990 scintillation model is applicable at a 3. 3 ° elevation angle. The database is pre-processed to yield clear sky (or dry) and degraded sky (or wet) subsets. Algorithms to calculate the predicted and measured scintillation standard deviations and CDF (cumulative distribution function) of fades are developed. The CCIR scintillation model is found to overpredict the average-year monthly standard deviation of the <b>clear</b> sky <b>data.</b> A new reference standard deviation is then derived using the <b>clear</b> sky <b>data.</b> The modified model fits the <b>clear</b> sky <b>data</b> well, but underpredicts the degraded sky scintillation.

5000|$|Paleoneurobiology {{revolves}} around the analysis of endocasts. Much of this analysis is focused on interpreting sulcal patterns, which is difficult because traces are often hardly recognizable, {{and there are no}} clear landmarks to use as reference points.

Since the obtaining of <b>clear</b> <b>data</b> from fossil details is usually very difficult, much debate arises over interpretations. Experience is often an important factor in endocast analysis.

50|$|Although the {{physical}} market for {{gold and silver}} is distributed globally, most wholesale OTC trades are cleared through London. The average daily volume of gold and silver cleared at the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) in November 2008 was 18.3 million ounces (worth $13.9 billion) and 107.6 million ounces (worth $1.1 billion) respectively. This means that an amount equal to the annual gold mine production was cleared at the LBMA every 4.4 days, and to the annual silver production every 6.2 days. The Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee claims that <b>clearing</b> <b>data</b> substantially understates the true amount of gold traded, due to the netting of trades in the calculation of Clearing Statistics.They claim the LBMA market is $21.6 billion per business day ($5.4 trillion a year).|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{question}} of whether reducing transport costs in the Amazon has lead to increased land <b>clearing.</b> <b>Data</b> on land <b>clearing,</b> transport costs and other related variables from 1975 to 1995 is analyzed using econometric approaches that exploit the dynamic time series dimension of the data to control for possible omitted variables and endogeneity. Our results suggest that the impact of changes in transport costs on clearing depends greatly on the initial land use. Specifically, we find that in regions where a greater proportion of the land is already cleared, reducing transport costs can lessen the rate of future clearing. On the other hand, reducing transport costs through areas that have seen little human activity is more likely to increase deforestation...|$|R

50|$|According to the World Bank (2002), ‘more than 1.6 {{billion people}} depend {{to varying degrees}} on forests for their livelihoods.

In developing countries about 1.2 billion people rely on agroforestry farming systems that help to sustain agricultural productivity and generate income.’The lack of information about who really uses forests presents a major problem to forestry policy makers and supportive development agencies that are mandated to adopt a pro-poor approach.

There is no clear argument for whether the trait has significance in sexual dimorphism studies or age related studies. In some studies, there is <b>clear</b> <b>data</b> that demonstrate that Darwin's tubercle is not associated with sex. In contrast, others indicate that there is a correlation with sexual dimorphism between men and women, where men tend to have the tubercle more than women in some populations. Two studies indicate that older men tend to have greater expression of Darwin's tubercle than do older women.|$|E
