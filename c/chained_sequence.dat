At the time Bush saw the current ways of indexing information as limiting and instead proposed a way to store information that was analogous to the mental association of the human brain: storing information with the capability of easy access at a later time using certain cues (in this case, a series of numbers as a code to retrieve data). [...] The closest analogy with the modern Web browser would be to create a list of bookmarks to articles relevant to a topic, and then to have some mechanism for automatically scrolling through the articles (for example, use Google to search for a keyword, obtain a list of matches, repeatedly use the [...] "open in new tab" [...] feature of the Web browser, and then visit each tab sequentially). Modern hypertext systems with word and phrase-level linking offer more sophistication in connecting relevant information, but until the rise of wiki and other social software models, modern hypertext systems have rarely imitated Bush in providing individuals with the ability to create personal trails and share them with colleagues - or publish them widely.|$|E
5000|$|The {{redesigned}} Task Scheduler is now {{based on}} Management Console {{and can be}} used to automate management and configuration tasks. It already has a number of preconfigured system-level tasks scheduled to run at various times. In addition to time-based triggers, Task Scheduler also supports calendar and event-based triggers, such as starting a task when a particular event is logged to the event log, or even only when multiple events have occurred. Also, several tasks that are triggered by the same event can be configured to run either simultaneously or in a pre-determined <b>chained</b> <b>sequence</b> of a series of actions, instead of having to create multiple scheduled tasks. Tasks can also be configured to run based on system status such as being idle for a pre-configured amount of time, on startup, logoff, or only during or for a specified time. Tasks can be triggered by an XPath expression for filtering events from the Windows Event Log. Tasks can also be delayed for a specified time after the triggering event has occurred, or repeat until some other event occurs. Actions that need to be done if a task fails can also be configured. There are several actions defined across various categories of applications and components. Task Scheduler keeps a history log of all execution details of all the tasks.

50|$|Task Scheduler 2.0 was {{introduced}} with Windows Vista and included in Windows Server 2008 as well. The redesigned Task Scheduler user interface is now based on Management Console. In addition to running tasks on scheduled times or specified intervals, Task Scheduler 2.0 also supports calendar and event-based triggers, such as starting a task when a particular event is logged {{to the event}} log, or when a combination of events has occurred. Also, several tasks that are triggered by the same event can be configured to run either simultaneously or in a pre-determined <b>chained</b> <b>sequence</b> {{of a series of}} actions, instead of having to create multiple scheduled tasks.

The actions that can be taken in response to triggers, both event-based as well as time-based, not only include launching applications but also take a number of custom actions. Task Scheduler includes a number of actions built-in, spanning a number of applications; including send an e-mail, show a message box, or fire a COM handler when it is triggered. Custom actions can also be specified using the Task Scheduler API. Task Scheduler keeps a history log of all execution details of all the tasks.. Windows Vista uses Task Scheduler 2.0 to run various system-level tasks; consequently, the Task Scheduler service can no longer be disabled (except with a simple registry tweak).|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose the use of {{preferred}} outcome distributions as a new method to elicit individuals ’ value and probability weighting functions in decisions under risk. Extant approaches for the elicitation of these two key ingredients of individuals ’ risk attitude typically rely on a long, <b>chained</b> <b>sequence</b> of lottery choices. In contrast, preferred outcome distributions can be elicited through an intuitive graphical interface, and, as we show, {{the information contained in}} two preferred outcome distributions is sufficient to identify non-parametrically both the value function and the probability weighting function in rank-dependent utility models. To illustrate our method and its advantages, we run an incentive-compatible lab study in which participants use a simple graphical interface – the Distribution Builder (Goldstein et al. 2008) – to construct their preferred outcome distributions, subject to a budget constraint. Results show that estimates of the value function are in line with previous research but that probability weighting biases are diminished, thus favoring our proposed approach based on preferred outcome distributions...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of serial order in skilled typing, asking whether typists {{represent}} the identity and order of the keystrokes they type jointly by linking successive keystrokes into a <b>chained</b> <b>sequence,</b> or separately by associating keystrokes with position codes. In 4 experiments, typists prepared to type a prime word and were probed to type a target word. We varied the overlap between the identity and order of keystrokes in the prime and the target. Experiment 1 tested whether the identity of keystrokes can be primed separately from their order. Experiments 2 and 3 tested whether keystroke positions can be primed out of sequence. Experiment 4 tested whether keystrokes are primed equally across serial positions. The results were consistent with chaining theories: Keystroke identities were not primed separately from their order, keystroke positions were not primed out of sequence, and priming was graded across the keystroke sequence and depended on the number of keystrokes that were primed in sequence. We conclude by discussing the possibility that the problem of serial order may be solved differently for different sequential tasks...|$|E

The C- 1, C- 2, C- 3, C- 4 and C- 5 positive ions were found in the ETFE spectrum, while only the C- 1, C- 2 and C- 3 positive ions were found in the PVDF spectrum. These results indicate that ETFE can be distinguished from PVDF by the presence of its characteristic C- 4 and C- 5 positive ions. Even though both ETFE and PVDF produce some of the same C- 3 positive ions, these positive ions come from different sequence structures. The negative ToF SIMS spectra of both ETFE and PVDF are totally dominated by F- (m/z = 19) because F- is very stable, due to its largest electronegative value, and fluorine concentration in ETFE and PVDF is relatively high. These results indicate that the <b>chain</b> <b>sequence</b> structure has a significant effect on the positive ToF-SIMS spectra of ETFE and PVDF, especially in the high-mass range.

Comparison with available cytoplasmic and flagellar dynein heavy <b>chain</b> <b>sequences</b> reveals regions that are highly conserved in all dynein heavy <b>chains</b> <b>sequenced</b> to date, regions that are conserved only among axonemal dynein heavy chains, and regions that are unique to individual dynein heavy chains.

One region that is very highly conserved in all dynein heavy chains is similar to a portion of the ATP-sensitive microtubule-binding domain of kinesin. Two other regions present in all dynein heavy chains are predicted to have high alpha-helical content and have a high probability of forming coiled-coil structures. Overall, the central one-third of the gamma dynein heavy chain is most conserved whereas the N-terminal one-third is least conserved; the fact that the latter region is divergent between the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain and two different axonemal dynein heavy chains suggests that it is involved in chain-specific functions...|$|R
