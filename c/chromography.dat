40|$|Among the {{different}} methods {{of changing the}} color of human hair, oxidative hair dyeing plays an important role. The formulations consist of {{a broad spectrum of}} organic compounds among which most of the dye forming substances, i. e. the dye intermediates, are of aromatic nature. With the aim of establishing an analytical method for the separation and quantification of the dye intermediates, the chomographic behaviour of a selection of these products was investigated. The separation was done by HPLC, using reversed-phase <b>chromography.</b> UV and diode array detection were employed. A quantitative separation procedure was established with which it is possible to separate and identify intermediates according to their retention times and their UV spectra. JRC.

40|$|A non-smoking Mexican woman, aged 67 years, {{presented}} with cough and sputum production {{to a community}} health clinic. A chest radiograph showed left upper lobe nodular opacities. Mycobacteriology smear was positive for 1 to 9 acid fast bacilli (AFB) per 10 oil immersion fields, with final isolation of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex made by analysis of the mycolic acid peak profile produced by high performance liquid <b>chromography.</b> The isolate was pansensitive to the antibiotics tested (isoniazid 0. 2 μg/ml, isoiazid 1 μg/ml, rifampin 1 μg/ml, ethambutol 5 μg/ml, pyrazinamide 100 μg/ml). She was immediately treated under directly-observed therapy with a regimen consisting of four oral anti-tuberculosis medications: isoniazid 300 mg daily for 6 months, rifampin 600 mg daily for 6 months, pyrazinamide 300 mg daily for 2 months, and ethambutol 600 mg daily for 2 months. Six weeks after initiation of therapy, the three consecutive-day sputum examination was positive for 1 to 9 AFB per 100 oil immersion fields with negative cultures. Three consecutive-day sputum smears and cultures obtained subsequently were negative. Four years after treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient {{presented with}} a two-month history of productive cough (grayish-black sputum) and a five-pound weight loss. She had no associated hemoptysis, night sweats, anorexia or fever. A chest radiograph revealed fullness in the left paratracheal area withou...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation {{is to develop a}} technique with which refractory metal carbide samples can be exposed to hydrogen containing gases at high temperatures, and to use various microstructural and analytical techniques to determine the chemical and rate processes involved in hydrogen degradation in these materials. Five types of carbides were examined including WC, NbC, HfC, ZrC, and TaC. The ceramics were purchased and were all monolithic in nature. The temperature range investigated was from 850 to 1600 C with a hydrogen pressure of one atmosphere. Control experiments, in vacuum, were also conducted for comparison so that the net effects due to hydrogen could be isolated. The samples were analyzed prior to and after exposure. Gas samples were collected in selected experiments and analyzed using gas <b>chromography.</b> Characterization of the resulting microstructure after exposure to hydrogen was conducted using optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and weight change. The ceramics were purchased and were all monolithic in nature. It was found that all samples lost weight after exposure, both in hydrogen and vacuum. Results from the microstructure analyses show that the degradation processes are different among the five types of ceramics involved. In addition, the apparent activation energy for the degradation process is a function of temperature even within the same material. This indicates that there are more than one mechanism involved in each material, and that the mechanisms are temperature dependent...|$|E
40|$|Mtmm: Metabolism of iophenoxio acid in the dog. 3. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 178 : 173 - 179, 1971. The biliary and urinary {{metabolites}} of iophenoxic acid were charac terized {{in experiments}} on 12 dogs by thin-layer <b>chromography,</b> countercurrent distribution, analysis of isolated peaks for glucuronic acid content and various hydrolysis charaeteristics. Except for one experiment, iophenoxic acid itself was not excreted {{in more than}} trace amounts. The major metabolites were a diglucuronide and the acyl and ethereal mono glucuronidee. A fourth metabolite, possibly the result of side chain oxidation, has been detected but not completely characterized. p-Glucuronidase hydrolysis in many samples was complete and in others incomplete, for unknown reasons. Alkaline hydrolysis of the acyl linkage was demonstrable, but the procedure itself is extremely sensitive to the concentration of alkali and hence of unpredictablevalue in the quantification of metabolites. The metabo lithe of iophenoxic acid are themselves relatively lipid soluble, although far less so than the parent compound. However, {{it is unlikely that}} their lipid sohubility per se is the major determinant of the unique persistence of iophenoxic acid; the rate of conjugate formation appears to be a more important factor. lophenoxic acid (Teridax) was used clinically as a cholecystographic agent for a few years un til 1957 when it was withdrawn because of its exceptional persistence. A plasma half-life of 2 Âyears was estimated by Astwood (1957). Other gall bladder agents persist for up to several months and have been shown to form glucuronide conjugates (Langecker and Ertel...|$|E
