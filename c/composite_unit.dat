5|$|Although {{the cavalry}} had been {{successful}} in protecting the park, by 1914 the average soldier was not cutout for the strenuous, diplomatic and tedious nature of the work, and {{the high level of}} training related to cavalry skills. World War I added further impetus to a transition back to civilian management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a <b>composite</b> <b>unit</b> of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, many of whom had served in Yellowstone previously.|$|E
25|$|A new {{battalion}} {{was created}} in the Arkansas National Guard from existing units, 3rd Battalion, 206th Artillery was a <b>composite</b> <b>unit</b> with one 8-inch howitzer battery and one MGR-1 Honest John rocket battery.|$|E

30|$|The {{other two}} cupcake tasks that {{involved}} reasoning about <b>composites</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> (groups of rows of cupcakes) were not generally solvable for INS or eTNS students, {{so they were}} in that way useful for differentiating between eTNS and aTNS. However, we focused on how correct solutions differed, which helped us distinguish between aTNS and ENS students. Overall, we found the following types of evidence in correct solutions of cupcake tasks: Solutions that lacked evidence {{of the construction of}} <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> (possible for INS students) included pen marks from counting and recounting units of 1, indicating a focus on counting units of 1 and not the figurative composites. Solutions that showed evidence of constructing <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> in activity (possible for eTNS students) included written counts of <b>composite</b> <b>units,</b> indicating the explicit awareness of <b>composites</b> as countable <b>units.</b> Solutions that showed evidence of an anticipatory use of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> (possible for aTNS students) included (a) the complete or partial curtailment of drawing figurative units of 1 and/or a single symbol to represent a composite unit; (b) using <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> to organize diagrams (Figs.  8 d and 9 a); (c) written coordinations of multiple counts, such as counts of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> and total units of 1; and (d) immediate unpacking of <b>composites</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> into units of 1, bypassing further operations on <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b> Solutions that indicated the ability to construct and potentially operate on in activity, <b>composites</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> (possible for ENS students) included (a) disembedding (lack of embedding) of a <b>composite</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> (ENS) and (b) the absence of written supports (no intermediate calculations or figurative items). It {{is important to remember that}} students may not use the most sophisticated strategies available to them on any particular problem, so that rubrics need to give more weight to the most sophisticated use of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> that is evidenced. Moreover, because students’ written responses can only be interpreted as providing positive evidence or absence of evidence, the number sequence classifications for students based on these tasks represent a lower bound in terms of their reasoning with <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
30|$|Tasks {{involving}} discrete {{units in}} which figurative representations of units and (to the observer) <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> were provided seemed to elicit {{a greater variety}} of written solutions. We will use student solutions from two of these tasks to illustrate how use of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> can be evidenced with written work. The first task was useful for differentiating the use of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> in activity or assimilation. For this task, there are marked differences between the types of figurative support used by the students at different stages. The second task was useful for differentiating the use of <b>composites</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> in activity or assimilation.|$|R
30|$|Cupcake Task C is {{indicative}} of six tasks on the assessment in which the student is given a situation that involves a <b>composite</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b> Generally, ENS students can operate effectively in these situations. Because {{of the lack of}} efficiency with which eTNS students conceptualize <b>composite</b> <b>units,</b> creating and then operating on <b>composites</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> creates an unsustainable cognitive load. However, aTNS students’ ability to anticipate the use of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> opens the door for them to make sense of these tasks, even if they have trouble carrying out the mental operations to complete them effectively. This was evident in the fact that over 56 % of students categorized as aTNS made a reasonable attempt at solving the majority of these tasks.|$|R

25|$|Merrill’s Marauders (named after Frank Merrill) or Unit Galahad, officially {{named the}} 5307th <b>Composite</b> <b>Unit</b> (Provisional), was a United States Army long range {{penetration}} special operations jungle warfare unit, which {{fought in the}} South-East Asian theatre of World War II, or China-Burma-India Theater (CBI). The unit became famous for its deep-penetration missions behind Japanese lines, often engaging Japanese forces superior in number.|$|E
25|$|The {{regiment}} {{was then}} tasked {{to put together}} a <b>composite</b> <b>unit</b> of Shermans to relieve the 142nd RAC Regt's composite group with the 8th Indian Infantry Division, and the advance began westwards to Perugia, which fell on 20 June. On 16 June, the Horse again relieved the 142nd, this time at Bastia Umbra. In the days and actions that followed, new upgunned Churchill tanks arrived, with their Besa machine guns.|$|E
30|$|In our {{analysis}} of students’ written work on the assessment, we found that written work on tasks that included figurative unit items, such as cupcakes, boxes, and/or rows on the cupcake tasks, provided the greatest variety of evidence regarding students’ construction of and operation on <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b> Furthermore, a situation that would represent a simple division situation (Cupcake Task A) was most useful in helping determine whether the students had constructed <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> and/or were using <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> anticipatorily in planning solution activities. These distinctions are important for distinguishing between INS, eTNS, and aTNS students.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Iran {{changed the}} status of its {{airports}} and former Tac Air Bases in combined airfields according to its current policy of having limited fixed units stationed as IRIAF's new policy is using <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b> These <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> may be stationed at any airfield and may be moved overnight to any other airfield at short notice. Therefore, all combined airfields are or will be accommodated with basic cross-service capabilities to handle all IRIAF aircraft.|$|R
30|$|There was one task {{meant to}} provide an {{opportunity}} for students to show whether they assimilated tasks with <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> or three-level units. In this task, one bar was said to be 14 units long and the student was asked to draw a bar that was 21 units long. If the student were to utilize 7 -unit lengths to draw the bar, then they would show that they could think of 14 and 21 as made up of multiples of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> before operating and utilize that knowledge to plan a solution strategy. That would, in fact, imply a stage higher than the ENS stage but certainly would be a decisive indication of ENS. Simply solving that problem would require assimilation with <b>composite</b> <b>units,</b> which implies at least an aTNS.|$|R

25|$|Klakring sailed {{for nearly}} five weeks of Refresher Training off Guantánamo Bay on 14 January 1985. On 21 February, Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron (Light—HSL-42) Detachment 3, {{equipped}} with a single Sikorsky SH-60B Seahawk Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) Mk III, embarked on board Klakring. The ship began participation in her first major fleet exercise, <b>Composite</b> <b>Unit</b> Training Exercise (COMTUEX) 2-85, on 22 April 1985. She broke up the training with a three-day visit to Frederiksted, U.S. Virgin Islands, and returned to Charleston on 8 May.|$|E
25|$|During this period, {{the group}} was the second carrier strike group to be {{commanded}} by a former nuclear submarine commanding officer. It was also the first strike group to deploy with an entire Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) helicopter squadron embarked, with individual air detachments operating from its escort ships and supported by the carrier's aviation facilities. The carrier strike group's 2007 pre-deployment <b>Composite</b> <b>Unit</b> Training Exercise included Mobile Security Squadron 2, and Helicopter Visit, Board, Search and Seizure (HVBSS) Team 1, a highly specialized boarding party, which was a first for West Coast-based ships.|$|E
30|$|We {{documented}} {{the different ways}} students represented <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> in their written work. In particular, student written work on tasks that included figurative unit items provided the greatest variety of evidence regarding students’ construction of and operation on <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b> However, written evidence from partitioning tasks did not seem as promising for distinguishing student stages. Students’ performance on decontextualized bar tasks involving continuous quantities {{was found to be}} consistent with students’ level of unit coordination based on written work providing evidence for the validity of stage categorizations.|$|R

30|$|While we {{can always}} look at whether {{students}} got a problem wrong or right {{as an indication of}} certain ways of operating, we chose to feature student responses that would highlight the range of responses involving figurative representation of or inferred internalized use of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> in solving the tasks. The focus of the discussion of the responses in this section are not meant to reflect classification strategies as student responses to a single item are not sufficient to classify students. Any stage constructions we attribute to students in the “Results and discussion” section are based on their overall performance on the assessment and a qualitative analysis of the entire assessment by the first author. The purpose of the responses we share here is to highlight aspects of student written work that indicated the construction of and operation on <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b> In particular, we will highlight two ways that this showed up in written responses: partitioning and operating on <b>composites</b> of <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
25|$|After being {{subjected}} to heavy aerial and artillery bombardment, the following day the battalion's commanding officer, Arthur Boyes, handed over command to Lieutenant Colonel Roland Oakes, formerly the second {{in command of the}} 2/19th Battalion. Boyes was called away to help organise the island's rear area defence and was subsequently given command of 'X' Battalion, a <b>composite</b> <b>unit</b> made up of reinforcements that had been separated from their units. Shortly after taking up this appointment, however, Boyes was killed along with a number of his men when the battalion was ambushed while attempting to fill a gap in the lines that had resulted from a Japanese breakthrough.|$|E
25|$|The first Chindit unit, the 77th Indian Infantry Brigade, was {{gradually}} {{formed in the}} area around Jhansi in the summer of 1942. Wingate took charge of the training of the troops in the jungles of central India during the rainy season. Half of the Chindits were British: the 13th Battalion, the King's Liverpool Regiment (nominally a second-line battalion, which contained a large number of older men) and men from the former Bush Warfare School in Burma, who were formed into 142 Commando Company. The other portion of the force consisted of the 3rd Battalion, the 2nd Gurkha Rifles (a battalion that had only just been raised) and the 2nd Battalion, the Burma Rifles (a <b>composite</b> <b>unit</b> formed from several depleted battalions of Burmese troops that had retreated into India in 1942).|$|E
25|$|When the Japanese assault came on 8 February, {{the main}} thrust {{initially}} on the 22nd Brigade's positions further west, {{but as the}} situation worsened the 2/29th was sent to Tengah airfield to bolster the 22nd Brigade's defence of the north-west sector. Plans were made to launch a counter-attack to re-capture the village of Ama Keng, but these were cancelled when further Japanese advances made this impossible. Throughout 9 February, the battalion fought to hold the airfield against growing Japanese attacks before the defenders were forced to withdraw further back to the Bulim line, positioned on the Choa Chu Kang Road in between the 2/18th Battalion and a <b>composite</b> <b>unit.</b> There, the battalion turned back a Japanese attack on 10 February, but after neighbouring units withdrew amidst the confusion, the 2/29th were also forced back. Withdrawing in contact, elements of the battalion became separated until they were regrouped at Bukit Panjang.|$|E
30|$|Finally, some {{students}} (7 out of 44 students categorized as ENS; 2 out of 39 students categorized as aTNS) simply write the answer as in Fig.  8 f. This implies {{the ability to}} assimilate the situation in terms of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> of 3 and {{keep track of the}} number of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> of 3 in the sequence from 1 to 39 with no figurative support. Clearly, this problem was relatively easy for aTNS and ENS students, so we will examine student solutions to a more complicated task that was meant to help differentiate between the TNS and ENS students.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{selection}} and dynamic binding and rebinding at runtime are new characters of composite services. The traditional static reliability prediction models are unsuitable to dynamic composite services. A new reliability predicting algorithm for composite services is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a composite service is decomposed into composition unites (executing path, composite module and atomic service) {{according to their}} constituents. Consequently, a hierarchical graph of all <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> is constructed. Lastly, a new dynamic reliability prediction algorithm is presented. Comparing with the traditional reliability model, the new dynamic reliability approach is more flexible, which does not recompute reliability for all <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> and only computes {{the reliability of the}} effected <b>composite</b> <b>units.</b> In addition, an example to show how to measure the reliability based on our algorithm is designed. The experimental results show our proposed methods can give an accurate estimation of reliability. Furthermore, a more flexible sensitivity analysis is performed to determine which service component has the most significant impact on the improvement of composite service reliability...|$|R
30|$|Figure  8 d {{shows the}} {{solution}} of a probable aTNS student who uses a much less literal representation of the situation, with tally marks representing a counted cupcake and circles representing a completed box. Furthermore, this student {{seems to have been}} aware that he or she would be making multiple groups of 3 and counting them before drawing. This {{can be seen in the}} more organized nature of the drawing. Our hypothesis would be that this student was using the figurative material to keep track of the number of times three counts were made. This all implies an awareness of <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> of 3 in planning solution activity. Figure  8 e shows {{the solution of}} a probable aTNS student who does not draw any figural representation of individual cupcakes. As in Fig.  8 b–d, the student is working with <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> of 3, but the absence of units of 1 in the written work implies that these <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> did not need to be built up in activity, as in Fig.  8 b–c. Note that aTNS students may use more literal representations. However, Fig.  8 d, e shows that aTNS students are not constrained to using more literal representations.|$|R
25|$|With the {{establishment}} of the new South East Asia Command in August 1943, Stilwell was appointed Deputy Supreme Allied Commander under Vice Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten. Taking command of various Chinese and Allied forces, including a new U.S. Army special operations formation, the 5307th <b>Composite</b> <b>Unit</b> (provisional) later known as Merrill's Marauders, Stilwell built up his Chinese forces for an eventual offensive in northern Burma. On December 21, 1943, Stilwell assumed direct control of planning for the invasion of Northern Burma, culminating with capture of the Japanese-held town of Myitkyina. In the meantime, Stilwell ordered General Merrill and the Marauders to commence long-range jungle penetration missions behind Japanese lines after the pattern of the British Chindits. In February 1944, three Marauder battalions marched into Burma. Though Stilwell was at the Ledo Road front when the Marauders arrived at their jump-off point, the general did not walk out to the road to bid them farewell.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as Executive Officer of the Third Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on November 29, 1950. Assuming command of a <b>composite</b> <b>unit</b> of Army and Marine service and headquarters elements totalling approximately 250 men, during a critical stage in the vital defense of the strategically important military base at Hagaru-ri, Major Myers immediately initiated a determined and aggressive counterattack against a well-entrenched and clearly concealed enemy force numbering an estimated 4,000. Severely handicapped by a lack of trained personnel and experienced leaders in his valiant efforts to regain maximum ground prior to daylight, he persisted in constantly exposing himself to intense, accurate and sustained hostile fire in order to direct and supervise the employment of his men and to encourage and spur them on in pressing the attack. Inexorably moving forward up the steep, snow-covered slope with his depleted group in the face of apparently insurmountable odds, he concurrently directed artillery and mortar fire with superb skill and, although losing 170 of his men during fourteen hours of raging combat in sub-zero temperatures, continued to reorganize his unit and spearhead the attack which resulted in 600 enemy killed and 500 wounded. By his exceptional and valorous leadership throughout, Major Myers contributed directly to the success of his unit in restoring the perimeter. His resolute spirit of self sacrifice and unfaltering devotion to duty enhance and sustain the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E
25|$|By early 1942, the Japanese {{had entered}} the war, and the Australian {{government}} decided to bring some of its troops from the Middle East back to Australia to bolster its defences. The 2/16th embarked {{at the end of}} January 1942, and returned to Australia, landing at Adelaide in March 1942 after a brief stopover in Fremantle. A period of reorganisation followed as they were prepared for the hardships of jungle warfare, during which time Potts handed over command of the battalion to Lieutenant Colonel Albert Caro; however, the situation in the Pacific at the time was desperate for the Australians, following Japanese victories in Malaya, Singapore, Rabaul and Ambon, and fighting on the Kokoda Track, and so the 2nd AIF troops returning from the Middle East had very little time to prepare for their next campaign. The 2/16th arrived in New Guinea, landing in Port Moresby in mid-August 1942. Later that month it was committed to the battle, and joined the fighting retreat down the Kokoda Track, being rushed into the line around Alola to fill a gap after the 53rd Battalion fell back from Isurava. At the Battle of Mission Ridge in early September it suffered heavy casualties after being encircled by the Japanese and conducting a fighting withdrawal to Imita Ridge. Following its relief in the middle of September, the battalion's surviving members were joined with those from the 2/14th Battalion to form a <b>composite</b> <b>unit</b> temporarily, as the battalion suffered so many casualties in the retreat that it was down to an effective strength of about 200 men; the 2/14th had also suffered heavily.|$|E

30|$|One {{result of}} the fact that aTNS {{students}} can operate fluently with <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> is that they can use <b>composite</b> <b>units</b> as a template for partitioning a whole into small numbers of equal parts. INS and eTNS students would, in contrast, attempt to equi-segment (Steffe, 2010 b) a fractional whole by making a guess as to the size of one segment and then using that segment as a template for measuring off further pieces. This generally results in slow and inaccurate partitioning operations. An aTNS student can mentally visualize a <b>composite</b> of continuous <b>units,</b> project that onto the unpartitioned whole, and then mentally adjust the sizes of the continuous <b>units</b> in the <b>composite</b> to get a much better initial estimation than an eTNS student would. This is called simultaneous partitioning (Hackenberg, Norton, & Wright, 2016; Steffe, 2010 b) because of the simultaneous awareness of all the partitions before the student acts on the visible whole.|$|R
