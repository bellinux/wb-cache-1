25|$|Amoxicillin is {{susceptible}} to degradation by β-lactamase-producing bacteria, which are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin. For this reason, it may be combined with <b>clavulanic</b> <b>acid,</b> a β-lactamase inhibitor. This drug combination is commonly called co-amoxiclav.|$|E
25|$|Although the inhibitor-resistant TEM {{variants}} {{are resistant}} to inhibition by <b>clavulanic</b> <b>acid</b> and sulbactam, thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactam—beta lactamase inhibitor combinations of amoxicillin-clavulanate (Co-amoxiclav), ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin/sulbactam, they remain susceptible to inhibition by tazobactam and subsequently the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea and rash. It may also {{increase}} the risk of yeast infections and, when used in combination with <b>clavulanic</b> <b>acid,</b> diarrhea. It should not be used in those who are allergic to penicillin. While usable in those with kidney problems, the dose may need to be decreased. Its use in pregnancy and breastfeeding {{does not appear to be}} harmful.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} of benefit in terms of live birth rate of using hyaluronic acid as adherence medium for the embryo. Neither is there any evidence of benefit of having a full bladder, removal of cervical mucus, or flushing of the endometrial or endocervical cavity at the time of embryo transfer. Adjunctive antibiotics in the form of amoxicillin plus <b>clavulanic</b> <b>acid</b> does not increase the clinical pregnancy rate compared with no antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Although the inhibitor-resistant β-lactamases are not ESBLs, {{they are}} often {{discussed}} with ESBLs because they are also derivatives of the classical TEM- or SHV-type enzymes. These enzymes were at first given the designation IRT for inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamase; however, all have subsequently been renamed with numerical TEM designations. There are at least 19 distinct inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamases. Inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamases have been found mainly in clinical isolates of E. coli, but also some strains of K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, P. mirabilis, and Citrobacter freundii. Although the inhibitor-resistant TEM variants are resistant to inhibition by <b>clavulanic</b> <b>acid</b> and sulbactam, thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactam—lactamase inhibitor combinations of amoxicillin-clavulanate (co-amoxiclav), ticarcillin-clavulanate (co-ticarclav), and ampicillin/sulbactam, they normally remain susceptible to inhibition by tazobactam and subsequently the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam, although resistance has been described. This {{is no longer a}} primarily European epidemiology, it is found in northern parts of America often and should be tested for with complex UTI's.|$|E
2500|$|AmpC type β-lactamases are {{commonly}} isolated from extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. AmpC β-lactamases (also termed class C or group 1) are typically encoded on the chromosome of many Gram-negative bacteria including Citrobacter, Serratia and Enterobacter species where its expression is usually inducible; {{it may also}} occur on Escherichia coli but is not usually inducible, although it can be hyperexpressed. [...] AmpC type β-lactamases may also be carried on plasmids. AmpC β-lactamases, in contrast to ESBLs, hydrolyse broad and extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cephamycins {{as well as to}} oxyimino-β-lactams) but are not inhibited by β-lactamase inhibitors such as <b>clavulanic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
2500|$|TEM-1 is {{the most}} {{commonly}} encountered beta-lactamase in Gram-negative bacteria. Up to 90% of ampicillin resistance in E. coli {{is due to the}} production of TEM-1. [...] Also responsible for the ampicillin and penicillin resistance that is seen in H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae in increasing numbers. Although TEM-type beta-lactamases are most often found in E. coli and K. pneumoniae, they are also found in other species of Gram-negative bacteria with increasing frequency. The amino acid substitutions responsible for the extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) phenotype cluster around the active site of the enzyme and change its configuration, allowing access to oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates. Opening the active site to beta-lactam substrates also typically enhances the susceptibility of the enzyme to β-lactamase inhibitors, such as <b>clavulanic</b> <b>acid.</b> Single amino acid substitutions at positions 104, 164, 238, and 240 produce the ESBL phenotype, but ESBLs with the broadest spectrum usually have more than a single amino acid substitution. Based upon different combinations of changes, currently 140 TEM-type enzymes have been described. TEM-10, TEM-12, and TEM-26 are among the most common in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|OXA beta-lactamases {{were long}} {{recognized}} as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze oxacillin and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d [...] The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against oxacillin and cloxacillin {{and the fact that}} they are poorly inhibited by <b>clavulanic</b> <b>acid.</b> Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. While most ESBLs have been found in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and other Enterobacteriaceae, the OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in P. aeruginosa. OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from Turkey and France. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Clavulanic</b> <b>acid,</b> which {{inhibits}} β-lactamase: <b>clavulanic</b> <b>acid</b> covalently {{bonds to}} a serine {{reside in the}} active site of the β-lactamase, restructuring the <b>clavulanic</b> <b>acid</b> molecule, creating a much more reactive species that attacks another amino acid in the active site, permanently inactivating it, and thus inactivating the enzyme β-lactamase.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Clavulanic</b> <b>acid</b> is biosynthesized {{from the}} amino acid {{arginine}} and the sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. With the β-lactam like structure, <b>clavulanic</b> <b>acid</b> looks structurally similar to penicillin, but the biosynthesis of this molecule involves a different pathway and set of enzymes. <b>Clavulanic</b> <b>acid</b> is biosynthesized by the bacterium Streptomyces clavuligerus, using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and L-arginine {{as the starting}} materials of the pathway. [...] Although all of the intermediates of the pathway are known, the exact mechanism of each enzymatic reaction is not fully understood. The biosynthesis mainly involves 3 enzymes: clavaminate synthase, β-lactam synthetase and N2-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-arginine synthase(CEA).Clavaminate synthase is a non-heme iron α-keto-glutarate dependent oxygenase that is encoded by orf5 of the <b>clavulanic</b> <b>acid</b> gene cluster. The specific mechanism of how this enzyme works is not fully understood, but this enzyme regulates 3 steps in the overall synthesis of <b>clavulanic</b> <b>acid.</b> All 3 steps occur in the same region of the catalytic iron center, yet do not occur in-sequence and affect {{different areas of the}} <b>clavulanic</b> <b>acid</b> structure.|$|E
