5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September16 with copious convection. It tracked westward, developing into Tropical Depression Twelve on September21 while located {{a few hundred miles}} west of Cape Verde. Without intensifying further, the depression turned northward, due to a weakness caused by the deepening of a 200 mbar <b>cut-off</b> <b>low</b> near the Iberian Peninsula. Under the influence of a building high pressure area, the depression turned to a northwest and later westward drift. It into Tropical Storm Josephine on September24, although increased wind shear from a trough weakened the storm back to a tropical depression on September26. It remained weak for several days, gradually turning to the north due to a weak trough over the northwestern Atlantic. On October1, another high pressure area halted its northward movement, causing Josephine to turn to the east. That day, it re-intensified into a tropical storm as it began to execute a small cyclonic loop. An approaching trough caused Josephine to accelerate north-northeastward, and with favorable conditions it intensified into a hurricane on October5, after existing nearly two weeks.|$|E
5|$|An unusually severe Mediterranean {{tropical}} cyclone developed on 23September 1969 southeast of Malta, producing severe flooding. Steep pressure and temperature gradients above the Atlas mountain range were evident on 19September, {{a result of}} cool sea air attempting to penetrate inland; south of the mountains, a lee depression—a low-pressure area in a mountainous region—developed. Under the influence of mountainous terrain, the low initially meandered northeastward. Following the entry of cool sea air, however, it recurved to the southeast before transitioning into a Saharan depression associated with a distinct cold front by 22September. Along the front's path, desert air moved northward while cold air drifted in the opposite direction, and in northern Libya, warm arid air clashed with the cooler levant of the Mediterranean. The organization of the disturbance improved slightly further before emerging into the Mediterranean Sea on 23September, upon which the system experienced immediate cyclogenesis, rapidly intensifying while southeast of Malta as a cold-core <b>cut-off</b> <b>low,</b> and acquiring tropical characteristics. In western Africa, meanwhile, several disturbances converged toward Mauritania and Algeria, while the medicane recurved southwestward back toward the coast, losing its closed circulation and later dissipating.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cut-off</b> <b>lows</b> {{are common}} {{features}} of Mediterranean meteorology in warm months {{and are often}} related to severe weather. The present work introduces a classification of cut-off episodes, based on the vertical extension of the depression {{and the presence of}} a linked surface vortex, also analyzing precipitation patterns. Ten years of warm-season ERA- 40 reanalysis, available every six hours on a 2. 5 degrees x 2. 5 degrees grid, are processed to extract a database of <b>cut-off</b> <b>lows</b> and surface cyclones, along with the related total and convective precipitation at the ground. The high temporal resolution of the dataset permits a detailed characterization of short lasting events, so far poorly analyzed. The results show the relative abundance (41 % of the total) of cut-off events lasting less than 24 hrs, sharing most of the characteristics of longer living cut-off in terms of structures and precipitation pattern. A large part of the 273 events identified in our database, about 54 %, appear as high level signatures of depressions extending through {{a large portion of the}} troposphere, and in 38 % of cases a well defined cyclonic structure is found at the ground. Most of these events carry precipitation, with relatively high rain-rates over wide areas, with well developed frontal rain bands. Among the cut-off events without a deep vertical structure (46 %), about half do not produce precipitation, while the others produce relatively high rain-rates, although confined to small areas, indicating the presence of convective systems developing beneath the cut-offlow system. Such precipitation patterns are also confirmed at smaller scales by cloud resolving model runs. Finally, <b>cut-off</b> <b>lows</b> characterized by relatively high potential vorticity values in the mid-upper troposphere seem to have the potential for precipitation...|$|R

Slightly weakening, Rolf neared the Balearic Islands on 7November, associated with two fronts producing heavy rain throughout Europe, before separating entirely and transitioning into a <b>cut-off</b> <b>low.</b> The same day, the NOAA began monitoring the system, designating it as 01M, marking {{the first time it}} officially monitored a medicane. A distinct eye-like feature developed while spiral banding and intense convection became evident. At its highest, the Dvorak technique classified the system as T3.0. Convection gradually decreased, and a misalignment of the mid- and upper- level centers was noted. The system continued to rapidly weaken on 9November, before advisories were halted on the system later that day, and FU Berlin followed suit by 10November, removing the name Rolf from its weather maps and declaring its dissipation. The deep warm core of this cyclone persisted for a longer time compared to other tropical-like cyclones in the Mediterranean.|$|E
500|$|Similar to a Subtropical Depression 13 in April 2000, {{there was}} an unusual {{subtropical}} cyclone that formed in June to end the season. A trough exited South Africa on June18 with an associated frontal wave in the southern Mozambique Channel. On the next day, the system separated from the front and became a <b>cut-off</b> <b>low.</b> It moved north-northwestward along the eastern periphery of a ridge in southern Africa, becoming a subtropical depression on June20. The associated convection initially diminished, although the thunderstorms redeveloped due to the atmospheric instability in the region. On June21, the depression passed about 100km (60mi) east of Maputo, Mozambique, while moving into an area of much warmer waters. As such, the structure became more tropical, with a small central dense overcast forming over the circulation only 75km (45mi) in diameter. The JTWC initiated advisories on June21 as Tropical Cyclone 12S. The small size of the storm merited the MFR calling it a [...] "midget cyclone", with a small eye forming late on June21. Based on the feature, the JTWC estimated peak 1winds of 120km/h (75mph); in contrast, the MFR estimated 10minute winds of 95km/h (60mph). Despite the structure, the convection was shallow, which brought uncertainty to the true intensity of the storm. Turning to the northeast and east, the subtropical storm rapidly weakened on June22 to depression status after the environment became hostile, and the convection largely dissipated. The exposed low turned northwestward on June23, dissipating the next day.|$|E
500|$|From {{the evening}} of October 16 through the next morning, the {{hurricane}} experienced further internal fluctuations as it approached Bermuda from the south-southwest. Concurrently, the storm began to weaken. In particular, cloud tops around the hurricane warmed, and convection became less uniform, likely attributable to cooler waters and heightened wind shear. The hurricane was downgraded to Category 2 as the northern eyewall crossed Bermuda, and at about 00:30UTC on October 18, the center of circulation passed directly over the island, signalling an official landfall. Along with Hurricane Fay, which struck Bermuda on October12, this represented the first recorded instance of two hurricanes making landfall on the island within the same season. Moving away from Bermuda, the hurricane continued to degrade, but showed signs of increased organization later on October 18. As Gonzalo accelerated northeastward at over 50mph (85km/h), it passed about 50 miles (85km) southeast of Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula early on October 19. In spite of sea surface temperatures below , the storm was able to maintain a central dense overcast and deep warm core. By 18:00UTC, Gonzalo had finally succumbed to the cold environment and intense wind shear, completing its transition into a strong extratropical cyclone about [...] northeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Gonzalo's remnants sped east-northeastward until a frontal boundary absorbed it on October 20, to the south-southwest of Iceland. The resultant system brought stormy weather to the British Isles and parts of mainland Europe on October 21, and later contributed {{to the formation of}} a large <b>cut-off</b> <b>low.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{generation}} of 24 extreme floods in large catchments {{of the central}} Alps is analyzed from instrumental and documentary data, newly digitized observations of precipitation (DigiHom) and 20 th Century Reanalysis (20 CR) data. Extreme floods {{are determined by the}} 95 th percentile of differences between an annual flood and a defined contemporary flood. For a selection of six events between 1868 and 1910, we describe preconditioning elements such as precipitation, temperature, and snow cover anomalies. Specific weather patterns are assessed through a subjective analysis of three-dimensional atmospheric circulation. A focus is placed on synoptic-scale features including mid-tropospheric ascent, low-level moisture transport, propagation of cyclones, and temperature anomalies. We propose a hydro-meteorological classification of all 24 investigated events according to flood-generating weather conditions. Key elements of the upper-level synoptic-scale flow are summarized by five types: (i) pivoting <b>cut-off</b> <b>lows,</b> (ii) elongated <b>cut-off</b> <b>lows,</b> (iii) elongated troughs, (iv) waves (with a kink), and (v) approximately zonal flow over the Alpine region. We found that the most extreme floods (as above, but ≥ 98 th percentile) in Switzerland since 1868 were caused by the interaction of severe hydro-climatologic conditions with a flood-inducing weather situation. The 20 CR data provide plausible synoptic-scale meteorological patterns leading to heavy precipitation. The proposed catalogue of weather patterns and hydro-climatologic precursors can give direction when anticipating the possibility of severe floods in the Alpine region...|$|R
2500|$|The {{tropical}} upper tropospheric cyclone has a cold core, {{meaning it}} is stronger aloft {{than at the}} Earth's surface, or stronger {{in areas of the}} troposphere with lower pressures. [...] This is explained by the thermal wind relationship. [...] It also means that a pool of cold air aloft is associated with the feature. [...] If both an upper tropospheric cold-core low and lower tropospheric easterly wave trough are in-phase, with the easterly wave near or to the east of the upper level cyclone, thunderstorm development (also known as moist convection) is enhanced. [...] If they are out-of-phase, with the tropical wave west of the upper level circulation, convection is suppressed due to convergence aloft leading to downward motion over the tropical wave or surface trough in the easterlies. [...] Upper level cyclones also interact with troughs in the subtropical westerlies, such as cold fronts and stationary fronts. [...] When the subtropical disturbances in the Northern Hemisphere actively move southward, or dig, the area between the upper tropospheric anticyclone to its west and cold-core low to its east generally have strong northeasterly winds in addition to a rapid development of active thunderstorm activity. [...] Cloud bands associated with upper tropospheric cyclonic vortices are aligned with the vertical wind shear. [...] Animated satellite cloud imagery is a better tool for their early detection and tracking. [...] The low-level convergence caused by the <b>cut-off</b> <b>low</b> can trigger squall lines and rough seas, and the low-level spiral cloud bands caused by the upper level circulation are parallel to the low-level wind direction.

40|$|This thesis classifies and {{describes}} the synoptic weather patterns resulting in floods, investigates the spatial properties of dryland rainfall, and identifies {{the links between}} flooding and flow patterns with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) in Australian dryland rivers catchments. Flooding of dryland rivers in the monsoon dominated northern areas, such as in Timor Sea and Gulf of Carpentaria drainage divisions, is exclusively the result of tropical trough/lows, deep tropical lows (monsoon depressions) and tropical cyclones. The Timor Sea division, however, has {{a larger proportion of}} floods caused by tropical cyclones (32 % of the total) compared to the Gulf of Carpentaria division (7 % of the total). In the latter division 80 % of the floods are the result of tropical trough/lows and deep tropical lows whereas in the Timor Sea division only 48 % of floods are the result of these two synoptic classes. They also cause a high proportion of floods in the Indian Ocean division together with the Gascoyne-Murchison-Greenough region of the central west of Western Australia. Tropical cyclones tend to produce the largest floods in all these divisions. In the more centrally located regions such as the Lake Eyre division, the northeast Murray-Darling Rivers, the Bulloo, Paroo and Warrego Rivers, and the Greenough, Murchison and Gascoyne Rivers, there are many more types of flood-producing weather patterns compared to the monsoon dominated drainage divisions further north. Flooding can result from at least six different synoptic classes individually, including tropical trough/lows, deep tropical lows, tropical cyclones, frontal systems and easterly dips (continental and offshore). Twenty-nine percent of floods result from combined synoptic classes with 15 different combinations involving every synoptic class. Tropical trough/lows and easterly dips (continental) are dominant. Easterly dips (continental) are significant flood producing weather patterns in these centrally located regions and tend to occur in the winter months in association with favourable upper atmosphere conditions and strengthening high-pressure systems. In southern areas, such as in the southwest coastal division of Western Australia and the southern Murray-Darling basin, frontal systems and <b>cut-off</b> <b>lows</b> are the dominant flood-producing weather patterns. However, in the latter a larger proportion of floods result from <b>cut-off</b> <b>lows</b> (18 %) relative to frontal systems (8 %), whilst in the southwest coastal division frontal systems produce a larger proportion of floods (29 %) relative to <b>cut-off</b> <b>lows</b> (26 %). <b>Cut-off</b> <b>lows</b> were also found to result in a significant number of floods in the Greenough, Murchison and Gascoyne Rivers in central Western Australia. These can often combine with northwest cloudbands in this area, the largest flood on record for the Gascoyne River being the result of such a combination. In contrast to many other dryland regions of the world, rainfall in dryland Australia (both flooding and storm rainfall totals) is relatively widespread and uniform rather than localized and convective. However, rainfall in the arid Todd River region around Alice Springs is slightly less widespread than rainfall in the semi-arid Thomson River region, particularly for smaller storm-rainfall events. It appears that the smaller rainfall events in more arid areas of Australia are the result of more convective, smaller scale weather patterns that lead to more discrete, localized rainfall totals. In comparison, larger rainfall events that produce flooding are the result of synoptic scale weather patterns such as tropical trough/lows, deep tropical lows or ex-tropical cyclones, and tend to result in relatively widespread and uniform rainfall across the region. Only north and northeast Australia show a clear, consistent and predictable relationship between the magnitude of partial series flood events and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) indices, with correlation coefficients modest but reaching 0. 40 - 0. 50. The SST 1 anomaly (The SST 1 anomaly represents the sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean) and the SOI appear to be the most reliable indicators. For seasonal correlations in north and northeast Australia, spring, summer and autumn monthly flows are more highly correlated with the SOI and SSTs, whereas in southern Australia winter and spring monthly flows are more highly correlated. This demonstrates that the specific synoptic weather patterns that cause high seasonal monthly flows are related to the SOI and SSTs. In Western Australia autumn and winter seasonal flows are strongly negatively correlated with Indian Ocean SSTs. These correlations are strongest in the northwest and are related to the Indian Ocean dipole. Over the last 300 Ka it has been inferred that the monsoon played a pivotal role during warmer interglacial periods, generating greater runoff throughout much of dryland Australia. Under climate change, where temperatures would be higher, it thought that the monsoon, with its characteristic wet and dry seasons, would affect areas further to the south. Monsoon lows and ex-tropical cyclones would more frequently affect southern areas, whilst mid-latitude weather patterns, such as frontal systems and <b>cut-off</b> <b>lows,</b> would only seriously affect the very southern areas. Further to this the more central dryland regions, such as the northern Murray-Darling Rivers, that currently receive flooding through a large range of weather patterns, would probably become dominated by tropical systems...|$|R

Operationally, the system was considered a tropical depression for its entire duration, thus, this went unnamed. The storm began curving northeastward, and by early on June 15, it peaked with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h).|$|E
5000|$|On October 1, a {{tropical}} depression {{developed over the}} northwestern Caribbean Sea from the same <b>cut-off</b> <b>low</b> pressure that spawned the previous subtropical storm on September 29. The depression moved quickly north-northeastward and struck Cuba early on October 2. While approaching the southwest coast of Florida later that day, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Jenny. Simultaneously, Jenny attained its peak intensity with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a minimum pressure of [...] Around 0000 UTC on October 2, the storm made landfall between Fort Myers and Naples, Florida, with winds of 40 mph (60 km/h). Jenny emerged into the western Atlantic as {{a tropical}} depression, but increased ridging forced the storm to track west-southwestward back over Florida. The cyclone was unable to re-strengthen and dissipated on October 6 south of Louisiana.|$|E
50|$|A surge {{from the}} {{westerlies}} and a <b>cut-off</b> <b>low</b> formed a new low-pressure {{system in the}} waters of the Pacific Ocean just north of Truk on August 11. The system proceeded northwest for two-days, passing northeast of Guam, where it strengthened on August 13 into a tropical storm with winds of 60 mph (90 km/h). The storm rapidly intensified as it bent northward, gaining typhoon strength in less than twelve hours, and making a direct hit with the island of Saipan on the morning of August 14. Continuing to gain strength, Typhoon Ruth crossed northward past Saipan, becoming a Category 5 typhoon with winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) on the afternoon of August 15. The typhoon soon turned towards the northwest and past near Iwo Jima as a 185 mph (295 km/h) typhoon on the evening of August 16.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{investigate}} the γ-ray spectra of AGN by summing up {{the intensity and}} the power-law fit statistic of Quasars and OVV's and BL Lac's separately. The spectrum of the average AGN is softer {{than that of the}} extragalactic γ-ray background. It may be that BL Lac's, of which the average has a harder spectrum than Quasars, make up the bulk of the extragalactic background. We also find <b>cut-offs</b> both at <b>low</b> and at high energies in the spectra of Quasars and OVV's, however only at the time of to do with opacity, the <b>cut-off</b> at <b>low</b> energies may be taken as indication that the γ-ray emission of Quasars is not a one component spectrum...|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of medicanes often {{results from the}} vertical shift of air in the troposphere as well, resulting in a decrease in its temperature coinciding {{with an increase in}} relative humidity, creating an environment more conducive for tropical cyclone formation. This, in turn, leads to in an increase in potential energy, producing heat-induced air-sea instability. Moist air prevents the occurrence of convective downdrafts—the vertically downward movement of air—which often hinder the inception of tropical cyclones, and in such a scenario, wind shear remains minimal; overall, cold-core <b>cut-off</b> <b>lows</b> serve well for the later formation of compact surface flux-influenced warm-core lows such as medicanes. The regular genesis of cold-core upper-level lows and the infrequency of Mediterranean tropical cyclones, however, indicate that additional unusual circumstances are involved the emergence of the latter. Elevated sea surface temperatures, contrasting with cold atmospheric air, encourage atmospheric instability, especially within the troposphere.|$|R
