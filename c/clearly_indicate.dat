5|$|These data <b>clearly</b> <b>indicate</b> the {{stability}} of neutral ferrocene and the cobaltocenium and rhodocenium cations. Rhodocene is ca. 500mV more reducing than cobaltocene, indicating {{that it is more}} readily oxidised and hence less stable. An earlier polarographic investigation of rhodocenium perchlorate at neutral pH showed a cathodic wave peak at −1.53V (versus SCE) at the dropping mercury electrode, corresponding to the formation rhodocene in solution, but the researchers were unable to isolate the neutral product from solution. In the same study, attempts to detect iridocene by exposing iridocenium salts to oxidising conditions were unsuccessful even at elevated pH. These data are consistent with rhodocene being highly unstable and may indicate that iridocene is even more unstable still.|$|E

25|$|Abbottella and its {{relatives}} {{appear to}} have evolved on mainland Hispaniola, and thus {{were not part of}} the Tiburon Peninsula species assemblage that was tectonically rafted to the island.

25|$|Studying the {{evolution}} of butterflies and moths is challenging, since fossils are so rare. But the few Lepidopteran fossils that exist, captured in amber or compressed in fine-grained rocks, show great detail. The earliest Lepidopteran fossils appear in rocks that are about 190 million years old. These tiny fragments of scaled wings and bodies <b>clearly</b> <b>indicate</b> that moths evolved before butterflies.|$|E

25|$|In early rabbinic Judaism (the early {{centuries of}} the 1st {{millennium}} CE), the terms Ma'aseh Bereshit ("Works of Creation") and Ma'aseh Merkabah ("Works of the Divine Throne/Chariot") <b>clearly</b> <b>indicate</b> the Midrashic {{nature of these}} speculations; they are really based upon Genesis 1 and Ezekiel 1:4–28, while the names Sitrei Torah (Hidden aspects of the Torah) (Talmud Hag. 13a) and Razei Torah (Torah secrets) (Ab. vi. 1) indicate their character as secret lore. An additional term also expanded Jewish esoteric knowledge, namely Chochmah Nistara (Hidden wisdom).|$|E

25|$|When {{a street}} is {{wide enough to}} {{accommodate}} several vehicles traveling side-by-side, it is usual for traffic to organize itself into lanes, that is, parallel corridors of traffic. Some roads have one lane for each direction of travel and others have multiple lanes for each direction. Most countries apply pavement markings to <b>clearly</b> <b>indicate</b> the limits of each lane and the direction of travel {{that it must be}} used for. In other countries lanes have no markings at all and drivers follow them mostly by intuition rather than visual stimulus.|$|E
25|$|Using {{satellite}} imagery {{in combination with}} GIS and on-the-ground studies, {{it is possible to}} generate maps of likely occurrences of future landslides. Such maps should show the locations of previous events as well as <b>clearly</b> <b>indicate</b> the probable locations of future events. In general, to predict landslides, one must assume that their occurrence is determined by certain geologic factors, and that future landslides will occur under the same conditions as past events. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a relationship between the geomorphologic conditions in which the past events took place and the expected future conditions.|$|E
25|$|The way {{health is}} {{displayed}} on the screen {{has an effect on}} the player. Many games only show the health of the player character, while keeping the health of enemies hidden. This is done in the Legend of Zelda series and Monster Hunter series to keep the player's progress in defeating their enemy unclear and therefore exciting. In these games, the fact that the enemies are being damaged is indicated by their behavior. On the other hand, many fighting games, such as the Street Fighter series, use easy-to-read health bars to <b>clearly</b> <b>indicate</b> the progress the player is making with each hit.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} mark motif was common throughout the 1980s, {{in part as}} a branding attempt. Beginning with season eighteen, the Fourth through Seventh Doctors all sported costumes with a red {{question mark}} motif (usually on the shirt collars, except for the Seventh Doctor – it appeared on his pullover and {{in the shape of}} his umbrella handle). In the 1978 serial The Invasion of Time, the Fourth Doctor is asked to sign a document; although the signature itself is not directly seen on screen, his hand movements <b>clearly</b> <b>indicate</b> that he signs it with a question mark. A similar scene occurs with the Seventh Doctor in Remembrance of the Daleks.|$|E

In 1951 Japan formally signed the Treaty of San Francisco but, due to the unclear situation of the Chinese civil war, the peace treaty did not <b>clearly</b> <b>indicate</b> to whom Taiwan's sovereignty belonged. In the second article of the 1952 Treaty of Taipei, following the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan reiterated its abandonment of sovereignty of Taiwan, the Pescadores, the Spratlys and the Paracels in the Treaty of San Francisco.|$|E

25|$|The Pauline {{letters were}} not {{intended}} to provide a narrative {{of the life of}} Jesus, but were written as expositions of Christian teachings. In Paul's view, the earthly life of Jesus was of a lower importance than the theology of his death and resurrection,a theme that permeates Pauline writings. However, the Pauline letters <b>clearly</b> <b>indicate</b> that for Paul Jesus was a real person (born of a woman as in Gal 4.4) who had disciples (1 Corinthians 15.5), who was crucified (as in 1 Corinthians 2.2 and Galatians 3.1) and who resurrected from the dead (1 Corinthians 15.20, Romans 1.4 and 6.5, Philippians 3:10-11). And the letters reflect the general concept within the early Gentillic Christian Church that Jesus existed, was crucified and was raised from the dead.|$|E
25|$|In modern phylogeny, clades {{are defined}} that contain all species forming a certain {{branch of the}} {{evolutionary}} tree. This also allows one to <b>clearly</b> <b>indicate</b> all relationships between the several subgroups in a cladogram. In 1999, a node clade Ichthyopterygia was defined by Motani as the group consisting of the last common ancestor of Ichthyosaurus communis, Utatsusaurus hataii and Parvinatator wapitiensis; and all its descendants. Within Motani's phylogeny, the Ichthyopterygia were the larger parent clade of a smaller stem clade Ichthyosauria that {{was defined as the}} group consisting of Ichthyosaurus communis and all species more closely related to Ichthyosaurus than to Grippia longirostris. Motani's concept of the Ichthyosauria was thus more limited than the traditional one that also contained basal forms, such as Grippia, Utatsusaurus, and Parvinatator.|$|E
25|$|These new {{developments}} mark {{a milestone in}} expanding {{the role of the}} government in improving healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans. The VHA is instituting policies that focus on individualized care. They require healthcare providers to care for gay and lesbian patients in the same respectful and sensitive manner as other patients. Another policy is to redefine the meaning of “family” and allow the gay and lesbian veterans to decide who is regarded as part of their family. As of 2014, there are many discrepancies regarding this information. The information found on medical records is often inaccurate and may not <b>clearly</b> <b>indicate</b> the choice of the veterans. The VHA has also launched educational and training programs so that healthcare providers will {{have a better understanding of}} the psychological and social distresses of the gay and lesbian veterans.|$|E
