50|$|Some progestins, mainly certain 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives, have {{glucocorticoid}} activity. This can result, at sufficiently high dosages, in {{side effects}} such as symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, steroid diabetes, adrenal suppression and insufficiency, and neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression, anxiety, and irritability. Progestins {{with the potential}} for clinically relevant glucocorticoid effects include the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives <b>chlormadinone</b> <b>acetate,</b> cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate (another 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative), in contrast, possesses no such activity.|$|E
50|$|Hydroxyprogesterone acetate (OHPA) (INN) (brand name Prodox), or 17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate, {{also known}} as 17α-acetoxyprogesterone or simply acetoxyprogesterone, is an orally active steroidal {{progestin}} related to hydroxyprogesterone caproate (OHPC) which was discovered in 1953 and was first marketed by Upjohn in the United States in 1957. It is a derivative of progesterone and the acetate ester of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, {{as well as the}} parent compound of a number of progestins including <b>chlormadinone</b> <b>acetate,</b> cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate.|$|E
50|$|Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) entered {{clinical}} use and became widely marketed, largely superseding the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone esters. A variety of analogues of medroxyprogesterone acetate, such as <b>chlormadinone</b> <b>acetate,</b> cyproterone acetate, and megestrol acetate, were subsequently developed and introduced as well. Progestogen esters {{of other groups}} of progestins have also been introduced, including the 19-norprogesterone derivatives gestonorone caproate, segesterone acetate (nestorone), nomegestrol acetate, and norgestomet (11β-methyl-17α-acetoxy-19-norprogesterone), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives etynodiol diacetate, norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, and quingestanol acetate.|$|E
50|$|As such, certain progestins, {{including}} <b>chlormadinone</b> <b>acetate,</b> cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate, {{are sometimes}} used to suppress sex hormone levels {{in a variety}} of androgen and estrogen-associated conditions. Examples of indications include treating sex hormone-sensitive cancers (e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer), benign prostatic hyperplasia, suppressing precocious puberty and puberty in transgender youth, suppressing sex hormone production in transgender patients, and reducing sex drive in sex offenders and individuals with paraphilias or hypersexuality.|$|E
50|$|DMA, {{also known}} as 1-dehydrochlormadinone acetate, as well as 1,6-didehydro-6-chloro-17α-acetoxyprogesterone or 6-chloro-17α-hydroxypregna-1,4,6-triene-3,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone with a chlorine atom at the C6 position, a double bond between the C1 and C2 positions, another double bond between the C6 and C7 positions, and an acetate ester at the C17α position. Analogues of DMA include other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as <b>chlormadinone</b> <b>acetate,</b> cyproterone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and osaterone acetate.|$|E
50|$|OHPA is of {{relatively}} low potency as a progestogen, {{which may explain}} its limited relative use. It is 100-fold less potent than medroxyprogesterone acetate, 400-fold less potent than <b>chlormadinone</b> <b>acetate,</b> and 1200-fold less potent than cyproterone acetate in animal assays. In terms of producing full progestogenic changes on the endometrium in women, 75 to 100 mg/day oral OHPA is equivalent to 20 mg/day parenteral progesterone, and OHPA is {{at least twice as}} potent as oral ethisterone in such regards. OHPA also is reportedly more potent than OHPC.|$|E
50|$|MGA, {{also known}} as 17α-acetoxy-16-methylene-6-dehydro-6-methylprogesterone or as 17α-acetoxy-16-methylene-6-methylpregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone with a methyl group at the C6 position, a methylene group at the C16 position, a double bond between the C6 and C7 positions, and an acetate ester at the C17α position. Analogues of MGA include other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as <b>chlormadinone</b> <b>acetate,</b> cyproterone acetate, delmadinone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and osaterone acetate. The only structural difference between MGA and megestrol acetate {{is the presence of}} the C16 methylene group in the former.|$|E
50|$|In {{combination}} with mestranol, similarly to ethynerone and anagestone acetate (and certain other progestogens, including progesterone {{and several other}} 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives), chloroethynylnorgestrel was found to produce striking mammary tumors in beagle dogs after administration at very high dosages (10- to 25-fold human clinical dosages) for prolonged periods of time. This resulted in the discontinuation of its development, along with that of ethynerone and anagestone acetate, {{as well as the}} removal of several progestins, including <b>chlormadinone</b> <b>acetate,</b> medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate, from various markets as contraceptives (although medroxyprogesterone acetate has since been reintroduced). Subsequent research revealed that the risk is species-dependent and unique to canines and that there is no similar risk for humans.|$|E
50|$|Osaterone acetate (brand name Ypozane; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} TZP-4238), {{also known as}} 17α-acetoxy-6-chloro-2-oxa-6-dehydroprogesterone, as well as 2-oxachloromadinone acetate, is a steroidal antiandrogen and progestogen used in veterinary medicine in Europe {{in the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in dogs. It was also investigated in Japan in the treatment of prostate cancer and BPH in humans but was never marketed for these indications. Osaterone acetate produces remission of clinical symptoms of BPH in ~83% of dogs for six months after a single one-week course of treatment, and can be used long-term. It is a 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative and a derivative of the less potent <b>chlormadinone</b> <b>acetate.</b> The drug is the C17α acetate ester of osaterone.|$|E
50|$|The most {{well-known}} and widely used antigonadotropins are the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (both agonists and antagonists). However, many other drugs have antigonadotropic properties as well, including compounds acting on sex steroid hormone receptors such as progestogens, androgens, and estrogens (due to negative {{feedback on the}} HPG axis), as well as steroid synthesis inhibitors such as danazol and gestrinone. Some antigonadotropins have a multimodal action, such as cyproterone acetate, which exerts its effects via acting as an antiandrogen, progestin, and steroid synthesis inhibitor. Since progestins have relatively little effect on sexual differentiation {{compared to the other}} sex steroids, potent ones such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and <b>chlormadinone</b> <b>acetate</b> are often used at high doses specifically for their antigonadotropic effects.|$|E
50|$|In 1966, {{during its}} {{clinical}} development, ethynerone {{was found to}} produce mammary gland tumors in dogs treated with it at very high doses for prolonged periods of time. Subsequent investigation found that 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatves included anagestone acetate, <b>chlormadinone</b> <b>acetate,</b> medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate produced similar mammary gland tumors, and that their ability to do so correlated directly with their progestogenic actions. In contrast, the non-halogenated 19-nortestosterone derivatives norgestrel, norethisterone, noretynodrel, and etynodiol diacetate, which are much less potent as progestogens, did not produce such effects at the dosages tested. Clinical development of ethynerone was discontinued, {{and many of the}} 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives were withdrawn for the indication of hormonal contraception. Research later on revealed species differences between dogs and humans and established that there is no similar risk in humans.|$|E
50|$|Antigonadotropins like estrogens and progestogens {{were both}} first {{introduced}} in the 1930s. AR antagonists were first discovered in the early 1960s. The steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate was discovered in 1961 and introduced in 1973 and {{is often described as}} the first antiandrogen to have been marketed. However, spironolactone was introduced in 1959, and although its antiandrogen effects were not recognized or taken advantage of until later and were originally an unintended off-target action of the drug, it may be more appropriate to regard it as the first antiandrogen to have been introduced. In addition to spironolactone, <b>chlormadinone</b> <b>acetate</b> and megestrol acetate are steroidal antiandrogens that are weaker than cyproterone acetate but were also introduced earlier, in the 1960s. Other early steroidal antiandrogens that were developed around this time but were never marketed include benorterone (SKF-7690; 17α-methyl-B-nortestosterone), BOMT (Ro 7-2340), cyproterone (SH-80881), and trimethyltrienolone (R-2956).|$|E
50|$|CPA is {{a potent}} {{androgen}} receptor (AR) competitive antagonist. It directly blocks endogenous androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from binding to and activating the AR, and thus prevents them from exerting their androgenic effects in the body. However, CPA, like spironolactone and other steroidal antiandrogens such as <b>chlormadinone</b> <b>acetate</b> and medroxyprogesterone acetate, is not actually a pure antagonist of the AR - that is, a silent antagonist - but rather is a very weak partial agonist. Clinically, CPA generally behaves purely as an antiandrogen, as it displaces much more efficacious endogenous androgens such as T and DHT from interacting with the receptor and thus its net effect is usually to lower physiological androgenic activity. But unlike silent antagonists of the AR such as flutamide, CPA, {{by virtue of its}} slight intrinsic activity at the receptor, is inherently incapable of fully abolishing androgenic activity in the body and will always maintain at least some degree of it.|$|E
