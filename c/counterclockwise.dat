5|$|With the cataphracts' {{attention}} fixated elsewhere, Lucullus formed two cohorts into maniples {{and then}} {{ordered them to}} ford across the river. His objective was to outflank Tigranes' cataphracts by circling <b>counterclockwise</b> around the hill and attacking them from the rear.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} I-495 (Capital Beltway) around Washington, D.C., on which exit numbers are {{generally}} arranged by mileposts <b>counterclockwise</b> {{starting at the}} southern crossing of the Potomac River, the exit numbers for the Baltimore Beltway are arranged consecutively clockwise starting at Interchange #1 at Quarantine Rd, west of the Francis Scott Key Bridge crossing of the Patapsco River.|$|E
5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the {{coordinate}} system in space, space inversion, and in time, time reversal. In the first case, the space coordinate axes are reversed. The latter is reversal of the time direction. This is thought of, in the passive view, as having the observer set their clock at minus what it shows and then have the clock's hands move <b>counterclockwise.</b> Physical time progresses forward.|$|E
5|$|The Moon and Earth orbit {{a common}} {{barycenter}} every 27.32days {{relative to the}} background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, {{the period of the}} synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all <b>counterclockwise.</b> Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a <b>counterclockwise</b> direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotating}} low continued {{along its}} northward path into the evening, bringing its <b>counterclockwise</b> winds in phase with the northwesterly winds already hitting Lakes Superior and Huron. This {{resulted in an}} explosive increase in northerly wind speeds and swirling snow. Ships on Lake Huron that were south of Alpena, Michigan—especially around Harbor Beach and Port Huron in Michigan and Goderich and Sarnia in Ontario—were battered with massive waves moving southward toward St. Clair River.|$|E
5|$|The three {{variants}} of the Penrose tiling are mutually locally derivable. Selecting some subsets from the vertices of a P1 tiling allows to produce other non-periodic tilings. If {{the corners of}} one pentagon in P1 are labeled in succession by 1,3,5,2,4 an unambiguous tagging in all the pentagons is established, the order being either clockwise or <b>counterclockwise.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm developed east of Nicaragua on May25, executing a <b>counterclockwise</b> loop over Central America. After weakening over land, Alice re-intensified over the western Caribbean, moving over western Cuba on May 21 with winds of 50mph (80km/h). On June1, it entered the Gulf of Mexico, and later executed another loop off the northwest coast of Cuba. Alice quickly weakened {{due to a}} cold front, and advisories were discontinued by June3. While near Cuba, Alice produced drought-breaking rainfall that caused flooding and several unofficial drowning deaths.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly <b>counterclockwise.</b> Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E
5|$|High-pressure systems, {{also known}} as anticyclones, rotate outward at the surface and {{clockwise}} in the northern hemisphere as opposed to outward and <b>counterclockwise</b> in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, sinking of the atmosphere slightly warms the air by compression, leading to clearer skies, winds that are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.|$|E
5|$|Initially, many {{physicists}} {{hoped that}} by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, {{it might be}} possible to construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world. The hope was that such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. Interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered. One of the problems was that the laws of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and <b>counterclockwise,</b> a phenomenon known as chirality. Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions.|$|E
5|$|One notable Dream Shake {{happened}} in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With David Robinson guarding him, Olajuwon performed a cross-over, {{drove to the}} basket and faked a layup. Robinson, an excellent defender, kept up with Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun <b>counterclockwise</b> and faked a jump shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup.|$|E
5|$|The intense <b>counterclockwise</b> {{rotation}} of the low was made apparent by the changing wind directions around its center. In Buffalo, New York, morning northwest winds had shifted to northeast by noon and were blowing southeast by 5:00p.m., with the fastest gusts, 80mph (130km/h), occurring between 1:00p.m. and 2:00p.m. Just 180miles (290km) to the southwest, in Cleveland, winds remained northwest during the day, shifting to the west by 5:00p.m., and maintaining speeds of more than 50mph (80km/h). The fastest gust in Cleveland, 79mph (127km/h), occurred at 4:40p.m. There was a dramatic drop in barometric pressure at Buffalo, from 29.52inHg (999.7hPa) at 8:00a.m. to 28.77inHg (974.3hPa) at 8:00p.m.|$|E
5|$|The same {{algebraic}} equations can {{be derived}} {{in the context of}} Lie sphere geometry. That geometry represents circles, lines and points in a unified way, as a five-dimensional vector X = (v, c'x, c'y, w, sr), where c = (c'x, c'y) is the center of the circle, and r is its (non-negative) radius. If r is not zero, the sign s may be positive or negative; for visualization, s represents the orientation of the circle, with <b>counterclockwise</b> circles having a positive s and clockwise circles having a negative s. The parameter w is zero for a straight line, and one otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The season's first {{storm had}} limited {{reported}} impacts on land, {{and the subsequent}} system caused more severe damage in southern Texas and northern Mexico. Hurricane Three dropped torrential rainfall on Puerto Rico before striking the same region as the previous cyclone. Hurricane Four bypassed Bermuda to the east, where some property damage was reported. Hurricane Five was the most catastrophic storm of the season, buffeting western Cuba {{for an extended period}} of time as it slowly executed a <b>counterclockwise</b> loop. Death tolls from the hurricane are estimated in the hundreds.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{normally}} rotate cyclonically (when {{viewed from}} above, this is <b>counterclockwise</b> {{in the northern}} hemisphere and clockwise in the southern). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the Coriolis effect, thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is unimportant, as indicated by their large Rossby numbers. Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. Low-level mesocyclones and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{attaining}} typhoon status, Pamela {{was a small}} {{tropical cyclone}} with a central dense overcast spanning 280km (175mi) in diameter. After completing its <b>counterclockwise</b> loop, the typhoon began a slow motion to the northwest, once the ridge to its west diminished. On May18, it passed within 95km (60mi) of Chuuk, and around that time Pamela developed a circular eye about 18km (12mi) in diameter. The typhoon steadily intensified as it began a more steady northwest movement due to a ridge to its east, and on May19 Pamela attained peak winds of 240km/h (150mph) about 485km (300mi) southeast of Guam. At that time, it had gusts to 295km/h (185mph).|$|E
5|$|As Delia {{neared the}} Texas coastline, it managed to intensify into a strong {{tropical}} storm with winds of 70mph (110km/h) and reconnaissance reported winds well {{in excess of}} hurricane-force in numerous squalls associated with the storm. The lowest pressure was recorded at 986mbar (hPa; 29.11inHg). However, Delia was not classified a hurricane as it had not developed an eyewall around the center of circulation. Delia subsequently made its first landfall at Freeport, Texas late on September4. After executing a <b>counterclockwise</b> loop, the storm made its second landfall in Freeport on September5. After moving inland, the storm quickly weakened, becoming a depression on September6 before dissipating early the next day over northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|For {{about six}} days, Ginger {{maintained}} minimal hurricane status. As it meandered over the central Atlantic Ocean, it maintained {{an unusually large}} eye, reaching 80 mi (130 km) in diameter. On September 18, Ginger turned {{to the south and}} slowly executed a tight <b>counterclockwise</b> loop within three days. By September 21, the hurricane was tracking south of due west, and the next day suddenly intensified to winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Its westward track briefly posed a threat to Bermuda, although Ginger passed 115 mi (185 km) south of the island on September 23 while slowly weakening. On September 24, Ginger decelerated before beginning a turn to the southwest. By September 26, Ginger briefly weakened to minimal hurricane strength, although re-intensification resumed as the track turned to the west and northwest. Around that time, Ginger absorbed the smaller and weaker Tropical Storm Janice to its southeast.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters at the JTWC {{initially}} projected {{the storm}} to track north of Taiwan on September12 and merge with an approaching frontal system. Contrary to this, Sarah moved {{south of the}} expected path and quickly weakened as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Taiwan. The storm eventually struck the island with winds of 165km/h (105mph) late on September11. Unexpectedly, the typhoon executed a <b>counterclockwise</b> loop and briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall 12hours later along the northeastern coast of Taiwan as a tropical storm. Sarah failed to reorganize as it moved over the Taiwan Strait and later made its final landfall in Zhejiang, China as a minimal tropical storm on September13. The storm was last noted the following day as dissipating over Eastern China.|$|E
5|$|Iridion 3D {{features}} five {{types of}} weapons, with {{three levels of}} power each. Players boost weapon power by collecting powerups of the color that matches the current weapon. Collecting a different color gives the player the first level of that weapon type. If the player's ship is destroyed the power level of the weapon is reduced by one. Each weapon has advantages and disadvantages. The player starts with the red weapon, which is relatively weak but fires rapidly in a large spread. Green weapons are inaccurate but fill the screen with shots. Purple weapons spin in a <b>counterclockwise</b> motion slowly and are fairly strong. Yellow torpedo-like weapons are very powerful but powerups are rare and the weapon fires slowly. Blue weapons, a more powerful version of Yellow weapons, are found only on the last level. Flashing powerups restore the craft's shields.|$|E
5|$|On October14, a {{tropical}} depression was first observed over the western Caribbean Sea, {{just off the}} eastern Honduras coast. It was a large and weak tropical cyclone, moving slowly northwestward and gradually intensifying. On October15, it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status, and its strengthening became more steady. The next day, the storm reached hurricane status about 130mi (215km) southeast of Cozumel, Quintana Roo. Around that time, it began to execute a small <b>counterclockwise</b> loop off {{the east coast of}} the Yucatán Peninsula. By October18 the hurricane completed the loop, during which its winds increased to 115mph (185km/h); this is the equivalence of a major hurricane, or a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The estimation of its strength at this point was based on subsequent analysis of peripheral recordings of atmospheric pressure and maximum sustained winds by ships and land stations.|$|E
5|$|Steered by {{currents}} {{from an area}} of {{high pressure}} to the north, the storm began to drift northwestward and rapidly deepen over warm waters of the Gulf. It executed a tight <b>counterclockwise</b> loop, and continued to mature; on October 16 it reached peaked winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) with a minimum barometric pressure of 924 mbar (hPa; 27.29 inHg). The hurricane turned northeastward, again approaching western Cuba, and began to accelerate towards the Florida Peninsula on October 17. Its center passed west of Key West and made landfall near Cape Romano. The storm moved due north for a time as it moved inland, and deteriorated into a tropical storm. From northeastern Florida, the cyclone curved northeastward and hugged {{the coast of the}} Southeast United States before heading out to sea. The storm is estimated to have dissipated on October 23.|$|E
5|$|The 1910Cuba hurricane, {{popularly known}} as the Cyclone of the Five Days, was an unusual and {{destructive}} tropical cyclone that struck Cuba and the United States in October1910. It formed in the southern Caribbean on October9 and strengthened as it moved northwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 12. After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked in intensity on October16, corresponding to Category4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. That same day, the hurricane moved in a <b>counterclockwise</b> loop and hit Cuba again. It then tracked toward Florida, landing near Cape Romano. After moving through the state, it hugged {{the coast of the}} Southeastern United States on its way out to sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back <b>counterclockwise</b> {{near the surface}} of the Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary layer, sometimes the Ekman layer, and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft, and is most emphasized at night.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hurricane}} of the season, Able, formed {{prior to}} the official start of the season; before reanalysis in 2015, it was once listed as the earliest major hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin. It formed on May16 and executed a <b>counterclockwise</b> loop over the Bahamas; later it brushed the North Carolina coastline. Hurricane Charlie was a powerful Category4 hurricane that struck Jamaica as a major hurricane, killing hundreds and becoming the worst disaster in over 50years. The hurricane later struck Mexico twice as a major hurricane, producing deadly flooding outside of Tampico, Tamaulipas. The strongest hurricane, Easy, spent its duration over the open Atlantic Ocean, briefly threatening Bermuda, and was formerly listed {{as one of a}} relatively few Category5 hurricanes on record over the Atlantic Ocean. It briefly neared Category5 status and interacted with Hurricane Fox, marking the first known instance of a hurricane affecting another's path.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Delia was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone on record to make landfall {{in the same city}} twice. Forming out of a tropical wave on September1, 1973, Delia gradually strengthened into a tropical storm as it moved north by September3. After reaching this strength, the storm turned more westward and further intensified, nearly attaining hurricane status the next day. The storm peaked with winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a barometric pressure of 986mbar (hPa; 29.11inHg). Several hours later, Delia made landfall near Freeport, Texas; however, the storm began to execute a <b>counterclockwise</b> loop, causing it to move back over the Gulf of Mexico. On September5, the storm made another landfall in Freeport before weakening to a depression. The remnants of Delia eventually dissipated early on September7 over northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|As planned, <b>counterclockwise</b> trains, to {{and from}} Jamaica and Howard Beach, would have run every 2 minutes during peak hours, for a {{frequency}} of 30 trains per hour (tph). Each branch would have been served by a train every four minutes, or 15 tph. The final environmental impact statement planned for even higher frequencies of 40 tph, or a train every 90 seconds in the central terminal area. However, , actual frequencies were much lower, with each branch being served by one train every 7 to 12 minutes during peak hours, or 5 to 8.5 tph. During middays, trains come every 10 to 15 minutes, with 4 to 6 tph on each branch. Late night service is less frequent: trains come every 15 to 20 minutes, with 3 to 4 tph on each branch. Weekend service is similar to night service, with trains coming every 16 minutes, or 4 tph on each branch. Trains make the journey between the terminals and either Jamaica or Howard Beach in about eight minutes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the behest}} of the Paris Observatory under le Verrier, Marie Alfred Cornu {{repeated}} Fizeau's 1848 toothed wheel measurement in a series of experiments in 1872–76. The goal was to obtain a value for the speed of light accurate to one part in a thousand. Cornu's equipment allowed him to monitor high orders of extinction, up to the 21st order. Instead of estimating the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, a relatively inaccurate procedure, Cornu made pairs of observations {{on either side of the}} intensity minima, averaging the values obtained with the wheel spun clockwise and <b>counterclockwise.</b> An electric circuit recorded the wheel rotations on a chronograph chart which enabled precise rate comparisons against the observatory clock, and a telegraph key arrangement allowed Cornu to mark on this same chart the precise moments when he judged that an extinction had been entered or exited. His final experiment was run over a path nearly three times as long as that used by Fizeau, and yielded a figure of 300400km/s that is within 0.2% of the modern value.|$|E
5|$|Clearing Johnston Atoll, John {{turned to}} the {{northwest}} and began strengthening again as shear decreased. On August 27 local time, John reached a secondary peak strength of 135 miles per hour (210 km/h), and shortly thereafter it crossed the International Date Line at approximately 22° N and came under the surveillance of the Guam branch of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). By crossing into the western Pacific, John also became a typhoon and {{was referred to as}} Typhoon John during its time in the western Pacific. Immediately after crossing the Date Line, John again weakened and its forward motion stalled. By September 1, John had weakened to a tropical storm and was nearly motionless just west of the Date Line. There, John lingered for six days while performing a multi-day <b>counterclockwise</b> loop. On September 7, a trough moved into the area and quickly moved John to the northeast. John crossed the Date Line again on September 8 and reentered the central Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Karl {{originated}} {{in a low}} pressure area that formed along a frontal boundary near the southeastern United States. It approached the Canadian Maritimes {{the next day and}} strengthened to below 1000 millibars. On November 24, the broad cyclone was located south of Newfoundland, and early the next day a mass of convection developed near the core. It evolved into a separate vortex, and {{due to the lack of}} inhibiting wind shear, a small cyclone developed. It became a subtropical storm at 0000 UTC before executing a tight <b>counterclockwise</b> loop as it rotated within the larger cyclone. About 18 hours later, the storm strengthened and gained enough tropical characteristics to be designated a hurricane, accompanied by the formation of a pronounced eye feature. At the time, it was situated around 610miles (1,110km) west-southwest of the Azores. Although the development of a tropical cyclone within a non-tropical storm is rare, it is not unprecedented. An unnamed hurricane in November 1991 also formed in this manner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of Avon, West Main feeds into Park Place, a large traffic circle {{providing}} access to two local streets from US20 and NY5. The routes follow the circle <b>counterclockwise,</b> departing the roundabout on East Main Street. The street proceeds east, passing through four blocks of densely populated neighborhoods before exiting the village and abruptly entering vast, barren fields to the east. US20 and NY5, now named Avon–Lima Road, intersects NY15 two miles (3km) to the east in East Avon, a community based around the intersection and the streets comprising it, and connects to I-390 at exit10 a half-mile from NY15. Continuing on, the road intersects a number of county routes {{over the next four}} miles (6km) before becoming West Main Street once more, this time for the village of Lima. At an intersection with NY15A in the village center, US20 and NY5 become East Main Street, retaining the name to the Ontario County line at Honeoye Creek.|$|E
