In this study, we determined gestational age-dependent expression profiles for all metabolic enzyme and transporter genes in the maternal liver, kidney, small intestine, and placenta of pregnant mice by micro-array analysis. We specifically examined the expression of genes important for xenobiotic, bile acid, and steroid hormone metabolism and disposition, namely, cytochrome P 450 s (Cyp), UDP-glucuronosyltranserases (Ugt), sulfotransferases (Sult), and ATP-binding <b>cassette</b> (Abc), solute <b>carrier</b> (Slc), and solute carrier organic anion (Slco) transporters. Few Ugt and Sult genes were affected by pregnancy. Cyp 17 a 1 expression in the maternal liver increased 3 - to 10 -fold during pregnancy, which was the largest observe...|$|R

The type and orientation of the carbon-fiber weave can be designed to maximize stiffness in required directions. Frames can be tuned to address different riding styles: sprint events require stiffer frames while endurance events may require more flexible frames for rider comfort over longer periods. The variety of shapes it can be built into has further increased stiffness and also allowed aerodynamic tube sections. CFRP forks including suspension fork crowns and steerers, handlebars, seatposts, and crank arms are becoming more common on medium as well as higher-priced bicycles. CFRP rims remain expensive but their stability compared to aluminium reduces the need to re-true a wheel and the reduced mass reduces the moment of inertia of the wheel. CFRP spokes are rare and most carbon wheelsets retain traditional stainless steel spokes. CFRP also appears increasingly in other components such as derailleur parts, brake and shifter levers and bodies, <b>cassette</b> sprocket <b>carriers,</b> suspension linkages, disc brake rotors, pedals, shoe soles, and saddle rails. Although strong and light, impact, over-torquing or improper installation of CFRP components has resulted in cracking and failures, which may be difficult or impossible to repair.|$|R
40|$|Many key {{aspects of}} plant {{development}} are regulated by the polarized transport of the phytohormone auxin. Cellular auxin efflux, the rate-limiting step in this process, {{has been shown to}} rely on the coordinated action of PIN-formed (PIN) and B-type ATP binding <b>cassette</b> (ABCB) <b>carriers.</b> Here, we report that polar auxin transport in the Arabidopsis thaliana root also requires the action of a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) transporter, Zinc-Induced Facilitator-Like 1 (ZIFL 1). Sequencing, promoter-reporter, and fluorescent protein fusion experiments indicate that the full-length ZIFL 1. 1 protein and a truncated splice isoform, ZIFL 1. 3, localize to the tonoplast of root cells and the plasma membrane of leaf stomatal guard cells, respectively. Using reverse genetics, we show that the ZIFL 1. 1 transporter regulates various root auxin-related processes, while the ZIFL 1. 3 isoform mediates drought tolerance by regulating stomatal closure. Auxin transport and immunolocalization assays demonstrate that ZIFL 1. 1 indirectly modulates cellular auxin efflux during shootward auxin transport at the root tip, likely by regulating plasma membrane PIN 2 abundance. Finally, heterologous expression in yeast revealed that ZIFL 1. 1 and ZIFL 1. 3 share H(+) -coupled K(+) transport activity. Thus, by determining the subcellular and tissue distribution of two isoforms, alternative splicing dictates a dual function for the ZIFL 1 transporter. We propose that this MFS carrier regulates stomatal movements and polar auxin transport by modulating potassium and proton fluxes in Arabidopsis cells.

40|$|Background: Insects evolved ingenious {{adaptations to}} use {{extraordinary}} food sources. Particularly, the diet of herbivores enriched with noxious plant secondary metabolites requires detoxification mechanisms. Sequestration, which involves the uptake, transfer, and concentration of occasionally modified phytochemicals into specialized tissues or hemolymph, {{is one of}} the most successful detoxification strategies found in most insect orders. Due to the ability of ATP-binding <b>cassette</b> (ABC) <b>carriers</b> to transport a wide range of molecules including phytochemicals and xenobiotics, it is highly likely that they play a role in this sequestration process. To shed light on the role of ABC proteins in sequestration, we describe an inventory of putative ABC transporters in various tissues in the sequestering juvenile poplar leaf beetle, Chrysomela populi. Results: In the transcriptome of C. populi, we predicted 65 ABC transporters. To link the proteins with a possible function, we performed comparative phylogenetic analyses with ABC transporters of other insects and of humans. While tissue-specific profiling of each ABC transporter subfamily suggests that ABCB, C and G influence the plant metabolite absorption in the gut, ABCC with 14 members is the preferred subfamily responsible for the excretion of these metabolites via Malpighian tubules. Moreover, salicin, which is sequestered from poplar plants, is translocated into the defensive glands for further deterrent production. In these glands and among all identified ABC transporters, an exceptionally high transcript level was observed only for Cpabc 35 (Cpmrp).

40|$|International audienceIntroduction: Drug {{transporters}} are {{now recognized}} as major players involved in pharmacokinetics and toxicology. Methods for assessing their activity {{are important to}} consider, particularly owing to regulatory requirements with respect to inhibition of drug transporter activity and prediction of drug–drug interactions. In this context, the use of fluorescent-dye-based transport assays is likely to deserve attention. Areas covered: This review {{provides an overview of}} the nature of fluorescent dye substrates for ATP-binding <b>cassette</b> and solute <b>carrier</b> drug transporters. Their use for investigating drug transporter activity in cultured cells and clinical hematological samples, drug transporter inhibition, drug transporter imaging and drug transport at the organ level are summarized. Expert opinion: A wide range of fluorescent dyes is now available for use in various aspects of drug transporter studies. The use of these dyes for transporter analyses may, however, be hampered by classic pitfalls of fluorescence technology, such as quenching. Transporter-independent processes such as passive diffusion of dyes through plasma membrane or dye sequestration into subcellular compartments must also be considered, as well as the redundant handling by various distinct transporters of some fluorescent probes. Finally, standardization of dye-based transport assays remains an important on-going issu...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Drug {{transporters}} {{are large}} transmembrane proteins which catalyse {{the movement of}} a wide variety of chemicals, including drugs as well as xeno- and endobiotics through cellular membranes. The major groups of these proteins include the ATP-binding cassette transporters which in eukaryotes work as ATP-fuelled drug exporters and the Solute Carrier transporters, with various transport directions and mechanisms. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the key ATP-binding <b>cassette</b> and Solute <b>Carrier</b> drug transporters which have been reported to contribute to the function and/or protection of undifferentiated human stem cells and during tissue differentiation. We review the various techniques for studying transporter expression and function in stem cells, and the role of drug transporters in foetal and placental tissues is also discussed. We especially focus on the regulation of transporter expression by factors modulating cell differentiation properties and on the function of the transporters in adjustment to environmental challenges. Expert opinion: The relatively new and as yet unexplored territory of transporters in stem cell biology may rapidly expand and bring important new information regarding the metabolic and epigenetic regulation of stemness and the early differentiation properties. Drug transporters are clearly important protective and regulatory components in stem cells and differentiation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|There are {{considerable}} interindividual {{variations in}} drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) in humans, which {{may lead to}} undesired drug effects in pharmacotherapy. Some of the mechanistic causes are known, e. g., genetic polymorphism, inhibition and induction of ADME enzymes and transporters, while others such as posttranscriptional regulation of ADME genes are under active study. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {{a large group of}} small, noncoding RNAs that control posttranscriptional expression of target genes. More than 1000 miRNAs have been identified in the human genome, which may regulate thousands of protein-coding genes. Some miRNAs directly or indirectly control the expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing cytochrome P 450 enzymes, ATP-binding <b>cassette</b> or solute <b>carrier</b> transporters and/or nuclear receptors. Consequently, intervention of miRNA epigenetic signaling may alter ADME gene expression, change the capacity of drug metabolism and transport, and influence the sensitivity of cells to xenobiotics. In addition, the expression of some ADME regulatory miRNAs is significantly changed in cells following the exposure to a given drug, and the consequent changes in ADME gene expression might result in distinct ADME properties and drug response. In this review, we summarized recent findings on the role of noncoding miRNAs in epigenetic regulation of ADME genes and discussed the potential impact on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics...|$|R
40|$|Renal tubular {{handling}} of urate is realized by {{a network of}} uptake and efflux transporters, including members of drug transporter families such as solute carrier proteins and ATP-binding <b>cassette</b> transporters. Solute <b>carrier</b> family 2, member 9 (SLC 2 A 9), is one key factor of this so called "urate transportosome. " The aim {{of the present study}} was to understand the transcriptional regulation of SLC 2 A 9 and to test whether identified factors might contribute to a coordinated transcriptional regulation of the transporters involved in urate handling. In silico analysis and cell-based reporter gene assays identified a hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4 α-binding site in the promoter of SLC 2 A 9 isoform 1, whose activity was enhanced by transient HNF 4 α overexpression, whereas mutation of the binding site diminished activation. HNF 4 α overexpression induced endogenous SLC 2 A 9 expression in vitro. The in vivo role of HNF 4 α in the modulation of renal SLC 2 A 9 gene expression was supported by findings of quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Indeed, mRNA expression of SLC 2 A 9 and HNF 4 α in human kidney samples was significantly correlated. We also showed that in renal clear cell carcinoma, downregulation of HNF 4 α mRNA and protein expression was associated with a significant decline in expression of the transporter. Taken together, our data suggest that nuclear receptor family member HNF 4 α contributes to the transcriptional regulation of SLC 2 A 9 isoform 1. Since HNF 4 α has previously been assumed to be a modulator of several urate transporters, our findings support the notion that there could be a transcriptional network providing synchronized regulation of the functional network of the urate transportosome...|$|R
40|$|P-glycoprotein (P-gp – MDR- 1), a 170 kDa glycosylated {{membrane}} bound protein, is {{a member}} of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family. The potential for P-gp to reduce drug absorption across lung epithelia is of significant interest; this is particularly so, given P-gp’s broad substrate specificity mediating efflux transport of a range of structurally unrelated substrates. Within lung, Pgp expression is evident in bronchial and alveolar epithelia with functional characterisation of P-gp transport capacity within lung epithelial cells currently restricted to respective in-vitro cell culture models. The aims of this project were to establish the relative mRNA expression of several ATP Binding <b>Cassette</b> (ABC), Solute <b>Carrier</b> (SLC) and Solute Carrier Organic Anion (SLCO) drug transporters within rat lung samples through use of RT-PCR; expression suggesting the potential to serve as targets for pulmonary drug delivery. Further, validation of an Isolated Perfused Rat Lung preparation for use in assessment of drug transport across the lung was conducted. In order to assess the functional significance of the ABC drug transporter, P-glycoprotein, on drugs instilled intra-tracheally to the IPRL set-up, use of the P-gp substrates; Rhodamine 123 (Rh 123), digoxin, and flunisolide and the P-gp inhibitor, GF 120918 was employed. Further, use of kinetic modelling was employed to establish pharmacokinetic parameters involved. Using the IPRL, the P-gp dependent pulmonary absorption of the P-gp substrate, Rh 123, was demonstrated. Dose-dependent absorption, consistent with a saturable component in the molecule’s pulmonary absorption, was demonstrated. Further, the absorption of low dose Rh 123 was promoted by the presence of the highly selective P-gp inhibitor GF 120918, consistent with a functional role of P-gp mediated efflux within an intact lung; an efflux process which may limit the pulmonary absorption of a lung administered molecule. Further studies using this system and extending the range of molecules studied will provide greater understanding of the quantitative significance of P-gp in limiting pulmonary absorption across lung epithelium.

40|$|Angiotensin {{converting}} enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lisinopril and ramipril {{were selected}} from EMA/ 480197 / 2010 and the potassium-sparing diuretic spironolactone was selected from the NHS specials list for November 2011 drug tariff with the view to produce oral liquid formulations providing dosage forms targeting paediatrics. Lisinopril, ramipril and spironolactone were chosen for their interaction with transporter proteins in the small intestine. Formulation limitations such as poor solubility or pH sensitivity needed consideration. Lisinopril was formulated without extensive development as drug and excipients were water soluble. Ramipril and spironolactone are both insoluble in water and strategies combating this were employed. Ramipril was successfully solubilised using low concentrations of acetic acid in a co-solvent system and also via complexation with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin. A ramipril suspension was produced to take formulation development in a third direction. Spironolactone dosages were too high for solubilisation techniques to be effective so suspensions were developed. A buffer controlled pH for the sensitive drug whilst a precisely balanced surfactant and suspending agent mix provided excellent physical stability. Characterisation, stability profiling and permeability assessment were performed following formulation development. The formulation process highlighted current shortcomings in techniques for taste assessment of pharmaceutical preparations resulting in early stage research into a novel in vitro cell based assay. The formulations developed in the initial phase of the research were used as model formulations investigating microarray application in an in vitro-in vivo correlation for carrier mediated drug absorption. Caco- 2 cells were assessed following transport studies for changes in genetic expression of the ATP-binding <b>cassette</b> and solute <b>carrier</b> transporter superfamilies. Findings of which were compared to in vitro and in vivo permeability findings.
