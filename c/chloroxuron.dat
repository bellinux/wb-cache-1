40|$|O controle de plantas daninhas e a tolerância de gladíolos, cultivares Spick and Span e White Friendship, a tratamentos herbicidas foi estudado em um experimento de campo em solo areno-argiloso. Foram aplicados os herbicidas {{trifluralin}} e EPTC em pré-plantio com incorporação e <b>chloroxuron,</b> DCPA, diphenamid, pendimethalin e diuron em pré -emergência. Houve maior incidência de gramíneas que foram controladas por todos os herbicidas, exceto <b>chloroxuron,</b> sendo o controle pelo EPTC de 83 % e pelos demais, acima de 90 %. Para as dicotiledóneas, o controle foi na seguinte ordem decrescente: pendimethalin, <b>chloroxuron,</b> diuron, trifluralin, EPTC, DCPA e diphenamid. O EPTC afetou a germinação de bulbos, causando, também, retenção de crescimento e atraso no ciclo. No florescimento, as hastes florais foram colhidas, medidas e pesadas, verificando-se redução significativa de peso de matéria fresca com o tratamento EPTC para o cultivar Spick and Span, e com trifluralin, EPTC, <b>chloroxuron</b> e pendimetha lin para o White Friendship. The {{weed control}} by herbicides {{and their effects}} on gladioli was evaluated on a field experiment on sandy-loam soil on CV Spick and Span and White Friendship. Trifluralin and EPTC were applied pre-plant incorporated and <b>chloroxuron,</b> DCPA, diphenamid, pendim et halin and diuron in pre-emergence. Grass species were predominant {{in the area and}} were controled by all herbicides except <b>chloroxuron.</b> Control by EPTC was of 83 % and over 90 % by all others. The broadleaves were controled in the following decrescent order: pendimethalin, <b>chloroxuron,</b> diuron, trifluralin, EPTC, DCPA and diphenamid. Only EPTC affected the sprouting of bulbs, causing also growth retention and delaying of flower set. The flowers stems were cut off a the opening of the first flower, measured and weighted. EPTC caused significant reduction in weight of CV Spick and Span and trifluralin, EPTC, <b>chloroxuron</b> and pendimethalin of CV White Friendship...|$|E

40|$|Duas variedades de quiabeiro foram testadas, em condições de casa de vegetação, com solo de textura areno-barrenta, na sua tolerância para 16 herbicidas, cada qual aplicado em uma única dose. Dentre os herbicidas aplicados em pré-plantio incorporado o triflu-ralin destacou-se no combate às ervas daninhas gramíneas e não causou nenhum dano para a planta do quiabeiro. Os herbicidas cloroxuron, linuron, norea e {{propachlor}} mostraram ótimos resultados no cambate às ervas más e quanto à tolerância dessa malvácea. Do grupo das triazinas, todos os herbicidas usados nas condições do teste provocaram danos para o quiabeiro. Two okra (Hibiscus esculentus L.) varieties {{were tested}} for their tolerance to sixteen herbicides at one rate each, as a pre-planting {{and as a}} pre-emergence applications in greenhouse trials. The results with the incorporated herbicides showed that only tri-fluralin at 0, 75 kg/ha active ingredient was promising to this crop. Different results were obtained with the pre-emergence applications {{of the group of}} urea and anilide herbicides. While no symptoms of injury were observed with <b>chloroxuron,</b> norea, linuron, and propachlor, injury symptoms were evident with diuron, fluometuron, metobromuron and siduron. The four triazine herbicides were very damaging to the okra plants. Under the conditions of these tests, only the herbicides trifluralin, <b>chloroxuron,</b> norea, and linuron were promising to the okra crop...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the soil fungus Rhizoctonia solani to degrade phenyl-substituted urea {{herbicides}} was investigated. The fungus was able to transform chlorbromuron [3 -(3 -chloro- 4 -bromophenyl) - 1 -methyl- 1 -methoxyurea] to the demethylated product [3 -(3 -chloro- 4 -bromophenyl) - 1 -methoxyurea], which was isolated and identified. Evidence was obtained that further degradation of chlorbromuron occurred. Several other phenylurea compounds (<b>chloroxuron,</b> diuron, fenuron, fluometuron, linuron, metobromuron, neburon, and siduron) were also metabolized by the fungus, indicating that R. solani may possess a generalized ability to attack this group of herbicides...|$|E
40|$|Pesticide {{residues}} {{are determined}} by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using the Hill reaction as a detection method. Tomatoes samples without pesticide were fortified with atrazine, diuron, <b>chloroxuron</b> and metribuzin, and were applyed in silica gel plates {{with the help of}} a microsyringe. The pesticides were elued with ethyl acetate. There was no need of cleaning up because no interference was noticed. After the revelation of the plates, the diameters of the spots were measure by using a rule. The range of the determined concentration for all the pesticides was from 0. 1 to 1. 0 ng/muL. The results obtained through TLC can be used for semi-quantitative analysis. The results obtained were compared to gas and liquid chromatography, showing good agreement between both techniques...|$|E
40|$|A method {{based on}} on-line preconcentration {{followed}} by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (LCESI– MS/MS) {{was developed for}} the determination of three sulfonyl-urea (thifensulfuron, metsulfuron, chlorsulfuron) and two phenyl-urea (isoproturon and chlortoluron) herbicides in water at sub-ppb concentration ranges. Preconcentration was accomplished using on-line enrichment on a C 18 cartridge; the procedure was optimized by {{an evaluation of the}} breakthrough volumes for the target analytes. Subsequently, LC-ESI–MS/MS was adopted for analytes separation and detection. In particular, a selective reaction monitoring (SRM) approach, based on the detection of a peculiar fragment for each analyte, was chosen for MS/MS analysis, in order to enhance selectivity. Normalization to the response of a phenyl-urea herbicide (<b>chloroxuron),</b> used as an internal standard, was also adopted to achieve a reproducibility enhancement. The described method was applied to the analysis of the target analytes in river water samples and LOD values ranging between 8 and 30 ppt were obtained...|$|E
40|$|Foram instalados dois experimentos de campo, um com alho 'Lavínia' e outro com cebola 'Monte Alegre' e 'Roxa do Traviú', para estudar a eficiência de controle e a seletividade de herbicidas. Na cultura do alho, havia os seguintes tratamentos: {{pendimethalin}} a 1, 50 kg/ha, linuron a 1, 00 kg/ha e oxadiazon a 1, 00 kg/ha, aplicados no dia do plantio; ioxinil a 0, 50 e 0, 75 kg/ha, ioxinil + oxadiazon a 0, 75 + 0, 25 kg/ha e 0, 50 + 0, 50 kg/ha, aplicados em pós-emergência, testemunhas com e sem cultivo e com palha seca. Ocorreu uma população mista de mato com predomínio de beldroega. Em contagens realizadas aos 48 e 84 dias, verificou-se excelente controle de dicotiledôneas por todos os tratamentos. Ioxinil só ou em mistura com oxadiazon, em pós-emergência, não controlou gramíneas. Nenhum tratamento herbicida reduziu o número de plantas de alho, ocorrendo os menores valores com as testemunhas com mato e com palha. As produções, em peso, de bulbos ocorreram na seguinte ordem decrescente: testemunha capinada >oxadiazon >ioxinil + oxadiazon a 0, 50 + 0, 50 = pendimethalin = testemunha com palha = ioxinil + oxadiazon a 0, 75 + 0, 25 kg > linuron > ioxinil a 0, 75 kg >ioxinil a 0, 50 kg > testemunha com mato. Na cultura da cebola, havia os seguintes tratamentos: pendimethalin a 1, 50 kg/ha, linuron a 1, 00 kg, oxadiazon a 1, 00 kg e <b>chloroxuron</b> a 4, 00 kg, aplicados no dia do transplantio; ioxinil a 0, 50 kg e 0, 75 kg, oxadiazon + ioxinil a 0, 75 + 0, 25 kg, idem a 1, 00 + 0, 25 kg e a 1, 00 + 1, 00 kg, e linuron a 1, 00 kg, todos aplicados 32 dias após o transplantio, testemunhas com e sem capina. Ocorreu uma população predominante de dicotiledôneas com maior frequência de beldroega e de quenopódio. A avaliação, realizada aos 48 dias, mostrou excelente controle de dicotiledôneas por todos os tratamentos, com valores acima de 95 %. O ioxinil, só ou em mistura com oxadiazon, não controlou gramíneas, e o <b>chloroxuron</b> apresentou o menor controle geral, mas ainda satisfatório. O oxadiazon em PRÉ e o linuron em PÓS foram os mais eficientes no controle de gramíneas. Não houve diferenças entre as produções de cebola nos diferentes tratamentos. Two {{field trials}} with garlic 'Lavínia' and onion 'Monte Alegre' and 'Roxa do Traviú' {{were performed on}} a loamy soil to study herbicide selectivity and their efficiency on weed control. The following treatments were studied on garlic: pendimethalin at 1. 50 kg/ha; linuron at 1. 00 kg/ha and oxadiazon at 1. 00 kg/ha, applied in pre-emergence at the planting day; ioxynil at 0. 50 and 0. 75 kg/ha, ioxynil + oxadiazon at 0. 75 + 0, 25 kg/ha and 0. 50 + 0. 50 kg/ha, applied 35 days after, weeded and hoed checks and a check with mulch. The weed population {{was a mixture of}} various types of weeds; predominated by Portucala oleracea L. Weed control was evaluated at 48 and 84 days. All treatments controlled very well the dicotyledons. Ioxynil alone or mixed with oxadiazon in post-emergence did not control grasses. None of the herbicide treatments reduced the garlic stand, occurring the lowest number on the checks with weeds and mulch. The yields occurred in the following: hoed check > oxadiazon > ioxynil + oxadiazon at 0. 50 + 0. 50 kg/ha = pendimethalin = mulch = ioxynil + oxadiazon at 0. 75 + 0. 25 kg/ha > linuron > ioxynil at 0. 75 kg/ha > ioxynil at 0. 50 kg/ha > weeded check. On the onion crop the following treatments were studied: pendimethalin at 1. 50 kg/ha, linuron at 1. 00 kg/ha, oxadiazon at 1. 00 kg/ha, and <b>chloroxuron</b> at 4. 00 kg/ha, applied in pre-emergence on the day of transplanting; ioxynil at 0. 50 and 0. 75 kg/ha, oxadiazon + ioxynil at 0. 75 + 0. 25 kg/ha, at 1. 00 + 0. 25 kg/ha and at 1. 00 + 1. 00 kg/ha and linuron at 1. 00 kg/ha, all applied 32 days after, weeded and hoed checks. The weeds occurring were predominantly dicotyledons being Portulaca oleracea L. and Chenopodium album L. the most dominant. Control evaluation was done at 48 days showing an excelent control of dicotyledons (over 95 %) by all treatments. Ioxynil alone or mixed with oxadiazon did not control grasses and <b>chloroxuron</b> showed the lowest general control but yielded satisfactory. Oxadiazon in pre-emergence and linuron in post-emergence were the most efficient in controling gresses. There were no differences among treatments for bulb yield...|$|E
40|$|The first {{stages of}} the {{photocatalytic}} degradation of the compounds chlortoluron [3 -(3 -chloro- 4 - methylphenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea] and <b>chloroxuron</b> 3 -[4 -(4 -chlorophenoxy) phenyl]- 1, 1 -dimethylurea, belonging to the class of phenyl-urea herbicides, were investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-IT-MS/MS). Degradation was accomplished under solar radiation, using TiO 2 embedded into a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) transparent matrix as a heterogeneous photocatalyst. Aliquots of the chlorinated herbicide solutions were withdrawn at different times and subjected to gradient elution, reversed-phase HPLC separations, specifically optimized to obtain the highest resolution between peaks related to the herbicide degradation by-products. The latter were then investigated using MS detection; in particular, MS/MS measurements were made and structural information {{was obtained from the}} interpretation of fragmentation data. Several by-products were identified; the most important ones are hydroxylated compounds arising from the interaction between the two chlorinated herbicides and OH radicals generated at the TiO 2 surface under irradiation. Other by-products were generated by slightly different processes, namely demethylation, dearylation and dechlorination, eventually followed by interaction with OHradicals...|$|E
40|$|The {{degradation}} pathways {{exhibited by}} three phenyl-urea herbicides: isoproturon (ISO), chlortoluron (CHLT) and <b>chloroxuron</b> (CHLOX), during photocatalytic (on supported TiO 2 under intense solar radiation) and electro-Fenton (EF) treatment were investigated by HPLC coupled to electrospray ionization single and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS and MS/MS). In particular, {{the dependence of}} degradation efficiency on the initial concentration ratio between substrate and Fe(III) ion was assessed for the EF treatment and a 1 : 1 ratio {{was found to be}} optimal. A comparison between photocatalytic and EF degradation, in terms of structures, number and evolution on a similar time scale (up to 5 h) of by-products, was then performed. Similar reactivities were found in the two cases, hydroxylation (single and multiple, with H, alkyl groups or CL substitution, depending on the herbicide) and demethylation on the dimethylamino moiety (eventually followed by hydroxylation) being the most relevant processes in by-products generation. The scale of EF degradation efficiency for the three herbicides was almost identical to the photocatalytic one (ISO > CHLT approximate to CHLOX), yet electro-Fenton proved to be a more efficient process, generally leading to a faster further degradation of by-products...|$|E
40|$|For {{successful}} strawberry production, {{weed control}} {{in the first four}} to six weeks after planting is essential to avoid reductions in vegetative growth and fruit yield from weed competition. The day-neutral strawberry has the potential as a commercial crop, but applied research into weed control is needed to determine tolerance to herbicides. Field experiments were conducted in 1984 and 1985 to evaluate the effects of herbicides (alone or in combination) on growth and development of two strawberry types, 'Hecker' (day-neutral) and 'Bounty' (June-bearer). All herbicide application rates are given as kilogram active ingredient per hectare (kgÂ·ha- 1). Trifluralin (1. 1, 2. 2 kgÂ·ha- 1); pendimethalin (1. 5, 3. 0 kgÂ·ha- 1); napropamide (4. 5 kgÂ·ha- 1) were preplant incorporated (PPI). Simazine (0. 5, 1. 0 kgÂ·ha- 1); terbacil (0. 25 / 0. 15 kgÂ·ha- 1, 0. 5 / 0. 25 kgÂ·ha- 1); metolachlor (1. 68, 2. 64 kgÂ·ha- 1), sethoxydim (0. 25, 0. 35 kgÂ·ha- 1); <b>chloroxuron</b> (5. 6 kgÂ·ha- 1) were applied four and eight weeks after planting, respectively. Two combinations included were trifluralin (PPI) / terbacil (POST) applied at 1. 1 / 0. 5 kgÂ·ha- 1 and napropamide (PPI) / sethoxydim (POST) applied at 4. 5 / 0. 25 kgÂ·ha- 1. Trifluralin applied at 2. 2 kgÂ·ha- 1, napropamide/sethoxydim (4. 5 / 0. 25 kgÂ·ha- 1), pendimethalin applied at 3. 0 kgÂ·ha- 1, <b>chloroxuron</b> applied at 5. 6 kgÂ·ha- 1; both rates of simazine, terbacil, metolachlor, and sethoxydim in 1984 reduced 'Hecker' fruit yield. No significant reductions in 'Hecker' fruit yield occurred in 1985 when compared to the untreated control. Trifluralin applied at 2. 2 kgÂ·ha- 1 caused reductions in Bounty fruit yield. No significant reductions in 'Hecker' runner growth occurred in 1984, however, reductions occurred in all treated plots in 1985. Significant reductions in 'Bounty' fruit yield resulted from plots treated with trifluralin applied at 2. 2 kgÂ·ha- 1. Significant reductions in 'Bounty' runner growth occurred in all treatment plots in 1984 except trifluralin/terbacil and terbacil (0. 25 / 0. 15 kgÂ·ha- 1) treatment plots. In 1985, significant reductions in runner growth resulted from napropamide (4. 5 kgÂ·ha- 1), napropamide/sethoxydim, and terbacil (0. 25 / 0. 15 kgÂ·ha- 1) treatments. The most effective weed control results were obtained from napropamide and pendimethalin treatments. All treatments were safe on Bounty, however Hecker had a lower level of tolerance to all herbicide treatments. Unacceptable levels of terbacil residue were detected in 'Hecker' fruit.
