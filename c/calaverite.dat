500|$|Tellurium is {{sometimes}} found in its native (i.e., elemental) form, but {{is more often}} found as the tellurides of gold such as <b>calaverite</b> and [...] krennerite (two different polymorphs of AuTe2), petzite, Ag3AuTe2, and sylvanite, AgAuTe4. The city of Telluride, Colorado was named in hope of a strike of gold telluride (which never materialized, though gold metal ore was found). Gold itself is usually found uncombined, but when found as a chemical compound, it is most often combined with tellurium.|$|E

50|$|Calaverite’s {{structure}} {{has been both}} an object of fascination and frustration {{in the scientific community}} for many years. Goldschmidt et al. indexed <b>calaverite</b> 105 crystals resulting in 92 forms but needed five different lattices to index all of the faces.

50|$|<b>Calaverite</b> {{was first}} {{recognized}} and obtained in 1861 from the Stanislaus Mine, Carson Hill, Angels Camp, in Calaveras Co., California. It {{was named for}} the County of origin by chemist and mineralogist Frederick Augustus Genth who differentiated it from the known gold telluride mineral sylvanite, and formally reported it as a new gold mineral in 1868. Genth found that the telluride formula for <b>calaverite</b> generally corresponded with the gold-silver telluride mineral sylvanite, but had a far lower percentage of ionic silver in place of ionic gold (3 to 3.5% in Genth's analysis, vs. 11 to 13% silver typical for sylvanite). Since silver is isomorphous with gold in telluride minerals (i.e. gold atoms replace silver without automatically changing the crystal character), Genth more importantly reported the <b>calaverite</b> differed from sylvanite in having no distinct crystalline cleavage line, whereas sylvanite was known to have a distinct line of cleavage. (As discussed above, both sylvanite and <b>calaverite</b> have since {{been found to be}} basically monoclinic, whereas the third known gold-silver telluride mineral krennerite is orthorhombic, with yet a different characteristic line of cleavage parallel to the crystal base). Genth was later also able to characterize a sample of <b>calaverite</b> from Boulder, Colorado, finding that his two specimens from that location were 2.04 and 3.03% silver.|$|E

50|$|Weissite {{occurs in}} {{hydrothermal}} deposits associated with pyrite, native tellurium, sylvanite, petzite, rickardite, native sulfur, native gold, <b>calaverite</b> and krennerite.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of X-ray diffraction did not completely solve this problem. Tunell and Ksanda in 1936 and then Tunell and Pauling in 1952 solved the C2/m general structure of <b>calaverite.</b> However, additional diffraction spots {{which they could}} not interpret {{were present in the}} survey. Later, transmission electron microscopy study suggested that the satellite reflections in <b>calaverite</b> were due to Au in incommensurately displacive modulation superimposed on the average C2/m structure. In 1988, Schutte and DeBoer solved the structure by using the 3H super space group C2/m (α O γ)Os. They also showed that these modulations consist mainly of the displacements of tellurium atoms and the observed modulations were interpreted in terms of valence fluctuations between the Au+ and Au3+. According to Schutte and DeBoer, those displacements also affect the coordination number of <b>calaverite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ores {{in which}} gold occurs in {{chemical}} composition with other elements are comparatively rare. They include <b>calaverite,</b> sylvanite, nagyagite, petzite and krennerite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Calaverite</b> {{occurs as}} monoclinic crystals, {{which do not}} possess {{cleavage}} planes. It has a specific gravity of 9.35 and a hardness of 2.5.|$|E

50|$|<b>Calaverite</b> can be {{dissolved}} in concentrated sulfuric acid. In hot sulfuric acid the mineral dissolves, leaving a spongy mass {{of gold in}} a red solution of tellurium.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs with}} other tellurides in vein gold deposits. It is {{commonly}} associated with native gold, hessite, sylvanite, krennerite, <b>calaverite,</b> altaite, montbrayite, melonite,frohbergite, tetradymite, rickardite, vulcanite and pyrite.|$|E
50|$|The mineral {{often has}} a {{metallic}} luster, and its color may {{range from a}} silvery white to a brassy yellow. It {{is closely related to}} the gold-silver telluride mineral sylvanite, which, however, contains significantly more silver. Another AuTe2 mineral (but with a quite different crystal structure) is krennerite. <b>Calaverite</b> and sylvanite represent the major telluride ores of gold, although such ores are minor sources of gold in general. As a major gold mineral found in Western Australia, <b>calaverite</b> {{played a major role in}} the 1890s gold rushes in that area.|$|E
50|$|<b>Calaverite</b> occurrences include Cripple Creek, Colorado, Calaveras County, California, US (from {{where it}} gets its name), Nagyag, Romania, Kirkland Lake Gold District, Ontario, Rouyn District, Quebec, and Kalgoorlie, Australia.|$|E
5000|$|Calaveras (Karaberasu) is {{the second}} oldest of the sisters and is a {{counterpart}} of Sailor Venus. She is named for the mineral <b>calaverite</b> and her attack is [...] "Dark beauty".|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs in}} gold-tellurium epithermal {{hydrothermal}} veins. Minerals associated with nagyágite include: altaite, petzite, stutzite, sylvanite, tellurantimony, coloradoite, krennerite,native arsenic, native gold, proustite, rhodochrosite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, tetrahedrite, <b>calaverite,</b> tellurobismuthite, galena and pyrite.|$|E
5000|$|Natural gold {{telluride}}s, like <b>calaverite</b> and krennerite (AuTe2), petzite ( [...] Ag3AuTe2), and sylvanite (AgAuTe4), are minor ores of gold (and tellurium). See telluride minerals {{for more}} information on individual naturally occurring tellurides.|$|E
50|$|Genth {{was first}} to {{describe}} and characterize {{a number of new}} minerals, often ores of tellurium. Among those still recognized today are: melonite, <b>calaverite,</b> cosalite, schirmerite, coloradoite, montanite, kerrite, maconite, willcoxite, dudleyite, endlichite, landsfordite, nesquehonite, phosphuranylite, and penfieldite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Calaverite,</b> or gold telluride, is an {{uncommon}} telluride of gold, a metallic mineral with the chemical formula AuTe2, with approximately 3% {{of the gold}} replaced by silver. It was first discovered in Calaveras County, California in 1861, and was named for the county in 1868.|$|E
50|$|Krennerite is an {{orthorhombic}} {{gold telluride}} mineral which can contain variable amounts of {{silver in the}} structure. The formula is AuTe2 varying to (Au0.8,Ag0.2)Te2. Both of the chemically similar gold-silver tellurides, <b>calaverite</b> and sylvanite, are in the monoclinic crystal system, whereas krennerite is orthorhombic.|$|E
50|$|Zemannite is a {{secondary}} mineral produced by weathering of native tellurium minerals, such as sylvanite or <b>calaverite.</b> As {{a result of}} this process, the elemental tellurium or tellurium-anions (Te2− or Te22−) transform into the Te4+ cation bound with oxygen into the tellurate ion TeO32−.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, Bindi et al. {{concluded}} that the different coordination numbers associated with <b>calaverite</b> were indeed associated with a significant differentiation in the valence sum of Au, and that the random distribution of Ag suppresses the fluctuation of Au+ and Au3+, whereas the ordered distribution reinforces it.|$|E

50|$|Gold {{sometimes}} occurs {{combined with}} tellurium as the minerals <b>calaverite,</b> krennerite, nagyagite, petzite and sylvanite (see telluride minerals), {{and as the}} rare bismuthide maldonite (Au2Bi) and antimonide aurostibite (AuSb2).

50|$|In the Kalgoorlie (Australia) {{gold rush}} of the 1890s, large amounts of the little-known mineral <b>calaverite</b> (gold telluride) were {{ironically}} identified as fool's gold. These mineral deposits were used as a cheap building material, and for the filling of potholes and ruts. When several years later the mineral was identified, there was a minor gold rush to excavate the streets.|$|E
50|$|In {{the initial}} {{phase of the}} Kalgoorlie gold rush in Western Australia in 1893, large amounts of <b>calaverite</b> were {{initially}} mistaken for fool's gold, and were discarded.

50|$|There {{are only}} 5 {{parts per billion}} of {{tellurium}} in the earth's crust and 15 parts per billion of tellurium in seawater. Tellurium {{is one of the}} eight or nine least abundant elements in the earth's crust.
