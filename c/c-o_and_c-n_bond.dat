The construction of the C-O and C–N bonds is of significance as it opens avenues for the introduction of ether and amine linkages in organic molecules. Despite significant advancements in this field, the construction of C-O and C–N bonds is still a major challenge for organic chemists, due to the involvement of harsh reaction conditions {{or the use of}} expensive catalysts or ligands in many cases. Thus, it is a challenge to develop alternative, milder, cheaper and more reproducible methodologies for the construction of these types of bonds.

40|$|Iron-catalyzed {{reactions}} are receiving {{a surge of}} interest owing to the natural abundance and biocompatibility of Fe and the urge to develop practically useful sustainable catalysis for fine chemical industries. This article is a brief account of our studies on the <b>C-O</b> <b>and</b> <b>C-N</b> <b>bond</b> formation reactions catalyzed by Fe complexes supported by oligopyridine, macrocyclic tetraaza, and fluorinated porphyrin ligands. The working principle is the in situ generation of reactive Fe=O and Fe=NR intermediates supported by these oxidatively robust N-donor ligands for oxygen atom/nitrogen group transfer and insertion reactions. The catalytic reactions include C-H bond oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons (up to 87 % yield), epoxidation of alkenes (up to 96 % yield), cis-dihydroxylation of alkenes (up to 99 % yield), epoxidation-isomerization (E-I) reaction of aryl alkenes (up to 94 % yield), amination of C-H bonds (up to 95 % yield), aziridination of alkenes (up to 95 % yield), sulfimidation of sulfides (up to 96 % yield), and amide formation from aldehydes (up to 89 % yield).

40|$|A {{series of}} novel {{bimetallic}} Rh(I) complexes were prepared, containing bidentate imidazolyl-imine ligand motifs attached to rigid scaffolds including phenylene or anthracene, or flexible scaffolds including cyclohexane, ethylene or hexane. The {{three dimensional structure}} and conformational flexibility of the dirhodium complexes containing diimine ligands with a phenylene scaffold were investigated using X-Ray crystallography and DFT calculations. These dirhodium complexes were tested as catalysts for C-X (where X= O, N, Si, or B) and N-Si bond formation reactions, and their catalytic activities were compared {{to those of the}} monometallic analogue. Cooperative enhancements in reaction efficiencies or selectivities were observed on using the bimetallic complexes as catalysts for C-O and C-Si bond formation reactions compared to those using the monometallic analogue. Kinetic studies of the <b>C-O</b> <b>and</b> <b>C-N</b> <b>bond</b> formation reactions catalysed by mono- and bi-metallic Rh(I) complexes were also conducted. Empirical rate laws and activation parameters for these Rh(I) catalysed dihydroalkoxylation and hydroamination reactions were determined. Computational modelling of the mechanistic pathways using DFT indicated that the dihydroalkoxylation reaction catalysed by the dirhodium complex, containing the ortho-substituted phenylene scaffold, accessed significantly more efficient mechanistic pathways than those of the monometallic catalysed reaction. The computational modelling of the mechanism for the bimetallic catalysed dihydroalkoxylation reaction of oct- 4 -yn- 1, 8 -diol demonstrated that the proximal second rhodium centre promoted cooperative interactions via either direct Rh-Rh interactions, or carbonyl or hydrido bridging between the two rhodium centres...|$|E

Significant advancement {{has been made}} to demonstrate the key role of aldehydes in synthetic chemistry through diverse organic transformation reactions including C-C, <b>C-O,</b> <b>and</b> <b>C-N</b> <b>bond</b> formations. In this work, we would like to expand the impact of aldehyde chemistry to the interdisciplinary research areas on chemical biology and food safety. Selective modification of peptides and proteins has attracted great attention in chemical biology, as it allows the generation of novel bioconjugates used in the study of complex biological systems. The N-terminal α-amino group of peptides/proteins is utilized for site-specific modification as most proteins have only one N-terminus. In my work, site-specific N-terminal α-amino group modification of peptides by an oxime formation/exchange sequence was developed. We found that oxone (2 KHSO₅. KHSO₄. K₂SO₄) is a convenient and chemoselective reagent for oxidation of N-terminal α-amino group to oximes. The substrate scope of the present oxime formation reaction was studied by using a series of unprotected peptides XSKFR (X = 20 natural amino acids). The N-terminal modifications were found in the peptides in a range of conversions (21 - 99 %) as confirmed by ESI-MS/MS analyses. With the above promising results, subsequent functionalization of the oxime-modified peptides via an oxime exchange with O-substituted hydroxylamines was studied. Moreover, incorporation of biophysical probes such as fluorescent dansyl and PEG-linked hydroxylamine by the oxime exchange reaction was performed, leading to the corresponding functionalized peptides in 99 % conversion. These findings indicated that N-terminal α-amino group modification by using an oxime formation/exchange reaction sequence could be performed under mild reaction conditions and the present method demonstrates the potential of oxone towards peptide/protein modification. Formaldehyde is known to be a natural metabolite in various living organisms, and is thus present in many fresh and preserved foods as a normal component. Formaldehyde is not permitted for food use in Hong Kong and China. However, formaldehyde was recently found to be deliberately used in food processing in China for bleaching, protein coagulation and preservation purposes, causing a serious hazard to public health. In my work, a gold(III) complex-catalyzed three component coupling reaction of formaldehyde, an amine and an alkyne for propargylamine synthesis was established to allow formaldehyde detection within 1 hour at 50 ℃. The high selectivity of the coupling reaction to detect formaldehyde is achieved by the steric bulkiness around the amino group of the amine, as formaldehyde is the smallest aldehyde in nature. Different parameters such as catalysts, reagent ratios and solvents were optimized using a HPLC-based assay, with up to 56 % yield achieved in 1 hour. Different fluorophores such as coumarin and dansyl were employed for fluorescent detection. The reaction system could also be immobilized on solid supports such as 2 -chlorotrityl chloride resin for washing of excess reagents. Measurement of fluorescent intensity on the resin showed excellent linearity (R² = 0. 99). The reaction was applicable to detect formaldehyde in dried shiitake mushroom samples.

Hydroboration {{has the potential to}} create new C–C, <b>C–O,</b> <b>and</b> <b>C–N</b> <b>bonds</b> from an intermediate C–B bond with retention of stereochemistry. Desymmetrization resulting in the loss of one or more symmetry elements can give rise to molecular chirality, i. e., the conversion of a prochiral molecule to one that is chiral.

30|$|This has stimulated great {{interest}} {{in the application of}} catalysts to the ISC process in order to accelerate reaction and promote upgrading of reservoir crude oils. Catalysts have the ability to restructure the strongly associating structures as well as rearrange oxygen-containing groups that will effectively reduce the oil viscosity. It is also accepted that the addition of catalysts may promote the breaking of C–S, <b>C–O,</b> <b>and</b> <b>C–N</b> <b>bonds,</b> <b>and</b> hence the chemical properties of heavy oil are changed in favor of liquid flow. Rezaei et al. (2013) and Murillo-Hernández et al. (2009) studied the thermocatalytic influence of nanoparticles and ionic liquids on the oxidation reaction. Lower activation energies were observed for various reactions involved in the combustion process. Kök and Bagci (2004) investigated catalytic effects of metallic salts on the combustion properties of crude oil by reaction kinetic cell experiments. The reaction had been positively catalyzed and the molar ratio of CO 2 /CO of effluent gases increased by additives. Wang et al. (2012) conducted a comparative study of the catalytic effect of tungsten oxide supported on zirconia via different methods to reduce the viscosity of heavy crude oil. With the heavy components converted into light ones and the removal of heteroatoms, the powdered catalyst prepared by the hydrothermal method reduced the viscosity of oil from 5740 to 1020  mPa s, a reduction of 82  %. Upgrading and viscosity reduction of heavy oil by a catalytic ionic liquid and its modified version were investigated by Shaban et al. (2014). With the asphaltenes dissolved by ionic liquids, the oil viscosity reduction increased from 26.8  % to 78.6  % and the sulfur reduction increased to 20  % when the reaction was performed with the modified catalyst at 90  °C. Moore et al. (1999) conducted a combustion tube experiment {{in the presence of a}} nickel/alumina catalyst, an 8 -point gravity increase was detected for the test Middle East crude of 18 ° API gravity in addition to a 50  % sulfur removal in the produced oil. Pu et al. (2015) used oxidation tube experiments to study the low-temperature oxidation and characteristics of heavy oil under reaction conditions of 120  °C, 72  h, and 30  MPa. With the addition of the oil-soluble catalyst, cobalt naphthenate to promote the crude oil oxidation, the viscosity of the oxidized oil decreased dramatically. Abuhesa and Hughes (2009) compared the conventional and catalytic ISC process for oil recovery using a low-pressure combustion cell. They found that the presence of a catalyst advanced the combustion reactions and the resultant oil was upgraded by up to 11 points due to several processes such as pyrolysis, distillation, and cracking, which were governed by temperature. Weissman et al. (1996) applied a combustion tube apparatus to down-hole catalytic upgrading of heavy crude oil in the presence and absence of alumina-supported nickel molybdenum, catalytic upgrading was due to hydrogenation and the API of oxidized oil increased from 15.3 to 23.2 with about a 50  % sulfur removal.|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} century, the [3, 3]-sigmatropic {{rearrangement}} {{has been a}} valuable and evolving transformation, providing a direct, effective process {{for the formation of}} new C–C, <b>C–O</b> <b>and</b> <b>C–N</b> <b>bonds.</b> The studies discussed in this thesis continue this rich history, describing a number of ways in which this rearrangement has been applied to the synthesis of various useful molecules, such as α hydroxy amides, spiro orthoamides and pyrimidinediones. To accomplish this, four variants of the reaction have been employed: Chapters 1 and 2 explore the 3 aza 4, 6 dioxa [3, 3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, while chapters 3 and 4 discuss work based upon the 3 aza 4 oxa-, 3, 4 diaza- and 3, 4 -dithia-[3, 3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. In Chapter 1, work on a 3 aza 4, 6 dioxa [3, 3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of hydroxamic acid derivatives is described. In such a reaction, a new C–O bond is forged upon rearrangement as opposed to the traditional C–C bond, and is therefore classified as a hetero [3, 3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. Limited precedents exist for such a transformation, and the presented method improves on the available protocols by both widening the scope of the reaction to include substrates that were previously inaccessible, and in the ease in which the transformation occurs. It was also found that the amount of reagent used influenced the outcome of the reaction: a stoichiometric amount of reagent with respect to substrate favored the formation of α acyloxyamides, while an excess of reagents favored cyclic orthoamides. This represents a new method for the synthesis of these cyclic compounds. Lastly, attempts were made to control the diastereoselectivity of the rearrangement, making use of amino acids as chiral auxiliaries in the reaction. The studies described in Chapter 2 apply the rearrangement developed in Chapter 1 towards the synthesis of novel spirocyclic molecules. Occurring through a unique hetero-[3, 3] sigmatropic rearrangement – spirocyclization cascade, attempts to develop a reproducible method and insights into the possible mechanism are discussed. Chapter 3 introduces a new method for the preparation of derivatized pyrimidine nucleobases based on either a 3 aza 4 oxa- or a 3, 4 diaza-[3, 3]-sigmatropic rearrangement – Curtius rearrangement – dehydrogenation cascade. The N,N’-diacylhydrazine or N,O-diacylhydroxylamine starting materials can be easily prepared, the major steps are both simple and tolerant {{of a wide range of}} substituents, and the sequence allows for regiocontrol of the substituent placement on the pyrimidine ring, making for an attractive method into pyrimidine nucleobase analogs. An application was envisioned in which these molecules could be used as fluorescent probes; as such, the first in a new class of pro-fluorescent nucleobases has been efficiently prepared using this method, with in vitro and in vivo efficacy soon be tested. Chapter 4 evaluates the coupling reaction of thioenolates. There is only one literature precedent that describes such a transformation and its mechanism is unconfirmed, however, it was proposed to occur either through a 3, 4 -dithia-[3, 3]-sigmatropic rearrangement or an oxidative enolate coupling. The preceding chapters of this thesis demonstrate the power of the [3, 3]-sigmatropic rearrangement in the formation of new bonds between enolates; this last chapter evaluates an alternative approach: the oxidative enolate coupling reaction. The oxidative enolate coupling of thioamides and thioesters was achieved in poor to good yields, with reaction success being highly substrate specific. During the course of synthesizing the starting materials required for the reaction, a novel method for the thionation of amides and esters was developed.

This critical review focuses on metalloporphyrin-catalysed saturated C-H bond functionalisation reported since the year 2000, including <b>C-O,</b> <b>C-N</b> <b>and</b> C-C <b>bond</b> formation via hydroxylation, amination and carbenoid insertion, respectively, together with {{a brief description of}} previous achievements in this area. Among the metalloporphyrin-catalysed reactions highlighted herein are the hydroxylation of steroids, cycloalkanes and benzylic hydrocarbons; intermolecular amination of steroids, cycloalkanes and benzylic or allylic hydrocarbons; intramolecular amination of sulfamate esters and organic azides; intermolecular carbenoid insertion into benzylic, allylic or alkane C-H bonds; and intramolecular carbenoid C-H insertion of tosylhydrazones. These metalloporphyrin-catalysed saturated C-H bond functionalisation reactions feature high regio-, diastereo- or enantioselectivity and/or high product turnover numbers. Mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of metal-oxo, -imido (or nitrene), and -carbene porphyrin complexes in the reactions. The reactivity of such metal-ligand multiple bonded species towards saturated C-H bonds, including mechanistic studies through both experimental and theoretical means, is also discussed (244 references). © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

In patients with ichthyoses or atopic dermatitis, {{the composition of the}} skin barrier lipids is disturbed resulting in dry, scaly, itching erythematous skin. Using the latest X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) technology, we investigated the physiological skin lipid composition of human skin and the effects of cold atmospheric plasma treatment on the lipid composition. Skin lipids were stripped off forearms of six healthy volunteers using the cyanoacrylate glue technique, plasma treated or not and then subjected to detailed XPS analysis. We found that the human lipid skin barrier consisted of 84. 4 % carbon (+ 1. 3 SEM%), 10. 8 % oxygen (+ 1. 0 SEM%) and 4. 8 % nitrogen (+ 0. 3 SEM%). The composition of physiological skin lipids was not different in males and females. Plasma treatment resulted in significant changes in skin barrier lipid stoichiometry. The total carbon amount was reduced to 76. 7 %, and the oxygen amount increased to 16. 5 %. There was also a slight increase in nitrogen to 6. 8 %. These changes could be attributed to reduced C-C <b>bonds</b> <b>and</b> increased <b>C-O,</b> C=O, <b>C-N</b> <b>and</b> N-C-O <b>bonds.</b> The moderate increase in nitrogen was caused by an increase in <b>C-N</b> <b>and</b> N-C-O <b>bonds.</b> Our results show {{for the first time that}} plasma treatment leads to considerable changes in the human skin lipid barrier.

In general, gold complexes have not been exploited as reagents in organometallic or inorganic chemistry, although a few gold(l) aryl and alkynyl compounds have been reported to undergo transmetalation with transition metal complexes. We have been developing methods for functionalizing uranium complexes and have shown that Cu(l) -X reagents effect the oxidation of uranium with formation of U-X bonds, providing easy chemical control over uranium in oxidation states ranging from U{sup III}{yields}U{sup VI}. Although a logical approach for the direct generation of U-carbon and U-azide bonds, this Cu-based platform is limited in scope as it only works for pure and isolable copper compounds. This is problematic given the instability of organocuprates and copper azides, which can detonate violently as isolated solids. As such, this route has been confined to the synthesis of select uranium phenylacetylide complexes. Over the past few years, a variety of stable gold(l) alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkynyl, and azide complexes have been reported, propelling us to investigate their potential as reagents within the oxidative functionalization platform. Unlike the related CU{sup I} systems, Au{sup I} reagents are easily derivatized, and are safe to handle and isolate. Herein, we report that gold(l) -phosphine compounds can undergo a new class of reaction, and are excellent reagents for the oxidative functionalization of uranium with azide and carbon anions...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Terpenes are a {{large family}} of natural {{compounds}} derived from linked isoprene subunits. Steroids, flavorings, fragrances, {{and a large number}} of pharmaceuticals are either terpenes or have a terpene component. The research presented in this thesis arose from approaches to terpenoids containing seven-membered rings We attempted to directly synthesize seven-membered rings via a [5 + 2] cycloaddition between pentadienyl ketones and alkenes to provide cycloheptanones. This conceptual cycloaddition shared symmetry elements with the [3 + 2] dipolar cycloaddition and the [4 + 2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Two substrate classes expected to participate in [5 + 2] cycloadditions were synthesized. Unfortunately, the anticipated cycloaddition did not occur under several screened Lewis-Acidic conditions. The natural products psiguadial A and premnalatifolin A inspired us to exploit ortho-quinone methides (o-QMs) to generate their central heptacycles. o-QMs are extremely reactive intermediates that are often difficult to control, and there are few examples of the addition of highly basic enolates to o-QMs. We reasoned that an enolate and an o-QM could both be generated by treatment of a mixture of a silyl enol ether or silyl ketene acetal and an O-silylated phenoxy benzyl halide with anhydrous fluoride, resulting in the simultaneous generation and coupling of an enolate nucleophile and electrophilic o-QM. The reactive nature of the o-QMs facilitated the formation of sterically congested carbon–carbon bonds that are otherwise difficult to generate using conventional enolate alkylation. Our protocol generates ketone or ester enolates and o-QMs in situ in a single flask, which join to give a variety of -(2 -hydroxyphenyl) -carbonyl compounds in a single step. The resulting functionalized phenols are common building blocks in natural product synthesis. This method provides the foundation for construction of psiguadial A and premnalatifolin A. During our attempts to harness aza-ortho-xylylenes in a system analogous to o-QMs, we encountered and developed a system for the functionalization of anilines. Aniline and aminophenol structures constitute a useful family of synthetic building blocks, ligands and catalyst frameworks, and are a part of many biologically-active compounds and natural products. Despite the importance of these substructures, methods that allow direct access to these classes of compounds are rare. We developed an efficient process to generate functionalized anilines utilizing metal-free conditions and easily accessable reagents. Our process displays some generality in both aniline and acitvating agent. These <b>C–O,</b> C–C, <b>and</b> <b>C–N</b> <b>bond</b> formations are facilitated by an increase in oxidation level from aniline to aniline-N-oxide, conveniently generated by treating the corresponding anilines with mCPBA. Following an O-acylation event, group transfer from nitrogen to carbon excises the weak N–O bond and gives an iminium ion, and after loss of a proton, aromaticity and electron density at nitrogen are restored. These bond formations proceed in seconds to minutes at low temperature, in an effecient and convieneient manner. As part of our broader research program with N,N-dialkylaniline-N-oxides, we exploited an observed Polonovski-type reactivity by capturing a putative iminium ion prior to carbon atom loss. N,N-dimethylanilines containing an ortho-nucleophilic function, installed previously using our aniline functionalization, are transformed into N-methylindolines via the corresponding N,N-dimethylaniline-N-oxides. The first terpenoid target, psiguadial A, features three fused rings in a 7 - 5 - 7 arrangement, with both seven member rings heavily substituted. This compound possesses remarkable cytotoxicity, inhibiting the growth of HepG 2 cells (IC 50 = 61. 07 ± 1. 77 nM). We envisioned joining a complex enol ether to an o-QM utilizing our coupling conditions, followed by an oxa-Michael ring-closing. We have accomplished this assembly with a model system, and are now targeting the natural product. The second terpenoid, premnalatifolin A, displays considerable activity against the MCF- 7 line of human breast cancer cells, with an (IC 50 = 1. 77 μM) compared to the activity of doxorubicin (IC 50 = 3. 67 μM). The potent activity and novel dimeric structure attracted our interest. To construct each monomer utilizing our o-QM method, we envisioned a simple retrosynthesis that disconnects the cycloheptene central ring into two halves of comparable complexity. We imagined a metathesis event sealing the cycloheptene after initial alkylation of the o-QM, where our diastereoselectivity is derived from alkylation by the less hindered face of the enolate. Initial studies of the o-QM enolate coupling to prepare models of the icetexane core are underway...|$|R
