25|$|In organic chemistry, Carnelley's Rule, {{established}} in 1882 by Thomas Carnelley, states that high molecular symmetry {{is associated with}} high melting point. Carnelley based his rule on examination of 15,000 chemical compounds. For example, for three structural isomers with molecular formula C5H12 the melting point increases in the series isopentane −160°C (113 K) n-pentane −129.8°C (143 K) and neopentane −16.4°C (256.8 K). Likewise in xylenes and also dichlorobenzenes the melting point increases in the order meta, ortho and then para. Pyridine has a lower symmetry than benzene hence its lower melting point but the melting point again increases with diazine and triazines. Many cage-like compounds like adamantane and <b>cubane</b> with high symmetry have relatively high melting points.|$|E

The {{modulation}} of {{the magnetic}} properties of SMMs and their organization in extended magnetic arrays are, at the present, {{some of the top}} areas in the field of molecular magnetism for the implication in the improvement of the physical properties of the SMM and the potential use in devices such as for data storage. Few polymers of SMM have been structurally characterized in spite of the number of known SMM. [Co 4 citrate 4] 8 - <b>cubanes</b> can behave as SMM. We have reported recently the union of these <b>cubanes</b> through “Co(H 2 O) 2 ETG” (ETG=ethylene glycol) bridges and the formation of anionic 2 D layers. These layers crystallize in the tetragonal system, P- 421 c space group, with counterions (Cs+ or Rb+), water and ETG molecules connecting the layers though electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bridges. The magnetic studies show the co-existence of two magnetic nets: the SMM net and the one formed by the bridged cobalt atoms and also shows the influence of the counterions in the layer magnetic properties. Two intriguing relaxation processes with different characteristics timescales are observed. Moreover, [Co 4 citrate 4] 8 - <b>cubanes</b> can also organize in 3 D, diamond-like structural arrays showing SMM magnetic behaviour below 6 K with an enegry barrier of 54 K and magnetic ordering below 2. 7 K.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the well-known reaction of phosphonic acids RP(O) (OH) (2) with divalent transition-metal ions that yields layered metal phosphonates [RPO(3) M(H(2) O) ](n), the 2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl ester of phosphoric acid, dippH(2), reacts with zinc acetate in methanol under ambient conditions to afford tetrameric zinc phosphate [(ArO) PO(3) Zn(MeOH) ](4) (1). The coordinated methanol in 1 can be readily exchanged by stronger Lewis basic ligands at room temperature. This strategy opens up {{a new avenue for}} building double-four-ring (D 4 R) cubane-based supramolecular assemblies through strong intercubane hydrogen-bonding interactions. Seventeen pyridinic ligands have been used to synthesize as many D 4 R <b>cubanes</b> [(ArO) PO(3) Zn(L) ](4) (2 - 18) from 1. The ligands have been chosen {{in such a way that}} the majority of them contain an additional functional group that could be used for noncovalent synthesis of extended structures. When the ligand does not contain any other hydrogen-bonding donor-acceptor sites (e. g., 2, 4, 6 -trimethylpyridine (collidine)), zero-dimensional D 4 R <b>cubanes</b> have been obtained. The use of pyridine, lutidine, 2 -aminopyridine, and 2, 6 -diaminopyridine, however, results in the formation of linear or zigzag one-dimensional assemblies of D 4 R <b>cubanes</b> through strong intermolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot O or N-H center dot center dot center dot O interactions. Construction of two-dimensional assemblies of zinc phosphates has been achieved by employing 2 -hydroxypyridine or 2 -methylimidazole as the exo-cubane ligand on zinc centers. The introduction of an alcohol side chain on the pyridinic ligand in such a way that the -CH(2) OH group cannot participate in intracubane hydrogen bonding (e. g., pyridine- 3 -methanol, pyridine- 4 -methanol, and 3, 5 -dimethylpyrazole-N-ethanol) leads to the facile noncovalent synthesis of three-dimensional framework structures. Apart from being useful as building blocks for noncovalent synthesis of zeolite-like materials, compounds 1 - 18 can also be thermolyzed at approximately 500 degrees C to yield high-purity zinc pyrophosphate (Zn(2) P(2) O(7)) ceramic material...|$|R

Most of the results were obtained with a simple iron dimer model, but a few calculations were also done for larger models, the largest one containing eight iron atoms. The model clusters were in general chosen to have a net neutral ionic charge with the iron atoms in the low Fe(II) oxidation state with ferromagnetically coupled spins. In a key result we find that placing a hydrogen atom on a bridging sulfur dramatically changes the affinity of the cluster for N 2. In the dimer model without this hydrogen atom, N 2 forms only a weak end-on bond {{to one of the}} iron atoms, but with the hydrogen atom present N 2 becomes strongly activated in a bridging coordination. The effect of the hydrogen atom can be described as a local promotion effect reducing the Fe 2 (II,II) system to an Fe 2 (I,II) set. A very similar promotion effect is seen also for the larger clusters. Another interesting effect noted for the Fe 8 cluster is that a cavity between the <b>cubanes</b> in the cluster can be opened by reducing the cluster with two hydrogen atoms on bridging sulfurs. Coupled electron and proton transfer and energetic aspects are emphasized.
