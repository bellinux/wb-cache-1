We explore {{the availability of}} high-temporal resolution expression data using the Living Cell Array and we formulate to critical problems.

40|$|Color poster with text, map and imagesCrystal darter (Ammocrypta asprella) is {{currently}} listed as {{an endangered species}} in Wisconsin. They have long and slender body with large pectoral fins and a moderately long head and snout. This species thrive in turbid and strong current water with sandy riffles, bars, and pools. Little is known about A. asprella and documented occurrences are rare in Wisconsin. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop an effective methodology for capturing this species where it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>quantify</b> and observed. Although previous method have shown capturing success rate with the Missouri Trawl, we will be testing other methods such as seines and electric shocker on various locations along the Red Cedar River where A. asprella were sighted. Statistical analyses will report which methodologies is significant. This research will provide valuable information for Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources so that conservation practices of A. asprella can be implemented.
