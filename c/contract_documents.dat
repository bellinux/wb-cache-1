25|$|Stage I {{commenced}} on 2 March 1959 {{with the}} construction firm Civil & Civic, monitored by the engineers Ove Arup and Partners. The government had pushed for work to begin early, fearing that funding, or public opinion, might turn against them. However, Utzon had still not completed the final designs. Major structural issues still remained unresolved. By 23 January 1961, work was running 47 weeks behind, mainly because of unexpected difficulties (inclement weather, unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater, construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared, changes of original <b>contract</b> <b>documents).</b> Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963. The forced early start led to significant later problems, not {{least of which was}} the fact that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure, and had to be re-built.|$|E
40|$|With {{the growth}} {{experienced}} in the Building Industry, it is increasingly {{important to have a}} <b>contract</b> <b>document</b> that can be used on projects that is reasonably acceptable to all parties concerned. The objective of the research was to determine the effectiveness of the Joint Building Contracts Committee Series 2000 Principal Building Agreement (JBCC 2000 PBA) (Edition 4. 1, March 2005) currently used in the Building Industry. The literature reviewed and results of quantitative research amongst contractors formed the basis of this study. The study revealed that the JBCC 2000 PBA is the most favourable <b>contract</b> <b>document</b> used by contractors in the Building Industry. With the inclusion of a range of construction guarantee alternatives in the <b>contract</b> <b>document</b> in lieu of the retention clause, {{more than half of the}} respondents have indicated that they are in favour of a retention clause to be included in the <b>contract</b> <b>document</b> as an alternative security option. The study also showed that there are still areas of concern with regards to the difficulty in interpreting and implementing numerous clauses of the document and that amendments were made to the document without legal advice, resulting in disputes. The research further also revealed that developing building contractors experience difficulties in general where the JBCC 2000 PBA is used as <b>contract</b> <b>document</b> on projects. There also seems to be no balance of risk between the employer and contractor in most cases where this <b>contract</b> <b>document</b> is used. The research concluded with proposals on revisions to some clauses to ensure a better <b>contract</b> <b>document</b> that will be acceptable to all contractors in the Building Industry and ultimately to be an internationally acceptable documen...|$|R

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of any {{construction}} project, the work scope may change. Change is a normal and expected part of the construction process. Changes can {{be the result of}} necessary design modifications, differing site conditions, material availability, contractor-requested changes, value engineering and impacts from third parties, to name a few. Beyond executing the change in the field, the change normally needs to be documented to show what was actually constructed. This is referred to as change management. Hence, the owner usually requires a final record to show all changes or, more specifically, any change that modifies the tangible portions of the finished work. The record is made on the <b>contract</b> <b>documents</b> – usually, but not necessarily limited to, the design drawings. The end product of this effort is what the industry terms as-built drawings, or more simply, [...] "as built." [...] The requirement for providing them is a norm in construction contracts. Construction document management is a highly important task undertaken with the aid an online or desktop software system, or maintained through physical documentation. The increasing legality pertaining to the construction industries maintenance of correct documentation has caused the increase in the need for document management systems.|$|E

The <b>contract</b> <b>document</b> usually is from the (Request for Proposal) that submitted by the tenderer that then be evaluated by the tender committee. If the entire requirement is fulfilled, the Request for Proposal is usually converted to the Agreement of <b>Contract</b> or <b>Contract</b> <b>Document</b> or called Condition of Contract. The Condition of Contract may be altered by the client to suit the price tendered by contractor. There will be some terms added by the client to make the Condition of Contract clearer and understandable. One of the terms is mutual termination agreement. Most of time, the mutual termination clause is like a silent in a Condition of Contract. Nobody bother about it. There are no mutual termination clause in PWD 203 A (2010), PAM (2006), CIDB (2000) etc. Surat Pekeliling Perbendaharaan (SPP) Bil. 3 Tahun 2008 Pelaksanaan Syarat Perubahan Harga Di Dalam Kontrak Kerja was issue that suits the situation for increment in price for that year.
