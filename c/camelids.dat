5|$|The {{dromedary}} has 74 diploid chromosomes, {{the same}} as other <b>camelids.</b> The autosomes consist of five pairs of small to medium-sized metacentrics and submetacentrics. The X chromosome is {{the largest in the}} metacentric and submetacentric group. There are 31 pairs of acrocentrics. The dromedary's karyotype {{is similar to that of}} the Bactrian camel.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} Bactrian camel, the {{dromedary}} has a lighter build, longer limbs, shorter hairs, a harder palate and an insignificant or absent ethmoidal fissure. Unlike the <b>camelids</b> {{of the genus}} Lama, the dromedary has a hump, and in comparison has a longer tail, smaller ears, squarer feet and a greater height at the shoulder. The dromedary has four teats instead of the two in the Lama species.|$|E
5|$|S. {{gracilis}} entered South America {{during the}} early to middle Pleistocene, where it probably gave rise to S.populator, which lived {{in the eastern part}} of the continent. S.fatalis also entered western South America in the late Pleistocene, and the two species were therefore divided by the Andes mountains. The American interchange resulted in a mix of native and invasive species sharing the prairies and woodlands in South America; North American herbivores included proboscideans, horses, <b>camelids</b> and deer, South American herbivores included toxodonts, litopterns, ground sloths, and glyptodonts. Native metatherian predators (including the saber-toothed thylacosmilids) had gone extinct by the Pliocene, and were replaced by North American carnivores such as canids, bears, and large cats.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no single}} universally agreed {{definition}} of which species are livestock. Widely agreed types of livestock include cattle for beef and dairy, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry. Various other species are sometimes considered livestock, such as horses, while poultry birds are sometimes excluded. In {{some parts of the}} world, livestock includes species such as buffalo, and the South American <b>camelids,</b> the alpaca and llama. Some authorities use much broader definitions to include fish in aquaculture, micro-livestock such as rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as insects from honey bees to crickets raised for human consumption.|$|E
25|$|The camelid lineage {{has a good}} fossil record. Camel-like {{animals have}} been traced from the {{thoroughly}} differentiated, modern species back through early Miocene forms. Their characteristics became more general, and they lost those that distinguished them as camelids; hence, they were classified as ancestral artiodactyls. No fossils of these earlier forms {{have been found in}} the Old World, indicating that North America was the original home of <b>camelids,</b> and that Old World camels crossed over via the Bering Land Bridge. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama three million years ago allowed <b>camelids</b> to spread to South America as part of the Great American Interchange, where they evolved further. Meanwhile, North American <b>camelids</b> died {{out at the end of}} the Pleistocene.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the rock}} art in Choquequirao is in the terraced area where {{cultivation}} occurred. Archaeologists have documented twenty-five semi-naturalistic figures on the terraces of sector VIII of Choquequirao. The rocks used to build the walls are dark schist while the <b>camelid</b> images are of white calcocuarcita, a sandstone of quartz and carbonate. The <b>camelid</b> motifs vary between a maximum height of 1.94 m and one minimum of 1.25 m. In 2004, archaeologist Zenobio Valencia from the University of San Antonio Abad of Cusco found several <b>camelid</b> figurines made of white stones {{in a group of}} terraces in one sector of the archaeological site.|$|R
25|$|The karyotypes of {{different}} camelid {{species have been}} studied earlier by many groups, but no agreement on chromosome nomenclature of <b>camelids</b> has been reached. A 2007 study flow sorted camel chromosomes, building {{on the fact that}} camels have 37 pairs of chromosomes (2n=74), and found that the karyotime consisted of one metacentric, three submetacentric, and 32 acrocentric autosomes. The Y is a small metacentric chromosome, while the X is a large metacentric chromosome.|$|E
25|$|In the Sierra, people {{cultivated}} locally developed crops, including potatoes, quinoa, and tarwi. They also farmed {{crops that}} {{originated in the}} coastal regions and in the North, including ají, peanuts, beans, and maize. Animal husbandry kept pace with agricultural development, with the domestication of the local animals llama, alpaca, and the guinea pig, {{as well as the}} coastal Muscovy duck. The domestication of <b>camelids</b> during this period laid the basis for the pastoral tradition that continues to this day.|$|E
25|$|Transhumance is {{currently}} practiced {{at least in}} Argentina, Chile, Peru and Bolivia, {{as well as in}} the Brazilian Pantanal. It mainly involves movement of cattle in the Pantanal and in parts of Argentina. In the Altiplano, communities of indigenous people depend on raising <b>camelids,</b> especially llamas. Herds of goats are managed by transhumance in North Neuquén and South Mendoza, while sheep are more used in the Patagonian plains. Criollos and indigenous peoples use transhumant practices in areas of South America.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other {{domestic}} species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. The archaeological and genetic {{data suggest that}} long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks – including donkeys, horses, New and Old World <b>camelids,</b> goats, sheep, and pigs – was common. One study has concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars into pigs and created domestication islands in the genome. The same process may also apply to {{other domestic}}ated animals.|$|E
25|$|The dog was {{the first}} domesticated vertebrate, and was {{established}} across Eurasia {{before the end of}} the Late Pleistocene era, well before cultivation and before the domestication of other animals. The archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks – including donkeys, horses, New and Old World <b>camelids,</b> goats, sheep, and pigs – was common. Given its importance to humans and its value as a model of evolutionary and demographic change, domestication has attracted scientists from archaeology, palaeontology, anthropology, botany, zoology, genetics, and the environmental sciences.|$|E
25|$|The male {{dromedary}} camel has {{an organ}} called a dulla in its throat, a large, inflatable sac he extrudes {{from his mouth}} when in rut to assert dominance and attract females. It resembles a long, swollen, pink tongue hanging {{out of the side}} of its mouth. Camels mate by having both male and female sitting on the ground, with the male mounting from behind. The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session. <b>Camelids</b> are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position.|$|E

25|$|The puna zone is {{composed}} of high, cold grasslands, suitable largely for pasture by <b>camelids,</b> the domesticated llama and alpaca, {{as well as the}} wild vicuña and guanaco. The former were used as not only as pack animals, but also for their meat and wool. Vicuñas and guanacos, though undomesticated, were used for their fine and much-prized wool. Little agriculture is performed in the puna, though in the Bolivian altiplano intensive agriculture was possible through the use of waru waru raised bed agriculture, which used specialized irrigation techniques to prevent frost from destroying crops.|$|E
25|$|Llamas {{appear to}} have {{originated}} from the central plains of North America about 40 million years ago. They migrated to South America about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange. By {{the end of the}} last ice age (10,000–12,000 years ago), <b>camelids</b> were extinct in North America. As of 2007, there were over seven million llamas and alpacas in South America, and due to importation from South America in the late 20th century, there are now over 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas in the United States and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Urabarriu, {{the first}} stage, extends from 900 to 500 BCE.

The people hunted mainly deer and began to hunt and use <b>camelids.</b> They ate clams and shellfish from the Pacific Ocean, as well as guinea pigs and birds. Chavín people grew some maize and potatoes during this phase. The ceramics in the Urabarriu stage are highly influenced by other cultures.

25|$|According to {{molecular}} data, the New World and Old World <b>camelids</b> diverged 11 {{million years}} ago. In spite of this, these species can still hybridize and produce viable offspring. The cama is a camel–llama hybrid bred by scientists {{who wanted to}} see how closely related the parent species were. Scientists collected semen from a camel via an artificial vagina and inseminated a llama after stimulating ovulation with gonadotrophin injections. The cama has ears halfway between the length of camel and llama ears, no hump, longer legs than the llama, and partially cloven hooves. Like the mule, camas are sterile, despite both parents having the same number of chromosomes. The wild (Camelus ferus) camels are slightly close of both kinds of the dromedary camels and the Bactrian camels but they changed and separated from the Bactrian camels almost 1,000,000 years ago (Plasil, et al., 2016).|$|E
25|$|It is {{proposed}} {{that there were}} three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama, alpaca, and turkey); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel). The dog {{was the first to}} be domesticated, and was established across Eurasia {{before the end of the}} Late Pleistocene era, well before cultivation and before the domestication of other animals. Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. The archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks – including donkeys, horses, New and Old World <b>camelids,</b> goats, sheep, and pigs – was common.

The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.|$|E
25|$|Advances in DNA {{sequencing}} technology allow the nuclear genome to be accessed and analyzed {{in a population}} genetics framework. The increased resolution of nuclear sequences has demonstrated that gene flow is common, not only between geographically diverse domestic populations {{of the same species}} but also between domestic populations and wild species that never gave rise to a domestic population. The yellow leg trait possessed by numerous modern commercial chicken breeds was acquired via introgression from the grey junglefowl indigenous to South Asia. African cattle are hybrids that possess both a European Taurine cattle maternal mitochondrial signal and an Asian Indicine cattle paternal Y-chromosome signature. Numerous other bovid species, including bison, yak, banteng, and gaur also hybridize with ease. Cats and horses have been shown to hybridize with many closely related species, and domestic honey bees have mated with so many different species they now possess genomes more variable than their original wild progenitors. The archaeological and genetic data suggests that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks - including donkeys, horses, New and Old World <b>camelids,</b> goats, sheep, and pigs - was common. Bidirectional gene flow between domestic and wild reindeer continues today.|$|E
