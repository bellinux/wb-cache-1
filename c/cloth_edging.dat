50|$|The {{distinctive}} rifle {{green and}} red uniform of the old Baluch battalions {{was adopted by the}} entire regiment. The officers wore a red boss surmounted by a silver 'X' on field and forage caps, while the old battalion badges were worn on pagris and helmets by the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th Battalions. It was not until 1945 that a single cap badge was adopted by the regiment on introduction of berets during the Second World War. It consisted of the Roman numeral 'X' within a crescent moon, a Tudor crown above and the title scroll below, all in white metal. The badges of rank were in black metal with red <b>cloth</b> <b>edging,</b> while the lanyard was of rifle green cord with two red runners. Another distinctive feature of Baluchi uniforms were plain silver ball buttons worn on service and mess dresses.|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the fabric-forming {{mechanism}} of the multi-opening weaving machine {{and the process of}} formation of the fabric by the rotor reed. The purpose of the work: the improvement of reliability of the fabric-forming {{mechanism of the}} multiopening weaving machine in the range of the working frequencies to 1000 rev/min and the improvement of the fabric quality. Obtained have been the physical and mathematical model of the dynamics of the formation mechanism driven screw conveyor with the intermediate screw supports and the process of the cloth formation by the rotor reed; the dependencies for the design of the screw conveyor bushings tightening force, its radical beat, the permissible clearances between the shuttle and the guide elements, deformation of the <b>cloth</b> <b>edging,</b> the force of surf and surfing stripe in the multiopening weaving. The results have been used in creating the multiopening weaving machines of the second generation MTM- 180 - 2 P and TMM- 180 type with the high speed characteristics and with the operation of machines TMM- 360. A selection of the working frequencies has been realized, the permissible values of the number of the clothforming mechanism have been designed; the ways for eleimination of the sterness defects have been planned. In 1994, the experimental specimens of the multiopening weaving machines of the second generation TMM- 180 and MTM- 180 - 2 P have been made. The field of application: the creation, investigation and operation of the multiopening weaving machinesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
