5000|$|As {{efforts to}} curb illegal {{distribution}} and file sharing have intensified worldwide, the Indonesian popular music {{industry has been}} compelled to face the legal and financial ramifications of these activities. For example, a legal initiative concerning royalty payments for the kroncong song Bengawan Solo, composed by the Javanese songwriter Gesang Martohartono in 1949 and well-known and recorded {{in a number of}} Asian countries, became a matter of national controversy in 1989-1990 and created an awareness of cultural property and heritage that had not been there before. Nevertheless, infringement continues to shape the dynamic of the Indonesian popular music industry, particularly with respect to the illegal sale of [...] "bootleg" [...] audiocassettes recordings by American and European artists re-taped in Asia and sold at roughly a quarter of their original price. Although sales of these items had virtually ended by 1997, at the beginning of 2002 copyright violation had increased again to previously unknown levels. According to Arnel Affandi, the general manager of the Association of Recording Industries in Indonesia (ASIRI) for 2002-2005, it was estimated by the United States Trade Representative that in 1997 only 12% of the <b>CDs</b> <b>and</b> <b>audio</b> <b>cassettes</b> sold in the archipelago were illegal copies. In February 2002, 5 out of 6 of the audio cassettes, CDs and VCDs produced were illegal copies. The Office of the United States Trade Representative has placed Indonesia on the priority watch list for violating copyright laws, especially with respect to VCDs.|$|E
