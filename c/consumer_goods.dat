5|$|The Ninth Five-Year Plan {{delivered}} a change: {{for the first}} time industrial consumer products out-produced industrial capital goods. <b>Consumer</b> <b>goods</b> such as watches, furniture and radios were produced in abundance. The plan still left the bulk of the state's investment in industrial capital-goods production. This outcome was not seen as a positive sign {{for the future of the}} Soviet state by the majority of top party functionaries within the government; by 1975 <b>consumer</b> <b>goods</b> were expanding 9% slower than industrial capital-goods. The policy continued despite Brezhnev's commitment to make a rapid shift of investment to satisfy Soviet consumers and lead to an even higher standard of living. This did not happen.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} these changes had little practical effect, possibly due to opposition by the planners and confusion or fear among cadres.

5|$|Because of {{the tight}} rationing, a black market {{in food and}} other <b>consumer</b> <b>goods</b> emerged. Food {{on the black market}} was {{extremely}} expensive.

5|$|During the {{communist}} era, rapid urbanization {{and growth of}} heavy industry occurred. Whole villages in the coal mining areas were destroyed by the mining activity.

5|$|The German economy {{suffered}} severe setbacks {{after the}} end of World War I, partly because of reparations payments required under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for <b>consumer</b> <b>goods,</b> economic chaos and food riots. When the government failed to make the reparations payments in January 1923, French troops occupied German industrial areas along the Ruhr and widespread civil unrest followed.|$|E

40|$|The {{first attempt}} to get {{statistical}} demand functions was made by H. L. Moore. H. Schultz, taking after Moore's research, worked out his bulky volume, "The Theory and Measurement of demand, 1938 ". Since then, quite a few demand functions of various goods and of various forms have been calculated by many investigators. Though the history of statistical demand function {{can be traced back}} to comparatively old times, we can not frequently expect good results when we make an attempt to get a demand function of producer's or intermediate goods. In this field of empirical demand function, many problems have still been left untouched. Firms demand intermediate goods because they are useful to produce other <b>goods,</b> while <b>consumer's</b> <b>goods</b> are demanded to keep consumer's lives alive and comfortable. Accordingly, when we try to get statistical demand functions of intermediate goods, we must take into account this fact. We will not be able to expect to get a good demand function of intermediate goods if we apply the same method adopted to get a demand function of <b>consumer's</b> <b>goods.</b> The magnitude of demand for intermediate goods depend upon that of final demand. A firm that produces <b>consumer's</b> <b>goods</b> demands enough intermediate goods to supply a certain amount of <b>consumer's</b> <b>goods</b> which will counterbalance the anticipated demand for the goods. This kind of demand for intermediate goods is apparently caused by the final demand. It will in turn cause, another demand for intermediate goods. Thus final demand will stimulate demand for intermediate goods from industry to industry. In this paper, putting an importance to the causality from the final demand to the intermediate goods, I tried to present a method of short-range forecasting, applying it topaper pulp and pulp wood industries...|$|R

5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}.

If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low.

Since the <b>consumer</b> <b>good</b> is non-tradable, the downstream industry locates in both countries and {{can be viewed as}} made by a set of multinational firms. On the one hand joint location of the upstream firms is caused by a localization economy and by the intensity of the demand addressed to the industry. On the other hand production and transport costs of the input lead to dispersed locations by the upstream firms. If the input suppliers agglomerate, the neighboring downstream plant operates with a larger size that the distant one.
