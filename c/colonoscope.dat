40|$|A {{protocol}} for the disinfection of gastroduodenoscopes, retrograde cholangiopancreatography endoscopes and <b>colonoscopes</b> using endoscope washers is described.

After treatment with 2 % Steranios added to the washer, less than 1 micro-organism/ml liquid was found in the following units: 83 % of the <b>colonoscopes,</b> 83 % of the oesophagogastroduodenoscopes, 83 % of the main channels of the retrograde cholangiopancreatography endoscopes and 75 % of the auxiliary channels of the latter instruments. In 14 % of the <b>colonoscopes,</b> 42 % of the gastroduodenoscopes, 42 % of the main and 50 % of auxiliary channels in the retrograde cholangiopancreatography endoscopes there were no signs of microbial growth in the wash liquid. The results obtained indicated that this protocol allowed adequate disinfection of the endoscope channels, structurally {{the most difficult part of}} the instrument to disinfect. Emphasis is given to the degree by which instrument contamination can increase during overnight storage, suggesting that endoscopes need to be submitted to further disinfection after overnight storage. Moreover, the water flowing into the washers can also cause instrument recontamination, particularly during the final rinses.

Duodenoscopes, <b>colonoscopes,</b> and bronchoscopes (all Olympus endoscopes) were included in the simulated use testing. Each endoscope type was tested in triplicate and all channels and two surface sites were sampled for each scope. The clinical study evaluated patient-used duodenoscopes, bronchoscopes, <b>colonoscopes,</b> and gastroscopes (scopes used for emergency procedures were excluded) that had only a bedside flush prior to being processed in the ECR (i. e. no manual cleaning). There were 10 to 15 endoscopes evaluated post-cleaning and to ensure the entire ECR cycle was effective, 5 endoscopes were evaluated post-cleaning and post-high level disinfection. All channels and two external surface locations were sampled to evaluate the residual organic and microbial load. Effective cleaning of endoscope surfaces and channels was deemed to have been achieved if there was 2 of residual protein, 2 of residual hemoglobin and 10 viable bacteria/cm 2. Published data indicate that routine manual cleaning can achieve these endpoints so the ECR cleaning efficacy must meet or exceed these to establish that the ECR cleaning cycle could replace manual cleaning Results In the clinical study 75 patient-used scopes were evaluated post cleaning and 98. 8 % of surfaces and 99. 7 % of lumens met or surpassed the cleaning endpoints set for protein, hemoglobin and bioburden residuals. In the simulated-use study 100 % of the Olympus <b>colonoscopes,</b> duodenoscopes and bronchoscopes evaluated met or surpassed the cleaning endpoints set for protein, and bioburden residuals (hemoglobin was not evaluated). Conclusions The ECR cleaning cycle provides an effective automated approach that ensures surfaces and channels of flexible endoscopes are adequately cleaned after having only a bedside flush but no manual cleaning. It is crucial to note that endoscopes used for emergency procedures or where reprocessing is delayed for more than one hour MUST still be manually cleaned prior to placing them in the ECR. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{instrument}} {{channels of}} gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopes may be heavily contaminated with bacteria even after high-level disinfection (HLD). The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines emphasize {{the benefits of}} manually brushing endoscope channels and using automated endoscope reprocessors (AERs) for disinfecting endoscopes. In this study, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of decontamination using reprocessors after HLD by comparing the cultured samples obtained from biopsy channels (BCs) of GI endoscopes and the internal surfaces of AERs. Methods We conducted a 5 -year prospective study. Every month random consecutive sampling was carried out after a complete reprocessing cycle; 420 rinse and swabs samples were collected from BCs and internal surface of AERs, respectively. Of the 420 rinse samples collected from the BC of the GI endoscopes, 300 {{were obtained from the}} BCs of gastroscopes and 120 from BCs of <b>colonoscopes.</b> Samples were collected by flushing the BCs with sterile distilled water, and swabbing the residual water from the AERs after reprocessing. These samples were cultured to detect the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and mycobacteria. Results The number of culture-positive samples obtained from BCs (13. 6 %, 57 / 420) was significantly higher than that obtained from AERs (1. 7 %, 7 / 420). In addition, the number of culture-positive samples obtained from the BCs of gastroscopes (10. 7 %, 32 / 300) and <b>colonoscopes</b> (20. 8 %, 25 / 120) were significantly higher than that obtained from AER reprocess to gastroscopes (2. 0 %, 6 / 300) and AER reprocess to <b>colonoscopes</b> (0. 8 %, 1 / 120). Conclusions Culturing rinse samples obtained from BCs provides a better indication of the effectiveness of the decontamination of GI endoscopes after HLD than culturing the swab samples obtained from the inner surfaces of AERs as the swab samples only indicate whether the AERs are free from microbial contamination or not. </p...|$|R

At the same time a surgeon introduces laparoscopic ports into the patient's abdomen. Typically one or two ports are necessary. Through one port a laparoscope is introduced (usually through a 12 mm port in the umbilicus) and another port is used for introduction of a laparoscopic instrument, such as a grasper. As the colonoscopy is being performed the laparoscopic instruments are utilized to position the colon as needed to assist with advancement of the <b>colonoscope.</b> This is accomplished by placing counter pressure where the scope is turning or holding the colon in a way to reduce angulation.|$|E

40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} the third most common cancer in men and {{the second most common}} cancer in women worldwide. Diagnosing {{colorectal}} has been increasingly successful due to advances in technology. Flexible endoscopy is considered to be an effective method for early diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal cancer, making it a popular choice for screening programs. However, millions of people who may benefit from endoscopic colorectal cancer screening fail to have the procedure performed. Main reasons include psychological barriers due to the indignity of the procedure, fear of procedure related pain, bowel preparation discomfort, and potential need for sedation. Therefore, an urgent need for new technologies addressing these issues clearly exists. In this review, we discuss a set of advanced endoscopic technologies for colorectal cancer screening that are either already available or close to clinical trial. In particular, we focus on visual-inspection-only advanced flexible <b>colonoscopes,</b> interventional <b>colonoscopes</b> with alternative propulsion mechanisms, wireless capsule colonoscopy, and technologies for intraprocedural bowel cleansing. Many of these devices have the potential to reduce exam related patient discomfort, obviate the need for sedation, increase diagnostic yield, reduce learning curves, improve access to screening, and possibly avert the need for a bowel preparation...|$|R

Hence {{our aim was to}} examine whether dipslides, which are normally used in other areas for detecting microorganisms, can also be used as a rapid self-control method for processed endoscopes. Methods: We selected 18 commercially available dipslides and examined the rinse solutions of non-processed gastroscopes and <b>colonoscopes.</b> The samples were diluted and examined using dipslides and additionally plated on TSA and Endo Agar serving as reference media. Results: 1. The median of almost all dipslides showed equal or higher bacterial counts than the both reference medias. 2.

All dipslides gave higher bacterial counts for <b>colonoscopes</b> than for gastroscopes related to TSA. 4. Related to Endo Agar dipslides gave comparable results as the reference medium in colonoscopies. Conclusions: Dipslides should not be viewed as a substitute for routine laboratory analyses. Some of the examined dipslides can be recommended for screening of the endoscope reprocessing results, especially swellable dipslides with a low detection limit.
