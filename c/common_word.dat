25|$|Normally the Latin or Greek inflectional ending is {{replaced}} with the Esperanto inflectional ending ‚àío. However, the original inflection will occasionally be retained, {{as if it were}} part of the root, in order to disambiguate from a more <b>common</b> <b>word.</b> For example, a virus (from Latin vir-us) is virus-o instead of the expected *vir-o in order to avoid confusion with vir-o (a man), and the Latin root corp-us is the source of both korp-o (a living body) and korpus-o (a military corps). Similarly, when the sound ƒ• {{is replaced}} with k, as it commonly is (see Esperanto phonology), the word ƒ•oro (a chorus) is replaced with koruso to avoid creating a homonym with koro (a heart). The redundant inflection may have been inspired by Lithuanian, which otherwise contributed relatively little to Esperanto: compare fokuso (focus), kokoso (coconut), lotuso (lotus), patoso (pathos), radiuso (radius), sinuso (sine), and viruso (virus), with Lithuanian fokusas, kokosas, lotosas, patosas, radiusas, sinusas, and virusas (virus) vs. vyras (man).|$|E

25|$|In December, 2012, William Cheswick {{wrote an}} article {{published}} in ACM magazine that included the mathematical possibilities of how easy or difficult it would be to break passwords that are constructed using the commonly recommended, and sometimes followed, standards of today. In his article, William showed that a standard eight character alpha-numeric password could withstand a brute force attack of ten million attempts per second, and remain unbroken for 252 days. Ten million attempts each second is the acceptable rate of attempts using a multi-core system that most users would have access to. A much greater degree of attempts, at the rate of 7 billion per second, could also be achieved when using modern GPUs. At this rate, the same 8 character alpha-numeric password could be broken in approximately 30 seconds. Increasing the password complexity to a 13 character alpha-numeric password increases the time needed to crack it to more than 900,000 years at 7 billion attempts per second. This is, of course, assuming the password does not use a <b>common</b> <b>word</b> that a dictionary attack could break much sooner. Using a password of this strength reduces the obligation to change it as often as many organizations require, including the U.S. Government, as it could not be reasonably broken in such a short period of time.|$|E

500|$|The {{history of}} the term conatus {{is that of a}} series of subtle tweaks in meaning and {{clarifications}} of scope developed over the course of two and a half millennia. Successive philosophers to adopt the term put their own personal twist on the concept, each developing the term differently such that it now has no accepted definition. The earliest authors to discuss conatus wrote primarily in Latin, basing their usage on ancient Greek concepts. These thinkers therefore used [...] "conatus" [...] not only as a technical term but as a <b>common</b> <b>word</b> and in a general sense. In archaic texts, the more technical usage is difficult to discern from the more common one, and they are also hard to differentiate in translation. In English translations, the term is italicized when used in the technical sense or translated and followed by conatus in brackets. Today, conatus is rarely used in the technical sense, since modern physics uses concepts such as inertia and conservation of momentum that have superseded it. It has, however, been a notable influence on nineteenth- and twentieth-century thinkers such as Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Louis Dumont.|$|E

500|$|The ancient Greeks {{had several}} words to {{indicate}} slaves, {{which leads to}} textual ambiguity when they are studied out of their proper context. In Homer, Hesiod and Theognis of Megara, the slave was called [...] (dm≈çs). The term has a general meaning but refers particularly to war prisoners taken as booty (in other words, property). During the classical period, the Greeks frequently used [...] (andrapodon), (literally, [...] "one with the feet of a man") as opposed to [...] (tetrapodon), [...] "quadruped" [...] or livestock. The most <b>common</b> <b>word</b> for slaves is [...] (doulos), used in opposition to [...] "free man" [...] ( [...] , ele√∫theros); an earlier form of the former appears in Mycenaean inscriptions as do-e-ro, [...] "male slave" [...] (or [...] "servant", [...] "bondman"; Linear B: [...] ), or do-e-ra, [...] "female slave" [...] (or [...] "maid-servant", [...] "bondwoman"; Linear B: [...] ). The verb [...] (which survives in Modern Greek, meaning [...] "work") can be used metaphorically for other forms of dominion, as of one city over another or parents over their children. Finally, the term [...] (oiketƒìs) was used, as meaning [...] "one who lives in house", referring to household servants.|$|E
500|$|The animal's name {{alludes to}} pigs in many European languages. The German word {{for them is}} , {{literally}} [...] "little sea pig", which has been translated into Polish as ≈õwinka morska, into Hungarian as tengerimalac, and into Russian as –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è —Å–≤–∏–Ω–∫–∞. This derives from the Middle High German name merswin. This originally meant [...] "dolphin" [...] and was used because of the animals' grunting sounds (which {{were thought to be}} similar). Many other, possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist. For example, sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs, which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat. The French term is [...] (Indian pig) or cobaye; the Dutch call it [...] (Guinean piglet) or cavia (while in some Dutch dialects it is called Spaanse rat); and in Portuguese, the guinea pig is variously referred to as , from the Tupi word via its Latinization, or as porquinho da √çndia (little Indian pig). This is not universal; for example, the <b>common</b> <b>word</b> in Spanish is [...] (little rabbit of the Indies). The Chinese refer to them as Ë±öÈº† (t√∫nsh«î, 'pig mouse'), and sometimes as Netherlands pig (Ëç∑Ëò≠Ë±¨, h√©l√°nzh≈´) or Indian mouse (Â§©Á´∫Èº†, tiƒÅnzh√∫sh«î). The Japanese word for guinea pig is [...] "„É¢„É´„É¢„ÉÉ„Éà" [...] (morumotto), which derives from the name of another mountain-dwelling rodent, the marmot; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843.|$|E
500|$|At {{the most}} basic level, a king's power rested on the {{existence}} of his bodyguard or war-band. In the British language, this was called the teulu, as in teulu Dewr (the [...] "War-band of Deira"). In Latin the word is either comitatus or tutores, or even familia; tutores is the most <b>common</b> <b>word</b> in this period, and derives for the Latin verb tueor, meaning [...] "defend, preserve from danger". The war-band functioned {{as an extension of the}} ruler's legal person, and was the core of the larger armies that were mobilised from time to time for campaigns of significant size. In peace-time, the war-band's activity was centred on the [...] "Great Hall". Here, in both Germanic and Celtic cultures, the feasting, drinking and other forms of male bonding that kept up the war-band's integrity would take place. In the epic poem Beowulf, the war-band was said to sleep in the Great Hall after the lord had retired to his adjacent bedchamber. It is not likely that any war-band in the period exceeded 120‚Äì150 men, as no hall structure having a capacity larger than this has been found by archaeologists in northern Britain. Pictish stones, like that at Aberlemno in Angus, show mounted and foot warriors with swords, spears, bows, helmets and shields. The large number of hill forts in Scotland may have made open battle less important than in Anglo-Saxon England and the relatively high proportion of kings who are recorded as dying in fires or drowning suggest that sieges were a more important part of warfare in Northern Britain.|$|E
