40|$|Antarctic Treaty <b>Consultative</b> <b>Parties</b> are {{entitled}} to participate in consensus-based governance of the continent through the annual Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings. To acquire consultative status, an interested Party must demonstrate “substantial research activity,” but no agreed mechanism exists {{to determine whether a}} Party has fulfilled this criterion. Parties have generally demonstrated substantial research activity with the construction of a research station, as suggested within the Treaty itself. However, this largely demonstrates logistical capacity, rather than research activity, and often results in major and persistent impacts on Antarctic terrestrial environments. Our study found that national investment in Antarctic infrastructure, estimated by the number of bed spaces at stations, was not a reliable indicator of scientific output. Therefore, we investigated metrics to evaluate research activity directly, and identified both the overall number of Antarctic papers and the proportion of national scientific output these represented as meaningful metrics. Such metrics could (1) demonstrate a nation’s level of research activity in Antarctica or (2) help <b>Consultative</b> <b>Parties</b> assess the level of research activity undertaken by a Party seeking to acquire consultative status. Our data showed that, even without land-based Antarctic infrastructure, Canada, Denmark and Switzerland may have reasonable grounds to demonstrate "substantial research activity" on a level comparable with existing <b>Consultative</b> <b>Parties.</b> The use of these metrics may help dispel any perceived requirement {{for the establishment of a}} research station to reach consultative status, by putting a greater emphasis on generation of scientific research outputs rather than construction of Antarctic infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Consultative</b> <b>Parties</b> to the Antarctic Treaty have {{frequently}} declared their collective ambition to manage Antarctica “in {{the interest of}} all mankind”. However, the concrete implications of these declarations are not clear. As part of an international research project, the authors asked people {{from different parts of}} the world to respond to a questionnaire about Antarctica, its values, and the way it should be managed. Notwithstanding differences in respondents’ nationalities, ages and the time of data collection, our results indicate that a significant proportion of the public values Antarctica both as a scientific laboratory and as one of the world’s last wildernesses. Is this ‘public’s dream’ of co-existence of science and wilderness a Mission Impossible? In this article, we contend that: 1) in theory, it is a Possible Mission that would connect well with the recognition of science and wilderness in the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) instruments; 2) in practice, science in Antarctica has gradual and cumulative impacts on all three main wilderness qualities of Antarctica (absence of permanent infrastructure, naturalness and large size); 3) currently, the co-existence of science and wilderness is not an important consideration in the management of human activities in Antarctica; and 4) in the future, unless a proactive and concerted effort is taken by the <b>Consultative</b> <b>Parties,</b> it appears to be a Mission Impossible, as the expansion of scientific activities and associated logistics remains uncontrolled, inexorably eroding the Antarctic wilderness. Recent ATS resolutions and high-level interventions may signify that Treaty Parties are becoming more aware of the need to increase their cooperation on the ground in Antarctica and hence, open up a space to allow the coexistence of science and wilderness in Antarctica to become possible. We propose the adoption of principles providing clear and concrete guidance on scientific facilities and international cooperation as a constructive step forward in realising the ‘public’s dream’ of coexistence of science and wilderness in Antarctica...|$|R
40|$|Connections between South Africa and Antarctica can {{be traced}} {{as far back as}} the 1700 s when European expeditions in search of the {{southern}} continent used Cape Town (and later Simonstown) as a base of operation. This link expanded considerably after formal British acquisition of the Cape of Good Hope in 1815, yet it was not until 1926 that an actual South African policy towards the Antarctic began to materialize. Once this policy was established it continued to be characterized by procrastination as well as resistance both from within and without South Africa. The history of South Africa's Antarctic policy can be divided into five periods: first, the commencement of the policy (focusing primarily on economic interests), 1926 - 1939; second, the pursuit of interests through the policy (focusing on political interests), 1944 - 1958; third, the entrenchment of South Africa's interests in the Antarctic (by securing South Africa's position within the Antarctic Treaty System), 1958 - 1960; fourth, the expansion of and foreign assault on the policy (under the auspices of the Antarctic Treaty System), 1960 - 1988; and fifth, the defence of and future prospects for the policy (from United Nation's calls for South Africa's exclusion from the Antarctic Treaty System), since 1982. While resistance from inside and outside the government during the first two periods resulted from inadequacies in the South African Antarctic policy itself, resistance in the final two periods has centred upon non-Antarctic issues. As South Africa has faced ever-increasing exclusion from international governmental organizations over opposition to Its apartheid policies, organizations such as the Antarctic Treaty Organization have inevitably been drawn into the debate. As a result, the <b>Consultative</b> <b>Parties</b> of the Antarctic Treaty (of which South Africa is one of the original twelve) have been forced to deal with the following question: to what extent will political issues outside the scope of the management policies of the Antarctic Treaty Organization be allowed to affect the functioning of the Antarctic Treaty System?

This study applies a new approach to understand what affects self-regulation, consisting of a literature review and agent-based modelling (ABM). The review identifies four challenges for self-regulation: operator commitment, tourism growth, operator diversification, and accidents. The ABM simulations help conceptualise the complex concepts and theories surrounding self-regulation. Self-regulation is measured by the capacity of the simulated self-regulatory system to maintain a majority membership at the end of 20 years. The model suggests that a number of the challenges are nonlinear and have tipping points.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Antarctic ’Reaty System has {{successfully}} managed Antarctica {{and the surrounding}} Southern Ocean since 1961 despite the existence of conflicting sovereignty claims and calls from the Third World for greater international participation in the continent’s management. The spectre of unregulated mining activities in Antarctica caused {{the parties to the}} Antarctic l h t y to negotiate the Convention for the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities in 1988. However, the entry into force of the convention is now being challenged by Australia and France, who propose a prohibition on mining in Antarctica and favour the negotiation of a comprehensive environmental protection regime for the Antarctic. The development of a world park in Antarctica has been mooted since 1972, and during the 1980 s various international environmental organizations gave enthusiastic support to the concept. A meeting of the Antarctic ’Iteaty <b>Consultative</b> <b>Parties</b> in 1989 resolved to further discuss in 1990 the implementation of comprehensive environmental protection measures in Antarctica. While 1990 may be a pivotal year in the current debate over the environmental future of Antarctica, 1991 is potentially more. significant, as the Antarctic ’Reaty will then become eligible for a comprehensive review.

40|$|As a site at {{the margin}} of {{terrestrial}} systems, Antarctica disrupts the usual practices of visual representation. This thesis investigates, what I call, chronogeographical approaches to visual culture within the Antarctic terrain. The material and theoretical chronogeographies of vision are mapped through the action of light, to elucidate on the shifting terrain of form - that is the Antarctic landscape. Historically, the thesis explores how the 1980 s anti-mining campaign, organised by environmental groups challenged the political and visual hegemony of the Antarctic Treaty <b>Consultative</b> <b>Parties.</b> The campaign highlighted the feedback between the circulation of images and initiatives to protect the Antarctic landscape. Situated within this visual economy, the thesis focuses on how representation demarcates abstract and imaginative spaces {{for the production of}} the landscape - creating fugitive images of Antarctic spatialities. The thesis follows the fugitive testimony of the image through fields of knowledge, from the arrest and flow of landscape to the aesthetics of mobility. Critical art practice is considered as an interstice that highlights the conditions under which landscapes are given visibility, both cognitively and optically. A stratum of histories, mappings and sitings, structure the investigation into the transmission, materiality, and memory embedded in different media employed in the production of Antarctica. Through this sedimentation of geographies, the thesis proposes that the limits of representation may be found in Antarctica. It is argued that this shattering of commonly available visual languages can be a means to aerate our creative explorations of place. From this site, broader issues about the economy of the visual and the limits of visibility are examined. The thesis concludes that only by attending to the complex geographies of the image can the geopolitical aesthetics of place be accounted for.

40|$|Vegetation is sparsely {{distributed}} over Antarctica's ice-free ground, {{and distinct}} plant communities {{are present in}} each of the continent's 15 recently identified Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (ACBRs). With rapidly increasing human activity in Antarctica, terrestrial plant communities are at risk of damage or destruction by trampling, overland transport and infrastructure construction, and the impacts of anthropogenically introduced species, as well as uncontrollable pressures such as fur seal activity and climate change. Under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, the conservation of plant communities can be enacted and facilitated through the designation of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs). In this study we examined the distribution within the 15 ACBRs of the 33 ASPAs whose explicit purpose includes protecting macroscopic terrestrial flora. Large omissions in the protection of Antarctic botanical diversity were found, with no protection of plant communities in six ACBRs and, in a further six, less than 0. 4 % of the ACBR area was included within an ASPA protecting vegetation. We completed the first normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) satellite remote sensing survey to provide baseline data on the extent of vegetation cover in all ASPAs designated for plant protection in Antarctica. Protected vegetation cover within the 33 ASPAs totalled 16. 1 km 2 for the entire Antarctic continent, with over half of this within a single protected area. Over 96 % of the protected vegetation was contained within two ACBRs, which together contribute only 7. 8 % of the continent's ice-free ground.

40|$|In {{the framing}} of any {{work on the}} law and {{politics}} of the Antarctic, {{there is always a}} great temptation on the part of an author to consider the other polar region, the Arctic, in any analysis. This stems not only from the similarities in climate, or the remote and wild nature of the geography of both regions. It is more fundamental, as the Antarctic 2 ̆ 7 s very name is itself derived from the Arctic, being literally the 2 ̆ 7 Anti-Arctic 2 ̆ 7 by virtue of its location {{at the opposite end of}} the world. Similarly, there has been substantial participation by many Arctic states in Antarctic affairs, most notably by Norway, Russia and the United States as original parties to the Antarctic Treaty, but more recently by Finland and Sweden as full <b>consultative</b> <b>parties,</b> and Canada and Denmark as non-consultative parties. This chapter will consider some similarities and differences between law and governance in the Arctic and Antarctic. It will consider the Antarctic, as would be expected, through the prism of the Antarctic Treaty and some of its associated instruments, but the Arctic will be considered in more narrow terms. Since the Arctic is dominated by the sovereign states at the periphery of the region, surrounding the ocean at its centre, there are many profound differences with the governance of the Antarctic. One exception to this can be found in the arrangements dealing with Svalbard, the archipelago containing the northernmost permanent settlement in the world. Arrangements for Svalbard were, like those in the Antarctic, concluded by an international agreement, with the participation of a number of great powers. Further, many of the objectives espoused in the treaty documents for both regions were broadly congruent, and a number of difficulties experienced have also been similar. Svalbard therefore provides an interesting counterpoint to the Antarctic, and provides an exercise in comparative problem-solving across the generations, inter-war and post- 1945...|$|R
40|$|The {{states that}} jointly manage Antarctica {{were not yet}} able to reach {{consensus}} {{on a number of}} specific Antarctic tourism management issues. While recognizing that many factors influence the international decision-making process, this chapter aims to explore one rarely discussed philosophical factor that may be of great significance for understanding the difficulties in reaching consensus: the possible differences in the human-nature relationship among the <b>Consultative</b> <b>Parties</b> (CPs) and expert organizations. Based on an explorative analysis of relevant documents, it is concluded that CPs and expert organizations consistently reject the “mastery” attitude, both in general Antarctic policy instruments and in tourism-specific documents. The relevant documents relating to two subthemes (the acceptability of permanent land-based tourism facilities and large-scale adventure or sporting events) show that there is a strong tendency to use “rational arguments” that do not reflect human-nature relationships; however, a closer look reveals that underneath these relatively neutral positions, substantially different human-nature attitudes appear to be hidden. These differences may not block consensus regarding general policy statements on Antarctic tourism, as these statements leave sufficient space for different interpretations; however, different attitudes towards nature may well constitute a hurdle in reaching consensus on concrete management issues. It is most likely that CPs with different human-nature relationships have different views on what the specific “values” of Antarctica are and how these values could best be protected, and, consequently, it is also most likely that these CPs have different opinions on what norms should be set in respect of specific tourism developments. This makes it understandable that the approach of the ATCM to focus strongly on (the desirability of) norm setting is not always successful. Underlining the explorative nature of this study, the authors would recommend further research on human-nature relationships in the Antarctic tourism context. More knowledge and consciousness of differences in human-nature attitudes might invite stakeholders to search for management solutions based on a greater understanding of each other’s convictions...|$|R

40|$|The {{establishment}} of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) {{on the high}} seas has recently emerged on the international agenda as a critical issue requiring the integration of novel approaches, international cooperation and political will. Since the high seas are subject to open access, the rights and obligations of States {{on the high seas}} can be ambiguous and confusing. There is a need to clarify how high seas marine conservation can be implemented under international law and in the Antarctic, both within and beyond the instruments of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). In recent years, Antarctic Treaty <b>Consultative</b> <b>Parties</b> have pondered the application of alternative international approaches and instruments in the region. This study seeks to contribute to this debate, assessing the ATS and key international instruments and approaches regarding their applicability to the high seas, comprehensiveness (assessed by species, in-situ or ex-situ conservation measures), progressiveness (application of the ecosystem or precautionary approach) and their legal status (soft or hard law, entry into force, Contracting Parties). Site selection for Southern Ocean MPAs is hindered by a lack of data on marine biodiversity. This study uses seabirds as surrogates for marine biodiversity. Drawing on a 20 -year database comprising over 140, 000 'at sea' seabird sightings, this study assesses the potential use of seabirds as surrogates for marine biodiversity in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Surrogate indices used were species density, richness, IUCN status and Shannon-Weaver diversity. The seabird observations were aggregated into 1 ° (n = 1952), 2 ° (n = 704) and 5 ° bins (ri = 177). Surrogates were classified as high, medium or low, with 'high' areas of greatest conservation value. The study identified 22 urgent priority areas where conservation action appears justified, with clusters near Heard and McDonald Islands, and Isles Crozet. Integrating policy with science and considering area selection techniques provides an objective contribution to Antarctic conservation planning. Antarctic marine conservation is best managed within the ATS, with strong involvement from the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. The ATS could, however be strengthened by applying the principles and approaches used by key international instruments, particularly the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The use of seabirds as surrogates has value in Antarctic conservation planning, but additional species or environmental data would improve the process...|$|R
40|$|As {{the number}} of people visiting the subantarctic and Antarctic increases, so do incidences of human-wiidiife interaction, in these regions, Antarctic Treaty <b>Consultative</b> <b>Parties</b> conduct and support {{scientific}} research, and commercial tourism is increasing dramatically. At several locations, penguins can be exposed to considerable human activity, often during critical periods of breeding and moult. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} effective and timely management of human-wiidiife interactions that reflect the high conservation values of these areas. On subantarctic Macquarie island (54 ° 30 'S 158 ° 57 'E) breeding penguins commonly experience pedestrian visits from government expeditioners or commercial tourists. From 2001 - 2005, a project was undertaken to investigate responses to pedestrian activity by King Aptenodytes patagonicus, Gentoo Pygoscelis papua and Royal Eudyptes schlegeli penguins. The overall aim of the project was to produce management-oriented information for both government operations and commercial tourism on the island, and elsewhere in Antarctic and subantarctic. Experimental and observational studies were employed to quantify aspects of the physiology, behaviour and reproductive success of the three penguin species when exposed to pedestrian activity. Experiments were designed to address the following key management issues: 1) the efficacy of current minimum approach distance guidelines; 2) the effect of visitor group size; 3) the role of habituation; 4) the sensitivity of penguins during different breeding phases; and 5) inter-species variation in responses. Key results include: a) a single pedestrian visit to 5 m (the current minimum approach guideline) to incubating Royal penguins did not produce more than a minor or transitory impact on the birds, but did elicit a stronger response than either predator overflights or interactions with aggressive conspecifics; b) guarding Gentoo penguin responses to human visitors increased in intensity with a larger visitor group size; c) Gentoo penguins exposed to frequent, high levels of human activity appeared to have habituated to pedestrians, while Gentoos in areas of low human activity appeared sensitive to visitation, suggesting that habituation and previous exposure to human activity need to be considered when managing human-penguin interactions; d) Royal penguins displayed elevated responses to visitation during incubation and moult, compared to guard and creche, highlighting these breeding stages as more sensitive periods; and e) Gentoo penguins showed the strongest reaction to visitation when compared to King and Royal penguins, demonstrating inter-species differences in sensitivity to the stimuli examined. By investigating how penguin responses to pedestrian activity vary, this project has produced valuable information for the management of human-penguin interactions on Macquarie Island, with application to other subantarctic and Antarctic locations...|$|R
40|$|Antarctic tourism {{represents}} {{the largest and}} fastest growing commercial activity on the Antarctic continent. Under consideration of its unprecedented growth and diversification, the Antarctic tourism sector is viewed with increasing scrutiny and concern. This concern is expressed in discussions surrounding the success and effectiveness of the existing regulatory framework for Antarctic tourism and asks what changes might be required to adequately protect the Antarctic continent in the future. Viewpoints and interests among Antarctic tourism operators, policy-makers, researchers and other stakeholders diverge, and Antarctic tourism is discussed as being either or both benefactor and detractor to the environmental and political integrity of Antarctica. This thesis discusses, regulations drawing on regime theory, the effectiveness of Antarctic tourism. It postulates {{the theory that the}} combined regulatory efforts of Antarctic Treaty <b>Consultative</b> <b>Parties</b> (ATCPs) and industry self-regulation through the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) define the Antarctic tourism regime. Using interviews and a Delphi study as the primary methods of inquiry, stakeholder viewpoints on regulatory and operational characteristics of Antarctic tourism were collected and integrated into a discussion of the effectiveness of the current regulatory regime and an assessment of potential options for regulating Antarctic tourism in the future. The interviews provide insights particularly into operational matters and the in situ practice of tour operators and their compliance with existing regulations. The Delphi study focuses on how the current regulatory issues are addressed, how rules and regulation are enacted and whether the current regulatory framework needs improvement. The thesis research shows that Antarctic tourism stakeholders are concerned about the increasing scale and diversification of Antarctic tourism and generally subscribe to a conservation imperative when assessing potential options for the future regulation of Antarctic tourism. The Antarctic Treaty System is regarded as being stable and having matured over the years, although the regime has not been tested to any great extent. Tourism development in the Antarctic may well prove to be a first test of the stability and success of the Antarctic Treaty System. Stakeholders desire a continued strong partnership between Antarctic Treaty Parties and IAATO regarding the regulation of Antarctic tourism, but conclude that in view of the rapid development of Antarctic tourism, structural, institutional and legislative changes are necessary if Antarctic tourism regulation is to remain successful. The thesis argues that these necessary changes do not inevitably involve a complete overhaul of the existing regulatory regime for Antarctic tourism and that a new overarching regulatory instrument such as a tourism convention may neither be the most desirable nor feasible approach to regulating tourism to the Antarctic. Instead, this thesis research suggests that regulatory improvements need to build on the strengths of the current regime and on a strategic vision that should guide the future regulation of Antarctic tourism...|$|R
50|$|On 12 September 1998, {{following}} {{the fall of}} the New Order, IPKI declared itself as a political party known as the League of Supporters of Indonesian Independence Party. Its aims included implementing and applying the state philosophy of Pancasila in daily life in order to realise national aims. The party program called for putting sovereignty back {{in the hands of the}} people, limiting the presidency to two terms and striving for regional autonomy. It supported the continuation of a social-political role for the Indonesian armed forces and for the president to be elected by the People's <b>Consultative</b> Assembly. The <b>party</b> won 0.22 percent of the vote, giving it one seat in the People's Representative Council. As it did not win enough votes in this election to take part in the 2004 vote, along with seven other parties, it merged into the Indonesian Unity Party.|$|R
40|$|The failings {{of parties}} {{are one of}} the central {{problems}} of contemporary democracies. What can be done to revive citizen participation? In this article, we present a novel party participatory decision-making mechanism named "doparies". They are procedures that are nationally or locally implemented within and by parties, and permit any voter who declares to be an elector of that party (open doparies) or party members (internal doparies) to vote regarding crucial and controversial decisions during the period between one election and another. Whereas primaries are done before elections for choosing party candidates, doparies are done after elections for making party choices on issues. Doparies represent a bidirectional communication system between voters and representatives, and would retain the advantages of primaries (party-voters relationship) and referenda (debate before the vote), but would limit the excessive personalization of politics focusing on issues and not on people. There are both propositional doparies, allowing citizens to raise problems that are absent from their party political agenda, and <b>consultative</b> ones, allowing <b>parties</b> to hear the true voice of their voters, who, differently from what happens in polls, are informed by debates in party circles. We suggest that doparies are a new combination of deliberative and aggregative processes, and hypothesize that they can counteract parties 2 ̆ 7 crisis and abstention. Procedures similar to doparies are now part of the Italian Democratic Party statute and prominent national leaders have gathered signatures to organize local consultations. The use of primaries by Italian left-wing parties has had a contagious effect on right-wing ones as well as European ones. The same could happen with doparies...|$|R
