5|$|On September25, the {{government}} of Spain approved $1.07million in food assistance for Cuba. On September29, {{the government}} of Japan sent water equipment, soap, towels, and emergency health kits worth $119,200 to the affected areas in Cuba. By February 1999, the Japanese Government had provided Cuba with nearly $1million in disaster funds. An emergency <b>cash</b> <b>grant</b> of $50,000 was also given to Cuba by the United Nations. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized about 8,700 volunteers to assist victims of the storm in the 900 shelters set up throughout the island. Plastic sheeting was to be distributed {{for about a week}} for residents to patch holes in the roof of their homes. The National Council of Churches sent relief goods valued at $70,000 to the Cuban Government on October9. By February 1999, the Cuban Red Cross distributed over 30,000 sheets of roofing to nearly 5,500 people in three provinces. Several months after the storm, the Cuban Government reported that they had allocated about $38million in funds for Hurricane Georges.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{provided}} for a <b>cash</b> <b>grant</b> of $12.5 million (about $94 million at 2007 prices) to be disbursed to the Alaskan {{government in a}} number of phases, to fund the construction of mental health facilities in the territory. To meet the ongoing costs of the program, the bill transferred one million acres (4,000km²) of federally owned land in Alaska to the ownership of the proposed new Alaska Mental Health Trust as a grant-in-aid—the federal government owned about 99% of the land of Alaska at the time. The trust would then {{be able to use the}} assets of the transferred land (principally mineral and forestry rights) to obtain an ongoing revenue stream to fund the Alaskan mental health program. Similar provisions had applied in other US territories to support the provision of public facilities prior to the achievement of statehood.|$|E
5|$|On November7, despite no {{official}} appeal for international aid, {{the governments of}} France and the United States provided $34,783 and $25,000 in funds. The request for assistance came the following day, with the Philippines requesting food, water, medicine, emergency supplies, and heavy machinery. A team from the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization, specializing with relief coordination and flood management, was also sent. The Red Cross appealed for $418,000 to support 15,000families for one month. A <b>cash</b> <b>grant</b> of $17,300 from the United Kingdom was received on November8. Two United States Air Force AC-130s from Subic bay naval base flew to Cebu carrying ready-to-eat meals. International funding reached $2.5million on November12, with grants of $1.05million, $1million, $188,000 from the Netherlands, Japan, and Australia respectively. Additionally, the United States provided 55,000 packages of food rations. This total nearly doubled two days later with grants from the United Nations Development Programme, World Food Programme, World Vision International, Médecins Sans Frontières, Caritas, various branches of the Red Cross, and the governments of Canada and New Zealand. Ultimately, approximately $5.8million was provided in international assistance from 13nations, the United Nations, the Red Cross, and various non-governmental organizations.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the late}} 1990s, all Hong Kong taxis ran on diesel fuel, aside from 4-passenger taxis which ran on petrol. In 1996, a few taxis that ran on LPG {{appeared}} {{as part of}} the government's test project for alternative fuel. This project proved successful, leading to all new taxis being factory-built LPG since 1999. To speed up the replacement of diesel taxis with LPG ones, from mid 2000 to the end of 2003, the government offered a <b>cash</b> <b>grant</b> to each taxi owner who purchased a new LPG taxi during that period. Since 1 August 2001, no more diesel taxis were allowed to be imported into Hong Kong, and from 1 January 2006, driving a diesel taxi on the streets of Hong Kong became illegal. Therefore, all taxis in Hong Kong are currently running on LPG.|$|E

30|$|The paper {{contributes}} to several literatures: the resource curse and rentier state debates, {{the debate about}} subsidy reform in the developing world, and the broader literature on the “basic income” concept that extends beyond politics, development, and economics into political philosophy and whose useful insights (and caveats) are often ignored in the rentier <b>cash</b> <b>grants</b> discussion. By showing how direct <b>cash</b> <b>grants</b> can substitute for cheap, fossil-based energy, it provides a rough political and economic roadmap for facilitating broader energy transitions in HRCs, particularly the very energy-intensive GCC.|$|R
30|$|The {{literature}} on <b>cash</b> <b>grants</b> in conventional rentier states also (both implicitly and explicitly) {{points to a}} number of potential weaknesses of such schemes. Many authors, for example, assume that individuals will use cash more smartly than governments. A citizens’ income in HRCs does not necessarily require this assumption, as its objective of incentivizing citizens to join the private labor market would obtain independently of how citizens would spend their grants. As important, HRC <b>cash</b> <b>grants</b> could be financed through subsidy reforms and reduced public sector recruitment, thereby attacking particularly inefficient ways of using public resources. Closely related, the argument that <b>cash</b> <b>grants</b> could “deny a cash strapped government the opportunity of improving the delivery of its services to its citizens” [73] or to build critical infrastructure (Alan Gelb and Majerowicz [61], p. 9) is less relevant for HRCs, whose delivery of public services and infrastructure spending could remain untouched as subsidies and surplus public sector employment are reduced.|$|R

2500|$|The first Prime Minister gave British Columbia {{the choice}} of Dunsmuir or Lewis M.
