50|$|The <b>Cunene</b> <b>horse</b> <b>{{mackerel}}</b> (Trachurus trecae) is {{a species}} named after mackerel {{in the family}} Carangidae. Their maximum reported length is 35 cm, and the maximum reported weight is 2.0 kg.|$|E
50|$|In the South-West Atlantic a peak {{was reached}} in the mid-1980s and catches now {{fluctuate}} between 1.7 and 2.6 million tons. The most important species, the Argentine shortfin squid, which reached half a million tons in 2013 or half the peak value, is considered fully fished to overfished. Another important species was the Brazilian sardinella, with a production of 100,000 tons in 2013 it is now considered overfished. Half the stocks {{in this area are}} being fished at unsustainable levels: Whitehead’s round herring has not yet reached fully fished but <b>Cunene</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> is overfished.

Data have been obtained by the 'Scientific Observer Program', which monitors the catch (both landings and discards) of the EU fishery for small pelagics in Mauritania. The EU fleet in Mauritania focuses mainly on the group of sardinella (Sardinella aurita and Sardinella maderensis).

40|$|Large {{sardinella}} (Sardinella maderensis and Sardinella aurita) in warm {{waters off}} the coast of Africa are known to be a challenge for pelagic trawl sampling, for example during acoustic surveys for abundance estimation. We observed the swimming behaviour of sardinella mixed with other pelagic species, mainly <b>Cunene</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus trecae), during sampling with a pelagic trawl {{in the course of a}} study of swimming behaviour and endurance in the trawl belly and escape behaviour during hauling. The study consisted of two pelagic trawl surveys with R/V “Dr. Fridtjof Nansen” {{off the coast}} of Angola. We observed the fish with a trawl sonde in the trawl mouth, from a towed vehicle with sonar and camera positioned above the trawl belly or the trawl mouth, and finally with a camera with video recorder in the trawl belly. The behaviour of the fish was quantified from the video recordings by observing the swimming speed of the fish relative to the trawl and by recording the frequency of different behaviours. Two different reactions of schools were observed. We defined a “fright” reaction as a sudden reaction, where individuals swam in different directions and the collective school organisation collapsed for a few seconds. The second type of school reaction, the “adjust” reaction, did not cause the school organisation to disintegrate, but caused the whole school to gradually change its swimming direction by moving closer to one of the sides or the bottom of the trawl. The fish were also observed to swim along within the trawl for tens of minutes, possibly for up to around an hour. The main conclusion of this study is that pelagic species in warm water have the potential to actively swim forward in the trawl and escape during hauling. This could have substantial consequences for trawl sampling during surveys in terms of species- and sizedependent selectivity...|$|E
40|$|The twelfth {{meeting of}} the FAO Working Group on the Assessment of Small Pelagic Fish off Northwest Africa was held in Dakar, Senegal from 21 to 25 May 2012. Total catch of small pelagic fish for the period 1990 to 2011 has been {{fluctuating}} {{with an average of}} around 1. 8 million tonnes, with an overall general increasing trend since 1994. Although important changes were observed in the abundance and exploitation level for some of the stocks, the overall general situation with respect to the state of the different stocks was found to be similar to the results of the 2011 Working Group, {{with the exception of the}} Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) which this year was considered overexploited. The <b>Cunene</b> <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus trecae) showed some improvement and is considered fully exploited. The Small Pelagic Working Group recommends a decrease in catch and effort on the horse mackerels stocks to ensure sustainable harvesting of these stocks. The catches of round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) are high for the last three years. The Working Group continues to be concerned about this stock and considers it is overexploited. The sardine stock in Zone A+B is still considered overexploited and the Working Group therefore maintains its recommendation from the previous years that the catch should not exceed 400 000 tonnes. Sardine (Sardina pilchardus) in Zone C is not fully exploited. However, the stock structure and abundance should be closely monitored by fishery independent methods, and care must be taken in the management of sardine in Zone C. Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) were both considered fully exploited. In the case of anchovy the Working Group recommends that effort should not exceed current levels whereas for mackerel it was recommended that catches should not exceed 250 000 tonnes. Previous assessments have considered bonga (Ethmalosa fimbriata) as a single stock at the subregional level. However, recent changes in the exploitation of this species in Mauritania with the subsequent large catches make it difficult to assess this species at the subregional level and the group, on a trial basis, proceeded to carry out two separate assessment; Unit North–Northern Mauritania and Unit South-Senegal/The Gambia respectively. The Working Group recommends that effort should not exceed current levels for the northern unit and to decrease the effort on the southern unit...|$|E
40|$|The Cape <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> Trachurus trachurus capensisis one of Namibia's most {{valuable}} fish stocks, {{and an important}} component to the diet of Cape fur seals, Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus, off northern Namibia. The level of overlap in the utilization of this resource between seals and the purse-seine fishery was investigated using two overlap indices. For high overlap measures, seals and the purse-seine fishery utilized age- 2 <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel.</b> For low overlap measures, seals mainly consumed age- 0 fish whereas the fishery caught age- 2 fish. Both indices were adjusted by the proportion of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the seal diet, {{with the assumption that}} the proportion consumed by the seals reflects the abundance of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the coastal waters of Cape Cross, Namibia. Both unadjusted and adjusted overlap indices showed that overlap between seals and the fishery in their utilization of juvenile <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> was high only at times when <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> abundance was high, and low when abundance was small. Confidence intervals and significance testing were included. Overall, there was little overlap between seals and the purse-seine fishery.

40|$|The goal of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> stock {{discrimination}} was tackled {{by integrating}} both established and innovative approaches such as genetic markers (allozymes, mtDNA, microsatellite DNA and SSCP), morphometry and parasites, tagging experiments and life history traits (growth, reproduction and distribution), within the EU-funded HOMSIR project. The sampling covered almost the whole distribution range of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> through 20 sampling localities. 200 fish per sampling site were collected {{taking in consideration}} the spawning season and temporal variation (two years of sampling). The results from genetic approaches (Multilocus Allozyme Electrophoresis, mtDNA and microsatellite DNA) showed {{that there was only}} slight genetic differentiation among sampling sites. Another genetic technique (SSCP), was successful in finding a genetic marker that demonstrated substructuring in <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> populations. Several approaches (SSCP, morphometrics, parasites) support the separation between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea in <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> populations, although the most western Mediterranean area could also be connected with the Atlantic populations. In the Northeast Atlantic, various stocks can be distinguished: The west Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula (southern stock); the west coasts of European countries from northern Spain to Norway (western stock) and the North Sea stock. This information implies the revision of the boundaries of the so-called southern and western stocks as currently defined. Various results suggested that adult <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> could migrate through different areas/or stocks in the Northeast Atlantic. <b>Horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> from the Mauritanian coast is distinguished by its high production parameters (growth and batch fecundity). The population of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the Mediterranean Sea is substructured roughly in at least three main areas: western, central and eastern Mediterranean.

40|$|Purpose. Analysis of {{the main}} {{population}} parameters of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> caught in {{different areas of the}} Black Sea in 2011 - 2013. Methodology. Individuals of the Mediterranean <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus mediterraneus Staindachner, 1868) were caught by bottom traps in the coastal area of Sevastopol, as well as by trawls in areas of the South Coast, Alushta-Sudak, cape Takil from 2011 to 2013. The ichthiological data for Balaklavskaya and Sevastopolskaya (including Peschanaya, Karantinnaya, Alexandrovskaya bays, an open area in front of Karantinnaya and Peschanaya bays) bays were separated.

The Cape <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus trachurus capensis) has {{traditionally}} made {{an important contribution}} to the South African fishing industry and is a key component of the Benguela ecosystem. This thesis concerns the assessment and management of the South African <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> resource. It starts with a brief review of the biology of the Cape <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> and the history of the fishery, {{as well as of the}} Management Strategy Evaluation approach, which was applied in this work. Assessments of the <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> resource are currently undertaken through the combined efforts of the Demersal and Pelagic Scientific Working Groups (SWGs) of the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF). A joint effort is required because the resource is available to multiple fisheries: as directed catch to the midwater trawl fishery and as bycatch to the demersal trawl and pelagic purse-seine fisheries. Management of the resources complicated by differences in the age-structures of the <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> caught in each of these three fisheries. The data available for the assessments are described, including the details of their collection and processing. Four age-structured production models (each reflecting different assumptions about the <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> resource) are fitted to those data using the maximum-likelihood estimation method, and are used to provide assessments. Estimates of the current status of the stock indicate that it is healthy, putting it well above its Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) level. For the directed midwater fishery, MSY is estimated to be in the region of 50 000 - 100 000 tonnes per annum.
