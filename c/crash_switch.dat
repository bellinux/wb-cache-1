40|$|Cloud {{computing}} leverages virtualization {{to offer}} resources on demand to multiple “tenants”. However, sharing the server and network infrastructure creates new vulnerabilities, where one tenant can attack another by compromising the underlying hypervisor. We design {{a system that}} supports virtualized networking using software switches without a hypervisor. In our architecture, the software switch runs in a Switch Domain (DomS) that is separate from the control VM. Both the guest VMs and DomS run directly on the server hardware, with processing and memory resources allocated in advance. Each guest VM interacts with the software switch through a shared memory region using periodic polling to detect network packets. The communication does not involve the hypervisor or the control VM. In addition, any software bugs that <b>crash</b> the software <b>switch</b> do not <b>crash</b> {{the rest of the}} system, and a <b>crashed</b> <b>switch</b> can be easily rebooted. Experiments with our initial prototype, built using Xen and Open vSwitch, show that the combination of shared pages and polling offers reasonable performance compared to conventional hypervisor-based solutions. ...|$|R

50|$|Originally, the {{switching}} tables {{could not}} be altered separately from the main executable code, and topology updates {{had to be made}} by deliberately <b>crashing</b> the <b>switch</b> code and forcing a reboot from the network management center.

Multiple static routes, on a switch-by-switch basis, could be defined for fault tolerance. Network management functions continued to run on Prime minicomputers.|$|R

50|$|The sixth {{version of}} the game also showed {{many of the same}} issues as the '97 version that seemed to {{indicate}} a rushed release or poor quality control. Several of the new issues in the '98 version included a mix-up in the second-half kickoff if the coin-toss winner chose to kick; the game <b>crashing</b> when <b>switching</b> to certain camera angles; and erroneous features like the wrong type of turf in some of the stadiums. Moreover, Sierra Entertainment failed to include a player-ratings editor within the initial release. Three major patches were released during the first month of the game.|$|R
5000|$|On March 10, 2010, the New York Times ran a {{piece by}} Richard Schmidt, PhD, {{professor}} emeritus of psychology at University of California Los Angeles and sudden acceleration researcher, suspecting driver error as {{the primary cause of}} unexplained Toyota sudden acceleration reports. Schmidt pointed to several factors that make driver error more likely: elderly driver age, lack of experience with the car, and short stature. In addition, unexplained sudden acceleration events were most frequently reported as occurring from low speed or fully stopped. Typically, the driver was intending to press the brake, and did not consciously confuse the pedals; however, because of advanced age and neuromuscular irregularities, short stature and difficulty reaching the pedals, a slight misalignment in seating position, or unfamiliarity with the car model, the driver's foot contacted the accelerator by mistake. The resulting unexpected sudden acceleration would lead to panic, with the driver thinking that the acceleration system had failed. The immediate response would be to brake hard, but not knowing that their foot was on the accelerator, pressing down caused greater acceleration. In such panic situations, the driver would think that the brakes were not responding, and continue pressing on the accelerator pedal until they <b>crashed.</b> <b>Switching</b> to neutral or turning off the ignition was typically not contemplated. Incidents occurred exclusively in automatic transmission-equipped cars [...] with driver complaints involving rental cars being far more frequent. All factors point to reduced driver familiarity and sophistication.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{technique}} for sawteeth control in tokamak plasmas using ion-cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) {{has been developed}} in the JET-ILW tokamak [2]. Unlike previous ICRH methods, which explored the destabilization of the internal kink mode when the radiofrequency (RF) wave absorption was placed near the q= 1 surface, the technique presented here consists of stabilizing the sawteeth {{as fast as possible}} by applying the ICRH power centrally and inducing a sawtooth <b>crash</b> by <b>switching</b> it off at the appropriate instant. Since it employs on-axis ICRH, this technique is aligned with other ICRH applications that require central plasma heating such as high-Z impurity control and fusion power enhancement. The validation of this method in JET-ILW L-mode discharges is presented...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{evolution}} of the S&P 500 returns volatility around market crashes using a Markov-Switching model. We find that volatility typically switches into the high volatility state well before a crash and remains in the high state for a considerable period of time after the crash. These results do not support the view that crashes are due to the resolution of uncertainty (e. g. Romer, 1993), but are consistent with the model in Frankel (2008) where the adaptive forecasts of volatility by uniformed traders result in a crash.

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis {{highlights the importance}} of market crashes and the subsequent market illiquidity for optimal portfolio selection. We propose a tractable and flexible portfolio choice model where market <b>crashes</b> can trigger <b>switching</b> into another regime with a different investment opportunity set. We characterize the optimal trading strategy in terms of coupled integro-differential equations and develop a quite general iterative numerical solution procedure. We conduct an extensive analysis of the optimal trading strategy. In contrast to standard portfolio choice models, changes in the investment opportunity set in one regime can affect the optimal trading strategy in another regime {{even in the absence of}} transaction costs. In addition, an increase in the expected jump size can increase stock investment even when the expected return remains the same and the volatility increases. Moreover, we show that misestimating the correlation between market crashes and market illiquidity can be costly to investors.

5000|$|The DN5 {{proved to}} be a fast car, which {{qualified}} well several times. In fact, for the first race of the season, the Argentine Grand Prix, Jarier, the team leader qualified the DN5 on pole. [...] However, on race day, the car failed to complete the warmup lap due to a crown wheel and pinion failure in the gearbox. [...] Jarier took pole again for the following Brazilian Grand Prix, but retired on lap 32, having led for most of the race (and achieving fastest lap). Ultimately, the poor reliability of the car (and some driver induced errors) meant that Jarier finished only two races during the season. [...] The best of these was fourth at the Spanish Grand Prix, for which he was awarded half points due to the race being stopped {{as a result of a}} bad <b>crash.</b> He also <b>switched</b> to a Matra V12 powered DN7 for two races towards the end of the season.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — To {{guarantee}} the connectivity in wireless networks {{is an important}} issue. For this purpose, we have to provide precise frequency for the network such that it can meet the various require-ments of future applications. In this paper, we not only propose a novel frequency calibration methodology based on SVM-based fuzzy inference system (SVM-FIS) in wireless networks, but also against temporary failure of wireless connection. There are two modes—normal mode and handover mode—in the calibration system. In normal mode, the primary clock can periodically delivers the controlling signals to steer the remote station’s oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO) through the wireless connection. Once the wireless connection was temporarily <b>crashed,</b> the station <b>switches</b> to holdover mode which the SVM-FIS controller takes over sending the control-ling signals from primary clock to steer its OCXO. Experimental results indicate that performance of frequency stability of the OCXO can be improved from a few parts in 109 to 1013 for averaging times of one day, and the performance can be maintained within a few parts in 1012 over a day in holdover mode...|$|R
40|$|Background. Road traffic crashes are {{considered}} by the WHO {{to be the most}} important global cause of death from injury. However, this may not be true for large areas of rural Asia where road vehicles are uncommon. The issue is important, since emphasising the importance of road traffic <b>crashes</b> risks <b>switching</b> resources to urban areas, away from already underfunded rural regions. In this study, we compared the importance of road traffic crashes with other forms of injury in a poor rural region of South Asia. Methodology/Principal Findings. We collected data on all deaths from injury in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka (NCP; population 1, 105, 198 at 2001 census) over 18 months using coronial, hospital, and police data. We calculated the incidence of death from all forms of intentional and unintentional injury in the province. The annual incidence of death from injury in the province was high: 84. 2 per 100, 000 population. Half of the deaths were from self-harm (41. 3 / 100, 000). Poisoning (35. 7 / 100, 000) —in particular, pesticide self-poisoning (23. 7 / 100, 000) —was the most common cause of death, being 3. 9 -fold more common than road traffic crashes (9. 1 / 100, 000). Conclusions/Significance. In poor rural regions of South Asia, fatal self-harm and pesticide self-poisoning in particular are significantly more important than road traffic injuries as a cause of death. It is possible that the data used by the WHO to calculate global injury estimates are biased towards urban areas with better data collection but little pesticide poisoning. More studies are required to inform a debate about the importance of different forms of injury and how avoidable deaths from any cause can be prevented. In the meantime, marked improvement...|$|R
40|$|Software-defined {{networking}} (SDN) offers {{greater flexibility}} than traditional distributed architectures, {{at the risk}} of the controller be-ing a single point-of-failure. Unfortunately, existing fault-tolerance techniques, such as replicated state machine, are insufficient to en-sure correct network behavior under controller failures. The chal-lenge is that, in addition to the application state of the controllers, the switches maintain hard state that must be handled consistently. Thus, it is necessary to incorporate switch state into the system model to correctly offer a “logically centralized ” controller. We introduce Ravana, a fault-tolerant SDN controller platform that processes the control messages transactionally and exactly once (at both the controllers and the switches). Ravana maintains these guarantees in the face of both controller and <b>switch</b> <b>crashes.</b> The key insight in Ravana is that replicated state machines can be ex-tended with lightweight switch-side mechanisms to guarantee cor-rectness, without involving the switches in an elaborate consensus protocol. Our prototype implementation of Ravana enables unmod-ified controller applications to execute in a fault-tolerant fashion. Experiments show that Ravana achieves high throughput with rea-sonable overhead, compared to a single controller, with a failover time under 100 ms. ...|$|R

5000|$|Mast ran {{thirteen}} {{races for}} Mach 1 Racing in 1989, finishing sixth at the Daytona 500 in an unsponsored car, which Mast called his proudest achievement in racing. He still believes {{he would have}} won had his team been willing to gamble on fuel mileage. Mast ran selected races in 1990 for D.K. Ulrich before finishing the year with Travis Carter Motorsports. In 1991, Mast signed to drive the No. 1 Skoal Classic-sponsored Oldsmobile for Richard Jackson's Precision Products Racing. He started out the season by leading fourteen laps in the Daytona 500 and finished fourth. He had three top-tens and finished 21st in points. That year, the Talladega Superspeedway produced a couple of highlights for Mast. In the Winston 500, he pushed a fuel-deficient Harry Gant (driving for Leo Jackson, Richard's brother) during the final lap of the race, helping Gant win (Mast was one lap down in tenth). This action is prohibited after the white flag by NASCAR rules, regardless of who the individual drivers are, {{but he was not}} fined money or points. With less than 25 laps to go in the DieHard 500, Mast was tapped by Buddy Baker entering the tri-oval and flipped over. He slid to a stop a few hundred feet beyond the start-finish line and soon climbed out of the car, much to the delight of the crowd. He was not injured, but half-jokingly said afterwards, [...] "I'm okay but I need another pair of underwear". The next year, Mast won his first career Cup pole at the final race of the 1992 season, the 1992 Hooters 500, which was Richard Petty's final race, Jeff Gordon's first race, and the day that Alan Kulwicki won the championship by one race position over Bill Elliott. Mast's race ended on the first lap in a <b>crash.</b> The team <b>switched</b> to Ford in 1993. Mast had a career year in 1994, with ten top-ten finishes and a career-high-tying eighteenth, finishing a career-best second at Rockingham Speedway, a race where he slid sideways while racing side-by-side with winner Dale Earnhardt coming out of the final corner. In August of that season, he won the pole position at the inaugural Brickyard 400 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (a race for which 90 cars were entered), finishing eighteenth in points. In comparison, 1995 was disappointing for Mast, with only three top-tens. Skoal left {{at the end of the}} season, and Hooters replaced them, as the team switched to Pontiac. He had three top-tens late in the year, but when the season came to a close, he and Hooters left PPR.|$|R
