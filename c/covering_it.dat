5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), <b>covering</b> <b>it</b> with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously <b>covering</b> <b>it</b> with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E
5|$|In the Period II, the finds {{excavated}} {{revealed that}} people had moved out from pit dwelling to structures built at the ground level. However, the pits and its associated chambers formed the base floor of the superstructure, which was made up by filling the pits and <b>covering</b> <b>it</b> with mud plaster, and occasionally painted in red ochre. Post-holes around the pits revealed that the superstructures were made of wood built over compacted Karewa soil floors.|$|E

5|$|As the {{consultant}} {{talks with the}} residents of the town and investigates its history, the backstory of his injury is gradually revealed. After repeatedly stubbing his toe and <b>covering</b> <b>it</b> up with Apex bandages, {{the consultant}} accidentally stepped into pig feces during a company team retreat. Because of the colored bandage, he never discovered how his toe was badly infected, and fainted on the sidewalk after fleeing from an awards party.

5|$|Operation Kugown was {{the name}} given to the {{psychological}} warfare operation that had played {{an important part in}} the overthrow of Árbenz. During the coup, its primary targets had been the Árbenz government. After the conclusion of the coup, Kugown continued, targeting the rest of Guatemala, and the wider international audience. The aim of the operation was to disseminate derogatory information about Árbenz, and to convince Guatemalans—and the rest of the world—that Árbenz's regime had been communist-dominated. The use of documents from PBHistory for Operation Kugown began in August 1954. The standard method employed by the CIA was to select a document that could be portrayed as incriminating and write an explanation <b>covering</b> <b>it.</b> This would then be released to the press by the Comite, so that the local agency could receive some credit. The Comite also released a short documentary film, titled Despues Descubrimos La Verdad ("Later We Discover the Truth"). Through these avenues news media in Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America were saturated with stories of how the Árbenz government had been controlled by communists.|$|E

Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E

5|$|As {{the storm}} moved northward over the Yellow Sea, {{atmospheric}} conditions became increasingly hostile, with significantly lower sea surface temperatures and high wind shear. During the overnight of August2728, the typhoon brushed South Korea as a weakening cyclone. Convection {{on the west}} side of the storm diminished and its feeder bands began to collapse. Increasing shear started taking its toll early on August28 as convection became displaced from the center of circulation, leaving part of the southwestern quadrant exposed. This also indicated that Bolaven had begun to undergo an extratropical transition as it approached the Korean Peninsula. Following structural weakening, the JMA and JTWC downgraded Bolaven to a severe tropical storm and tropical storm, respectively. Hours before moving onshore in North Korea, the majority of the convection had moved over land while the circulation and the center itself had only stratocumulus clouds <b>covering</b> <b>it.</b> Around 1500UTC on August28, Bolaven made landfall in North Korea with winds of 100km/h (65mph). Rapidly moving towards the northeast, the storm became fully embedded within a baroclinic zone near the ChinaNorth Korea border later that day. The JMA continued to monitor Bolaven as a tropical cyclone until early on August29, at which time the system was situated over the southern region of the Russian Far East. The extratropical remnants later turned eastward and were last noted on September1 crossing the International Dateline.|$|E
