40|$|Abstract This thesis {{describes}} {{the application of}} Low Coherence Interferometry (LCI) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) in paper measurements. The developed measurement system {{is a combination of}} a profilometer and a tomographic imaging device, which makes the construction versatile and applicable in several paper measurement applications. The developed system was first used to measure the surface structure of paper. Different grades of paper were selected to provide maximum variation in surface structure. The results show that the developed system is capable of measuring grades of paper from rough base <b>paper</b> to highly <b>coated</b> <b>photo</b> printing <b>paper.</b> To evaluate the developed system in surface characterization, the roughness parameters of five laboratory-made paper samples measured with the developed system and with a commercial optical profilometer were compared. A linear correlation was found with roughness parameters Ra and Rq. Next, the surface quality of paper was evaluated using LCI, a Diffractive Optical Element Based Glossmeter (DOG), and a commercial glossmeter. The results show linear correlation between Ra and gloss measured with the commercial glossmeter. The roughness Ra and averaged gloss measured with the DOG didn't give such a correlation, but a combination of these techniques provided local properties of gloss and surface structure, which can be used to evaluate the local surface properties of paper. In the next study, determination of the filler content of paper using OCT is discussed. The measurement results show clear correspondence of the slope of the averaged logarithmic fringe signal envelope and the filler content. The last studies focus on 2 D and 3 D imaging of paper using OCT and begin with imaging of a self-made wood fiber network. The visibility of the fibers was clear. Next, several refractive index matcing agents are studied by means of light transmittance and OCT measurements to find the best possible agent for enhancing the imaging depth of OCT in paper. Benzyl alcohol was found to have the best possible combination of optical, evaporation, and sorption characteristics, and it is applied in 2 D and 3 D visualizations of copy paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{provides}} a novel post treatment method to achieve high conductivity of nano-size silver coatings. Based on {{the preparation of}} nano-size conductive ink and conductive circuit, the printed sample and the coated conductive film were treated by series concentrations of silver nitrate solution and hydrazine hydrate solution in this order. The samples were dipped in 1 %~ 20 % solutions of silver nitrate and hydrazine hydrate successively, to form the new conductive layer of Ag particles only. It was investigated {{that the relationship between}} the thickness of printed and <b>coated</b> layers on <b>photo</b> <b>paper</b> and final conductivity after dipped in two kinds of solutions in turn, which were printed from one to three times and coated by screw (6 #). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to characterize the morphologies of as printed and coated samples. The surface sheet resistance of sample was tested by four-probe tester. It was found that when the coated silver conductive ink samples were dipped in 2 % silver nitrate solutions and 2 % hydrazine hydrate solution at room temperature, the conductivity reaches 0. 82 Ω/□. The samples with thicker conductive film before dipping need solutions at lower concentration to get high conductivity. The roughness of samples after treatment falls down, as the concentrate of dipping solutions rising. It is therefore considered that the “dip in ” method {{provides a}}n efficient alternative to improve the conductivity of samples...|$|R
50|$|Glossy <b>photo</b> <b>paper,</b> {{generally}} the most popular, has a shiny finish that gives photos a vivid look. It is generally smooth {{to the touch}} and has some glare. Matte <b>photo</b> <b>paper</b> is less shiny, and produces superior text results. Matte and glossy prints typically feel different to the touch, but when displayed under glass they often look similar. Papers with an imitation canvas texture emulate the look of oil paintings. <b>Photo</b> <b>papers</b> are usually high-brightness, neutral white papers, but off-white papers are available.|$|R
