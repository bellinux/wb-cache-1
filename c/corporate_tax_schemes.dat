40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate on alternative <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>schemes,</b> employing a rigorous real option methodology which has never been used to study both liquidation policy and taxation. Different tax systems are considered, according to whether the tax regime is progressive or flat and losses are deductible or not. The critical liquidation threshold is derived {{as a function of}} interest expenses, the firmÕs driving parameters and the tax rates and taxation brackets. It is shown that only the adoption of a flat tax plan does not interfere with the firmÕs liquidation policy, while any progressive tax schedule can slow down or speed up the closure policy.

40|$|Alternative {{corporate}} tax systems {{differ in their}} ability to adapt to changes in the rate of inflation. Absent complete indexing of depreciation allowances, a tax system may use the expected inflation rate to set accelerated depreciation allowances in a way that minimizes the welfare loss from them is allocation of capital. This welfare loss is a nonlinear function of the assumed inflation rate, however, so the welfare loss at the expected inflation rate may be quite different from the expected welfare loss. We compute these two welfare concepts for each of three alternative <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>schemes</b> in the U. S. and for two different relationships between inflation and interest rates. One important finding is that the Auerbach-Jorgenson first year recovery plan is not equivalent to indexing as is often claimed, if uncertainty about inflation implies uncertainty about the real after-tax discount rate. ...|$|E
30|$|Secondly, in {{our study}} we have focused on {{corporate}} income taxes generated by parent companies located in Spain. We are aware that these companies typically constitute a group of companies (i.e. parent or principal and subsidiaries) with operations in different tax settings. Consequently, the impact of taxes on their debt policies might be lower than the actual obtained {{in the present study}} because these companies can shift profits into low-tax jurisdictions. One of the main implications of this is that the marginal tax rate should be estimated on a group of companies basis instead of an individual one. What is more, it would be necessary to consider the specific <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> <b>schemes</b> in each of the countries where the corporate group operates. The inclusion of international corporate taxation goes beyond the scope of our study, and this subject should be subject to future research.|$|E

40|$|This thesis assesses two {{different}} sub-fields inside public economics {{in general and}} taxation in particular: tax incidence and tax competition. The first chapter analyzes the incidence of taxes in the Canadian retail gasoline market by devising a novel empirical test, based on observables, to assess whether taxes are under- or overshifted in an oligopolistic market. The results show that taxes in the Canadian retail gasoline market are undershifted. The second one focuses on the tax competition among Swiss cantons by empirically assessing the impact of introducing a <b>corporate</b> flat <b>tax</b> <b>scheme</b> on <b>corporate</b> location decisions. The main finding shows that switching from a graduated rate <b>tax</b> (GRT) <b>scheme</b> on profits to a flat rate tax (FRT) system has a negative (rather small) impact on the stock of firms in Swiss municipalities (and cantons).

A number of hypotheses are tested concerning heterogeneity in the impact of effective <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rates on the size distributions of firms with regard to firm size class, industry and time. The results are based on data covering the whole Swedish economy for the period 1973 - 2002. The descriptive results suggest that effective <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rates differ by firm size, industry and over time. Application of t-tests demonstrate inequality in mean and variance of effective <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rates between major size classes but not within major size classes: smaller firms report a higher effective <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rate than larger firms. The t-tests also demonstrate inequality in mean and variance of effective <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rates between industrial sectors: service sector reports a higher effective <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rate than production sector. The regressions show effective <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rates to have: {{a negative effect on}} the size distribution of large firms, negative effect on transportation, financing and service sector and a positive effect on manufacturing, electricity and on production sector.

40|$|The {{effects on}} trade {{performance}} of <b>corporate</b> <b>taxes</b> and the value-added tax (VAT) continue to excite controversy but have received little empirical attention. This paper uses panel data for OECD countries from 1967 to 2003 {{to examine the effects}} of these taxes on export performance, paying particular attention to the potentially complex dynamic effects to which theory points. It finds that increased reliance on VAT revenue tends to be associated with a sharp reduction in net exports, which quickly fades. This may reflect unrelated movements in consumption, and our preferred specifications point to no trade effects of the VAT in either the short or the long run. Our results also point, however, to powerful and complex effects from the <b>corporate</b> <b>tax,</b> the pattern of which is as theory would predict from a source-based tax of this kind. Increases in corporate taxation-whether measured by revenues or the statutory rate-are associated with sharp short-run increases in net exports (consistent with induced capital flows abroad); these are then subsequently and quickly reversed (consistent with increased income from investments abroad), leaving an increase in net exports that converges to zero.

40|$|Recently, {{discussion}} of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> reduction is hot political issue in Japan. Especially, some researchers and politicians {{insist on the}} reduction of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rate, following the fact of "Corporate tax paradox", which means that <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> revenue per Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has a negative correlation with effective <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rate. However, quantitative effect of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> reduction is unclear and the {{discussion of}} finance methods does not proceed. Therefore, we examine the quantitative effect of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> reduction to employment, output and total tax revenue which {{is the cost of}} tax reduction. To analyze the effect of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> reduction, we use Dynamic General Equilibrium (DGE) model and we use shooting algorithm to calculate the large <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> reduction (i. e. 5 % or 20 % <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rate reduction). As a result, long-run effect of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> reduction not only prompts to economic growth, but also increases total tax revenue, when financed by lump-sum transfer. Because current <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rate is the right hand side of the Laffer curve. With respect to the magnitude of tax reduction, absolute impact of 20 % reduction is much larger than that of 5 %. But relative impact (i. e. multiplier effect of tax reduction) of 20 % reduction is a little smaller than that of 5 %. However, short-run effect is smaller than long-run one. In the short-run, since capital accumulation is insufficient, households decrease consumption and tax revenue. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Over {{the past}} two decades there has been a {{worldwide}} fall in statutory <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rates. Focusing on Australia, this article establishes three empirical facts which challenge much of the existing literature. First, <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> competition was the crucial driving force behind <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> cuts. Second, policymakers had to abandon tax related investment incentives in order to pay for lower <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rates. This broadening of the <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> base is costly, because it potentially disadvantages domestic firms and may, over the longer term, erode the <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> base. Third, <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> cuts have put pressure on the personal income tax base, as low <b>corporate</b> rates provide <b>tax</b> avoidance opportunities for high-income earners.

However, relatively high marginal and average effective tax rates prompt the question of whether adjustments should be considered to meet the objectives of promoting growth, investment and competitiveness in a revenue neutral manner. This paper discusses key issues and trade-off''s related to changes in the <b>corporate</b> income <b>tax</b> system. It does not provide recommendations, but raises issues that could hopefully serve as useful inputs to the ongoing discussion and tax debate in Japan.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the pros and}} cons of using a carbon tax to help finance <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> reform. Revenues from a plausible carbon tax would be large relative to <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> revenues and could thus help finance lower <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rates, extension of business tax preferences, or other <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> reforms. Done well, such a tax swap could reduce the environmental risks of carbon emissions and improve the efficiency of America’s <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> system. But a carbon-for-corporate tax swap poses a significant distributional challenge. A carbon tax would fall disproportionately on low-income families, while a reduction in <b>corporate</b> <b>taxes</b> would disproportionately benefit those with high incomes. Policymakers can offset some of those impacts through other policy measures, such as paying lump-sum tax rebates. But doing so would reduce the swap’s efficiency benefits. Policymakers may also want to use some carbon revenues for deficit reduction. One option would be to aim for revenue neutrality over an initial period, after which a widening spread between growing carbon revenues and relatively stable <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> cuts would reduce the deficit...|$|R
