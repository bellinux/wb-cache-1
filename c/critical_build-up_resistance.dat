40|$|Botrytis cinerea {{is able to}} <b>build-up</b> <b>resistance</b> to pyrrolnitrin, an {{antibiotic}} produced by diverse biocontrol agents, possibly compromising the durability of this method of disease control. The development of two near-isogenic lines of B. cinerea differing in their level of resistance to pyrrolnitrin was compared in tomato plants and on PDA medium. In tomato plants, {{significant differences in the}} percentage of infected petioles one day after inoculation and in symptom progression on petioles and stems were observed between the resistant mutant and the sensitive wild-type parent suggesting a difference in their level of aggressiveness. Cytohistological investigations revealed that conidia of both near-isogenic lines germinated 6 hours after inoculation and mycelium developed within petiole tissues 12 hours after inoculation. However, while the wild-type parent isolate spread throughout the petiole and rapidly invaded the stem tissues via the leaf-abscission zone 72 hours after inoculation, the pyrrolnitrin-resistant mutant failed to extend beyond petiole tissues to invade the stem. Moreover, 72 hours after inoculation, the mycelial development of the pyrrolnitrin-resistant mutant was accompanied by abnormal glycogen accumulation and chlamydospore-like cells formation. In contrast, wild-type parent mycelium was normally structured with intensive colonization of stem tissues. Additionally, on PDA medium the mycelium of the pyrrolnitrin-resistant mutant was less vigorous than the wild-type isolate. These results suggest that the acquisition of pyrrolnitrin-resistance in B. cinerea is accompanied by changes in mycelial structure and reduction in mycelial growth, leading to a noticeable loss of aggressiveness on tomato plant...|$|R

40|$|Injection {{of fluid}} waste into Precambrian {{crystalline}} {{rocks at the}} Rocky Mountain Arsenal triggered earthquakes in the 1960 s. Available {{data suggest that the}} waste fluid was injected into a reservoir composed of connected vertical fractures. Earthquakes are believed to be results of lateral sliding motions along fracture planes. A mathematical model is constructed to simulate fluid pressure build-up caused by injection. Computed pressure build-up is related to the spatial distribution of earthquake epicenters. The results show that the earthquakes are confined to that part of the reservoir where the pressure build-up exceeds 32 bars. This critical value is interpreted as the pressure build-up above which earthquakes occur. The existence of this critical pressure is consistent with the Hubbert-Rubey theory on the role of fluid pressure in fault movement. The migration of earthquake epicenters away from the injection well, a phenomenon noted by previous investigators, can be accounted for by the outward propagation of the <b>critical</b> pressure <b>build-up.</b> The analysis is extended to examining the effects of fracture widening under high injection pressure.

These plant varieties carry a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki, Bt, that makes the plant produce a toxin deadly to the pest insect European Corn Borer (ECB) Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner). Since ECB may build up genetic resistance to this toxin, the growers of transgenic corn varieties are required to plant {{a portion of their}} field (refuge) with regular corn. This requirement is expected to prolong the efficiency of Bt corn in combating the ECB because some non-resistant pests can survive in the refuge, and thereby dilute the <b>build-up</b> of <b>resistance</b> in the overall pest population. A fixed refuge size of 20 percent is the currently recommended "rule-of-thumb" by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The objective of this work is to fine-tune parametric refuge specifications by formulating a bioeconomic model capable of endogenously determining the optimal trajectory of refuge sizes over time via an analytical optimal-control rule.

40|$|BACKGROUND Black leaf streak disease (BLSD) is {{the most}} {{important}} disease of bananas for export. The successful control of BLSD requires an intensive use of systemic fungicides, leading to the <b>build-up</b> of <b>resistance</b> and failure of control. Early detection of fungicide resistance is crucial to drive rational chemical strategies. Present methods relying on ascospore germination bioassays have several drawbacks that could be overcome using conidia. RESULTS Generally, a single genotype is present on the conidial population derived from one lesion. Conidial germination tests with thiabendazole (5 ?mg?L? 1) enable a clear detection of strains resistant to methyl benzimidazole carbamates. Germination bioassays on azoxystrobin (10 ?mg?L? 1) enable the detection of most QoI-resistant strains, but their proportion might be underestimated with cut-off limits of germ tube length (L > 120 ?µm) or growth inhibition (GI < 50 %). The level of fungicide resistance differs at different canopy levels of a banana tree, which should be considered for sampling. The ascospore germination bioassay provided more variable estimations of the level of resistance by comparison with the new conidial germination bioassay. CONCLUSION Germination bioassays performed with conidia obtained from young lesions overcome most drawbacks encountered with ascospore germination bioassays and could be considered as a new reference method for fungicide resistance monitoring in this species. Different steps are proposed, from sampling to microscopic examinations, for the implementation of this technique. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} develop a {{resistance}} management strategy to control tropical pests based on the co-expression of different toxins, a fully modified Bacillus thuringiensis cry 1 B gene and the translational fusion cry 1 B-cry 1 Ab gene have been developed. Both constructs were cloned {{under the control of}} a maize ubiquitin- 1 or a rice actin- 1 promoter and linked to the bar gene driven by the CaMV 35 S promoter. Immature embryos from the tropical lines CML 72, CML 216, and their hybrids, were used as the target for transformation by microprojectile bombardment. Twenty five percent of the transformed maize plants with cry 1 B expressed a protein that is active against southwestern corn borer and sugarcane borer.

40|$|Singapore is a {{small island}} state and its {{development}} of commercial aquaculture started only in the early 1970 s. The foodfish aquaculture industry currently produces about 4 % of the estimated 100, 000 mt of fish consumed annually. The main bulk of foodfish production comes from marine coastal farms and some from land-based foodfish farms. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) is the national authority for aquaculture development for Singapore and manages aquaculture farms through the issuance of farm licenses. For marine foodfish farms, the farm licensee has to abide by good farm management guidelines to maintain the farm in good condition and ensure that the farm does not engage in activities that would pollute the farm waters. For land-based farms, there are also guidelines that address infrastructure layout, farming system and water treatment facilities. The latter requires that sedimentation ponds, reservoir ponds/tanks, supply and drainage systems, trade effluent treatment and sampling plant {{are included in the}} farm set-up. Aquaculture, as with all other food production practices, is facing challenges for sustainable development. An example of Singapore s contribution to sustainable aquaculture is through the development of technology for consistent and economical mass production of fish seeds under controlled conditions. This approach will alleviate the pressure on nature to provide the seeds for farming and would make available large numbers of quality fish for small and large-scale commercial aquaculture. AVA has established the Marine Aquaculture Centre (MAC) at St. John's Island {{to address the needs of}} aquaculture development for Singapore through fish reproduction and seed production technology development as well as large- scale fish farming technology development. At present, the fish reproduction technology research work involves closing the reproductive cycles of key marine food fish species and also fry production at a commercial scale. Closing the reproductive cycles will eliminate the reliance and alleviate the pressure on wild seed stock. Good quality brooders are selected, maintained and bred to produce quality fry, which would indirectly translate to better growth performances and shorter culture period. This, together with good farm management practices, will optimize the usage offish feeds during the culture cycle. AVA is looking into the use of vaccination for fish health management purpose, to reduce the reliance on prophylactic drugs in the future. Antibiotics or chemicals if not administered properly for treatment may have negative consequences. One of them is the presence of drug residues in aquatic products which has food safety and health concerns. Other issues include adverse effects on the environment such as <b>build-up</b> <b>resistance</b> of pathogens. In the past, the focus of attention in aquaculture management had been on increasing yield by culture practices, with a view to short-term economic viability. With the current rate of depleting marine resources, there is an urgent need to develop aquaculture in a sustainable way. Current efforts and future developments such as implementation of surveillance programmes, personnel training, fish nutrition and feeding, fish health, the establishment of good aquaculture practices, monitoring of the fish farming environment seawater re-use and information sharing will facilitate working towards the development of sustainable aquaculture in Singapore...|$|R

40|$|Background : To {{successfully}} eliminate malaria, {{an integrated}} system {{that includes a}} number of approaches and interventions-aimed at overcoming the threat of antimalarial drug resistance-is required. Significant {{progress has been made}} in reducing malaria incidence through large-scale use of artemisinin-based combination therapies and insecticide-treated nets. To consolidate these gains, attention should be paid to the missing links in the elimination of malaria. One of these gaps is the residual reservoir of submicroscopic resistant parasites, which remains after case management or other control measures have been carried out. Therefore, the present opinion piece highlights the importance of exploring the role that submicroscopic resistant parasites could play in hindering malaria elimination by allowing the persistence of transmission, particularly in areas of low transmission or in the pre-elimination and/or elimination phase. Discussion : If malaria elimination interventions are to be effective, the relative role of the hidden reservoir of resistant parasites needs to be assessed, particularly in regions that are low-transmission settings and/or in pre-elimination and/or elimination phases. Various ongoing studies are focusing on the role of submicroscopic malaria infections in malaria transmission but overlook the possible <b>build-up</b> of <b>resistance</b> to antimalarial drugs among submicroscopic parasite populations. This is an important factor as it may eventually limit the effectiveness of malaria elimination strategies. Conclusions : An evidence-based estimation of the "true" reservoir of resistant parasites can help target the existing and emerging foci of resistant parasites before they spread.

Sporangial and zoosporangial progeny from the parent and from some sexual progeny were also assessed. The different isolates were grown on Rye B Agar amended with different concentrations of one of five different fungicides: Metalaxyl, Propamocarb hydrochloride, Cymoxanil, Fluazinam and Azoxystrobin. The results indicated that in metalaxyl, the sensitivity of sporangial progeny {{was similar to that}} of the parent isolates, however that of zoosporangial progeny ranged from being Intermediate (MI) to being Resistant (MR) if the parents were Resistant (MR) or from Sensitive (MS) to being Intermediate (MI) if the parents were Sensitive (MS).

With the other fungicides, there was a variation in the sensitivity of sporangial and zoosporangial progeny e. g. some sensitive sporangia gave rise to highly resistant zoospores. The results showed that resistance to the most commonly used fungicides against late blight is possible. Although no resistance to the new fungicide azoxystrobin was observed, the appearance of resistance to it among other fungal pathogens has been reported.

40|$|The {{burden of}} {{foodborne}} disease has large {{economic and social}} consequences worldwide. Despite strict regulations, a number of pathogens persist within the food environment, which is greatly contributed to by a <b>build-up</b> of <b>resistance</b> mechanisms and also through the formation of biofilms. Biofilms {{have been shown to}} be highly resistant to a number of antimicrobials and can be extremely difficult to remove once they are established. In parallel, the growing concern of consumers regarding the use of chemically derived antimicrobials within food has led to a drive toward more natural products. As a consequence, the use of naturally derived antimicrobials has become of particular interest. In this study we investigated the efficacy of nisin A and its bioengineered derivative M 21 A in combination with food grade additives to treat biofilms of a representative foodborne disease isolate of Listeria monocytogenes. Investigations revealed the enhanced antimicrobial effects, in liquid culture, of M 21 A in combination with citric acid or cinnamaldehyde over its wild type nisin A counterpart. Subsequently, an investigation was conducted into the effects of these combinations on an established biofilm of the same strain. Nisin M 21 A (0. 1 μg/ml) alone or in combination with cinnamaldehyde (35 μg/ml) or citric acid (175 μg/ml) performed significantly better than combinations involving nisin A. All combinations of M 21 A with either citric acid or cinnamaldehyde eradicated the L. monocytogenes biofilm (in relation to a non-biofilm control). We conclude that M 21 A in combination with available food additives could further enhance the antimicrobial treatment of biofilms within the food industry, simply by substituting nisin A with M 21 A in current commercial products such as Nisaplin® (Danisco, DuPont) ...|$|R

The lack of new antibiotic discoveries and the <b>build-up</b> of <b>resistance</b> towards existing antibiotics, particularly in biofi lms, are proving a major global challenge to infection control and causing high mortality rates, which is exacerbated by the contamination of implant surfaces. The chemical modifi cation of implants {{has proved to be}} very promising in preventing bacterial attachment over the past few decades, but despite the huge consequential reduction in bacterial attachment rates, no solution yet exists for preventing the attachment of bacteria and the subsequent formation of biofi lms; it is generally recognised in the fi eld of biomaterials surface science {{that it is possible to}} change the rate but not the fate of biofi lm formation. This chapter provides an overview of the state of the art in the fi eld of manufacture of chemically modifi ed surfaces that are produced in an effort to minimise the formation of biofi lms. A summary of the role of adsorbed biomolecules present in the environment surrounding implants is provided. This is an additional complicating factor, since we hypothesise that preventing biomolecular adsorption onto the surface of implants is needed to resolve the issue of implant-centred infection. Such an outcome therefore requires the development of novel surface modifi cation strategies and perhaps more than one concept to improve the effectiveness of a coating. In this respect we summarise techniques such as the use of hydrophilic polymer layers and plasma polymers, selfcleaning surfaces, and combinations of controlled release of bactericidal molecules. In addition, we propose other novel antibacterial surface modifi cation strategies. We also highlight that preventing the initial attachment of bacteria is a fundamental requirement in preventing biofi lm formation, since a biofi lm can form once a single bacterium has attached to a substrate surface...|$|R

Despite this potential role, very {{little is known about}} its changes during ontogeny. Here, conduit tapering and stem morphology of young/small and old/tall individuals of Acer pseudoplatanus in the field, as well as 3 -yr-old grafted trees from both age classes, were analysed. The distribution of hydraulic resistance along stems was also determined in a subsample of trees. Substantial conduit tapering was found in small trees (field-grown and grafted from both age classes), whereas values were lower in tall trees, indicating that tapering was a size-related, not an age-related process. Apical conduit diameters were larger in tall trees and were inversely correlated with the degree of tapering. Hydraulic resistance increased less than linearly with distance from the apex. Its scaling against distance was indistinguishable from that predicted from anatomical measurements. Conduit tapering was an effective but partial mechanism of compensation for the increase in hydraulic resistance with tree height. Size-related changes in tapering and in apical conduit diameters may be explained by the combined need to reduce the <b>build-up</b> of hydraulic <b>resistance</b> while minimizing the carbon costs of building vessel walls...|$|R

Furthermore, to study the coverage rate of therapy and therapy failure in relation to the transmission of resistant viruses a mathematical model was developed. The reverse transcriptase and protease genes of viruses were analysed in newly infected people in the period 1990 - 1998 in the Amsterdam Cohort Study on HIV infection and AIDS in homosexual men. The mathematical model was based on the coverage of drug regimens selecting zidovudine (ZDV) resistance, the lag time in which resistance is gained or lost, the death rate of people infected with resistant virus, and the replacement of resistance-selecting regimens by more potent treatments that substantially reduce viral load and mortality. Of 43 individuals with a primary HIV-infection, three (7 %) harboured ZDV-resistant viruses. The first of the ZDV-resistant strains was transmitted in 1995, the last two in 1996. The <b>build-up</b> of ZDV <b>resistance</b> was described by the mathematical model indicating that the equilibrium level of resistance due to treatment depends only on the treatment rate and the outflow rate of patients with resistance virus. Our model indicates that the frequency of viral resistance in a population is determined largely by the number of individuals on insufficient or failing therapy and is influenced only modestly by secondary transmission of ZDV-resistant strain...|$|R
40|$|Chrysophtharta agricola (Chapuis) is a pest of {{commercial}} eucalypt plantations in Tasmania and Victoria. Vagility of pest populations {{may result in}} difficulty predicting temporal and spatial pest outbreaks, and influence genetic resistance to chemical control. Gene flow in this pest species was estimated to assess predicability of attack, the potential efficacy of natural enemies, {{and the likelihood of}} <b>resistance</b> <b>build-up.</b> Ten geographic populations of C. agricola (six from Tasmania, one from the Australian Capital Territory, one from New South Wales and two from Victoria) were examined for genetic variation and gene flow using cellulose acetate allozyme electrophoresis. Six enzyme systems (PGI, PGD, PGM, IDH, HEX and MPI) were consistently polymorphic and scorable and were used to quantify estimated gene flow between populations. FST values and analysis of molecular variance indicated that gene flow was restricted between populations. Chrysophtharta agricola exhibited high levels of heterozygosity, probably because of high allelic diversity, and because all loci examined were polymorphic. The southern-most population was the most genetically different to other Tasmanian populations, and may also have been the most recently colonized. Limited gene flow implies that outbreaks of C. agricola should be spatially predictable and populations susceptible to control by natural enemies. Our results also imply that genetic resistance to chemical control may occur under frequent application of insecticide. However, testing population movement between plantations and native forest also needs to be conducted to assess gene flow between forest types...|$|R
40|$|Limited {{information}} of fungicide efficacy on cultivated mushrooms and resistance development potential is available. Minor crop industries in general have a smaller arsenal of protectants {{to rely on}} {{and the likelihood of}} <b>resistance</b> <b>build-up</b> is of greater concern. This study focused on Cladobotryum mycophilum's sensitivity to carbendazim and prochloraz manganese following recent reports on decreased efficacy of both fungicides. The median effective dose (ED 50) values for carbendazim ranged between 0. 02 mg/L and 4. 31 mg/L with 60 % of the South African isolates being moderately resistant. The highest resistance factor for carbendazim was 215. Prochloraz manganese ED 50 values varied from 0. 00001 mg/L to 0. 55 mg/L. A significant difference in mean ED 50 values for both fungicides tested was observed. Using cluster analysis, no discrimination of isolates previously exposed and unexposed to prochloraz manganese was observed. A wide range of differences in ED 50 values indicated moderate resistance to carbendazim and high sensitivity to prochloraz manganese among isolates under investigation. Discriminant analysis indicated significant differences between clusters contributed by one or a few variables. This study provided evidence that prochloraz manganese remains highly fungitoxic to C. mycophilum. However, prochloraz manganese is to be used in a disease management strategy in combination with strict farm hygiene management strategies to retain product efficacy and ensure crop protection.

40|$|Yield losses {{occurring}} {{at the field}} level, whether due to plant diseases or abiotic stresses, reveal reduced stability of the crop yield potential. The paper argues that the stability of crop yield potential is a trait with a clear genetic component, which can be successfully selected for at the single-plant level and incorporated into high-yielding cultivars. Two novel selection equations with prognostic power are presented, capable to objectively phenotype and evaluate individual plants in real field conditions {{in the absence of}} the masking effects of interplant competition and soil heterogeneity. The equations predict performance at the crop stand through the key concept of coefficient of homeostasis and are equally useful for early generation selection and for nonstop selection within finished cultivars in order to continuously incorporate the adaptive (genetic or epigenetic) responses of plants. Exploitation of adaptive responses acquires particular importance in view of the climate change effects on crop productivity and the changing biotic or abiotic micro-environments. Cotton is used as a case study to highlight the potential of nonstop selection for increasing crop yield and for the gradual <b>build-up</b> of disease <b>resistance.</b> In addition, the paper envisions and proposes the formation of international networks of researchers focusing on specific diseases as, for example, the cereal root-rot or the cotton Verticillium wilt that will concurrently use the proposed strategy in their respective environments to select for resistant genotypes, while gaining a deeper understanding of the nature of the genetic or epigenetic changes at the phenotypic and genomic levels...|$|R
40|$|Objectives (i) To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} the adherent growth mode and extracellular polymer substance <b>build-up</b> in biofilm <b>resistance</b> to antibiotics. (ii) To re-assess various mechanisms leading to biofilm resistance to antibiotics. Methods We compared the biofilm MICs, biofilm MBCs using the viable count method, biofilm MBCs based on broth recovery methods and minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBECs) of antistaphylococcal antibiotics for multilayer biofilms formed by &# 039;biofilm-positive&# 039; S. epidermidis strains and monolayer biofilms formed by their &# 039;biofilm-negative&# 039; mutants/variants. Bacterial densities and the quantity of persister cells in both multilayer and monolayer biofilms were assessed to {{evaluate the}}ir roles in biofilm resistance. Results Monolayer and multilayer biofilms presented similar susceptibilities to multiple antibiotics, based on biofilm MIC, broth recovery-based biofilm MBC and MBEC results. Multilayer biofilms demonstrated higher viable count-based MBCs than monolayer biofilms. Both monolayer and multilayer biofilms had very high bacterial densities of ? 1011 - 12 cfu/mL. Persister cells were found in both monolayer and multilayer biofilms, but not in planktonic cultures at log phase. The presence of persister cells in monolayer and multilayer biofilms appeared to be strain and antibiotic dependent. Conclusions The adherent growth mode, rather than the ability to build up a typical multilayer biofilm structure, contributes to the high resistance of biofilms to antibiotics, and therefore might be the main virulence factor of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) with respect to antibiotic resistance. The presence of persister cells in CoNS biofilms {{plays an important role in}} antibiotic resistance. Growth at high bacterial densities is another significant factor in biofilm resistance...|$|R
40|$|In {{agricultural}} production systems where the glyphosate-resistant soybean crop (Glycine max) is grown {{and the practice}} of crop rotation with alternative herbicides is not adopted, the exclusive and continuous use of glyphosate has led to the occurrence of resistant weed populations that may limit or compromise the benefits of this technology. Thus, the efficacy of weed management programs, including the use of residual herbicides (sulfentrazone, flumioxazin, imazethapyr, diclosulan, chlorimuron and s-metolachlor) applied in preemergence and followed by in-crop postemergence applications of glyphosate (PRE-POST) were compared to glyphosate postemergence only programs - POST. The study was conducted across nine locations during the 2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011 growing seasons. PRE-POST programs were efficient in the control of Amaranthus viridis, Brachiaria plantaginea, Bidens pilosa, Commelina benghalensis, Eleusine indica, Euphorbia heterophylla and Raphanus raphanistrum, with the level of control being similar when comparing the program with two applications of glyphosate POST. Some PRE-POST programs were not efficient in controlling Cenchrus echinatus, Ipomoea hederifolia and Ipomoea triloba. Sulfentrazone and diclosulam PRE-POST programs improved the control of Ipomoea triloba compared to sequential applications of glyphosate alone. No significant differences in soybean yield were observed between any of the herbicide treatments or study locations. The use of residual herbicides in preemergence followed by glyphosate in-crop postemergence provides consistent weed control and reducing early season weed competition. Furthermore, these programs utilize at least two herbicide modes of action for herbicide use diversity, which will be needed to stay ahead of <b>resistance</b> <b>build-up,</b> regardless of when weeds may appear...|$|R
40|$|The <b>build-up</b> of pipe-soil <b>resistance</b> {{that can}} be mobilized on a seabed pipeline, {{particularly}} in the axial direction, is affected by consolidation of the seabed beneath the pipeline after it is laid. On fine-grained soils the consolidation period may extend well beyond the laying period, and involve a significant gain in pipe-soil resistance: a process analogous to the set-up of piles driven in clay. The available level of pipe-soil resistance affects many aspects of pipeline design, such as stability on route curves and down slopes, geohazard vulnerability, lateral buckling and axial walking behaviour. This paper considers consolidation around on-bottom pipelines through a numerical study, supported by field data. The soil is modeled as an elastic material with coupled Biot consolidation. Pipe embedments of up to 0. 5 diameters have been considered {{and the effect of}} soil berms adjacent to the pipe, formed of the displaced soil, has been explored. The solutions and guidance provided in this paper allow pipeline designers to estimate the 'set-up' periods over which the effective stress at the pipe-soil interface will rise in the period after laying, indicating the build-up of available axial pipe-soil resistance. The results account for the enhancement of this resistance through a 'wedging' action. The dissipation process is retarded by a factor of up to 2 if the displaced soil forms a berm that is collapsed against the pipe wall. Similar solutions for the analogous situation of consolidation ('set-up') around driven piles have existed for many years. This paper provides the equivalent design tool for on-bottom pipelines.

40|$|Fly ash {{components}} in the flue gas can stick onto heat exchanger tubes and cumulate into solid deposits. This fouling phenomenon is a common issue in fluidized bed boilers, where challenging fuels with possibly high and challenging ash content are often fired in. Basic characteristics of the phenomenon are discussed briefly, followed by a short review {{of research on the}} methods of modelling and predicting fouling tendency. A method to examine fouling through heat transfer calculations was tested in this thesis. Primary aim was to verify applicability of this selected method in real large-scale boilers via performing a retrospective analysis on earlier measurement data. Reference clean state heat transfer coefficients of certain heat exchangers were compared to calculated states by using data from control system log files, and the comparisons were formulated into thermal resistances of the deposit layer. The control system log files contained data from earlier measurement campaigns. Calculated thermal resistances increased along cumulating deposition, until a cleansing soot blowing pulse is actuated. Slopes of these rising thermal resistance curves were extracted, forming estimates of fouling rates per each fouling period. Calculated thermal <b>resistance</b> <b>build-ups</b> matched soot blowing operation times well with only a few exceptions, and so the selected method seemed to express actual fouling decently in general. Calculated resistances and fouling rates were compared to other operational factors, including main steam power, fuel feed variation and measured flue gas pressure change at studied heat exchangers. Certain findings were made, even though available data was not completely sufficient. While decent correlation with slight steam power changes was not identifiable, studying the flue gas pressure change showed very evident relation with thermal resistances. Fuel mixture appeared to affect the fouling rates, but not consistently with small changes in the fuel feed. Conclusions of fouling differences between superheater and economizer temperature zones could not be made...|$|R
50|$|The adult moths are {{comparatively}} small, with a wingspan of 3-4 cm, {{and have}} a characteristic resting posture that conceals the black and orange-yellow hindwings under the greyish-brown forewings. Males and females emerge more or less simultaneously and mating takes place {{within a couple of}} days. Eggs are laid on tender new leaves, placed singly near the veins, and usually on the undersurface. They are oval, flat, and white and measure about 1 mm in length. About 500 eggs are laid per female with a recorded maximum of 1000. Larvae hatch in about two days. There are five larval instars. The first and second instars mainly feed on the leaf surface. Starting with the third instar, the larva cuts out a leaf flap, usually {{at the edge of the}} leaf, folds it over, fastens it with silk, and feeds from within. The entire leaf, excluding the major veins of tender leaves, is eaten, but more veins are left in older leaves. Under the optimal conditions, the larval period lasts 10-12 days. The full-grown larva measures about 3.5-4.5 cm, and there is considerable colour variation in the fourth and fifth instars; the body may be either wholly black or dark greyish to black, with longitudinal coloured bands may include a dorsal orange or ocherous band and lateral white lines. A recent study revealed the existence of density-dependent colour polyphenism and <b>resistance</b> <b>build-up</b> against invading baculovirus by H. puera larvae. The mature larvae descend to the ground on silken threads and pupate under a thin layer of leaf litter or soil, within loosely built cocoons made of dry or decayed leaves, or soil particles held together with silk. Pupation may some times occur within green leaves of other plants in the under growth, folded or juxtaposed with silk. On Avicennia plants the caterpillars pupate inside the cases made out of the host plant leaves itself. It is probably an adaptive trait acquired by the species for surviving in the hostile mangrove environment, since the pupation is not possible in the muddy and inundated soils of mangroves. The average pupal period lasts six to eight days under optimal conditions. There is no evidence of hibernation or aestivation of pupa.|$|R
