5|$|Borneo tallow nut oil, {{extracted}} from the fruit of species of genus Shorea. Used {{as a substitute for}} <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter,</b> and to make soap, candles, cosmetics and medicines in places where the tree is common.|$|E
50|$|Pharmaceutical {{companies}} heavily use <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter's</b> physical properties. As a nontoxic solid at {{room temperature}} that melts at body temperature, it is considered an ideal base for medicinal suppositories.|$|R
40|$|Color of <b>cocoa</b> <b>butters</b> was {{measured}} using a CM- 2002 Minolta Spectrocolorimeter. The {{results showed that the}} ‘’L’’ values (lightness) varied from 73. 11 to 84. 76, the ‘’a’’ values (greenness) varied from – 2. 15 to – 1. 08 and a redness of 4. 99, and the ‘’b’’ values (yellowness) varied from 28. 63 to 41. 11. Acidities of all typescocoa butters varied from 0. 47 to 10. 26. The best <b>cocoa</b> <b>butters</b> were obtained from staly and fully purple beans and cocoa beans of grades 4, 5, and 6. These butters had acidities of 0. 48 and 0. 56 for fully purple and staly beans and 2. 41, 1. 30, and 0. 47 for grades 4, 5, and 6, respectively...|$|R

25|$|As a solid {{piece of}} chocolate, the <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter</b> fat {{particles}} {{are in a}} crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter</b> are able to break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases – the melting process. When the heat is removed, the <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter</b> crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.|$|E
25|$|After fermentation, {{the beans}} are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, {{which are then}} ground to cocoa mass, {{unadulterated}} chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor also may be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter.</b> Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter</b> in varying proportions, without any added sugars. Much of the chocolate consumed today {{is in the form}} of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter</b> or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter,</b> sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.|$|E
25|$|The final {{process is}} called tempering. Uncontrolled {{crystallization}} of <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter</b> typically results in crystals of varying size, {{some or all}} {{large enough to be}} clearly seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken. The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the result of consistently small <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter</b> crystals produced by the tempering process.|$|E
50|$|Some {{preparations}} {{known as}} confectioner's coating or summer coating may {{be confused with}} white chocolate, but are made from inexpensive solid or hydrogenated vegetable and animal fats, and {{are not at all}} derived from cocoa. These preparations may actually be white (in contrast to white chocolate's ivory shade) and will lack <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter's</b> flavor.|$|R
5000|$|Semolina {{porridge}} (...) {{is served}} with sugar, honey, cinnamon or <b>cocoa</b> with <b>butter</b> on the top. Optionally, sliced apples or apricots are added as toppings. Healthier versions substitute semolina for oatmeal or rice.|$|R
40|$|Crystallization is a {{critical}} step of the entire process and for quality in chocolate production. Problems may arise from the different nucleation tendencies of <b>cocoa</b> <b>butters,</b> their polymorphism and {{from the lack of}} knowledge about appropriate process parameters. The cooling time needed for the nucleation within the chocolate mass depends on the mechanical effects of the tempering unit and on the nucleation tendency of the formulation. Thermoanalytical measurements (DSC) may help to calculate crystallization behaviour and to find the optimal cooking conditions. High shearing of the tempering machine accelerates the crystallization process and forces the development of the desired high-melting modifications of fat-crystals...|$|R
25|$|Hershey's Kisses Hugs and Hershey's Kisses Cookies 'N' Creme {{are made}} with the {{ingredient}} PGPR (Polyglycerol polyricinoleate, E476), which {{is used as a}} cheaper replacement for <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter.</b>|$|E
25|$|The fats in <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter</b> can {{crystallize}} in {{six different}} forms (polymorphous crystallization). The {{primary purpose of}} tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.|$|E
25|$|Fats {{and oils}} rich in stearic acid are more {{abundant}} in animal fat (up to 30%) than in vegetable fat (typically <5%). The important exceptions are <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter</b> and shea butter, where the stearic acid content (as a triglyceride) is 28–45%.|$|E
50|$|The brigadeiro (Portuguese for Brigadier) is {{a common}} Brazilian delicacy, created in 1940. The brigadeiro is made from {{condensed}} milk, <b>cocoa</b> powder, <b>butter</b> and chocolate sprinkles to cover the outside layer.

25|$|Cocoa beans, <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter</b> and {{cocoa powder}} are traded on two world exchanges: ICE Futures U.S. and NYSE Liffe Futures and Options. The London market {{is based on}} West African cocoa and New York on cocoa {{predominantly}} from Southeast Asia. Cocoa is the world's smallest soft commodity market.|$|E
25|$|Producers of high-quality, small-batch {{chocolate}} {{argue that}} mass production produces bad-quality chocolate. Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter.</b> Vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor {{are often used}} in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} {{in which the}} crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation {{would depend on the}} milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter</b> fat. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.|$|E
40|$|Pyrolysis-mass {{spectrometry}} (Py-MS) is {{an analytical}} fingerprinting technique, that offers distinct advantages {{in the field}} of food analysis. The sample is quickly decomposed at several hundred *C and the resulting fragments are analysed by mass spectrometry. The mass spectra are subsequently submitted to multi-variate data analysis. Py-MS was succesfully applied to the determination of the geographical origin of <b>cocoa</b> <b>butters,</b> the detection of addea whey proteins in milk, the characterisation of vinegar and wine and the ripening stages of cheese. By a careful control of the pyrolysis, Py-MS can be applied for the determination of the 180 - 160 ratio in food (pyrolysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry, Py-IRMS). an example isz given for the determination of the geographocal origin of olive oils.

25|$|Usually, an {{emulsifying}} agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, {{though a}} few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes {{at the cost of}} a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter</b> while maintaining the same mouthfeel.|$|E
25|$|The {{future price}} of <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter</b> and cocoa powder is {{determined}} by multiplying the bean price by a ratio. The combined butter and powder ratio has tended to be around 3.5. If the combined ratio falls below 3.2 or so, production ceases to be economically viable and some factories cease extraction of butter and powder and trade exclusively in cocoa liquor.|$|E
25|$|The {{dried beans}} are then transported to a {{chocolate}} manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), roasted, and graded. Next, {{the shell of}} each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor. The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter.</b>|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{varieties}} of cannabis infusions {{owing to the}} variety of non-volatile solvents used. The plant material is mixed with the solvent and then pressed and filtered to express the oils of the plant into the solvent. Examples of solvents used in this process are <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter,</b> dairy butter, cooking oil, glycerine, and skin moisturizers. Depending on the solvent, these {{may be used in}} cannabis foods or applied topically.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter</b> content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans {{out in the sun}} from five to seven days.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{consumption}} of {{large quantities of}} any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories, can {{increase the risk of}} weight gain and possibly obesity. Raw chocolate is high in <b>cocoa</b> <b>butter,</b> a fat which is removed during chocolate refining, then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, sugars, and milk as well, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.|$|E
