40|$|Parliaments are the {{institutions}} through which governments are held {{accountable to the}} electorate. They have {{a wide range of}} tools with which to carry out this oversight function, but until recently little analysis had been undertaken on the characteristics or use of such tools. This paper uses data for 83 countries that was collected in 2001 to investigate whether the oversight potential relates to three variables, namely the form of government (presidential, semi-presidential, or parliamentary), per capita income levels, and the level of democracy. The paper finds that oversight potential is greatly affected by the form of government, per capita income levels, and levels of democracy. Countries with parliamentary forms of government, higher income levels, and which are more democratic have a greater number of oversight tools and greater oversight potential. While the oversight potential follows this general trend, the use <b>of</b> <b>committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry,</b> interpellations and ombudsman offices follows a different pattern. The use of interpellations as an oversight tool is most common in high income countries, less common in low income countries and least common in middle income countries while the presence <b>of</b> <b>committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> and <b>of</b> the ombudsman offices is most common in middle income countries, less common in high income countries and least common in low income countries.

Ill health forced Salmond to retire in 1943; however he remained President of the Royal Air Force Club for 23 years and regularly appeared at major RAF events. He became Honorary Air Commodore of No. 3618 (County of Sussex) Fighter Control Unit of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force on 5 January 1950 and {{attended the}} coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953.

25|$|In 1894, a Land Commission was {{appointed}} {{to deal with the}} settlement of Africans on the land. The Commission recommended that two large territories be set aside for native occupation, the Shangani and Gwaai Reserves in Matabeleland, of about 2,486,000 acres. Before the arrival of the Europeans, Africans had held nearly 100,000,000 acres in what became Southern Rhodesia. The Land Commission's plan showed such poor judgment, and the bases of allocation were so ill-considered, that the attempt to confine the native population within these two areas was never really practicable. Failure to make suitable provision for African lands may {{have been one of the}} prime causes of the Matabele and Mashona rebellions of 1896. Following these rebellions, BSAC was required to assign sufficient land to Southern Rhodesian Africans for their agricultural and pastoral requirements, including access to sufficient water. Native Reserves were set up under this directive, which by 1902 had an estimated indigenous population of 530,000. Although later modifications were made, the basic pattern of land allocation persisted until independence. The European district officers who responsible for defining the reserves were advised to allow between 9 and 15 acres of arable land for each family, and adequate pasture, but they had little geographic knowledge of the country and no maps. In 1910, a Native Affairs <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Enquiry</b> was set up, which made very few changes. The Committee's land apportionment was 19 million acres for Europeans and 21.4 million acres for Native Reserves with an African population of about 700,000. A further 51.6 million acres was unassigned, but available for future alienation to Europeans.|$|E
40|$|Britain's {{share of}} world ship-building has {{declined}} catastrophically during the twentieth century. Successive <b>committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> have attributed {{this to a}} loss of competitiveness deriving both from poor production methods and laggardly innovation. An examination of innovation in ship design and construction and in marine propulsion highlights the declining British contribution in these fields. The conservative attitude adopted at various times by the Royal Navy together with restrictive arrangements in engine design and building seem to have been central in this. Additionally, few graduate engineers have been recruited either into management or into research, development, and design. For the future, a co-ordinated policy on research together with greater specialization in markets should be sought. ...|$|R
40|$|Briefly, between 1912 and 1966 {{there was}} an {{independent}} Secretary for Defence, described in the Acts and the Permanent Force Regulations as the “Permanent Head of the Department”. Not only was this not true in practice after the establishment in 1918 {{of the office of}} Chief of the General Staff (later at various times General Officer Commanding the UDF, Commandant-General and Chief of the SADF) but the meaning of the characterisation was never clearly defined. A minefield of prerogatives and consequent overlapping developed between the two office holders and their staffs. Those attempts at solution all ignored the fundamental constitutional principles behind the establishment of the Secretariat as well as the principles of organizational theory, ambiguity about authority, mministerial failures, the personalities involved and ill-considered appointments and also the failure to exploit the benefits of a Secretariat. After years of conflict, worsened by the demands of the Second World War and recommendations by several <b>committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiries</b> and the Public Service Commission, the Secretariat was taken into the SADF, in a civilian capacity under the Comptroller. Between 1966 and 1968 it was absorbed into the various Staff Sections at DHQ.    The results were perhaps a mixed blessing.   In some areas it was very successful.    But many of the defects remained. </p...|$|R

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. What is {{the best}} use of fishery performance? How can we assess {{progress}} in managing aquaculture and wild catch fisheries when a wide range of criteria is appropriate? The Australian Fisheries Research and Development Corporation funded a project in 2009 to estimate the benefits arising from managing fisheries and aquaculture and then compare best use to current outcomes. This project was repeated in 2014. These projects used the ‘Delphi Method’ with the collection of individual expert views in successive rounds of confidential consultation. At each stage a professional facilitator fed back to the panel of experts the results of the previous round.  The project design allowed for both the identification of what experts regarded {{the best use of}} marine resources to be, as well as an assessment of the gap between current performance and best use. The 2014 project indicated that there was an AUD 1 Billion gap between current fishery performance and best outcomes.   This presentation will briefly outline the results of these projects and then discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the methodology applied as against alternatives such as expert assessment, <b>committees</b> <b>of</b> experts and public <b>committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry...</b>|$|R

[...] Following {{the victory of the}} New Zealand Labour Party in elections in 1984, Prime Minister David Lange barred nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ships from using New Zealand ports or entering New Zealand waters. [...] Reasons given were the dangers of nuclear weapons, continued nuclear testing in the South Pacific, and opposition to US President Ronald Reagan's policy of aggressively confronting the Soviet Union. Given that the United States Navy refused to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons aboard ships, these laws essentially refused access to New Zealand ports for all United States Navy ships. In February 1985, a port-visit request by the United States for the USS Buchanan was refused by the New Zealand government on the basis that the Buchanan was capable of launching nuclear depth bombs. [...] An opinion poll commissioned by the 1986 Defence <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Enquiry</b> confirmed that 92 per cent now opposed nuclear weapons in New Zealand and 69 per cent opposed warship visits; 92 per cent wanted New Zealand to promote nuclear disarmament through the UN, while 88 per cent supported the promotion of nuclear free zones.|$|E

2500|$|Dowding's {{subsequent}} downfall {{has been}} attributed {{by some to}} his singlemindedness and perceived lack of diplomacy and political savoir faire in dealing with intra-RAF challenges and intrigues, most obviously the [...] still even now hotly debated Big Wing controversy in which a number of senior and active service officers had argued in favour of large set-piece air battles with the Luftwaffe {{as an alternative to}} Dowding's successful Fabian strategy. Another reason often cited for his removal, but characterised by some contemporary commentators more as a pretext, was the difficulty of countering German nighttime bombing raids on British cities. The account of radar pioneer, E. G. Bowen in Radar Days (1987) rebuts the claim that Dowding's grasp of the problems of British night fighters [...] was inadequate. He suggests that if Dowding had been left to follow his own path, the ultimately effective British response to night bombing (which depended completely on developments in air-borne radar) would have come somewhat sooner. Dowding himself showed that he had a good grasp of night fighter defence and was planning a defence system against night bombing in a letter he wrote some time after the Battle of Britain. However, there was great political and public pressure during the Blitz for something to be done, and Fighter Command's existing resources without, as yet, airborne radar, proved woefully inadequate. A <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> chaired by Sir John Salmond produced a long list of recommendations to improve night air defence; when Dowding approved only some of them, his erstwhile supporters, Lord Beaverbrook and Churchill, decided {{that it was time for}} him to step down.|$|E
