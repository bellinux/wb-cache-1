The kodo millet, also known as <b>cow</b> <b>grass,</b> rice grass, ditch millet, Native Paspalum, or Indian Crown Grass originates in tropical Africa, and it is estimated to have been domesticated in India 3000 years ago. The domestication process is still ongoing. In southern India, it is called kodo or kodra, and it is grown as an annual. It is a minor food crop eaten in many Asian countries, primarily in India where in some regions it is extremely important. It grows wild as a perennial in the west of Africa, where it is eaten as a famine food. Often it grows as a weed in rice fields. Many farmers do not mind it, {{as it can be}} harvested as an alternative crop if their primary crop fails. In the Southern United States and Hawaii, it {{is considered to be a}} noxious weed.|$|E
40|$|Recently, as rapid {{urbanization}} takes place, {{natural vegetation}} is removed, land slopes are modified and paved over. Sediment from eroded and unstable stream banks and cleared areas were carried by surface runoff in storm water deposited downstream; filling ponds and streambeds reducing the natural river storage capacity and hence causing frequent flash flood occurrence. Current measures {{taken by the}} government to overcome these problems using silt fence barrier, sediment traps and sediment pond are mostly costly and not environmental-friendly. Nowadays, the usage of vegetation has been widely used for controlling soil erosion as it is cost effective, easy to handle and it has an aesthetic value. However, limited information has been noted in the used of local plant for suspended sediment control. Therefore, this research was conducted to focus on the usage of local plants as natural method to trap suspended sediment from surface runoff. This research focused on the usage of grass types for suspended sediment control measures. <b>Cow</b> <b>grass,</b> Pearl grass and Philippine grass are used with a mixed of 0. 6 kg sieved soil and 10 L clean water, for different percentage of area covered (25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 %) at different planting profile which is top and toe. From the results obtained, it is found that at 100 % area covered for both planting profile, all covers have successfully retained 100 % suspended sediment. For 75 % and 50 % area covered, highest trapped was recorded at 99. 8 % and 98. 9 % by Pearl grass at toe area respectively. While for 25 % area covered, highest trapped was recorded at toe area at 96. 3 % by <b>Cow</b> <b>grass.</b> The lowest trapped was recorded by Phillipines grass at top area for all 75, 50 and 25 % area covered at 82. 2, 80. 5 and 80. 0 % suspended sediment respectively.

Normal supplementation rate of Calliandra calothyrsus is around 20-40%.In Uganda, Calliandra calothyrsus is mostly mixed with other fodder for <b>cows</b> (<b>grasses,</b> tree species…). Calliandra calothyrsus leaves do not contain any toxic compounds but high condensed tannins concentrations, which could limit the digestibility for ruminants. It {{has been shown that}} moderate condensed tannin concentrations (2-4% dry matter) can enhance the protein metabolism for ruminants. However, high tannin levels up to 11% {{have a negative effect on}} the digestibility mechanisms. Monogastric animals seem to have more problems to metabolize the amount of tannins in Calliandra calothyrsus. Calliandra calothyrsus should not be used in grazing regions only, because the risk that animals destroy the tree bark is high, which leads to a high tree mortality. Animals should eat freshly cut Calliandra leaves that were cut between 0 and 1 meter. Apparently, dry leaves seem to be less palatable to animals. Some beneficial effects of using Calliandra calothyrsus as fodder have been observed in Uganda, where farmers noticed an increase in milk production.

Diets were formulated to contain 30 % NDF (DMB). In trial 1, four lactating Holstein cows (475 kg) with cannulas in the rumen and proximal duodenum were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square experiment to evaluate the treatments effects on digestive function. In trial 2, eight multiparous Holstein cows (567 kg) with 80 ? 8 DIM were utilized in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design to evaluate treatment effects of on DMI and lactational performance. There were no treatment effects (P > 0. 10) on ruminal digestion of OM, and NDF, averaging 51 and 31 %, respectively. Microbial efficiency (g microbial N/ kg OM fermented) was greater (20 %, P = 0. 07) for alfalfa (30) than for grass hay substituted diets (25). Nonammonia N flow to the small intestine, {{as a percentage of}} N intake (ruminal N efficiency) averaged 101 %, and was lower (linear effect, P 0. 10) on total tract digestion of OM, and NDF, averaging 70 and 43 %, respectively. Digestible energy content of the diet was lower (5 %, P 0. 20) on DMI, milk yield, averaging 21. 8 and 32. 2 kg, respectively.

In the second experiment, 5 multiparous Finnish Ayrshire cows (53 d in milk) were assigned to 1 of 2 blocks and allocated treatments according to a replicated 3 ? 3 Latin square design, with 14 -d periods to compare hay, UTS, and FAS.

Mammary FA uptake was higher and the synthesis of 16 : 0 lower in <b>cows</b> fed fresh <b>grass</b> than hay. Conservation of grass by drying or ensiling had no influence on mammary extraction of TAG and NEFA, despite an increase in milk fat secretion for silages compared with hay and for FAS than UTS. Relative to hay, milk fat from fresh grass contained lower 12 : 0, 14 : 0, and 16 : 0 and higher S 3,R 7,R 11, 15 -tetramethyl- 16 : 0, cis- 9 18 : 1, trans- 11 18 : 1, cis- 9,trans- 11 18 : 2, 18 : 2 n- 6, and 18 : 3 n- 3 concentrations. Even though conserved forages altered mammary lipogenesis, differences in milk FA composition were relatively minor, other than a higher enrichment of S 3,R 7,R 11, 15 -tetramethyl- 16 : 0 in milk from silages compared with hay. In conclusion, differences in milk fat composition on fresh grass relative to conserved forages were associated with a lower energy balance, increased uptake of preformed FA, and decreased synthesis of 16 : 0 de novo in the mammary glands, in the absence of alterations in stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase activity.

40|$|The {{effects of}} forage {{conservation}} method on plasma lipids, mammary lipogenesis, and milk fat {{were examined in}} 2 complementary experiments. Treatments comprised fresh grass, hay, or untreated (UTS) or formic acid treated silage (FAS) prepared from the same grass sward. Preparation of conserved forages coincided with the collection of samples from <b>cows</b> fed fresh <b>grass.</b> In the first experiment, 5 multiparous Finnish Ayrshire cows (229 d in milk) were used to compare a diet based on fresh grass followed by hay during 2 consecutive 14 -d periods, separated by a 5 -d transition during which extensively wilted grass was fed. In the second experiment, 5 multiparous Finnish Ayrshire cows (53 d in milk) were assigned to 1 of 2 blocks and allocated treatments according to a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design, with 14 -d periods to compare hay, UTS, and FAS. Cows received 7 or 9 kg/d of the same concentrate in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Arterial concentrations of triacylglycerol (TAG) and phospholipid were higher in <b>cows</b> fed fresh <b>grass,</b> UTS, and FAS compared with hay. Nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations and the relative abundance of 18 : 2 n- 6 and 18 : 3 n- 3 in TAG of arterial blood were also higher in <b>cows</b> fed fresh <b>grass</b> than conserved forages. On all diets, TAG was the principle source of fatty acids (FA) for milk fat synthesis, whereas mammary extraction of NEFA was negligible, except during zero-grazing, which {{was associated with a}} lower, albeit positive calculated energy balance. Mammary FA uptake was higher and the synthesis of 16 : 0 lower in <b>cows</b> fed fresh <b>grass</b> than hay.
