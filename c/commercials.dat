40|$|Master of EducationOne of {{the most}} {{important}} decisions which had to be made in this study of <b>commercial</b> education concerned the meaning of the term, <b>commercial</b> education, itself. Thus some people would think of <b>commercial</b> education as the teaching of the <b>commercial</b> skills of shorthand, typewriting and bookkeeping; others would give it a broader meaning to make it synonymous with an education designed for a <b>commercial</b> career; yet others think of <b>commercial</b> education, at least that which existed between 1850 and 1900, as the alternative to a classical training. Naturally, each of these definitions would allow a different interpretation of the course which might be taught in a school. Under the first definition, subjects such as English, arithmetic, sciences and modern languages would not be a part of <b>commercial</b> education; under the last two definitions, it was possible to have a <b>commercial</b> education without any of the <b>commercial</b> skills. For the purpose of this thesis, <b>commercial</b> meant more than the teaching of <b>commercial</b> skills, for of the many educational institutions which claimed to provide <b>commercial</b> courses, only the business colleges were restricted to this narrow concept of <b>commercial</b> education. But neither was the definition used which explained <b>commercial</b> education as the alternative to a classical course. This definition automatically placed all the 'modern' subjects in the <b>commercial</b> course, and this was obviously not the general idea of a <b>commercial</b> course held by all interested parties during these seventy-five years. Instead, the vocational definition of <b>commercial</b> education was used, and <b>commercial</b> education referred to any training which prepared for a <b>commercial</b> career. Thus <b>commercial</b> education covered training given in a school or 'on the job'. It included French or any other 'modern' subject, provided the subject was taught for a <b>commercial</b> career.

40|$|Forces entirely {{apart from}} {{rationality}} shape <b>commercial</b> law. A turn to aesthetics directs {{attention to the}} non-rational elements at play in this law. These suppressed elements privilege <b>commercial</b> actors by deterring consideration of legal limitations on <b>commercial</b> activity that could be socially desirable. Problematic features of <b>commercial</b> law take two different forms. First, there are types of <b>commercial</b> transactions encouraged by U. S. <b>commercial</b> law the very structures of which raise fairness and efficiency concerns. Second, {{the sheer volume of}} <b>commercial</b> transactions and the lack of legal controls requiring market actors to internalize ensuing economic, social and environmental costs raise serious questions about the desirability of laws designed to encourage perpetual escalation of <b>commercial</b> activity. These problematic aspects of <b>commercial</b> law invoke difficult questions. How do we determine what levels and forms of <b>commercial</b> activity are optimal? If commitment to a more balanced approach to <b>commercial</b> activity were possible, who would be helped, who would be harmed, and how? The aesthetics of <b>commercial</b> law deters engagement with these questions by informing certain non-rational, pre-reflective dispositions that enable common refrains against reform. Much of contemporary <b>commercial</b> law scholarship employs economic modeling or empiricism. Empirical findings or successful economic models, however, do not automatically become fruitful bases for law reform. Aesthetic elements of <b>commercial</b> law affect the capacity to translate the results of analytical approaches (quantitative or otherwise) into law reform.
