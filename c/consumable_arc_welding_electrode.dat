5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> <b>Consumable</b> <b>electrode</b> processes such as shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the <b>electrode</b> affects <b>weld</b> properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow <b>welds.</b> Nonconsumable <b>electrode</b> processes, such as gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged <b>electrode</b> causes shallow <b>welds,</b> while a negatively charged <b>electrode</b> makes deeper <b>welds.</b> Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|R
30|$|The arc plasma is the ionized {{state of}} the welding gas and {{is a mixture of}} almost equal amounts of {{electrons}} and ions. The plasma carries the arc current. Most of the current conduction is carried by the electrons. In the case of <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> the <b>electrode</b> is generally assumed to be the cathode and the workpiece is the anode. The electrons flow out from the electrode (i.e. the negative terminal) and are forwarded into the workpiece (i.e. the positive terminal) (Naidu et al. 2003). To determine the effects of arc plasma on the weld pool, four factors should be considered (i) heat flux, (ii) current density, (iii) shear stress, and (iv) arc pressure.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, Cape Town, 2001 Since the {{discovery}} of <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> at the beginning ofthe century, metal transfer has been a topic ofresearch interest. Metal transfer can, in fact be related to weld quality, because it affects the arc stability. Furthermore, it determines the weld spatter, penetration, deposition rate and welding position. Gas Metal <b>Arc</b> <b>Welding</b> (also known as Metal Inert Gas- or MIG welding) is the most co=on method for <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> steels and aluminurn alloys. Approximately 40 % of the production welding {{in the country is}} accomplished by this process in which the thermal phenomena and melting ofthe solid electrode are coupled to the plasma <b>arc</b> and the <b>weld</b> pool. Thus the therrno- fluid behaviour of the electrode and detaching drops can have significant effects on the subsequent weld quality and production rate. The knowledge of how metal transfer affects this <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> process is important for welding control and process automation, {{as well as in the}} development of improved <b>welding</b> <b>consumables.</b> Gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> has a distinct feature, indicated by the results of Lesnewich [24], [23], that for most gases, there is a discrete metal droplet formation change between low and high current operations. Naturally the droplet size will have a significant influence on the properties ofthe welds. In globular transfer which occurs at low current, the <b>welding</b> <b>electrode</b> melts and produces large droplets (usually larger in diameter than the electrode wire diameter). This mode of transfer is associated with high spatter levels and thus undesirable in terms of welding economics. An increase in welding current will, for most welding! shielding gases, produce metal transfer with smaller droplets, which is termed spray transfer. This mode oftransfer is associated with high voltage and amperage settings, thus producing high deposition rates limited to the flaUhorizontal position...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWelding {{is one of}} the {{important}} processes in most of the manufacturing process chains.

Copper cladding of mild steel substrates by deposition from strip electrodes using the submerged <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> {{process has been}} successful. A wide range of parameters, and several fluxes have been investigated. The range of deposit compositions is 66. 4 % Cu to 95. 7 % Cu.

Empirical equations derived using theoretical considerations characterize the weld bead dimensions as functions of the welding parameters and hence composition. The melting rate for strip electrodes is dependent upon the current-voltage product. Weld nugget size is increased by increased thermal transfer efficiencies resulting from stirring which is current dependent. The presence of Fe 2 O 3 in a flux has been demonstrated to diminish electrode melting rate and drastically increase penetration, making flux choice the prime consideration in cladding operations.

It is highly emphasised in manufacturing especially because of its ability to restore worn parts. SAW is characterised by a large number of process parameters influencing the performance outputs such as deposition rate, dilution and hardness, which subsequently affect weld quality. An exhaustive literature survey indicates that five control factors, viz., arc current, <b>arc</b> voltage, <b>welding</b> speed, <b>electrode</b> stick-out and preheat temperature, predominantly influence weld quality. In relation to this, an attempt has been made in this study to analyse the effect of process parameters on outputs of welding using the Taguchi method.
