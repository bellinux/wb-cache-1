5|$|The {{first episode}} of Neighbours saw Daphne hired to strip at Des Clarke's (Paul Keane) bucks party. When {{the night was}} {{interrupted}} by a neighbour, Daphne left some belongings behind and returned the following morning to collect them. Des's fianc√©e assumed she had spent the night and called the wedding off. Realising that Des needed a lodger to help him pay the mortgage off, Daphne moved in. Des was instantly attracted to Daphne, but he tried to hide his feelings and became awkward around her. Josephine Monroe, author of Neighbours: The First 10 Years, wrote that the local men queued up to date Daphne, but it was Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien) who first <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> and they soon began a relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Corporal Nobbs and Sergeant Colon {{begin an}} {{investigation}} into the theft of the fifty-foot painting, The Battle of Koom Valley by the insane artist Methodia Rascal, from a city art gallery. Most of the populace believe the painting holds clues to a treasure hidden in Koom Valley. [...] Nobbs has a new girlfriend, exotic dancer Tawneee; Nobby first <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> when slipping an IOU into her garter. [...] Other subplots involve the tension between vampires and werewolves (new recruit Lance-Constable von Humpeding and Sergeant Angua), and the presence of Vetinari's auditor, A.E. Pessimal, in the Watch House.|$|E
60|$|They {{started their}} horses, but a dog-tooth violet, {{shouldering}} amongst the maidenhair, <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> {{and made her}} rein in again.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} to see his lithe form drop softly from a near-by tree. As he <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> upon him his face lighted with that frank and radiant smile that had won her {{confidence}} the day before.|$|R
60|$|The {{night before}} he had written letters and telegrams. Once he had {{looked up at her}} as she sat with a book in her hand across the saloon, and <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She had been pretending not to watch him.|$|R
60|$|For {{one moment}} Marguerite <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> husband's <b>eye.</b> No one was within earshot.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be quiet!" [...] said Mrs. Porter {{from the}} doorway, and Steve, {{wheeling}} round, <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> and collapsed like a pricked balloon.|$|E
60|$|Helen glanced towards Lucy, Elizabeth <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> {{and smiled}} {{in a way}} which almost {{compensated}} for all her unkindness in their dispute an hour before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{is that in}} scarlet?" [...] asked Hetty, {{as soon as the}} Captain's uniform <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> [...] "Tell me, Judith, is it {{the friend}} of Hurry?" ...|$|E
60|$|Iris sighed heavily, Then she <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> husband's <b>eyes</b> {{gathering}} with doubt, and {{she smiled}} again.|$|R
60|$|Womble looked {{with quick}} {{suspicion}} at Theresa and <b>caught</b> in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{a glint of}} pleased surprise.|$|R
60|$|As Portia bent {{to arrange}} the sofa-cushions comfortably, the tiny silver pitcher hanging at her neck swung forward and <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>eye.</b>|$|R
60|$|Anna said nothing. The {{young man}} {{opposite}} was straining his ears {{to listen to}} their conversation. Mrs. White <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> and smiled benignly down the table.|$|E
60|$|As {{she turned}} over the pages a pencil mark <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> Thence words were {{underlined}} and further accentuated by a deeply scored line in the margin.|$|E
60|$|It {{was this}} allusion to her brother's coming visit which had <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> {{in the tower}} staircase, {{and led to a}} {{modification}} in the wedding arrangement.|$|E
60|$|Janet <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>eye,</b> {{and both}} felt a spasm of {{uncontrollable}} diversion in their throats, making Janet turn her back, and Carey gasp {{and turn on}} the boys.|$|R
60|$|Sally sat in silence, but she {{attended}} to Philip's wants in a thoughtful fashion that charmed him. It was pleasant {{to have her}} beside him, and {{now and then he}} glanced at her sunburned, healthy face. Once he <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and she smiled quietly. When supper was over Jane and a small brother were sent down to a brook that ran {{at the bottom of the}} meadow to fetch a pail of water for washing up.|$|R
60|$|I <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> quick <b>eye</b> for {{a moment}} and knew she had more to say to me, but neither she nor I had the skill and alacrity to get that said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not you," [...] said Mr. Hoopdriver. He {{waited until}} he <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> then with his native {{courtesy}} smiled, raised his cap, and wished her good evening.|$|E
60|$|But Nan was {{too busy}} to talk. She deftly searched the girl's pocket and found the notebook. The {{shorthand}} writing <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> at once but the characters were unknown to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do," [...] said Alison. Hodder <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> again, {{and this}} time he was sure that she {{surprised}} in him a certain disdain of Mr. Atterbury's zeal. Her smile was faint, yet unmistakable.|$|E
60|$|A soft stertorous {{breathing}} interrupted him. Tom, chin on chest, was asleep. Polly, with {{a significant}} look, <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> uncle's <b>eye.</b> Then <b>her</b> father, after an uneasy restless movement, lifted drowsy lids.|$|R
6000|$|She gave no look {{to thank}} him--she rather looked away; she only said {{at once to}} her servant, [...] "In ten minutes"; and then to her visitor, as the man went out, [...] "We'll go somewhere--I shall like that. But I must ask of you time--as little as possible--to get ready." [...] She looked over the room to provide for him, keep him there. [...] "There are books and things--plenty; and I dress very quickly." [...] He <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> only as she went, on which he thought them pretty and touching.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{say that}} you are stupid--that is--that is, I--I only meant country dances," [...] says Hetty, biting her lips, as she <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> sister's <b>eye.</b> She remembered she had said Harry was stupid, and Theo's droll humorous glance was her only reminder.|$|R
6000|$|Having {{replied in}} those terms, {{she seemed to}} be anxious to get away. The parasol <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> [...] "Miss Kitty wants this," [...] she said, [...] "and wonders why you have not gone back to her in the garden. May I take the parasol?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{second letter}} {{which she had}} laid aside and {{forgotten}} was the first object that <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> on changing her place. She opened it immediately, and, not recognizing the handwriting, looked at the signature. To her unutterable astonishment, her correspondent proved to be no less a person than--old Mr. Clare! ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{she became}} aware of the evening {{newspaper}} Miss Alimony had been reading. The headline, [...] "Suffrage Raid on Regent Street," [...] <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> A queer little idea came into her head. It grew with tremendous rapidity. She put out a hand and took up the paper and read.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps Lady Martindale <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> aunt's <b>eye,</b> for {{she began}} to qualify her praise. 'But, Arthur, excuse me, if I tell you all. There is nothing amiss in her manners, but they are quite unformed, and I should dread any contact with her family.' ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Percival {{looked at}} me sharply, {{as if he was}} about to say something. But at the same moment, Madame Fosco {{attracted}} his attention by rising from her chair. She had <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> husband's <b>eye,</b> and had evidently received her orders to leave the room.|$|R
6000|$|The {{garden was}} blight with sunshine, and the bride was bright with good-humor. She <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> uncle's <b>eye,</b> looking at <b>her</b> admiringly, and paid {{him a little}} {{compliment}} in return. [...] "You have no idea," [...] she said, [...] "how nice {{it is to be}} back at Ham Farm!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{put that}} mouse in my desk?" [...] said Anne. Her voice was quite low {{but it made}} a shiver {{go up and down}} Paul Irving's spine. Joe Sloane <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> felt {{responsible}} from the crown of his head to the sole of his feet, but stuttered out wildly, ...|$|E
60|$|Wilton {{really was}} elated at this. The {{construction}} {{he put on}} {{it was that she}} had relented and was coming back to fling her arms round his neck. He was just bracing himself for the clash, when he <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> and it was as cold and unfriendly as the sea.|$|E
6000|$|Pausing {{a moment}} to collect herself, Christie recollected {{that she had not}} asked the name of the new friend whose help she was about to ask. A little sign on the door <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> and, bending down, she managed to read by the dim light of the street lamp these words: ...|$|E
60|$|It {{often seemed}} to Virginia when she <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>eyes</b> upon <b>her</b> {{that there was}} a gleam of dislike in them, as though he would have been glad to have been rid of her that she might not in any way embarrass or {{interfere}} with his work.|$|R
60|$|Occasionally {{she came}} to a spot where {{independent}} worlds of ephemerons were passing their time in mad carousal, some in the air, some on the hot ground and vegetation, some in the tepid and stringy water of a nearly dried pool. All the shallower ponds had decreased to a vaporous mud amid which the maggoty shapes of innumerable obscure creatures could be indistinctly seen, heaving and wallowing with enjoyment. Being a woman not disinclined to philosophize she sometimes sat down under her umbrella to rest and to watch their happiness, for a certain hopefulness as to the result of her visit gave ease to her mind, and between important thoughts left it free to dwell on any infinitesimal matter which <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|One {{night in}} July,--'twas {{the very day}} Mr. Carvel had spoken to me of Grafton,--I had ridden over to Wilmot House to supper. I had little heart for going, but good Mrs. Manners herself had made me promise, and I could: not break my word. I must have sat very silent and preoccupied at the table, where all was wit and merriment. And more than once I saw the {{laughter}} leave Dorothy's face, and <b>caught</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> upon; me with such a look as set my beast throbbing. They would not meet my own, but would turn away instantly. I was heavy indeed that night, and did not follow the company into the ballroom, but made my excuses to Mrs. Manners.|$|R
