40|$|Sleep {{is a very}} {{important}} part of life, as it ensures that the body is renewed and thus enables human existence. Especially in children, it is important to give them rest, which is needed for healthy development and growth. Quantity of sleep that we need depends on each person; however, it also varies with age. The rhythm of sleep and wakefulness in infants exchanges on a few hours. Those periods are getting longer with age, however, it depends on individual child, when he/she will cancel sleeping during the day and sleep at night only. In the past, sleeping in kindergarten was mandatory for all children and the time for rest was very strictly specified. The Curriculum for kindergartens (1999) suggests the rest time in kindergarten should be based on child's individual needs and wishes. Recent researches in this area show that the children, even those who no longer need the sleep during the day, in most kindergartens, still have to lie on the <b>carry-cots</b> at least for some of the time during the rest. In a study, which I made with children from oldest departments of kindergarten, first grade pupils and parents, I was interested in how the rest in kindergarten is organized today, and how this part of the daily routine is viewed by children and their parents. I found that both, children in kindergartens as well as first grade pupils do not like the fact that they must lie on <b>carry-cots,</b> even if not falling asleep, and that, instead, they want more games. Most parents surveyed were satisfied with the organization of rest in kindergarten, despite the fact that their children do not always sleep. The results of the research have shown that this area still needs improvement to adjust the rest time to children's needs. ...|$|R
50|$|Adrian Vernon Fish {{was born}} in Bristol, the only son of Harold Alfred Christopher Fish and Freda Jagger. Both his parents were deeply {{involved}} in local amateur operatic societies, and Adrian was taken in his <b>carry-cot</b> to many rehearsals and performances. At the age of four, {{he was allowed to}} stand backstage at a performance of Gilbert and Sullivan’s The Gondoliers. It was at that event that Fish determined to become a composer. Fish started piano lessons with Gwyneth Maine shortly after starting school at Westbury-on-Trym Church of England Primary School in Bristol. At the age of seven, he won an award in the Bristol Eisteddfod. At the age of ten, Fish was sent as a boarder to Queen Elizabeth’s Hospital, Bristol’s famed “Bluecoat” school, on a foundation scholarship. There was no music making at the school, except for an elderly piano teacher who visited once a week to give lessons. At age eleven, Fish found himself appointed school organist. The first hymn he had to play on the school’s old organ was “Judge Eternal, throned in splendour,” to the tune Rhuddlan. He remained school organist until he left at age seventeen.|$|E
40|$|This report gives a {{complete}} {{overview of the}} work of tno-iw on the program package "madymo" for crash injury prevention research, since the start in 1973. The aim of this project is the development of a highly versatile program package for 2 - and 3 -dimensional simulations of traffic accidents, ultimately stimulating prevention of injury. Examples are a restrained vehicle occupant, a car that hits a pedestrian, and a <b>carry-cot</b> with a baby on the back seat. the first part gives a comparison of mathematical and experimental simulations, explains the choice of a general program package and the reasons for the approach developed by tno. this part briefly describes "madymo", together with some examples. The middle part deals with the mathematical background. It gives details on lagrange's technique, the integration techniques of runge kutta and hammings, and the methods for calculation of the external forces. The last part gives examples of five different simulations, thus showing the versatility of the "madymo" program. It also shows how the results of the simulations are presented.
