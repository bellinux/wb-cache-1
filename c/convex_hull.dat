5|$|The curve-shortening flow, {{and many}} of the results about the curve-shortening flow, can be {{generalized}} from the Euclidean plane to any two-dimensional Riemannian manifold. In order to avoid additional types of singularity, {{it is important for the}} manifold to be convex at infinity; this is defined to mean that every compact set has a compact <b>convex</b> <b>hull,</b> as defined using geodesic convexity. The curve-shortening flow cannot cause a curve to depart from its <b>convex</b> <b>hull,</b> so this condition prevents parts of the curve from reaching the boundary of the manifold.|$|E
5|$|Later, von Neumann {{suggested}} a new method of linear programming, using the homogeneous linear system of Gordan (1873), which was later popularized by Karmarkar's algorithm. Von Neumann's method used a pivoting algorithm between simplices, with the pivoting decision {{determined by a}} nonnegative least squares subproblem with a convexity constraint (projecting the zero-vector onto the <b>convex</b> <b>hull</b> of the active simplex). Von Neumann's algorithm was the first interior point method of linear programming.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, the Scottish {{shipbuilder}} John Elder {{published an}} article that advocated that widening the beam of a ship would reduce the area {{that needed to be}} protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship. In addition such a ship would have a shallower draught and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the speed of a normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat-bottomed, unlike Elder's <b>convex</b> <b>hull,</b> to minimise its draught.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{recently}} proposed variant of the Support Vector machine (SVM) algorithm, known as -SVM, {{can be interpreted as}} a maximal separation between subsets of the <b>convex</b> <b>hulls</b> of the data, which we call soft <b>convex</b> <b>hulls.</b> The soft <b>convex</b> <b>hulls</b> are controlled by choice of the parameter. If the intersection of the <b>convex</b> <b>hulls</b> is empty, the hyperplane is positioned halfway between them such that the distance between <b>convex</b> <b>hulls,</b> measured along the normal, is maximized; and if it is not, the hyperplane's normal is similarly determined by the soft <b>convex</b> <b>hulls,</b> but its position (perpendicular distance from the origin) is adjusted to minimize the error sum. The proposed geometric interpretation of -SVM also leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a choice of for which the -SVM solution is nontrivial. 1 Introduction Recently, Scholkopf et al.

50|$|The {{standard}} &Omega;(n log n) {{lower bound}} for sorting is proven {{in the decision}} tree model of computing, in which only numerical comparisons but not arithmetic operations can be performed; however, in this model, <b>convex</b> <b>hulls</b> cannot be computed at all. Sorting also requires &Omega;(n log n) time in the algebraic decision tree model of computation, a model that is more suitable for <b>convex</b> <b>hulls,</b> and in this model <b>convex</b> <b>hulls</b> also require &Omega;(n log n) time. However, in models of computer arithmetic that allow numbers to be sorted more quickly than O(n log n) time, for instance by using integer sorting algorithms, planar <b>convex</b> <b>hulls</b> can also be computed more quickly: the Graham scan algorithm for <b>convex</b> <b>hulls</b> consists of a single sorting step followed by a linear amount of additional work.|$|R
5|$|The {{concept of}} a dual {{tessellation}} can also be applied to partitions of the plane into finitely many regions. It {{is closely related to}} but not quite the same as planar graph duality in this case. For instance, the Voronoi diagram of a finite set of point sites is a partition of the plane into polygons within which one site is closer than any other. The sites on the <b>convex</b> <b>hull</b> of the input give rise to unbounded Voronoi polygons, two of whose sides are infinite rays rather than finite line segments. The dual of this diagram is the Delaunay triangulation of the input, a planar graph that connects two sites by an edge whenever there exists a circle that contains those two sites and no other sites. The edges of the <b>convex</b> <b>hull</b> of the input are also edges of the Delaunay triangulation, but they correspond to rays rather than line segments of the Voronoi diagram. This duality between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations can be turned into a duality between finite graphs in either of two ways: by adding an artificial vertex at infinity to the Voronoi diagram, to serve as the other endpoint for all of its rays, or by treating the bounded part of the Voronoi diagram as the weak dual of the Delaunay triangulation. Although the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation are dual, their embedding in the plane may have additional crossings beyond the crossings of dual pairs of edges. Each vertex of the Delaunay triangle is positioned within its corresponding face of the Voronoi diagram. Each vertex of the Voronoi diagram is positioned at the circumcenter of the corresponding triangle of the Delaunay triangulation, but this point may lie outside its triangle.|$|E
