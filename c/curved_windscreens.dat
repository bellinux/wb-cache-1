5000|$|... #Caption: Bedford CA ambulance. <b>Curved</b> <b>windscreens</b> were {{expensive}} {{in the early}} 1950s, and until 1958 the CA used a [...] "split-screen" [...] windscreen.|$|E
50|$|Smaller (sub 7.5 tonnes) A class {{vehicles}} {{are also popular}} in Europe, similar in size to Overcab Coachbuilts, but without the base vehicles cab. In its place, a (wider) cab is added, which allows for a drop-down bed to be fitted above. Recognisable by their large <b>curved</b> <b>windscreens.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1st series units {{originally}} had <b>curved</b> <b>windscreens,</b> replaced in the 1980s by flat glas, later used on 2nd and 3rd series units. The locomotives have a Bo'Bo' wheel arrangement {{with a maximum}} allowed speed is 130 km/h. Like most FS stock, some D.445 have received the XMPR color scheme (white, green, blue).|$|E
2500|$|... {{of armor}} plate was fitted {{to the cockpit}} and a [...] bullet-resistant glass screen was fitted behind the <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 150 lb {{of armor}} plate was fitted {{to the cockpit}} and a 1.5 in bullet-resistant glass screen was fitted behind the <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Two {{variants}} existed, the Palatine I (known as [...] "Palatine" [...] before 1992) {{which had}} a flatter windscreen, and the Palatine II (launched in 1993) {{which had a}} <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> with an arched top resembling that of the single-decker Northern Counties Paladin.|$|R
50|$|Very early {{types of}} bus {{could still be}} found but no longer in service, with a front engine mounted in an {{extended}} bonneted nose, {{in the style of}} some conventional trucks. The majority of classic Malta buses had elaborate grilles and headlight arrangements, <b>curved</b> <b>windscreens</b> and sloping roofs. Later makes of bus were usually of conventional bus and coach designs that were in use elsewhere in the world, such as Plaxton Supreme and Duple Dominant bodywork.|$|E
50|$|There {{was also}} {{activity}} in the single decker fleet. Some of the AEC Regal IV RFs had been refurbished in the 1960s, with twin headlights, <b>curved</b> <b>windscreens,</b> new side mouldings and improved interiors, mainly allocated to Green Line services. There were 14 Willowbrook bodied AEC Reliances at Hertford garage, which had been bought by London Transport in 1965. By 1975 they were on bus work, which some thought was idiosyncratic when vehicles twice as old were still on Green Line work.|$|E
50|$|The other Northern Counties-bodied Lowlanders {{were those}} {{supplied}} to the South Notts Bus Company of Gotham, Nottinghamshire, who purchased one {{a year from}} 1963 to 1967. South Notts was since 1929 half-owned by the Dabell family and half by major independent bus & coach operator Barton Transport Ltd; Barton had taken Northern Counties bodies on its double deckers since 1957 and in 1960 South Notts had a Northern Counties lowbridge forward-entrance Titan PD3, similar to Barton's contemporary AEC Regents but without the full front and ‘wrap around’ <b>curved</b> <b>windscreens</b> and upper deck windows. Like this and contemporary Barton double deckers, the South Notts Lowlanders had a sliding, air-operated, single-piece entry door; the SBG’s Lowlanders all had folding four-leaf doors to the entrance.|$|E
50|$|In June 1965, the Renault Super Goélette SG2 {{replaced}} the Goélette with new features: wide <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen,</b> {{replacement of the}} sheet metal dashboard, steering wheel shifter, front independent, variable flexibility suspension with coil springs (rear leaf spring suspension in 1967), telescopic shock absorbers and high ground clearance. However, the gasoline engine was a Étendard type.|$|R
50|$|The GT was {{designed}} for the Ford Popular and {{was based on the}} Rochdale F type racing body, but a roof was added to increase the chassis's torsional stiffness (flex) compared to the open ST. The GT was well equipped and came ready-fitted with doors, bonnet, and <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen.</b> From 1960 the car was available with Rochdale's own chassis. About 1350 were made.|$|R
50|$|The Vega Gull {{retained}} the de Havilland Gipsy Six air-cooled inline engine {{introduced in the}} D.3 Gull Six of 1934. Most examples were fitted with the optional DH Gipsy Six Series II engine {{in conjunction with the}} DH-PD30 VP airscrew. The final Mk II examples were fitted with a <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> (the earlier examples had a multi-faceted windscreen of flat panels) similar in appearance to the early marks of the Proctor.|$|R
50|$|Independent {{customers}} for the RU were headed by Lancashire United Transport (LUT) of Atherton who took delivery of fifty over 1970-1. These {{had a special}} version of the Plaxton Derwent II body supplied only to this operator featuring flat rather than <b>curved</b> <b>windscreens,</b> deleting peaks on front and rear domes and having glazing and general appearance similar to Plaxton's previous (1958-66) Highway bus body. They also appear (judging by photographic evidence) to have had front-mounted radiators. As well as being fitted to the fifty RU which were dual-door 40-seaters on short chassis, the same body went on two batches of Bristol RESL6G, twenty B42D in 1967/8 and ten DP41F in 1973/4. Subsequently LUT (and other outliers such as the Calderdale Region of West Yorkshire PTE) were prevailed upon to take the standard version of the Derwent II.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{distinct}} {{designs of}} front end were fitted. The first had two-piece flat windscreens which {{met at a}} slight point in the centre, EL2000-style headlights with separate indicators above, and a shallow, plain bumper. The second (and more common) had a two-piece [...] "barrel" [...] <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> with level top, a slatted grille matching {{the height of the}} headlights, indicators in the headlight surrounds, and a noticeably chunkier bumper. Both windscreen styles had quarterlights.|$|R
50|$|Belron {{was first}} founded {{as a family}} {{business}} in 1897 as Jacobs & Dandor in Cape Town, South Africa. The company was purchased and renamed Plate Glass Bevelling and Silvering in 1899. In 1917, City Glass Bevelling & Silvering Works bought Plate Glass; the companies were merged in 1919 and went ahead to gain success in the windscreen industry by securing the business rights to the <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> production technology in 1953 and introducing laminated rear windows in 1958.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{years later}} Arzens {{came up with}} an {{eye-catching}} and streamlined two seater cabriolet prototype body built around the chassis of an old Buick. The car was christened [...] "La Baleine" [...] (the whale). With its integrated headlights, panoramic <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> (of [...] "plexiglas") and proto-ponton format styling the design anticipated sports cars of the 1950s and 1960s. The car subsequently joined the Bugattis of the Schlumpf Collection at what has become the National Motor Museum in Mulhouse.|$|R
50|$|Design {{features}} included aerodynamic styling {{with the}} headlights faired into the wings and, for the time, a steeply sloped, <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen.</b> The body was of pressed steel, incorporating a box-section chassis, and {{was made for}} Jowett by Briggs Motor Bodies in their Doncaster factory. The suspension used torsion-bars on all wheels (independent at the front) and internal gear-and-pinion steering. PA and PB models had mixed Girling hydraulic brakes at the front and mechanical braking at the rear. Later versions were fully hydraulic.|$|R
50|$|The Y10's most {{important}} design innovation was the vertical tail cut-off, {{characterized by the}} tailgate painted in black satin, regardless of the color chosen for the body. The notable wedge shape of the small body is very aerodynamic (CX 0.31) thanks to the hood, which is inclined towards the <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen,</b> and side windows that were mounted flush with the bodywork, {{as well as the}} absence of drip rails, the recessed door handles and roof tapering slightly toward the back.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{truck had}} a split, flat pane windshield {{which is still}} available for certain versions, although since December 1994 the T600's cab using a <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> {{was added to the}} lineup. Originally it was only for the long Aerocab and also as an option on the daycab, and it only became available for the W900S in 2006. The flat windscreen is not available on the Aerocab or the extended daycab versions. Strangely, Kenworth offers the curved window either as a one-piece or as a two-piece with a divider in the middle. In March 1998 the very comfortable Studio Aerocab model was introduced.|$|R
5000|$|The {{front-end}} styling of the Ace and Aceca reportedly traces back to {{a design}} done by Pinin Farina for AC in the late 1940s. The car is rather light owing to a tubular frame, aluminium engine block and aluminium body panels. Large 16" [...] spoked road wheels and near 50/50 weight distribution allowed exceptional handling on substandard road surfaces. Later Acecas feature front-wheel disc brakes (added in 1957), while all share transverse leaf spring IRS, articulated rear half-axles, worm-gear steering, an optional overdrive on 2nd, 3rd and 4th gears, <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen,</b> and leather-covered bucket seats. The suspension is independent at {{the front and rear}} using transverse leaf springs.|$|R
5000|$|The space {{behind the}} seats had two red {{crocodile}} leather suitcases strapped down with matching straps {{attached to the}} floor. A shallow vanity drawer under the dashboard contained silver accessories, including a hinge-over mirror, a powder compact, a cigarette case, a lighter, and a clothes brush. The car had a radio, a heating and ventilating unit, an internal shutter to block the glass roof panel, detachable rear wheel spats, a washer system for the one-piece <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen,</b> a demister, and a speedometer marked to 120 mph. The headlights and pass lights were faired into the front wings {{in the same manner}} as Blue Clover or the Gold Car.|$|R
2500|$|Dassault {{launched}} the FNX at the 2001 Paris Air Show, {{aiming for a}} 10,500km (5,700nm) range at Mach 0.88 up from the Falcon 900EX 8,300km at Mach 0.84. Its new high-speed wing is 1.86m (6.10ft) wider and with 5° higher wing sweep than the 900 wing, its 20% longer fuselage is keeping the same cabin cross-section but with a new <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen.</b> The trijet have a combined thrust of 18,000lb (80kN) to be provided by Honeywell FX5, a new design, or a Pratt & Whitney Canada PW306 growth version. Based on Honeywell Primus Epic avionics, its EASy cockpit is developed for the Falcon 2000EX and 900EX and controls are fly-by-wire. Scheduled to fly in 2004, first deliveries were planned for mid-2006.|$|R
2500|$|The {{production}} {{version of}} the Panorama, with 41 seats as standard, was introduced at the 1958 Commercial Motor Show, as an addition to the existing range, available in one form only – on underfloor-engined chassis with the entrance ahead of the front axle. In common with the new Consort III and IV, it had a new silver-effect dished oval grill with a chrome flash through the middle, and a <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> with a central division. The original Panorama's short window immediately behind the entrance door was removed and encapsulated into the first bay, and the difference in level between the waistline and the rear window was accommodated by a stylish [...] "kick-up" [...] at the rear. The design then received minor modifications {{over the next two}} years.|$|R

5000|$|The show car, a {{drophead}} coupé {{built on}} chassis number 51223, was painted pastel jade green, {{causing it to}} be named [...] "Green Goddess" [...] by the motoring press. The operation of the hood was electro-hydraulically powered including the metal cover under which the hood was stored when retracted. The side windows in the doors were electrically powered and the raked, <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> had three wipers. The headlights and pass lights were in recesses in the front wings behind Perspex covers held in chrome bezels that were fluted at the top to match the radiator grille. The body had aluminium spats set over the rear wheels with spring balanced arms to move {{them out of the}} way for access to the wheels.|$|R
50|$|The car shared its 10 ft {{wheelbase}} {{with its}} predecessor, the Jaguar Mark VII, which outwardly it closely resembled. However, the interior fittings were more luxurious {{than those of}} the Mark VII. Distinguishing visually between the models is facilitated by changes to the front grille, the driving or fog lamps being moved from the front panel to the horizontal panel between bumper & front panel, larger rear lamps and most obviously a curved chrome trim strip below the waistline which allowed the factory to offer a variety of two-tone paint schemes. In addition the new car had rear spats that were cut back to display more of the rear wheels and featured a one-piece slightly <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen,</b> where the Mark VII had incorporated a two-piece front screen of flat glass.|$|R
50|$|The Dartline was {{unveiled}} by Duple at the 1988 British Motor Show, {{along with the}} Dennis Dart chassis. The first body to be built on the Dart, it was 2.3m wide, and initially offered in just one length, 9m. Its most distinctive feature was its <b>curved,</b> asymmetric <b>windscreen</b> covering the destination sign with an arched top.|$|R
25|$|The M.52's single pilot, who, for the {{intended}} first flight, {{would have been}} test pilot Eric Brown, would have flown the aircraft from a small cockpit which was set inside the shock cone at {{the nose of the}} aircraft. The pressurised cockpit, in which the pilot would have had to fly the aircraft in a semi-prone position, was complete with a <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> that was aligned with the contours of the bullet-shaped nose. In the event of an emergency, the entire section could be jettisoned, the separation from the rest of aircraft being initiated via multiple cordite-based explosive bolts. Air pressure would force the detached capsule off the fuselage while a parachute would slow its descent; during the capsule's descent, the pilot would bail out at a lower altitude and then parachute to safety. In order to serve its role as a research aircraft, the M.52 was to be equipped with comprehensive flight instrumentation, including automated instrument recorders and strain gauging throughout the structure connected to an oscilloscope.|$|R
5000|$|The P.111 {{made its}} first flight on 10 October 1950, at Royal Aircraft Establishment Boscombe Down with Squadron Leader Bob Smyth at the controls. Later test flying {{was carried out by}} the legendary test pilot, Alexander E. [...] "Ben" [...] Gunn, who {{described}} the aeroplane as [...] "touchy" [...] and [...] "like flying a razor's edge". Part of the touchiness was because the power controls, essential at high speeds over 450 mph, lacked any feedback. There was also a large trim change when the undercarriage was raised or lowered and landing speeds were high in the absence of airbrakes and because of the need to keep the engine revs up to maintain the generators which powered the control surfaces. In {{the first few months of}} flying, the controls were spring-loaded to give a semblance of feel and the rudder was altered to manual control. The P.111 initially had a one piece blown and continuously <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen,</b> but this was replaced by a more conventional framed screen with a flat forward pane.|$|R
50|$|The overall {{profile and}} {{architecture}} of the CA changed little during the vehicle's seventeen-year life. There were, however, three distinctly different versions sold. The first CAs featured a two-piece windscreen, comprising two separate flat sheets of glass separated with a central vertical metal divide. As curved screen glass became available in the UK at an acceptable price, the two piece windscreen was replaced with a single slightly <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> in approximately 1958. At {{the same time the}} painted front grille of the original, which had featured a central split reflecting the split windscreen, was replaced by a smaller unsplit front grille, still painted in the van's body colour. The third version of the Bedford CA, sold from late 1964, featured a much deeper windscreen and side windows, and a corresponding reduction in the height of the painted metal scuttle panel directly below the windscreen. The 1964 vans also reflected general trends in car design of the time in featuring, for the first time, a pressed aluminium alloy front grille. The longer wheelbase version had the body lengthened by an additional short roof panel, with wider doors.|$|R
5000|$|In 1958, Plaxtons were {{approached}} by Sheffield United Tours (SUT) with {{a requirement for}} a new crisper design of coach body. The result was the first Panorama body. The main feature of the Panorama design was the large, fixed rectangular side windows. A vertical front from the contemporary Consort II design was used, with the door ahead of the front axle. The 1958 Panorama was entered into the British and the Nice coach rallies, winning top awards at both events. The first six Panoramas, designated [...] "Panorama Pioneer" [...] by SUT, were built on AEC Reliance chassis and seated 36 passengers. The production version of the Panorama, with 41 seats as standard, was introduced at the 1958 Commercial Motor Show, as an addition to the existing range, available in one form only - on underfloor-engined chassis with the entrance ahead of the front axle. In common with the new Consort III and IV, it had a new silver-effect dished oval grill with a chrome flash through the middle, and a <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> with a central division. The original Panorama's short window immediately behind the entrance door was removed and encapsulated into the first bay, and the difference in level between the waistline and the rear window was accommodated by a stylish [...] "kick-up" [...] at the rear. The design then received minor modifications {{over the next two}} years.|$|R
50|$|In October 2007 Optare {{unveiled}} the Solo SR at the Coach & Bus Show. It is a completely-restyled {{version of the}} Solo drawing styling features from the Versa, such as the curved side windows and sweeping roof (with the destination screen and air conditioning unit underneath). Some features of the Solo such as the <b>curved</b> front <b>windscreen</b> and the unusual chassis layout, with the front wheels ahead of the doorway, were retained. Another new unusual feature to the Solo SR {{is the lack of}} a destination box on the standard model. However, Optare do offer this as an option to individual customer specification.|$|R
50|$|The <b>curved</b> and raked <b>windscreen</b> and the {{electrically}} powered semi-elliptical rear quarter-lights {{were made from}} Triplex laminated heat-reflecting safety glass, and the {{electrically powered}} side windows were double glazed. The roof was thermally insulated and had a transparent sun panel fixed toward the front, with a blind underneath the panel to block the light when desired.|$|R
50|$|The D.445 {{represented}} an {{evolution of the}} FS Class D.443 engine, maintaining the predecessor's reliability and operational capabilities. At {{the beginning of the}} 1970s FS, during a plan aimed at the expansion and modernization of current service, designed a new version of an unified diesel engine which could also resolve the issue of supplying power to heat carriages in an efficient way through a high voltage Head end power supply (REC) fed by a secondary generator. Previous diesel locomotives were not provided with this and so required the use of a generator wagon (Carro Riscaldo), leading to increased weight. The first series of locomotives, introduced from 1974, were built with <b>curved</b> front <b>windscreens</b> which would be later replaced by cheaper and sturdier flat ones.|$|R
50|$|The Mk 1 used a 1500 cc MGA or Riley 1.5 litre {{engine in}} a ladder chassis with Elva {{designed}} independent front suspension. The engine was set well {{back in the}} chassis to help weight distribution, which produced good handling but encroached on the cockpit making the car a little cramped. The chassis carried lightweight 2-seater open glassfibre bodywork. It was produced as a complete car for the US and European market and available in kit form for the UK market. After about 50 cars were made it was upgraded to the Mk II which was the same car but fitted with a proprietary <b>curved</b> glass <b>windscreen,</b> replacing the original flat-glass split type, and the larger 1600 cc MGA engine. Approximately 400 of the Mk I and II were made.|$|R
5000|$|The {{final version}} of the Seafire was the Seafire F Mk 47 and FR Mk 47. There was no true prototype, instead the first {{production}} aircraft PS944 and PS945 served as trials aircraft. As the [...] "definitive" [...] carrier based Seafire, the Mk 47 incorporated several refinements over earlier variants. After the first four aircraft, with manually folded wings, the Mk 47 incorporated hydraulically powered wing folding, the outer wings folding upwards in one piece, without the folding wingtips of earlier marks. All Mk 47s adopted the Rotol contra-rotating propellers. The Mk 47 also featured a long supercharger air-duct, the intake of which started just behind the spinner and a modified <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen,</b> similar to that used on the Mk XVII. Other features unique to the Mk 47s were spring-loaded elevator tabs, a large inertia weight in the elevator control system and beading on the trailing edges of the elevators. These changes improved longitudinal stability, especially when the aircraft was fully loaded. The modified windscreen proved to be unpopular with pilots because of continual problems with misting and the thicker, repositioned frames obstructed visibility during deck landings. In spite of recommendations to change the windscreen back to a standard Spitfire 24 unit, this was never done. Performance tests showed that the Mk 47 was slightly slower than the Mk 46 in maximum and climbing speeds, mainly due to the long supercharger air intake, which was less efficient than the shorter type fitted to earlier Seafires. The Seafire 47 saw action with 800 Squadron on board [...] during the Malayan Emergency of 1949 and during the Korean War in 1950. However, in 1951 all Seafires were withdrawn from front-line service. In all 90 F Mk 47s and FR Mk 47s were built, all by Supermarine. VR971, the last of the 22,000 aircraft built under the Spitfire/Seafire program, left the production line at Supermarine on 28 January 1949.|$|R
