5000|$|Cane Corso {{appear in}} two basic coat colours: black and fawn. This is further {{modified}} by genetic pigment dilution to create [...] "blue" [...] (grey, from black) and frumentino or formentino (from fawn, where the mask is blue/grey) colours. Brindling of varying intensity is common on both basic coat colours as well, creating tigrato (black brindle), and Grigio Tigrato (blue brindle). White markings are common on the <b>chest,</b> <b>tips</b> of toes, the chin, and {{the bridge of}} the nose. Large white patches are not desirable.|$|R
5000|$|A {{peripherally}} inserted central catheter, or PICC line (pronounced [...] "pick"), is {{a central}} venous catheter inserted into a vein in the arm (via the basilic or cephalic veins) rather than a vein in the neck or <b>chest.</b> The <b>tip</b> is positioned in the superior vena cava.|$|R
5|$|Variations are {{markedly}} different with each subspecies. The eastern subspecies has more distinct spots on its chest, more white along the tips and retraces and obvious wing bars. T.c. palmeri has less spotting on <b>chest</b> and <b>tips</b> and less obvious wing bars. Other examples include T.c. curvirostre possessing longer wings and a tail than T.c. oberholseri; T.c. insularum is paler with more grey than T.c. palmeri {{and has more}} visible spotting on its breast.|$|R
50|$|The nob of the Finnish Hound is short, {{dense and}} coarse to the touch. The coat pattern is tricolor with tan, a black saddle and small white {{markings}} on head, feet, <b>chest</b> and tail <b>tip.</b> Height is commonly 20-24 inches (52-61 cm) and weight 45-55 pounds (20-25 kg).|$|R
50|$|The coat of the Fila Brasileiro {{is smooth}} and short.Black, Fawns (Red, Apricot, or Dark), and Brindled (Fawn, Black, or Brown Brindle) colors are permitted, except Mouse-Grey, Black and Tan, Blue and Solid White. White markings, not {{exceeding}} 1/4 of the coat surface area, are permitted on the feet, <b>chest,</b> and the <b>tip</b> of the tail in the FCI standard.|$|R
40|$|A 56 -year-old {{man with}} history of {{coronary}} bypass 6  years ago and ICD implantation 5  months ago {{was admitted to}} hospital after hearing a beeping from the ICD. On <b>chest</b> x-ray, the <b>tip</b> of the lead had migrated out of the heart silhouette. Percutaneous lead extraction was performed under close monitoring and fully equipped for pericardiosynthesis and resuscitation with on standby surgical backup. Although right ventricle perforation is a rare complication of pacemaker implants, regardless of the lead fixation mechanism, the possibility of perforation should always be considered...|$|R
50|$|Hubbard {{described}} the breed as {{much like the}} Welsh sheepdog and old working collie types. It worked quietly, quickly and low-to-ground. The head was rather broad and flat, tapering to a medium-length muzzle. The ears fell over to the front or were semi-erect and rather small. The body was fairly long and extremely lithe, with light but muscular legs and a low-set tail carried at the trail. The coat was fairly heavy and quite dense. Cumberland sheepdogs were black with white blaze, <b>chest,</b> feet and <b>tip</b> of tail. Height was about 20 inches and weight ranged 40-50 pounds.|$|R
50|$|The adult {{color is}} {{typically}} a golden-red with variations from pale honey to dark chestnut. There is no {{preference for a}} particular shade {{as long as the}} color is bright and clear with no hints of dullness. The coat should never be a solid color. It should be shaded and without any defined color changes. The coat is usually at its darkest shade {{on the back of the}} dog, gradually getting lighter around the chest and belly. The undercoat must always be lighter in color than the topcoat, but is never allowed to be white. A small patch of white, no more than 0.6 inches (1.5 cm) wide, is allowable on the <b>chest,</b> and white <b>tips</b> on the feet are acceptable, but not desired.|$|R
50|$|Black Mouth Curs have short coats, either coarse or fine, and a {{combination}} of the two types may appear in the same litter. Black Mouth Curs come in many colors. All shades of red, yellow and fawn; black; brown; buckskin; or brindle; with or without black muzzle or mask. Very small amounts of white are allowed under the chin, around the nose, on the neck, <b>chest,</b> legs, and <b>tip</b> of tail, provided that no more than ten percent total of the dog's body may be white. Dilute coat colors are acceptable and may be identified by the following traits: green, yellow, or light brown eyes; white toenails; red or yellow coat without any trace of black hair. Never spotted, mottled, merle, or with white collar. A disqualification is albinism.|$|R
50|$|Like other farm dogs {{raised for}} work {{rather than for}} pets or show, the {{appearance}} can vary a great deal, {{although there is a}} definite breed standard. In general, the Austrian Pinscher is a normally proportioned strong and sturdy dog, 33 - 48 cm (13 - 19 inches) at the withers. The breed has button ears and a head described as being shaped like a pear. The double coat is short to medium long, in a variety of yellow, red or black and tan colours, usually with white markings on the face, <b>chest,</b> feet and <b>tip</b> of the tail. The long tail is held high, and dogs of this breed should look lively and alert. They are heavier, more rugged and rectangular in appearance than the German Pinscher.|$|R
50|$|Pups {{are born}} with a dark {{chocolate}} brown pelt with gold flecks and reddish tinges, which changes to light brown {{by the age of}} six weeks. Adult coloration occurs around four months of age. For adult dogs, the colors brown, black and tan have been reported, all with white points. The sides of the neck and zonal stripes behind the scapula are golden. Black and very dark guard hair is generally lightly allocated over the hair of the spine, concentrating {{on the back of the}} ears and the surface of the tail over the white tip. The muzzle is always black on young dogs. Generally, all colors have white markings underneath the chin, on the paws, <b>chest</b> and tail <b>tip.</b> About one third also have white markings on the muzzle, face and neck. By 7 years, the black muzzle begins to turn gray.|$|R
5|$|The plumage of {{an adult}} bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is {{moderately}} long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism {{is evident in the}} species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related African fish eagle (H. vocifer) (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white <b>chest</b> and black <b>tip</b> to the bill.|$|R
50|$|Basenjis are small, {{short-haired}} {{dogs with}} erect ears, tightly curled tails and graceful necks. A Basenji's forehead is wrinkled, {{even more so}} when they are young or extremely excited. A Basenji's eyes are typically almond-shaped. Basenjis typically weigh about 20 - 24 lb and stand 16- 18 in at the shoulder. They are a square breed, which means they are {{as long as they}} are tall with males usually larger than females. Basenjis are athletic dogs, and deceptively powerful for their size. They have a graceful, confident gait like a trotting horse, and skim the ground in a double suspension gallop, with their characteristic curled tail straightened out for greater balance when running at their top speed. Basenjis come in a few different colorations: red, black, tricolor, and brindle, and they all have white feet, <b>chests</b> and tail <b>tips.</b> They can also come in trindle, which is a tricolor with brindle points, a rare combination.|$|R

5000|$|Height: 17-24 inches (45-61 cm.)Weight: 30-65pounds (15-20 kg.) The {{ears are}} {{characteristic}} and are erect, very long, and moderately slender, tapering {{way up to}} elegantly pointed tips {{and they can be}} individually turned to the direction of any sound, providing extremely sensitive hearing. The dog ranges in build from muscular yet slender and graceful to somewhat stockier animals. The dogs legs are also graceful but strong. The hind midsection is firm and narrow. The overall build in a healthy, properly fed Carolina Dog is svelte to somewhat stockier, strong and athletic. Paws are relatively large and the snout and even the notably elongated, fox-like ears are nevertheless characteristically Spitz-like. The tail is most often upturned and often has a characteristic slight or pronounced shape called a 'fish hook' by some experts and owners. The coat is most commonly short and smooth, characteristic of a warm climate canid. Carolina Dogs are a medium sized dog, that come in varying shades of reddish ginger, buff, fawn, black and tan or piebald with or without white areas on toes, <b>chest,</b> tail <b>tip</b> and muzzle. The eyes are at an oblique angle and almond shaped. The eyes vary in color, but are usually dark brown or medium to dark orange. The area along the edges of the eyes is often (but not always) a distinctive black [...] "eyeliner" [...] coloration which becomes more pronounced by contrast in lighter colored dogs. The lips are often black, even in light colored dogs. Frequently puppies have a melanistic mask that usually fades as the adult coat comes in.|$|R

It {{is an alternative}} tip confirmation method to fluoroscopy or chest X-ray for PICC tip insertion confirmation in adults. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate time and cost of the Sherlock 3 CG TCS and blind insertion with <b>chest</b> X-ray <b>tip</b> confirmation (BI/CXR) for PICC insertions. Methods: A cross-sectional, observational Time and Motion study was conducted. Data were collected at four hospitals in the US. Two hospitals used Sherlock 3 CG TCS and two hospitals used BI/CXR to place/confirm successful PICC tip location. Researchers observed PICC insertions, collecting data from the beginning (ie, PICC kit opening) to catheter tip confirmation (ie, released for intravenous [IV] therapy). An economic model was developed to project outcomes for a larger population. Results: A total of 120 subjects were enrolled, with 60 subjects enrolled in each arm and 30 enrolled at each of the four US hospitals. The mean time from initiation of the PICC procedure to the time to release for IV therapy was 33. 93  minutes in the Sherlock 3 CG arm and 176. 32  minutes in the BI/CXR arm (p < 0. 001). No malpositions were observed for PICC insertions using the Sherlock 3 CG TCS, while 20 % of subjects in the BI/CXR arm had a malposition. BI/CXR subjects had significantly more total malpositions (mean 0. 23 vs. 0, p < 0. 001). For a hypothetical population of 1, 000 annual patients, adoption of Sherlock 3 CG TCS was predicted to be cost saving compared with BI/CXR in all three analysis years. Conclusion: The results from this study demonstrate that Sherlock 3 CG TCS, when compared with BI/CXR, is a superior alternative with regard to time to release subject to therapy, malposition rates, and minimization of X-ray exposure.

40|$|Background: As a rule, central venous {{catheters}} (CVC) {{should not}} be positioned in the right atrium (RA) to avoid the risk of perforation and cardiac tamponade. However, in ICUs where ECG monitoring can detect any initial damage of the atrial wall, CVCs may probably be safely positioned in the RA. We investigated whether mixed venous saturation (SvO 2) was better estimated by measuring central venous saturation (ScvO 2) in the RA or in the superior vena cava (SVC) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: A CVC and a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) were positioned before surgical coronary revascularization in sixty patients. Under transesophageal echocardiographic guidance, CVC tips were randomly positioned inside the RA (group A) or the SVC (group C). In each patient, eight pairs of blood samples were collected from CVC and PAC distal ports and saturation measured. Cardiac arrhythmias {{that occurred in the}} first 48 postoperative hours and CVC <b>tip</b> position on <b>chest</b> X-rays were also registered. Results: ScvO 2 and SvO 2 correlated better in group A (r= 0. 95) than in group C (r= 0. 84). The 95 % interval of confidence of the gap between ScvO 2 and SvO 2 was narrower in group A (- 6. 9 /+ 3. 2 vs. - 11. 6 /+ 5. 5; p<. 01). The incidence of arrhythmias was equal in the two groups (16. 7 %). On <b>chest</b> X-rays, CVC <b>tips</b> were 5. 4 (SD= 3. 6) cm below the tracheal carina in group A and 5. 3 (SD= 3. 9) cm in group C. Conclusion: In monitored patients, positioning CVC tips in the RA rather than in the SVC may allow closer estimates of SvO 2 and may be safe. Yet, safety should be confirmed by further studies with larger samples of patients...|$|R
