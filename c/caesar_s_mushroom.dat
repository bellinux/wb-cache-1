40|$|While {{technically}} {{considered as}} fungi, mushrooms are often classified as vegetables {{because they provide}} many of the nutritional attributes of produce as well as meat, beans, and grains. The U. S. is the largest consumer of mushrooms and the share of imports in total consumption of mushrooms has been rising and will likely continue to rise as U. S. consumers increasingly adopt healthier diets. While most of U. <b>S.</b> fresh <b>mushroom</b> imports are from Canada, China, Mexico and South Korea, most of U. <b>S.</b> canned <b>mushroom</b> imports are from China, India, Indonesia, and the Netherlands. The contribution of this thesis is to provide the first-ever estimates of import demand elasticities for fresh and canned mushrooms {{during the period of}} 2002 - 2015 by 1) first using a source-differentiated Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) model and a source-differentiated Rotterdam model; and 2) selecting between the two models based on two specification tests. Several findings and implications are in order. First, demand for Canadian fresh mushrooms is more inelastic than demand for Chinese canned mushrooms. This means that while Canada, the leading exporter of fresh mushrooms, may gain more revenue from rising mushroom prices; China, the leading exporter of canned mushrooms, may lose. Second, the expenditure elasticity of fresh mushroom imports from Canada is inelastic and the expenditure elasticity of canned mushroom imports from China is elastic. This means that Chinese exporters stand to gain more than Canadian exporters from rising U. <b>S.</b> spending on <b>mushrooms.</b> Advisor: Azzeddine Azza...|$|R

40|$|Sverris Saga and the {{classical}} martial influences This thesis investigates the influences that classical Latin works had upon the martial depictions in Sverris saga. The {{works of the}} Latin authors; Sallust, Lucan and Julius Caesar are investigated and shown how these works affect {{the way that the}} characters of King Sverrir and his contemporise are depicted in the saga. These influences or topoi include pre and post-battle speeches, depictions of individual bravery and military tactics as constantly depicted in the saga. 	The investigation starts with a detailed look at the stated classical sources, seemingly available to the compiler/author of Sverris saga. The Icelandic translation of the works of Sallust and Lucan, the Rómverja saga is investigated closely. The provenance and date of the original Latin version of the manuscript used in the translation of the Rómverja saga is suggested. The hypothesis, which is based on that of Þorbörg Helgasdóttir, is that the original manuscript came from western Germany. The suggested provenance of the manuscript from a Benedictine monastery in western Germany suggests a closer connection to the Benedictine monasteries of northern Iceland. The eldest surviving manuscript of the Rómverja saga has also been linked to the hand of a scribe known by the survival of his works in the northern Icelandic Benedictine houses. 	The provenance of a Latin manuscript containing all five of <b>Caesar</b> <b>s</b> Commentaries that could have been copied and brought to Iceland is also shown. This manuscript is from the same period and location that Þorbörg Helgasdóttir maintained, that the Sallust manuscript originated from, Trier in western Germany. <b>Caesar</b> <b>s</b> Commentaries as a source for topoi on the martial aspects of Sverris saga is also briefly examined. The state of Sverris saga and the description of the surviving manuscripts are than detailed. 	The majority of the thesis is concentrated upon showing how the influences or topoi from Sallust, Lucan and Caesar affected the representation of the martial aspects of the warriors in Sverris saga. This influence is shown by extensive comparisons between passages from Sallust and Caesar Commentaries with those contained in Sverris saga. The many passages and topoi that seem to come originate from these classical sources that are present in Sverris saga, seem to suggest an extensive knowledge of these works by the compiler/author of the saga. The presentation of this extensive evidence on classical martial influences upon Sverris saga is displayed {{in a way that is}} clear and concise and hopefully this will provoke further discussion on the saga...|$|R

Spent mushroom substrate has the potential to improve soil structure and provide nutrients when tilled into the soil as an amendment to a planting bed or when used as a topdressing mulch during landscape establishment (Guo 2004). The research objective was to determine the effectiveness of SMS for use in landscaping as a soil amendment or as a topdressing. This study observed plant growth and health in four landscape plants over the course of one growing season. The effect of incorporating and topdressing with SMS and the effect of tilling on successful plant establishment on two species of woody shrubs and two species of perennials were measured. This study concluded that SMS is as effective as using fertilizer without tilling the soil but has the added benefits of adding organic matter to the soil, preventing soil borne pathogens, improving soil structure, maintaining or increasing pH, increasing cation exchange capacity, and reusing organic waste. SMS should be used with caution, however, to avoid excessive levels of phosphorus and soluble salts. Natural Resource Managemen...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture {{remains one}} of the top {{industries}} in Hawaii. To strengthen both this industry and Hawaii's overall economic situation, there has been a committed effort to diversify Hawaii's agriculture. As plantation agriculture (sugarcane and pineapple) have declined tremendously, there is a great opportunity for small, diversified agriculture in the state. The U. <b>S.</b> <b>mushroom</b> industry is of substantial value, producing over $ 889 million dollars of fresh mushrooms in the 2002 - 2003 season (USDA 2003). However, there are very few producers of edible mushrooms in Hawaii. Substrate is a key component in mushroom cultivation. First, the substrate must be suitable for the growth and fruiting of the fungus. Second, the substrate should be available locally in sustainable quantities and at low cost. Climate is another factor in successful mushroom cultivation. The majority of mushroom operations in the United States are indoor operations, which allow for precise climate control. Such operations are generally extremely expensive to establish and operate (Shen et al. 2004). High investment costs can be prohibitive to many farmers, especially small farmers or those interested in producing mushrooms as an additional crop. Outdoor cultivation methods, used primarily in China and many other countries, are far less costly but produce relatively lower yields (Shen et al. 2004). In the end, production must be economically feasible for farmers in Hawaii. Significance: With agriculture as one of Hawaii's major industries, the availability of substrate for mushroom cultivation is promising. Many of the common edible mushrooms can be grown on plant derived materials such as wood, straw and various agricultural wastes. On the Island of Hawaii, a great deal of former sugarcane land has been shifted to timber forests. Approximately 11, 740 hectares of land on the Big Island have or will be planted using Eucalyptus grandis for short rotation forests and Acacia koa for long rotation (Martin et al. 2001). There is a definite potential for thinned trees to serve as a local and sustainable source of substrate for mushroom cultivation in Hawaii. There are also a number of fast growing tree species that have been introduced to the islands for various reasons. Whether they are growing wild or intentionally farmed, wood from rapidly growing trees is a potential substrate. The tropical climate of Hawaii, the east coast of the Big Island in particular, provides a wet, humid environment with an average precipitation rate of 3, 404 mm annually (NOAA 2004). It also offers a long growing season, uninterrupted by a harsh winter season. With natural environmental conditions conducive to mushrooms, outdoor cultivation may be a feasible option in Hawaii...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the spread of}} literacy and the written word in the late Roman Republic 63 - 43 BCE; given both the vibrancy of the political scene and the relative abundance of the contemporary sources, the late Republic is an ideal period for investigating the role the written word played for the average Roman citizen. In his ground-breaking Ancient Literacy (London, 1989), William V. Harris argues that the Roman world largely lacked the societal infrastructure that has otherwise encouraged widespread literacy, leading him to estimate that at most 15 % of the population could read or write in the late Republic. On this basis, I reviewed the foundations of Roman written culture (writing materials, the system of education, and the uses and proliferation of the written word), noted some objections to the 15 % estimate, and concluded that assessing the general level of literacy is an inherently subjective task. Instead, I investigated how written and oral forms of communication might have spread the written word to a wider segment of the population. And the over-all conclusion is that we must differentiate between the reading and writing aspects of Roman literacy. With regard to writing, we may delineate a three-tiered stratification of Roman society: the thoroughly literate upper classes; {{a certain percentage of}} the common population (10 %? 25 %? 40 %?) that to a much lesser degree used writing in their daily lives; and, finally, the illiterate commoners (perhaps the majority of the population), who did not actively use the written word. However, the inability to read would not have excluded illiterates from receiving the contents of the written word. Public oratory spread a basic knowledge of elements from upper class written culture (history and law in particular), to the extent that orators could rhetorically use such elements - in moderated form - when trying to persuade the citizens at a popular assembly. Public inscriptions, graffiti, and postings were commonly read out loud, so that random bystanders would have heard their contents, and even otherwise exclusive texts (such as official dispatches and records) were often revealed at public meetings or in the course of trials. Even literary works were at times disseminated to the general public through e. g. public posting and recitals, at least those works that could be exploited for political purposes (such as <b>Caesar</b> <b>s</b> De Bello Gallico). In addition, the evidence from the late Republic refutes the commonly held notion that Latin poetry would automatically have fallen on deaf ears in the general populace - and this in turn opens for the possibility that even some non-political literary works might have found a wider audience. In sum, my overall hypothesis is that 1) the written culture of the upper classes set the tone for public life in Rome, and, 2) the interaction between written and oral forms of communication enabled a more widespread dissemination of this culture...|$|R

40|$|The {{conceptions of}} Julius Caesar in the English Renaissance were complex and contradictory, {{and the four}} {{surviving}} plays about Caesar from the period [...] the anonymous Caesar 2 ̆ 7 s Revenge (c. 1595), Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Julius <b>Caesar</b> (1599), George Chapman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Caesar</b> and Pompey (c. 1604), and Sir William Alexander 2 ̆ 7 s The Tragedy of Julius Caesar (1607) [...] negotiate these conceptions in distinct ways. The views of Caesar current in the Renaissance were diverse in both their sources and content. The medieval tradition glorified Caesar, but classical sources were mixed in their assessments. Caesar was lauded for his virtues and the authoritarian stability he brought to Rome, but was also condemned for his vices and his subversion of the Republic. In the Renaissance, therefore, Caesar was an ambiguous figure who was regarded as both an ambitious usurper and as a legitimate monarch. ^ Renaissance drama imposed didactic lessons on historical subject matter, and, thus, Caesar 2 ̆ 7 s Revenge illustrates how ambition and revenge cause civil discord. Caesar and Pompey espouses Stoic independence, and The Tragedy of Julius Caesar both condemns ambition and counsels Stoic transcendence of the vagaries of Fortune. The three plays, however, cannot simplify Caesar and the events {{of his life to}} fully complement their didactic aims because of two primary factors. First, the plays were composed within disciplinary paradigms that promote ambiguity. These paradigms [...] historiographical in Caesar 2 ̆ 7 s Revenge, philosophical in Caesar and Pompey, and rhetorical in The Tragedy of Julius Caesar [...] resist reductive, didactic appropriations of Caesar by acknowledging opposing viewpoints and perspectives. Secondly, the multiple and conflicting conceptions of Caesar in the Renaissance defied simplification. The number of accounts of Caesar and their contradictory nature produced an intertextual web of references and interpretations that undermined unequivocal portrayals of Caesar. ^ Shakespeare avoided these difficulties by focusing Julius Caesar on ambiguity itself. His play demonstrates the manner in which assessments and judgments of character are the product of the perceiver 2 ̆ 7 s perspective and how identity is thus shaped to appeal to the perceived judgments of those perceivers. These insights are applicable to the operations, specific to the Renaissance, of the other three plays, and to the means of interpretation today. ...|$|R

Second-year student Sonali Garg was named Best Oralist out of over 360 international competitors at the 2004 Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition, the world’s largest international moot court competition. In addition, second-year students Kimberly D. Grant and Amelia A. Godfrey finished well in the best oralist competition, placing 27 th and 65 th, respectively. The team, also including second-year student John C. Marler, {{finished in the top}} 24 out of 94 teams after being defeated by Harvard University. Moot court teams from numerous countries including India, England, Germany and Argentina advanced to this prestigious competition after successfully capturing regional and national titles earlier this spring. Georgia Law Director of Advocacy Kellie R. Casey said, “We are so proud to have our advocacy team members among the best oralists not only in the nation, but also in the entire world. This is a wonderful way to end a successful and memorable season. ” Third-year student Dawn <b>S.</b> <b>Caesar</b> coached the team, while third-year student J. Brian Edwards was the team’s brief editor. In addition, Georgia Law finished strong in the 2004 Intrastate Moot Court Competition, capturing all three first place awards. Two teams represented each of the state’s four accredited law schools. Other universities participating in the tournament were Emory, Georgia State and Mercer. The law school’s winning team was comprised of second-year students Melissa Cook, Beth F. Morris and Brian P. Watt. Third-year students Trinity M. Hundredmark and Jeff P. Shiver served as the team’s coaches. The team captured the Best Brief Award, and Watt was chosen as the best oralist. This marks the fourth consecutive year that Georgia Law has won the statewide competition and had a student named best oralist. After watching the success of the school’s seasoned advocacy competitors, future Georgia Law advocates recently had an opportunity to compete in the 2004 Russell Moot Court Competition, an internal moot court competition for first-year law students. Two finalists presented oral arguments before a panel of legal experts. The jury was comprised mostly of sitting judges, including two justices of Georgia’s Supreme Court. They decided in favor of the defendant, represented by Meredith A. Stein. The plaintiff was represented by Jason T. Burnette. The jury panel consisted of Georgia Supreme Court justices George H. Carley and P. Harris Hines, Georgia Court of Appeals Judge J. D. Smith, Cobb County Superior Court Judge Mary E. Staley and UGA Associate Provost Jere W. Morehead. Sixty-four first-year students participated in this year’s competition. Competitors reaching the Alumni Round of Eight will be invited to join the Georgia Law Moot Court Team, and the top two advocates advanced to the final round that was held April 2. These competitions complete the 2003 - 04 advocacy season for Georgia Law. In total, the law school won five first place oralist trophies, placed second in two national competitions and captured three regional/state championships in addition to numerous other individual and teams honors. #...|$|R
