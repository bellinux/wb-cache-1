Recently, China has {{encountered}} significant challenges in improving, {{on a large}} scale, the environmental performance of its industries, which puts great threat to energy conservation and human health. As one of the State-owned Key Enterprises, to check and reduce negative environmental impacts throughout the subsidiary companies ’ production processes, pollutant emission audit is conducted, which will find total mass of discharged pollutant and weaknesses in the enterprises ’ environmental management.

A company benefiting from market development strategy can acquire a significant market share of current products and services through market saturation and market penetration, and create new markets for current products and services (Khorshidi and Moghaddami 2002). Audit firms also, can use the same strategy {{to improve the quality}} of services provided and expand the market of their respective activities as well. The relationship between audit firms and clients is a kind of agreement, in terms of marketing concepts, that happens within a period of time.

40|$|Background: Measurement of hand hygiene (HH), {{crucial for}} patient safety, has {{acknowledged}} flaws stemming from methods available. Even direct observation, the World Health Organization gold standard, {{may lead to}} behaviour changes which can affect outcome validity. However, it remains important to understand current levels of HH to allow targeted interventions to be developed. This has resulted in wider adoption of auditing processes. Aim: This study addressed how healthcare professionals perceive data generated by HH auditing processes. Methods: Qualitative study involving participatory observation and semi-structured interviews with 30 healthcare professionals recruited from a large National Health Service (NHS) two-hospital site in England. Findings: Healthcare professionals perceived two main problems with HH measurement, both associated with feedback: (1) lack of clarity with regard to feedback; and (2) lack of association between training and measurement. In addition, concerns about data accuracy led {{the majority of participants}} (22 / 30) to <b>conclude</b> <b>audit</b> feedback is often ‘meaningless’. Conclusion: Healthcare professionals require meaningful data on compliance with HH to engender change, as part of a multimodal strategy. Currently healthcare professionals perceive that data lack meaning, and are not seen as drivers to improve HH performance. Potential opportunities to change practice and improve HH are being missed...|$|R

40|$|Does the {{disclosure}} of information about corrupt activities induce a sustained reduction in corruption? We use longitudinal data on audits of municipal governments in Puerto Rico to answer this question. We find that corruption is lower in municipalities audited before an election. However, these municipalities do not exhibit decreased levels of corruption in subsequent audits. Mayors in municipalities audited preceding the previous election have higher re-election rates, suggesting that audits enable voters to select more competent politicians. We present a political agency model that rationalizes the observed short-term and dynamic effects of information on corruption and re-election rates.

We examine the role of the audit committee and ownership concentration in preventing earnings management using Chinese firms listed in Hong Kong.

We <b>conclude</b> that <b>audit</b> committee activity {{is an important factor in}} constraining the propensity of managers to engage in earnings management. In contrast, we find that the size of the audit committee is associated with increased levels of abnormal accruals and suggest that increasing the size of the audit committee creates information asymmetry between the audit committee and management that reduces the monitoring capacity of the audit committee. We do not find any association between audit committee independence, financial and industry experience, or ownership concentration and abnormal accruals. No Full Tex...|$|R

It gives feedback about the HR functions to operating managers and HR specialists. It also provides feedback about how well managers are meeting their HR duties.

Evaluation of an HR function is useful to justify the existence of the department and the expenses incurred on it. If the department fails to contribute to the company’s bottom line, it has no reason to function.
