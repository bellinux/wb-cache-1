30|$|A TWT {{consists}} of an electron source, a magnetic focusing system, input and output ports of RF wave, slow-wave structure and collector. The slow-wave structure is held by three bars. TWT system is placed in a metal enclosure or ceramic [2]. The proper functioning of TWT depends on the precise balance of dielectric material and metal as well as cleaning of surfaces. In the past, several slow-wave structures to control the RF wave velocity {{in the form of}} a helix [3], <b>contrawound</b> helical [4], and ring-bar [5], ring-loop [6], and folded waveguide [7] and half-ring helical [8] are presented and introduced.|$|E

The two filaments of the antenna {{can be thought}} of as a two-wire transmission line whose resonances are determined by the boundary conditions present at the ends of the line. The CTHA is then approximated by a circular array of vertical loops for certain resonance modes. This structural approximation is used in an analytical approach to estimate the general shape of the radiation pattern of the CTHA for these cases. The analytical results are compared with simulation. Relatively good agreement was found, validating the structural approximation for rough pattern estimations.

Radiation resistance is deri�ed for the dipole mode, and results are �alidated by moment-method calculations. The radiation Qs of these antennas are greater than one million, making them unsuitable as dipole mode radiators. Ratios of loop-mode to dipole-mode radiation resistances range from se�eral hundred to large �alues. � 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Microwave Opt Technol Lett 23 : 365 � 368, 1999.
