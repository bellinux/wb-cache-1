5|$|One person <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that 'hero' is a schmaltzy {{piece of}} garbage, but another person {{can write to}} me a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide everyday of my life {{for the last ten}} years until I heard that song and I realized after all I can be my own hero.' And that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, y'know?... It meant something to someone.|$|E
5|$|Makriyannis, {{having been}} ignored by history, and hardly {{mentioned}} by chroniclers of the War of Independence, had {{renewed interest in}} the revolution by offering a significant personal testimony to historical research. Despite this, after the initial interest in the newly published Memoirs, they were hardly cited for almost 40 years. One <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that Makriyannis was forgotten, {{not only as a}} fighter, but also as the author of a text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War of Independence, is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E

60|$|Violet {{thought he}} had exposed himself quite enough; and as dessert was on the table, she rose with as good a smile as she <b>could,</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Very well, I'll explain; you will find {{your way to the}} drawing-room,' and retreated.|$|R
5|$|The {{book was}} not {{intended}} to either present or defend any particular position in environmental ethics, but rather to explore what process philosophers <b>could</b> <b>say</b> or have said about environmental issues. There are, for Palmer, two key problems with a process approach to environmental ethics. The first concerns the value of human and nonhuman life; for process thinkers, the latter will always be trumped by the former in terms of value. The second concerns human perspectives; as process philosophy invariably models interpretation of all entities on human experience, it is not well-suited to characterising non-human nature. Palmer thus concludes that process philosophy does not provide a suitable basis for environmental ethics.|$|E

25|$|Faustine: One <b>could</b> <b>say</b> she is {{the most}} {{ambiguous}} character in the novel or that the fugitive misjudged her the most. She looks like a Gypsy, speaks French like a South American and likes to talk about Canada. She is inspired by silent film star Louise Brooks.|$|E
6000|$|Her father <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> {{that it was}} not. But he <b>could</b> and did <b>say,</b> very sceptically: [...] "Stuff! Now, see here, Agatha: {{what are}} you going to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> Yes, I <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> No. She {{slightly}} {{turned her}} head towards the spot where Rosa Dartle had been standing at her elbow, {{and in that moment}} I said, by the motion of my lips, to Rosa, 'Dead!' ...|$|R

25|$|Actuality is the {{fulfillment}} {{of the end of}} the potentiality. Because the end (telos) is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.|$|E
25|$|The Kouroukan Fouga {{also put}} in place social and {{economic}} reforms including prohibitions on the maltreatment of prisoners and slaves, installing documents between clans which clearly stated who <b>could</b> <b>say</b> what about whom. Also, Sundiata divided the lands amongst the people assuring everyone had {{a place in the}} empire and fixed exchange rates for common products.|$|E
25|$|One <b>could</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} anxious {{search for the}} origins of Life and Mind; the fascination in the 'mysteries of Nature'; the urge to {{penetrate}} and decipher the inner structure of Matter—all these longings and drives denote a sort of nostalgia for the primordial, for the original universal matrix. Matter, Substance, represents the absolute origin, the beginning of all things.|$|E

6000|$|Then Joscelyn Burnett came, and Jordan forgot {{everything}} else. This tall, beautiful woman, in her silken draperies, with a {{face like}} nothing Jordan had ever seen, or even dreamed about,--could this be Aunty Nan's little Joscelyn? Jordan's round, freckled countenance grew crimson. He felt horribly tonguetied and embarrassed. What <b>could</b> he <b>say</b> to her? How <b>could</b> he <b>say</b> it? ...|$|R

25|$|Both Plato and Aristotle {{argue against}} some of Protagoras's claims {{regarding}} relativity; however, {{they argue that the}} concept provides Protagoras with too convenient an exemption from his own theory and that relativism is true for him yet false {{for those who do not}} believe it. They claim that by asserting that truth is relative, Protagoras then <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that whatever further theory he proposed must be true.|$|E
25|$|It's true to {{say these}} {{programmes}} {{about climate change}} are different, in that previously I have made programmes about natural history, and now you <b>could</b> <b>say</b> I have an engaged stance. The first is {{about the fact that}} there is climate change and that it is human-induced. So I'm glad that the BBC wanted some clear statement of the evidence as to why these two things are the case.|$|E
25|$|Dentition is {{particularly}} useful in tracking ancient populations' movements, {{because there are}} differences in the shapes of incisors, the number of grooves on molars, presence/absence of wisdom teeth, and extra cusps on particular teeth. These differences can not only be associated with different populations across space, but also change over time so that the study of the characteristics of teeth <b>could</b> <b>say</b> which population one is dealing with, and at what point in that population's history they are.|$|E

25|$|Sampras did {{not compete}} in any tour {{events in the}} {{following}} 12 months, {{but he did not}} officially announce his retirement until August 2003, just prior to the US Open. He chose not to defend his title there, but his retirement announcement was timed so that he <b>could</b> <b>say</b> farewell at a special ceremony organized for him at the Open. At the time of his retirement, many regarded Sampras as the greatest player of all time.|$|E
25|$|The book, co-authored with Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication, reprints Shannon's 1948 {{article and}} Weaver's popularization of it, which is {{accessible}} to the non-specialist. Warren Weaver {{pointed out that the}} word information in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what you <b>could</b> <b>say.</b> That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the appalling}} {{conditions}} at Theater an der Wien, the opera company leadership {{tried to raise}} significant quantities of money to speed up reconstruction of the original opera house. Many private donations were made, as well as donations of building material from the Soviets, who were {{very interested in the}} rebuilding of the opera. The mayor of Vienna had receptables placed in many sites around Vienna for people to donate coins only. In this way, everyone in Vienna <b>could</b> <b>say</b> they had participated in the reconstruction and feel pride in considering themselves part owners.|$|E

25|$|Laksa lemak, {{also known}} as nyonya laksa (Malay: Laksa nyonya), {{is a type of}} laksa with a rich coconut gravy. Lemak is a culinary {{description}} in the Malay language which specifically refers to the presence of coconut milk which adds a distinctive richness to a dish. As the name implies, it is made with a rich, slightly sweet and strongly spiced coconut gravy. Laksa lemak is usually made with a fish-based gravy (with vegetarian food stalls omitting fish) and quite similar to Thai laksa (Malay: Laksa Thai), perhaps to the point that one <b>could</b> <b>say</b> they are one and the same.|$|E
25|$|It once {{happened}} in that country (and this seems indeed strange) that a living creature {{was caught in the}} forest as to which no one <b>could</b> <b>say</b> definitely whether it was a man or some other animal; for no one could get a word from it or be sure that it understood human speech. It had the human shape, however, in every detail, both as to hands and face and feet; but the entire body was covered with hair as the beasts are, and down the back it had a long coarse mane like that of a horse, which fell to both sides and trailed along the ground when the creature stooped in walking.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{like their}} Olympic counterparts, Soviet rugby players had a fair degree of shamateurism. Both the Olympics and rugby union were officially amateur, {{but this was}} not really the case. For example, the Dinamo clubs were {{sponsored}} and financed by the KGB, but no one <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that openly that some athletes were full-time shamateurs, and received bonuses for winning including dollars. Masters of Sport were full time, and paid by their sports society. They received 180 rubles each year, plus 30-40 rubles if they were capped for the USSR team paid for by the USSR sports committee. There were frequently unofficial bonuses, and some people could be Masters of Sport for life, meaning that they would receive pay long after their retirement.|$|E
