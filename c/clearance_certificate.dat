25|$|The Standards in Public Office Commission {{was asked}} to {{investigate}} the Taoiseach's declaration of tax compliance after the 2002 general election. In mid-January 2008 it emerged in the press, reportedly as leaks from parties to the Mahon tribunal, that Ahern {{would not be in}} a position to present a Tax <b>Clearance</b> <b>Certificate</b> to the Dáil, as required under Ethics' legislation. This certificate is issued by the Revenue Commissioners, to persons who have shown themselves to be tax compliant. To meet legal requirements, this certificate should have been presented to a Dáil committee by 31 January 2008 by all those elected to the Dáil. A caveat allowed that in the absence of this, a certificate stating that the Dáil member was in negotiation with the Revenue Commissioners would suffice. An inability to declare tax compliance by a prominent individual, such as Ahern, would prove highly embarrassing, and could potentially have had more serious repercussions. The Standards in Public Office Act (2001) determines the tax clearance requirements for persons elected to the Oireachtas, and others. The making of a false declaration will be an offence. They will also have to produce a tax <b>clearance</b> <b>certificate.</b> There will, therefore, be considerable policing of tax compliance of members.|$|E

The protraction of these complaints, mostly to the disadvantage of the affected parties, necessitates the need for banks to urgently review their processes for handling affairs in relation to their separated employees. Consequently, Banks and Other Financial Institutions are by this Circular directed to review their processes for handling exited staff matters and to ensure that clearances and/or references (favourable or adverse) are issued to separated employees not later than 60 days from the date of the receipt of request for reference. Financial Institutions are to note that failure to comply with the above directive will attract appropriate sanctions...|$|R

5000|$|The provincial {{government}} will collaborate {{with the federal}} government to mitigate [...] "aggressive tax avoidance" [...] transactions used to attempt to avoid Ontario taxes, and to minimize tax losses as a result of corporations transferring profits to other jurisdictions. It proposed amendments to the Securities Act and Commodity Futures Act, adding new classes of securities fraud for attempted market manipulation and attempted fraud, clarifying insider trading regulations, and allowing the Ontario Securities Commission to share information with regulatory and law enforcement agencies. It also repealed the sunset provision to the Retail Sales Tax Act to enable the government to collect or secure tax debts. Specifically, the government would withhold <b>clearance</b> <b>certificates</b> until resolution of debts associated with the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation and Public Protection Act (1996), Fuel Tax Act, Gasoline Tax Act, Race Tracks Tax Act, and Tobacco Tax Act.

5000|$|The {{rarity of}} major {{disasters}} tends to breed complacency {{and even a}} contempt for written instructions. We believe that rules relevant to safety must be everyday working rules and {{be seen as an}} essential part of day-to-day work practice. Rules, designed to protect those who drew them up if something goes wrong, are readily ignored in day-to-day work. Where management lays down safety rules, it must also ensure that they are carried out. We believe that to this end considerable formality is essential in relation to such matters as permits to work and <b>clearance</b> <b>certificates</b> to enter vessels or plant areas. In order to keep strong control in the plant, the level of authority for authorisations must be clearly defined. Similarly the level of authority for technical approval for any plant modification must also be clearly defined. To avoid the danger of systems and procedures being disregarded, there should be a requirement for a periodic form of audit of them.|$|R
40|$|The Loyal Orange Association of British America is a Protestant fraternal society. The Loyal Orange Association {{originated}} in Ulster, Ireland {{during the late}} eighteenth century. Its purpose was to promote Protestant rights and privileges. The association was exclusively Protestant, fraternal, democratic, and benevolent. Orange principles were brought to Upper Canada by Protestant Irish settlers after 1815. The first Canadian Orange Lodge was formally established in Brockville, Leeds County, 1830. By the late 19 th and early 20 th century, the Loyal Orange Association of British North America had gained considerable popularity and political influence. Many prominent politicians, including several prime ministers, were members. Orangemen were particularly concerned with issues such as separate school funding, language rights, immigration, religious freedom and conscription. Further, they demanded the execution of Louis Riel and opposed the Jesuits Estates settlement. Administrative sketch courtesy Archives of Ontario. The collection consists of records accumulated by various lodges of the Loyal Orange Association of British America in the Niagara Region.
