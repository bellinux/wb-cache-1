40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} the effect of milk replacer incorporation on the physicochemical properties of <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate.</b> The formulations were developed using Mixture Design of Design Expert ® version 6. 0. through a binary mixing of skimmed milk powder and milk replacer at following ratios: 100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75 and 0 : 100. Results demonstrated that <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate</b> which comprised of 100 % milk replacer significantly had the darker colour and more viscous {{compared to the other}} <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate</b> samples (P≤ 0. 05). On the other hand, the <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate</b> which consisted of 75 % skimmed milk powder and 25 % milk replacer had better resistance to fat bloom formation throughout the 10 weeks of storage at room temperature (25 °C). This study suggested the feasibility of incorporating milk replacer in <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate.</b> The <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate</b> with <b>milk</b> replacer had softer texture and less fat bloom formation compared to the <b>milk</b> <b>chocolate</b> with skimmed <b>milk</b> powder alone...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aims of {{the present}} study were to {{evaluate}} the fluoride (F) concentrations in whole, defatted and <b>chocolate</b> <b>milks</b> commercially available in Brazil and to estimate the daily F intake from these sources. MATERIAL AND METHODS: F concentrations were determined for 23 brands of milks, after HMDS-facilitated diffusion, using a F ion-specific electrode. Possible F ingestion per kg body weight was estimated, based on suggested volumes of formula consumption, for infants aging 1 to 12 months. RESULTS: F concentrations ranged from 0. 02 to 1. 6 µg/mL F for all brands analyzed. Whole and defatted milks had the lowest F concentrations, ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 07 µg/mL. With respect to <b>chocolate</b> <b>milks,</b> three brands had F concentrations above 0. 5 µg/mL. Some brands of <b>chocolate</b> <b>milks</b> exceeded the dose regarded as the threshold level for the development of dental fluorosis, without taking into account other sources of fluoride intake. CONCLUSION: The high fluoride concentrations found in some brands of <b>chocolate</b> <b>milks</b> in the present study indicate that many products may be important contributors to the total fluoride intake, reinforcing the need of assaying fluoride content of foods and beverages consumed by small children...|$|R

500|$|Seven {{months into}} her captivity, Garrido {{introduced}} Dugard to his wife, Nancy, {{who brought the}} child a stuffed animal and <b>chocolate</b> <b>milk,</b> and engaged in the same tearful apologies to her. Though Dugard craved the woman's approval at the time, in retrospect she has stated that she was manipulated by Nancy, who alternated between motherly concern and coldness and cruelty, expressing her jealousy of Dugard, whom she regarded as the one to blame for her predicament. Dugard characterized Nancy, {{who worked as a}} nursing home aide, as [...] "evil" [...] and [...] "twisted." [...] When Garrido was returned to prison for failing a drug test, Nancy replaced her husband as Dugard's jailer. The Garridos manipulated Dugard further by presenting her, on two occasions, with kittens that would later [...] "mysteriously vanish." [...] When they discovered that she was signing her real name in a journal that she kept on the kittens, she was forced to tear out the page with her name on it, the last time she would be permitted to say or write her name until years later. She was never allowed to see a doctor or dentist.|$|E

On arrival, Celestia takes them to a grand hall with stained-glass windows, including one heralding the ponies' defeat of Nightmare Moon, and to the vault where the Elements of Harmony are kept. Celestia tells the ponies that the strange phenomena they have noticed is being caused by an old enemy of hers named , the spirit of chaos and disharmony. Celestia tells of how Discord once ruled Equestria in an eternal state of chaos before she and Luna defeated him by turning him into a stone statue (the Draconequus statue that stood in the sculpture garden). But he has recently escaped his prison and Celestia asks Twilight and her best friends to use the Elements of Harmony (as they previously did to defeat Nightmare Moon) to defeat Discord. However, as she offers the Elements to them, they are shocked to find that the box that normally holds the Elements is completely empty.|$|E
