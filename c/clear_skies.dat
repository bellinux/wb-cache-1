5|$|In 2002, Bush {{announced}} the <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> Act of 2003, aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution {{through the use}} of emissions trading programs. Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal. The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and <b>clear</b> <b>skies</b> greeted {{the players on}} the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and handed it to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E
5|$|Surface weather {{analyses}} {{have special}} symbols that show frontal systems, cloud cover, precipitation, or other important information. For example, an H may represent high pressure, implying <b>clear</b> <b>skies</b> and relatively warm weather. An L, {{on the other}} hand, may represent low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map. Areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location.|$|E

The naval force under Commander Cook departed from Britain during the afternoon, and the Whitley transport aircraft carrying C Company took off from RAF Thruxton in the evening.|$|E
5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, they form under <b>clear</b> <b>skies</b> and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of {{south-west}} England, the Blackdown Hills have a temperate climate that is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The mean temperature is approximately 10°C (50°F) and shows a seasonal and a diurnal variation, but because of the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom (UK). January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1°C (34°F) and 2°C (36°F). July and August are the warmest months, with mean daily maxima around 21°C (70°F). December is normally the most cloudy month and June the sunniest. High pressure over the Azores often brings <b>clear</b> <b>skies</b> to south-west England, particularly in summer.|$|E

5|$|Solar power {{tends to}} be {{complementary}} to wind. On daily to weekly timescales, high pressure areas tend to bring <b>clear</b> <b>skies</b> and low surface winds, whereas low pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier. On seasonal timescales, solar energy peaks in summer, whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter. Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat. In 2007 the Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power around the clock and throughout the year, entirely from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear is a {{microscale}} {{meteorological phenomenon}} occurring over {{a very small}} distance, {{but it can be}} associated with mesoscale or synoptic scale weather features such as squall lines and cold fronts. It is commonly observed near microbursts and downbursts caused by thunderstorms, fronts, areas of locally higher low-level winds referred to as low level jets, near mountains, radiation inversions that occur due to <b>clear</b> <b>skies</b> and calm winds, buildings, wind turbines, and sailboats. Wind shear has significant effects on control of an aircraft effect, and it has been a sole or contributing cause of many aircraft accidents.|$|E

5|$|The Hiroshima {{mission was}} {{followed}} by another atomic strike. Originally scheduled for 11 August, it was brought forward by two days to 9 August owing to a forecast of bad weather. This time, a Fat Man nuclear weapon was carried by B-29 Bockscar, piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney. Enola Gay, flown by Captain George Marquardt's Crew B-10, was the weather reconnaissance aircraft for Kokura, the primary target. Enola Gay reported <b>clear</b> <b>skies</b> over Kokura, {{but by the time}} Bockscar arrived, the city was obscured by smoke from fires from the conventional bombing of Yahata by 224 B-29s the day before. After three unsuccessful passes, Bockscar diverted to its secondary target, Nagasaki, where it dropped its bomb. In contrast to the Hiroshima mission, the Nagasaki mission has been described as tactically botched, although the mission did meet its objectives. The crew encountered a number of problems in execution, and had very little fuel by the time they landed at the emergency backup landing site Yontan Airfield on Okinawa.|$|E
5|$|As Wing Commander Kellett {{was taking}} off, Schumacher was dismissing {{any idea that}} the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather. On the island of Wangerooge, Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3, battery LN-Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer. Diehl was using Falck's 2./ZG 76 to test the set. After some demonstration, he swung the set north, {{pointing}} to the Heliogoland Bight. As soon {{as he did so}} he picked up an echo. He telephoned Schumacher's Geschwader at Jever. They were told that the naval radar reported nothing, and that it was ridiculous to think the British would attack in such <b>clear</b> <b>skies.</b> Diehl spoke to von Bülow-Bothkamp. No one wanted to know. Some 20 minutes later, naval Freyas also picked up the formation, but still no fighters were scrambled. German radar was just as efficient as its British counterpart, the problem lay in communication. The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system. The Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped, creating confusion over who was responsible. Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself on a day when conditions favoured the fighter. Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled. The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft, twice its actual strength.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the effect}} of clouds on the earth's {{radiation}} balance is often estimated as the difference of net radiative fluxes {{at the top of}} the atmosphere between all situations and monthly averaged <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> situations of the same regions, a reliable identification of <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> is important for the study of cloud radiative effects. The Scanner for Radiation Balance (ScaRaB) radiometer on board the Russian Meteor- 3 / 7 satellite provided earth radiation budget observations from March 1994 to February 1995 with two ERBE-Re broad-band longwave and shortwave channels. Two narrow-band channels, in the infrared atmospheric window and in the visible band, have been added to the ScaRaB instrument to improve the cloud scene identification. The International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) method for cloud detection and determination of cloud and surface properties uses the same narrow-band channels as ScaRaB, but is employed to a collection of measurements at a better spatial resolution of about 5 km. By applying the original ISCCP algorithms to the ScaRaB data, the <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> frequency is about 5 % lower than the one over quasi-simultaneous original ISCCP data, an indication that the ISCCP cloud detection is quite stable. However, one would expect an about 10 to 20 % smaller <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> occurrence over the larger ScaRaB pixels. Adapting the ISCCP algorithms to the reduced spatial resolution of 60 km and to the different time sampling of the ScaRaB data leads therefore to a reduction of a residual cloud contamination. A sensitivity study with time-space collocated ScaRaB and original ISCCP data at a spatial resolution of 1 deg longitude x 1 deg latitude shows that {{the effect of}} <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> identification method plays a higher role on the <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> frequency and therefore on the statistics than on the zonal mean values of the <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> fluxes. Nevertheless, the zonal outgoing longwave fluxes corresponding to ERBE <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> are in general about 2 to 10 W/sq m higher than those obtained from the ScaRaB adapted ISCCP <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> identifications. The latter are close to (about 1 W/sq m higher) fluxes corresponding to <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> regions from original ISCCP data, whereas ScaRaB <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> LW fluxes obtained with the original ISCCP identification lie about 1 to 2 W/sq m below. Especially in the tropics where water vapor abundance is high, the ERBE <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> LW fluxes seem to be systematically overestimated by about 4 W/sq m, and SW fluxes are lower by about 5 to 10 W/sq m. However, the uncertainty in the analysis of monthly mean zonal cloud radiative effects is also produced by the low frequency of <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> occurrence, illustrated when averaging over pixels or even over regions of 4 deg longitude x 5 deg latitude, corresponding to the spatial resolution of General Circulation Models. The systematic bias in the <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> fluxes is not reflected in the zonal cloud radiative effects, because the <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> regions selected by the different algorithms can occur in different geographic regions with different cloud properties...|$|R

5000|$|The Sun Trail {{begins with}} a group of cats known as the Tribe of Rushing Water, led by Stoneteller (formerly Half Moon), {{starving}} due to lack of food in their mountain home. Stoneteller receives a vision in which she is told that there is more prey if one follows the Sun. Later, when a young kit named Fluttering Bird dies of hunger, members of the Tribe vote to leave in search of food. A group of Tribe cats, led by <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky,</b> one of Fluttering Bird's elder brothers, decides to follow the [...] "sun trail" [...] as described to Stoneteller in her vision. When Jagged Peak, <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky's</b> youngest brother, who is still a kit, sneaks out of the Tribe's cave to catch up to <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky</b> and his group, their mother Quiet Rain becomes worried and asks Gray Wing, <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky's</b> other younger brother, to go follow as well, to which Gray Wing reluctantly agrees. Gray Wing finds Jagged Peak and saves him from an eagle, after which they catch up to <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky's</b> group. One of the journeying cats, Bright Stream, is <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky's</b> mate, and she reveals that she is carrying <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky's</b> kits. When the group stops to rest one night, a trio of eagles attempts to hunt the cats, forcing them to hide. However, while saving Gray Wing from an eagle, Bright Stream is carried away by an eagle; though she successfully kills, she falls to her death as a result. In the aftermath, a rift forms between <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky</b> and Gray Wing because Gray Wing believes that <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky</b> blames him for Bright Stream's death. However, later in the book, <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky</b> reveals that he blamed himself for Bright Stream's death, to which Gray Wing replies that perhaps it was no one's fault, and that the death was just a terrible accident. The journeying cats leave the mountains shortly after Bright Stream's death.
