40|$|Abstract Background Virus-mediated {{delivery}} of therapeutic transgenes to the inflamed colon holds a great potential {{to serve as}} an effective therapeutic strategy for inflammatory bowel disease, since local, long-term expression of the encoded therapeutic proteins in the colorectal system is potentially achievable. Viral vectors, derived from adeno-associated virus (AAV), should be very useful for such therapeutic strategies, particularly because they can establish long-term expression of transgenes. However, few studies have been carried out to investigate the ability of AAV-based vectors to transduce the inflamed colon. Results AAV, derived from adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV 2), showed a limited ability to transduce <b>colonic</b> <b>cell</b> lines in vitro when used in free form. No appreciable enhancement of the transduction efficiency was seen when AAV 2 particles were attached stably to the surfaces of microbeads and delivered to target cells in the form of AAV 2 -microbead conjugates. However, the transduction efficiency of these <b>colonic</b> <b>cell</b> lines was enhanced substantially when a lectin, concanavalin A (Con A), was co-attached to the microbead surfaces, to which AAV 2 particles had been conjugated. This considerable infectivity enhancement of AAV 2 -microbead conjugates by the co-attachment of Con A may be derived from the fact that Con A binds to α-D-mannosyl moieties that are commonly and abundantly present in cell-surface carbohydrate chains, allowing the conjugates to associate stably with target cells. Intracolonical administration of free AAV 2 or AAV 2 -microbead conjugates without Con A into a mouse colitis model by enema showed very poor transduction of the colonic tissue. In contrast, the {{delivery of}} AAV 2 in the form of AAV 2 -microbead conjugates bearing Con A resulted in efficient transduction of the inflamed colon. Conclusion AAV 2 -microbead conjugates bearing Con A can serve as efficient gene transfer agents both for poorly permissive <b>colonic</b> <b>cell</b> lines in vitro and for the inflamed colon in a mouse colitis model. This efficient transduction system for the inflamed colon should be useful for the development of gene therapy strategies for inflammatory bowel disease. </p...|$|E

To {{investigate}} whether SS {{has a direct}} effect on <b>colonic</b> smooth muscle <b>cells,</b> we prepared isolated muscle cells from the descending guinea pig colon and compared the effects of SS with those on isolated gastric smooth muscle cells. In gastric cells, SS {{had no effect on}} carbachol-induced contraction, whereas in <b>colonic</b> <b>cells</b> it caused inhibition. In <b>colonic</b> muscle <b>cells,</b> SS- 28 caused > 85 % inhibition of contraction by cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK- 8), bombesin, 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate, and ionomycin, whereas it had no effect on contraction by these agents in gastric cells. In gastric cells, SS inhibited relaxation. Three synthetic SS analogs had different relative affinities for causing effects in gastric and <b>colonic</b> <b>cells.</b> Pertussis toxin inhibited the action of SS- 28 in each muscle cell type by 50 - 75 %. SS- 28 alone had a small contractile effect on cells from the circular layer of the colon. SS- 28 inhibited carbachol-induced contraction in <b>colonic</b> <b>cells</b> from both the longitudinal and circular layers. These results demonstrate that the action of SS differs in colonic and gastric smooth muscle cells. SS inhibits contractants in <b>colonic</b> <b>cells</b> and relaxants in gastric <b>cells.</b> In <b>colonic</b> <b>cells,</b> SS has a weak contractile effect due to an effect on circular muscle cells and an inhibitory effect on cells from both longitudinal and circular layers. A different SS receptor subtype mediates the actions of SS in colonic and gastric muscle cells. In both cell types, the actions of SS are mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) acts via several targets, {{including}} cannabinoid CB 1 and CB 2 receptors, transient receptor potential vanilloid type- 1 (TRPV 1) ion channels, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR α) and orphan G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GRR 55), {{all involved}} in the control of intestinal inflammation. Here, we investigated the effect of PEA in a murine model of colitis. Experimental Approach Colitis was induced in mice by intracolonic administration of dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (DNBS). Inflammation was assessed by evaluating inflammatory markers/parameters and by histology; intestinal permeability by a fluorescent method; <b>colonic</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation by immunohistochemistry; PEA and endocannabinoid levels by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; receptor and enzyme mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR. Key Results DNBS administration caused inflammatory damage, increased colonic levels of PEA and endocannabinoids, down-regulation of mRNA for TRPV 1 and GPR 55 but no changes in mRNA for CB 1, CB 2 and PPARα. Exogenous PEA (i. p. and/or p. o., 1 mg·kg- 1) attenuated inflammation and intestinal permeability, stimulated <b>colonic</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, and increased colonic TRPV 1 and CB 1 receptor expression. The anti-inflammatory effect of PEA was attenuated or abolished by CB 2 receptor, GPR 55 or PPARα antagonists and further increased by the TRPV 1 antagonist capsazepine. Conclusions and Implications PEA improves murine experimental colitis, the effect being mediated by CB 2 receptors, GPR 55 and PPARα, and modulated by TRPV 1 channels...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D-insufficiency is a {{prevalent}} {{condition in}} populations throughout the world, with low serum levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD) {{linked to a}} variety of human health concerns including cancer, autoimmune disease and infection. Current data suggest that 25 OHD action involves localized extra-renal conversion to 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D (1, 25 (OH) 2 D) via tissue-specific expression of the enzyme 25 -hydroxyvitamin D- 1 α-hydroxylase (1 α-hydroxylase). In cells such as macrophages, expression of 1 α-hydroxylase is intimately associated with toll-like receptor (TLR) recognition of pathogens. However, this mechanism may not be exclusive to extra-renal generation of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D. To investigate the relationship between TLR-mediated pathogen recognition and vitamin D-induced antibacterial activity, intracrine responses to 25 OHD metabolism were explored in vitro using the established <b>colonic</b> <b>cell</b> lines Caco- 2 and Caco- 2 clone BBe. Analysis of antibacterial factors such as cathelicidin (LL 37) and β-defensin- 4 (DEFB 4) was carried out following co-treatment with TLR ligands. Data indicate that, unlike macrophages, Caco- 2 and BBe <b>colonic</b> <b>cell</b> lines are unresponsive to TLR-induced 1 α-hydroxylase. Alternative activators of 1 α-hydroxylase such as transforming growth factor β were also ineffective at priming intracrine responses to 25 OHD. Thus, in common with other barrier sites such as the skin or placenta, colonic epithelial cells may require specific factors to initiate intracrine responses to vitamin D...|$|E

In addition, the contribution of <b>colonic</b> epithelial <b>cell</b> associated uPA activity to disease related pertubations of mucosal uPA activity were examined. A highly enriched population of <b>colonic</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> was isolated from resected colon or biopsy specimens by an enzymatic technique. uPA activity was measured in cell homogenates by a specific and sensitive colorimetric method and expressed relative to cellular DNA. In two experiments subcellular fractionation of <b>colonic</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> was performed by nitrogen cavitation followed by ultracentrifugation over a linear sucrose gradient. The fractions collected were analysed for uPA and organelle-specific enzyme activities. Normal <b>colonic</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> have cell associated uPA activity (mean (SEM) 5. 6 (1. 1) IU/mg, n = 18). This colocalised with fractions enriched for leucine-beta-naphthylamidase and 5 '-nucleotidase, markers of plasma membrane. uPA activities in epithelial cells from cancerous colons (9. 8 (3. 1) n = 7) or from mucosa affected by inflammatory bowel disease (3. 8 (0. 7) n = 15) were not significantly different from normal (paired t test), while that in epithelial cells from greatly inflamed mucosa was similar to that from autologous normal or mildly inflamed areas (4. 4 (1. 2) v 5. 9 (3. 6), n = 9). Thus normal <b>colonic</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> have cell associated uPA activity which is concentrated on the plasma membranes, suggesting the presence of uPA receptors.

40|$|The hormone gastrin exerts a growth-promoting {{effect on}} {{gastrointestinal}} cells. The molecular {{mechanisms by which}} <b>colonic</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> respond to gastrin are still poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate a novel feature of the action of gastrin on normal <b>colonic</b> <b>cells,</b> namely the rapid phosphorylation on tyrosine of phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1, elicited by gastrin, was transient, concentration-dependent, and was abrogated by pretreating the <b>colonic</b> <b>cells</b> with the gastrin-receptor antagonist proglumide, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, and by removal of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate from the isolation buffer. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1 correlated with the time- and concentration-dependent decrease in the mass of membrane phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) {{and the increase in}} the epithelial concentration of inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3). Likewise, the stimulated increase in IP 3 was also prevented by proglumide and genistein. Gastrin induced a definite but transient increase in the intracellular concentration of free Ca 2 + [Ca 2 +]i, and increased membrane-translocation of immunoreactive alpha- and beta-protein kinase C. The data thus indicate that gastrin elicits at least one signalling cascade, through rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1, leading to the activation of a PIP 2 -specific PLC pathway...|$|R

As genes involved in RA synthesis from ROL were differentially expressed {{along the length of the}} colon, we tested the effect of ROL on proximal and distal colon organoids separately.

Interestingly, neither retinaldehyde (RAL), an intermediate product of the ROL-RA pathway, nor RA exhibited growth promoting effects on the proximal colon organoids, suggesting that ROL-dependent growth enhancement in organoids involves an RA-independent mechanism. This was confirmed by the observation that an inhibitor for RA-mediated gene transcription did not abrogate the effect of ROL on organoids.

40|$|The {{epithelial}} {{sodium channel}} (ENaC) mediates electrogenic sodium absorption in the distal large intestine. In patients with {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD), ENaC induction is impaired, mainly via transcriptional suppression by pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α. This can be overcome by glucocorticoid therapy which promotes an anti-inflammatory effect {{as well as a}} rapid increase in sodium absorption. While ENaC induction by mineralocorticoids {{has been shown to be}} antagonized by TNF-α, the interplay between glucocorticoids and TNF-α in ENaC regulation has remained elusive. Therefore, in the first part of this project, the influence of TNF-α on ENaC induction by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone has been characterized in rat distal colon and in the human <b>colonic</b> <b>cell</b> line HT- 29 /B 6 -GR. In both systems, dexamethasone not only preserved TNF-α-mediated ENaC suppression but caused synergistic induction of ENaC-dependent sodium absorption. This synergism was the result of a TNF-α-mediated stabilization of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) -mRNA leading to enhanced GR protein levels and a subsequent GR transactivation by dexamethasone. In parallel, transcription of the ENaC β and γ-subunits was up-regulated which increased ENaC-dependent sodium absorption. Furthermore, it was revealed that the activitiy of mitogen-activated protein kinase p 38 was required for the observed synergy. The synergistic increase in ENaC-mediated sodium transport via an enhanced expression of ENaC subunits β and γ dependent on TNF-α and dexamethasone explains the rapid and intense proabsorptive effect of glucocorticoid therapy in IBD. Besides glucocorticoids the short-chain fatty acid butyrate is applied in the therapy of IBD. It was shown that butyrate also induces transcriptional up-regulation of ENaC. Still, for the generation of significant transport rates via ENaC the additional presence of corticosteroids was essential. The underlying mechanisms of this observation remained unknown due to the lack of a <b>colonic</b> <b>cell</b> line expressing functional mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). In the second part of this project, an epithelial <b>colonic</b> <b>cell</b> model inducibly expressing the MR (HT- 29 /B 6 -Tet-On-MR) was generated. In this cell model, nanomolar doses of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone induced functional ENaC. The simultaneous presence of butyrate was a prerequisite for this induction, leading to high-level expression of the MR. This allowed for aldosterone-dependent up-regulation of β and γ-ENaC expression. As butyrate alone was not capable of promoting ENaC-mediated sodium transport, aldosterone-induced GILZ (Glucocorticoid-induced Leucin Zipper) was identified as a candidate factor increasing ENaC levels...|$|E

It was concluded that methionine up to 1 % in the diet had no effect on cell proliferation, using the 3 H-thymidine assay. The same study revealed that fecal alkaline phosphatase excretion is a good marker for colonic epithelial damage and fecal magnesium excretion is not. In Study 2, the hypothesis was tested that soy fractions enriched with isoflavones and saponins may increase fat excretion and so influence <b>colonic</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation in rats. It was indeed shown that soy protein isolate and an ethanolic extract from soy protein isolate slightly increased fecal fat excretion (up to 1. 7 -fold). However, fecal water bile acid and free fatty acid concentrations were decreased after feeding soy protein-based diets compared with casein, and no difference in fecal alkaline phosphatase excretion was observed. In Study 3, the lytic potential of soy saponins and the interaction between saponins and some lytic bile acids were tested in vitro. Data suggest a protective effect from soy saponins by reducing lytic activity of cholic acid.

Western blotting and surface plasmon resonance showed that VEGF 165 b bound to bevacizumab with similar affinity as VEGF 165. However, although bevacizumab effectively inhibited the rapid growth of colon carcinomas expressing VEGF 165, it did not affect the slower growth of tumours from <b>colonic</b> carcinoma <b>cells</b> expressing VEGF 165 b.

Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) activation enhances apoptosis, and a link between GH and PPARgamma in the colonic epithelium of acromegalic patients has been suggested. We investigated the effects of GH and of PPARgamma ligands on apoptosis in <b>colonic</b> cancer <b>cell</b> lines. <b>Colonic</b> <b>cells</b> showed specific binding sites for GH, and after exposure to 0. 05 - 50 nm GH, their apoptosis reduced by 45 %. The antiapoptotic effect was due to either GH directly or GH-dependent local production of IGF- 1. A 55 - 85 % reduction of PPARgamma expression was observed in GH-treated cells, compared with controls (P < 0. 05). However, treatment of the cells with 1 - 50 microm ciglitazone (cig), induced apoptosis and reverted the antiapoptotic effects of GH by increasing the programmed cell death up to 3. 5 -fold at 30 min and up to 1. 7 -fold at 24 h. Expression of Bcl- 2 and TNF-related apoptosis-induced ligand was not affected by either GH or cig treatment, whereas GH reduced the expression of Bax, which was increased by cig treatment. In addition, GH increased the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 b, which might {{be involved in the}} down-regulation of PPARgamma expression. In conclusion, GH may exert a direct antiapoptotic effect on <b>colonic</b> <b>cells,</b> through an increased expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 b and a reduction of Bax and PPARgamma. The reduced GH-dependent apoptosis can be overcome by PPARgamma ligands, which might be useful chemopreventive agents in acromegalic patients, who have an increased colonic polyps prevalence...|$|R
40|$|A {{sensitive}} 4 h 51 Cr-release cytotoxicity assay {{has been}} developed using as targets <b>colonic</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> obtained by Dispase-collagenase digestion of resected mucosa or colonoscopic biopsies. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) from most healthy donors showed low, but significant levels of cytotoxicity for normal epithelial cell target cells of 8. 7 (4. 4) % (mean (SD] and similar levels were found in 14 ulcerative colitis (6. 5 (4. 4) %) and 16 Crohn's disease (6. 2 (5. 2) %) patients. Neither drug therapy nor disease activity influenced the results. The sensitivity of <b>colonic</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> isolated from inflamed and histologically normal mucosa to lysis by peripheral blood MNC from a single donor was not affected by the underlying disease. Anti-epithelial cell activity did not correlate with anti-K 562 activity and the cytotoxic cell was plastic non-adherent and Leu- 11 b-. None of 15 MNC populations isolated from mucosa of normal, tumour bearing, or chronically inflamed intestine exhibited significant lysis of <b>colonic</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> despite killing of K 562 target cells in 10. Lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells, generated by interleukin- 2 stimulation in vitro of nine intestinal and seven peripheral blood MNC populations, exhibited high levels of lysis of K 562 cells but, on every occasion, failed to lyse <b>colonic</b> epithelial <b>cells.</b> These data indicate that spontaneously cytotoxic or LAK cells are unlikely {{to play a role}} in the generation of <b>colonic</b> epithelial <b>cell</b> injury by direct cytotoxicity in inflammatory bowel disease...|$|R
40|$|The postembryonic {{development}} of the gastrointestinal tract is subject to regulation by the colonizing microbiota. This maturation process requires the commensal bacteria to cross-talk with host cells by way of recognizing receptors and inducing signaling pathways to activate transcription {{factors such as the}} nuclear receptors. Here, we show that in <b>colonic</b> <b>cell</b> lines and in primary colonic cells, Enterococcus faecalis isolated from newborn babies possess the ability to regulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ 1 (PPARγ 1) activity through phosphorylation. This results in elevated DNA binding and transcriptional activation of downstream target genes, including IL- 10, a cytokine known to modulate innate immune function. Furthermore, phosphorylation appears tightly regulated as phospho-PPARγ 1 becomes an immediate substrate for degradation possibly to curtail any extended transactivation. The involvement of PPARγ 1 in a myriad of physiological processes further confirms that microflora-driven regulation might be important for a number of homeostatic strategies in the gut...|$|E
30|$|The {{efficacy}} of free-Ral and SMA-Ral {{for the protection}} against intestinal mucosal inflammation was tested in vivo. DSS model of induced colitis was used because of its rapid effect, simplicity, reproducibility and controllability [27]. DSS is negatively charged due to its sulfate groups, the drug can interact with medium-chain-length fatty acids in the colon and could erode negatively charged colonic mucosal cells resulting in enhancing the <b>colonic</b> <b>cell</b> permeability to colonic bacteria, hence the DSS shows its peak inflammatory effect on the colon, which bears the highest bacterial content in the GI tract [28]. In administering the DSS at 3 % in Balb/C mice, {{there was not much}} weight loss in control groups, however, both free and SMA-Ral treated mice showed significant weight gain (Fig.  4 a). Weight gain is known to develop early after DSS treatment; however this usually is reversed as inflammation progressed. SMA-Ral and free-Ral could possibly simulate this early stage of inflammation resulting in persistent weight gain at 14  days [27].|$|E
40|$|License, which permits {{unrestricted}} use, distribution, {{and reproduction}} in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{has become one}} of the most common fatal cancers. CRC tumorigenesis is a complex process involving multiple genetic changes to several sequential mutations or molecular alterations. P 53 is one of the most significant genes; its mutations account for more than half of all CRC. Therefore, understanding the cellular genes that are directly or indirectly related to p 53 is particularly crucial for investigating CRC tumorigenesis. In this study, a p 53 -related ribosomal protein, ribosomal protein S 19 (RPS 19), obtained from the feces of CRC patients is evaluated by using specifically quantitative real-time PCR and knocked down in the <b>colonic</b> <b>cell</b> line by gene silencing. This study found that CRC patients with higher expressions of RPS 19 in their feces had a better prognosis and consistent expressions of RPS 19 and BAX in their colonic cells. In conclusion, the potential mechanis...|$|E

To further understand the role of HPV 16 DNA in colorectal carcinogenesis, NIH 3 T 3 cells were transformed with high molecular weight DNA from <b>colonic</b> cancer <b>cells</b> and the expression of HPV 16 DNA detected. Both human Alu and HPV 16 DNA sequences were found in the type II foci of CC-M 2 T cells by Southern blot hybridisation. Additionally, 100 % tumorigenicity in nude mice was seen. This study shows the transfection of HPV DNA from colonic cancers into NIH 3 T 3 mouse cells and suggests that HPV type 16 might be associated with the malignant transformation of <b>colonic</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

Differential <b>cell</b> surface abundance of ephrin type-B receptor 2 (EPHB 2) allows the purification of different cell types from human colon mucosa biopsies.
