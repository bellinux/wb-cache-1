With some guidance from David, Rebecca began exploring her own interest in photography as well. After {{a series of events}} caused Rebecca to begin doubting what she knew about her paternity, she took a DNA test which revealed that David Caplan was her father, rather than William Walker. She confronted David, who told her that he did not previously know she was his daughter and would not have been a stable or reliable father if he had known. She did not immediately tell the Walkers that she was not related to them, but kept the test results to herself until after Justin revealed that he had some romantic feelings for her. She then confronted Holly, who called Rebecca ungrateful for all the sacrifices Holly had made for her and threw her out of the house. The Walkers learned that the [...] "R" [...] in the <b>computer</b> <b>password</b> had never stood for Rebecca at all, but for Ryan, a child William had with yet another mistress.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{ability to}} {{identify}} and authenticate users {{is regarded as the}} foundation of computer security. Although new authentication technologies are evolving, passwords are the most common method used to control access in most computer systems. Research suggests that a large portion of computer security password breaches are the result of poor user security behaviour. The password creation and management practices that online consumers apply have a direct effect on the level of computer security and are often targeted in attacks. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate South African online consumers’ <b>computer</b> <b>password</b> security practices and to determine whether consumers’ perceptions regarding their password security ability is reflected in the password creation and management practices that they apply. Method: A Web-based survey was designed to (1) determine online consumers’ perceptions of their skills and competence in respect of <b>computer</b> <b>password</b> security and (2) determine the practices that South African online consumers apply when creating and managing passwords. The measures applied were then compared to (1) the users’ perceptions about their <b>computer</b> <b>password</b> security abilities and (2) the results of international studies to determine agreement and inconsistencies. Results: South African online consumers regard themselves as proficient password users. However, various instances of unsafe passwords practices were identified. The results of this South African study correspond with the results of various international studies confirming that challenges to ensure safe online transacting are in line with international challenges. Conclusion: There is a disparity between South African online consumers’ perceived ability regarding <b>computer</b> <b>password</b> security and the password creation and management practices that they apply. </p...|$|E
40|$|The number {{partitioning}} {{problem is}} to decide whether a given multiset of integers can be partitioned into two "halves " of given cardinalities such that the discrepancy, the absolute value of the difference of their sums is minimized. While Partitioning problem {{is known to be}} NP-complete, only few studies have investigated on its variations. Number partitioning problem has a wide range of practical application, like: multiprocessor scheduling, minimization of VLSI circuit size and delay, also used in public key cryptography, message verification, <b>computer</b> <b>password,</b> voting manipulation and bin packing. While lots of investigation have been made for two-way partitioning, only a few for multi-way partitioning, while most of them are not feasible for real time environment. We introduce an improved multi-way partitioning algorithm which is feasible for real time environment. It returns maximum number of subset that can be made based on the order of the numbers as they appear. Maximum number of subset helps us to preempt any process & serve higher priority process with extremely low overhead cost in multiprocessor process scheduling...|$|E
5000|$|In private verification, the {{reference}} data should not leak relevant information {{to allow the}} verifier to (effectively) construct valid measurement data. Such protection is common practice for storage of <b>computer</b> <b>passwords.</b> When a <b>computer</b> verifies a <b>password,</b> it does not compare the password typed by the user with a stored reference copy. Instead, the password is processed by a cryptographic one-way function F and the outcome is compared against a locally stored reference string F(y [...] ). So y is only temporarily available on the system hardware, and no stored data allows calculation of y. This prevents attacks from the inside by stealing unencrypted or decryptable secrets.|$|R

40|$|Heightened {{interest}} and increased accessibility to computer systems have presented new threats to computer security, {{particularly in the}} areas of unauthorized system access. To counter such threats, <b>computer</b> <b>password</b> systems are used due to ease of implementation and low cost. However, there is nothing to prohibit access to a system if an adversary has discovered a valid password. Passwords are therefore open to compromise without the knowledge of their disclosure. In addition, passwords are static identity verifiers implying the same person is assumed until log-off. ^ There is very limited evidence of studies done with respect to techniques which aid in dynamically discriminating among users to ascertain whether the user at the terminal is actually the verified and authorized user at login time. A new authentication model is developed which is based on the variability in individual human-computer interactions, and implements a technique for formally modeling and analytically evaluating human-computer interactions. It employs dynamic, continuous, unobtrusive verification throughout a user 2 ̆ 7 s login session. The model is used in conjunction with a system 2 ̆ 7 s existing password mechanism and is composed of individual user models, based on users 2 ̆ 7 personal cognitive characteristics and usage patterns. Each user model is developed using probabilistic finite automata theory combined with time measures. This work also addresses informational issues regarding data accumulation, calibration, and model dimensionality. ...|$|E
