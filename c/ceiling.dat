5|$|That {{part of the}} {{restoration}} in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is the <b>ceiling,</b> painted by Michelangelo. The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, {{the work on the}} <b>ceiling</b> proceeded and, according to critics such as James Beck, their worst fears were confirmed once the <b>ceiling</b> was completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} {{were influenced}} by Inigo Jones, but executed by his heir John Webb, a fact confirmed many years later when the National Trust discovered Webb's plans during their formal takeover of the estate. The interiors mostly date from about 1835. The hall has a barrel-vaulted high <b>ceiling</b> with painted decoration and the dining room has panelled walls, tapestries and a decorated plaster <b>ceiling.</b> The library has a <b>ceiling</b> painting attributed to Guido Reni. The staircase is of white marble with turned balusters and a relief frieze, its ornamented <b>ceiling</b> being attributed to Giorgione.|$|E
5|$|This <b>ceiling</b> conceals the mediaeval trusses of {{the fifteenth}} century <b>ceiling.</b> The wagon roof over the chancel was boarded or plastered, as slots in the {{principals}} show, in 1491 by William Stratford, DTh, Abbot of Vale Royal Abbey (in post 1476–1516, with gaps); the exact dating was derived from the timbers, which retain complete sapwood. The original <b>ceiling</b> can still be reached from the ringing chamber in the central tower, and includes an arch-braced collar-beam truss, with traces of five cross-ribs equally spaced on the soffit of the four-centred moulded arch. The truss had slots for the panels of a boarded <b>ceiling</b> (a wagon roof).|$|E

5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the <b>ceiling</b> level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the <b>ceiling</b> through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the <b>ceiling</b> permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{a number}} of rooms feature period wall and <b>ceiling</b> decorations {{including}} the entrance hall, which dates from the original 1730s building and features moulded panelling and cornices, a marble fireplace and ornamental plaster <b>ceiling</b> and an arabesque frieze. The stairwell is lit from above with a roof light and features a cantilevered stair with iron balusters from the 1825 adaptation with a later brass handrail.|$|E

40|$|Legislatures {{institute}} usury <b>ceilings</b> for {{a variety}} of reasons. The <b>ceilings</b> are designed to (1) curb excessive profits, (2) lower interest rates and inflation, (3) stimulate housing and growth, (4) subsidize certain consumer groups, and (5) protect the unwary and uninformed. However, in each case, the usury celings set up perverse effects which may defeat these goals. Particularly since the legislatures do not provide for administrative remedies, rationing, or adjustable <b>ceilings,</b> they cannot control these effects. Any reinstitution of <b>ceilings</b> must avoid these problems if the goals of the program are not to be defeated. However, the most effective policy would be to avoid the usury <b>ceilings</b> altogether. Copyright American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association. ...|$|R

5|$|On February 28, 2001, the Nisqually {{earthquake}} {{rocked the}} 5th Avenue Theatre. At the time, actors were on stage rehearsing the musical 1776. The theatre suffered minimal damages with no structural {{damage from the}} quake. Earthquake repairs included removal and replacement of 72 plaster <b>ceiling</b> supports and the repair of numerous cracks and damaged decorative plaster pieces in the <b>ceiling.</b> Contractors had to install scaffolding tall enough to reach the highest interior crevice in the <b>ceiling</b> eight stories up—the first time that area had been reached in 75 years. The chandeliers had to be lowered for repair and maintenance. As part of the repair work, Turner Construction provided services for seismic upgrades to the Skinner Building.|$|E

5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} <b>ceiling</b> {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} indirect lighting to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing palette of color to the <b>ceiling</b> above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural lighting design patents, one for his <b>ceiling</b> grid with indirect lighting and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented <b>ceiling</b> grid once more in the Patent Leather Bar, in 1939.|$|E

On {{the basis of the}} setting requirements of fire detector, the numerical simulation of smoke movement below and above grid <b>ceilings</b> with four kinds of hollowing rates was conducted in the standard combustion lab by using FDS software. After that, according to the GB 4715 - 2005 National Standard's sensitivity requirements of the 75 mm¥ 75 mm size grid <b>ceilings,</b> the experimental researches on the response characteristics of photoelectric smoke detectors, which were above or under the grid <b>ceilings,</b> were carried out under conditions of different obscuration rates and in FDS simulations. Finally, through comparative analysis of the experimental study and numerical simulation results, the correctness of numerical simulations and the feasibility of using FDS to study the smoke spread below and above grid <b>ceilings</b> were validated...|$|R
40|$|Imposing <b>ceilings</b> on the {{interest}} rate has recently {{become one of the}} new hottest topics in microfinance industry; various debates have been discussing this issue to know the effect of interest rate <b>ceilings</b> on the supply of credit in particular and on microfinance industry in general. However in spite of the good intention behind these <b>ceilings,</b> there was no absolute result stating that <b>ceilings</b> have really contributed to the improvement or protection of the poor clients, indeed, these <b>ceilings</b> have hurt those low income people instead of helping them, due to these <b>ceilings</b> most of MFIs left the market or reduced their scale due to the inability to continue operating with low interest rate leaving the very poor clients without access to credit. Thus, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to review the impact of imposing such <b>ceilings</b> on {{the interest}} rates and to find out what alterative solutions can be employed as substitutes for them. This paper is entirely based on the secondary data collected from various records related to microfinance such as microfinance books, official websites and reports, published papers, and other sources related to the research subject...|$|R

5|$|The {{iconography}} of the <b>ceiling</b> has had various interpretations in the past, {{some elements of}} which have been contradicted by modern scholarship. Others, such as the identity of the figures in the lunettes and spandrels, continue to defy interpretation. Modern scholars have sought, as yet unsuccessfully, to determine a written source of the theological program of the <b>ceiling</b> and have questioned {{whether or not it was}} entirely devised by the artist himself, who was both an avid reader of the Bible and a genius. Also of interest to some modern scholars is the question of how Michelangelo's own spiritual and psychological state is reflected in the iconography and the expression of the <b>ceiling.</b> One such speculation is that Michelangelo was tormented by conflict between homosexual desires and passionate Christian beliefs.|$|E
