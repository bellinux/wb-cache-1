50|$|The UIL {{agitation}} {{focused attention}} {{on the fact that}} many families lived on patches of land too small to provide a decent livelihood even without rent. Agitation by tenant farmers continued to press for <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> <b>purchase,</b> but the four years of almost ceaseless activity that O’Brien put into the League had not brought the benefits for the tenants he had hoped for, apart from giving the Parliamentary party a new lease of life. Nevertheless, the Chief Secretary for Ireland Wyndham came to recognise the dire situation of the starved population of the west of Ireland. The existence of the United Irish League, the conversion of the Ulster Protestant tenant leader T. W. Russell to <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> <b>purchase,</b> O'Brien whipping up enthusiasm for his winter program of boycotting and agitation together with the cost of maintaining a huge police force to quell agrarian unrest, influenced Wyndham to recognise that {{the time had come to}} construct a Land Bill for Ireland.|$|R

5000|$|Russell was the Liberal Unionist MP for South Tyrone. He {{and some}} {{followers}} left {{the party in}} February 1904. They favoured a policy of <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> <b>purchase.</b> [...] Dod's Parliamentary Companion regarded them as ex-Liberal Unionists who had joined the Liberal Party, although Russell's two Parliamentary colleagues had been first elected as Independent Unionists {{and they did not}} seek re-election as Liberals in 1906.|$|R
5000|$|As {{prelude to}} O'Brien's {{formation}} of the AFIL, Redmond called a National Convention at the Mansion House, Dublin, 9 February 1909, to win support for a House of Commons bill introducing <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> <b>purchase</b> while curtailing funding of tenant <b>land</b> <b>purchase</b> under the Birrell Land Act (1909). Over 3000 UIL delegates attended. Redmond, who chaired the meeting, claimed it would burden the British Treasury and local ratepayers excessively. O'Brien argued that the curtailing Bill would kill <b>land</b> <b>purchase</b> by provoking refusal by landlords to sell and worsen relations between tenants and landlords. The convention was obviously loaded against O'Brien when delegates suspected of supporting him were excluded at the entrance and assaulted in [...] "probably the stormiest meeting ever held by constitutional nationalists".|$|R
5000|$|A {{second period}} of {{agitation}} began with rent strikes in 1885 {{accompanied by the}} Plan of Campaign during 1886 to 1892. Land Acts in 1885 and 1891 provided for limited tenant <b>land</b> <b>purchase,</b> but as the acts were cumbersome and unwieldy they were little availed of by tenants. The third period of unrest was {{around the turn of}} the century, from 1898 to 1902, when, backed by intensified campaigns for <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> <b>purchase</b> of both William O’Brien MP’s United Irish League (UIL) and T. W. Russell MP’s Ulster farmer’s organisation in 1901-2, [...] tenants again agitated for concessions from their landlords. There was also a growing resentment at the landlord class as enunciated by Russell, who castigated their control of land as ‘systemised and legal robbery’.|$|R

25|$|UIL {{agitation}} by tenant farmers {{continued to}} press for <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> <b>purchase</b> and resulted in the calling of the December 1902 Land Conference, an initiative by moderate landlords led by Lord Dunraven {{on the one hand}} and William O'Brien, John Redmond MP, Timothy Harrington MP and Ulster's T. W. Russell MP representing tenant farmers on the other hand. It strove for a settlement by conciliatory agreement between landlord and tenant. After six sittings all eight tenant's demands were conceded, O'Brien having guided the official nationalist movement into endorsement of a new policy of conciliation. He followed this by campaigning vigorously for the greatest piece of social legislation Ireland had yet seen, orchestrating the Wyndham <b>Land</b> <b>Purchase</b> Act (1903) through Parliament. The Act provided very generous bonus subsidy terms to landowners on sale.|$|R
40|$|The author {{examines}} the materialization of geographical knowledges {{in relation to}} the ongoing neoliberalization of urban space where the latter is based on processes of <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> <b>purchase.</b> The specific context for the study is two recently planned commercial redevelopments for the south London borough of Croydon in the United Kingdom, and the arguments mustered in support of these proposals. The author identifies and discusses three principal sets of geographical knowledges, which he examines under the headings symbolic, biopolitical, and scalar. In each case, he shows that the knowledges have strong modernist overtones. The paper seeks both to understand and contextualize these historical connections, and to consider the contemporary political work performed by the knowledges in question. ...|$|R

5000|$|He unsuccessfully contested Preston in 1885 as a Liberal. However, {{he opposed}} William Ewart Gladstone's Home Rule policy and {{was elected to}} the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland as a Liberal Unionist in 1886 for South Tyrone. He served between 1895 and 1900 as Parliamentary Secretary to the Local Government Board in the Unionist {{administration}} of Lord Salisbury.However, Russell's views on Home Rule underwent a change around the turn the century and he gradually became a critic of Unionist policies in Ireland. From 1900 put himself {{at the head of the}} Farmers and Labourers Union, an Ulster tenant-farmer protest movement demanding <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> <b>purchase,</b> similar to the land and labour movement in the south. His 1901 book Ireland and the Empire was an attack on the Irish agrarian system. From 1902 to 1903 he was a key Ulster farmer representative [...] at the Dublin [...] "Land Conference" [...] which resulted in the passing of the <b>Land</b> <b>Purchase</b> Act of 1903. This defused the Protestant tenant-farmers' revolt.|$|R
50|$|Jenks {{took charge}} of the {{agricultural}} policy of the BUF, seeking to lead Britain to agricultural autarky. He called for import controls and the establishment of an Agricultural Land Bank in order to make farm debt more manageable as well as an Agricultural Corporation to fix prices and fit in with the BUF corporatist economic policy. Landowners who were seen to be misusing their land would also be subject to compulsory purchase, with a Volunteer Land Army established to restore the reclaimed territory. Whilst Jenks' ideas were never put into practice {{it has been argued that}} they did affect government policy, as moves towards agricultural self-sufficiency became the cornerstone of policy in the late 1940s whilst earlier initiatives such as the British Empire Economic Conference and Import Duties Act 1932 also borrowed from Jenks' protectionist vision. Similarly the Defence Regulations included DR49 which allowed for <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> <b>purchase,</b> whilst the Agriculture Act 1947 allowed for price-fixing as Jenks had suggested.|$|R

Despite renewed interest in compulsory purchase, it is unlikely to become the normal remedy for multiple ownership, owing to its cost and complexity. Drawing on international experience and recent research, this article proposes the concept of an Urban Partnership Zone, in which existing landowners would be entitled to participate alongside the local authority and a chosen development partner in a joint-venture redevelopment company. Combined with greater planning certainty and other benefits, this innovation would enable the development process to operate more rapidly without immediate <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase.</b> Brownfield <b>Land,</b> <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Purchase,</b> Development Process, Urban Redevelopment, Multiple Land Ownership, Owner Participation,...|$|R

5000|$|The {{bombing of}} the Basque town of Guernica in Spain by planes of the German Luftwaffe's Condor Legion in 1937 made {{politicians}} realise the potential for destruction in British cities should another war with Germany break out in Europe. As tensions continued to grow, a bill {{was presented to the}} British parliament in March 1939 to promote and facilitate the construction, maintenance and management of camps of a permanent character". The Bill provided funds for <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> <b>purchase</b> and an exemption form Planning restrictions. The camps were to be constructed and administered by the National Camps Corporation, a non-profit making body set up under the Act. A Government letter in 1939 states [...] "I am directed by the Minister of Health to refer to the permanent camps now being erected in England and Wales under the provisions of the Camps Act and to say that he has under consideration the question of whether they should be marked in some distinctive manner to indicate that they are civilian camps, so as to avoid bombing by hostile aircraft in the event of war. In peacetime it is the intention to use these camps as school camps but in time of war they should provide accommodation for some of the civil population evacuated from urban areas" [...] The Camps were to be in quiet attractive, wooded country, so that they would be less obvious from the air, and were not to be built near military or naval establishments, aerodromes or main railway lines. Access was to be good and it would be advantageous to be near a town or village to facilitate catering.Less than three months after the Camps Bill, on 19 June, work started on the first camp at Overton in Hampshire. It was scheduled to be finished on 31 August but was eventually completed in October. Construction at nineteen other sites began and in reply to a House of Commons question on Tuesday 3 October it was stated [...] "construction is in hand". All of the Camps were to be built from Canadian Cedarwood to standard plans and specification. The architects used were Messrs. Sir John Burnet, Tait and Larne of Montagu place, London. The actual designs were made by the modernist architect Thomas S Tait. Each Camp was to accommodate [...] "348 children in six dormitories, together with a hall, a very large dining room with kitchens attached, 4 classrooms, a hospital block for 7 patients and quarters for camp staff, the camp superintendent, and the Headmaster".The total cost of building Sayers Croft was £25,968 comprising construction £14,111, services £8,292, site purchase £1,500, legal fees £15, equipment £1,750 and architects fees of £300.|$|R
25|$|The Crown and {{the colonial}} governments (especially Virginia) {{considered}} the <b>land</b> <b>purchases</b> illegal, and <b>ordered</b> the settlers to leave {{what they considered}} to be Cherokee lands. Also, some factions of the Cherokee became agitated when these settlements began expanding rapidly, and tribal chiefs amiable to the settlers fell out of favor. A young Cherokee chief, Dragging Canoe, who had been opposed to the sale of tribal lands, called for the violent removal of all European settlers west of the mountains. He led an estimated one thousand followers (eventually {{referred to as the}} Chickamauga) away from the American settlements and carried on an armed struggle against the new country for almost twenty more years (see the Cherokee–American wars) after the failed Cherokee attacks against the Overmountain settlements in the summer of 1776.|$|R
40|$|<b>Compulsory</b> <b>land</b> {{acquisition}} is {{an inevitable}} {{phenomenon in the}} process of urbanization in developing countries. To respond to the establishment of Economic Development Zone and the rapid expanding of urban area, lots of land has been acquisitioned in the recent decades in China, as a result of which, large amount of farmers lost their land for agricultural production and living, and have to seek for jobs in non-agricultural sectors. In order to understand the impacts of <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> acquisition on farmers’ livelihood in China, the study, based on the cases at two places in China, could represent the general situation herein. One case is from Xiema Town which is located in Chongqing Municipality, the other is the fieldwork in Dongfanghong Town which is situated in Changsha City. The studies apply both the quantitative and qualitative methods together to explore the situation of affected farmers’ livelihoods before and after the <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> acquisition. The influences of <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> acquisition on farmers’ livelihood are multi-dimensional. Though the affected farmers’ in the two cases demonstrated largely different attitudes to <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> acquisition and the degree of satisfaction about livelihood after <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> acquisition, there are common impacts on their livelihood, such as unsuccessful employment, low social welfare, lack of supporting social network due to the <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> acquisition. Meanwhile, the results revealed that the compensation plays a vital role in their livelihood temporarily after <b>compulsory</b> <b>land</b> acquisition, however, their sustainable livelihood is still worth due consideration...|$|R
