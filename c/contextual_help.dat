5000|$|He {{worked as}} Senior Scientist at Xerox PARC from 1972 until 1984; {{during this time}} he {{designed}} Interlisp. Bill Joy has acknowledged {{that many of the}} ideas in the C shell were inspired by and copied from Interlisp. In Interlisp, Teitelman invented DWIM ("Do What I Mean"), a function that attempted to correct many common typing errors. It was a package of Lisp routines which would [...] "correct errors automatically or with minor user intervention"—thus making the code do what the user meant, not what they wrote. The program was developed based upon Teitelman's own writing style and idiosyncrasies in 1972, and then used by other individuals in his office, followed by users across the industry. In 1977, he and Bob Sproull implemented the first client-server window system, D-Lisp. D-Lisp used the Alto as a display device on which ran the window manager and event handler, communicating with Interlisp running on a MAXC (a PDP-10 clone). This system pioneered such concepts as overlapping windows where the window containing the focus {{did not have to be}} on top to receive events, on-line <b>contextual</b> <b>help,</b> and the ability to cut, copy, and paste from previous commands given to the shell.|$|E
5000|$|Since Projekt Dyabola’s {{interface}} {{is about}} 10 years old, {{a number of}} weaknesses are now becoming apparent, especially when compared to similar, more modern systems. The interface is unintuitive and relies on outdated technologies and paradigms of interaction.For example, once the database is opened in a separate browser pop-up window, there is no description to indicate {{the contents of the}} dataset being searched. These screens also lack <b>contextual</b> <b>help</b> that would aid the user in understanding the available functionality. Another issue is that there are points where a user may like to return to a previous screen, but this option is not made available and the browser's back button is purposely disabled. [...] In addition, the software automatically saves previous searches and makes these available on the main search page, but it does not provide a function for the user to delete these old searches as they begin to clutter up this screen. Finally, when viewing an individual record, a user can also view its subject terms, which are in a hierarchical tree structure, but {{it is not possible to}} directly navigate this tree. These examples provide only a brief sample of the usability issues of the software. The weaknesses of the system can be fully enumerated in comparison with a newer software packages that serves a similar function. An example would be the Endeca faceted-browsing system, as implemented for the library catalog of the Triangle Research Libraries Network (TRLN) in North Carolina.|$|E
