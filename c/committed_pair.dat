25|$|In 1949, the <b>pair</b> <b>committed</b> {{the three}} murders {{for which they}} would later be convicted. Janet Fay, 66, became engaged to Fernandez and went to stay at his Long Island apartment. When Beck caught her in bed with Fernandez, she smashed Fay's head in with a hammer in a murderous rage. Fernandez then strangled Fay. Fay's family became {{suspicious}} when she disappeared, and Fernandez and Beck fled.|$|R
50|$|By burglarizing {{a liquor}} store, Manson {{obtained}} money that {{enabled him to}} rent a room. He committed a string of burglaries of other stores, including one from which he stole a bicycle, but was eventually {{caught in the act}} and sent to an Indianapolis juvenile center. He escaped after one day, but was recaptured and placed in Boys Town. Four days after his arrival there, he escaped with another boy. The <b>pair</b> <b>committed</b> two armed robberies {{on their way to the}} home of the other boy's uncle.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the bodies}} found at 25 Cromwell Street was that of their daughter, Heather, who was murdered in June 1987 {{at the age of}} 16, after being abused by her parents all her life. Barry, her younger brother, would later {{describe}} watching his mother kick Heather repeatedly in the head until she was no longer moving. The Wests told friends and concerned parties that Heather had left home to work at a Devonshire holiday village, and on one occasion, fabricated a phone call, supposedly from Heather, to allay her siblings' suspicions regarding their sister's disappearance. This was the last known murder that the <b>pair</b> <b>committed.</b>|$|R

The present investigation aimed to replicate and extend current research of case linkage, a method that uses across-crime offender behavioural similarity to predict whether crimes belong to a common offender (Woodhams, Hollin, & Bull, 2007). A total of 320 solved residential burglaries were obtained, and three samples, each with 80 pairs of offences were created (linked, unlinked (dependent), unlinked (independent)). Following the method employed by previous researchers, behavioural similarity of linked <b>pairs</b> (<b>committed</b> by the same offender) was compared to unlinked (dependent) <b>pairs</b> (<b>committed</b> by different offenders). Following Woodhams‟ (2008) study of serial juvenile stranger sexual offences, this methodology was extended by also comparing similarity of linked pairs with unlinked (independent) pairs that were matched with the linked pairs on variables that {{have been shown to}} influence the characteristics of burglary offences (e. g. Rengert, 1975, as cited in Rengert, 1989; Snook, 2004). The justification for this methodology is to reduce potentially inflated dissimilarity between unlinked pairs that may have been problematic in previous research. In both analyses (linked versus unlinked (dependent), linked versus unlinked (independent)), distance between burglary locations possessed a high degree of accuracy in distinguishing linked from unlinked pairs. Comparatively, other traditional modus operandi behaviours showed less potential for linkage, in both analyses. The implications of the findings are interpreted and avenues of future research are discussed. University of Leiceste...|$|R
50|$|Thomas and Raymond Highers {{were convicted}} in 1988 {{of first-degree murder}} in the 1987 slaying of Robert Karey, a known Detroit drug dealer and were both {{sentenced to life in}} prison without the {{possibility}} of parole. After serving over 25 years in prison, Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Lawrence Talon vacated the brothers' convictions based on new eye-witness testimony and released the pair on bond. The Wayne County Prosecutor's office said they intended to re-try the brothers, beginning in October 2013. In September 2013, despite maintaining that her office still thought the <b>pair</b> <b>committed</b> the crime, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced that her office was dismissing all charges against the pair.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the new stadium, {{the team}} began the 2006 {{season with a}} 1-8 record, punctuated by a 24-23 loss to the Chicago Bears on October 16 (before a sellout crowd enjoying a rare Cardinals {{appearance}} on Monday Night Football) in which Arizona blew a 20-point lead in an extremely bizarre game as Chicago scored zero offensive touchdowns and the Cardinals led in several statistical categories including Time of Possession, Passing Yardage, Rushing Yardage, Giveaways, Takeaways, and Interceptions. Despite all the overwhelming statistical evidence the Bears capitalized on the two turnovers the Cardinals did <b>commit,</b> a <b>pair</b> of fumbles, and promptly returned them both for touchdowns. They also converted a punt return into a touchdown. The Cardinals {{had a chance to}} redeem themselves with a last minute field goal which would give them the victory, but their offense turned conservative and stalled just past midfield, and a 40-yard field goal attempt by Neil Rackers missed wide left. Afterwards Green fired off an uncharacteristic, angry tirade in the postgame press conference, stating [...] "The Bears are who we thought they were", adding [...] "If you want to crown them, then crown their ass! But they are who we thought they were, and we let 'em off the hook!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Another theory {{suggested}} that the <b>pair</b> <b>committed</b> suicide, or murder-suicide. This theory was bolstered by entries found in both victims' diaries. Excerpts from Tom's personal diary were used to portray a deeply disturbed man who {{was looking for a}} [...] "quick and peaceful" [...] death. Eileen's writings had expressed concern for her well-being, given Tom's [...] "death wish". She had openly chosen to stay with Tom, no matter the outcome. However, the diary entries were taken out of context, according to Eileen's parents and family members. The family, the coroner Noel Nunan, and the Port Douglas police claim that only pages that would validate the suicide theory were leaked to the press, whereas the majority of the diaries remain unread except by the coroner, Port Douglas police, and the Hains family.|$|R

They proceed across the disc, encountering a variety of mythical creatures, most of which lead to near-death experiences for Rincewind. Fortunately for Rincewind, the Octavo spell in his head precludes him from actually dying, resulting in several comic encounters with Death. Meanwhile, a significant power struggle is occurring within the Unseen University. Narrator Brian Cox explains that [...] "in the competitive world of wizardry, {{the way to the top}} is via dead men's pointy shoes... even if you have to empty them yourself". The power-hungry wizard Ymper Trymon (Tim Curry) plans to become Archchancellor. Trymon assassinates several faculty members but is thwarted by the incumbent Archchancellor, Galder Weatherwax, and his superior magical knowledge of the Octavo. Trymon knows there is no point in deposing the Archchancellor until he learns how to control the Octavo, which is growing increasingly restless as Rincewind (and the spell in his head) moves further away from Ankh-Morpork and into greater danger.|$|R

On June 11, 1877, Leroy married for the fifth and final time, this time to prospector and gambler Samuel R. Curley. This marriage, as her others, was volatile. Curley was alleged to have been extremely jealous and Leroy did not help matters, as she had numerous affairs, {{one of which was}} with her latest ex-husband. On the night of December 6, 1877, Curley shot and killed Leroy in the Lone Star Saloon, then turned the gun on himself and <b>committed</b> suicide. The <b>pair</b> were laid in state in front of the saloon the next day, then buried together. The January 7, 1878 issue of the Black Hills Daily Times of Deadwood, under [...] "City and Vicinity", reported: The estate of Kitty Curley upon appraisment, amounted to $650. More than one-half of which is claimed by and allowed to Kitty Donally, and the ezpenses have doubtless consumed the balance. P.H. Earley has been appointed trustee or guardian for the child.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} in North America {{has supported the}} view that male involvement in committed, romantic relationships is associated with lower testosterone (T) levels. Here, we test the prediction that undergraduate men involved in <b>committed,</b> romantic relationships (<b>paired)</b> will have lower T levels than men not involved in such relationships (unpaired). Further, we also test whether these differences are more apparent in samples collected later, rather than earlier, in the day. For this study, 107 undergraduate men filled out a questionnaire and collected one saliva sample (from which a subject’s T level was measured) at various times across the day. As in previous studies, men involved in committed, romantic relationships had lower salivary T levels, though only during later times of the day. Furthermore, additional analysis of the variation among unpaired subjects indicated that men without prior relationship experience had lower T levels than experienced men. Finally, while paired men as a group had lower T levels than unpaired men, those men at the earliest stage (less than six months) of a current relationship had higher T levels than unpaired men {{as well as men}} in longer-term relationships. These results suggest that variation in male testosterone levels may reflect differential behavioral allocation to mating effort...|$|R
5000|$|As {{one of the}} nation's top {{football}} prospects, Perrilloux {{was heavily}} recruited during his high school career. Very early, Louisiana State University and the University of Texas at Austin emerged as the frontrunners for his commitment. On July 26, 2004, Perrilloux verbally <b>committed</b> to Texas, <b>pairing</b> with Colt McCoy as Texas's quarterback recruit. Texas head coach Mack Brown {{had not been able}} to recruit quarterbacks in his past two recruiting classes, since some of the best Texas prep QBs - like Rhett Bomar and Kirby Freeman - committed to out-of-state colleges, which is why Brown was particularly interested in signing Perrilloux. After remaining committed to Texas up to signing day, Perrilloux caved to local pressure publicly announced he would attend Louisiana State to much pomp and circumstance. New LSU head coach Les Miles only had the job for a few weeks, and Perrilloux was considered the cornerstone of a relatively small recruiting class. Perrilloux held a news conference on signing day and proclaimed he would win the Heisman Trophy as a true freshman. A reporter asked him, [...] "What about Jamarcus Russell?" [...] Russell was the current LSU starting QB at the time. Perrilloux made the famous quip [...] "Jamarcus Who?" ...|$|R

Raja's mother has been brutally murdered (by Anupam Kher and his henchman Ranjit) as she witnesses a murder <b>committed</b> by this <b>pair.</b> Sagar takes Raja out to fairs and adventures and Raja sees Ranjit and tries to tell Sagar {{that he is the}} one who murdered his mother. Slowly Sagar understands the tale of the story. He meets a girl Neelam and becomes friends. She takes them to her house. Raja sees a picture of Neelam her father and shockingly his mother. Sagar wants to unfold the mystery of Raja's incident. He finds out that Raja's mother has been murdered. As he is looking for clues, he gets arrested.

50|$|Although he was honoured with a consulship by the Emperor Claudius in 46, and {{he served}} his proconsulship as Governor of the Province of Asia, Silanus {{did not survive}} the death of that Emperor, whom the {{historian}} Tacitus hints was speeded {{on his way to}} Godhood by consuming funghi porcini doused with a dose of poison (infusum delectabili cibo boleto venenum)—said to have been administered at the instigation of the emperor's fourth wife, Agrippina the Younger. Although Tacitus exonerates Nero of Silanus' death, the 'first crime of the new principate,', the historian casts Agrippina, Nero's mother, as the architect of the murder, on the grounds that she feared that Silanus would act as the avenger of his brother's death, of which, Tacitus implies, she was the perpetrator (Agrippina fratri eius L. Silano necem molita ultorem metuebat). As with Claudius, poison was the means to Silanus' end; the epitomator of Dio Cassius' 'Roman History' even tells us that Agrippina sent Silanus the same poison with which she dispatched her late husband; and Tacitus informs us that the lethal drug was administered by a Roman of the Equestrian class named Publius Celerius, {{with the aid of a}} freed slave named Helius. The <b>pair</b> <b>committed</b> the crime openly, and the Province of Asia eventually prosecuted Celerius for this deed, among others; moreover, according to Tacitus, Nero saw to it that the prosecution was delayed to such an extent that Celerius died of old age.|$|R
50|$|During {{his time}} on the run, Newt befriends a teenager, Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow), who he stops from <b>committing</b> suicide. The <b>pair</b> quickly fall in love. Eli takes an instant dislike to Rae and takes over Newt in order to kill her, however Newt stops himself from {{severely}} hurting her. Realising they both cannot escape their troubles, Newt and Rae agree to commit suicide together by jumping into a canal. Lauren tells Jack where Newt is and the pair rush to get him, and are shocked to see him threatening to kill himself. After it is revealed to Newt that Rae is just another persona of his schizophrenia, he pushes Eli into the canal. Rae also jumps in, as does Newt. Jack rushes in to rescue Newt and he pulls him out safely. However, Eli and Rae do not resurface. Newt recovers in hospital and is adamant that Rae is real, despite Jack and Lauren telling him he was alone. Newt is released and discovers a picture of Rae in the purse belonging to Lily, an elderly woman he mugged whilst on the run. Newt goes to Lily's door, where he tells her of Rae's death. Despite this, Rae turns up and tells Newt {{she does not know}} who he is. Newt tries to tell Rae he is telling the truth but she does not believe him. An upset Newt returns home and decides to change, shaving off his hair and changing his clothes, ultimately dropping his emo appearance. Another local school, Abbey Hill, is merged with Hollyoaks High. Rae is one of the new students. Newt tries to talk to her, but she gets her friend Sinclair to scare Newt off. Newt tells Lauren about the Rae he knew whilst on the run. Lauren then tells Newt that the Rae he had described, is exactly like her.|$|R
