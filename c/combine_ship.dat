40|$|The U. S. JGOFS {{is part of}} a major {{international}} field experiment which the National Science Foundation (NSF) is conducting during the decade. It will <b>combine</b> <b>ship</b> and aircraft data collected in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The primary data collected by the Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL) is laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence together with the concurrent laser-induced water Raman backscatter and phycoerythrin fluorescence. Passive solar-induced up-welling radiances and down-welling solar irradiance are also acquired. Results from the 1989 Atlantic mission as well as plans for use of the new long-range Wallops P- 3 during the upcoming Equatorial Pacific mission are presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the second most {{important}} greenhouse gas, methane, moved into the focus of scientific attention for its potential role in feedback processes, for its little understood budget components and for yet unkown production processes. Instrumental advances now allow to directly measure the flux of methane from emitting surfaces into the atmosphere by the eddy correlation technique. In this talk it will be shown how an aircraft can be used to extend the spatial coverage of flux measurements, to analyse the variability of fluxes and to quantify the emission for different arctic regions. The research aircraft Polar 5 was equipped with a turbulence sensor at a noseboom and a fast methane analyser. Thus, eddy correlation measurements of methane fluxes were conducted in northern Alaska, the Mackenziedelta and over the partly ice covered ocean in the Fram Strait. Especially the latter, the measurements over the ice covered ocean, suggest that further campaigns should <b>combine</b> <b>ship</b> and airborne platforms...|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Combined</b> <b>Shipping</b> Adjustment Board or <b>Combined</b> <b>Shipping</b> Board was a joint American-British war agency 1942-45 {{nominally}} {{in charge}} of commercial shipping. It proved ineffective as much more powerful boards, such as the Combined Munitions Assignments Board, ignored it. The U.S. Army and Navy controlled most shipping and refused to share responsibility with the Board as did the powerful War Shipping Administration. For practical purposes the agency was inactive by spring 1943.|$|R

The player who has collected the most parts will control the <b>combined</b> <b>ship's</b> main shot, while the other player (the one with the fewer parts collected) controls the secondary weapon. When the timer runs out or the <b>combined</b> <b>ship</b> takes enough damage, the player's ship will revert to its regular state (along with that of the other player's).|$|R

30|$|Behrend and Meisel [4] analyze a {{platform}} <b>combining</b> <b>shipping</b> requests with community members’ planned trips {{through the development}} of mathematical and heuristic models with the aim of maximizing profits. The results quantify the benefit of integrating item-sharing (i.e. sharing of tools or leisure equipment between community’s members) and crowdshipping as a function of crowdshippers’ detour flexibility and compensations. The opportunity to combine limited flexibilities in a neighborhood delivery turns out to be additionally beneficial, as it provides consumers with access to items that are not reachable through the other modes. Due to these findings, the authors conclude that an integration of item-sharing and crowdshipping has the potential to push collaborative consumption by delivering through the crowd.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of hydroelastic analysis of large and flexible container ships of today is pointed out. A methodology for investigation of this challenging phenomenon is drawn {{up and a}} mathematical model is worked out. It includes defi nition of ship geometry, mass distribution, structure stiffness, and <b>combines</b> <b>ship</b> hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, ship motion and vibrations. Based on the presented theory, a computer program is developed and applied for hydroelastic analysis of a fl exible segmented barge for which model test results of motion and distortion in waves have been available. A correlation analysis of numerical simulation and measured response shows quite good agreement of the transfer functions for heave, pitch, roll, vertical and horizontal bending and torsion. Such checked tool can be further used for reliable ydroelastic analysis of ship-like structures...|$|R
