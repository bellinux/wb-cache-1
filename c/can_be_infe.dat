The potentials employ a definition of nearest neighbor contact based on Delaunay tessellation that identifies quadruplets of neighboring residues. The potentials are derived from a large set of proteins with explicit waters of hydration to improve the representation of the protein environment. The decoy discrimination ability of the three potentials as well as an unhydrated potential are evaluated and compared using four sets of publicly available protein decoy structures.

40|$|Traditional {{economic}} {{theory of the}} consumer assumes the existence of perfect information. However, in reality this assumption is rarely ful-filled. In this paper a model is presented which relaxes this assumption and explicitly introduces the possibility of imperfect information into the theory of consumer behavior. Specifically, {{the focus is on}} consumer decision making when the utility realized from a bundle of goods and services <b>can</b> <b>be</b> different from the utility anticipated during the budget allocation process. It is assumed that a consumer allocates a fixed budget to a bundle of goods and services based on known prices, a set of information about the I goods and services, and his or her perception of the utility to be derived from consumption. If the consumer's knowledge about the goods and services in the consumption bundle is inaccurate at the time of budget allocation, the utility actually realized from consumption will differ from the utility previously perceived. Allocative errors due to imperfect information can occur giving rise to losses in consumer welfare which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to <b>infe...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{sequence}} of AR Lac seasonal light curves covering the period 1967 - 1992 is analysed {{in the framework}} of the starspot hypothesis to derive the spot distribution and evolution on the component stars. The adopted approach makes use of the Maximum Entropy and Tikhonov principles to compute maps of the stellar photospheres exploiting also the eclipse scanning technique. Reliable results on the distribution of the spotted areas <b>can</b> <b>be</b> derived through a critical comparison of the maps obtained by the above quoted regularizing criteria. Satisfactory fits are computed assuming that spots are located on the photospheres of both components and that their unspotted luminosity ratio in the V band is: L 1 L 2 = 0. 59 ± 0. 03.

40|$|Functional {{annotation}} of {{a protein}} sequence {{in the absence}} of experimental data or clear similarity to a sequence of known function is difficult. In this study, a simple set of sequence attributes based on physicochemical and predicted structural characteristics were used as input to machine learning methods. In order to improve performance through increasing the data available for training, a technique of sequence enrichment was explored. These methods were used to predict membership to 24 and 49 large and diverse protein superfamiles from the SCOP database. We found the best performance was obtained using an enriched training dataset. Accuracies of 66. 3 % and 55. 6 % were achieved on datasets comprising 24 and 49 superfamilies with LibSVM and AdaBoostM 1 respectively. The methods used here confirm that domains within superfamilies share global sequence properties. We show machine learning models used to predict categories within the SCOP database <b>can</b> <b>be</b> significantly improved via a simple sequence enrichment step. These approaches <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to complement profile methods for detecting distant relationships where function <b>is</b> difficult to <b>infe...</b>|$|R
40|$|Polycrystalline diamond {{films are}} {{produced}} by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in a r. f. -induction thermal plasma system. A dc bias voltage between - 400 V and + 500 V {{is applied to the}} deposition substrate. This is made possible by maintaining the reactor environment at ground potential and introducing a high-impedance, high-power filter network, eliminating the r. f. voltage drop across the plasma-probe junction. The Ar, H 2, CH 4 plasma (8. 45 % H 2, 0. 21 % CH 4) impinges on a molybdenum substrate probe (5 mm in diameter) in stagnation point flow. The resulting diamond films are analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Raman Spectroscopy. The initial nucleation density is enhanced at negative bias voltage. However, this comes at the expense of degradation in crystalline quality. Positive voltage improves the quality and augments the film growth rate. A threefold increase in linear growth rate is attained at + 500 V as compared to the unbiased case. The growing diamond film is used as an electrical and thermal probe. Electron emission currents from the developing diamond structures are exploited to monitor the film evolution during deposition. Diamond nucleation and growth stages are identified, and the bias voltage is varied in-situ to adjust to the changing growth requirements. A numerical simulation and optical emission spectroscopic measurements are used to characterize the plasma free stream as well as the boundary layer region between the plasma and the substrate. Current-voltage characteristics of the substrate are interpreted, and electrical probe theory is applied. It is shown that at negative bias the plasma-substrate interface is described by an expanding collision-dominated sheath imbedded inside the chemically reacting thermal boundary layer. Contrary to dc arcjet CVD, there is no secondary discharge created in the r. f. system at positive bias voltage. Also, the role of ion bombardment at negative bias is shown to be of little importance. It <b>is</b> <b>infe...</b>|$|R
