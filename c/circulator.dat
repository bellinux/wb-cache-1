It operates {{in the opposite}} direction as the Howard Beach and Jamaica branches, making a continuous clockwise loop around the terminals. Connections to the Q3, Q10 and B15 local buses are available at Terminal 5.|$|E
5|$|Service on the Lake Shore Limited {{consists}} of reserved coach seating and Viewliner sleepers, {{as well as}} amenities like a dining car service. As the Erie station is not equipped with a ticket office, nor Amtrak's Quik-Trak ticket machines, all tickets from the station have to be pre-paid. The station is, however, equipped with a waiting room and public restrooms. The Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority's Route 20A, the downtown <b>circulator,</b> provides service between the station and downtown Erie. The bus only operates, however, at the scheduled arrival time of the eastbound Lake Shore Limited.|$|E

50|$|Depending on the {{materials}} involved, <b>circulators</b> {{fall into two}} main categories: ferrite <b>circulators</b> and nonferrite <b>circulators.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early work on nonferrite <b>circulators</b> {{includes}} active <b>circulators</b> using transistors {{that are}} non-reciprocal in nature. In contrast to ferrite <b>circulators</b> which are passive devices, active <b>circulators</b> require power. Major {{issues associated with}} transistor-based active <b>circulators</b> are the power limitation and the signal-to-noise degradation, which are critical when it {{is used as a}} duplexer for sustaining the strong transmit power and clean reception of the signal from the antenna.|$|R

50|$|Finally, he argued, even if Colorado had a {{compelling}} interest in identifying <b>circulators,</b> the reporting requirement {{did not serve}} that purpose: it only required the names of paid <b>circulators,</b> not all <b>circulators.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1993, {{under the}} laws of the time, <b>circulators</b> were also {{required}} to be registered voters of Colorado, and at least eighteen years old. Circulation times for initiatives and referenda were limited to only six months; and <b>circulators</b> were required to sign affidavits that showed their names and addresses, including their country of residence. Furthermore, all <b>circulators</b> had to identify whether they were being paid to circulate the petition though an identification card, which also displayed their names, and the telephone number of their employer (if they were being paid). Finally, proponent-employers also had to report, on a monthly basis, their names, the names and addresses of paid <b>circulators,</b> circulators' monthly salary and debt totals, and the name of each proposed ballot measure; likewise, when an initiative was filed with the Secretary of State of Colorado, a report was required from the proponents, detailing the amount of money paid per signature, the total payment to <b>circulators,</b> and the personal information (including name, address, and county of voter registration) of any paid <b>circulators.</b>|$|R

25|$|Most EPR {{machines}} are reflection spectrometers, {{meaning that the}} detector should only be exposed to microwave radiation {{coming back from the}} cavity. This is achieved by the use of a device known as the <b>circulator</b> which directs the microwave radiation (from the branch that is heading towards the cavity) into the cavity. Reflected microwave radiation (after absorption by the sample) is then passed through the <b>circulator</b> towards the detector, ensuring it does not go back to the microwave source. The reference signal and reflected signal are combined and passed to the detector diode which converts the microwave power into an electrical current.|$|E

50|$|Second, the {{registration}} requirement operated much like Colorado's ban on paid <b>circulators</b> — which the Court had struck down in Meyer v. Grant (1988), ten years before. Though neither directly regulated speech, both still limited {{the number of}} potential speakers, and thus, {{the size of the}} audience that <b>circulators</b> might reach. Furthermore, the compelling interest, ensuring that <b>circulators</b> are voters, was defeated by the fact that many Colorado residents were not voters, and that a residency requirement would be far more narrowly tailored and serve the government interest better.|$|R

25|$|A {{proponent of}} {{increased}} international trade, Morrison lent his {{support to the}} construction of the International Trade Mart - precursor to the city's World Trade Center. He traveled extensively in Latin America to promote trade with New Orleans. He became friends with dictators Rafael Trujillo and Juan Perón. Morrison's wish to reinforce ties with Latin America was expressed in such urban renewal projects as having new central area circulators embellished with monuments to Central and South American historical figures. The widened Basin Street was outfitted with monuments to Simón Bolívar, Benito Juárez, and Francisco Morazán. A statue of Bolívar was prominently sited and still stands at the corner of Canal and Basin streets. A new <b>circulator</b> in Central City was renamed Simon Bolivar Avenue.|$|E
25|$|The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) is a state-operated {{mass transit}} {{administration}} in Maryland, and {{is part of}} the Maryland Department of Transportation. It is better known as MTA Maryland to avoid confusion with other cities' transit agencies who share the initials MTA. The MTA operates a comprehensive transit system throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. There are 80 bus lines serving Baltimore's public transportation needs, along with other services that include the Light Rail, Metro Subway, and MARC Train. With nearly half the population of Baltimore residents lacking access to a car, the MTA {{is an important part of}} the regional transit picture.
