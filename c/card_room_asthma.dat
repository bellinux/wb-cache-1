50|$|Since {{games played}} in <b>card</b> <b>rooms</b> are usually player-against-player instead of player-against-house, <b>card</b> <b>room</b> {{operators}} typically derive their revenues {{in one of}} two ways.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} how women card dealers made meaning of their work in a California <b>card</b> <b>room</b> casino. Ethnography and 10 qualitative open-ended, semi-structured interviews were utilized to understand the gendered and sexualized nature {{of work in the}} <b>card</b> <b>room.</b> The <b>card</b> <b>room</b> in this study was a male dominated space where traditional gender norms are fully emphasized. The female card dealers emphasized their beauty and other hetero-normative interactions with card players to generate tips. However, this gendered game had challenges for the participants, such as when the management did not protect their safety or personal space with overly aggressive customers. This study found that emotion work is a large part of how the women gain, keep, and negotiate power within this industry. The research is a micro-analysis of the larger societal problems that are related to our society from inequality of the work place, patriarchy, gender stereotypes, women as objects, and violence against women.
