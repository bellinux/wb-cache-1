40|$|The Z pulsed-power {{generator}} at Sandia National Laboratories drives {{high energy}} density physics experiments with load currents of up to 26 MA. Z utilizes a double post-hole <b>convolute</b> to combine the current from four parallel magnetically insulated transmission lines into a single transmission line just upstream of the load. Current loss is observed in most experiments and is traditionally attributed to inefficient <b>convolute</b> performance. The apparent loss current varies substantially for z-pinch loads with different inductance histories; however, a similar <b>convolute</b> impedance history is observed for all load types. This paper details direct spectroscopic measurements of plasma density, temperature, and apparent and actual plasma closure velocities within the <b>convolute.</b> Spectral measurements indicate a correlation between impedance collapse and plasma formation in the <b>convolute.</b> Absorption features in the spectra show the <b>convolute</b> plasma consists primarily of hydrogen, which likely forms from desorbed electrode contaminant species such as H_{ 2 }O, H_{ 2 }, and hydrocarbons. Plasma densities increase from 1 × 10 ^{ 16 }[*][*]cm^{− 3 } (level of detectability) just before peak current to over 1 × 10 ^{ 17 }[*][*]cm^{− 3 } at stagnation (tens of ns later). The density seems to be highest near the cathode surface, with an apparent cathode to anode plasma velocity {{in the range of}} 35 – 50 [*][*]cm/μs. Similar plasma conditions and <b>convolute</b> impedance histories are observed in experiments with high and low losses, suggesting that losses are driven largely by load dynamics, which determine the voltage on the <b>convolute...</b>|$|R
40|$|Vacuum-post-hole <b>convolutes</b> {{are used}} in pulsed {{high-power}} generators to join several magnetically insulated transmission lines (MITL) in parallel. Such <b>convolutes</b> add the output currents of the MITLs, and deliver the combined current to a single MITL that, in turn, delivers the current to a load. Magnetic insulation of electron flow, established upstream of the <b>convolute</b> region, is lost at the <b>convolute</b> due to symmetry breaking {{and the formation of}} magnetic nulls, resulting in some current losses. At very high-power operating levels and long pulse durations, the expansion of electrode plasmas into the MITL of such devices is considered likely.

40|$|Quasiequilibrium {{power flow}} in two radial magnetically {{insulated}} transmission lines (MITLs) coupled to a vacuum post-hole <b>convolute</b> is studied at 50 [*][*]TW– 200 [*][*]TW using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The key physical dimensions {{in the model}} {{are based on the}} ZR accelerator [D. [*]H. McDaniel, et al., Proceedings of 5 th International Conference on Dense Z-Pinches, edited by J. Davis (AIP, New York, 2002), p.   23]. The voltages assumed for this study result in electron emission from all cathode surfaces. Electrons emitted from the MITL cathodes upstream of the <b>convolute</b> cause a portion of the MITL current to be carried by an electron sheath. Under the simplifying assumptions made by the simulations, it is found that the transition from the two MITLs to the <b>convolute</b> results in the loss of most of the sheath current to anode structures. The loss is quantified as a function of radius and correlated with Poynting vector stream lines which would be followed by individual electrons. For a fixed MITL-convolute geometry, the current loss, defined to be the difference between the total (i. e. anode) current in the system upstream of the <b>convolute</b> and the current delivered to the load, increases with both operating voltage and load impedance. It is also found that in the absence of ion emission, the <b>convolute</b> is efficient when the load impedance is much less than the impedance of the two parallel MITLs. The effects of space-charge-limited (SCL) ion emission from anode surfaces are considered for several specific cases. Ion emission from anode surfaces in the <b>convolute</b> is found to increase the current loss by a factor of 2 – 3. When SCL ion emission is allowed from anode surfaces in the MITLs upstream of the <b>convolute,</b> substantially higher current losses are obtained.

Pulsed power drivers, which produce the high current, typically utilize vacuum transmission lines to deliver the electrical pulse to the load. In order to achieve the desired peak current and risetime, several transmission lines are often used in parallel; currents from the transmission lines are summed at the load using a post-hole <b>convolute.</b> Post-hole <b>convolute</b> designs have not changed significantly over the last 30 years despite the considerable increase in the power passing through them. After recent upgrades to Sandia’s Z-Machine (the world’s largest pulsed power driver), {{the efficiency of the}} <b>convolute</b> decreased to an unacceptable level. Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of the system appear to accurately describe the losses observed, but are not yet benchmarked to be predictive. In this dissertation, experimental investigations of plasma formation within a post-hole <b>convolute</b> have been conducted both on a university scale accelerator (~ 1 MA, 100 GW, Linear Transformer Driver or LTD) and on the Z-Machine (~ 20 MA, 100 TW).
