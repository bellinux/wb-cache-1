30|$|The {{main reasons}} for {{restructuring}} the airport network in the Helgeland region centre round realizing the potential positive effects related to trade and bettering competitive conditions for businesses. A new joint airport will offer considerable positive <b>catalytic</b> <b>effects</b> for the business community in general - and particularly the tourism and manufacturing industry. Direct flight connections to/from Oslo lower the barriers related to distance for establishing and maintaining contact with suppliers, customers and authorities. The international trend of higher travel frequency related to vacations with shorter duration revealed by travel studies e.g. [27] makes direct connections a critical success criterion for the tourism industry. It is reasonable to expect that these <b>catalytic</b> <b>effects</b> will be substantial if a direct connection to Oslo is established. The positive <b>catalytic</b> <b>effects</b> will stand out even more prominently if the road infrastructure is improved, providing better accessibility within the region.|$|R
2500|$|Nanotechnology is {{an example}} of a new, {{relatively}} unstudied technology. A Swiss survey of one hundred thirty eight companies using or producing nanoparticulate matter in 2006 resulted in forty completed questionnaires. [...] Sixty five per cent of respondent companies stated they did not have a formal risk assessment process for dealing with nanoparticulate matter. Nanotechnology already presents new issues for OSH professionals that will only become more difficult as nanostructures become more complex. [...] The size of the particles renders most containment and personal protective equipment ineffective. [...] The toxicology values for macro sized industrial substances are rendered inaccurate due to the unique nature of nanoparticulate matter. [...] As nanoparticulate matter decreases in size its relative surface area increases dramatically, increasing any <b>catalytic</b> <b>effect</b> or chemical reactivity substantially versus the known value for the macro substance. [...] This presents a new set of challenges in the near future to rethink contemporary measures to safeguard the health and welfare of employees against a nanoparticulate substance that most conventional controls have not been designed to manage.|$|E

A new interactive method to investigate <b>catalytic</b> <b>effects</b> using differential transition state stabilization approach (DTSS) [1, 2] is presented. The catalytic properties of the active site of cytidine deaminase (E. C. 3. 5. 4. 5) is visualized in the form of differential electrostatic properties. The visualization was implemented using scripting interface of VMD [3]. Cumulative Atomic Multipole Moments (CAMM) [4, 5, 6] were utilized for efficient yet accurate evaluation of the electrostatic properties.

Gradual addition of sodium didecyl phosphate (C 10 C 10 -) {{leads to the}} formation of catanionic vesicles, which were characterized by cryo-electron microscopy, and their main phase transition temperatures (DSC) and xi-potentials. Increasing percentages of C 10 C 10 - in the vesicular bilayers decrease the catalysis of the Kemp elimination. A detailed kinetic analysis, supported by consideration of substrate binding site polarities and counterion binding percentages, suggest that the <b>catalytic</b> <b>effects</b> of C 18 C 18 +/C 10 C 10 - catanionic vesicles are primarily determined by the binding of catalytically active hydroxide ions to the vesicular surface area. The formation of neutral microdomains between 10 and 30 mol% of C 10 C 10 - in the bilayer, as revealed by DSC, is not apparent from the <b>catalytic</b> <b>effects</b> found for these vesicles. Interestingly, the <b>catalytic</b> <b>effects</b> observed for 50 mol% C 10 C 10 - in the catanionic vesicles indicate an asymmetric distribution Of C 18 C 18 + and C 10 C 10 - over the bilayer leaflets.

Supercritical water {{gasification}} (SCWG) of {{food waste}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the effects of increasing alkali catalysts (NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH) 2, Na 2 CO 3, NaHCO 3 and K 2 CO 3) concentration on hydrogen yield. Food waste containing twenty-eight different Chinese food items was gasified at a temperature of 400 °C (held for 10 mins) and pressure of 24 MPa. The basicity of the reacting medium was an underlying factor influencing {{the effects of the}} different alkali catalysts concentrations on the hydrogen yield. In this study, KOH generally had the highest <b>catalytic</b> <b>effects</b> on hydrogen yield. Additionally, increasing the concentration of alkali catalystssignificantly suppressed the CO 2 content in the product gases. Suppression of CO 2 by NaOH and KOH was due to their <b>catalytic</b> <b>effects</b> during the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) in order to increase the hydrogen yield. Suppression of CO 2 by carbonates on the other hand was due to their <b>catalytic</b> <b>effects</b> on the methanation reaction, thereby hindering the WGSR and resulting in lower hydrogen yields.
