2500|$|In the Standard Model, the Higgs {{particle}} is a boson with no spin, electric charge, or <b>colour</b> <b>charge.</b> It is {{also very}} unstable, decaying into other particles almost immediately. It is a quantum excitation {{of one of the}} four components of the Higgs field. The latter constitutes a scalar field, with two neutral and two electrically charged components that form a complex doublet of the weak isospin SU(2) symmetry. The Higgs field has a [...] "Mexican hat-shaped" [...] potential. Consequently, the field in its ground state has a nonzero value everywhere (including otherwise empty space), and below a very high energy it breaks the weak isospin symmetry of the electroweak interaction. (Technically the non-zero expectation value converts the Lagrangian's Yukawa coupling terms into mass terms). When this happens, three components of the Higgs field are [...] "absorbed" [...] by the SU(2) and U(1) gauge bosons (the [...] "Higgs mechanism") to become the longitudinal components of the now-massive W and Z bosons of the weak force. The remaining electrically neutral component either manifests as a Higgs particle, or may couple separately to other particles known as fermions (via Yukawa couplings), causing these to acquire mass as well. Some versions of the theory predicted more than one kind of Higgs fields and bosons. Alternative [...] "Higgsless" [...] models were considered until the discovery of the Higgs boson.|$|E

40|$|When several {{identical}} <b>colour</b> <b>charges</b> {{appear in}} gluon cascades, problems arise {{in describing the}} confinement structure. In model descriptions of gluon emissions and how partons couple some approximations may be less accurate, and neglected contributions may become important when equal <b>colour</b> <b>charges</b> interfere. These charges give rise to new interesting connections between the partons which result in a different distribution of the hadrons which are finally produced. Events which contain gluons with the same colour have some probability to form gluon singlets. Using the string picture several ways to draw the string are possible. A closed string of gluons can appear which would induce {{a gap in the}} rapidity distribution. This can be observed experimentally.

This is the explanation for a diverse range of subatomic particle behavior and phenomena: from the electronic configurations of atoms, nuclei (and therefore all elements on the periodic table and their chemistry), to the quark configurations and <b>colour</b> <b>charge</b> (hence the properties of baryons and mesons).|$|E

In a pentaquark, the colours also need to cancel out, and the only feasible combination is to have one quark with one colour (e.g. red), one quark with a second colour (e.g. green), two quarks with the third colour (e.g. blue), and one antiquark to counteract the surplus colour (e.g. antiblue).|$|E

40|$|A baryon anomaly – an {{increased}} baryon-to-meson production ratio at intermediate pT in heavyion collisions {{when compared to}} pp collisions – is observed at RHIC and the LHC. This effect is usually explained by recombination of constituent quarks during QGP hadronization, or {{as a consequence of}} a strong radial flow developed during the heavy-ion collision. In this contribution, an additional mechanism to favour baryon over meson production is proposed: when hadrons are formed in the recombination of nearby quarks and antiquarks, only colour-singlet combinations can be chosen. Hadron formation, in particular the probability to create baryons or mesons, depends on the distribution of <b>colour</b> <b>charges</b> among quarks. If the distribution is random – a reasonable assumption for Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP) – the baryon-to-meson ratio is nearly twice higher than in the situation where quark colours are pre-arranged to obtain a white hadron in the combination of nearest quarks and antiquarks. The correlation of <b>colour</b> <b>charges</b> in the QGP also influences the distance over which recombination occurs.

50|$|A quark {{is a type}} of {{elementary}} particle that has mass, electric charge, and <b>colour</b> <b>charge,</b> as well as an additional property called flavour, which describes what type of quark it is (up, down, strange, charm, top, or bottom). Due to an effect known as colour confinement, quarks are never seen on their own. Instead, they form composite particles known as hadrons so that their colour charges cancel out. Hadrons made of one quark and one antiquark are known as mesons, while those made of three quarks are known as baryons. These 'regular' hadrons are well documented and characterized, however, there is nothing in theory to prevent quarks from forming 'exotic' hadrons such as tetraquarks with two quarks and two antiquarks, or pentaquarks with four quarks and one antiquark.|$|E
50|$|In {{physical}} cosmology, {{assuming that}} nature {{is described by}} a Grand unification theory, the grand unification epoch was the period {{in the evolution of}} the early universe following the Planck epoch, starting at about 10−43 seconds after the Big Bang, in which the temperature of the universe was comparable to the characteristic temperatures of grand unified theories. If the grand unification energy is taken to be 1015 GeV, this corresponds to temperatures higher than 1027 K. During this period, three of the four fundamental interactions—electromagnetism, the strong interaction, and the weak interaction—were unified as the electronuclear force. Gravity had separated from the electronuclear force at the end of the Planck era. During the grand unification epoch, physical characteristics such as mass, charge, flavour and <b>colour</b> <b>charge</b> were meaningless.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{electromagnetic}} dual theory {{the roles}} of electric and magnetic fields are interchanged.

In a dual superconductor an analogous effect occurs through the condensation of magnetic charges (also called magnetic monopoles). In ordinary electromagnetic theory, no monopoles have been shown to exist. However, in quantum chromodynamics — the theory of <b>colour</b> <b>charge</b> which explains the strong interaction between quarks — the colour charges can be viewed as (non-abelian) analogues of electric charges and corresponding magnetic monopoles are known to exist.
