5|$|In the 1st century BCE and {{the first}} half of that century, it was the Mediterranean port of the Nabateans, whose caravans arrived there from Petra or from Elath on the Red Sea. In 96 BCE, the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus besieged the city for a year. The inhabitants, who had hoped for help from the Nabatean king Aretas II, were killed and their city {{destroyed}} by Jannaeus when Aretas did not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> aid.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of May, the {{situation}} for the 50,000 Arab inhabitants {{of the city and}} the 30,000–40,000 in the outlying neighbourhoods was no better. After the massacre at Deir Yassin and the Jewish offensive of April that triggered the large-scale exodus of the Palestinian Arabs in other mixed cities, the Arab population of Jerusalem was frightened and feared for its fate. With the departure of the British on 14 May, the Haganah launched several operations to take control {{of the city and the}} local Arab leadership requested King Abdullah of Jordan to deploy his army to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> aid.|$|E
5|$|Defying the king, between 12February and 20April 1642, each county {{delegation}} of England in Commons chose two divines, {{in addition to}} two for each county of Wales, four for London, and two for each University (Oxford and Cambridge). County delegations often chose divines from their own county, but not always. Commons chose the members in this {{way to ensure that}} their local constituencies were represented in the decision. The House of Lords, Parliament's upper house, added another fourteen names on 14May, to which Commons agreed. Meanwhile, relations continued to deteriorate between the king and Parliament. Charles raised the royal standard at Nottingham on 22August, marking the beginning of the First English Civil War. The start of the war lent support to the cause of the Assembly in Parliament, because holding it would convince the Scots that Parliament was serious about reforming the church and induce the Scots to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> aid. On the other hand, the war added strain to the already busy Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{numerous}} attempts {{to break through}} the defensive line and reach Lechaeum, Antigonus' force failed and suffered considerable losses. These defeats took such a toll on Antigonus that he considered abandoning his attack of the palisade and moving his army to Sicyon. However, Aratus was visited one evening by some friends from Argos who invited Antigonus to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> city. The Argives were ready to revolt under the command of Aristoteles, as they were irritated that Cleomenes had not made any reforms in the city. Antigonus sent 1,500 men under the command of Aratus to sail to Epidaurus and, from there, march to Argos. At the same time the Achaean strategos for the year, Timoxenos, advanced with more men from Sicyon. When the Achaean reinforcements arrived, the entire city except for the citadel was {{in the hands of the}} Argives.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} summer of 993, Manjutakin {{launched}} yet another expedition, capturing Apamea and Larissa (Ar. Shayzar) and continuing his raids in the Byzantine province around Antioch, before returning safely to Damascus. In spring 994, Manjutakin once more moved against Aleppo. Responding to the calls for aid by the Hamdanids, Basil II ordered Bourtzes to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> aid, and sent the magistors Leo Melissenos with reinforcements to Syria. The Byzantine army however was surprised and heavily defeated when attacked on two flanks by Manjutakin in a battle at {{the banks of the}} Orontes, on 15 September 994. Manjutakin went on to capture Azaz and continued his siege of Aleppo until the personal intervention of Basil II in a lightning campaign the next year. These failures, as well as accusations that he had exacerbated the conflict by imprisoning the Fatimid ambassador in 992, brought Basil's displeasure upon Bourtzes, who was replaced with Damian Dalassenos.|$|E
5|$|The 1947 Sun Bowl was the Bearcats' first {{official}} bowl game, but two 1902 post-season games in New Orleans, Louisiana, {{may be considered}} the first bowl games in Cincinnati football history. In 1902, Cincinnati completed a 7-1-1 season, losing only to the Carlisle Indians. Following the conclusion of its football schedule, the Bearcats were invited to New Orleans by the Southern Athletic Club to play a football game on New Year's Day. Cincinnati easily defeated the Athletic Club team, and at the victory party following the win, students from nearby Louisiana State University invited the Cincinnati players to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> school to play another game. That game, which took place a few days later, resulted in a 22–0 Cincinnati win, and may be considered the first bowl game.|$|E

5|$|The {{head of the}} Black Dragons (David Carradine, {{credited}} as Grand Master), pays a {{visit to}} Guam to take the matter into his own hands. It turns out {{that he is a}} man prominently seen ringside in Max's flashbacks. The Black Dragons kidnap Christy, enticing Max and Jane to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> hideout. Max and Grand Master reach an agreement that Max will fight Arnold Chon's character to death. If Max wins, Max and the Goody sisters can go free. Max almost deals a deadly blow to the enforcer's head, but stops himself at the last moment, sparing his life, yet winning the fight. He turns over the urn to the yakuza, and receives a priceless katana as a gift. Max and his allies celebrate the end of the adventure in a party. The film ends with Max embracing Jane Goody on a beach during sunset.|$|E
5|$|Victory {{joined the}} British fleet off Cádiz on 27 September, Nelson taking over from Rear Admiral Collingwood. He spent the {{following}} weeks preparing and refining his tactics for the anticipated battle and dining with his captains {{to ensure they}} understood his intentions. Nelson had devised a plan of attack that anticipated the allied fleet would form up in a traditional line of battle. Drawing on his own experience from the Nile and Copenhagen, and the examples of Duncan at Camperdown and Rodney at the Saintes, Nelson decided to split his fleet into squadrons rather than forming it into a similar line parallel to the enemy. These squadrons would then cut the enemy's line {{in a number of}} places, allowing a pell-mell battle to develop in which the British ships could overwhelm and destroy parts of their opponents' formation, before the unengaged enemy ships could <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> aid.|$|E
5|$|The story {{followed}} an unnamed warrior {{who became the}} player's character in the multiplayer mode. The warrior {{was a native of}} Kirra whose father was killed by a cruel general who poisoned the water supply of the village, killing many people. Before dying, the warrior's father beckoned him to honor the gods and swear to never let harm <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> family. The warrior swore his father's oath and was met by a cloaked figure, The Giver, who guided him and followed him throughout his journey. Soon after, the warrior called upon Ares to save his people from the poisonous water; the god destroyed the aqueduct and water wheel that supplied water to the village. The warrior then encountered the surviving soldiers who had been under his father's command. One soldier told the warrior that swords alone could not defeat the general. The warrior and his men traveled to the land of Aeaea and recruited the witch Circe, who seemingly also sought revenge against the general. Circe granted the soldiers magical weapons to aid them on their journey, and suggested that they see the Oracle of Delphi to discover whether the general had any weaknesses. During this time, the warrior vowed loyalty to Poseidon and to protect his men.|$|E

25|$|An {{effective}} female {{strategy is}} {{the employment of}} protection and alliances. Some females, such as wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulate) associate themselves with protective males who <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> rescue. This also occurs in hamadryas, savanna, and olive baboons, where males and females form friendships where the female gets male protection. In northern elephant seals, the females give loud cries when mounted by undesirable or subordinate males, which attract dominant males to help. A similar phenomenon occurs in elephants, bighorn sheep, and fallow deer, where the females stay close to dominant males for protection.|$|E

Caesar's informants advised him that whichever tribe Caesar attacked first, the others would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> defence. They broke camp shortly before midnight. At daybreak, satisfied the retreat was not a trap, Caesar sent cavalry to harass the rear guard, followed by three legions. Many of the Belgae were killed in battle.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{because of}} the {{pressure}} of this European encroachment, some Tlingit appealed to the Russian Orthodox Church. It had given services in northern Tlingit settlements in local languages since 1800 and 1824. One of its priests had translated scripture and liturgy into the Tlingit language in the 1830s–1840s. The Tlingit arranged for an Orthodox priest to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> settlement in Juneau. In 1890, some 700 people converted, following chief Yees Gaanaalx and his wife of Auke Bay. The Orthodox Church Missionary Society supported the Tlingit in furnishing and constructing a church for this large congregation.|$|E
