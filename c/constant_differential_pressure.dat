40|$|A two-fluid {{accumulator}} {{has been}} designed, built, and demonstrated {{to provide an}} acceptably close approximation to <b>constant</b> <b>differential</b> static <b>pressure</b> between two fluids over the full ranges of (1) accumulator stroke, (2) rates of flow of the fluids, and (3) common static pressure applied to the fluids. Prior differential- pressure two-fluid accumulators are generally not capable of maintaining acceptably close approximations to <b>constant</b> <b>differential</b> <b>pressures.</b> The inadequacies of a typical prior differential-pressure two-fluid accumulator can be summarized as follows: The static <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> is governed by the intrinsic spring rate (essentially, the stiffness) of an accumulator tank. The spring rate can be tailored through selection of the tank-wall thickness, selection of the number and/or shape of accumulator convolutions, and/or selection of accumulator material(s). Reliance on the intrinsic spring rate of the tank results in three severe limitations: (1) The spring rate and the expulsion efficiency tend to be inversely proportional to each other: that is to say, as the stiffness (and thus the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure)</b> is increased, the range of motion of the accumulator is reduced. (2) As the applied common static <b>pressure</b> increases, the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> tends to decrease. An additional disadvantage, {{which may or may}} not be considered limiting, depending on the specific application, is that an increase in stiffness entails an increase in weight. (3) The additional weight required by a low expulsion efficiency accumulator eliminates the advantage given to such gas storage systems. The high expulsion efficiency provided by this two-fluid accumulator allows for a lightweight, tightly packaged system, which can be used in conjunction with a fuel cell-based system...|$|R

Porosity and permeability are two important properties that define the quality of a reservoir. Porosity was measured, with gas or brine, for 24 core plugs and ranges between φ= 14. 2 - 26. 0 %. Absolute permeability, measured with constant rate injection of brine, gas or oil, ranges between K= 0. 002 - 0. 820 mD. Permeability varied with injected fluid, and gas porosity and permeability were on average higher than measured with brine. Local heterogeneities within core plugs identified with CT imaging significantly influenced the measured reservoir properties. Oil recovery potential and multiphase flow properties were measured on 12 LRQC core plugs.

Two types of laboratory experiments were conducted. These experiments are shown below:(1) Conventional batch-reaction experiments of cement cores in the system of CO 2 and simulated formation water as 0. 5 M NaCl, at 50 and 70 C, 5, 8, 18 MPa for 100 - 1600 hr. In this experiment, individual cement cores are allowed to react with wet CO 2 and NaCl solution charged in titanium reaction vessels with PTFE separators. (2) CO 2 -injection reaction involving casing (API Grade J- 55) -cement (API class A) and cement (API class A) -shale composites which were saturated with 0. 5 M NaCl solution. As a counter experiment for batch experiments, zero CO 2 runs for these cements were additionally carried out at 50 and 70 C at 5 MPa for 100 and 400 hr.

40|$|As {{deep space}} {{exploration}} {{continues to be}} the goal of NASAs human spaceflight program, verification of the performance of spaceflight hardware becomes increasingly critical. Suitable test methods for verifying the leak rate of sealing systems are identified in program qualification testing requirements. One acceptable method for verifying the air leak rate of gas pressure seals is the tracer gas leak detector method. In this method, a tracer gas (commonly helium) leaks past the test seal and is transported to the leak detector where the leak rate is quantified. To predict the air leak rate, a conversion factor of helium-to-air is applied depending on the magnitude of the helium flow rate. The conversion factor is based on either the molecular mass ratio or the ratio of the dynamic viscosities. The current work was aimed at validating this approach for permeation-level leak rates using a series of tests with a silicone elastomer O-ring. An established pressure decay method with <b>constant</b> <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> was used to evaluate both the air and helium leak rates of the O-ring under similar temperature and pressure conditions. The results from the pressure decay tests showed, for the elastomer O-ring, that neither the molecular flow nor the viscous flow helium-to-air conversion factors were applicable. Leak rate tests were also performed using nitrogen and argon as the test gas. Molecular mass and viscosity based helium-to-test gas conversion factors were applied, but did not correctly predict the measured leak rates of either gas. To further this study, the effect of pressure boundary conditions was investigated. Often, pressure decay leak rate tests are performed at a differential pressure of 101. 3 kPa with atmospheric pressure on the downstream side of the test seal. In space applications, the differential pressure is similar, but with vacuum as the downstream pressure. The same O-ring was tested at four unique differential pressures ranging from 34. 5 to 137. 9 kPa. Up to six combinations of upstream and downstream pressures for each differential pressure were compared. For a given differential pressure, the various combinations of upstream and downstream dry air pressures did not significantly affect the leak rate. As expected, the leak rate of the O-ring increased with increasing differential pressure. The results suggested that the current leak test pressure conditions, used to verify spacecraft sealing systems with elastomer seals, produce accurate values even though the boundary conditions do not model the space application...|$|E

Sustainable development is possible through energy as well. As known, it appears that upper limits are approached in pump efficiencies and the potential improvements could not be more than a few points. The energy saved through efficiency improvements of pumping systems is related with proper selection, using of pump and the improvement of system design. The dependence on energy is increasing consistently due to the growing world population, development of new technologies and industrialization race. During the past several decades, studies for improving of existing systems has been a popular issue, regarding to increasing demand on energy, high cost and insufficiency of new energy investments. During the past several decades, environmental consciousness of the population has increased dramatically and mankind started to question his effects on the environment. In connection this issues, not just the society but also the customers started to question the environmental effects of the products they use. Increasingly every year, consumers demand low carbon foot print products, which lead manufacturers to produce items that does not harm the environment. As a result energy efficiency on circulation pumps starts to become obsolete and a new research and development processes has been developed. Today energy efficiency {{is one of the}} most important subjects for circulation pumps. High efficient pumps are started to use because of both legal regulations. In particular, the regulations made by the government about energy efficiency, such as incentives and legal obligations, led to increase energy efficiency efforts. Energy Efficiency Law, The Energy Performance of Buildings Regulation, Increasing Efficiency Regulation on Using Energy and Energy Resources and Renewable Energy Law are the examples of these efforts. All these regulations and increasing energy prices have the companies to come up new energy efficiency efforts. Variable speed drive systems have become a popular and widely used application on account of their energy saving features and simple usage in the market. Energy consumption and overall life cycle costs of equipment are reduced significantly, permitting operators to run the same production with much less energy. This becomes all the more topical in view of high energy prices and the unacceptability of the energy related emissions on the one hand, and the industrial requirements of fast growing economies. Pumping applications represent a significant opportunity for applying variable speed drives in new, as well as retrofit installations. The majority of pumping applications need to be controlled. It is unlikely that a pump will run continuously at a maximum speed. Variable speed drives are crucial when limiting the life cycle costs of a pump station. The three main costs are energy, initial investment an maintenance. Many analyses show that energy consumption is the dominating element of the life cycle costs. The investment cost of the equipment needed (variable speed drives, motors and pumps) is relatively low when compared to the total life cycle costs. Maintenance is the third main cost component. Active control using a variable speed drive works as a means of preventive maintenancei limiting maintenance costs in many ways. Variable speed control has several benefits in pumping applications. The most important is energy saving. Accurate control of the pump system is another benefit. The use of variable speed drives in pumping applications with variable duty requirements provides the user with a variety of benefits, including potentially significant energy saving and improved reliability achieved by means of speed reduction and avoding part flow operation. Energy savings are primarily realized by running the equipment at high levels of efficiency and optimal operating speeds, matching the generated pump head to the exact system requirements without the use of energy consuming control valves. Running pumps at lower operating speeds and avoiding part flow operation also positively influences component life and between maintenance intervals. The primary mechanical challenge of any variable speed drive application is the wide continuous operating speed range. During the past 10 years, the cost os variable speed devices have come down significantly due to the advances in technology, which allowed widespread applications of variable speed pumps. An increased issue associated with the use of variable speed pumps is to control and optimization of their operation. As a result, in terms of enhancing the operating efficiency, energy efficient control of the variable speed pumps becomes an important issue. In today?s business environment, heating and cooling systems are looking for new strategies to enchase plant performance. An easy and often overlooked means to make a dramatic impact on these systems? performances is through maximazing pumping system efficiency. The assesment of technical and economical advantages gained by using variable speed drives instead of throttling valves on circulation pumps, have been widely publicized in recent years. Circulation pumps are responsible for the circulation of hot and cold water in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. Older non controlled circulation pumps can be one of the most energy consuming electric devices in private household and commercial buildings. In this thesis, within the framework of the legislation and regulations, variable speed circulation pumps are investigated for better energy efficiency. The parallel running variable speed circulation pumps in closed loop systems are also investigated for better energy and system efficiency. Especially, this study is based on parallel running variable speed circulation pumps. Parallel running of the circulation pumps is an important issue and it should be investigated carefully for energy efficient working. Under the same hydraulic conditions, for the same type of parallel running variable speed circulation pumps, with the same speed ratio, the best overall energy efficiency is sought. System control algorithm which developed for the circulating pumps is also an important issue for evaluating energy efficiency. Pressure control algorithm is based on two methods such as constant and variable differential control.
