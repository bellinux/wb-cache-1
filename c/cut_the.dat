5|$|In November 2009 Altadhaug Municipality <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> {{budgets of}} youth organisations by an {{estimated}} NOK 400,000. Steinholt opposed this, {{saying that if}} the wages of the mayor and several other high-ranking politicians had been <b>cut,</b> <b>the</b> municipality could have saved NOK 487,000. In the 2009 parliamentary election Steinholt received 1,829 votes, again as Red Nordland's leading candidate.|$|E

5|$|A 19-yard {{punt return}} by Mikey Henderson put Georgia into good field position. Stafford {{capitalized}} on the opportunity, completing a 26-yard pass to put Georgia into field-goal range.

5|$|A second, 35-yard {{field goal}} <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> Kent State lead to 14–13, {{and a pair}} of fourth-quarter touchdowns sealed the victory for Toledo. Touchdowns were scored by Neil Trotter on a 38-yard run and on a three-yard pass from Kevin Meger to Dan Grossman for the 28–14 win. The victory {{improved}} Toledo's all-time record against Kent State to 18–19.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a left invariant Riemannian metric on SO(3) with two equal eigenvalues. We find <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> locus and <b>the</b> equation for <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> time.

Also we prove that <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> locus and <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> time converge to <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> locus and <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> time in <b>the</b> sub-Riemannian problem on SO(3) {{as one of the}} metric eigenvalues tends to infinity.

50|$|Before <b>the</b> tax <b>cuts,</b> <b>the</b> highest {{marginal}} {{income tax rate}} was 39.6 percent. After <b>the</b> <b>cuts,</b> <b>the</b> highest rate was 35 percent. Once <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> were eliminated for high income levels (single people making $400,000+ per year and couples making $450,000+ per year), the top income tax rate returned to 39.6 percent.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the Lie group PSL(2) (the group of orientation preserving isometries of the hyperbolic plane) and a left-invariant Riemannian metric on this group with two equal eigenvalues {{that correspond to}} space-like eigenvectors (with respect to the Killing form). For such metrics we find a parametrization of geodesics, the conjugate time, <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> time and <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> locus. <b>The</b> injectivity radius is computed. We show that <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> time and <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> locus in such Riemannian problem converge to <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> time and <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> locus in <b>the</b> corresponding sub-Riemannian problem as the third eigenvalue of the metric tends to infinity. Similar results are also obtained for SL(2). Comment: 39 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

5|$|After a {{disastrous}} helicopter crash in 1999 {{resulting in the}} deaths of six Marines and one sailor, the US Navy performed an assessment of their equipment and decided among other things that they needed a new search and rescue knife.

5|$|After sacrificing an animal, another {{important}} rite of Hajj is shaving head or trimming hair (known as Halak). All male pilgrims shave their head or trim their {{hair on the}} day of Eid al Adha and women pilgrims <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> tips of their hair.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that this}} cut is {{slightly}} different from <b>the</b> branch <b>cut</b> we've already encountered, because it actually excludes the negative real axis from <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> plane. <b>The</b> branch <b>cut</b> left <b>the</b> real axis connected with <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> plane {{on one side}} (0 ≤ θ), but severed it from <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> plane along <b>the</b> other side (θ < 2π).|$|R

This {{flanking}} effort {{resulted in the}} Battle of Chantilly which {{would prove to be}} the most disastrous engagement of the entire war for the 21st Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Difficult {{economic}} times marked Brown's term in office. During his tenure, the state's unemployment rate climbed from 5.6 percent to 11.7 percent.

When state income fell short of expectations, he reduced the state budget by 22 percent and <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> number of state employees from 37,241 to 30,783, mostly through transfer and attrition. At the same time, his merit pay policies increased salaries for the remaining employees {{by an average of}} 34 percent.
