5|$|Many of Titan's <b>craters</b> or {{probable}} <b>craters</b> display {{evidence of}} extensive erosion, and all show {{some indication of}} modification. Most large <b>craters</b> have breached or incomplete rims, {{despite the fact that}} some <b>craters</b> on Titan have relatively more massive rims than those anywhere else in the Solar System. There is little evidence of formation of palimpsests through viscoelastic crustal relaxation, unlike on other large icy moons. Most <b>craters</b> lack central peaks and have smooth floors, possibly due to impact-generation or later eruption of cryovolcanic lava. Infill from various geological processes is one reason for Titan's relative deficiency of craters; atmospheric shielding also plays a role. It is estimated that Titan's atmosphere reduces the number of <b>craters</b> on its surface by a factor of two.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding Aristarchus {{are several}} smaller <b>craters,</b> {{many of which}} are {{probably}} secondary <b>craters.</b> Secondary <b>craters</b> form when large blocks ejected from the primary crater reimpact the surface at high velocities. By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing a letter {{on the side of the}} crater midpoint that is closest to the primary crater.|$|E
5|$|Ariel {{appears to}} be fairly evenly cratered {{compared}} to other moons of Uranus; the relative paucity of large <b>craters</b> suggests that its surface does not date to the Solar System's formation, which means that Ariel must have been completely resurfaced at some point of its history. Ariel's past geologic activity {{is believed to have}} been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently. The largest crater observed on Ariel, Yangoor, is only 78km across, and shows signs of subsequent deformation. All large <b>craters</b> on Ariel have flat floors and central peaks, and few of the <b>craters</b> are surrounded by bright ejecta deposits. Many <b>craters</b> are polygonal, indicating that their appearance was influenced by the preexisting crustal structure. In the cratered plains there are a few large (about 100km in diameter) light patches that may be degraded impact <b>craters.</b> If this is the case they would be similar to palimpsests on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. It has been suggested that a circular depression 245km in diameter located at 10°S 30°E is a large, highly degraded impact structure.|$|E
5000|$|Longwanqun National Forest Park (...) is {{a nationally}} {{protected}} nature area in Huinan County, Jilin, China. Geographically, {{it is part}} of the western Changbai Mountains. A notable feature of the park are a group of volcanic <b>crater</b> lakes: the Sanjiaolong <b>Crater</b> Lake (三角龙湾, Triangle Dragon <b>Crater</b> Lake), Dalong <b>Crater</b> Lake (大龙湾, Big Dragon <b>Crater</b> Lake), Erlong <b>Crater</b> Lake (Medium Dragon <b>Crater</b> Lake), Xiaolong <b>Crater</b> Lake (Small Dragon <b>Crater</b> Lake), Donglong <b>Crater</b> Lake (East Dragon <b>Crater</b> Lake), Nanlong <b>Crater</b> Lake (South Dragon <b>Crater</b> Lake), Hanlong <b>Crater</b> Lake (Dry Dragon <b>Crater</b> Lake).|$|R
50|$|Black Bottom <b>Crater</b> is a {{volcanic}} <b>crater</b> located in Arizona, east-northeast of Sunset <b>Crater,</b> and west-southwest of Roden <b>Crater.</b> To the northwest is Strawberry <b>Crater.</b> Black Bottom <b>Crater</b> is a cinder cone in the San Francisco volcanic field.|$|R
50|$|The {{depth of}} any <b>crater</b> in a solid planet or moon - {{whether it is}} an impact <b>crater,</b> a {{volcanic}} <b>crater,</b> or a subsidence <b>crater</b> - may be measured from the local surface {{to the bottom of}} the <b>crater,</b> or from the rim of the <b>crater</b> to the bottom.|$|R
5|$|Based {{on their}} {{experience}} with the ancient surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, scientists expected to see numerous impact <b>craters</b> in Voyager 1s first images of Io. The density of impact <b>craters</b> across Io's surface would have given clues to Io's age. However, they were {{surprised to discover that}} the surface was almost completely lacking in impact <b>craters,</b> but was instead covered in smooth plains dotted with tall mountains, pits of various shapes and sizes, and volcanic lava flows. Compared to most worlds observed to that point, Io's surface was covered in a variety of colorful materials (leading Io to be compared to a rotten orange or to pizza) from various sulfurous compounds. The lack of impact <b>craters</b> indicated that Io's surface is geologically young, like the terrestrial surface; volcanic materials continuously bury <b>craters</b> as they are produced. This result was spectacularly confirmed as at least nine active volcanoes were observed by Voyager 1.|$|E
5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' <b>craters</b> are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform <b>craters</b> and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed <b>craters</b> tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as <b>craters</b> only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater {{is a prime example of}} a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E

5000|$|Inner <b>Crater</b> (...) is the {{topographic}} feature that embraces the <b>crater</b> within {{the floor of}} Main <b>Crater,</b> at the summit of Mount Erebus, Ross Island, Antarctica. Inner <b>Crater</b> contains an active anorthoclase-phonolite lava lake. The name {{is derived from the}} fact that the <b>crater</b> is within the Main <b>Crater</b> of Mount Erebus.|$|R
50|$|The <b>crater</b> is 25 km in diameter. The {{floor of}} the <b>crater</b> is 580 metres (1,914 feet) below the plains {{surrounding}} the <b>crater.</b> The <b>crater's</b> rim rises 620 metres (2,046 feet) above the plains and 1,200 metres (3,960 feet) above the <b>crater</b> floor. The <b>crater's</b> central peak is 536 metres (1,769 feet) high. The <b>crater's</b> diameter is 40 times the depth resulting in a relatively shallow appearance.|$|R
5|$|Five {{overlapping}} <b>craters</b> {{are aligned}} in a north-south line on Lastarria's main cone. Volcanic activity has migrated north during {{the history of}} Lastarria, {{and the most recent}} eruption products are found on the northern and western slopes. A lava dome sits on the northernmost crater rim. The South Spur has two <b>craters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Impact crater diameters seen {{range from}} 0.1kma limit {{defined by the}} imaging resolutionto over 100km, not {{counting}} the multi-ring structures. Small <b>craters,</b> with diameters less than 5km, have simple bowl or flat-floored shapes. Those 540km across usually have a central peak. Larger impact features, with diameters in the range 25100km, have central pits instead of peaks, such as Tindr crater. The largest <b>craters</b> with diameters over 60km can have central domes, which are thought to result from central tectonic uplift after an impact; examples include Doh and Hár <b>craters.</b> A small number of very largemore 100km in diameterand bright impact <b>craters</b> show anomalous dome geometry. These are unusually shallow and may be a transitional landform to the multi-ring structures, as with the Lofn impact feature. Callisto's <b>craters</b> are generally shallower than those on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Impact glass, {{formed by}} the impact of meteors, which on Earth can {{preserve}} signs of life, has been found {{on the surface of}} the impact <b>craters</b> on Mars. Likewise, the glass in impact <b>craters</b> on Mars could have preserved signs of life if life existed at the site.|$|E

5|$|Mathilde is very dark, with an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh asphalt, and {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid {{has a number of}} extremely large <b>craters,</b> with the individual <b>craters</b> being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest <b>craters,</b> Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the <b>craters.</b> No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the <b>craters</b> and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{recognized}} {{two classes of}} geological feature on Oberon: <b>craters</b> and chasmata ('canyons'—deep, elongated, steep-sided depressions which would probably be described as rift valleys or escarpments if on Earth). Oberon's surface is the most heavily cratered of all the Uranian moons, with a crater density approaching saturation—when the formation of new <b>craters</b> is balanced by destruction of old ones. This high number of <b>craters</b> indicates that Oberon has the most ancient surface among Uranus's moons. The crater diameters range up to 206 kilometers for the largest known crater, Hamlet. Many large <b>craters</b> are surrounded by bright impact ejecta (rays) consisting of relatively fresh ice. The largest <b>craters,</b> Hamlet, Othello and Macbeth, have floors made of a very dark material deposited after their formation. A peak with a height of about 11km was observed in some Voyager images near the south-eastern limb of Oberon, {{which may be the}} central peak of a large impact basin with a diameter of about 375km. Oberon's surface is intersected by a system of canyons, which, however, are less widespread than those found on Titania. The canyons' sides are probably scarps produced by normal faults which can be either old or fresh: the latter transect the bright deposits of some large <b>craters,</b> indicating that they formed later. The most prominent Oberonian canyon is Mommur Chasma.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{have so far}} {{recognized}} {{only one}} class of geological feature on Umbriel—craters. The surface of Umbriel has far more and larger <b>craters</b> than do Ariel and Titania. It shows the least geological activity. In fact, among the Uranian moons only Oberon has more impact <b>craters</b> than Umbriel. The observed crater diameters range from a few kilometers {{at the low end}} to 210kilometers for the largest known crater, Wokolo. All recognized <b>craters</b> on Umbriel have central peaks, but no crater has rays.|$|E
5000|$|Twin <b>Crater</b> (...) is a <b>crater</b> {{with twin}} nested cones that rises behind McMurdo Station and 0.5 {{nautical}} miles (0.9 km) west of <b>Crater</b> Hill on Hut Point Peninsula, Ross Island. This <b>crater</b> was named Middle <b>Crater</b> by Frank Debenham of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910-13, apparently for its location {{in relation to}} First <b>Crater</b> and <b>Crater</b> Hill, but the name has fallen into disuse. Twin <b>Crater,</b> alluding to the nested cones in the <b>crater,</b> was applied as early as 1971 and the name has become established because of consistent use in current maps and reports. Black Knob, a big black rock outcrop lies 0.2 nautical miles (0.4 km) east of Twin <b>Crater.</b>|$|R

50|$|Gruemberger {{is an old}} impact <b>crater</b> in the {{southern}} part of the Moon. When viewed from the Earth this <b>crater</b> appears oval in shape due to foreshortening, but it is actually relatively circular. The <b>crater</b> lies about 25 kilometers to the north-northwest of the larger and more prominent <b>crater</b> Moretus. The smaller <b>crater</b> Cysatus intrudes into the eastern rim of Gruemberger. About one and a half <b>crater</b> diameters to the north is the large <b>crater</b> Clavius.|$|R
25|$|Within the Borealis region, three {{widespread}} plains {{units are}} recognized largely by their obvious differences in <b>crater</b> density, which {{is closely related}} to relative age (Soderblom and Boyce, 1972). From most heavily <b>cratered</b> (oldest) to least <b>cratered</b> (youngest), these units are intercrater plains material, intermediate plains material, and smooth plains material. Visual identification is confirmed and refined by actual <b>crater</b> counts. If one uses the lunar surface as a frame of reference, the <b>crater</b> density of Mercurian plains in the Borealis region is bracketed by that of the lunar uplands, the most heavily <b>cratered</b> lunar surface, and that of Oceanus Procellarum, a moderately <b>cratered</b> lunar mare surface. The curve for the lunar uplands was derived from <b>crater</b> counts in the region northwest of <b>crater</b> Tsiolkovskiy, between <b>crater</b> Mendeleev and Mare Smithii. The curve for the southeastern part of Oceanus Procellarum was obtained in an area centered near lat 2°00' N. and long 31°00'W., south of the <b>crater</b> Kunowsky. Ocean Procellarum has long been considered close to the “average lunar mare” (Hartmann, 1966, 1967); its <b>crater</b> density is intermediate between those of the heavily <b>cratered</b> Mare Tranquillitatis and the lightly <b>cratered</b> Mare Serenitatis.|$|R

5|$|Voyager 1s first {{images of}} Io {{revealed}} {{a lack of}} impact <b>craters,</b> suggesting a very young surface. <b>Craters</b> are used by geologists to estimate the age of a planetary surface; the number of impact structures increase with {{the age of the}} planetary surface. Instead, Voyager 1 observed a multi-coloured surface, pockmarked with irregular-shaped depressions, which lacked the raised rims characteristic of impact <b>craters.</b> Voyager 1 also observed flow features formed by low-viscosity fluid and tall, isolated mountains that did not resemble terrestrial volcanoes. The surface observed suggested that, just as Peale and colleagues had theorized, Io was heavily modified by volcanism.|$|E
5|$|Almost a {{thousand}} impact <b>craters</b> on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, <b>craters</b> show {{a range of}} states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the <b>craters</b> are in pristine condition. The number of <b>craters,</b> together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300–600 million years ago, followed by a decay in volcanism. Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus {{is thought to be}} unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.|$|E
