Swindon: ESRCThe family courts face intense {{criticism}} about decisions made about child contact (or access) following parental separation or divorce. Both father's rights groups and Women's Aid have {{raised concerns about}} institutional bias, ineffectiveness {{and a lack of}} transparency. However, the inherently closed nature of decision-making in the family courts has prevented greater understanding of how decisions are reached. This study addresses this gap by undertaking a detailed analysis of in-court <b>conciliation</b> <b>meetings</b> where parents negotiate over contact with the assistance of a judge or court social worker. The research uses conversation analysis to explore precisely how the actual, real-time work of family courts is undertaken in and through the communicative processes of spoken interaction. The study will explore, for example, the interactional processes by which agreements are achieved, negotiated and/or impeded, and how the rights and needs of children and parents are discursively framed by conciliators and disputants.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} two {{design patterns}} enabling to extend automatically a virtual prototyping application into a collaborative application. The proposed patterns deal with distributed designation and automatic aggregation. They provide adequate properties {{in term of}} cooperation and mobility while guarantying good usability over the standard Internet. Thus, distant participants can share and cooperate to define common agreed design of a virtual prototype while alternating between disconnected and meeting works. These two patterns take {{part of a more}} complete framework including several other patterns that address distributed protection, meeting schedule, real time membership, real time awareness, progression, parallel work, refreshment, security, address allocation and multicast connectivity. First pattern provides a distributed designation of a virtual scene tree that supports mobility. Unique names are maintained in a fully distributed way among disconnected workspaces and meeting replicas. Second pattern addresses the aggregation of different disconnected workspaces into a global scene tree. That aggregation mechanism relies on a peer-to-peer communication model. It enables to aggregate the scene while working on it. Different patterns of our framework rely on existing patterns that we compound. They capture an efficient style of distribution through reuse of existing architectural patterns. The whole framework runs on Unix and Windows, can be deployed easily on the standard Internet, is fully distributed and supports efficiently mobility and <b>conciliation</b> <b>meetings.</b> It is used in a virtual prototyping application at EADS...|$|R
40|$|Background. The growing {{population}} {{of people with}} acquired brain injury (ABI) requires a strong focus on clients to {{be integrated into the}} community in order to use their productive skills in society, to help them live with greater independence, and to reduce community expenditure. To date, there is limited theoretical and conceptual development of frameworks documenting the factors influencing community integration as it applies to adults with acquired brain injury. Furthermore, although there is considerable attention paid to community integration as a desired outcome, there exists no evidence-based framework explaining characteristic of successful community interventions for people with acquired brain injury. In addition, fidelity of ABI interventions is not considered in the literature against an evidence-based framework. Objectives. This study was completed in three phases aiming (1) to develop a framework for community integration for adults with post acute ABI; (2) to investigate characteristics of successful community integration programmes in order to develop an instrument to evaluate fidelity of community integration program for adults with ABI; and (3) to field test the instrument to (a) identify implementation issues; (b) explore the relationship between the themes and attributes across the three services; and (c) establish some aspects of the psychometric properties of the instrument. Methodology and Results. The first phase of the study aimed to obtain a framework to define community integration for adults with ABI. The Participant Groups included six researchers, seven health professionals, six policy makers, eight people with ABI and ten family members. Following a pilot study which examined understandability of the documentation and terms used in the study, the Policy Delphi survey method (Hasson, Keeney, & McKenna, 2000; Turoff, 2002; 1995) was applied which included three steps. Each step of the study began with a survey or a semi-structured interview. The data were analysed and the results were used in the next step. At {{the end of the first}} phase of the study, a framework to identify community integration for adults with ABI was developed. A broad literature review confirmed its themes. The community integration framework (CIF) included seven community integration themes and descriptors. The themes consisted of Relationships, Acceptance, Community access, Occupation, Being at home, Picking up life again, and Heightened risks and vulnerability. In the second phase of the study, a multi attribute utility (MAU) technique was applied (Camasso & Dick, 1993; Huber, 1974; Lewis, Johnson, & Scholl, 2003). The CIF which resulted from the first phase was used in this phase as a basis to identify the characteristics of programmes that contributed to the achievement of community integration for adults with ABI. This part of the study was completed using four stages. In each stage, surveys or semi-structured interviews were used to gather the participants‘ opinions on the characteristics of a successful community integration programme. Analysis of the results of each stage informed the next stage. In the first stage of the second phase the data (descriptors of community integration programmes) were categorised into seven clusters and 26 sub-clusters. In the second stage, the Participant Groups reviewed and examined the importance of the programme characteristics using a Likert Scale. This stage resulted in determining the priority weights of the items. In the third stage, an Expert Panel reviewed the results during a day-long working group. The Expert Panel including 10 people as a sub-group of the participant groups modified the themes, their descriptors and attributes, and then identified indicators for the attributes as the programme characteristics for community integration for people with ABI. The themes, their descriptors and attributes were compared with ABI outcome measures currently available in the literature. During the fourth stage, the themes and attributes were sent to the Participant Groups and the Expert panel to finally confirm and determine the relative importance of each theme and attribute. This was the final stage in the development of the programme assessment of community integration attributes (PACIA) which included seven themes and 21 attributes. The themes consisted of Person centred approaches and planning, Relationships, Working together, Development of skills, Community based practices, Support for service users, and Service setting and atmosphere. Each attribute was further defined with indicators. Sources of evidence were identified to enable attributes to be rated. The third phase of the study included a field study of PACIA, an examination of possible implementation issues with the tool, and an evaluation of some specific psychometric properties of PACIA. The field study aimed to examine the effectiveness of the evaluation process, and investigate the relationship between the themes and attributes across the three services. A trained evaluation team first individually rated each service by PACIA through observation, reading the documents, and interviews with the staff, service users, and families. A <b>conciliation</b> <b>meeting</b> followed to achieve consensus on the service ratings. The three services achieved a range of scores on the PACIA themes and attributes based on their different qualities. This phase also explored the ease of use and issues in the implementation of the instrument based on the raters‘ feedback, and examined inter-rater reliability, face validity, and content validity of PACIA. Within the limitations of the field test method, the study indicated that PACIA is a valid and reliable instrument to evaluate community integration programmes. Conclusion. Integration or re-integration into the community is a vital social objective for people with ABI for whom intensive medical rehabilitation may be followed by an uncertain pathway of longer-term rehabilitation. This study developed an evidencebased community integration framework (CIF) to describe community integration for adults with ABI. The research method surveyed a wide group of key stakeholders whose views formed the basis of the framework. The framework may be useful as a basis for making policy decisions to enhance community inclusion. The CIF provides an agreed description of a theory or model upon which the characteristics of programmes aimed to facilitate community integration were identified and the fidelity of those programmes were assessed. The other result of this study was the development of a fidelity instrument named as Programme Assessment of Community Integration Attributes (PACIA). While there are obviously additional characteristics of PACIA that remain to be researched, this evidence-based instrument appears to be valid and reliable to test the fidelity of community integration programmes. Community integration programmes can be evaluated more comprehensively by PACIA than has been the position in the past. Such an evaluation instrument may help existing programmes re-focus to provide more efficient services for people with ABI...|$|E

Parrott remained a member of the miners’ side of the conciliation board until the time of his death. Despite the work of the board, by 1896, Parrott was warning that miners had given their representatives authority to arrange strikes if the latest round of wage increases were not met and if mines were closed and men thrown out of work. He addressed a meeting of miners saying that Yorkshire was fully prepared to meet the emergency, that the men were well-organised and had both the funds and courage necessary. They were as determined as ever to fight for the maintenance and principle of the living wage.|$|R

She soon agreed to resume her role as a paid organiser for he WSPU and was sent to Newport in south-east Wales to continue her duties.

5000|$|The Young Irelanders {{eventually}} seceded {{from the}} Repeal Association. The {{leader of the}} Repeal Association, Daniel O'Connell, opposed the use of physical force to enact repeal, and passed 'peace resolutions' declaring that violence and force {{were not to be}} employed. Though the Young Irelanders did not support the use of violence, the writers of The Nation maintained that the introduction of these peace resolutions was poorly timed, and that to declare outright that physical force would never be used was 'to deliver themselves bound hand and foot to the Whigs.' William Smith O'Brien, who had previously worked to achieve compromise between O'Connell and The Nation group, was also concerned, and claimed that he feared these resolutions were an attempt to exclude the Young Irelanders from the Association altogether. At an Association meeting held in July 1846 at <b>Conciliation</b> Hall, the <b>meeting</b> place of the Association, Thomas Francis Meagher, a Young Irelander, addressing the peace resolutions, delivered his 'Sword Speech', in which he stated, [...] "I do not abhor the use of arms in the vindication of national rights ... Be it for the defence, or be it for the assertion of a nation's liberty, I look upon the sword as a sacred weapon." [...] John O'Connell, Daniel O'Connell's son, was present at the proceedings and interrupted Meagher's speech, claiming that Meagher could no longer be part of the same association as O'Connell and his supporters. After some protest, the Young Irelanders left Conciliation Hall and the Repeal Association forever, founding the Irish Confederation 13 January 1847 after negotiations for a reunion had failed.|$|R
