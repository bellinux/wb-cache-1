40|$|Most {{providers}} {{have experienced}} increased documentation demands {{with the use}} of electronic health records (EHRs). We sought to identify efficiency strategies that providers use to complete clinical documentation tasks in ambulatory care. Two observers performed ethnographic observations and interviews with 22 ambulatory care providers in a U. S. Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Observation notes and interview transcripts were coded for recurrent strategies relating to <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> the EHR <b>progress</b> notes. Findings included: the use of paper artifacts for handwritten notations; electronic templates for automation of certain parts of the note; use of shorthand and phrases rather than narrative writing; copying and pasting from previous EHR notes; directly entering information into the EHR note during the patient encounter; reliance on memory; and pre-populating an EHR note prior to seeing the patient. We discuss the findings in the context of distributed cognition to understand how clinical information is propagated and represented toward <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> a <b>progress</b> note. The study findings have important implications for improving and streamlining clinical documentation related to human factors workload management strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{expansion}} of the American community college has not been matched by the rapid, or even consistent, <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> all entering students toward postsecondary credentials. Instead, {{a significant proportion of}} students enrolled in community colleges appear "stuck" on the road to <b>completion.</b> This lack <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> is due to the complex ways in which social and educational inequalities affect specific students and the institutions of higher education designated to serve them. As a result, policymakers and practitioners face significant challenges in their efforts to promote academic momentum. In {{the first part of this}} literature review, the sources of these challenges are located in student characteristics as well as in state and institutional practices and policies. It is argued that there exists an interaction of sorts between the actions of community colleges and the attributes of their students. Acknowledging the myriad complexities in efforts to improve the <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> all two-year students toward goal or degree completion, the second part of this paper examines empirical research to identify opportunities for improvement...|$|R

This THWRA-required progress report provides information about ETTP's hazardous waste streams regulated under THWRA and waste reduction progress made in calendar year (CY) 1999. This progress report also documents the annual review of the site plan, ''Oak Ridge Operations Environmental Management and Enrichment Facilities (EMEF) Pollution Prevention Program Plan'', BJC/OR- 306 /R 1 (Bechtel Jacobs Company 199 a). In 1996, ETTP established new goal year ratios that extended the goal year to CY 1999 and targeted 50 percent waste stream-specific reduction goals. In CY 1999, these CY 1999 goals were extended to CY 2000 for all waste streams that generated waste in 1999.

40|$|Thrombophlebitis and {{pulmonary}} embolism are major causes of disability {{and death in}} both medical and surgical patients. Etiological factors are still poorly understood. Preventive measures as currently practised are non-specific and based on questionable premises. Diagnostic measures to predict the silent fatal embolus are inadequate. Currently accepted treatment measures are designed to prevent extension of the thrombus but {{have no effect on}} the existing clot. Theoretically, thrombolytic preparations now being marketed offer some hope for dissolution of preformed thrombi. An experimental study was carried out on artificially induced thrombi in jugular and femoral veins of mongrel dogs. Human fibrinolysin (Actase, Ortho) was infused locally and systemically in varying doses. No thrombi were successfully lyzed by either method. Thirty-six cases of acute deep thrombophlebitis in the leg, one of axillary thrombosis, three of chronic postphlebitis of a lower limb with massive edema and eight of pulmonary emboli were observed and carefully documented clinically. All these patients received anticoagulants unless there was a contraindication. Fibrinolysin infusions in varying dosages were administered to 27 patients; 10 served as controls. The observers were unaware of the identity of those receiving the actual drug or of those given the placebo until <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> the study. <b>Progress</b> <b>of</b> the disease was judged by the rate of dis-appearance of symptoms and signs.
