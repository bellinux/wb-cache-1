50|$|Portugal, long a <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>emigration,</b> has {{now become}} a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Portuguese {{overseas}} territories in India (until 1961), Africa (until 1975), and Far East Asia (until 1999). Since the 1990s, along with a boom in construction, several new waves of Ukrainian, Brazilian, people from the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and other Africans have settled in the country. Those communities currently make up the largest groups of immigrants in Portugal. Romanians, Moldovans and Chinese also have chosen Portugal as a destination.

50|$|Portugal's colonial {{history has}} long since been a {{cornerstone}} of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean.

Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and personal reasons. Portugal, long a <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>emigration</b> (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975.|$|E

For this, links need to be discovered which exist between European languages and languages of origin. Firstly, all languages are not important. A social hierarchy exists which depends on the context of elocution. Multilingualism was gradually developed during the 20 th century but all bilingualisms are not considered as a resource. Bilingualism related to immigration is often synonymous with handicap and deficit of integration which justifies a certain essentialisation of the language. However, language learning depends partly on its social value in the host country and the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin. This social recognition rests for example on the fact that it concerns an oral or written language; a religious language, an international language, etc. This article thus aims at understanding the European and national language policies set up to support the mobility of individuals and their entry into new territories.

40|$|Located at the {{geographical}} intersection between East and West, with both Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts, Turkey {{was always a}} country with large movements of people.

In the post-Second world war period, Turkey became a <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>emigration.</b> In 1961 a bilateral agreement on labor recruitment between Turkey and Germany had been signed. In the following years, similar bilateral agreements were reached with a couple of other European countries (Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherland and Sweden). Nowadays, things have changed. Turkey is still a <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>emigration.</b> But it has also become a country of immigration and transit. And therefore, it faces similar challenges of migration and integration that are characteristic for areas with strong cross-cultural movements of people.

The research determined the basic demographic characteristics of foreign workers, their geographical origin, reasons for their immigration, main trends in social exclusion and discrimination, as well as the sustainability of their immigration.
