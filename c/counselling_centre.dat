[...] All are bleak, and remain so, but the work that goes on in these buildings is various and dedicated: [...] St Joseph's retreat house, the Tallaght parish, St Catherine's <b>counselling</b> <b>centre,</b> at least two publishing enterprises, individual writing and international research in several domains. Most recently Tallaght Priory has seen the birth of an institute for distance learning, started in 2000 but adapting well to new challenges and the possibility of outreach to a generation awake to the possibilities offered by the internet. This is validated through the Institute for Technology, Tallaght, the priory's closest neighbours.|$|E

40|$|<b>Counselling</b> <b>centres</b> are {{facilities}} that provide services especially to problematic drug users. To achieve {{the highest possible}} effectiveness {{it is necessary to}} include also social surroundings (parents, partners or school) of the problematic drug user into the overall treatment. The fundamental prerequisite of existence of these centres is their accessibility without booking in advance and without waiting times for everyone who needs to deal with his or her emergency situation immediately. That is why these centres are called mentally and socially barrier-free, so called low-threshold facilities. I have chosen the qualitative method to conduct the research. As a technique for data gathering I selected secondary data analysis and semi-structured interviews with drug users who visit <b>counselling</b> <b>centres.</b> For the research I used data from annual reports from <b>counselling</b> <b>centres</b> in Písek and České Budějovice.

Since {{the validity of the}} new Shool Act No. 561 / 2004 coll. in 2005, the child at the age of six in the current school year must enter the compulsory school attendance unless suspension is permitted. The child at the age of six within the period of the beginning {{of the school}} year and the end of the calendar year may be adopted for the compulsory school attendance under certain circumstances even in this school year. There are lots of discussions performed by society, professionals or politicians about the earlier or later initiation of the school attendance. Since 90 th in the last century the number of the suspensions of the school attendance has increased. Parents ask for suspension more often than in the past and the suspension is proposed and realized at one fifth of the children in the current school year. This means that the demands on children at the beginning of the shcool year are increasing and that parents have realized their responsibility for the success of their child. The beginning of the school attendance is a very important moment in the life of their child and no rush is necessary. In my thesis I investigated diagnostics of the school maturity used in the Czech Republic, mainly in the pedagogical-psychological <b>counselling</b> <b>centres,</b> posibilities of non mature functions development, leaflets and advices for parents and programmes used in the <b>counselling</b> <b>centres.</b> In my thesis I dealt with general problems of the pre-school child development and the assessment of the school maturity non-professional and professional in the pedagogical-psychological <b>counselling</b> <b>centres.</b> I summarized basic abbilities from each area which should be adopted by the child before {{the beginning of the school}} attendance, what should parents notice and also testing methods and materials used for the examination at the pedagogical-psychological <b>counselling</b> <b>centres.</b> In my research part I focused on the families with pre-school children asking for suspension of school attendance...|$|R
