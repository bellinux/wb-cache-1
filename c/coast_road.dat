A caravan park, Manor House Park, is situated across the Moss to the southeast, to the southwest of the hamlet of Edderside.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, {{the state}} {{government}} has been committed to constructing and upgrading the Perth Bunbury Highway, a route along coastal roads, including Old <b>Coast</b> <b>Road</b> south of Mandurah. The ultimate design is for a freeway or expressway-standard road, but with staged construction initially providing a dual carriageway.|$|E

5|$|The SSSI is a long, {{narrow strip}} of coast that starts at the eastern {{boundary}} of The Wash between Old Hunstanton and Holme-next-the-Sea, and runs east for about 43km (27mi) to Kelling. The southern boundary runs roughly west to east except where it detours around towns and villages, and never crosses the A149 <b>coast</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{to the north of}} the A149 <b>coast</b> <b>road</b> just east of the village of Cley next the Sea, 6km (3.7mi) north of Holt.

It then set off towards Mersa Matruh on the <b>coast</b> <b>road</b> and the escarpment, {{in contact with the}} 9th Armoured Brigade. The regiment halted at Gambut on 13 November, moving east to Menastir six days later.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 2014, the Geographic Names Committee {{decide to}} rename the roads that connect Forrest Highway to Bunbury – part of Old <b>Coast</b> <b>Road</b> {{as well as}} Australind Bypass – {{as part of the}} highway. The {{renaming}} had been proposed in 2013 due to public confusion over the three names used for the route to Bunbury: Forrest Highway to Lake Clifton, Old <b>Coast</b> <b>Road</b> from there to north of Australind, and then Australind Bypass. Emergency services had difficulty locating incidents due to the confusion. The renaming followed similar changes to Main Roads' internal-use designations in May 2011, which deprecated Perth Bunbury Highway (Highway H2) in favour of Melville Mandurah Highway (Highway H2) for the portion north of Mandurah, Lakeland Lake Clifton Road (Main Road M74) for the Mandurah to Lake Clifton section together with Mandjoogoordap Drive, and an extension of Forrest Highway (Highway H57) for the Lake Clifton to Bunbury portion. Changes to the road signs were expected to be completed by mid-July. The renaming was considered unusual, as it affected a significant length of a major road, which was the address of eleven residential properties.|$|E

5|$|While Old <b>Coast</b> <b>Road's</b> dual {{carriageway}} was advancing north from Bunbury, and Kwinana Freeway was progressively being extended south from Perth, the alignment through Mandurah was constrained by existing development. Keeping the existing alignment {{would result in}} a traffic bottleneck through Mandurah. To overcome this problem, Main Roads began planning for a new route east of the Peel Inlet in the 1980s.|$|R

5|$|One {{year after}} Forrest Highway opened, {{the number of}} road {{accidents}} on the main roads in the area had decreased by 60%. Traffic on South Western Highway had reduced by 50% north of Pinjarra, and by 20% to the south, {{and there was an}} 82% reduction along Old <b>Coast</b> <b>Road</b> within a month of the new highway opening. However, tourism in towns along the former routes was affected by the reduced traffic flow, with businesses losing as much as 60% of their trade.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} written by Michael Arndt and was {{originally}} about an East <b>Coast</b> <b>road</b> trip from Maryland to Florida, but was shifted to a journey from New Mexico to California because of budget issues. Arndt started the script on May 23, 2000 and completed the first rough draft by May 26. He had initially planned on shooting the film himself by raising several thousand dollars and using a camcorder. Instead, he gave the screenplay to producers Ron Yerxa and Albert Berger who teamed up with Deep River Productions to find a potential director.|$|E
5|$|Communications within Wales are {{influenced}} by the topography and the mountainous nature of the country: the main rail and road routes between South and North Wales loop to the east and pass largely through England. The only motorway in Wales is the M4 motorway from London to South Wales, entering the country over the Second Severn Crossing, passing close to Newport, Cardiff and Swansea and extending as far west as the Pont Abraham services before continuing northwest as the A48 to Carmarthen. The A40 is a major trunk road connecting London to Fishguard via Brecon and Carmarthen. The A487 <b>coast</b> <b>road</b> links Cardigan with Aberystwyth, and the A44 links Aberystwyth with Rhayader, Leominster and Worcester. The main trunk road in North Wales is the A55 dual carriageway road from Chester past St Asaph and Abergele, continuing along the coast to Bangor, crossing Anglesey and terminating at Holyhead.|$|E

5|$|Mandurah {{had grown}} rapidly {{as a tourist}} {{destination}} in the post war period, and on 17 April 1953 a new bridge connecting Old <b>Coast</b> <b>Road</b> to Mandurah was opened. Construction of the new bridge, adjacent to the old bridge, began in September 1951, and was designed with reinforced concrete piles. The old wooden bridge had rapidly deteriorated due {{to the presence of}} marine organisms, and needed considerable attention to maintain it in a usable condition. The opening ceremony was attended by the Chairman of the Mandurah Road Board, W. Anderson, Leader of the Opposition, Ross McLarty, Minister for Works, John Tonkin; Commissioner of Main Roads, Digby Leach; C. H. Henning, MLC; engineer in charges of bridges, Ernest Godfrey; local government representatives, and a number of schoolchildren who were given a half-day off school.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{over control}} of the {{northern}} sector from the 7th Brigade, which was subsequently transferred to the southern sector {{to take part in the}} main offensive, the 11th Brigade advanced along the coast from Kuraio Mission, sending out patrols into the interior to flush the Japanese out of their positions in the mountains as they went. The 31st/51st Infantry Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Kelly and roughly 800-strong, formed the vanguard of the advance, its main body moving along the <b>coast</b> <b>road</b> towards Amun, Sipaai and Rukussia, while patrols were sent inland from Totokei towards Lalum and Soraken, both of which were considered key Japanese positions. By 16 January 1945, the lead company of the 31st/51st reached Rukussia, having encountered no Japanese up until that point.|$|E
5|$|The 7thDivision, {{reinforced}} by the 6thDivision's 17thBrigade, formed {{a key part of}} the Allied ground forces during the Syria–Lebanon campaign which was fought against Vichy French forces in June and July1941. With close air support from the RAAF and the Royal Air Force, the Australian force entered Lebanon on 8June and advanced along the <b>coast</b> <b>road</b> and Litani River valley. Although little resistance had been expected, the Vichy forces mounted a strong defence which made good use of the mountainous terrain. After the Allied attack became bogged down reinforcements were brought in and the Australian ICorps headquarters took command of the operation on 18June. These changes enabled the Allies to overwhelm the French forces and the 7thDivision entered Beirut on 12July. The loss of Beirut and a British breakthrough in Syria led the Vichy commander to seek an armistice and the campaign ended on 13July.|$|E

5|$|The North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is {{an internationally}} {{important}} protected area in Norfolk, England. The SSSI is a long, {{narrow strip of}} coastal land that starts between Old Hunstanton and Holme-next-the-Sea, and runs east for about 43km (27mi) to Kelling. The southern boundary runs roughly west to east except where it detours around towns and villages, and never crosses the A149 <b>coast</b> <b>road.</b> It has an area of 7,700ha (19,027acres), and is additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar listings; it {{is also part of}} the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Scolt Head Island and the coast from the Holkham National Nature Reserve to Salthouse are a Biosphere Reserve.|$|E
5|$|The actual road {{names were}} not known until early 2009, when Transport Minister Simon O'Brien {{revealed}} that the section south of Pinjarra Road would be known as Forrest Highway, with the section to the north {{to become part of}} the Kwinana Freeway. The route bypasses Mandurah by taking traffic around the eastern side of the Peel-Harvey Estuary prior to joining the existing dual carriageway on Old <b>Coast</b> <b>Road,</b> reducing the journey time from Perth to Bunbury. The Kwinana Freeway extension and Forrest Highway were opened on 20 September 2009, with a ceremony held at the interchange between the freeway, highway, and Pinjarra Road. The roads were officially opened by Premier Colin Barnett, Senator Chris Evans, Transport Minister Simon O'Brien, Member for Canning Don Randall, and the previous Transport Minister Alannah MacTiernan.|$|E
5|$|After the Allied {{invasion}} of Italy in early September, the Eighth Army advanced rapidly. By {{the middle of}} October the army {{was on the line}} of Termoli, Campobasso and Vinchiaturo. German resistance had stiffened in the last stages of the advance. The Fifth Army captured Naples on 1 October and then crossed the Volturno against strong German resistance. By this point the Allies had run up against the fortifications of the Winter Line. The 15th Army Group commander Harold Alexander revised the plan for the winter, which involved the capture of the high ground north of Pescara after crossing the Trigno, Sangro and Pescara rivers. The Fifth Army would advance up the Liri Valley and when both armies were close to Rome, an amphibious operation would be launched south of the Tiber. To prepare for the offensive, the Allies advanced through the outlying Winter Line defences. The Eighth Army crossed the Trigno in late October and Montgomery planned to advance along the <b>coast</b> <b>road</b> to Pescara, which was the most defended route. Montgomery considered his four infantry divisions too weak to break the line without reinforcement.|$|E
