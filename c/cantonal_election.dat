5000|$|In 1814 Valais {{threw off}} French supremacy, when the Allies entered the territory; in 1815 it joined Switzerland {{as one of}} the cantons. As partial {{compensation}} for the loss of his secular power, the bishop received a post of honour in the Diet of the canton and the right to four votes. Disputes often arose as the Constitution of 1815 of the canton gave Upper Valais political predominance in the cantonal government, notwithstanding the fact that its population was smaller than that of Lower Valais. This led in 1840 to a civil war with Lower Valais, where the [...] "Young Swiss" [...] party, hostile to the Church, were in control. The party friendly to the Church conquered, it is true, and the influence of the Church over teaching was, at first, preserved, but on account of the defeat of the Sonderbund, with which Valais had united, a radical Government gained control in 1847. The new administration at once showed itself unfriendly to the Church, secularized many church landed properties, and wrung large sums of money from the bishop and monasteries. When in 1856 the moderate party gained the <b>cantonal</b> <b>election,</b> negotiations were begun with Bishop Peter Joseph von Preux (1843-1875), and friendly relations were restored between the diocese and the canton. In 1880 the two powers came to an agreement as to the lands taken from the Church in 1848; these, so far as they had not been sold, were given back for their original uses.|$|E
40|$|In several cantons in Switzerland the {{regional}} government, i. e. {{a set of}} governors who share the executive power in the canton, is elected according to an original voting rule, in which voters can vote for several candidates (up to a maximal number of votes). Up to some details, these elections are instances {{of what is known}} in Social Choice Theory as “Committee Approval Voting”. The paper makes use of data from a panel survey collected during the 2011 Zurich <b>cantonal</b> <b>election</b> to check whether a strategic voting theory is consistent with individual behaviour observed during that election. We show that roughly 70 % of the individual decisions on candidates are consistent with our model of rational voting...|$|E
