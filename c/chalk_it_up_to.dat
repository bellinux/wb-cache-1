5|$|In {{the fall}} of 2009, Tonight Show host Conan O'Brien engaged in a satirical on-air and YouTube feud with Booker, with O'Brien jokingly {{insulting}} the City of Newark and Booker responding that he would ban O'Brien from the Newark airport.

Booker then appeared on O'Brien's show and assured viewers that the feud was over and that he was actually a big fan of O'Brien, who agreed that every time he made a joke about Newark, he would donate $500 to the City of Newark, and also made a $50,000 donation to the Newark Now charity, which was matched by NBC Universal.|$|E

5000|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today {{gave the}} episode mixed reviews, saying [...] "perhaps {{it is best}} to think of Thursday's {{broadcast}} as a labor of love, and to presume it worked best for those who are most devoted to the show and its often heady blend of musical flash, after-school-special preachiness and high-and-low humor. It could not have surprised anyone that the episode whipsawed between clashing tones: A scene with Sue spewing out no-one-would-ever-say-that insults crashing up against a that's-how-it-must-feel monologue from Finn's mother about the loss of her child. And if people behaved even more irrationally than usual (would an adult really steal a dead teenager's letter jacket), you can <b>chalk</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> their not being in their right minds." [...] He then concluded [...] "It's almost impossible to do a story about the death of a teenager that doesn't induce tears, particularly when the plot is tied into the real-life loss of a well-liked young actor. One just wishes the writers had put a bit more trust into that natural response, and not tugged at our heartstrings quite so strenuously."Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times also commented on the absence of an explanation for Finn's death, saying [...] "teens and young adults often die for highly preventable reasons much like Monteith did, and while a drug overdose would have been too on the nose, any of numerous other explanations — from drunk driving to other risky behaviors — would have made this not just a somber sendoff, but a teachable moment to the younger quadrant of the program’s audience." ...|$|E

While she resisted Soprano's constant advances, which have simultaneously attracted and appalled her, Soprano no longer wishes for their relationship to remain strictly professional, for he seems to see her as the one thing that he is unable to truly have and, while continuing to pursue her, also resents her for it.|$|R

40|$|Rejection hurts, {{especially}} in childhood. Consider, for example, {{a young boy}} chosen last for a team in gym class. As he sheep-ishly joins his teammates, how does he explain this rejection? While one child might attribute his rejection to athletic inad-equacy, a second might <b>chalk</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> others noticing his fatigue, a third might not think twice about the episode, and another might attribute the rejection to racial discrimination. Each child’s pattern of attributions depends on {{an infinite number of}} variables—what one child perceives as a harmless oversight could be another’s painful experience of racism. In this article, we explore how children learn about outgroups, specifically, outgroup rejection, both through their own expe-riences and through what they learn from others. We report on two studies designed to examine how children are influenced by a negative experience with or a negative piece of informa-tion about a novel outgroup. We are primarily interested in how children learn about single instances of rejection because these isolated experiences are building blocks in the process of how children learn and develop expectations about stigmatization. Developing Stereotypes and Prejudice Learning about how interactions with and rejection by out-group members might affect you (i. e., the target’s perspective) is a complex and relatively understudied process.
