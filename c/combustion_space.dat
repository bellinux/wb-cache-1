40|$|A typical {{glass furnace}} {{consists}} of a <b>combustion</b> <b>space</b> and a melter. Intense heat is generated from the combustion of fuel and air/oxygen in the <b>combustion</b> <b>space.</b> This heat is transferred mainly by radiation to the melter in order to melt sand and cullet (scrap glass) eventually creating glass products. Many furnaces use electric boosters to enhance glass melting and increase productivity. The coupled electric/combustion heat transfer patterns are key to the glass making processes. The understanding of the processes {{can lead to the}} improvement of glass quality and furnace efficiency. The effects of electrical boosting on the flow patterns and heat transfer in a glass melter are investigated using a multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code with addition of an electrical boosting model. The results indicate that the locations and spacing of the electrodes have large impacts on the velocity and temperature distributions in the glass melter. With the same total heat input, the batch shape (which is determined by the overall heat transfer and the batch melting rate) is kept almost the same. This indicates that electric boosting can be used to replace part of heat by combustion. Therefore, temperature is lower in the <b>combustion</b> <b>space</b> and the life of the furnace can be prolonged. The electric booster {{can also be used to}} increase productivity without increasing the furnace size...|$|E

40|$|A {{new design}} of {{asymmetric}} non-premixed meso-scale vortex combustor is introduced in this paper. The flame stability, heat loss from the combustor wall {{as well as}} thermal efficiency and pollutant formation are compared in various circumstances such as air/fuel inlet velocity and equivalence ratios. Furthermore, direct photography method is used to capture visible flame structures at {{a wide range of}} equivalence ratios in order to emphasize the exceptional stability of such flames. An essential model for the stability of non-premixed flames in meso-scale <b>combustion</b> <b>spaces</b> is provided in this research. The temperature of the combustor wall {{is one of the most}} important factors that influence the temperature of the reactants (preheating phenomena) by heat conduction through the body. The results show that in the stoichiometric circumstance, when air mass flow rate is at the lowest rate (40 mg/s), the ratio of heat loss to heat generation reaches the largest value (around 55 %). The average temperature of the combustor wall increases with the flow velocity for the stable flame mode and remains mostly uniform and well distributed for the vortex flame in toroidal shape. At a constant airflow rates, the exhaust temperature increases monotonously with the decrease in equivalence ratio until the flame blows off. This implies that the maximum thermal efficiency of a meso-scale combustor occurs in its lean condition...|$|R

50|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, there have been {{numerous}} studies investigating the air pollution generated by traditional household solid fuel <b>combustion</b> for <b>space</b> heating, lighting, and cooking in developing countries. It is now well established that, throughout much of the developing world, indoor burning of solid fuels (biomass, coal, etc.) by inefficient, often insufficiently vented, combustion devices results in elevated exposures to household air pollutants. This is due to the poor combustion efficiency of the combustion devices and the elevated nature of the emissions. In addition, they are often released directly into living areas. Smoke from traditional household solid fuel combustion commonly contains a range of incomplete combustion products, including both fine and coarse particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5, PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and a variety of organic air pollutants (e.g., formaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, benzene, acetaldehyde, acrolein, phenols, pyrene, benzopyrene, benzo(a)pyrene, dibenzopyrenes, dibenzocarbazoles, and cresols).
