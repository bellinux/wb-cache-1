40|$|Although {{one feels}} that these numbers <b>couldn</b> f <b>t</b> be equal, Shanks [2] assures {{us that they}} are. Indeed, Follin (as {{reported}} by Spohn [3]) points out that one may take 5, 11, and 116 as indetevrninates subject only to the identity 5 = ll 2 - 116 (1) (which certainly {{is true for the}} usual interpretation of these strings of decimal digits). As we shall see, it is only the first 5 in A which needs to be given by the representation (1); the remaining 5 ? s may be treated as a separate indeterminate. The proofs of the equality of A and B given in [2] and [3] seem to be little more than appeals to the principles attributed to J. Littlewoods that "any identity, once written down, is trivial. " Please ask yourself the following questions before reading further: 1. Why does A = B seem so unlikely? 2. Given that it is true that A = Bs how can it be proved? The answers to both questions {{can be traced to the}} same source. Book X of Euclid's Elements [1]. Indeed, in Proposition 42, it is shown that a number expressible as a sum of two incommensurate square roots of rational numbers has a unique such representation up to interchanging the order of the summands. This deals with question 1. Much of Euclid f s work deals with more complicated algebraic numbers,albeit only oonstruotible numbers. In this analysis, repeated use is made of the rule yfa + S = a + b + 2 Vob, (2) which is employed forward and backward. That is, to take the square root of a quantity like 22 + 2 S, one solves a + b = 22 ab = 5 (3) to obtain a and b as 11 + VTL 6 and 11 - / 116. At this point, it is clear that our quantities A and B are the two different ways of associating 1 - /ll? + A using (2) to express the first sum that one takes in each case. Q. E. D. 62 [Feb.

Current examination showed a visual acuity of no light perception in her right eye (OD) and 1 / 10 in OS, intraocular pressure (IOP) of 24 mmHg in OD and 2 mmHg in OS.

Three weeks after the surgery the visual acuity is 8 / 10 OS and IOP of 8 mmHg OS. Iridencleisis consists in the surgical creation of a permanent drain by incarceration of a slip of the iris within a sclerocorneal incision to act as a wick through which the aqueous is filtered from the anterior chamber to the subconjunctival tissues. It was a popular procedure between 1907 and 1957 and was forgotten after 1968 Cairns s trabeculectomy.

40|$|ABSTRACT Does {{exposure}} of antineoplastic agents induce antimicrobial resistance in bacteria? Background: Children with cancer treated with antineoplastic agents are {{at great risk}} of suffering from infections during neutropenia. They often receive empiric antimicrobial therapy, and {{are at risk of}} aquiring bacteria with antibiotic resistance. There are studies that show an antibacterial effect of antineoplastic agents but we <b>couldn</b> <b>t</b> find the answer to the question: can repeated exposure to antineoplastic agents induce antibiotic resistance in pure cultures of bacteria? Material and methods: We created a very simple trial using the agar-diffusion method to expose five different antineoplastic agents (methotrexate, vincristine, 5 -fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cytarabine) at serum concentration levels each to Eschericia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) on Mueller-Hinton-agar. The experiment involved 50 overnight growth cycles. All the antineoplastic agents except 5 -FU are used in protocols for treatment of childhood cancer, and we used parallel exposure to NaCl as controls. The bacteria were susceptibility tested to 10 different antibacterial agents by Etest® before and after exposure to antineoplastic agents. Results: MIC-values from Etest® before and after {{exposure of}} antineoplastic agents for probably more than 10, 000 doubling cycles did not differ significantly. Conclusion: Repeated exposure to antineoplastic agents did not lead to reduced susceptibility or resistance against antibacterial agents in E. coli or P. aeruginosa under our experimental conditions. The conditions (time, complicated ecological situation with many species in close proximity etc.) in natural ecological niches in the normal flora of patients are however very different from our experimental method...|$|E

There is also rising of Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operational Expenditure (OPEX) while the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) is falling. This is a big challenge for mobile operators and equipment vendors. Maximizing capacity, improving quality of service and reversing the falling ARPU is required and this <b>couldn</b> <b>t</b> be achieved with the traditional RAN architecture. As a result, advancements in RAN architecture, data transport solution and transport protocol for the fronthaul have been done. In this thesis work different RAN architectures, C-RAN functional split options between BBU and RRH, data transport solutions and interface protocols for the fronthaul have been surveyed. Then, performance test has been done on a simple C-RAN implementation containing an open source core network, BBU and RRH with emulated User Equipment (UE) all from OAI. The implementation has been done with PHY-RF split between the BBU and RRH, which have been connected over Ethernet through Ethernet switch. Finally, analysis of measurement results, and comparison with theoretical results found from literature has been done. The performance test measurement results showed that a fully centralized C-RAN implementation with Ethernet as a fronthaul protocol cloud meet strict timing requirements of the fronthaul in terms of packet delay and jitter. Packets are observed arriving successfully before the delay deadline with a tolerable loss, but further work is required to improve the throughput and increase the separation distance between BBU and RRH...|$|E
40|$|What do X-rays, meteoroids, infant {{stars in}} the Orion Nebula, and our solar system have in common? Perhaps much more than anyone thought. Eric Feigelson of Penn State University {{stumbled}} onto a connection one day while his thoughts were far from the solar system, turned toward the vibrant neighborhood of young stars, hot gas, and caliginous dust of the Orion Nebula. This nebula, 1500 light-years away, is {{visible to the naked}} eye in the constellation Orion, a gem to behold with a good pair of binoculars or a telescope under dark skies. In Orion, Feigelson inadvertently found a possible solution to a long-standing mystery about our own solar system: the presence of exotic isotopes locked away in meteoroids. Scientists have assumed that these short-lived isotopes - special forms of atomic nuclei, such as aluminum- 26 and calcium- 41 - were transported here by a nearby supernova. Only tenuous evidence for such an explosion exists, but what else could have made the isotopes? The isotopes are about as old as the solar system, and the Sun <b>couldn</b> <b>t</b> possibly have been powerful enough to create them. Well, maybe we need to give the Sun a little more credit. Feigelson found that very young, midsized {{stars in the}} Orion Nebula - in the same stellar class as our Sun except they are only a million years old - produce powerful flares visible in X-rays. His team spotted these X-ray flares with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. These baby-tantrum flares are indeed energetic enough to forge heavy isotopes, Feigelson says. If the infant stars in Orion can do it now, then our Sun could have done the same when the solar system was forming about 4. 5 billion years ago, when the Sun itself was only a few million years old...|$|E
40|$|Multiresistant {{tuberculosis}} (MDR), {{defined as}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, {{is a growing}} problem worldwide. In year 2000 {{it was estimated that}} an average of 3. 2 % of all new cases of tuberculosis were multiresistant. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has focused on this problem, and studied its prevalence throughout the world. Some countries are defined as hotspots, meaning that primary MDR makes up a prevalence greater than 3 %. Hotspot countries include Russia, Latvia, Estonia, the Dominique-Republic and parts of India and China. One of the most important reasons for the development of MDR is the use of monotherapy. WHO has developed a treatment strategy, Direct Observed Treatment (DOT), which is recommended for worlwide implementation. At the National Institute of Public Health all isolates of M. tuberculosis in Norway are genetically analyzed. They use DNA-fingerprinting to identify the different isolates. A probe specific for a M. tuberculosis-sequence, IS 6110, is used. 17 patients were treated for multiresistant tuberculosis at Ullevål Universitetssykehus in the period 1994 2002. There are no Norwegians among the 17 patients with MDR. 12 of the 17 patients at Ullevål had the same IS 6110 -pattern, and therefore the same isolate. I found two clusters among these 12 patients, one with 6 patients and one with 4 patients. Two patients I <b>couldn</b> <b>t</b> find in any cluster. Most likely there is a link between all the patients with the same IS 6110 -sequence. One of these patients developed MDR during treatment in Norway, and eleven patients were most likely infected by transmission of the MDR strain developed by this patient. One other patient also developed MDR during treatment in Norway. Four patients probably brought their MDR strains with them upon arrival in Norway...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this Project {{is the study of}} the photocatalytical process of {{reforming}} alcohols in order to produce Hydrogen, using TiO 2 nanotubes as a precursor of the catalyst, and Copper as the electron transfer metal that coats the support. The TiO 2 nanotubes were prepared using the hydrothermal synthesis method, which consist in nanotube formation parting from P- 25 TiO 2 powder in a NaOH 10 M solution stirred and set at 110 ºC. After that the product followed a washing process via centrifugation, being the {{main purpose of}} that procedure the neutralization of the ph and the proper formation of the nanotube structure in our catalyst. Before centrifugation, other alternative processes were tried without success. The BET analysis done on the precursor revealed that the surface area was higher than the P- 25 used in the synthesis but still relatively low compared to the values found in literature. This was mainly attributed to the washing process nature, and the poor control over the temperature during the hydrothermal synthesis. The Catalyst was prepared using the Incipient Wetness Impregnation method coating the precursor with Copper. The Copper loading was 5 % weight of the catalyst. The reactions were performed in a photoreactor, and the wavelength selected for the UV irradiation of the reaction mix was UVC, and the alcohol selected to be reformed was Methanol. Since the concentration of MeOH in the reactor was fixed at 50 %vol, the only parameter that was changed was the total mass of the catalyst in the reactor. The experiences that were made involved catalyst mass of 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mg. The experiments with 150, 200 and 250 mg of catalyst load, led to a very small hydrogen production after 8 hours of reaction time. The hydrogen flow produced was detected by the Chromatographer but <b>couldn</b> <b>t</b> be quantified. For the reactions with 100 and 300 mg of catalyst mass, no hydrogen production was detected in 22 hours of reaction time.

40|$|O presente estudo tem por finalidade a análise das hipóteses objetivas de responsabilidade civil processual existentes no Código de Processo Civil. O tema abordado é dos mais atuais e relevantes, sendo, ainda, dos menos versados pela doutrina pátria, o que justifica a necessidade de maior aprofundamento na questão. A abordagem da matéria tem início pelos aspectos mais relevantes da responsabilidade civil, em seu viés genérico. A responsabilidade civil trata-se de tema que interessa a todos os ramos do direito, posto que, em regra, ao gerar prejuízo para outrem, no desempenho de qualquer atividade, estar-se-á diante da obrigação indenizatória. Ato contínuo, passa-se à análise do instituto quando o dano for causado por atividade processual. O processo, nesse contexto, configura-se unicamente no meio pelo qual o prejuízo a outrem é concretizado. Somente após estarem fixadas referidas premissas, são analisadas as hipóteses de responsabilidade objetiva constantes do Código de Processo Civil brasileiro. Para a realização deste estudo, aliou-se a análise de autores pátrios com estrangeiros, de forma a buscar o que de mais atualizado existe sobre a matéria em questão. Como não poderia ser, sempre se buscou corroborar as posições defendidas com jurisprudência dos tribunais brasileiros, demonstrando, pois, a atualidade do tema versado. É objetivo do presente estudo, portanto, uma sistematização da matéria concernente à responsabilidade processual objetivaThe {{purpose of}} this present study is the {{analysis}} of objective hypotheses of the civil liability proceeding existing in the Code of Civil Procedure. The addressed topic {{is one of the}} most current and relevant ones, and also the least versed by Brazil s doctrine, which justifies the necessity of further clarification on the issue. The approach of this topic begins by the relevant aspects of liability and its general bias. Civil liability is a subject that concerns all branches of law, since as a rule, by generating damage to another person in the performance of any activity one will be faced with the obligation of compensation. Immediately thereafter, civil liability is analyzed when the damage is caused by procedural activity. The process, in this context, is formed solely on the means by which the loss is carried to another. Only after the referred to assumptions are set, then the hypotheses of objective liability in the Code of Civil Procedure in Brazil are analyzed. For the accomplishment of this study, the analysis of patriotic authors came together with foreigners, in a way to seek the most upgraded information on this matter. As it <b>couldn</b> <b>t</b> be otherwise, defended views have always been sought to corroborate with the jurisprudence in Brazilian courts, therefore showing relevance of the versed topic. Therefore the aim of this study is a systematization of the concerning matter to the objective liability proceedin...|$|E
40|$|Trata-se de uma análise criteriosa da retramatização, forma de trabalhar com sociodramas criada por Arnaldo Liberman, que avalia suas possibilidades na pesquisa de papéis contemporâneos, aqui particularmente no papel de avós. Apesar de amplamente utilizada pelos psicodramatistas, não encontrei trabalhos que verificassem suas possibilidades e {{considerando que}} pudesse ser um bom instrumento de pesquisa, optei por analisá-la. A escolha da utilização do papel de avós justificou-se por ser um papel {{familiar}} sobre o qual existe menos pesquisa, frente ao papel dos pais, e também pelo envelhecimento da população, o que aumenta a oportunidade de sujeitos que vivenciam ou vivenciarão este papel. Realizei a análise de uma retramatização feita em um ato psicodramático público, confrontando os dados obtidos sobre o papel de avós com a literatura, e avaliei o próprio processo da retramatização por meio da qual estes dados foram obtidos. O papel de avó mostrou-se um papel de idoso, que dá ao neto uma sensação de importância e valor, permitindo a ele inserir-se numa história familiar com o reconhecimento de uma linhagem. Verifiquei que a retramatização permite ampla obtenção de dados sobre o papel pesquisado, propiciando confronto entre conceitos individuais e coletivos. E que, além disso, pode favorecer a promoção de saúde por meio da reflexão dos próprios participantes do grupo sobre os dados que vão obtendo no processo. Em algumas situações pode permitir um trabalho psicoterapêutico, ou axiodramáticoThis is a thorough analysis of re-plotting, a sociodramatic working method developed by Arnaldo Liberman, {{looking at the}} potential of this method in the research of contemporary roles, with particular emphasis {{on the role of}} grandparents. Despite of being widely used by psychodramatists, we <b>couldn</b> <b>t</b> find references in the literature with regards the potential of re-plotting, and as we consider it to be an appropriate instrument for research, our aim is to conduct a thorough analysis of this working method. The reason we chose to explore the role of grandparents is that there is significantly less research of these in comparison to the parental roles, and with the aging of the population the chances of people experiencing these roles have increased. We have analysed a re-plotting session that took place during a public psychodrama act, comparing the information obtained from this event with information from the relevant literature, and evaluating the actual process of replotting through which this information was gathered. It was shown that the grandparent role is a role linked with elderly people who give their grandchildren a sense of importance and self-worth, and allow them to feel part of a family history with the acknowledgement of their ancestry. It was also shown that through the use of re-plotting a wide range of information can be gathered about the explored roles, also allowing a comparison of individual and collective concepts. Furthermore, through group members reflections on the information obtained during the process, this method can also promote wellbeing.

40|$|Now here s a simple, {{straightforward}} {{story of}} success. The Agridoc network started in France just over 20 years ago, {{and for years}} provided a sound but basic service distributing documents about agriculture, principally to francophone Africa. Many Spore readers will know it from the 1980 s and 1990 s as the answer part of CTA s then Question-and-Answer Service. At {{the turn of the}} century Agridoc decided to modernise and change its service, explicitly building customer friendliness into it. This metamorphosis has led to a well-conceived and dynamic set of services, designed to ensure the widest possible dissemination of the wealth of agricultural information which Agridoc can now provide, with support from the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs. They work along the lines of cascades of information. Instead of operating from one centre, they are decentralising to eight regional service points based at existing organisations which are recognised as centres of excellence in providing customised services in agricultural information, and are often mentioned in Spore. At present, six are operational: at IPD-AOS in Burkina Faso, SAILD in Cameroon, INADES-Documentation in Côte d Ivoire, CITE in Madagascar, ENAM in Morocco and UTAP in Tunisia. At the heart of their services are two twice-yearly magazines, produced by the secretariat based at BDPA, near Paris. The first magazine, an information bulletin sent to all network members, is a wonderful collection of Spore-style news of technologies, networks, courses, Websites, a bulletin board of members, and reviews of new publications. Here lies the special feature of Agridoc: members can request a number of publications. If they are, or work in, an institution able to share the publications with more partners (known as Category 1) they can request copies or purchase them. Smaller groups (Category 2) with no organised dissemination can purchase copies, or obtain sponsored copies, or consult them at Category 1 organisations or the regional service points. There is also a Category 3, encompassing other networks, donor organisations and support bodies. The second magazine is thematic: recent issues have covered trends in local development and the liberalisation of livestock services. This is sent to all members, except for Category 2 organisations when their fields of interest do not include the topic in question. Most network members can also use Agridoc s question-and-answer and selective dissemination of information services, and obtain technical documents, manuals and guides from the Website, plus the range of (French-language) books produced for Agridoc by GRET. The latter are usually mentioned in Spore, and 2003 is likely to see a rich harvest of more of these books. Much of the information in the magazines, and the documents they describe, is in English and French; other services are mainly in French only. Want to join? Just ask. With their goal of 7, 000 members by the end of 2003 not yet met, the door is open to most applicants.

40|$|O tema de investigação desta pesquisa clínica em psicanálise é o estudo da difícil condição psíquica de algumas pessoas após enfrentarem a perda junto a um ser amado, tema que há algum tempo despertava meu interesse de estudo. Na prática clínica pude conferir que pacientes se apresentavam para atendimento em séria condição psíquica e em estado depressivo de difícil superação, o que por vezes vinha se estendendo havia anos. Era necessário {{investigar}} a característica da perda que os revelava sem sustentação interna para enfrentar e concluir o luto, o que conduziu ao estudo da natureza e das condições do vínculo com esse ser amado, sentido como tão absolutamente necessário. A pesquisa clínica realizada norteou-se pela hipótese inicial de que nestes pacientes teria ocorrido não apenas uma regressão, mas uma desmontagem do esquema defensivo erigido pelo eu com o propósito de manter, de modo subjacente e acobertado, as falhas da estruturação psíquica do sujeito. Assim, o colapso a partir da perda objetal, fosse por morte, ruptura ou grande decepção com o ser amado, colocava em primeiro plano os conflitos não superados junto ao objeto primário. A metodologia utilizada foi a construção de um caso clínico, a fim de buscar a metapsicologia em germe que ali se encontrava, consonante com uma pesquisa no âmbito da Psicopatologia Fundamental. A investigação teve por base, fundamentalmente, os esquemas conceituais psicanalíticos de S. Freud, M. Klein e D. W. Winnicott, pela perspectiva que ofereciam para o estudo do luto impossível e o conseqüente estado de ruína pessoal em que a paciente estudada se encontrava. Deste modo, foi imperativo o estudo de noções como o narcisismo, o processo identificatório e as características do processo de luto. Como resultado, foi possível conferir que o acometimento melancólico que produzia idéias suicidas na paciente encontrava-se relacionado não apenas a perdas objetais, mas ainda mais primordiais eram as perdas narcísicas sem chances de elaboração psíquica, em função das falhas desde os estágios primitivos de sua constituição subjetivaThe investigation {{theme of}} the present clinical research in psychoanalysis {{is the study of}} the difficult psychical condition presented by a few people after facing the loss of a loved one, subject that has interested me for a long time. During my clinical practice, I ve noticed that many patients came looking for treatment in a fragile psychical condition and in a depressive state which was very difficult to overcome, {{and most of the time}} these people had already been suffering for years. It was necessary to investigate the type of the loss that was manifested by these patients, who seemed to be unable to deal with the mourning and to elaborate it; this investigation led to the study of the nature and the conditions of the bond between the patient and the loved one, considered to be so absolutely indispensable. The clinical research was oriented by the initial hypothesis supposing that in these patients not only a regression had occurred, but a dismantlement of the defensive scheme built by the self with the purpose of maintaining, in an underlying and disguised way, the gaps in the psychical structuration of the individual. Consequently, the collapse originated from the objectal loss, either if it was due to death, end of relationship or a great disappointment towards the loved one, put the unsolved conflicts with the primary object in the foreground. The methodology applied was the construction of a clinical case, focusing on the metapsychology in germ that was presented by it, simultaneously with a research in Fundamental Psychopathology. The investigation was mainly based on the psychoanalytical concepts of S. Freud, M. Klein and D. W. Winnicott, due to the perspective they offered for the study of the impossible mourning and the consequent state of personal ruin in which the studied patient found herself. In other words, the study of the notions of narcissism, identificatory process and the characteristics of the mourning process was imperative. As a result, it was possible to verify that the melancholic access which produced suicidal ideas in the patient was related not only to her objectal losses, but mainly to her narcissistic losses that <b>couldn</b> <b>t</b> be psychically elaborated, due to the gaps that existed since the primary stages of her subjective constitutio...|$|E
40|$|Over recent years, {{the concept}} that many {{diseases}} can be aetiologically linked to infection {{by more than one}} pathogen has gained increased attention and awareness. Plasmodium falciparum (P. f) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are recognized co-factors in the genesis of endemic Burkitt s lymphoma (eBL), a high grade B cell malignancy, accounting for up to 74 % of childhood cancers in equatorial Africa. In this thesis, we have investigated the interactions existing between P. f. and EBV that could lead to the emergence of eBL. A special emphasis was given to the effect of malarial antigens on B cell homeostasis and EBV reactivation. During intra-erythrocytic proliferation of P. f, parasite-derived proteins are successively expressed, exported and presented at the surface of the human red blood cell membrane. The cysteine-rich interdomain region 1 alpha (CIDR 1 alpha) of the P. f erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP 1) harbors a multi-adhesive phenotype able to bind to CD 36, CD 31 and immunoglobulins (Ig). This led us to investigate the effect of P. f infected erythrocyte (IE) and CIDR 1 alpha, on purified human B cell preparations. Both IE and CIDR 1 alpha bound to non-immune B cells and induced polyclonal activation accompanied by the production of cytokines and antibodies. This effect was partially mediated by B cell surface immunoglobulins (a constitutive part of the B cell receptor). Nevertheless, the different gene expression profiles obtained comparing the activation signature of CIDR 1 alpha and anti-Ig stimuli suggested that other molecules/signaling pathways were implicated in this activation process. CIDR 1 alpha preferentially activated the memory B cell compartment and was capable of rescuing germinal center B cells from spontaneous apoptosis, promoting cell cycle entry. Polyclonal B cell activation is a prominent feature of malaria. We have identified the CIDR 1 alpha domain of PfEMP 1 as a T cell-independent antigen that induces polyclonal B cell activation, shedding light on a possible molecular mechanism leading to hyper-gammaglobulinemia during malaria infection. After primary infection, EBV establishes a life long persistence in the host, residing in a latent state in memory B cells. P. f infection is associated with elevated EBV loads. Different but not exclusive causative effects have been proposed: i) the impairment of the EBV-specific T cell response resulting from malaria-induced immunosuppression and ii) the expansion of the pool of EBV-carrying B cells resulting from malaria-induced polyclonal B cell activation. We and others have recently demonstrated that children living in malaria endemic areas have elevated EBV levels in the plasma indicating that the high EBV loads observed during malaria infection could also result from active viral replication. This led us {{to assess the impact of}} CIDR 1 alpha on EBV reactivation using the EBV positive BL cell line Akata as a model. Upon stimulation with CIDR 1 alpha, quantitative determination by real time PCR revealed an increased EBV load in the Akata cell cultures. The increased viral load resulted from lytic cycle reactivation as confirmed by experiments performed using an Akata line-based system in which the induction of lytic cycle was reflected by an enhanced expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). CIDR 1 alpha stimulation led to an augmentation of GFP positive cells. Moreover, the virus production in CIDR 1 alpha-exposed cultures was directly proportional to the number of GFP-positive Akata cells (lytic EBV) and to increased expression of the EBV lytic promoter BZLF 1. CIDR 1 alpha also induced the production of EBV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from healthy donors and from children with eBL. Our results demonstrate that P. f antigens, such as CIDR 1 alpha, can directly drive an EBV latently infected B cell into lytic cycle. We subsequently monitored the activity of all known herpes viruses (HHVs) infecting humans in saliva and plasma samples from children having acute malaria (day- 0) and 14 days after they received anti-malaria treatment (day- 14). Children with acute P. f malaria infection had elevated levels of circulating EBV, these levels being cleared after recovery. Acute malaria infection was not associated to an increased plasma load of HSV- 1, CMV, HHV. 6 or HHV- 7, as compared to the control groups (malaria day- 14 and malaria negative). However, we observed a profound reduction of HSV- 1 levels in the saliva after anti-malarial treatment whereas the salivary loads of other HHVs, including EBV, were unchanged. Due to the low detection rates of HSV- 2, VZV and HHV- 8 in our study, we <b>couldn</b> <b>t</b> draw any significant conclusions on their activity during P. f infection. Taken together our results suggest the existence of an intimate link between malaria and EBV. The elevated EBV loads observed during malaria infection seems to result not only from an impairment of the EBV-specific T cell response and polyclonal B cell activation but also from viral reactivation directly driven by malarial antigens. In conclusion, this thesis provides unique insights on the molecular mechanisms underlying polyclonal B cell activation and EBV reactivation during Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection and on how two pathogens can co-operate in lymphoma pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Jane {{is of the}} new {{generation}} of information professionals: open, enthusiastic, committed, demand-responsive. Between workshops at a CTA seminar on farmers organisations, she spoke with Spore about her work, deeds and dreams. Listen in to a chat under a tree. She has just said, intoning it three times, that 'Information is power'. Why is that so important to her? 'When someone has information and knowledge, they have confidence, and the skills to take informed decisions. ' Is she saying that a person is only a full person when they have full confidence, that some people she works with are not full people, not full farmers? In a way, she agrees. Some farmers do not have full confidence, even though they and their predecessors may have been farming for centuries. They have information about practical aspects, of course, but they do not have enough about the market. If you re a farmer and don t know what the market demand is, you may be producing maize very well, according to best farming practices, but there may be no market. And then you lose interest in your maize, because it has lost its value for you. What about the power angle, we wonder? Our work, Jane reflects, is about people having the power and confidence that comes from being informed. Most times people fear to stand up and speak, because they re not so sure whether they are going to say the right thing. If you re informed, then you re confident, you can say the right thing, or ask the right question at the right time. It helps you to be involved. She works in, she is, the information department of her organisation, we remark, so she must have the key {{to a lot of people}} s confidence. To some extent, she admits, I do, to their confidence and their power. I select information, and I am its gateway. In fact, I need more confidence to get more correct information. The other people working in our organisation could be the source, and I need them to appreciate the role of information more. They may be a scientist, agriculturalist, extension worker, or in marketing or credit, and when I ask them for an article, they may feel they have other, more important work. Do people really still think like that, we prompt her, in the 21 st century, in the information age, do some people resist? Not outright, we are assured, not intentionally. The thing is that most people do not appreciate information because it is not tangible, you cannot touch and feel it. An extension worker can tell a farmer about growing maize, about the spacing to use, and she shows the spacing; or about seeds, and she shows the seeds, and the farmer can appreciate. With information, it does not feel so immediate. She leans forward, wanting to sound more positive. Some people do appreciate information, though. Some farmers write into the Farmers Voice (FV) magazine. We joke, in passing, about how readers letters are at the front of her magazine and at the back in Spore, and about which is better. She tells of a farmer in the central region, whom she met at a workshop on effective communication. He told her 'I read an article about a farmer in another part of the country growing passion fruit and oranges, and I thought if my fellow farmer can do it, why not me?' Passion fruit is now his major source of income, and he is better able to survive. What he impressed on his fellow participants in the workshop was to appreciate knowledge, and to always seek it. For him, knowledge changed his life. There was another farmer I wrote about, he didn t know English, so he <b>couldn</b> <b>t</b> read it himself. He was read about even in Denmark, where UNFFE s major donor is. A Danish farmers organisation got interested, and when they sent a film crew to Uganda they visited him. Finally he was given a special course in extension work, because he was seen as a farmer who can pass on knowledge to his fellow farmers. Believe you and me, he has become very confident; when he comes to the office now, he s not the same person I met the first time on his farm. He s blossomed, he ll come and ask for this and that, knowing that he knows what other people want to know. Is everyone special like that farmer, we wonder? Not everyone: some read something, appreciate it and put it into practice, others will not do anything concrete. Is information, we chip in, a lot like seeds falling on fertile or stony ground, as in the Biblical tale? Jane develops the idea: it s not a question of stony ground. The land may well be fertile, but it may need rainfall. Some information may fall on its fertile land but it lacks rain. People s energy can do the same to information as rainfall to a seed. She talks proudly about her organisation s radio shows, its cassette libraries for farmers in six languages. About how each copy of FV is read by four people, how it reaches schools, how she wants to increase circulation above the current ceiling of 2, 000 and finance it with advertising. What has disappointed her? The printed press s scant coverage of agriculture. The attitudes of journalists wanting facilitation and editors putting in news about growing beans, but not bigger issues which affect policy. She fires herself up and talks about holding a workshop for journalists, to win their pens. Does she have a dream, a professional dream? Her eyes glitter more, her hand strokes the air firmly. I want to be in a network, helping get the right information to the farmers. There s a need for a one-stop shop but it hasn t happened yet because people she means investors, support agencies have not appreciated the value of information circulating. But, we all know, they haven t met Jane yet. Confidence personified.

40|$|Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) is {{a general}} term for information-and commuication systems aimed at making the {{transport}} sector more safe, efficient and environmentally friendly. During the recent years, cars have been equipped with numerous ITS applications such as parking assistant, cruise control and even collision avoidance systems directly interfering with the car to avoid an imminent collision. Car companies claim that autonomous cars, i. e. cars capable of driving without human interference, {{will be on the}} market {{by the end of the}} decade. Private Rapid Transport (PRT) is an emerging public transportation branch combining several different applications developed for ITS. The main difference between PRT and more tradition public transport systems is that the vehicles are operating on demand. When customers places an order, the system will summon the closest vehicle, which will pick up the customers and deliver them at the desired destination automatically. To avoid interference with other vehicles and pedestrians, the vehicles will run along specially built guideways usually separated by levitation. The goal is to make PRT a realistic alternative to the private car by offering close to the same privacy and flexibility. To offer the same flexibility as a car, the system must provide sufficient departure and destination stations. To achieve this, the guideways are intended to form a mesh network scattered all over cities and their suburbs. However, no operational PRT systems with more than five stations exist today. Lego offers a wide range of products spanning from more or less realistic models of trains and other vehicles to advanced programmable robots. Mindstorms is Legos robotic theme, which was introduced in 1998. In this thesis, I have used EV 3, which is the third generation of Lego Mindstorms. EV 3 features many different advanced sensors and both powerful and accurate servo motors that can be connected to and controlled by the EV 3 intelligent brick. By installing the Lego Java Operating System (LeJOS) on the intelligent brick, it is possible make programs in Java and use all the libraries included in the Java 7 Standard Edition. In addition, LeJOS makes the intelligent brick support WiFi communication, leaving developers with their imagination as the biggest restriction. The different pieces are designed to be compatible with each other in some way, regardless of age or theme. This means that a simple Lego toy intended for children under the age of ten can be rebuilt and combined with Lego Mindstorms to become a sophisticated robot. In this thesis I have rebuilt three carriage Lego City trains into a single carriage PRT vehicles, referred to as pods. The purpose of this thesis is to determine whether or not it s possible to simulate a real world PRT control system using Lego Mindstorms in combination with Lego City trains. Because it seems like no one else have ever attempted to do this, I have made a functional PRT system on my own. The process is thoroughly described in this report and the work is mainly divided into two objectives: 1. Design a pod that can drive to a given location with smooth and realistic movements 2. Design a higher level control system that can command the pods to move efficiently and safely between stations. 1. Although I used the physical pod design from my previous project at NTNU, designing the pods control program to keep track of the pods exact location was the most time consuming individual challenge in this project. Early on, I decided to use the color sensor to count sleepers, where each sleeper in the guideway represents a unique location. Because I could not find any other projects using the Lego color sensor for a similar purpose, I had to interpret the raw data from the color sensor and process it into reliable location data on my own. When the color sensor was able to detect each sleeper exactly once, it was relatively simple to calculate the speed of the pod because I knew both the distance and time between each sleeper. To make the pod stop smoothly at a given location, I decided to use a quadratic function to calculate the required braking distance based on the current speed. I also tested different approaches, but without the same consistency as the quadratic function. In the end, the result is a pod stopping at a given location with an accuracy of 10 cm. It accelerates and brakes smoothly. To communicate with a higher level control system, I have chosen to use MQTT. 2. I have chosen to use a control system architecture consisting of a central, multiple guideway controllers and one switch operator per guideway controller. The guideway controllers are responsible of one control area each. There is one control area per switching intersection in the guideway and pods can only enter a control area when ordered to by the guideway controller in charge of that control area. Because the guideway controllers are the only units that can allow a pod to move, it is responsible for the safety, i. e. make sure the pods do not crash into each other. In addition, the guideway controller sends switch commands to the switch operator located in its area. When a pod approaches a switching intersection, the guideway controller looks up the pods destination station in a table and orders the switch operator to switch the tracks in the correct location to route the pod the shortest path. The switch operator receives switch orders from the guideway controller. The switch operator is always aware of the tracks direction. If the tracks are in the correct direction when it receives a switching order, no further action is taken. If not, the tracks are switched in the correct direction by rotating a motor connected to the switch handle. The central was intended to assign orders to pods automatically and constantly monitor the position of each pod to be able to detect congestion and update the routing tables. Unfortunately, I did not have time to make the central automatic. However, I have made a simple graphical user interface where an operator manually can assign orders to pods. An order can be set to repeat, which means that the pod will drive constantly between the two given stations. By assigning multiple pods repeated orders to move between different stations, a lot of interesting situations occurs at both station tracks and merging intersections. When I tested the control system by only using a simple computer simulation, I was able to reveal some logical errors. When I had corrected all these errors, I tested the control system in the lab. This instantly exposed a lot of situations where the system failed, causing deadlocks where one or more pods stopped at wrong locations because it wasn t ordered to continue by the control system. After analyzing the results, I was able to correct most of the errors. However, I did not have time to make the system work perfectly. Nevertheless, most of the times, the system now works as intended for many minutes before an error situation occurs. By using the lab, I was able to expose errors I <b>couldn</b> <b>t</b> detect using computer simulations. In addition, it was much easier to understand the source of the errors from observing the pods behaviour. Based on this experience, I have found that Lego Mindstorms is sufficiently advanced and adaptable to simulate a simple PRT control system...|$|E

Organik iletken teknolojisinde yakın zamanda büyük ilgi gören OLED “Organic Light Emitting Device” materyaller; genel olarak, bir alt tabaka “substrate”, anot, iletken tabaka, ışın yayıcı tabaka ve katotdan ibarettir. OLED materyalin bir parçası olan ışın yayıcı tabaka organik molekül ya da polimerler olabilmektedir. Bu aşamada ışın yayıcı tabakanın “band gap” karakteri büyük önem taşımaktadır ve materyal kimyasında düşük “band gap” değerine sahip ışın yayıcı tabakalar aranmakta ve tasarlanmaktadır. Bu çalışmada sentezlenen bileşikler, grubumuz tarafından geliştirilen tiyofenden yola çıkılarak oluşturulan 1 - 8 -diketon tiyofen bileşiklerin LR (Lawesson Reaktanı) ve P 4 S 10 ile reaksiyonundan elde edilmektedir.

DTT türevleri üç adet sülfür atomunu yapısında barındırmasından ileri gelen elektronca zengin ve ileri konjuge yapısından dolayı organik elektronik ve optoelektronik teknolojisinde, politiyofenlerde olduğu gibi geniş bir uygulama alanı bulurlar. Elektronca zengin ditiyenotiyofen (DTT) temelli bileşikler elektrolümünesanlar, foton absorbanlar, floresanlar, fotokromizm, optiksel kromoforlar, ince film transistörler, radar absorblayıcılar, iletken polimerler gibi önemli uygulama alanlarında kullanılabilmektedirler. Bu bilgiler ışığında iletken polimer teknolojisine katkı sağlamak amacıyla elektronca zengin, düşük bant aralıklı iletken polimerler oluşturmaya yatkın materyaller sentezlemek için grubumuzca geliştirilen 1, 8 -diketondan P 4 S 10 ile halka kapama yöntemi temel alınarak sentezler yapıldı. Hedef Ditiyeno[2, 3 -b; 3, 2 -d]tiyofen türevlerine ulaşmak için 2, 5 -disübstitüe tiyofen, 1, 8 -diketon sentezi için kullanıldı. Sentezlenen 1, 8 -diketon türevi P 4 S 10 ile halka kapama reaksiyonuna tabi tutularak DTT türevleri elde edildi. Türevlerin oksidasyon ve redüksiyon potansiyel ölçümlerini kapsayan çalışma döngülü voltmetre ile gerçekleştirilmiştir. Moleküllere ait floresans ölçümleri alınarak optoelektronik çalışmalar yapılmıştır. Türevlerin elektropolimerizasyon yöntemi ile polimerleştirme çalışmaları başarılı olmadı. Çalışmanın devamında türevlerinin spin yoğunlukları Gaussian 03 paket programı kullanılarak DFT metodu ile (PCM(ACN) -UB 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) //B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 + G(d)) de C 2 simetrisi göz önüne alınarak hesaplandı. Sonuçlar tiyofen &# 945;-karbonunda spin yoğunluğu 0. 20 olan fenil sübstütiye monomerinin elektropolimerizasyon için en iyi aday olduğunu göstermiştir. Bunun üzerine hesaplama çalışmaları geliştirilerek, fenil sübstitüye monomerin dimer molekülleri üzerine çalışmalar yapıldı ve spin yoğunluğu hesaplandı. Karbon atomları spin yoğunluğunun neredeyse sıfır olmasından dolayı dimer molekülleri daha fazla polimerizasyona uğramamaktadır sonucuna varıldı. Tiyenotiyofen (TT) türevleri iki adet sülfür atomunu yapısında barındırmasından ileri gelen elektronca zengin ve ileri konjuge yapısından dolayı organik elektronik ve optoelektronik teknolojisinde, ditiyenotiyofenler gibi geniş bir uygulama alanı bulurlar.

OLEDs “Organic Light Emitting Device”, {{which have}} {{recently}} {{attracted the attention}} of the research groups, in general, consist of a substurate, anode, conducting layer, emissive layer and a catode. Polyheteroaromatic compounds are important because of their availabilities in helding conjugated conductive polymers. Synthesis of materials or polymers with low band gaps and investigation of their properties are very popular today as in the recent past. As a consequence of having a long &# 960;-conjugation and a rigid, non-flexible structure, succesful results were obtained by introducing fused-thiophene ring systems in polymer backbone. These two important features results in low band gaps and high intramolecular interactions in solid films. The emissive layer which is a part of OLED material can be an organic molecule or a polymer having a long &# 960;-conjugation and a rigid, non-flexible structure, succesful results were obtained by introducing fused-thiophene ring systems in polymer backbone. The low band gap character of the emissive layer has a critical role. Therefore, there has {{been a great deal of}} search in material chemistry to obtain an emissive layer having low band gap value. With this technology, low-energy-powered flexible display screens and obtaining a lighter and smaller circuit elements is possible. Thus, the construction of space age technology products as stealth aircraft invisible to radar or low-energy-powered touchscreen smart windows are not science-fiction anymore. Beside the electronic properties, biological activities of some thienothiophenes were also examined and effectiveness on HIV, hepatitis B and some nervous system diseases are reported. Due to the above-mentioned features dithienothiophenes, thienothiophenes and conducting polymers derived from them are used in the design and construction of magnetic and photosensitive receptors, some sensors, electrochromic devices (ECD), organic ligth emitting diodes (OLED), field effect transistors (FET) which are basic componenets of electronic circuits, solar cells which directly transform electrical current into light (photovoltaic). By the development of technology it has been easier to synthesise and characterize new compounds with additonal groups attached to extend their usage. Also, improvement of the technology provided us to achieve devices with alternative configurations, as a result, effective and practical usage in daily life. Beyond other significant and applicable monomers, dthienothiophenes (DTT) are now being used extensively in many device techniques. Our group have been focused on a different synthetic procedure which concludes with extended conjugations. Electrochromic device applications, biosensors, photovoltaics and fluorescence biolabeling are some of the examples that these class of compounds can be used in. With all the information obtained by the literature research and the synthetic experience that we have focused on, some DTT and TT monomers have been synthesized and investigated in this thesis. Monomers were characterised by 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, mass spectroscopy and their melting points were found. Their optic behaviours were examined. In the frame of the project, synthesis and investigation of the physical properties (CV, CV-UV, flourescence etc) of the highly conjugated dithienothiophene and thienothiophene based materials are planned. Dithienothiophenes (DTT) are formed by three fused thiophenes, which have six isomers, depending on the orientations of the thiophenes. They have been increasingly attractive due to their interesting properties in organic electronic materials. Presence of three sulfur atoms makes DTTs rich in electrons and good electron donor molecules, which are important properties for building blocks of wide variety of organic materials, having electronic and optical applications such as conducting polymers, electrochromic displays, electroluminescence, excited fluorescence, photochromism, nonlinear optical chromophores, transistors with high mobilities of on/off ratios, charge-transfer complexes and labeling for biological systems. Among the six isomers of DTT is the most studied one as the orientation of the fused three thiophene rings leads to a better conjugation. Considering its suitability for constructing &# 960;-conjugated systems, various synthetic methods have appeared in the literature including the method developed by our group, which led to the development of some interesting materials. It involves ring closure reactions of thiophenes containing 3 -mono or 3, 4 -diketones to form thiophenes or dithiins with the use of Lawesson’s reagent (11) or phosphorus decasulfide (P 4 S 10). In this study, as a continuation of our research line, the ring closure reaction was performed on thiophene containing 2, 5 -diketone to obtain 3, 4 -diaryldithieno[2, 3 -b; 3 _, 2 _-d]thiophenes (DTT) 2. Synthesis of Dithienothiophene functionalized with different substituents are carried out with the reaction of 1, 8 -diketon ring closure with P 4 S 10, which is the pathway developed by our research group. Treatment of 2, 5 -dibromothiophene with two moles of n-BuLi at&# 8722; 78 &# 9702;Cwas followed by addition of two moles of elemental sufur and then two moles of desired &# 945;-bromoketone to obtain the corresponding 2, 5 -diketones. The ring closure reaction of diketones was performed using P 4 S 10 in refluxing toluene to obtain the DTTs monomers between 10 % and 16 %. It is important to note that when an impure P 4 S 10 was used no product was obtained. The easiest way of identifying pure and impure P 4 S 10 is that while the impure P 4 S 10 has yellow color and bad smell, the pure one has very light yellow color and almost none or very slight smell. However, the lower yields of the DTTs is not related to the purity of P 4 S 10, as the same P 4 S 10 was used for the syntheses of the DTTs (dithieno[2, 3 -b; 2 _, 3 _-d]thiophenes), which gave higher yields up to 95 %. It is known that carbons 3 - and 4 - of a thiophene ring are less nucleophile compare with the carbons 2 - and 5 -, which could be the possible explanation for the lower yields of the ring closure reactions of diketons. The oxidation reduction behaviors of the DTT monomers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The voltammograms were recorded in acetonitrile/tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0. 1 M) solvent-electrolyte couple, using a CV cell consisting of Pt wire as working and counter electrodes andAg/AgCl as a reference electrode. Solutions were prepared as 1 × 10 &# 8722; 3 M, monomer concentrations and the experiments were conducted at room temperature. The monomers DTT, having R groups “H,” “MeO,” “Br” and “NO 2,” respectively, displayed oxidation potentials between 1. 19 and 1. 70 V. Regarding the nature of the “R” groups on the phenyl moiety, the oxidation potentials followed the order of NO 2 substutied DTT monomer (1. 70 V) > Br substutied DTT monomer (1. 51 V) > H substutied DTT monomer (1. 47 V) > MeO substutied DTT monomer (1. 19 V). While NO 2 substutied DTT monomer having strong electron withdrawing nitro group had the highest oxidation potential, the MeO substutied DTT monomer having strong electron donating methoxy group had the lowest oxidation potential. As a next step, their electropolymerizations were attempted. However, in spite of all the efforts, including different scan rates, altering the solvent-electrolyte couple, applying constant potential, etc., it was not successful. Rather than obtaining an increase at wave intensities of the CV curves, a decrease was obtained. In order to understand the behaviors of the monomers during the electropolymerization, a computational study was conducted. Many efforts were spent for the electropolymerization of DTT monomers. Although the studies using different scan rates or altering the solvent-electrolyte couple, neither with CV nor by applying constant potential, electropolymerization of DTT monomers <b>couldn</b> <b>t</b> be achieved. Computational calculations displayed positive radical spin densities at C 2 positions for DTTs and almost zero for dimers. Results were proved that the steric hindrance and the negative spin densities at C 2 positions of the dimer prevent electropolymerization. Summury, 3, 4 -Diaryl substituted DTT were synthesized, applying the diketone ring closure reaction, using P 4 S 10. All attempts for their electrochemical polymerizations were failed. Computational chemistry studies revealed that although the DTTs had enough spin densities for electropolymerization at carbon 2 - of the peripheral thiophenes, their dimers had spin densities less than zero, which prevented further chain elongation leading to their polymers. Same procedures were conducted for 3, 4 -dibromothiophene to achieve thieno[2, 3 -b]thiophenes containing bromine at 3 -position and para-substituted phenyl ring on 6 -position. Similiar to DTT prosedure, ring closure from monoketothiophene gives thienothiophene fused ring. 2 -bromothiophene was lithiated with n-buthyllithium, treated with elemental sulfur than reacted with 2 -bromoacetophenone and its derivatives containing methoxy, nitro and bromo substituents on the para-position of the phenyl ring. Obtained monoketothiophenes were reacted with P 4 S 10 to give thieno[2, 3 -b]thiophenes with phenyl ring (para-H, MeO, NO 2, Br) on 6 -position.

Considering its suitability for constructing &# 960;-conjugated systems, various synthetic methods have appeared in the literature including the method developed by our group, which led to the development of some interesting materials. It involves ring closure reactions of thiophenes containing 3 -mono or 3, 4 -diketones to form thiophenes or dithiins with the use of Lawesson’s reagent (11) or phosphorus decasulfide (P 4 S 10). In this study, as a continuation of our research line, the ring closure reaction was performed on thiophene containing 2, 5 -diketone to obtain 3, 4 -diaryldithieno[2, 3 -b; 3 _, 2 _-d]thiophenes (DTT) 2. Synthesis of Dithienothiophene functionalized with different substituents are carried out with the reaction of 1, 8 -diketon ring closure with P 4 S 10, which is the pathway developed by our research group. Treatment of 2, 5 -dibromothiophene with two moles of n-BuLi at&# 8722; 78 &# 9702;Cwas followed by addition of two moles of elemental sufur and then two moles of desired &# 945;-bromoketone to obtain the corresponding 2, 5 -diketones. The ring closure reaction of diketones was performed using P 4 S 10 in refluxing toluene to obtain the DTTs monomers between 10 % and 16 %. It is important to note that when an impure P 4 S 10 was used no product was obtained. The easiest way of identifying pure and impure P 4 S 10 is that while the impure P 4 S 10 has yellow color and bad smell, the pure one has very light yellow color and almost none or very slight smell. However, the lower yields of the DTTs is not related to the purity of P 4 S 10, as the same P 4 S 10 was used for the syntheses of the DTTs (dithieno[2, 3 -b; 2 _, 3 _-d]thiophenes), which gave higher yields up to 95 %. It is known that carbons 3 - and 4 - of a thiophene ring are less nucleophile compare with the carbons 2 - and 5 -, which could be the possible explanation for the lower yields of the ring closure reactions of diketons. The oxidation reduction behaviors of the DTT monomers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The voltammograms were recorded in acetonitrile/tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0. 1 M) solvent-electrolyte couple, using a CV cell consisting of Pt wire as working and counter electrodes andAg/AgCl as a reference electrode. Solutions were prepared as 1 × 10 &# 8722; 3 M, monomer concentrations and the experiments were conducted at room temperature. The monomers DTT, having R groups “H,” “MeO,” “Br” and “NO 2,” respectively, displayed oxidation potentials between 1. 19 and 1. 70 V. Regarding the nature of the “R” groups on the phenyl moiety, the oxidation potentials followed the order of NO 2 substutied DTT monomer (1. 70 V) > Br substutied DTT monomer (1. 51 V) > H substutied DTT monomer (1. 47 V) > MeO substutied DTT monomer (1. 19 V). While NO 2 substutied DTT monomer having strong electron withdrawing nitro group had the highest oxidation potential, the MeO substutied DTT monomer having strong electron donating methoxy group had the lowest oxidation potential. As a next step, their electropolymerizations were attempted. However, in spite of all the efforts, including different scan rates, altering the solvent-electrolyte couple, applying constant potential, etc., it was not successful. Rather than obtaining an increase at wave intensities of the CV curves, a decrease was obtained. In order to understand the behaviors of the monomers during the electropolymerization, a computational study was conducted. Many efforts were spent for the electropolymerization of DTT monomers. Although the studies using different scan rates or altering the solvent-electrolyte couple, neither with CV nor by applying constant potential, electropolymerization of DTT monomers <b>couldn</b> <b>t</b> be achieved. Computational calculations displayed positive radical spin densities at C 2 positions for DTTs and almost zero for dimers. Results were proved that the steric hindrance and the negative spin densities at C 2 positions of the dimer prevent electropolymerization. Summury, 3, 4 -Diaryl substituted DTT were synthesized, applying the diketone ring closure reaction, using P 4 S 10. All attempts for their electrochemical polymerizations were failed. Computational chemistry studies revealed that although the DTTs had enough spin densities for el...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2014 Kırmızı çamur, alüminyum üretiminde, boksit cevherinden alümina üretmek içinkullanılan Bayer prosesi sonucunda oluşan bir atıktır. Nüfus ve şehirleşmedeki artışa paralel olarak alüminyum talebi de artmakta olup, alüminyum üreten tesisler için kırmızı çamurun depolanması ve bertaraf edilmesi en önemli sorunlardan biri haline gelmektedir. Arsenik ise, metal ile ametal arasında özelliğe sahip olup, gerek doğal olarak gerekse antropojenik kaynaklardan ötürü yerkabuğunda yaygın halde bulunan bir elementtir. Doğada inorganik ve organik halde bulunan arsenik, toksik ve kanserojen sınıfına girebildiğinden, son yıllarda yer altı ve yer üstü sularında karşılaşılan en önemli sorunlardan biridir. Bu çalışmada, kırmızı çamurun arseniğin uzaklaştırılması üzerindeki etkisi araştırılmıştır. Öncelikle {{adsorbent}} olan kırmızı çamur ile arseniğin uzaklaştırılması için optimum pH değeri, karıştırma süresi vekırmızı çamur miktarı saptanmıştır. pH 2, 5 ile pH 10 arasında farklı değerlerde çalışılmış ve sentetik olarak hazırlanan çözeltilerden en iyi adsorblanmanın pH 5, 5 ta olduğu gözlenmiştir. Kırmızı çamur miktarının incelendiği deneylerde, 0, 5 gr/lt kırmızı çamurun az miktarda olmasına rağmen etkin olduğu anlaşılmıştır. Farklı arsenik konsantrasyonlarında da sürdürülen çalışmalarda, 100 ppm e kadar oldukça yüksek bir verimle elde edilmiştir. 100 ppm üzerindeki yüksek konsantrasyonlarda arsenik etkinliğini arttırmak için kırmızı çamurun ısı ve asit ile aktifleştirilmesi yoluna gidilmiştir. Asit aktivasyonu ile istenilen sonuç elde edilemezken, 600 °C de ısı ile aktivasyon sonucu arsenik gideriminde yüksek konsantrasyonlarda verim artışı sağlanmıştır. Arsenik giderimi için bir diğer adsorban olan piritin, kırmızı çamur ile birlikte kullanımının da etkisi araştırılmış; ancak kırmızı çamurun tek başına daha etkin bir adsorban olduğu görülmüştür. Sentetik arsenik konsantrasyonundan elde edilen veriler bir de gerçek atık suya uygulanmak istenmiş ve Eti Maden Emet Bor tesislerindenalınan doğal pH sı 9 olan 38, 5 ppm arsenik içeren atık su numunesi ile de çalışmalar yapılmıştır. Bunun neticesinde doğal pH da 4 gr/lt kırmızı çamurun dahi yetersiz olduğu, ancak pH 5 değerinde arsenik gideriminde oldukça başarılı sonuçlar elde edilmiştir. Son olarak bu çalışmaya bir atık değerlendirme olarak baktığımızda, kırmızı çamur atığının kullanıma elverişliliğinin de göz önünde bulundurulması gerektiğinden, nakliyesinde kolaylık olması açısından pelet haline getirilmesi düşünülmüş ve elde edilen veriler ışığında iri ve ince boyutta peletler hazırlanıp bir de bunların arsenik adsorbsiyonu üzerindeki etkisi incelenmiştir. Bunun neticesinde ince peletlerle daha iyi sonuçlar elde edilmiş; ancak numune alma süreleri arttıkça arsenik giderme veriminin azaldığı gözlenmiştir. Arsenic exhibits {{properties of}} metal and non metal. Due to both natural and anthropogenic sources, arsenic is the 20 th the most abundant elements in the earth s crust and is a component of morethan 245 minerals. These are mostly ores containing sulfide, along with copper, nickel, lead, cobalt, or other metals. Arsenic exists in nature in the oxidation states +V (arsenate), +III (arsenite), 0 (arsenic) and -III (arsine). Commonly inorganic arsenic appears {{in the aqueous environment}} in the states +V and +III as arsenous acid (As(III)), arsenic acid (As(V)), and their salts. It is usually found in the environment combined with the elements such as oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur. Arsenic combined with these elements is called inorganic arsenic. On the other hand if arsenic combined with carbon and hydrogen is called organic arsenic. Inorganic arsenic compounds can be methylated by bacteria, fungi, and yeasts to the organic compounds such as monomethylarsenic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and arsine. Arsenic compounds are used in wood preservation and insecticides, as an additive to lead and copper for hardening, glass manufacturing, in small quantities in semi-conductor manufacturing. Arsenic is carcinogenic and may cause lung cancer, bladder cancer, liver cancer, renal cancer, and skin cancer. It is also harmful to the nervous system. Other health effects may include vessel damage, high blood pressure, anemia, stomach sickness, and diabetes. The toxicity of arsenic depends on its binding form. Organic arsenic compounds are less toxic than inorganic arsenic compounds. It has been estimated that {{tens of millions of people}} are at risk exposing to excessive levels of arsenic from both contaminated water and arsenic-bearing coal from natural sources. Humans are exposed to this toxic by breathing, eating, or drinking the substance, or by skin contact. The current World Health Organization recommended value for arsenic in drinking water is 0. 010 mg/Land in wastewater is 0, 5 mg/L. Arsenic cannot be destroyed in the environment. It can only change its form, or become attached to or separated from particles. Therefore it is one of the main problems considering underground and ground source waters in recent years, because of its toxicity and carcinogenic. On the other side, aluminium is the second-most used metal after steel, largely because of its use in a wide variety of products. It is estimated that aluminium composes about 8 % of the earth s crust. Aluminium is a light silvery-white metallic element and it is resistant to corrosion. it is very reactive but forms a tough layer of oxide when exposed to air, preventing further corrosion and it is ductile and easily malleable. It is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity. Aluminium is used electrical equipments such as car, ship, aircraft construction; metallurgical and chemical processes; domestic and industrial construction; packaging and kitchen utensils. Aluminium is non-toxic (as the metal) nonmagnetic and non-sparking. It occurs naturally in many foods in very concentrations and is also present in many pharmaceuticals and drinking water. High levels in the body can be toxic. Production of aluminium from ore is dependent upon alumina, which is extracted from bauxite ore which contains 30 - 60 % alumina. The production of alumina consumes more than 90 % of the world s production of bauxite. The main minerals in bauxite are gibbsite (Al 203. 3 H 20), boehmite (Al 203. H 20), and diaspore. Bauxite ore refers to bauxite that contains sufficiently high levels of Al 203 and suitably low levels of Fe 203 and silica to be economically mineable. Red Mud is a waste left after alumina has been extracted from bauxite in Bayer process for refining bauxites into alumina via digestion with sodium hydroxide. This process can be separated into two parts; firstly the extraction of alumina from bauxite, and secondly the smelting of aluminum metal from alumina. Sodium hydroxide is used to dissolve the aluminum oxide. This produces a sodium-aluminium solutionfrom precipitated &# 12310;Al(OH) &# 12311;_ 3. Afterwards it is calcined to produce oxide, from which the metal is recovered. The remaining waste product of bayer process is called red mud due to the colour of the original bauxite ore and the iron oxide it contains. In addition to iron, it contains other particles include silica, unleached residual aluminium, and titanium oxide. For each tonne of alumina produced, the process can leave behind about two tonnes of red mud. However, This ratio is dependent on the type of bauxite used in the refining process. The red mud is a complex chemical soup, a watery slurry of fine rock particles and salts, containing toxic heavy metals. The red mud also has a high pH because of the sodium hydroxide solution used in the refining process. Therefore it is strong enough to kill plant and animal life, and to cause burns and damage to airways if it is breathed. Parallel to the increase in population and urbanization, the demand of aluminum is also increasing and as a consequence, storage and removing red mud becomes more and more important for the facilities produce aluminum. Therefore, cosidering the facts of both arsenic and red mud issues, in this study, the influence of red mud on removing arsenic from waters is investigated. The aim was, by using red mud as a low cost adsorbent, having a good efficiency of arsenic removal from waters and waste waters. Primarily, optimal pH for arsenic removal, stiring duration, and amount of red mud are determined. In the course of this study in a range from pH 2. 5 to pH 10 have been studied in many different values and the best in synthetic absorbable s concentration of arsenic is observed at pH 5. 5. Also it has been concluded that even 0, 5 gr/L red mud is enough effective for arsenic removal at pH 5, 5 with a concentration of 10 ppm arsenic. In other experiment, instead of synthetic arsenic, 38, 5 ppm arsenic contaminated water taken from Eti Mine Emet Boron facilityis used. The experiment performed in the original pH 9 and despite incresing the amount of red mud, good results <b>couldn</b> <b>t</b> be achieved which shows the importance of pH arrangement in the arsenic removal process. This study also investigates different arsenic concentrations, enough high yields is obtained up to 100 ppm. In order to increase the arsenic efficiency the heat, acid, and red mud are activated at concentrations as high as 100 ppm. While desired results could not be obtained by acid activation, with heat activation at 600 °C the yield increase is achieved with high concentrations. Pyrite is another adsorbant to remove arsenic. Although pyrite s removal effect together with red mud has been elaborated as well, it has been found that red mud alone is more effective to remove arsenic. In order to apply the data obtained by sentetic arsenic concentration to the waste water, some experiments has been conducted with natural pH 9 and 38, 5 ppm arsenic concentration obtained by Eti Maden Emet boron facility. As a result, it has been determined that at natural pH value, even 4 gr/L of red mud is not enough, but the yield quite rises at pH 5. It has been also worked with another waste sample from Eti Maden Emet boron facility which has a 81, 66 ppm arsenicconcentration. With this sample, it has been tried to see the effects of the amount of red mud in arsenic removal with a value of pH 5 in wastewater. As a result, with 4 gr/L red mud, it has been able to reduce the arsenic concentration to a level below 0, 5 ppm, which is the limit for permitted levels of arsenic in waste waters. For the application and the transportation with ease, red mud transformed to the red mud pellets by using starch. The adsorption experiments in a colunm system with two different size of these pellets show that with the fine pellets, better results are obtained. While the course sized pellet has a 42 % of arsenic removal efficiency in the samples taken after 30 minutes, the fine sized pellet has about 60 % of arsenic removal efficieny. On the other hand, these efficiencies are reduced with increasing sampling time. When the fine sized pellets are worked with the real arsenic contaminated water taken from Emet boron facility, about 80 % of arsenic removal efficiency is achieved. As a result, red mud which is the biggest waste problem of aluminum production either with the storage necessity or the disposal difficulties, is used for removing arsenic from the waters within the scope of waste utilization.
