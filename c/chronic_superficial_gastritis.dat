H. pylori were also confirmed with CLO and IgG- Helicobacter pylori test. Results: There were 92 patients (48 male (M) and 44 female (F)) who underwent endoscopical gastric biopsies between August 1998 and December 1999. Fifty six (60. 87 %) patients suffered from <b>chronic</b> <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis,</b> 11 (11. 96 %) from chronic atropic gastritis, 2 (2. 17 %) from chronic gastritis with metaplasia, 3 (3. 27) from gastric ulcer, and 2 (2. 17 %) from gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma. Twenty one (22. 8 %) patients was found to be H. pylori positive based on histopathologic examination with CLO and IgG-H. pylori tests.

Histological type - adenomatous, hyperplastic and fundic gland polyps - was diagnosed {{on the basis of}} at least three histological samples taken from the polyp. Biopsy samples were also taken from the antrum and the body of the stomach so that gastritis could be graded and classified, and the presence of H. pylori could be determined by histology. All 6, 700 patients, who had undergone upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in a one-year period, participated in this study. Among them 42 benign gastric epithelial polyp were found in 31 patients: adenomatous gastric polyps in 7 patients, hyperplastic gastric polyp in 21 and fundic gland polyp in 3 patients. All patients with hyperplastic polyps had <b>chronic</b> active <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis,</b> whereas most of the patients with adenomatous polyps had a chronic atrophic gastritis with high prevalence of intestinal metaplasia. Among 21 patients with hyperplastic gastric polyps, 16 (76 %) patients were positive for H. pylori infection in contrast to only 2 patients (29 %) with adenomatous gastric polyps and 1 patient (33 %) with fundic gland polyp.

Changes in the {{expression}} of the Notch 1 intracel-lular domain (NICD) and p 21 proteins {{have been shown to be}} closely associated with the development and progression of a number of cancers. The present study aimed to investigate {{the expression}} levels of the two proteins in gastric carcinoma and precancerous lesions, and to determine the clinical signifi-cance of this. A total of 109 gastric cancer, 57 precancerous gastric lesion, 50 <b>chronic</b> <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis</b> and 17 normal gastric mucosa patients were recruited for immunohisto-chemical staining of NICD and p 21 protein expression. The protein expression levels in the gastric cancer patient samples were associated with the clinicopathological and survival data. NICD protein levels were upregulated gradually from normal gastric mucosae through <b>chronic</b> <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis</b> and precancerous gastric lesions to gastric cancer tissues (P< 0. 01), whereas p 21 protein levels were downregulated accordingly (P< 0. 01). Increased NICD and a loss of p 21 expression were closely associated with tumor dedifferentiation, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, surface morphology and Lauren classification in gastric cancer. Thus, NICD expression was inversely associated with p 21 expression. In addition, the overall survival rate was greater in NICD- and P 21 + patients than in NICD+ and P 21 - patients, respectively (P< 0. 05). The COX regression multivariate analysis revealed that NICD+, p 21 -, depth of tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis were all independent prognostic factors for patients with gastric cancer. NICD and p 21 proteins are differentially expressed in gastric cancer and the aberrant expression of these proteins is associated with an advanced tumor stage, tumor metastasis and overall patient survival.

Eligible subjects were those with endoscopic diagnosis of <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis,</b> erosive gastritis or gastric ulcer. The biopsy specimens were taken from the corpus, angulus and antrum of all the patients. Giemsa and hematoxylin-eosin staining were used for the histological diagnosis H. pylori and gastric mucosa inflammation. Results: The overall prevalence of H. pylori infection in <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis,</b> erosive gastritis and gastric ulcer were 24. 3 %. There was significant difference between H. pylori infection rate in antrum of patients with <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis</b> 19. 4 %, erosive gastritis 26. 3 %, and gastric ulcer 34. 7 %. The positivity rate of glandular atrophy and intestinal metaplasia of <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis</b> with H. pylori- positivity was 12. 5 %, 14. 0 %; erosive gastritis 26. 3 %, 16. 6 %; and of gastric ulcer 38. 9 %, 29. 3 %; respectively. However, there was no significant difference. Conclusion: Patients with gastric ulcer have H. pylori infection, atrophic gastritis and metaplasia intestinal more than <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis</b> and erosive gastritis. Progression of the gastric ulcer to atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia is related to H. pylori infection...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 98 patients, who had {{undergone}} gastric surgery (23), or who had peptic ulcers (56), or who had normal endoscopic findings (19) underwent gastric biopsy, together with measurement of pH and total bile acid concentration, in their fasting gastric juice. The biopsy specimens were stained by the Warthin-Starry method for Campylobacter like organisms and were also graded "blind," {{as described in the}} preceding paper, for the five features that we believe may constitute the histological picture of reflux gastritis. The individual grades were added together to give a composite "reflux score" (0 - 15) for each patient. We found a notable association between the absence of Campylobacter like organisms and previous surgery for peptic ulceration, high reflux scores (greater than 10), hypochlorhydria (pH {{greater than or equal to}} 4), and increased bile acid concentrations (greater than or equal to 1 mmol/l) in the stomach. These findings further support our contention that reflux gastritis represents a distinct histopathological entity causally related to the effects of enterogastric reflux on the gastric mucosa and suggest that there may be two major categories of <b>chronic</b> gastritis: <b>chronic</b> <b>superficial,</b> or atrophic <b>gastritis</b> related to Campylobacter like organisms and reflux gastritis. Our data also imply that patients with peptic ulceration may, after gastric surgery, revert from being positive for these organisms to being negative and may undergo a possible transition from Campylobacter related chronic gastritis to reflux gastritis...|$|R
40|$|The faecal {{blood loss}} of six {{alcoholic}} subjects with normal gastric mucosa, six with <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis,</b> and six with atrophic gastritis was studied {{before and during}} ingestion of 40 % v/v ethanol using 51 Cr-tagged red blood cells. No significant change in faecal blood loss was observed in the normal mucosa and <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis</b> groups but all subjects with atrophic gastritis had significant increases of faecal blood loss during ethanol ingestion. These observations suggest that gastric mucosal morphology {{may be an important}} determinant of gastric mucosal bleeding during the ingestion of alcohol...|$|R
40|$|Background: Helicobacter pylori {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of peptic ulcer disease {{worldwide}} and a major cause of <b>chronic</b> <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis</b> leading to atrophy of gastric glands. Methodology: A total of 60 patients suffering from gastric disease due to H. pylori infection were evaluated. Endoscopy was performed and gastric biopsies were obtained for histopathology and urease test. Blood was simultaneously collected for the determination of the levels of vitamin B 12 and the MCV. Vitamin B 12 levels were determined by chemiluminescent assay. Results: Our results indicate that the mean vitamin B 12 level + SEM for the total population, the H. pylori infected and non-infected patients were 264. 5 + 22. 9, 207. 7 + 21. 9 and 419. 7 + 39. 8 respectively. H. pylori was found in 71. 7 % (43 / 60) of the patients tested. The level of vitamin B 12 was lower than 200 pg/ml (deficient) in 67. 4 % (29 / 43) of patients tested positive for H. pylori. Conclusion: H. pylori appears to be implicated in causing vitamin B 12 deficiency...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} functional results after Billroth I, Billroth II and Roux en Y reconstruction in subtotal gastrectomy. 45 patients were randomised between 1990 and 1995 and stratified in 3 different groups: 15 BI, 15 BII and 15 Roux. They were investigated by EGDS with multiple biopsies and upper gastro-intestinal scintiscanning, to evaluate gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) and dynamics of gastric emptying. Besides they answered a questionnaire: "Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index" (GIQLI). A reflux esophagitis was found in 5 BI, in 7 BII and in 2 Roux (p < 0. 001). No gastric lesions were found in 6 BI, in 5 BII and in 12 Roux, (BI vs. Y, p < 0. 05; BII vs. Y, p < 0. 001). <b>Chronic</b> <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis</b> was present in 9 BI, in 4 BII and in 3 Roux (BI vs. Y, p < 0. 05). Dynamic scintiscan demonstrated the presence of GER in 5 BI and gastric emptying was fast (37 ' < T 1 / 2 < 86 '), but incomplete (60 ' residual activity: 49 - 62...|$|E
30|$|DGR is {{physiological}} {{in humans}} (Ritchie 1984). Thus, reflux gastritis {{is found to}} be associated with the amount of bile refluxate. Antral biopsies revealed decreased and even no gastritis in patients with post-cholecystectomy DGR (Farsakh et al. 1995). In contrast, Wilson et al. have concluded that excessive DGR after cholecystectomy {{is found to be}} associated with persistent dyspeptic symptoms which correlated with high levels of bile refluxate and chronic gastritis on endoscopy (Wilson et al. 1995). Larusso et al. have also mentioned in a long term prospective study with ten patients that fasting bile reflux of total bile acids and DGR related gastritis increase progressively following the cholecystectomy procedure during the postoperative period (Lorusso et al. 1992). However, early onset of post-cholecystectomy DGR has presented comparable results with long-term reflux gastritis. Elhak et al. have found an increase in inactive form of <b>chronic</b> <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis</b> and reflux gastritis on postoperative first year (Gad Elhak et al. 2004). Aprea et al. have evaluated elderly cholecystectomized patients with control endoscopy on postoperative 6  months and have concluded cholecystectomy is a significant risk factor for biliary gastritis (Aprea et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|An {{endoscopic}} screening {{was carried}} out during the period between July 1989 and December 1991 in the Municipality of Roccagorga (LT) in order to: a) evaluate the presence of various forms of gastritis and pre-cancerous lesions; 2) verify {{the effect of the}} administration of prostaglandins (Misoprostol) on the evolution of <b>superficial</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>gastritis</b> (CG). A total of 468 endoscopy were performed (17 % of the population aged between 20 and 75 years old). 22 % of the subjects examined were found to be endoscopically normal; 34 % presented symptoms of mild esophagitis and 4 % of moderate esophagitis. The prevalence of duodenal ulcer was 10. 6 % and gastric ulcer 3. 4 %. Gastric carcinoma was diagnosed in 6 patients (1. 2 %). 8. 5 % of patients were found to have atrophic CG and 15. 3 % superficial CG. Thirty-six patients with superficial CG were randomly divided into two groups: A) treated with Misoprostol 600 mg/day for 6 months; B) controls (placebo). The administration of Misoprostol did not influence the evolution of CG, whereas it caused a reduction in the incidence of type 1 intestinal metaplasia. Misoprostol also led to an improvement in dyspeptic symptoms. The {{results of the present study}} do not suggest a role of prostaglandins in the natural evolution of CG...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY We {{determined}} {{the effect of}} postgastrectomy gastritis on serum pepsinogen I and pepsinogen II concentrations in 108 subjects with subtotal gastric resection. Eleven had normal remnant mucosa, 22 had <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis,</b> and 75 had atrophic gastritis. In the subjects with <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis,</b> serum pepsinogen I and II concentrations {{were significantly higher than}} in those with normal remnant mucosa, but the ratio of pepsinogen I to II did not differ from normal. In atrophic gastritis, serum pepsinogen I concentrations fell with increasing severity of mucosal damage, but pepsinogen II was persistently raised. Consequently, the ratio of pepsinogen I to II in subjects with atrophic gastritis was significantly lower than in those with <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis</b> or normal remnant mucosa. Discriminant function analysis revealed that the ratio of pepsinogen I to II, in combination with the absolute level of pepsinogen II, had a sensitivity of 80 %, a specificity of 73 %, and a positive predictive value of 87 % for atrophic gastritis in this population. We propose that the parallel increase in serum pepsinogen I and II concentrations in postgastrectomy <b>superficial</b> <b>gastritis</b> is because of an increased rate of endocrine release of both zymogens from the fundic glands, and that the dichotomy in pepsinogen I and II concentrations in postgastrectomy atrophic gastritis results from the loss of fundic glands, which produce bot...|$|R
