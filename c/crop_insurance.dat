Two type of insurances are available: (1) claim-based insurances, and (2) index-based insurances.

40|$|The thesis explores how students, {{acting as}} farm managers, {{mitigate}} risk by examining and analyzing their risk management decisions on crop choices. The research employs a farm management simulator to examine farming risk mitigation and a survey on demographics and management style {{to study the}} students’ level of entrepreneurial orientation (EO). The simulation game allows the student-participants to make decisions on crop choices and <b>crop</b> yield <b>insurance.</b> The EO survey on management style endeavors to unveil the reasons behind farm management decisions. The research specifically seeks to examine farm management decisions on crop choices (crop diversification) {{and the use of}} <b>crop</b> yield <b>insurance,</b> and to evaluate the relationship between farm management decisions and the level of EO. The purpose of the thesis is to verify if the level of EO, constructed from the dimensions identified in literature, helps predict farmers’ inclination towards crop diversification and <b>crop</b> yield <b>insurance,</b> and eventually their net farm income. The results of the multivariate panel data regression for four decision periods suggest that crop diversification and <b>crop</b> yield <b>insurance</b> have been adopted as mechanisms to mitigate farming risk. The results as well reveal that the participants’ level of EO determines their choice of crops. Participants {{with a high level of}} EO score grew higher-risk crops, a result consistent with other empirical studies on entrepreneurship. Besides, participants with high level of EO scores (those who grew higher-risk crops) were more inclined to use crop diversification rather than <b>crop</b> yield <b>insurance.</b> Moreover, the outcome from the panel analysis implies that the level of net farm income depends on the crop portfolio weighted risk index and crop diversification. The greater the crop diversification, the more the net farm income. The simulation game model mimics the crop choice decision-making activities of real-world farmers. Participants who mitigate risk by employing crop diversification strategies chose higher-risk crops in the simulation game. The study is a step toward developing an analytical basis for future empirical study in farming risk mitigation. Recommendations for future research are developed...|$|R
40|$|Pre-harvest {{corn and}} soybean options-based pricing strategies, and crop yield and revenue {{insurance}} {{were applied to}} model farms in three states. These combinations reduced income variability while increasing net incomes relative to uninsured harvest cash sales. Adding <b>crop</b> <b>insurances</b> to pre-harvest pricing reduced net incomes from those with pre-harvest pricing alone, but produced larger incomes than uninsured harvest sales. The Ohio model farm was modified to reflect (1) a debt-free operation, (2) a cash renter, and (3) a buyer-renter operation. No strategy was able to cover opportunity costs on investments for types (1) and (3). For farm type (3), mean net cash-flow returns were negative for harvest cash sales, but positive when pre-harvest pricing was added with and without insurance.

A significant amount of anti-poverty legislation was passed by Congress, including increases in social security benefits and in the minimum wage, several housing bills, and aid to economically distressed areas. A few antirecession public works packages, together with a number of measures designed to assist farmers, were introduced. Major expansions and improvements were made in Social Security (including retirement at 62 for men), hospital construction, library services, family farm assistance and reclamation. Food stamps for low-income Americans were reintroduced, food distribution to the poor was increased, and there was an expansion in school milk and school lunch distribution. The most comprehensive farm legislation since 1938 was carried out, with expansions in rural electrification, soil conservation, <b>crop</b> <b>insurance,</b> farm credit, and marketing orders. In September 1961, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency was established as the focal point in government for the “planning, negotiation, and execution of international disarmament and arms control agreements.” Altogether, the New Frontier witnessed the passage of a broad range of important social and economic reforms.|$|E
