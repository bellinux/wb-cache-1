5|$|There was a {{long history}} of {{painting}} candlelit scenes in Western art, although as Wright had not at this date travelled abroad, there remains uncertainty as to what paintings he might have seen in the original, as opposed to prints. Nicolson, who made studies of both Wright and other candlelight painters such as the 17th-century Utrecht Caravaggisti, thought their paintings, among the largest in the style, those most likely to have influenced Wright. However Judy Egerton wonders if he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> any, preferring as influences the far smaller works of the Leiden fijnschilder Godfried Schalcken (1643–1706), whose reputation was much greater in the early 18th century than subsequently. He had worked in England from 1692 to 1697, and several of his paintings can be placed in English collections in Wright's day.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum {{suggested}} that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting {{was inspired by a}} Peruvian mummy, which Munch <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting, Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles) and for the old woman at the left in his painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?. In 2004, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. Nonetheless, later studies have confirmed Rosenblum's suggestion, disproving the Italian theory, for Munch had not been to Florence until after painting The Scream.|$|E

25|$|Here we may remark on the {{tenacity}} {{with which the}} Murrumbidgee River long eluded {{the eye of the}} white man. It is scarcely probable that Meehan and Hume, who on this occasion were within comparatively easy reach of the head waters, <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> a new inland river at that time without mentioning the fact, but there is no record traceable anywhere as to the date of its discovery, or the name of its finder. When in 1823 Captain Currie and Major Ovens were led along its bank on to the beautiful Maneroo country by Joseph Wild, the stream was then familiar to the early settlers and called the Morumbidgee. Even in 1821, when Hume found the Yass Plains, almost on its bank, he makes no special mention of the river. From all this we may deduce the extremely probable fact that the position of the river was shown to some stockrider by a native, who also confided the aboriginal name, and so it gradually worked the knowledge of its identity into general belief. This theory is the more feasible as the river has retained its native name. If a white man of any known position had made the discovery, it would at once have received the name of some person holding official sway.|$|E
25|$|Charles' Vicar Herbert and {{his family}} were safely within castle Mategriffon, but after {{negotiations}} the rebels granted Herbert {{and his family}} safe conduct to leave the island upon a promise that they never return. After the restoration of order in the city, the townsmen announced themselves a free commune answerable only to the pope. They elected leaders, one of whom was Bartholomaeus of Neocastro who was prominent in the unfolding events and would later chronicle much of the revolt in Historia Sicula, an important if sometimes contradictory source of information for historians. Again significantly, the leaders' next act was to send word, via a Genoese merchant named Alafranco Cassano, to the Emperor Michael advising him that his nemesis Charles had been crippled. Only thereafter were ambassadors sent to Pope Martin IV pleading for each city on the island to be recognised as a free commune under the sole suzerainty of the Holy Church. The islanders were hoping for status such as enjoyed by Venice, Genoa, Pisa and other cities, free to form their own government, but morally answerable only to the pope who would hold a vague and unstable suzerainty. However, the French pope was firmly in Charles' camp and he directed the Sicilians to recognize Charles as their rightful king. But Martin underestimated the Sicilians' hatred of the French, and especially of Charles, who ruled from Naples rather than Palermo, where he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the suffering caused by his officials. Charles' island officials were far removed from his oversight; he did not see the avarice, the rape, theft and murder, nor did he see the high taxes levied against the meager possessions of the peasants, which kept them impoverished, but made no improvement in their lives.|$|E

500|$|The {{rings of}} Uranus are {{a system of}} rings around the planet Uranus, {{intermediate}} in complexity between the more extensive set around Saturn and the simpler systems around Jupiter and Neptune.

500|$|The first {{mention of}} a Uranian ring system comes from William Herschel's notes {{detailing}} his observations of Uranus in the 18th century, which include the following passage: [...] "February 22, 1789: A ring was suspected". Herschel drew a small diagram of the ring and noted that it was [...] "a little inclined to the red". The Keck Telescope in Hawaii has since confirmed {{this to be the}} case, at least for the ν ring. Herschel's notes were published in a Royal Society journal in 1797. However, in the two centuries between 1797 and 1977 the rings are rarely mentioned, if at all. This casts serious doubt on whether Herschel <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> anything of the sort while hundreds of other astronomers saw nothing. Still, it has been claimed by some that Herschel gave accurate descriptions of the ν ring's size relative to Uranus, its changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun, and its color.|$|E

500|$|Astronomer Michael R. Molnar {{argues that}} the [...] "star in the east" [...] refers to an astronomical event with astrological {{significance}} {{in the context of}} ancient Greek astrology. He suggests a link between the Star of Bethlehem and a double occultation of Jupiter by the moon on March 20 and April 17 of 6 BC in Aries, particularly the second occultation on April 17. Occultations of planets by the moon are quite common, but Firmicus Maternus, an astrologer to Roman Emperor Constantine, wrote that an occultation of Jupiter in Aries was a sign of the birth of a divine king. He argues that Aries rather than Pisces was the zodiac symbol for Judea, a fact that would affect previous interpretations of astrological material. Molnar’s theory was debated by scientists, theologians, and historians during a colloquium on the Star of Bethlehem at the Netherlands’ University of Groningen in October 2014. Harvard astronomer Owen Gingerich supports Molnar’s explanation but noted technical questions. [...] "The gospel story is one in which King Herod was taken by surprise," [...] said Gingerich. [...] "So it wasn’t that there was suddenly a brilliant new star sitting there that anybody <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> [...] something more subtle." [...] Astronomer David A. Weintraub says, [...] "If Matthew’s wise men actually undertook a journey to search for a newborn king, the bright star didn’t guide them; it only told them when to set out." ...|$|E

500|$|During the 1988 presidential election, Kennedy {{supported}} the eventual Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, {{from the start}} of the campaign. In the fall, Dukakis lost to George H. W. Bush, but Kennedy won re-election to the Senate over Republican Joseph D. Malone in the easiest race of his career. Kennedy remained a powerful force in the Senate. [...] In 1988 Kennedy co-sponsored an amendment to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibits discrimination in the rental, sale, marketing, and financing of the nation's housing; the amendment strengthened the ability of the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to enforce the Act and expanded the protected classes to include disabled persons and families with children. After prolonged negotiations during 1989 with Bush chief of staff John H. Sununu and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to secure Bush's approval, he directed passage of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Kennedy had personal interest in the bill due to his sister Rosemary's condition and his son's lost leg, and he considered its enactment one of the most important successes of his career. In the late 1980s Kennedy and Hatch staged a prolonged battle against Senator Jesse Helms to provide funding to combat the AIDS epidemic and provide treatment for low-income people affected; this would culminate in passage of the Ryan White Care Act. In late November 1989, Kennedy traveled to see first-hand the newly fallen Berlin Wall; he spoke at John-F.-Kennedy-Platz, site of the famous [...] "Ich bin ein Berliner" [...] speech in 1963, and said [...] "Emotionally, I just wish my brother <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Soviet {{intelligence}} {{services and the}} Soviet military used deceptive measures to conceal from the United States their intentions in Operation Anadyr, {{which led to the}} Cuban Missile Crisis. According to CIA analyst James Hansen, the Soviet Army most likely used large-scale battlefield deception before the Cuban Missile Crisis [...] "more frequently and with more consistent success than any other army." [...] The soldiers involved in Anadyr were provided with winter clothing and informed they would be going to the east of the Soviet Union. On board ship, intelligence officers allowed the 40,000 soldiers involved on deck only during the hours of darkness. The force, including missiles, reached Cuba before US intelligence became aware of it. Anadyr was planned from the start with elaborate denial and deception, ranging from the soldiers' ski boots and fleece-lined parkas to the name of the operation, a river and town in the chilly far east. Once America had become aware of Soviet intentions, deception continued in the form of outright denial, as when, on 17 October 1962, the embassy official Georgy Bolshakov gave President John F. Kennedy a [...] "personal message" [...] from the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev reassuring him that [...] "under no circumstances would surface-to-surface missiles be sent to Cuba." [...] Hansen's analysis ends with a recognition of the Soviet advantage in deception in 1962. In Hansen's view, the fact that the Killian Report did not even mention adversarial denial and deception was an indication that American intelligence had not begun to study foreign D it did not do so for another 20 years. Hansen considered it likely that with a properly-prepared [...] "deception-aware analytic corps", America <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> through Khrushchev's plan long before Maj. Heyser's revealing U-2 mission. In Hansen's view, it would take four decades before American intelligence fully understood the extent of Soviet deception before the Cuban Missile Crisis, especially the way the Soviets hid the truth of its strategic missile deployment behind a mass of lies, on [...] "a scale that most US planners could not comprehend".|$|E
500|$|Lucan's {{friends and}} family were {{critical}} of the inquest, which they felt offered a one-sided view of events. His mother told reporters {{that it did not}} serve [...] "any useful purpose at all". Veronica's sister, Christina, said that she felt [...] "great sadness and sorrow" [...] at the verdict. Susan Maxwell-Scott continued to press the earl's claims of innocence and claimed to feel [...] "awfully sorry" [...] for the countess. However, as Lucan remained absent, his description of [...] "a traumatic night of unbelievable coincidence" [...] came only from the letters he authored and the people he spoke with soon after Rivett's murder. While his fingerprints were not found at the scene, his assertions make no provision for the lead pipe discovered in the boot of the Ford Corsair, the claims by some that he discussed murdering his wife, or the lack of a viable suspect for the man he claimed to have seen fighting her. No sign of a forced entry was found, and officers attempting to demonstrate that Lucan <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> into the basement kitchen, from the street, could only do so by stooping low to the pavement. The basement light was not working, making it even more difficult to see into the room; its lightbulb (which was tested and found to be in working order) was found removed from its holder and left lying on a chair. Furthermore, Lady Lucan claimed not to have entered the basement that night, contradicting the earl's version of events; his wife's account is supported by the forensic examination made of the blood splashes and stains around the property. Some traces of her blood were found in the basement, the rear garden and on the canvas sack used to store Rivett's body; this may have been due to contamination at the scene. The man Lucan claimed to have seen could not have left through the basement's front door as it was locked, and the rear door led to a walled garden through which no trace of an escape was found. No signs that the man left by the ground level front door were discovered, and no witnesses reported seeing any such person near 46Lower Belgrave Street.|$|E
