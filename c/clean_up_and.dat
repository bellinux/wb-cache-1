5|$|Before {{the end of}} 1976, Bowie's {{interest}} in the burgeoning German music scene, {{as well as his}} drug addiction, prompted him to move to West Berlin to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> revitalise his career. There he was often seen riding a bicycle between his apartment on Hauptstraße in Schöneberg and Hansa Tonstudio, the recording studio he used, located on Köthener Straße in Kreuzberg, near the Berlin Wall. While working with Brian Eno and sharing an apartment with Iggy Pop, he began to focus on minimalist, ambient music for the first of three albums, co-produced with Tony Visconti, that became known as his Berlin Trilogy. During the same period, Iggy Pop, with Bowie as a co-writer and musician, completed his solo album debut The Idiot and its follow-up Lust for Life, touring the UK, Europe, and the US in March and April 1977.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 2007, President Bush {{signed the}} U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 into {{law for the}} wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that {{included}} an earmark of $3 million specifically for funding for programs for the remediation of dioxin 'hotspots' on former U.S. military bases, and for public health programs for the surrounding communities; some authors consider this to be completely inadequate, {{pointing out that the}} U.S. airbase in Da Nang, alone, will cost $14 million to <b>clean</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> that three others are estimated to require $60 million for cleanup. The appropriation was renewed in the fiscal year 2009 and again in FY 2010.

25|$|In 1916, Lang {{was elected}} mayor of St. Petersburg. During his {{four-year}} tenure, the city's population doubled as Lang relentlessly marketed the city's clean air, {{access to the}} ocean and relaxed lifestyle. As mayor, Lang established an ordinance making all benches in the city a standard size and the same color: green. Lang also extended the paving of streets {{and the construction of}} city parks along the waterfront with guaranteed access to the public. Lang took steps to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> revitalize the downtown area to include the construction of an open-air post office and the removal of store signs that were intrusive or offensive.

25|$|Prior to 1974, Bush Terminal {{was still}} an active port facility, with vessels that docked between its piers. In 1974, the City of New York Department of Ports and Terminals hired a private company to fill the spaces between Piers 1 through 4 to make space for parking {{shipping}} containers. Filling, however, was halted in 1978 after reports of environmental violations. New York City officials later learned that toxic wastes including oils, oil sludges, and wastewaters had been dumped at the site, making the four piers a polluted brownfield. In 2006, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Governor George Pataki announced a $36 million plan to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> redevelop the Bush Terminal piers. The plan included a $17.8 million grant {{from the state of}} New York, the largest single grant the state had ever awarded to clean up a brownfield site.|$|E

25|$|On flight day 9, mission {{specialist}} Greg Chamitoff and pilot Greg Johnson conducted {{a series of}} interviews with media outlets around the United States, including KPIX-TV, KGO-TV and KFBK. Later in the day, commander Mark Kelly and {{mission specialist}}s Mike Fincke and Chamitoff conducted interviews with The Daily, KDKA, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review and KTRK-TV. Johnson and mission specialist Roberto Vittori also completed some more equipment transfers between the station and shuttle, and began to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> organize the Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) Leonardo. The STS-134 crew furthermore completed some work on the Oxygen Generator System (OGS) and Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA). Drew Feustel, joined by Fincke and Chamitoff, spent most of the day preparing the tools for the following day's EVA. At the end of their day, the shuttle crew and Expedition 28 flight engineer Ron Garan conducted an EVA procedures review in preparation for the third spacewalk on flight day 10.|$|E

25|$|This {{could be}} a reason why {{environmental}} Kuznets curves {{have been found to}} be applicable to only certain types of pollutants. Yandle et al. argue that the EKC has not been found to apply to carbon because most pollutants create localized problems like lead and sulfur, so there is a greater urgency and response to cleaning up such pollutants. As a country develops, the marginal value of cleaning up such pollutants makes a large direct improvement to the quality of citizens' lives. Conversely, reducing carbon dioxide emissions does not have a dramatic impact at a local level, so the impetus to clean them up is only for the altruistic reason of improving the global environment. This becomes a tragedy of the commons where it is most efficient for everyone to pollute and for no one to <b>clean</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> everyone is worse as a result (Hardin, 1968). Thus, even in a country like the US with a high level of income, carbon emissions are not decreasing in accordance with the EKC.|$|E
25|$|Dozens of {{buildings}} were contaminated with anthrax {{as a result}} of the mailings. The companies in charge of the <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> decontaminating of the buildings was Bio Recovery Corporation of Woodside, New York and Bio-Recovery Services of America, based in Ohio. The decontaminating of anthrax spores in the building located in midtown Manhattan, is part of Rockefeller Center on the Avenue of Americas. It is home to the New York Post and Fox News, among others. Bio Recovery Corporation provided the labor and equipment, such as HEPA filtered negative pressure air scrubbers, HEPA vacuums, respirators, cyclone foggers, and decontamination foam licensed by the Sandia National Laboratories. Bio Recovery Corporation also received gratitude from New York City Mayor, Rudy Giuliani. Bio Recovery Corporation removed 93 bags of anthrax-contaminated mail at the New York Post alone. The decontamination of the Brentwood postal facility took 26 months and cost $130 million. The Hamilton, New Jersey postal facility remained closed until March 2005; its cleanup cost $65million. The United States Environmental Protection Agency spent $41.7million to clean up government buildings in Washington, D.C. One FBI document said the total damage exceeded $1billion.|$|E
25|$|Federal Actions {{to address}} the disproportionate health and {{environmental}} disparities that minority and low-income populations face through Executive Order (E.O) 12898, required federal agencies to make environmental justice central to their programs and policies. Superfund sites {{have been shown to}} impact minority communities the most. Despite legislation specifically designed to ensure equity in Superfund listing, marginalized populations still experience a lesser chance of successful listing and cleanup than areas with higher income levels. After the executive order had been put in place, there persisted a discrepancy between the demographics of the communities living near toxic waste sites and their listing as Superfund sites, which would otherwise grant them federally funded cleanup projects. Communities with both increased minority and low-income populations were found to have lowered their chances of site listing after the executive order, while on the other hand, increases in income led to greater chances of site listing. Of the populations living within 1 mile radius of a Superfund site, 44% of those are minorities despite only being around 37% of the nation's population. It has also been shown that the government responds slower to community demands from minority communities than from white communities. Superfund sites near white communities have seen better <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> harsher penalties for the polluters than minority communities.|$|E
