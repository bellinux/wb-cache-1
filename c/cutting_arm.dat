50|$|Used {{extensively}} in bookbinding, a board shear is a large, hand-operated machine for cutting board or paper. Like scissors, a board shear uses two blades to apply shear stress exceeding the paper's shear strength {{in order to}} cut. The stationary blade forms {{the edge of the}} cutting table, with the moving blade mounted on a <b>cutting</b> <b>arm.</b> Originally known as a table gauge shear because its gauge allowed the cutting of consistently-sized materials, the board shear resembles a larger version of the paper cutters commonly found in offices.|$|E
50|$|A {{remotely}} operated underwater vehicle (ROV) is a tethered underwater mobile device. This meaning {{is different from}} remote control vehicles operating on land or in the air. ROVs are unoccupied, highly maneuverable, and operated by a crew aboard a vessel. They are common in deep water industries such as offshore hydrocarbon extraction. They are linked to a host ship by a neutrally buoyant tether or, often when working in rough conditions or in deeper water, a load-carrying umbilical cable is used along with a tether management system (TMS). The TMS is either a garage-like device which contains the ROV during lowering through the splash zone or, on larger work-class ROVs, a separate assembly which sits {{on top of the}} ROV. The purpose of the TMS is to lengthen and shorten the tether so the effect of cable drag where there are underwater currents is minimized. The umbilical cable is an armored cable that contains a group of electrical conductors and fiber optics that carry electric power, video, and data signals between the operator and the TMS. Where used, the TMS then relays the signals and power for the ROV down the tether cable. Once at the ROV, the electric power is distributed between the components of the ROV. However, in high-power applications, most of the electric power drives a high-power electric motor which drives a hydraulic pump. The pump is then used for propulsion and to power equipment such as torque tools and manipulator arms where electric motors would be too difficult to implement subsea. Most ROVs are equipped with at least a video camera and lights. Additional equipment is commonly added to expand the vehicle’s capabilities. These may include sonars, magnetometers, a still camera, a manipulator or <b>cutting</b> <b>arm,</b> water samplers, and instruments that measure water clarity, water temperature, water density, sound velocity, light penetration, and temperature.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the Kamat-Riley (K-R) event-based Monte Carlo {{simulation}} method {{was used for}} reliability analysis of longwall shearer machine. Shearer machine consists of six subsystems; water, haulage, electrical, hydraulic, <b>cutting</b> <b>arms</b> and cable systems in a series network configuration. A shearer in the Tabas coal mine was selected as case study and its all failure data were collected and used for reliability analysis of subsystems. With negligible assumption of time to repair, a flowchart was built for programming the simulation process. The Matlab mathematical programming software was used for reliability simulation process. Finally the reliability plot of longwall shearer machine was achieved and upper and lower bound reliability were calculated. The results illustrate that the reliability of shearer machine reduces to zero {{in a period of}} 100 h. There is a 50 % chance that the shearer will not fail for the first 12 h of operation.

In the interior, the Italian troops confiscated livestock. By the end of the 1927, the Italians had nearly taken control of the sultanate. Hersi Boqor and his troops retreated to Ethiopia in order to rebuild their forces, but were unable to retake their territories, effectively ending the Campaign of the Sultanates.|$|R

40|$|A {{simple method}} has been {{developed}} that allows frozen thin sections of fresh-frozen tissue to be cut on a virtually unmodified ultramicrotome kept at room temperature. A bowl-shape i Dewar flask with a knifeholder in its depths replaces {{the stage of the}} microtome; a bar extends down into the bowl from the microtome's <b>cutting</b> <b>arm</b> and bears the frozen tissue near its lower end. When the microtome is operated, the tissue passes a glass or diamond knife {{in the depths of the}} bowl as in normal cutting. The cutting temperature is maintained by flushing the bowl with cold nitrogen gas, and can be set anywhere from about- 160 °C up to about- 30 °C. The microtome is set for a cutting thickness of 540 - 1000 A. Sections are picked up from the dry knife edge, and are placed on membrane-coated grids, flattened with the polished end of a copper rod, and either dried in nitrogen gas or freeze-dried. Throughout the entire process the tissue is kept cold and does not come in contact with any solvent. The morphology seen in frozen thin sections of rat pancreas and liver generally resembles that in conventional preparations, although freezing damage and low contrast limit the detail that can be discerned. Among unusual findings is a frequent abundance of mitochondria...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 84 - 86. A {{servo motor}} {{is to be}} used to {{position}} the <b>cutting</b> <b>arm</b> in a hypothetical pattern generation application. The motor is controlled in closed-loop in order to track, with zero asymptotic error, a reference signal represented by either a sinusoidal, triangular, or square wave. In addition, the schedule of reference signal type changes is not known a priori and the controlled system must achieve asymptotic tracking without operator intervention. As no simple single controller can satisfy these requirements for all setpoint types, a Hybrid Switching Control System is proposed which combines intuitive logic with standard control techniques. Under the guidance of a simple supervisor, the controller corresponding to each type of setpoint is switched {{in and out of the}} active feedback loop as required. A simple Multi-layer Perceptron neural network was selected to identify the type of signal being tracked and hence initiate controller switching. This network performed very well even in the presence of measurement noise, and the hybrid system automatically tracked each of the three types of reference signal over a wide range of signal amplitude and frequency. However, the reconfiguration interval was quite long (although still acceptable in terms of the proposed application), and the size of the neural net structure had to be limited for the system to work in real-time...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLast {{few decades}} have {{witnessed}} a rapid development in robotic technology. Different types of intelligent machines which facilitate various tasks in industry environment are becoming popular. This paper focuses on designing a low cost coconut tree climbing and harvesting robot. The kinematics and {{the motion of}} the robot are designed by referring to the motion of coconut harvester. The robot consists of two segments joined by a pair of threaded rods coupled to motors. The mechanical frame is designed in draft sight software and is implemented using aluminum segments and threaded rods. It has two arms driven by motors for holding. Locomotion of the robot is achieved using six motors out of which four motors are used in two hands and other two are used for upward and downward motion. The other part is a robotic arm for cutting down the coconuts. The robotic arm is attached on top of the climbing part. The operation of the <b>cutting</b> <b>arm</b> is done manually from the ground using a remote. The robot is automated using Arduino-Uno, motor H-bridge drivers, current and level sensors and other supporting circuits. The forward and the reverse motion of the motors are controlled by the Arduino through driver modules. Robot has automatic and manual functions fully controlled by the end-user. This paper has taken into account of the safety, reliability and the ease of use. A locomotion algorithm is developed to provide the robot with an autonomous capability for climbing. The prototype of the robot is implemented and tested successfully...|$|E
