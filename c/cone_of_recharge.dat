30|$|It {{is obvious}} that the {{pressure}} profile for the optimum alternative is smoother than for the «actual» one. In this case, the <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> depression of production wells are smaller and, as a result, they work for a longer time at the final stage of reservoir development. The range of pressure differential in the whole reservoir is less and the pressure over the most area of the reservoir is higher for the optimum alternative than for «actual» one (see Fig.  7). The optimization of reservoir development thus leads to the pressure equalizing inside the area and, as a result, to the stabilization <b>of</b> <b>recharge</b> area <b>of</b> each well.|$|R

The objective of this work is to apply a methodology that would make it possible to evaluate urban recharge at a regional scale, taking as a case study the city of La Plata (Argentina). In the study area, population growth and an increase in water demand has caused the intensive exploitation of groundwater with resulting alteration in groundwater flow. The methodology used was developed {{on the basis of a}} water balance and the simulation of the temporal evolution <b>of</b> the <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> depression and the volumes of water extracted from the aquifer. The method consists of adjusting the piezometry resulting from the numerical modelling to the measured piezometry, by means of the variation <b>of</b> the <b>recharge</b> parameter in the urban area. The results obtained make it possible to identify and quantify urban recharge, which in this case represents a volume of water similar to the recharge from precipitation...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{recharge well}} at the Water Resources Research Center Field Laboratory, University of Arizona, {{was used to compare}} the head losses for discharging conditions with the head losses during recharging conditions. For discharging conditions the formation loss coefficient, B, increased from an initial value of 14. 0 sec/ft^ 2 to an almost constant value of 16. 4 sec/ft^ 2 after 200 minutes of pumping. The initial value o B 1 or recharging conditions was 16. 8 sec/ft^ 2, increasing to a maximum of 18. 3 sec/ft^ 2 after 90 minutes <b>of</b> <b>recharge.</b> After 90 minutes 13 began to decrease, reaching a value of 16. 4 sec/ft^ 2 after 200 minutes <b>of</b> <b>recharge.</b> The decline in the rate of growth of B during pumping and the decrease in the value <b>of</b> B during <b>recharge</b> probably reflected a decrease in the convergence and the divergence losses, respectively, as the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> influence and the groundwater mound increased to a size such that the aquifer began to act more homogeneously. The well loss coefficient, C, had an average value of 6. 9 for discharging conditions. The initial value <b>of</b> C during <b>recharge</b> was 1. 4 which increased to a value of 4. 8 after 200 minutes. It is speculated that the increase was caused by plugging of the aquifer by entrained air and fine suspended particles in the recharge water. The results indicate that step drawdown pumping tests on a particular well with conditions similar to those at R# 1 can be used to estimate the magnitude of B and C in that well tor recharging condition...|$|R

40|$|The aquifer test, {{involving}} a production well and several observation wells near a stream, {{is one of}} the effects of induced streambed infiltration on water levels in aquifers. In presently available analytical treatments of flow problems associated with induced infiltration, recharge by the influent seepage of surface water is commonly simulated by use of a hypothetical image well. The assumption is made that water levels in the aquifer will behave the same whether recharge occurs over an area or through an image well. Electric analog computers, in which the streambed is simulated as an area <b>of</b> <b>recharge</b> in accordance with natural conditions instead <b>of</b> as a <b>recharging</b> image well, were used to appraise the accuracy of estimated effects of induced infiltration on water levels based on the image well theory. Electric analog computers for two aquifer test sites for which field data are available were constructed. The selected aquifer tests involve the two extreme aquifer-stream situations, i. e. the case where the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> depression spreads beneath and beyond the entire streambed and the case where the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> depression spreads only part way beneath the streambed. The analog computers consist of analog models and excitation-response apparatus. The analog models are regular arrays of resistors and capacitors and are scaled-down versions of aquifer-stream situations. The excitation-response apparatus consists of a power supply, waveform generator, pulse generator and an oscilloscope. It is concluded that, during induced infiltration aquifer tests, the image-well theory closely describes drawdowns on the land sides of streams {{with a high degree of}} accuracy whether the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> depression spreads beneath and beyond or only part way beneath the streambed. Drawdowns beneath or beyond the streambed and the streambed areas of infiltration based on the image-well theory are not those which are observed in the field. However, the streambed infiltration rates per foot of head loss based on hypothetical drawdowns beneath streambeds and streambed areas of infiltration computed with the image-well theory seem to be empirically correct.

The study examined their hydrogeologic and topographic origins and distribution, relationships to major fracture traces, quantity <b>of</b> <b>recharge</b> into the aquifer {{and degree of}} sensitivity towards degradation of the aquifer’s water quality. Groundwater traces were attempted to determine aquifer flow routes, time of groundwater travel, groundwater volume within conduits, and the aquifer’s capacity for dilution and dispersion <b>of</b> <b>recharged</b> contaminants. Trends in water quality were examined to quantify the volume and variety <b>of</b> contaminants <b>recharged</b> into the aquifer and {{to determine the effects}} of urbanization upon the Edwards Aquifer. The Edwards recharge zone was hydrogeologically assessed to rate the sensitivity of its areas. Socio-political impacts on recharge zone development were also examined. Based on the results of the above outlined research method, the conclusions of this investigation are that caves and sinkholes contribute substantial recharge into the Edwards Aquifer, rapidly transmit that recharge to the aquifer and are sensitive sites for potential contamination. The entire recharge zone was determined to be very sensitive to contamination. No significant differences were found between areas within the recharge zone to scale their degree of sensitivity. Major conduit flow networks were found to exist within the aquifer and their groundwater flow paths could be traced. Urban development <b>of</b> the Edwards <b>recharge</b> zone was shown to decrease the volume <b>of</b> <b>recharge</b> and degrade the aquifer’s water quality.

The effects of climate change are evident in all parts of the world which include significant weather pattern changes, effect on fauna and flora, see level changes etc. Groundwater recharge, which results mostly from rainfall in many areas of the dry zone, will therefore be different from what they are now. This study looks at the possible effects of climate change on the estimates <b>of</b> potential groundwater <b>recharge</b> in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The study locations chosen were Angunakolapellessa, MahaIllupallama and Kalpitiya, where estimates <b>of</b> <b>recharge</b> were obtained with a soil water balance model, programmed on a spreadsheet.
