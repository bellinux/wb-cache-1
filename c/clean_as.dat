5|$|Although {{the wood}} {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing {{the water in the}} wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped <b>clean.</b> <b>As</b> the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E
5|$|A {{similar story}} was {{published}} about Catherine Babington, first in her obituary, in Shelby, North Carolina, in 1886, {{then in a}} short book by her son outlining her masonic career. Hailed as the only female mason in the United States, {{she is said to}} have obtained the secrets at the age of 16 by hiding in her uncles' lodge room in Princess, Kentucky. Having lost her father at an early age, she spent much of her childhood at her grandfather's house, where she became a favourite of her uncles. They attended a lodge in an unused chapel above Catherine's school-room, which she often helped them <b>clean.</b> <b>As</b> a teenager, Catherine Sweet (Babington being her married name) attended lodge meetings for a year, hiding in the old pulpit, finally being discovered when one of her uncles returned unexpectedly for a rifle he had left in the ante-room. Being questioned by the lodge, it was discovered that she had committed much of the ritual to memory, and was, like Anderson, made a mason to swear her to secrecy, but in this instance not admitted to membership of the lodge. The sole source of the story is her son, and much of the detail remains unconfirmed. There is no account or recollection of such a lodge room in or around Princess.|$|E

She did not stand out academically although she was known for being clever and friendly. She was near-sighted and talked with a minor lisp during childhood. A family friend recounted a story years later about young Noether quickly solving a brain teaser at a children's party, showing logical acumen at that early age.

As Langan recalls: [...] "In those days of relatively limited technology we again had to push {{what we had to}} the limit... If, for instance, something required an effect, whether it be tape delay or phasing or some big, delayed reverb, the art was to get that effect right and record it... It all had to be done and then, as I said, it would influence the next process." [...] Langan has noted that balancing the backing vocals in the songs from the album was a major problem, due to no available terabytes of storage. He stated: [...] "We'd make it as <b>clean</b> <b>as</b> we possibly could, bounce that down to two tracks and then we'd erase." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{attention by}} film critics {{and seems to}} have been well-staged because a reviewer of The Moving Picture News states, [...] "This film points a moral and adorns a tale. <b>Clean</b> <b>as</b> a hound's tooth, sweet as a nut. Full of life. The tale of the triumph of a courageous girl, backed by an inimitable office boy, and the downfall of the grafter are well planned and well rendered. The copy room set our mind flying back to our own 'cub' days. By the way, the paper {{on the wall of the}} traction company office is somewhat weird. A good, healthy, vigorous production in every sense." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer said the acting was good, but found fault with the plot itself. The reviewer states, [...] "This film story has melodramatic interest, and the acting is good, but the means by which some of the incidents are brought about will not stand the acid test. For instance, if a political boss wants to 'shake down' a traction company for $5,000, would he submit the proposition in writing? ... The scenes in the newspaper reporters' room would have been more convincing in the first scene if the staff had been more busy in writing copy instead of waving their arms and moving about." [...] The term [...] "traction company" [...] refers to a streetcar company.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Larry David. Kenny Kramer claimed that there {{actually}} was a [...] "Contest" [...] in which David and some friends of his took part, {{although he did not}} initially want to take part because he thought he could not win it. David won the contest. When David came up with using the idea for an episode of Seinfeld, he did not talk about it with Seinfeld for a considerable time, because he thought the episode was impossible for him to pitch. However, Seinfeld thought it was not offensive. The original script was not revealed until the night before the cast read-through. The first version written by David was not as <b>clean</b> <b>as</b> the one later broadcast. The note from the censor claimed that David should not use the word [...] "Masturbate". Julia Louis-Dreyfus thought that the episode would never go ahead due to the subject matter. Seinfeld decided {{it would be better to}} remove any references to what George actually did. Seinfeld claimed that what was noteworthy about [...] "The Contest" [...] was the [...] "Dovetailing" [...] of the stories. He claimed that it probably would have been possible to have used the word [...] "masturbation" [...] in the episode (it is notable that in [...] "The Ticket"—an earlier episode in the same season—George says [...] "you must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation") although it would have probably ended up not being as funny. Part of the opening scene of the episode contains some of the script that was originally meant to be used in [...] "The Seinfeld Chronicles", the original pilot episode.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014 the UCS {{published}} an updated analysis of its 2012 report. The 2014 analysis found that 60% of Americans, up from 45% in 2009, live in regions where an all-electric car produce fewer [...] equivalent emissions per mile {{than the most}} efficient hybrid. The UCS study found several reasons for the improvement. First, electric utilities have adopted cleaner sources of electricity to their mix between the two analysis. The 2014 study used electric-utility emissions based on EPA's 2010 estimates, but since coal use nationwide is down by about 5% from 2010 to 2014, actual efficiency in 2014 is better than estimated in the UCS study. Second, electric vehicles have become more efficient, as the average 2013 all-electric vehicle used 0.33 kWh per mile, representing a 5% improvement over 2011 models. Also, some new models are cleaner than the average, such as the BMW i3, which is rated at 0.27 kWh by the EPA. An i3 charged with power from the Midwest grid would be as <b>clean</b> <b>as</b> a gasoline-powered car with about , up from [...] for the average electric car in the 2012 study. In states with a cleaner mix generation, the gains were larger. The average all-electric car in California went up to [...] equivalent from [...] in the 2012 study. States with dirtier generation that rely heavily on coal still lag, such as Colorado, where the average BEV only achieves the same emissions as a [...] gasoline-powered car. The author of the 2014 analysis noted that the benefits are not distributed evenly across the U.S. because electric car adoptions is concentrated in the states with cleaner power.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{recognition}} {{for the book}} was from children's-book critics, among whom it garnered acclaim. A Wizard of Earthsea received an even more positive response in the United Kingdom when it was released there in 1971, which, according to White, reflected the greater admiration of British critics for children's fantasy. In her 1975 annotated collection Fantasy for Children, British critic Naomi Lewis described it in the following terms: [...] " [...] the easiest book for casual browsing, but readers who take the step will find themselves {{in one of the}} most important works of fantasy of our time." [...] Similarly, literary scholar Margaret Esmonde wrote in 1981 that [...] "Le Guin has... enriched children's literature with what may be its finest high fantasy", while a review in The Guardian by author and journalist Amanda Craig said it was [...] "The most thrilling, wise and beautiful children's novel ever, [...] in prose as taut and <b>clean</b> <b>as</b> a ship's sail." [...] In discussing the book for a gathering of children's librarians Eleanor Cameron praised the world building in the story, saying [...] "it is as if [...] herself has lived on the archipelago." [...] Author David Mitchell called the titular character Ged a [...] "superb creation", and argued that he was a more relatable wizard than those featured in prominent works of fantasy at the time. According to him, characters such as Gandalf were [...] "variants on the archetype of Merlin, a Caucasian scholarly aristocrat amongst sorcerers" [...] with little room to grow, whereas Ged developed as a character through his story. Mitchell also praised the other characters in the story, who he said seemed to have a [...] "fully thought-out inner life" [...] despite being fleeting presences. The 1995 Encyclopedia of Science Fiction said that the Earthsea books had been considered the finest science fiction books for children in the post-World War II period.|$|E

500|$|When Cisneros {{describes}} the aspirations and struggles of Chicanas, {{the theme of}} place often emerges. Place refers not only to her novels' geographic locations, {{but also to the}} positions her characters hold within their social context. Chicanas frequently occupy Anglo-dominated and male-dominated places where they are subject to a variety of oppressive and prejudicial behaviors; one of these places that is of particular interest to Cisneros is the home. As literary critics Deborah L. Madsen and Ramón Saldívar have described, the home can be an oppressive place for Chicanas where they are subjugated to the will of male heads-of-household, {{or in the case of}} their own home, it can be an empowering place where they can act autonomously and express themselves creatively. In The House on Mango Street the young protagonist, Esperanza, longs to have her own house: [...] "Not a flat. Not an apartment in back. Not a man's house. Not a daddy's. A house all my own. With my porch and my pillow, my pretty purple petunias. My books and my stories. My two shoes waiting beside the bed. Nobody to shake a stick at. Nobody's garbage to pick up after." [...] An aspiring writer, Esperanza yearns for [...] "a space for myself to go, <b>clean</b> <b>as</b> paper before the poem." [...] She feels discontented and trapped in her family home, and witnesses other women in the same position. According to Saldívar, Cisneros communicates through this character that a woman needs her own place in order to realize her full potential—a home which is not a site of patriarchal violence, but instead [...] "a site of poetic self-creation." [...] One source of conflict and grief for Cisneros's Chicana characters is that the male-dominated society in which they live denies them this place. Critics such as Jacqueline Doyle and Felicia J. Cruz have compared this theme in Cisneros's work to one of the key concepts in Virginia Woolf's famous essay [...] "A Room of One's Own", that [...] "a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction," [...] or put another way, [...] "economic security" [...] and personal liberty are necessary for [...] "artistic production." ...|$|E
