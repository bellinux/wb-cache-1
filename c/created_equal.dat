5|$|We, the people, declare {{today that}} the most evident of truths—that {{all of us are}} created equal—is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall.... Our journey is not {{complete}} until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly <b>created</b> <b>equal,</b> then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{acting on}} these {{feelings}} and perceptions, Stanton joined Mott, Mott's sister Martha Coffin Wright, Jane Hunt {{and a handful}} of other women in Seneca Falls. Together they organized the Seneca Falls Convention held in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20. Over 300 people attended. Stanton drafted a Declaration of Sentiments, which she read at the convention. Modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence, Stanton's declaration proclaimed that men and women are <b>created</b> <b>equal.</b> She proposed, among other things, a then-controversial resolution demanding voting rights for women. The final resolutions, including female suffrage, were passed, in no small measure, because of the support of Frederick Douglass, who attended and informally spoke at the convention.|$|E

Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all {{men and women are}} <b>created</b> <b>equal.</b> For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling.

25|$|Unity of {{humanity}} {{is one of}} the central teachings of the Bahá'í Faith. The Bahá'í teachings state that since all humans have been created in the image of God, God does not make any distinction between people regardless of race or colour. Thus, because all humans have been <b>created</b> <b>equal,</b> they all require equal opportunities and treatment. Thus the Bahá'í view promotes the unity {{of humanity}}, and that people's vision should be world-embracing and that people should love the whole world rather than just their nation. The teaching, however, does not equal unity with uniformity, but instead the Bahá'í writings advocate for the principle of unity in diversity where the variety in the human race is valued.|$|E
25|$|The idea of freely debating {{rights to}} {{political}} representation took form during the Putney Debates of 1647. Beginning {{in the late}} 17th century, philosophers {{began to think of}} rights not as privileges to be granted by the government or the law, but as a fundamental part {{of what it means to}} be a person. John Locke (1632–1704), one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers, argued that property - which to him included life, liberty and possessions - was an unalienable human right, that is, one which cannot be taken away. He articulated that every person is <b>created</b> <b>equal</b> and free but, in return for the advantages of living in an organised society, a person may need to give up some of this freedom.|$|E
25|$|Tensions {{erupted into}} battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the British {{attempted}} {{to capture and}} destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in {{what became known as}} the American Revolutionary War (1775–83). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington. The Continental Congress determined King George's rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' rights as Englishmen, and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that all men are <b>created</b> <b>equal.</b>|$|E

After paying for her items, she sees a moto-sticker on a notice board which reads, [...] "All women are <b>created</b> <b>equal,</b> then some become Marines". The increasingly emotional Perry gathers her possessions from her car trunk, enters a nearby restroom, and begins her change of identity. She cuts her hair short (at this point bursting into tears), removes her bracelets, flattens her breasts, and changes into a hoodie and jeans.|$|E

To this principle of interpretation, all strict or narrow criticism, founded on its literal meaning, must yield." [...] If so, Hoar's assessment put Morton in the same category as U.S. Senator Charles Sumner, who openly declared the Declaration's decree that all men were <b>created</b> <b>equal</b> the defining words by which all constitutional duty should be judged.|$|E

The fourth day of July is celebrated annually as Independence Day. The Second Continental Congress declared on September 9 [...] "where, heretofore, the words 'United Colonies' have been used, the stile be altered for the future to the 'United States' [...] ".

The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states.

40|$|Multicultural Education is a {{field of}} study whose chief goal is to <b>create</b> <b>equal</b> {{educational}} opportunities for learners from diverse financial, racial, ethnic, social-class, cultural groups and rural schools. It {{can be viewed as}} an idea, an educational reform movement and a process (Banks, 2006 : 3). As an idea, multicultural education seeks to <b>create</b> <b>equal</b> educational opportunities for all learners, including those from different racial, ethnic, and social-class groups. Multicultural education tries to <b>create</b> <b>equal</b> educational opportunities for all learners by changing the total school environment so that it will reflect the diverse cultures and groups within society as well as the classroom. Multicultural education is a process because its goals are ideals that educators and administrators should constantly strive to achieve. Since South Africa is currently in a stage of transformation, our schools continues to grow more culturally diverse thus increasing unique challenges for educators and principals. As the South African population is diverse, so are the schools in terms of learner population. The fact that the learner population is becoming diverse in urban schools creates an increasing need for school principals to be equipped with the appropriate skills to manage cultural diversity at school level.
