5|$|A deck {{decompression}} <b>chamber</b> (DDC), or double-lock <b>chamber</b> is a two compartment {{pressure vessel}} for human occupation which has sufficient {{space in the}} main <b>chamber</b> for two or more occupants, and a forechamber which can allow a person to be pressurised or decompressed while the main <b>chamber</b> remains under constant pressure. This allows an attendant to be locked in or out during treatment of the occupant(s) of the main <b>chamber.</b> There is usually also a medical lock, which serves a similar function but is much smaller. This is used to transfer medical material, food and specimens {{into and out of}} the main <b>chamber</b> while it is under pressure. Most deck decompression chambers are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathig gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the <b>chamber,</b> so the <b>chamber</b> gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with <b>chamber</b> gas (usually air).|$|E
5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction <b>chamber</b> many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of the <b>chamber</b> wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side of the <b>chamber</b> is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction <b>chamber</b> walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the <b>chamber</b> is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction <b>chamber</b> is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the granite}} barrier the {{corridor}} branches eastward to a T-shaped magazine <b>chamber</b> which probably contained Userkaf's funerary equipment. The presence {{of such a}} magazine <b>chamber,</b> located under {{the base of a}} pyramid, is unique of all the 5th and 6th dynasty pyramids.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to changes}} in the Legal Profession Act {{introduced}} by the Kennett Liberal State Government many barristers at the Victorian Bar have opened their own <b>chambers</b> which operate independently from BCL.

5|$|Deck {{decompression}} chambers {{are used}} for surface decompression, described in a previous section. Most deck decompression chambers are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathing gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the <b>chamber,</b> so the <b>chamber</b> gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with <b>chamber</b> gas (usually air).|$|E
5|$|During the growth, the <b>chamber</b> {{materials}} are etched {{off by the}} plasma and can incorporate into the growing diamond. In particular, CVD diamond is often contaminated by silicon originating from the silica windows of the growth <b>chamber</b> or from the silicon substrate. Therefore, silica windows are either avoided or {{moved away from the}} substrate. Boron-containing species in the <b>chamber,</b> even at very low trace levels, also make it unsuitable for the growth of pure diamond.|$|E

Eventually, he became a member of both the Kentucky and Louisville Chambers of Commerce.

5|$|It {{was only}} in 1946, after the Japanese Occupation and the {{disbanding}} of the Straits Settlements, that the people were allowed to elect members into the Legislative Council. The Council then consisted of at least 22 {{but not more than}} 24 members. Only nine members were elected, out of which the Singapore <b>Chamber</b> of Commerce, the Chinese <b>Chamber</b> of Commerce and the Indian <b>Chamber</b> of Commerce were each allotted one seat. The other six seats were to be filled by democratic elections based on universal suffrage. Elections were held {{for the first time on}} 20 March 1948.|$|E

50|$|One thing {{special about}} the Supreme Court of Taiwan {{is that it}} has many <b>chambers.</b> Now there are 9 {{criminal}} <b>chambers</b> and 8 civll <b>chambers,</b> each consists of 5 judges. All the appeal cases are decided by these <b>chambers.</b> Because these <b>chambers</b> might have different opinions, the function of the Supreme Court to unify the construction of the law in the country is substantially diminished. In order to unify the opinions, judges in civil <b>chambers</b> and criminal <b>chambers</b> hold meetings regularly and make resolutions on legal questions. Those resolutions are not officially binding, but have de facto binding effect.|$|R
50|$|Barristers' <b>Chambers</b> Limited (BCL), {{a company}} {{owned by the}} Victorian Bar Council, owns a number of {{complexes}} of barristers' <b>chambers</b> in Melbourne.

5|$|The Alabama {{legislature}} {{passed the}} Cater Act in 1949, allowing {{cities and counties}} to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was {{the driving force behind}} the founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area <b>Chamber</b> of Commerce, believing its members were better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the <b>Chamber</b> of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally's IDB prompted the <b>Chamber</b> of Commerce to become more proactive in attracting new industry, the <b>chamber</b> effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions.|$|E

40|$|A mechanism, of {{formation}} of magma <b>chambers</b> that feed volcanoes is discussed. Heat conditions and dimensions of magma <b>chambers</b> which have existed {{for more than}} several thousand years may become stable. The approximate equations of heat balance of these <b>chambers</b> are derived by calculating the temperature T 1 of the magma entering <b>chambers</b> and the radii a of <b>chambers.</b> Calculations show that the radius of the shallow "peripheral" <b>chambers</b> of the Avachinsky volcano is less than 3 - 3. 5 km. Possible maximum radii of "peripheral" magma <b>chambers</b> were estimated for the Kamchatkan volcanoes of medial size. The temperature difference in their <b>chambers</b> may reach 100 - 200 "C.

5|$|The {{concept of}} the show was that each main event match was to be contested as an Elimination <b>Chamber</b> match. The Elimination <b>Chamber</b> is a {{circular}} steel cage, consisting of chains and girders, that surrounds the ring. Four 'pods' are enclosed within the <b>chamber,</b> one behind each ring post, which are on a steel platform surrounding {{the outside of the}} ring. Six wrestlers compete in the match; four are enclosed within the pods and released at random at specific time intervals, and two start the match. Wrestlers can only be eliminated via pinfall or submission, and the last wrestler left is the winner. For the Elimination <b>Chamber</b> pay-per-view, both WWE world championships, the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship, were to be defended in separate Elimination <b>Chamber</b> matches.|$|E
