40|$|In dye-sensitized solar cells, three {{structurally}} similar dyes {{are commonly}} employed to sensitize anatase nanocrystals, namely, the cis-bis(isothiocyanato) bis(2, 2 ′-bipyridyl- 4, 4 ′-dicarboxylato) -ruthenium(II) dye (N 3) and its twice deprotonated (N 719) and completely deprotonated (N 712) forms. Using density functional theory, several possible binding geometries of these dyes are identified on the anatase(101) surface. Computed relative energies show that protonation {{of the surface}} can strongly influence the relative stabilities of these configurations and could induce a conformational transition from double bidentate-bridged binding to mixed bidentate/ monodentate binding.

Use of a pentafluorophenyl (PFP) activated ester chain transfer agent (CTA) provided a polymer with an R end {{group that was}} reactive toward amines and a dithioester ω end group. The R PFP ester was amidated with Oregon Green Cadaverin. This did not harm the ω dithioester, which was subsequently aminolyzed with an excess of n-propylamine {{in the presence of}} Texas Red- 2 -sulfonamidoethyl methanethiosulfonate, resulting in a disulfide bond connecting the second dye to the polymer <b>chain.</b> Excess <b>dyes</b> and side products were removed by thin layer chromatography (TLC).

The {{synthesis of}} the polymer by a living radical technique and the mild complementary conjugation methods conducted after polymerization at each end group allowed to introduce complex dye residues possessing high brightness and photostability. In particular, fluorescent dyes capable of acting as donor and acceptor for electronic excitation energy transfer were chosen. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were used to determine the time constant of energy transfer between the end groups of isolated polymer chains.

The long carbon <b>chain</b> carbocyanine <b>dyes</b> we use are lipid-soluble and so become incorporated into the plasma membrane. Neurons can be labeled either retrogradely or during dissociation.

These dyes do not affect the survival, development, or basic physiological properties of neurons and do not spread detectably from labeled to unlabeled neurons. It seems likely that cells become retrogradely labeled mainly by lateral diffusion of dye in the plane of the membrane. If so, carbocyanine dyes may be most useful for retrograde labeling over relatively short distances. An additional feature of carbocyanine labeling is that neuronal processes are brightly fluorescent for the first few days in culture, presumably because dye rapidly diffuses into newly inserted membrane. We have used carbocyanine dyes to identify sympathetic preganglionic neurons in culture. Our results indicate that preganglionic neurons can survive in the absence of their target cells and that several aspects of their differentiation in the absence of target appear normal...|$|R

All dyes studied altered membrane permeability properties; however these alterations were much larger at lower (e. g. 10 (- 3) M) than at higher (e. g. 10 (- 1) M) ionic strengths. The data suggest that such perturbations would not be troublesome for most biological preparations in which these dyes have been studied. The mechanisms by which these dyes alter membrane permeabilities vary in going from short-chained to long-chained dyes, the former forming voltage-gated, ion-permeant pores and the latter acting predominantly as anion carriers (forming 2 : 1 dye-anion complexes).

The unexpected pattern is observed that one end of each molecule tends to stretch out in the electric field while the other end remains quiescent for some time before it snaps forward and the stretch-recoil cycle repeats. These features are neither predicted by prevailing theories of electrophoresis mechanism nor detectable by conventional whole-chain labeling methods, which demonstrate pragmatically the usefulness of modular stitching to reveal internal chain dynamics of single molecules. close 1...|$|R

It {{can be seen from}} the Table  1 that the color shade of denim garments decreased significantly after they were exposed to cellulase treatment particularly at higher concentrations of 2.0 % to 3.0 %. During washing, the part of the primary wall of cotton is always in contact with cellulase, so at the contact point, fiber surfaces are hydrolyzed by the catalysis of the cellulase and then treated garments become duller and color is faded. The hair-like cotton fibrils are degraded first and partly detached from the main fiber <b>chain</b> and indigo <b>dye</b> bonds are broken from the yarn surface. Rotating garments inside washing machine hydrolyzes more bonds due to mechanical friction, restores their original white color. The results disclose that increasing the cellulase concentration from 3.0 to 3.5 % has no effect on color shade change, because with 3.0 % cellulase concentration most of the indigo dyes are loosened from the fabric surface and no dyes are remain on fabric surface. Therefore no effect found on color shade change when increased cellulase concentration 3.0 to 3.5 %. From Table  1 it can also be seen that 2 % cellulase concentration is the optimum result for color fading.|$|R

The DA monomers within the mixed monolayers have been polymerized in situ at the air/water interface.

The polymerization of DA proceeds with no phase segregation, exclusively leading to the red polydiacetylene form. The kinetics of polymerization at the air/water interface has been monitored in situ by GIXD. The experimental results have been combined with Molecular Mechanics computer simulations, revealing that DA molecules are sequentially arranged with molecules of Hemicyanine dye in alternating rows.

40|$|Highly fluorescent, discotic trioxatriangulenium dyes were aligned {{by simple}} spin-casting on {{substrates}} with friction transferred PTFE layers.

Gracing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXD) unambiguously allowed {{the determination of}} a long-range order unit cell {{as well as its}} orientation with respect to the PTFE fibers. Further analysis of the X-ray data, in conjunction with polarized absorption spectroscopy, suggest a lamellar packing model with alternating layers of alkyl <b>chains</b> and ionic <b>dyes</b> oriented parallel to the substrate. This structure results in a highly anisotropic electrostatic potential around the cationic chromophore, causing cant shifts in energy and orientation of the optical transitions. Thus, the optical properties of the material are, to a large extent, controlled by the position of the otherwise inert PF 6 - counterions. The bright fluorescence from the films is also polarized parallel to the PTFE alignment layer. Doping of the thin films with fluorescent energy acceptor traps shows that efficient exciton migration takes place in the thin films.

These measurements indicated that the membrane:water partition coefficient for the dye monomer increases with the length of the hydrocarbon side chain. However, the formation of large aggregates in the aqueous phase also increases with increasing chain length and ionic strength so that the actual dye adsorbing to the membrane goes through a maximum at high but not at low ionic strengths. More dye adsorbs to negatively charged than neutral membranes. Membrane-bound dye spectra were easily resolved in negatively charged liposomes where it was observed that these dyes could exist as monomers, dimers, and large aggregates. For diSC 1 (5) a spectral peak was observed at low but not high ionic strengths (i. e. the conditions in which this dye appears to form voltage-gated channels) corresponding to small aggregates which appeared to adsorb to the membrane.

40|$|Based on {{the known}} reverse saturable {{absorption}} properties of certain coumarin and long <b>chain</b> polymethine <b>dyes,</b> {{the synthesis of}} new related structures was undertaken {{in order to examine}} the relationships between structure and RSA activity. It was hoped that in this way, more effective RSA chromophores could be synthesised. In addition to RSA activity (at 532 nm) the general light absorption and fluorescence characteristics of the new dye materials were examined. In the first series of dyes, the 7 -diethylaminocoumarin system with extensively conjugated acceptor groups in the 3 -position were examined. Several dyes with absorption maxima in the range 500 - 700 nm were prepared, but none showed RSA properties at 532 nm. The poor photostability properties of these dyes prompted the synthesis of related fused ring systems derived from 4 -chloro- 7 -diethylamino- 3 -formyl-coumarin and in at least one example a marked improvement in photostability was achieved. In an attempt to move the absorption maxima of the coumarin dyes into the near infrared, chromophores with extended chains containing an isophorone bridge were introduced into the 3 -position of the coumarin system. Although this gave greater conjugation and an increase in structural rigidity, Amax values could not be obtained at wavelengths greater than about 570 nm, and photostability properties of the dyes were poor. Condensation of active methylene compounds with 2 -chloro-l-formyl- 3 -hydroxymethylenecyclohexene led to the synthesis of a series of extended donoracceptor chromophores containing a chlorocyclohexene bridge, where the donor was the 1, 3, 3 -trimethylindoline ring system. Absorption maxima of the dyes ranged from 620 - 860 nm. However, none showed RSA properties and their photostability in cellulose acetate film was generally poor. In an attempt to improve photostability the intermediate formed from 2 -methylene-l, 3, 3 -trimethylindoline (Fischer's base) and 2 -chloro-l-formyl- 3 -hydromethylenecyclohexene was condensed with active methylene compounds containing groups capable of intramolecular nucleophilic displacement of the chlorine atom. Thus under suitably forcing reaction conditions intramolecular cyclisation occurred, giving a series of extended donor-acceptor chromophores containing fused heterocyclic residues, the absorption maxima of these new chromophores ranging from 540 - 730 nm. However, resultant increase in molecular rigidity did not give the expected improvement in photostability. In a further attempt to prepare RSA active chromophores, selected symmetrical polymethine dyes were synthesised and evaluated. All showed a measurable RSA effect at 532 nm but in particular, near-infrared absorbing squarylium dye containing 2, 3 -dihydroperimidine end groups exhibited the greatest degree of RSA thus far observed. SCF -CI PPP-MO theory was applied to the theoretical qualitative prediction of the RSA properties of dye chromophores. Theoretical predictions were in good agreement with experimental observations, enabling a distinction to be made between dyes with high or zero RSA activity...|$|R
40|$|Dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSCs) convert {{sunlight}} to electricity {{at a low}} cost. In the DSC, a dye anchored to a mesoporous TiO 2 semiconductor is responsible for capturing the sunlight. The resulting excited dye injects an electron into the conduction band of the TiO 2 and is in turn regenerated by a redox mediator, normally iodide/triiodide, in a surrounding electrolyte. The success of the iodide/triiodide redox couple is mainly attributed to its slow interception of electrons at the TiO 2 surface, which suppresses recombination losses in the DSC. One of the main limitations with the iodide/triiodide redox couple is, however, the large driving force needed for regeneration, which minimizes the open circuit voltage and thus the energy conversion efficiency. In this thesis, alternative redox couples to the iodide/triiodide redox couple have been investigated. These redox couples include the one-electron transition metal complexes, ferrocene and cobalt polypyridine complexes. The use of one-electron redox couples in the DSC has previously been shown to lead to poor photovoltaic performances, because of increased recombination. Cobalt redox couples were here found to give surprisingly high efficiencies {{in combination with the}} triphenylamine-based organic dye, D 35. The success of the D 35 dye, in combination with cobalt redox couples, was mainly attributed to the introduction of steric alkoxy <b>chains</b> on the <b>dye,</b> which supress recombination losses. By introducing steric substituents on the dye, rather than on the redox couple, mass transport limitations could in addition be avoided, which previously has been suggested to limit the performance of cobalt complexes in the DSC. The result of this study formed the basis for the world record efficiency of DSCs of 12. 3 % using cobalt redox couples. Interfacial electron-transfer processes in cobalt-based DSCs were investigated to gain information of advantages and limitations using cobalt redox couples in the DSC. The redox potentials of cobalt redox couples are easily tuned by changing the coordination sphere of the complexes, and regeneration and recombination kinetics were systematically investigated by increasing the redox potential of the cobalt complexes. Our hope is that this thesis can be a guideline for future design of new redox systems in DSCs. ...|$|R

Three adsorbent systems were used depending upon the type of adsorbate. These systems include inorganic system based on activated carbon (AC) and polymer based system including both natural and synthetic polymer. Two types of activated carbons (ACs), fabric and granulated, were used. The granulated activated carbon was further modified using nitric acid and sodium hypochlorite as oxidizing agents, to enhance the oxygenated functional groups on AC. They were well characterized in terms of surface chemistry by â€œBoehmâ€� titrations and pH of point of zero charge measurements and porosity by N 2 adsorption at 77 K and CO 2 adsorption at 273 K. Upon modification, AC contained carboxylic, lectonic, and phenolic typeâ€™s functionality. The adsorptions of ILs on these ACs were studied at different temperatures (25 - 55 Â°C) and pH range. Thermodynamic studies indicated that the adsorption of ILs onto ACs was an exothermic process. Their removal efficiency increased with increase in alkyl chain length, which {{was due to the}} increase in hydrophobicity of long chain ILs cations determined with the evolution of the calculated octanolâ€“water constant (Kow) and negative values of free energies indicated its spontaneous nature. The 2 nd adsorption system used in this work was based on polymer membranes prepared from chitosan (CS). The chitosan was mixed with two different amount of poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) and chemically crosslinked by using a new crosslinking agent i. e. methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS). The crosslinked CS/PVA membranes showed hydrogel properties and swelling was decreased with increase in PVA content. Infrared spectroscopy confirmed the crosslinking reaction between the feed components and the existence of siloxane bond. The membrane swelling was greatly affected by pH, ionic strength and temperature of the solution. These membranes showed high swelling in acidic and low swelling in basic pH range. This switchable pH response of these membranes was exploited and used to adsorb dyes from aqueous solution. The effect of dye concentration, contact time, adsorbent amount and pH on the selectivity and sensitivity of the removal process was investigated. The pH of solution greatly affected the removal efficiency and maximum adsorption was observed at pH 3. Thermodynamic parameters suggested that the dyes adsorption on the membrane was spontaneous and the process was endothermic. The effect of time, pH and salt concentration on swelling were investigated. The high adsorption of dyes in acidic media is very useful because most of textile effluents in acidic pH range and the membranes are quite suitable for such type of system. In 3 rd system, acrylic acid was polymerized by gamma radiations in the presence of phenyltriethoxysilane (PTES). Different amounts of PTES were incorporated in acrylic acid and irradiated at different doses upto maximum of 30 kGy. The crosslinked poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) showed hydrogel properties and adsorb maximum of 246 g. g- 1 of water. The increased PTES concentration decreased the EDS of the PAA hydrogels. Thermogravimetric analysis showed an increase in the stability of the hydrogels having high PTES content. The swelling of the hydrogel affected by pH, ionic strength and temperature. These hydrogels showed low swelling in acidic and basic pH range and high swelling around neutral pH. The adsorption of copper onto these hydrogels was studied. The pH of solution greatly affected the removal efficiency and maximum adsorption was achieved at pH 3. The effect of contact time, dye concentration, adsorbent amount and pH on the selectivity and sensitivity of the removal process was investigated. All the data of ionic liquids, dyes and copper metal were analyzed by applying different kinetics models such as: pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order, models, diffusion law and Boyd law. The equilibrium adsorption capacities of the adsorbent for all adsorbates removal were measured and the experimental data was analyzed by applying adsorption model such as: Langmuir, Freundlich and Langmuir Freundlich isotherm model...|$|R
