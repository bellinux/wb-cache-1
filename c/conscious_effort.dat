5|$|In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal's key {{ally in the}} south, {{switched}} {{allegiance to}} Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence. It appears {{that this was a}} <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> on the part of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset {{the balance of power in}} the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Copán.|$|E
5|$|When Paramount {{announced}} its first slate of DVD releases in August 1998, First Contact {{was one of}} the first ten titles released in October, announced in a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> to showcase effects-driven films. This version contained the feature and two trailers, but no other special features. The film was presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic aspect ratio, with a surround sound Dolby Digital 5.1 audio mix.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{said that}} Spira {{deviates}} from {{the worlds of}} past Final Fantasy games most notably {{in the level of}} detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> to maintain during the design process. Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E

Stations such as Sandy Lodge (now Moor Park) were built to serve golf courses and hunts along the route, and horse-vans were {{provided}} at stations serving hunts and point to points. Two Pullman cars were introduced in 1909 on selected services between the City of London and Chesham, Aylesbury and Verney Junction {{for the benefit of}} businessmen travelling to work and theatregoers returning from London.|$|E
5|$|The 1832 {{exhibition}} of Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude {{figures for the}} rest of his career, he made a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> to try to illustrate moral lessons with his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career. He died in late 1849, and following his death nude paintings went rapidly out of fashion in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Doom 3 {{was also}} {{intended}} to be more storyline focused than previous id titles, as was demonstrated by the developers' <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> to have more professional voice acting. Late in 2002, two employees at ATI Technologies leaked a development version of Doom 3 onto the Internet. One year later, a new trailer was shown at E3 2003 and soon afterwards id Software's website was updated to showcase Doom 3 as an upcoming project, although it was also announced that Doom 3 would not {{be ready for the}} 2003 holiday season. According to John Carmack, the development took longer than expected.|$|E

50|$|The {{revenues}} from coffee exports account for 10% {{of the annual}} government revenue, {{because of the large}} share the industry is given very high priority, but there are <b>conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> by the government to reduce the coffee industry's share of the GDP by increasing the manufacturing sector.|$|R
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E
5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts. Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E
5|$|Love Kraft is {{the seventh}} studio album by Welsh indie rock band Super Furry Animals, {{released}} on 22 August 2005 through Epic Records in the United Kingdom. The album {{was recorded in}} Spain with producer Mario Caldato Jr and {{was something of a}} departure for the band, with all members contributing songs and lead vocals alongside Gruff Rhys who had been main songwriter for the Super Furries until this point. In selecting tracks for Love Kraft a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> was made by the band not to choose songs on their individual merit but rather to pick those which went well together in order to create as cohesive an album as possible. The album's name was taken from a sex shop, Love Craft, near the Cardiff offices of the Super Furries' management team and is also a nod to American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft.|$|E

5|$|While {{the entire}} script {{was still in}} the draft phase, Maeda revised lines that felt unnatural after asking others for their {{opinions}} on it, including Na-Ga. When writing the script, Maeda made a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> to write Charlotte in the framework of an anime series, as opposed to when he wrote the script for Angel Beats!, which he admits he wrote more akin to the framework of a video game. In this way, Toba felt that Charlotte was Maeda's effort to write a story in its purest form that could not be made into a video game, unlike Angel Beats!. Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario, especially the protagonist, and went on to echo Horikawa's sentiment that Charlotte is akin to an I novel for Maeda. Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda's effort to remove the restrictions that come from writing the scenario for a video game.|$|E

25|$|During {{this period}} in history, war rape took place not {{necessarily}} as a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> of war to terrorize the enemy, {{but rather as}} earned compensation for winning a war.
