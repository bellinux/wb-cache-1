The combustion products expand through the two-stage (single-stage on early engines) high-pressure turbine section, which {{is connected to the}} compressor via the HP shaft. The combustion products continue to expand through the two-stage power turbine which generates shaft horsepower for the aircraft. A coaxial stub shaft connects the power turbine to a compact reduction gearbox, located inboard, between the centrifugal compressor and the exhaust/power turbine system. The exhaust stream then turn through 90 degrees to exit the engine in a radial direction through twin exhaust ducts, which form a V-shape in elevation. An important design feature of the Model 250 engine is its modular construction which greatly simplifies maintenance and repair activity. Also the unique reverse-flow design provides for ease of hot section maintenance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTurbocharging {{technology}} {{will play a}} crucial role in the near future as a way to meet the requirements for pollutant emissions and fuel consumption reduction. However, optimal turbocharger control is still an issue, especially for downsized engines fitted with a low number of cylinders. As a matter of fact, automotive turbochargers are characterized by wide operating range and unsteady gas flow through the turbine, while only steady flow maps are usually provided by the manufacturer. In addition, in passenger cars applications, real-time turbocharger optimal control is even more difficult because of the lack of information about pressure/temperature in turbine upstream/downstream circuits and turbocharger rotational speed. In order to overcome these unknowns, this work presents a methodology for instantaneous turbocharger rotational speed determination through a proper processing of the signal coming from one accelerometer mounted on the <b>compressor</b> <b>diffuser,</b> or one microphone facing the compressor. The presented approach can be used to evaluate both turbocharger speed mean value and the amplitude of turbocharger speed fluctuations caused by the pulsating gas flow in turbine upstream and downstream circuits. Once turbocharger speed has been determined, it can be used to estimate power delivered by the turbine. The whole estimation algorithm has been developed and validated for a light duty turbocharged Common-Rail Diesel engine mounted in a test cell. However, the developed methodology is general and can be applied to different turbochargers, both for Spark Ignited and Diesel applications...|$|E

In reverse-tangent injection, a stream or jet of the working fluid (the fluid that is compressed) is injected into the vaneless annular region between the blades of the impeller and the vanes of the diffuser.

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the influence of}} inlet flow conditions, including Mach number, flow angle, blockage, and axial flow non-uniformity, on the performance and operating range of a straight channel centrifugal <b>compressor</b> <b>diffuser.</b> The research {{was carried out in}} a unique facility specifically developed to provide the diffuser with a controlled inlet flow. The tests were carried out for inlet Mach number up to values greater than unity and for a range of inlet flow angles up to the onset of rotating stall. It was found that expressing the overall diffuser pressure recovery coefficient, defined using availability or mass averaged inlet total pressure, as a function of momentum averaged diffuser inlet flow angle yields a relationship which is essentially independent of diffuser inlet flow distortion, blockage, or Mach number. Further, the operating range of the diffuser was limited by the onset of rotating stall at a momentum averaged diffuser inlet flow angle ([alpha]crit = 70. 5 ± 0. 5), which was also independent of the inlet flow field axial distortion and Mach number. The straight channel diffuser was designed to be comparable to a previously tested discrete passage diffuser and the performance of the two was compared; the overall pressure recovery of the former was found to be roughly 10 % higher than that of the latter. Both diffuser types, straight channel and discrete passage diffuser showed similar behavior regarding the insensitivity of the performance and operating range to inlet flow axial non-uniformities and Mach number.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with improving the prediction reliability of CFD modeling of gas turbine combustors. CFD modeling of gas turbine combustors has recently become an important tool in the combustor design process which till now routinely used the old "cut and try " design practice. Improving the prediction capabilities and reliability of CFD methods will reduce the cycle time between idea and a working product. The paper presents a 3 D numerical simulation of the BSE Ltd. YT- 175 engine combustor, a small, annular, reversal flow type combustor. The entire flow field is modeled, from the <b>compressor</b> <b>diffuser</b> to turbine inlet. The model includes the fuel nozzle, the vaporizer solid walls and liner solid walls with the dilution holes and cooling louvers. A periodic 36 ° sector of the combustor is modeled using a hybrid structured/unstructured multi-block grid. The time averaged Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations are solved, using the k-e turbulence model and the Combined Time Scale (COMTIME) /PPDF models for modeling the turbulent kinetic energy reaction rate. The vaporizer and liner walls temperature is predicted by the 'conjugate heat transfer ' methodology, based on simultaneous solution of the heat transfer equations for the vaporizer and liner walls, coupled with the N-S equations for the fluids. The calculated results for the mass flux passing through the vaporizer and various holes and slots of the liner walls, {{as well as the}} jet angle emerging from the liner dilution holes are in very good agreement with experimental measurements. The predicted location of the liner wall hot spots agree well with the position of deformations and cracks that occurred in the liner walls during test runs of the combustor.

The shapes were I-shape, C-shape, S-shape and Disc-shape. The experimental apparatus mainly includes one glass tank, a microporous aeration system and a dissolved oxygen meter. The sizes of the glass tank were 2 m × 0. 8 m × 0. 8 m (length × width × height). The different shapes of air diffuser were fixed {{in the center of}} the tank bottom. The diffused-air flow rate was set among 0. 6 - 1. 8 m 3 /h and the water depth was set of 0. 4 m, 0. 55 m, 0. 7 m. Based on the Standard Test Method for Oxygen from American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the oxygen volumetric mass transfer coefficients were calculated. The results showed that the optimal aeration efficiency is under the use of I-shaped diffuser, and then C-shaped and disc-shaped diffuser, the poorest one is the use of S-shape. When the air-free water surface mass transfer was cut off by covering plastics film on the top of the tank, the oxygen volumetric mass transfer coefficients of I-shaped, C-shaped, S-shaped and disc-shaped diffusers were decreased.

40|$|The stable {{operation}} of centrifugal compressors {{is limited by}} well-known phenomena, rotating stall and surge. Although the manifestation of the full scale instabilities {{is similar to the}} ones observed in axial machines, the stall inception in centrifugal compressors is less well understood. This thesis focuses on developing an integrated methodology to predict the stability limit and the stall inception pattern in highly-loaded centrifugal <b>compressors</b> with vaned <b>diffusers.</b> The approach, based on a body force representation of the blade rows, is different from previous research in that the prediction is independent of compressor stability correlations and a-priori knowledge of the compressor characteristics. The methodology consists of a control volume analysis to define the body force fields based on steady, single-passage 3 -D RANS simulations and a look-up table approach to capture the dependence of the body forces on the local flow parameters. The body force model was implemented in a finite volume scheme of an existing unsteady Euler solver for a full-wheel domain consisting of only 68, 000 cells. The body force based compressor model was validated against high-fidelity 3 -D RANS calculations and was applied to investigate the stall inception in a pre-production, 5. 0 pressure ratio, high-speed centrifugal compressor stage of advanced design. The body force based simulation at 75 % corrected design speed agreed with experimental measurements available at design speed in that the diffuser becomes unstable at operating points with a positively sloped diffuser static pressure rise characteristic. (cont.) Modal stall precursors were observed and the backward-traveling character of the long-wavelength disturbance was found to be in agreement with predictions by a previously developed analytical centrifugal compressor stability model and experimental measurements in the same compressor. Additional investigations in a compressor with altered dynamic behavior demonstrated the capability of the body force-based compressor model to capture the formation of shortwavelength spike-like stall precursors. It {{is the first time that}} both backward-traveling modal waves and short-wavelength spike-like stall precursors are simulated in a centrifugal <b>compressor</b> with vaned <b>diffuser,</b> in agreement with experimental measurements.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to compare the effects of two different diffuser vane geometries on the performance of a centrifugal <b>compressor.</b> Vaned <b>diffusers</b> are commonly used in aeroengines because they can achieve higher pressure recoveries than vaneless diffusers of similar size. Improving the diffuser’s pressure recovery and effectiveness can result in overall compressor performance benefits that are sought out by engine manufacturers looking to improve overall engine efficiency. An airfoil vane was tested and compared to a baseline wedge diffuser in the Purdue CSTAR research facility, where the centrifugal compressor used for this study is intended to be the last stage of an axial-centrifugal compressor. ^ The overall stage performance for the compressor with the airfoil diffuser was first obtained at open impeller tip clearances and then at tight clearances. In the tight clearance configuration, the compressor consistently had higher total pressure ratio and higher isentropic efficiency compared to the open clearance configuration. In particular, impeller isentropic efficiency and shroud static pressure along the entire impeller passage were highest at the tight impeller clearance configuration, indicating less losses due to tip leakage flow. The reduction in tip leakage flow, and resulting blockage, at tight clearance operation was also suggested by the increase in choke mass flow rate for all corrected speeds. ^ For the comparison of the airfoil and wedge diffuser assemblies, data were acquired with the impeller in the tight clearance configuration. Despite slight differences in exducer tip clearances (less than 2 x 10 - 3 in.), stage total pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency at 100 % corrected speed were not significantly different between the two diffuser assemblies. Upon closer inspection of individual components, the airfoil diffuser actually had, on average, higher pressure recovery and higher diffuser effectiveness than the wedge diffuser. However, the airfoil diffuser assembly had higher losses in the deswirl region compared to the wedge diffuser assembly. Excluding measurements from the deswirl, the total pressure ratio for the airfoil diffuser assembly was slightly greater than that of the wedge diffuser assembly. A physical mismatch in the airfoil diffuser and deswirl assembly could be responsible for the losses recorded in the deswirl region and could have resulted in the limited performance improvements observed. Additionally, the similar vane geometries at the leading edge (in terms of inlet metal angle and thickness) combined with any deviation from design during manufacturing could have limited the predicted performance benefits. ...|$|R
40|$|To reduce {{vibration}} {{and noise}} level, the impeller and diffuser blade numbers inside an industrial compressor are typically chosen without common divisors. The shapes of volutes or collectors in these compressors are also not axis-symmetric.

To obtain a fundamental physical understanding of these three-dimensional unsteady flow fields and assess {{their impact on the}} compressor performance, the flow field inside the compressors needs to be studied as a whole to include asymmetric and unsteady interaction between the compressor components. In the current study, a unified three-dimensional numerical model was built for a transonic centrifugal <b>compressor</b> including impeller, <b>diffusers,</b> and volute. HFC 134 a was used as the working fluid. The thermodynamic and transport properties of the refrigerant gas were modeled by the Martin-Hou equation of state and power laws, respectively.

Physically based preliminary design tools are desirable for parametric studies early in the design stage, and to provide deep physical insight and {{a good starting point}} for the later CFD analyses. Four analytical/semi-analytical models are developed in this study: 1) a generalized flat plate cascade model for investigating the unsteady aerodynamics of a blade row with non-uniformly spaced blades; 2) a multistage interaction model for investigating rotor-stator interactions; 3) an analytical solution for quantifying the impeller wake convection and pressure wave propagating between a centrifugal <b>compressor</b> impeller and <b>diffuser</b> vane; and 4) a semi-analytical model based Lifting line theory for unified propeller and horizontal-axis turbine optimization. Each model has been thoroughly validated with existing models. ^ With these models, non-uniformly spaced blade rows and vane clocking are investigated in detail for their potential use as a passive control technique to reduce forced response, flutter and aeroacoustic problems in axial compressors. Parametric studies with different impeller blade numbers and back sweep angles are conducted to investigate their effect on impeller wake and pressure wave propagation. Results show that the scattered pressure waves with high circumferential wave numbers may be an important excitation source to the impeller as their amplitude grows much faster as they travel inwardly than the lower order primary pressure waves. Detailed analysis of Lifting line theory reveals the mathematical and physical equivalence of Lifting line models for propellers and horizontal-axis turbines. With a new implementation, the propeller optimization code can be used for horizontal-axis turbine optimization without any modification. The newly developed unified propeller and horizontal-axis turbine optimization code based on lifting line theory and interior point method {{has been shown to be}} a very versatile tool with the capability of hub modelling, working with non-uniform inflow and including extra user specified constraints. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{interrogation of}} the time-averaged and time-unsteady flow fields of two centrifugal compressors of nearly identical design (the enhanced, which encountered aeromechanical difficulty, and production, {{which did not}} encounter any such difficulty) is undertaken {{in an effort to}} establish a causal link between impeller-diffuser interactions and the forced response behavior of the impeller blades. Through comparison of time- averaged flow variable and performance estimates with test rig data, the three- dimensional, unsteady, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes flow solver (MSU Turbo) used in this interrogation is found to be adequate to the task of distinguishing the flow fields of the two centrifugal compressor designs. Thus, it is found that MSU Turbo can be a useful tool in comparing the unsteady flow fields in different centrifugal compressors. In addition, through comparisons of MSU Turbo/ ANSYS® estimates of strain with measured peak strain, MSU Turbo is also found to have the potential, as part of a CFD/ ANSYS® system, for serving as a predictive tool for forced response behavior in centrifugal compressors. Differences are found in the unsteady flow fields of the two compressors. The fluctuations over time of the unsteady blade loading on the enhanced impeller blades are greater than those on the production impeller blades. In the vaneless space, on each annular plane (from the impeller exit to the diffuser inlet), at a given spanwise location, the enhanced compressor has both a greater spatial variation in pressure and a higher average static pressure than the production <b>compressor.</b> At the <b>diffuser</b> inlet, there are differences in the time-averaged incidence angle distributions of the two compressors. (cont.) Based on the observations delineated above, it is hypothesized that the differences in the time-averaged incidence angle distributions are the source of the differences in the pressure field that propagates upstream into the impeller passage, where these differences affect the unsteady blade loading. The differences in the unsteady blade loading then lead to the observed forced response behavior in the two designs. by Caitlin J. Smythe. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Fossil fuels are non-renewable {{resources}} {{which take}} {{millions of years}} to form, and whose reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being generated. Furthermore, fossil fuels utilization raises environmental concerns, particularly regarding the global climate change,while the increasing price trend indicates that the fossil-fuels-based energy is becoming a scarce commodity. Therefore, the current energy situation cannot be maintained indefinitely and future energy conversion systems have to be sustainable. One of the options for a more efficient and sustainable use of fossil fuels as energy sources is arguably distributed generation (DG). Among the various technologies which are currently proposed for DG, micro {{combined heat and power}} (microCHP), defined as the process of producing both electricity and usable thermal energy at high efficiency and near the point of use, could play a very relevant role, because it positively integrates technological as well as cultural and institutional components, related to the potential for reducing the ecological impact of electricity conversion. Micro gas turbines offer many potential advantages in comparison to other conversion technologies suitable for microCHP applications, such as compact size and high specific power; small number of moving parts; low vibrations and noise; low maintenance requirements, which lead to low maintenance costs; high fuel flexibility; possibly short delivery time and very low emissions; modularity; high-grade residual thermal energy. The main components of a CHP unit based on a micro turbine are the compressor, the turbine, the combustor, the recuperator, the generator, and the heat recovery unit. In the size range of micro gas turbines, radial-flow components are usually adopted for the turbomachinery, since they offer minimum surface and end-wall losses, and provide the highest efficiency. Centrifugal compressors also provide very high pressure ratio per stage, are less expensive to manufacture, and are similar in terms of design and volume flow rate to those adopted for automotive turbochargers, whose market is currently around two millions units per year, and is therefore characterized by relatively low production costs. The use of single-shaft radial turbomachinery for micro turbines allows thus for simple designs, with satisfiying aerothermodynamic and economic constraints, thanks to the evolution that automotive turbochargers have experienced in the past seventy years. Furthermore, the introduction of advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools and of innovative materials in recent years has led to a marked improvement in the current state-of-the-art technology of small turbochargers. However, according to some authors, the efficiency levels of centrifugal compressors have almost "stalled" after years of development, while further improvements by means of CFD methodologies would likely to be only incremental. Nevertheless, improvements in micro turbines performance through suitable modifications of turbocharger technology are to be expected, especially considering that turbochargers usually employ centrifugal <b>compressors</b> with vaneless <b>diffusers</b> in order to maximize the flow range and minimize production costs, wherelse gas turbines require higher efficiency and pressure ratio for a much narrower operating range. Moreover, further engineering challenges are related to the so-called small-scale effects. These are due to i) relatively high viscous losses because of low Reynolds numbers; ii) high relative tip clearance (i. e., the ratio of the tip clearance to the blade height at the impeller outlet) due to manufacturing tolerances; iii) high heat losses, because of large area-to-volume ratios; iv) relative large size-independent losses, such as those from bearings and auxiliaries, given the low power output. As a consequence, the main objectives of this work are 1. To develop novel methodologies which allow understanding the flow structure and loss mechanisms of very small centrifugal compressors, and identifying those aspects whose improvement can lead to higher micro compressor performance. 2. To analyze and quantify the influence of the tip clearance on the performance and flow properties of micro compressors, since the unshrouded impellers used in automotive turbochargers suffer from efficiency decrements, because of the pressure losses and secondary flows caused by very large clearance gaps. 3. To design and build a test-rig for the automatic acquisition of the performance maps of very small centrifugal compressors, and for testing either future, new configurations which aim to improve the performance of an exemplary micro turbine compressor, or other very small centrifugal compressors. 4. To develop an original optimization methodology for turbomachinery components, to be further utilized for the improvement of the performance of an exemplary micro turbine compressor, through the investigation of vaned diffusers, which are claimed to exhibit higher static pressure recovery and efficiency than vaneless diffusers, at the expenses of a narrower operating range. In this study, the recuperated micro gas turbine developed by the Dutch company Micro Turbine Technology B. V. (MTT) has been utilized as an illustrative example. The MTT micro turbine delivers electrical and thermal power output up to 3 and 14 kW, respectively, and will be primarily applied in microCHP units for domestic dwellings. The turbomachinery consists of a commercial off-the-shelf automotive turbocharger, made of a centrifugal compressor, a radial turbine, and oil-lubricated bearings. A cycle study of the MTT recuperated micro gas turbine has been carried out in order {{to assess the impact of}} the centrifugal compressor performance on the system performance. The analysis proved that increasing the performance of the centrifugal compressor adopted for the MTT micro turbine is pivotal in order to achieve higher performance levels of the microCHP system. The main conclusions of the work presented here are summarized as follows: 1. A fully automated optimization methodology has been developed by integrating an optimization algorithm, a geometry generator, a grid generator, a CFD solver, and a post processor. This methodology can be used for the optimization of turbomachinery components, but has been applied here to the design and optimization of vaned diffusers for the exemplarymicro compressor. The optimized vaned diffusers led to increased static pressure recovery, but the compressor efficiency was lower than that of the vaneless configuration, because of larger total pressure losses. 2. The test-rig, which has been designed and built for the automatic acquisition of the performancemaps of very small, high-speed centrifugal compressors, proved to be robust, reliable, and versatile. An experimental campaign has been carried out in order to quantify the aerodynamic performance of the exemplary compressor, and the test data, summarized in the form of performance maps and tables, have been used to validate the results of the numerical analyses shown in this dissertation. Furthermore, the test-rig will be a useful tool in the development of future, new designs which aim at improving the performance of the exemplary micro turbine compressor, and will be utilized to test other very small centrifugal compressors for a variety of different applications. 3. A new one-dimensional (1 D) method for the assessment of the performance (i. e., stage total-to-total pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency; impeller inlet and outlet velocity triangles; impeller internal, external, and mixing losses; vaneless diffuser losses; volute losses) of very small centrifugal compressors has been developed on the basis of two very well-known design methodologies, namely the single- and two-zone model. This novel tool combines the advantages of the two, since it distinguishes between high- and low-momentum flows within the impeller bladed passages as possible with the two-zone model, and allows evaluating the impeller loss mechanisms, as possible with the single-zone model. This dissertation is structured as follows. Chapter 1 illustrates the concept, potential, and technology of microCHP within the framework of different energy scenarios. The motivation and scope of this work, and the outline of the dissertation are also given here. Chapter 2 presents the new 1 D method for the assessment of the performance and loss mechanisms of very small centrifugal compressors. The novel methodology has been applied here to the exemplary micro centrifugal compressor. The numerical results computed by this tool have been validated against the experimental results obtained with the test-rig. The comparison has been performed at 190 and 220 krpm, and varying mass flow rate, respectively, and shows a good agreement, since the model is able to capture the pressure ratio and efficiency trends. However, in proximity of the choking condition the difference between the numerical and test data is higher. Furthermore, at the micro turbine design point (i. e., mass flow rate equal to 50 g/s and rotational speed equal to 240 krpm), the model overpredicts the pressure ratio, but underpredicts the efficiency. At the micro turbine design point, it has been calculated that the skin friction losses contribute to the largest efficiency decrease, followed by the mixing losses, and the vaneless diffuser losses. Chapter 3 describes the experimental set-up which has been designed and built for the acquisition of the performance maps of very small, high-speed centrifugal compressors. The compressor impeller is driven by a turbine powered by pressurized air coming from a buffer tank, pressurized in turn by two screw compressors. The shaft speed is varied by a turbine control valve, while further equipment necessary to operate the test-rig was also integrated into the set-up, as well as the instrumentation and data|$|R
