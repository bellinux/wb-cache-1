50|$|A {{standard}} problem in using crossbar switches {{is that of}} setting the <b>crosspoints.</b> In the classic telephony application of crossbars, the <b>crosspoints</b> are closed, and open as the telephone calls come and go. In Asynchronous Transfer Mode or packet switching applications, the <b>crosspoints</b> must be made and broken at each decision interval. In high-speed switches, the settings {{of all of the}} <b>crosspoints</b> must be determined and then set millions or billions of times per second. One approach for making these decisions quickly is {{through the use of a}} wavefront arbiter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Combined input-crosspoint {{buffered}} (CICB) {{packet switches}} with dedicated <b>crosspoint</b> buffers require a {{minimum amount of}} memory in the buffered crossbar of N 2 × k × L, where N {{is the number of}} ports and k is the <b>crosspoint</b> buffer size, which is defined by the distance between the line cards and the buffered crossbar, to achieve 100 % throughput under highspeed data flows. A long distance between these two components can make a buffered crossbar costly to implement. In this paper, we study a shared-memory <b>crosspoint</b> buffered packet switch that uses small <b>crosspoint</b> buffers and no speedup to support differentiated services and long distances between the line cards and the buffered crossbar in practical implementations.

The largest full access matrix switches in the system, however, were 8x8 rather than 10x10 or 20x16. Thus they required eight stages rather than four to achieve large enough junctor groups in a large office. <b>Crosspoints</b> being more expensive in the new system but switches cheaper, system cost was minimized with fewer <b>crosspoints</b> organized into more switches. The fabric was divided into Line Networks and Trunk Networks of four stages, and partially folded to allow connecting line-to-line or trunk-to-trunk without exceeding eight stages of switching.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Buffered {{crossbar}} switches {{are special}} crossbar switches with an exclusive buffer at each <b>crosspoint.</b> They demon-strate unique advantages over traditional unbuffered crossbar switches, such as asynchronous scheduling and variable length packet handling. However, since <b>crosspoint</b> buffers are expen-sive on-chip memories, it is desired that each <b>crosspoint</b> {{has only a}} small buffer. In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm called Fair Asynchronous Segment Scheduling (FASS) for buffered crossbar switches, which reduces the <b>crosspoint</b> buffer size by dividing packets into shorter segments before transmission. FASS also provides tight constant performance guarantees by emulating the ideal Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) model. Furthermore, FASS requires no speedup for the crossbar, lowering the hardware cost and improving the switch capacity. By theoretical analysis, we prove that FASS is strongly stable and therefore achieves 100 % throughput. We also calculate the size bound for the <b>crosspoint</b> buffers and the reassembly buffers at output ports. Moreover, we show that FASS provides bounded delay guarantees. Finally, we present simulation data to verify the analytical results. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of Internet routers is greatly {{defined by the}} adopted switch architecture. Combined input-crosspoint buffered (CICB) packet switches are being considered of research interest because of their high switching performance. One of the main requirements in these switches is {{that the amount of}} memory needed to achieve 100 % throughput under flows with high data rates must be proportional to the number of ports and <b>crosspoint</b> buffer size, which is set by the distance between the line cards and the buffered crossbar. Therefore, long distances between the line cards and the buffered crossbar can make a CICB switch costly to implement or infeasible. In this paper, we propose and discuss two CICB packet switches with flexible access to <b>crosspoint</b> buffers. The proposed switches allow an input to use any available <b>crosspoint</b> buffer at a given output, instead of having rigid access where an input can only access a dedicated <b>crosspoint</b> buffer at a given output, as is the case on previous existing architectures. The proposed switches provide high switching performance and support long distances between the buffered crossbar and the line cards, while using <b>crosspoint</b> buffers of small size. Our switches reduce the required <b>crosspoint</b> buffer size by a factor of N, where N is the number of ports, keep service of cells in sequence, and use no speedup...|$|R

50|$|In {{the field}} of telecommunications, a Clos network {{is a kind of}} {{multistage}} circuit switching network, first formalized by Charles Clos in 1952, which represents a theoretical idealization of practical multi-stage telephone switching systems. Clos networks are required when the physical circuit switching needs to exceed the capacity of the largest feasible single crossbar switch. The key advantage of Clos networks is that the number of <b>crosspoints</b> (which make up each crossbar switch) required can be far fewer than would be the case if the entire switching system were implemented with one large crossbar switch. When the Clos network was first devised, the number of <b>crosspoints</b> was a reasonable approximate indication of the total cost of the switching system. While this was important for electromechanical crossbars, it became less relevant with the advent of VLSI, wherein the interconnects often could be implemented either directly in silicon, or within a relatively small cluster of boards. However, the advent of complex data centers, with huge interconnect structures, each based on optical fiber links, means that they are again important.|$|E
