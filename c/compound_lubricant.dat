Our study is the first reporting quantitative data about the molecular weight (MW) forms of HA, lubricin, and PLs in SF from cohorts of healthy donors, patients with early (eOA) - or late (lOA) -stage osteoarthritis (OA), and patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: We used human SF from unaffected controls, eOA, lOA, and RA. HA and lubricin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PLs was quantified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Fatty acids (FAs) were analyzed by gas chromatography, coupled with mass spectrometry. The MW distribution of HA was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Results: Compared with control SF, the concentrations of HA and lubricin were lower in OA and RA SF, whereas those of PLs were higher in OA and RA SF. Moreover, the MW distribution of HA shifted toward the lower ranges in OA and RA SF. We noted distinct alterations between cohorts in the relative distribution of PLs {{and the degree of}} FA saturation and chain lengths of FAs. Conclusions: The levels, composition, and MW distribution of all currently known lubricants in SFHA, lubricin, PLsvary with joint disease and stage of OA.

The atmospheric lifetime of this fluorinated alcohol with respect to reaction with OH is around 11 days and hence its contribution to radiative forcing will be small.

We have used a combination of chloroplast and nuclear genetic markers to investigate the closest extant relatives of the original maternal progenitors of B. napus. This was based on a comprehensive sampling of the relevant genepools, including 83 accessions of A genome B. rapa L. (both wild and cultivated types), 94 accessions of B. napus and 181 accessions of C genome wild and cultivated B. oleracea L. and related species. Results Three chloroplast haplotypes occurred in B. napus. The most prevalent haplotype (found in 79 % of accessions) was not present within the C genome accessions but was found at low frequencies in B. rapa. Chloroplast haplotypes characteristic of B. napus were found in a small number of wild and weedy B. rapa populations, and also in two accessions of cultivated B. rapa 'brocoletto'. Whilst introgression of the B. napus chloroplast type in the wild and weedy B. rapa populations has been proposed by other studies, the presence of this haplotype within the two brocoletto accessions is unexplained. Conclusions The distribution of chloroplast haplotypes eliminate any of the C genome species as being the maternal ancestor {{of the majority of the}} B. napus accessions. The presence of multiple chloroplast haplotypes in B. napus and B. rapa accessions was not correlated with nuclear genetic diversity as determined by AFLPs, indicating that such accessions do not represent recent hybrids. Whilst some chloroplast diversity observed within B. napus can be explained by introgression from inter-specific crosses made during crop improvement programmes, there is evidence that the original hybridisation event resulting in to B. napus occurred on more than one occasion, and involved different maternal genotypes. </p...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedPetroleum is an {{essential}} natural resource used {{as the source of}} energy and raw material for almost all industries. It is also a non-renewable resource and not easily accessible in most cases. Today, as the global petroleum reserves are becoming increasingly scarce due to the rapid industrialization, the price of petroleum and products used petroleum as base materials will inevitably escalate and negatively impact on our economy. Moreover, the environmental impacts associated with petroleum exploration have increasingly become critical issues of global concern. In order to conserve petroleum resource and reduce petroleum drilling, the regeneration of petroleum-based materials for beneficial reuse and the utilization of renewable resources as base materials to substitute petroleum are two necessary actions toward a sustainable earth.; Lubricants, either mineral-based or synthetic made, are the products derived from petroleum and developed through tribological research. Lubricants are essential elements for modern industries to perform not only for lubrication of moving parts in machines, engines, and vehicles; but also for many other functions, such as cooling, noise and vibration reduction, cleaning, corrosion protection, and power transfer.; However, lubricants require change after long service because the various impurities generated from the operation may degrade the efficiency of lubricants and significantly contaminate lubricants. Each year over two billion gallons of used lubricants are generated around the world and expected to generate more due to worldwide increased demand in lubricants.; Many studies have confirmed that used petroleum-based lubricants collected from oil-change are slow in degradation and highly toxic to human health, fauna, and flora. Because the disposal of used lubricants is becoming a global concern, it is important to study the potential impacts of used lubricants on human health, animals, plants, and the environment in order to raise public awareness for proper handling in order to prevent them being released to the environment.; On the other hand, used lubricant also contains a significant amount of heating value. Hydrocarbon <b>compounds</b> in used <b>lubricants</b> can be regenerated into either lubricant base materials or an energy source. The regeneration of used lubricants has enormous benefits, including minimizing hazards, reducing waste, protecting the environment, conserving natural resources, and creating an energy source as the energy shortage is becoming a global problem.; The mission of this research is to (1) help the world to reduce used lubricants by regenerating them into an economically competitive energy resource through a sustainable technology and to (2) evaluate and promote the utilization of renewable source, such as plant oils, as green alternatives in lubricant applications. Both are essential to creating a sustainable earth as the ultimate goal of this research.; The binary solvent process, the binary system matrix, and the Cold-Stage Energy Conversion (CSEC) system are the newly developed technologies and products during this four-year research endeavor. The engineering approach and the supporting concepts are presented along with the development of the process and products in this dissertation.; The potential of the binary solvent process in used lubricants purification and hydrocarbon compounds recovery is discussed and reviewed. It has been demonstrated to be a promising technology capable of removing up to 93 % of impurities while recovering up to 99 % of hydrocarbon compounds from various types of used lubricants under atmospheric pressure and at a relatively low temperature. Moreover, environmental sustainability and economic feasibility are two significant designs in this process. All reagents used for this process can be recycled and reused indefinitely.; The binary system matrix is an analytical method designed to enhance the efficiency of the binary solvent process. CSEC system is built based on the concept of binary solvent process and capable of regenerating used lubricants in a continuous-flow fashion at relatively low temperature operated under atmospheric pressure. All these advantages lead to cost saving on less maintenance and easy to handle.; The benefits of new generation of lubricants made from the renewable resources is reviewed and discussed. This dissertation focus on the research of using plant oils as lubricant feedstock. The compositions of different plant oil are unique, many factors, such as climate, soil, and season, have played major contributing roles in the difference. Balancing the resources and the industrial use offers a major challenge in sustainable resource management. The adaptive management is becoming the key to achieving this balance. The use of animal fats or grease as lubricant base materials is no longer practical due to undesirable properties of most animal fats and the concern of society regarding animal welfare issues.; As the concern about the environment compatibility of petroleum-based lubricant is on the rise, lubricants made from plant oils are easily biodegradable; renewable and genetically changeable; less hazardous to human health, fauna, and flora; more stable with temperature change; and safer to use.; In the end, this dissertation presents the recommendations for the future improvements in CSEC system as well as the plans towards the future development of biodegradable lubricants derived from sources that do not compete with food sources, such as ocean phytoplankton or biomass waste...|$|R
