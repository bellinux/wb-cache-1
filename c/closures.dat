40|$|While {{attempting}} to avoid <b>closure,</b> {{it can be}} argued that two of the analytical techniques employed by Lawson (1997) strongly imply <b>closure.</b> First, while ostensibly directed at liberating analysis from all forms of <b>closure,</b> the demi-reg is shown to effectively rely on implied <b>closure.</b> Second, when the use of control groups is compared to Maki's method of isolation, it can be shown that Lawson implies substantially similar <b>closure</b> to that which is proposed by Maki. Such implied forms of <b>closure</b> generally indicate that the complete exclusion of <b>closure</b> remains somewhat problematic.

People high in need for <b>closure</b> seek to avoid this ambiguity at all costs where people high in need to avoid <b>closure</b> strive to make situations more ambiguous.
