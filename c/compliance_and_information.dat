30|$|Despite {{the very}} {{attractive}} features that Cloud promises, {{the rate of}} migration to Cloud is rather slow, mainly due to the inherent security challenges associated with the technology. These challenges include data privacy, transparency, risk management, <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> security (Fox et al. [2009]; Jansen [2011]; Subashini and Kavitha [2011]). Consequently, the security of Cloud paradigm has become a hot research area, which is being explored by both academic and industrial research communities. In this regard, {{issues related to the}} handling and management of sensitive identity credentials have garnered a lot of interest amongst the research communities (Albeshri and Caelli [2010]; Chen and Zhao [2012]; Gunjan et al. [2012]). Storage and processing of identity information by a third party (CSP), outside the organizational boundary, brings in loss of control and transparency issues.

These conflicts reflect individual aspects, which contradict ISA programs’ efforts and hence affect employees’ compliant information security behavior. Empirically, we utilized an embedded multiple case design to investigate three units of analysis, three banks from Central and Eastern Europe. We conducted in total 37 semi-structured interviews with employees in the mentioned case banks. From a practical perspective, {{a better understanding of the}} processes on how awareness programs are managed, might provide some insights to build upon for improving ISA programs in dealing with IS risks and threats. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the consideration of how internal and external factors context in managing ISA programs matter for research and practice. Moreover, the study highlights specific characteristics of ISA programs such as the use of role models or involvement through participation. The research appeals for a more granulated stakeholder concept in ISA programs, which decomposes tense relationships and conflicts...|$|E

40|$|Dynamic traffic {{simulation}} models are frequently {{used to support}} decisions when planning an evacuation. This paper focuses on limitations in the modelling of travellers’ behaviour with respect to traffic information and compliance to evacuation instructions. More specifically, we propose a model framework where the traffic simulation is executed only once (instead of many times within an iterative traffic flow convergence framework, e. g., yielding a user-equilibrium assignment). Within this one-time execution of the traffic simulation (or dynamic network loading procedure), travellers are initially assigned to their instructed route (and destination), yet may continuously update their destination and route during their trip – while accounting for the possibly disutility associated with non compliance – thereby responding to the changing (traffic) conditions (but not anticipating these conditions, as otherwise assumed by an iterative userequilibrium assignment). This way, the realized departure time, destination and route decisions {{are a result of}} the trade-off that travellers make between complying with the prescribed travel behaviour and following their preferred travel behaviour (i. e., the travel decisions that would have been made in absence of an active evacuation plan). Also, this approach allows modelling full compliance, no compliance, and any state in between. The face-validity of the model characteristics are illustrated using a hypothetical test example. The results show the importance of capturing <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> levels in the traffic simulation model, as they have a large impact upon the evacuation efficiency.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} law, reason and emotion {{in the light of}} recent changes in the field of social and online activism, particularly with regard to social interactions within digital networks. With the consolidation of the Internet, freedom of expression gave rise to several social phenomena throughout the world, from the Arab Spring uprisings in Africa and in the Middle East, to Wall Street protesters occupying parks in New York City. Internet tools and social platforms have been enabling an array of forms of social mobilization. Under contemporary law, digital interactions decreased the distance between users and information, allowing citizens to better claim rights, organize protests, express political views and identify peers with similar interests online. However, it also hampered the establishment of traditional face-to-face social relations, raising the awareness of the importance of transparency, <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> mechanisms related to the origin of online posts and online profiles. In many jurisdictions, legal mechanisms have been put into force to make more stringent liability rules, condemn users, take down webpages and remove allegedly offensive content. In different trends, online activism can be purported as wrongful and even criminalized, whereby digital freedom is considerably restricted. Such governmental stance can bring about the derangement of civil liberties and freedom of speech. In an evergrowing online community, it is particularly relevant for Internet users to be able to express themselves freely and to have their civil rights assured in digital environment. In view of that broader spectrum, the paper discusses the urgent needs for legal institutions and the Internet community to gather efforts {{in order to ensure that}} freedoms and users rights are properly safeguarded. What is the proper legal framework for protection of online users interests? Would it foster development, freedom of speech and democratic values? What is the role played by law under the aegis of the world wide web and contemporary society at a national, regional and global level...|$|E
40|$|Revenue losses due to tax {{non-compliance}} pose {{a substantial}} risk for all governments, including the South African government. As {{part of its}} risk management system, the South African Revenue Service has identified the small, medium and micro enterprise sector {{as one of the}} seven high-risk areas and indicated that non-compliance in this sector remains high. The first focus area of any tax compliance risk management system is to ensure registration for the relevant taxes payable. The objective {{of this study was to}} establish whether any demographic factors could be used to select small businesses to investigate whether they are meeting their registration compliance requirements for income tax, Value-Added tax as well as the employee related taxes. In order to achieve the research objectives of the study, two sequential research methods were applied. During the first phase of the research, a literature review was conducted to develop a heuristic model consisting of two levels. The first level described the factors that could influence the tax compliance behaviour of a small business. The second level of the heuristic model describes the different taxes a small business could be liable for and when it must register for each of those taxes. During the second phase, the variables influencing registration compliance were statistically analysed for each of the taxes to determine if they significantly influence the compliance status. The study found that several factors have an impact on the registration compliance of small businesses. The demographic factors were analysed separately for each of the three different tax groups used in the study. The results indicate that in the majority of cases all three tax groups share the same demographic factors that would either have a positive or negative impact on the compliance of the entity. Profiles for the most compliant business type (per tax type) and the least compliant business type (per tax type) were compiled. The results of the study can be used by the South African Revenue Service to target their <b>compliance</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> actions to help improve registration compliance by small businesses.

This <b>information</b> normally contained within documents (e. g. specifications, plans) is contained in an electronic database that allows the project team members to access, query, and status the requirements, verification, <b>and</b> <b>compliance</b> <b>information</b> from their individual desktop computers. Using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) database software that contains networking capabilities, the RVC was developed not only with cost savings in mind but primarily for the purpose of providing a more efficient and effective automated method of maintaining and distributing the systems engineering information. In addition, the RVC approach provides the systems engineer the capability to develop and tailor various reports containing the requirements, verification, <b>and</b> <b>compliance</b> <b>information</b> that meets the needs of the project team members.
