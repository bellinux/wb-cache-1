40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2004 In the Dordogne {{region of}} southwestern France, a {{broadening}} {{of the diet}} {{is known to have}} occurred {{toward the end of the}} Pleistocene, with diets heavily dependent on large ungulates being replaced by those heavily dependent on smaller species, and in particular on the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). There are two main hypotheses explaining this phenomenon: first, that climate change negatively impacted large mammal populations, thus forcing humans to begin incorporating smaller vertebrate species into their diets; and second, that humans themselves negatively impacted large mammal populations, which in turn forced humans to add smaller species to their diets. In this region, however, these hypotheses are complicated by the biogeographical history of Oryctolagus cuniculus. Since this species was present in only very small numbers in the Perigord prior to about 13, 000 years ago, its increasing presence in archaeological faunas after this time may merely reflect its abundance on the landscape. In the research presented here, I use data from two sites in the Perigord [...] -Moulin du Roc (Detrain et al. 1996) and Pont d'Ambon (<b>Celerier</b> 1998; <b>Celerier</b> et al. 1993, 1994) [...] -to explore questions of how and why diets broadened at this time and in this place. I explore the two dominant hypotheses, but also consider two others: first, that the European Rabbit was not, in fact, a lower-ranked prey type; and second, that the Magdalenian was not (as is popularly believed) an "age of plenty. ...|$|R

Information from {{borehole}} measurements (Townend and Zoback 2001), earthquake focal mechanisms (<b>Célérier</b> 2008), and palaeostress inversions (Lisle et al. 2006) {{demonstrates that}} ‘Andersonian’ stress states (one principal stress vertical {{and the other}} two horizontal) prevail over large areas of continental and oceanic crust (Zoback 1992). These ‘Andersonian’ stress orientations provide useful reference states for general consideration, though significant departures undoubtedly occur. For example, although a subduction interface shear zone (SISZ) is, in essence, a large-scale thrust fault accommodating underthrusting of oceanic lithosphere, significant departures from vertical and horizontal stress trajectories are expected from: (1) the kinematic control exerted by a weak plate boundary shear zone; (2) force balance analyses associated with a tapering accretionary wedge (e.g. Dahlen 1990); and (3) time variations in the stress field as a consequence of stress cycling associated with intermittent megathrust rupturing along the SISZ (Hasegawa et al. 2012).|$|R
