40|$|ABSTRACT Antiviral {{interferon}} {{activity in}} any one species can be exhibited {{by a variety of}} substances that differ in their physical and chemical properties, but the nature of these differences is not understood. Conditions that can lead to the formation of diverse types of interferons have been outlined. Reasons have been adduced why, for certain purposes, purification of interferons is desirable or even necessary, and examples have been presented to show how and to what extent this has been achieved. In spite of some very high purification factors, not a single interferon has been obtained as a pure substance. There-fore, all available knowledge of physical and chemical properties has been ob-tained by indirect means. The first interferon was discovered by Isaacs and Lindenmann (1) in 1957, and since then many biochemists have attempted to purify many interferons. It is perhaps worthwhile to pause for a moment and consider why it is sometimes necessary, or at least desirable, to work with purified rather than with <b>crude</b> <b>interferons.</b> WHY PURIFY INTERFERONS? Experiments with <b>crude</b> <b>interferons</b> have on several occasions led to wrong interpretations, and examples that show how this danger was sometimes over-come by purification or other means are presented. There are at least five situations where the use of <b>crude</b> <b>interferons</b> is inappropriate. Firstly, <b>crude</b> <b>interferons,</b> but also sera and tissue extracts from apparently normal animals, culture fluids from uninfected cells, urine, allantoic fluid, egg white, agar overlays, etc., frequently contain other often nonvirus- and nonspecies-specific antiviral substances that may simulate certain aspects of interferon action and may thus mislead the casual observer. A number of specific and nonspecific viral antagonists of this nature is shown in Table I which represents the "list of contents " of a recent'review article by Wasser-mann (2). But there are doubtless others, e. g. Buckler and Baron (3) showed that heterologous, acid-stable, antivaccinia virus activity of crude mouse 113...|$|R

Polymerase activity was low in interferon-treated infected cells, but this did not result from the presence of enzyme inhibitors in the preparations.

40|$|Mouse {{interferon}} mRNA, {{extracted from}} NDV (Newcastle disease virus) -induced L- 929 cells has been translated with high efficiency in Xenopus laevis oocytes and rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The translational efficiency of a crude RNA extract was 10 640 interferon units/mg RNA/hour for the Xenopus oocytes and 4 012 interferon units/mg RNA/hour for the reticulocyte lysates. The translation product fulfilled the usual criteria for mouse interferon, viz. species specificity and neutralization by specific anti-mouse interferon antiserum. Upon injection of <b>crude</b> <b>interferon</b> mRNA into Xenopus oocytes, interferon activity appeared {{both in the}} oocyte homogenates and the oocyte incubation medium.

SVMPA has another phenotype: although able to replicate normally in primary cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF), its replication is restricted in secondary cultures prepared from aged primary CEF cultures. The mutations responsible for these phenotypes mapped to the region of the viral genome that codes for nsP 1. We report here that SVMPA has yet another phenotype. Relative to our standard Sindbis virus (SVSTD) from which it was derived, SVMPA shows an increased sensitivity to chick interferon, both <b>crude</b> <b>interferon</b> prepared from virus-infected cells and recombinant interferon.

40|$|Partially {{purified}} mouse interferon type I (Mu IFN-beta), <b>crude</b> mouse <b>interferon</b> type II (Mu IFN-gamma) serum, and the {{interferon inducer}} polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) were evaluated for {{their effects on}} the growth of spontaneously occurring mammary carcinomas in BALB/c mice. As soon as their tumors had reached a palpable size (diameter: 3 - 5 mm), the mice received three ip injections of Mu IFN-beta, Mu IFN-gamma, or poly I:C per week for 6 weeks. A significant (fourfold to fivefold) reduction in tumor size was achieved with Mu IFN-beta (at 10 (6) U/mouse), Mu IFN-gamma (at 10 (3) U/mouse), and poly I:C (at 1 mg/mouse). A similar reduction in tumor size was noted when the mice were treated with cyclophosphamide (2. 5 mg/mouse, three ip injections per wk for 6 wk). Treatment with Mu IFN-beta combined with Mu IFN-gamma resulted in a greater tumor growth-inhibitory effect than treatment with either Mu IFN-beta or Mu IFN-gamma alone. In addition to inhibiting the growth of primary tumors, interferon also reduced the incidence of lung metastases. However, complete tumor regression was not observed in any mouse while under interferon therapy. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Human {{interferon}} {{prepared by}} challenge of leukocytes with Sendai virus, or of fibroblasts with double-stranded poly(inosinic acid) ·poly(cytidylic acid), {{has been studied}} with respect to purification by affinity chromatography. Both leukocyte and fibroblast interferons are removed from crude tissue culture fluids by means of columns of antibody to leukocyte interferon attached to Sepharose- 4 B. The antibody was prepared in sheep using, as antigen, material that had been partially purified by gel filtration through Sephadex G- 100 columns. Many of the impurities in the <b>crude</b> fibroblast <b>interferon</b> were presumably not recognized by the sheep antibodies induced by leukocyte interferon. Fibroblast interferon was, therefore, much more effectively purified {{as the result of}} this “common denominator” approach. The fibroblast product, in contrast to interferon from leukocytes, could only be harvested efficiently from the crude starting material when a carrier protein (bovine-serum albumin, and later, cytochrome c) was added to the eluting buffers to counteract losses, presumably due to adsorption on purification and assay equipment. Both varieties of interferon exhibit molecular weights of approximately 20, 000 - 25, 000, although association with higher molecular weight proteins occurs...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the influence of various crude and recombinant cytokines on the ingestion and intracellular survival of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis within bovine monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. Cytokine pretreatment {{had little effect on}} the ingestion of M. paratuberculosis by bovine monocytes and macrophages. Monocytes that were continuously incubated with virus-induced <b>crude</b> bovine <b>interferon</b> (100 U) or recombinant bovine alpha interferon (100 U) significantly restricted the subsequent intracellular growth of M. paratuberculosis, as determined by microscopic counts of acid-fast bacilli and by recovery of CFU from lysed monocyte monolayers. In contrast to their effects on freshly adherent monocytes, these cytokines had little effect on the growth of M. paratuberculosis within monocyte-derived macrophages. In two separate experiments, we also observed inhibition of bacillary growth in monocytes treated with unpurified recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Conversely, intracellular growth of M. paratuberculosis was enhanced in monocytes that were pretreated with culture supernatants from M. paratuberculosis-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from an immunized calf. The growth-enhancing activity of these supernatants was labile at pH 2. 0, suggesting a role for gamma interferon; however, subsequent experiments indicated that recombinant gamma interferon alone neither enhanced nor restricted intracellular bacillary growth. To determine the possible contributions of monocyte oxidative activity to cytokine-induced bacteriostasis, we compared the release of superoxide anion from cytokine-treated and control monocytes. No obvious relationship was observed between the release of superoxide anion and the subsequent intracellular fate of the bacilli...|$|R

(2002), 12 (6), 916 – 920 made it {{possible}} to produce biomedically important substances in large amounts [1, 4, 7, 11, 15], one of which is human leukocyte interferon (IFNα- 2). The most popular protocols for recovery of IFNα- 2 synthesized in host bacteria, mostly in Escherichia coli, are based on the use of monoclonal antibodies [5, 17, 21, 22]. Although the antibody column has been proven to be a powerful tool for purifying <b>crude</b> <b>interferon,</b> a complete purification has never been achieved by one-step immunoaffinity chromatography.

40|$|<b>Crude</b> <b>interferon</b> {{preparations}} from primary guinea-pig embryo cells {{infected with}} vesicular stomatitis virus strain T 1026 R 1 {{were shown to}} be more sensitive to heat (37 °C), pH 2. 0, and SDS than crude mouse interferon. Since the proportion of antiviral activity lost after each treatment was nearly the same, the existence of a single fraction of antiviral activity sensitive to all three treatments was suggested. Support for this possibility was given by the finding that subjecting this guinea-pig interferon to any one of the treatments rendered it insensitive to the effects of the other two. We have previously shown that guinea-pig embryo fibroblasts (GPE cells) infected with several different viruses were capable of producing more antiviral activity (interferon) than had been previously reported by other laboratories (Kaplan et al., 1962; Friedman et al., 1962; Lackovic et al., 1979; Warfel & Stewart, 1980; Sonnenfeld, 1981; Christofinis, 1980), but that much of this activity was too labile to be detected by conventional means (Winship et al., 1983). It was found that virus type, multiplicity of infection, and cell age are important factors in determining the total yield of these substances (Winship et al., 1983).

40|$|The {{influence}} of infection by herpes implex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) on the respiratory burst capacity of mouse macrophages was studied by luminol-dependent chemilu-minescence with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) as trigger. Peritoneal cells from virus-infected mice were strongly primed for a respiratory burst during the acute {{phase of the}} infection, By l 2 h after infection the response had increased 40 -fold over control values. Most of the response was elicited by mononuclear phagocytes. When resting peritoneal macrophages were infected with HSV- 2 in vitro a maximal priming effect was seen with 2 × 106 p. f. u. /ml of virus after 8 h, but a significant response was obtained after 4 h of infection; after 12 h incubation with virus the response declined to reach background levels at 24 h. Peritoneal cells from C 57 BL/ 6 mice which are relatively resistant to HSV- 2 showed a higher respiratory burst capacity after infection than cells from more susceptible BALB/c mice. Incubation of macrophages with <b>crude</b> murine <b>interferon</b> (IFN) -~/fl produced by macrophages or purified murine IFN-~, in concentrations comparable to those obtained early (2 to 5 h) after infection of macrophage cultures with HSV- 2 also augmented the respiratory burst.

40|$|The {{ability of}} interferons to reduce cell {{proliferation}} in vitro and in vivo is a well-studied phenomenon. To extend such observations, {{the effect of}} interferons on the invasiveness in vitro of human malignant cells derived from a Ewing sarcoma was evaluated. Two related parameters were examined: (i) production of type IV (basement membrane) collagenase and (ii) penetration of human amnion basement membrane and collagenous stroma. After 6 days of treatment with crude fibroblast, leukocyte, or lymphoblastoid interferon at 100 units/ml in serum-free medium, type IV collagenase levels increased 2 - to 4 -fold per cell relative to those of untreated controls. With homogeneous fibroblast and lymphoblastoid interferons, a 2 -fold elevation in type IV collagenase was detected after 2 days, with further increases, occasionally dramatic, occurring on the 4 th and 6 th day of treatment. The ability of Ewing sarcoma cells to invade human amnion connective tissue was measured after 6 days of treatment with various interferons. Relative to the behavior of untreated controls, <b>crude</b> leukocyte <b>interferon,</b> homogeneous lymphoblastoid interferon, and homogeneous fibroblast interferon at 100 units/ml augmented invasiveness 3 -, 17 - and 22 -fold, respectively, when cells were allowed 4 days in which to traverse the amnion.

Conditioned media from PBL cultures contained, {{in addition to}} IFN-gamma, a mixture of cytotoxins, including classic lymphocyte-derived lymphotoxin (LT), and a TPA-induced cytotoxic activity produced by the adherent cell population (presumably monocytes). These two types of cytotoxins, indistinguishable in the mouse L 929 cell LT assay, could be differentiated by an antiserum prepared against LT derived from the B lymphoblastoid cell line RPMI 1788. This antiserum neutralized lymphocyte-derived classic LT but failed to neutralize {{the activity of the}} monocyte-derived cytotoxin. Processing of conditioned media by sequential chromatography on silicic acid, Con A-Sepharose, and DEAE- Sephacel failed to separate IFN-gamma from the LT activity. However, this procedure did remove the monocyte-derived cytotoxic activity present in the original starting material, leaving predominantly classic LT. This LT showed a slightly basic isoelectric point (pI 7. 6) which partially overlapped the more basic pI range of IFN-gamma. The two lymphokine activities also could not be completely separated by fast protein liquid chromatography or molecular sieve chromatography. LT in these partially purified preparations was associated with a protein having an apparent molecular weight of 58, 000 on gel filtration. This form dissociated partially into a 20, 000 mol wt species after denaturation with 0. 1 % NaDodSO 4.
