As noted in its mottos and advertisements, BK cooks its burgers and grilled chicken on an {{automated}} grill, while its other chicken products, fish, sides, and breakfast sausage are deep-fried in vegetable oil. BK prepares its biscuits, cinnamon rolls, and cookies by baking in a <b>convection</b> <b>oven</b> and microwaves its BK Veggie burger patty.|$|E
25|$|A {{variant of}} the {{conventional}} microwave is the convection microwave. A convection microwave oven {{is a combination of}} a standard microwave and a <b>convection</b> <b>oven.</b> It allows food to be cooked quickly, yet come out browned or crisped, as from a <b>convection</b> <b>oven.</b> Convection microwaves are more expensive than conventional microwave ovens. Some convection microwaves—those with exposed heating elements—can produce smoke and burning odors as food spatter from earlier microwave-only use is burned off the heating elements.|$|E

The core is then baked in a <b>convection</b> <b>oven</b> between [...] The heat causes the binder to cross-link or polymerize. While this process is simple, the dimensional accuracy is low.|$|E
50|$|Infrared heating is also {{becoming}} more popular in industrial manufacturing processes, e.g. curing of coatings, forming of plastics, annealing, plastic welding, and print drying. In these applications, infrared heaters replace <b>convection</b> <b>ovens</b> and contact heating.|$|R
50|$|<b>Convection</b> <b>ovens</b> {{distribute}} heat evenly {{around the}} food, removing the blanket of cooler air that surrounds food {{when it is}} first placed in an oven and allowing food to cook more evenly in less time and at a lower temperature than in a conventional oven.|$|R
50|$|The {{heat source}} is {{normally}} from ceramic infrared heaters, which transfers {{the heat to}} the assemblies by means of radiation. Ovens which also use fans to force heated air towards the assemblies (which are usually used in combination with ceramic infrared heaters) are called infrared <b>convection</b> <b>ovens.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{convection}} {{microwave ovens}} which combine a <b>convection</b> <b>oven</b> with {{a microwave oven}} to cook food {{with the speed of}} a microwave oven and the browning ability of a <b>convection</b> <b>oven.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>convection</b> <b>oven</b> {{contains a}} blower that actively forces heated air throughout {{all areas of}} the chamber. The flow created by the blower ensures uniform temperatures and the equal transfer of heat throughout the load. For this reason, the mechanical <b>convection</b> <b>oven</b> is the more efficient of the two processes.|$|E
50|$|In 1971 it {{introduced}} its Circotherm system whereby hot air was circulated around {{the oven to}} allow a distribution of cooking with more regularity. These cookers are known as <b>convection</b> <b>oven</b> or fan ovens, and are still for a specialist market. The Circotherm system was patented by the company, marketed under the slogan Rundum-Hitze ist mehr (all around heat is more). In 1985, the <b>convection</b> <b>oven</b> system was first introduced for gas ovens.|$|E

40|$|Hamburgers {{and chicken}} fillets were cooked in <b>convection</b> <b>ovens,</b> deep-fried or contact fried and {{analysed}} for mutagenic activity using the Ames test. For the three different <b>convection</b> <b>ovens,</b> the cooking parameters studied included {{the presence of}} steam, air velocity, air temperature and holding time. For deep-frying and contact frying, the cooking parameters included cooking temperature and cooking time. In cooked hamburgers, mutagenic activity was only detected in those that had been deep-fried. In chicken fillets, mutagenic activity was detected in samples prepared with all cooking methods, being highest in the deep-fried samples. Factorial analysis indicated that heat transfer {{was the most important}} factor affecting mutagenic activity. High temperature and high air velocity in the <b>convection</b> <b>ovens</b> enhanced mutagenic activity. The presence of steam reduced the mutagenic activity, except when high temperature was used in combination with high air velocity. In chicken fillets, high mutagenic activity correlated to high weight loss during cooking. Pan-fried chicken fillets were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the mutagenic/carcinogenic heterocyclic amines 2 -amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]-quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 -phenylimidazo-[4, 5 -b]-pyridine (PhIP) and the co-mutagenic heterocyclic amine Norharman (9 H-pyrido[3, 4 -b]-indole) were identified. The HPLC fractions were tested for mutagenic activity and, apart from the mutagenic fractions corresponding to MeIQx and PhIP, several mutagenic fractions were detected that did not correspond to known heterocyclic amines...|$|R
5000|$|Ovens {{are mostly}} hollow devices that get very hot (up to [...] ) {{and are used}} for baking or {{roasting}} and offer a dry-heat cooking method. Different cuisines will use different types of ovens. For example, Indian culture uses a tandoor oven, which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature. Western kitchens use variable temperature <b>convection</b> <b>ovens,</b> conventional ovens, toaster ovens, or non-radiant heat ovens like the microwave oven. Classic Italian cuisine includes {{the use of a}} brick oven containing burning wood. Ovens may be wood-fired, coal-fired, gas, electric, or oil-fired.|$|R

50|$|Combi steamers are cooking assistants used {{primarily}} to prepare food for {{larger numbers of}} people at one time. Combi steamers replace practically all conventional industrial-scale cooking appliances, such as <b>convection</b> <b>ovens,</b> stoves, pots and grills. They combine the advantages of steaming (e.g., short cooking times, low cooking loss levels, juiciness) with those of convection heat (e.g., intense flavor, appetizing color, crisp crusts).|$|R

50|$|Ovens usually can use {{a variety}} of methods to cook. The most common may be to heat the oven from below. This is {{commonly}} used for baking and roasting. The oven may also be able to heat from the top to provide broiling (US) or grilling (UK/Commonwealth). In order to provide faster, more-even cooking, a fan oven, which has a fan with a heating element around, that provides the heat. Or a fan-assisted oven that use a small fan to circulate the air in the cooking chamber, can be used. Both also known as <b>convection</b> <b>ovens.</b> An oven may also provide an integrated rotisserie.|$|R
40|$|Patented {{surface heating}} devices {{with a much}} faster air-to-solid heat {{transfer}} rate than previous air ovens were developed. The accelerated surface heating can brown, sear or crisp much more rapidly than in conventional ovens so that partially prepared food can be finished quickly and tastefully immediately before serving. The crisp, freshly browned surfaces result from the faster heat transfer which does not dry out the food. The devices are then compared to <b>convection</b> <b>ovens</b> and microwave heating processes...|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} {{skill in}} convenience cooking is time management. This genre of cooking focuses largely on process and technique rather than ingredients, and {{is aimed at}} getting the best quality out of a quickly prepared meal as possible, especially using common kitchen tools rather than specialized equipment such as <b>convection</b> <b>ovens</b> and microwave ovens. Some recipes remove certain steps that take large amounts of time. Sometimes kneading dough {{is removed from the}} process of making bread because it requires large amounts of time and effort.|$|R
