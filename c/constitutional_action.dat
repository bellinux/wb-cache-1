At 90 percent, his score was higher than most Democrats in the Senate, and was fourth highest amongst all members. Issues considered when rating senators included their positions on civil rights, mass transit, D.C. home rule, tax reform, and reducing overseas troop levels. The League of Women Voters gave Mathias a 100% on issues important to them, and the AFL-CIO agreed with Mathias on 32 out of 45 key labor votes. Conversely, the conservative group Americans for <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Action</b> stated Mathias agreed with their positions only 16% of the time.|$|E

The decision did not include pension or social security (health insurance) rights. In a second ruling of 5 October 2007, the Constitutional court extended social security (health insurance) benefits to same-sex couples, and in a ruling on 17 April 2008 pension rights were extended. With these three rulings, same-sex couples in Colombia now enjoy the main benefits as heterosexual couples under the same terms.|$|E
25|$|During 1915 Redmond felt {{secure in}} his course {{and that the}} path was already partly cleared for Home Rule to be {{achieved}} without bloodshed. He was supported by continued by-election successes of the IPP, and felt strong enough {{to turn down the}} offer of a cabinet seat, which would have offset Carson's appointment to the war cabinet but would have been unpopular in Ireland. Even in 1916 he felt supremely confident and optimistic despite timely warnings from Bonar Law of an impending insurrection. Redmond did not expect the 1916 Easter Rising, which was staged by the remaining Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, led by a number of influential republicans, under Patrick Pearse. Pearse, who had in 1913 stood with Redmond on the same platform where the Rising now took place, had at that time praised Redmond's efforts in achieving the promise of Home Rule. Redmond later acknowledged that the Rising was a shattering blow to his lifelong policy of <b>constitutional</b> <b>action.</b> It equally helped fuel republican sentiment, particularly when General Maxwell executed the leaders of the Rising, treating them as traitors in wartime.|$|E

According to the New York State Constitution, it is the duty of the state legislature to fill executive vacancies. The governor was criticized as unreasonable for admonishing the legislature when it took <b>constitutional</b> <b>actions.</b> The appointment of state assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli to succeed the disgraced Alan Hevesi as New York State Comptroller was a serious blow to the new governor. Spitzer had backed an outside panel to draft a list of qualified candidates; the legislature resisted Spitzer's desires when these included no legislators. Some Assembly Democrats were alienated over the incident, and questioned Spitzer's refusal of extending patronage to party members seeking local political appointments.|$|R

The hearing was called by Congressman Chris Shays (R-CT). In the testimony, the Office of the Inspector General stated that it {{had the authority to}} investigate adverse security clearance and access decisions as part of its broad responsibility for investigating allegations that individuals suffered reprisal for making disclosures of fraud, waste and abuse to certain authorities. Meyer's February 2006 testimony discussed the importance of whistleblower-initiated complaints driving the investigative process so that the offices of inspectors general are not used to target whistleblowers. The issue arose in an exchange with Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) and related to the experience of Sgt. Samuel Provance. In his Congressional testimony, Meyer's positions have typically supported the independence of discrete <b>constitutional</b> <b>actions.</b> This concern for the independence of government decision-making is also present in his first appearance in a court of law, making oral argument in United States v.

40|$|The {{fruition}} {{of fundamental}} rights like healthcare, education, worthy housing and work {{is directly related}} to the creation and implantation of universal and egalitarian public policies by the Congress and the Public Administration. In the cases where the existing public policies are shown to be insufficient, inadequate or do not achieve the fundamental goals of the Federative Republic of Brazil, it arises the need of the action of the jurisdictional function to control the constitutionality over these public policies. In Brazil, this control is made both by direct way, by means of its own <b>constitutional</b> <b>actions,</b> and by diffuse way, by means of collective actions interposed in first instances courts. In this context, the enforcement of the liberal theories like Montesquieu’s Separation of Powers and the Intangibility of the Discretionary Activities reveal themselves incoherent with the Democratic Rule-of-the-Law State. In another way, the jurisdictional action is limited by the Reasonableness, by the Possible Reserve and by the Existential Minimum, and can also find some obstacles in the individual actions that end up influencing the public policies. Therefore, there is a great effort to colectivizing individual actions by Brazilian schoolars. Another problem is the difficulty of Judical Power in using the adequate procedural class action. It will be analyzed one specific decisions made by the Court of Justice of the State of São Paulo about the jurisdictional control of public policies related to the autistic people, with a goal to point out a direction to the improvement of the jurisdictional tutelage in terms of effectiveness and adequacy...|$|R
