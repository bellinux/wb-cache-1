40|$|BS>The {{standard}} vertical {{fuel tube}} {{assembly of the}} CP- 5 research reactor was modified to permit diversion of heavywater coolant into the thimble for temperature-controlled irradiation experiments of capsules containing fuel specimens. The modification entailed revisions to the thimble, outer top shield plug and <b>center</b> <b>shield</b> plug. and helium sweep system. The modified thimble is provided with inlet actor flow system through the thimble cavity. The coolant in the thimble removes fission heat from the encapsulated samples introduced into the thimble cavity. Flow tests of the thimble were first performed on a flow stand, with final flow characteristics being determined in the reactor. A helium purge system was incorporated to remove dissociation gases trapped in the thimble cavity. Four configurations of capsules and capsule baskets were flow tested under conditions simulating operating flow conditions from 2 - to 10 -Mw reactor power. Irradiation capsules are now being satisfactorily operated in the modified thimbles at 2 -Mw reactor power. (auth...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the middle}} of the twentieth century there has been a process of {{dramatic}} change in the history of warfare. The change in the landscape, i. e., natural landscapes turning into urban areas, requires a change in the nature of war, both {{on the part of the}} defense and on the part of the attacker. Longstanding rules among military experts to avoid entering cities unless absolutely necessary are no longer relevant given the changing reality. Today, areas that in the past were open have become urban, thereby not leaving the attacker any choice but to conduct urban warfare. Moreover, decisions are no longer taken on the open battlefield, rather in the offices of the decision makers, relatively few in number, who are generally tucked away in city centers (often near TV studios and other communications <b>centers</b> <b>shielded</b> by massive numbers of hostages) ...|$|R
