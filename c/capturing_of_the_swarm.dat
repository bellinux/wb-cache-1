40|$|When Jupiter was on <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> {{three to}} ten earth masses in size, there {{undoubtedly}} was a considerably larger mass of condensed matter in its zone, since Jupiter would have perturbed {{most of it}} to other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar system. Monte Carlo studies indicate a significant portion would have crossed the earth's orbit. If the earth and moon had not yet fully formed, <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> earth-zone planetesimals being hit by this Jupiter-scattered material was high. Further Monte Carlo models of these collisions and their products indicate {{a significant portion of}} matter was heated to melting, even if less than 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relative kinetic energy went into heat. The models include capture probabilities by an embryo earth and a protolunar swarm. Because heat energy is correlated with comminution energy, and because <b>the</b> <b>capture</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swarm</b> is mass-dependent while embryo's is not, the protolunar material suffered much higher heating on the average than did the proto-earth material...|$|R

At the target, each capsule decomposes into 4,000 delivery microcapsules of 10−10 kg and of 30 micrometer radius that allow intact entry to planetary atmospheres. For missions {{that do not}} encounter dense gas zones, such as interstellar transit to mature planets or to habitable zones about stars, the microcapsules can be launched directly from 1 au using 10−9 kg sails of 1.8 mm radius to achieve velocities of 0.0005 c to be decelerated by radiation pressure for capture at the targets.

40|$|Behavior {{and diving}} {{patterns}} of summer resident gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) foraging on mysids were studied in coastal bays along <b>the</b> north shore <b>of</b> Queen Charlotte Strait, British Columbia, Canada. In this region, gray whales feed primarily on planktonic prey {{in the water}} column rather than on the benthos as in their better-studied primary feeding areas. During <b>the</b> summers <b>of</b> 1999 and 2000, whales spent most of their time actively feeding or searching for prey (77 %), whereas only 15 % of their time was spent traveling and 8 % socializing. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dives were short; the median dive duration was 1. 73 min with 2 respirations per surfacing and 13 sec between blows. Whales dove frequently, spending only 11 % of their time at the surface with an overall blow rate of 1. 09 per minute. Activity states were characterized by significantly different diving and respiratory parameters; when feeding, whales made shorter dives, respired fewer times during a surfacing, with shorter blow intervals, and spent less time at the surface compared to traveling or searching whales. This diving pattern differs from benthic-feeding whales and likely optimizes <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mobile mysid <b>swarms</b> in shallow waters...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} early {{convergence}} in <b>the</b> Particle <b>Swarm</b> Optimization (PSO) algorithm often causes the search process to be {{trapped in a}} local optimum. This problem often occurs when <b>the</b> diversity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swarm</b> decreases and <b>the</b> <b>swarm</b> cannot escape from a local optimal. In this paper, a novel dynamic diversity enhancement particle swarm optimization (DDEPSO) algorithm is introduced. In this variant of PSO, we periodically replace some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swarm's</b> particles by artificial ones, which are generated based on <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> search process, {{in order to enhance}} <b>the</b> diversity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swarm</b> and promote <b>the</b> exploration ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> algorithm. Afterwards, we update <b>the</b> velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artificial particles in corresponding generating period by a new velocity equation with the minimum inertia weight in order to enhance <b>the</b> exploitation potentiality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swarm.</b> <b>The</b> performance <b>of</b> this approach has been tested on <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> twelve standard unimodal and multimodal (Rotated or unrotated) benchmark problems and the results have been compared with our previous work as well as four other variants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PSO algorithm.

40|$|In {{this article}} we specify an-member “individual-based” {{continuous}} time swarm model with individuals that move in an-dimensional space according to an attractant/repellent or a nutrient profile. <b>The</b> motion <b>of</b> each individual is determined by three factors: i) attraction to the other individuals on long distances; ii) repulsion from the other individuals on short distances; and iii) attraction to the more favorable regions (or repulsion from <b>the</b> unfavorable regions) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attractant/repellent profile. <b>The</b> emergent behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swarm</b> motion is <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> a balance between inter-individual interactions and <b>the</b> simultaneous interactions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swarm</b> members with their environment.
