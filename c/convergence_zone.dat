5|$|July 29, 1975- A {{tropical}} depression moves into southern Mississippi after creating a strong <b>convergence</b> <b>zone</b> with a ridge over the western Atlantic Ocean. The <b>convergence</b> <b>zone</b> produces heavy rainfall {{of up to}} 20inches (510mm) along the western Florida Panhandle, resulting in moderate stream flooding and $8.5million in damage in the state (1975USD, $34million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|The Puget Sound <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone</b> is an {{important}} feature of Seattle's weather. In the <b>convergence</b> <b>zone,</b> air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur {{north and south of}} town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to , an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone</b> and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.|$|E

40|$|Thunderstorms {{that form}} along lake-/sea-breeze <b>convergence</b> <b>zones</b> over the northeastern U. S. {{sometimes}} are observed to become severe when they migrate from their source regions. These thunderstorms {{can be challenging}} to forecast because they can form {{in the absence of}} clearly defined synoptic-scale or mesoscale precursor disturbances. The dynamical and thermodynamical processes, modulated by physiographic effects, that are responsible for creating severe weather from lake-/sea-breeze <b>convergence</b> <b>zones</b> are discussed through selected case studies. Eleven cases were selected for analysis in the northeastern U. S. between 2000 and 2006 where lake-/sea-breeze circulations helped to initiate or suppress convection. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction–North American Regional Reanalysis gridded dataset, the Rapid Update Cycle gridded dataset, radar data, soundings, and surface observations were used to construct the analyses. These 11 cases were divided into two categories: pure cases, where lake-/sea-breeze <b>convergence</b> <b>zones</b> were primarily responsible for initiatin...|$|R
40|$|Data from {{satellites}} and reanalysis products are analyzed {{to study the}} behavior of wave trains in the three major Southern Hemisphere Convergences zones: the South Pacific, the South Atlantic, and the South Indian. Using composites on high rain-rate days, a wave pattern is identified that is characteristic of high rain events. This wave pattern is then compared to the patterns of variability of brightness temperature using empirical orthogonal functions. A linear regression technique is {{used to examine the}} behavior of potential vorticity corresponding to the patterns of maximum variance. Planetary-scale waves, propagating in favorable regions, slow and break, dragging streamers of moisture from the tropics into higher latitudes. These streamers, combined with lifting, lead to the enhanced rain seen in the Southern Hemisphere?s <b>convergence</b> <b>zones.</b> It is concluded that the <b>convergence</b> <b>zones</b> are areas of enhanced streamer activity and that a more thorough study of streamers will yield more information on the structure and behavior of the <b>convergence</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R
5|$|The South Indian <b>convergence</b> <b>zone</b> {{spawned a}} {{circulation}} that organized into a tropical {{depression in the}} Mozambique Channel on January9. It gradually intensified while moving to the southwest, developing spiral rainbands. On January11, Elinah passed between Anjouan and Mohéli in the Comoros archipelago. The next day, JTWC upgraded the storm to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, although land interaction with Mozambique weakened Elinah. After it turned to the south and moved away from the coast, the storm re-intensified, and MFR estimated Elinah reached peak winds of 115km/h (70mph) on January14. Subsequently, the <b>convergence</b> <b>zone</b> caused the storm to weaken, ultimately absorbing it by January16.|$|E
5|$|The global {{moisture}} {{budget is}} primarily being influenced by tropical sea surface temperatures {{from the position}} of the Intertropical <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone</b> (ITCZ). The Southern Hemisphere has a unique meteorological feature positioned in the southwestern Pacific Basin called the South Pacific <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone</b> (SPCZ), which contains a perennial position within the Southern Hemisphere. During ENSO warm periods, the SPCZ reverses orientation extending from the equator down south through Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and towards the French Polynesian Islands; and due east towards South America affecting geochemistry of corals in tropical regions.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Five-E formed {{out of a}} weak {{tropical}} wave, {{associated with}} scattered convection, which formed {{off the coast of}} Africa on June 23. The wave was moving towards the west at the rate of 23mph (37km/h), due to an area of high pressure located over the north-central Atlantic Ocean leading to a prevailing easterly flow. Some cyclonic turning was noted and convection was {{on either side of the}} axis the center of the stormbut was mainly in association with the Intertropical <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone</b> (ITCZ).

40|$|International audienceOver the Mediterranean Pyrenees {{and near}} coastal region {{there is a}} high {{frequency}} of convective storms during summertime. This fact determines a local maximum of precipitation at this season unlike the normal and general minimum over Mediterranean basin. The common synoptic and mesoscale patterns associated to convective phenomena are briefly analyzed and diagnosed with radar imagery, surface pressure and isobaric level fields and surface data. They usually involves a little distant through at medium levels, very weak pressure gradient at the surface and not significant instability, but a preferred Planetary Boundary Layer low-level <b>convergence</b> <b>zones</b> tied to the orography. As a result of this analysis two different kinds of circulations associated to recurrent <b>convergence</b> <b>zones</b> have been recognized: upvalley/upslope winds and sea breezes. High resolution simulations from a Numerical Weather Prediction model for a case study have carried out to analyze the role of the main key components, i. e. the orography, the sea and valley breeze and their influence to generate local <b>convergence</b> <b>zones.</b> Furthermore, the skills of the model to simulate the location and the intensity of the precipitation of these summer Mediterranean storms have been discussed...|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa near Dakar on August 31. It moved westward into the Intertropical <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone,</b> and organized into a tropical disturbance on September 2 with a small, circular area of convection. The system moved to the west, and on September 3, the convection diminished after moving west of 40° W. By the next day, the tropical disturbance was barely discernible from the clouds of the Intertropical <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone.</b> The wave gradually became detached from the ITCZ, and based on a reconnaissance flight that confirmed the existence of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on September 5 while located 255 miles (415 km) east of Grenada.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the same}} {{tropical}} wave that formed Tropical Storm Danny in the Atlantic crossed over the Isthmus of Panama and became a disturbance in the Intertropical <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone</b> during mid to late September.

5|$|A {{disturbance}} in the South Indian <b>convergence</b> <b>zone</b> near Seychelles persisted on October24 with {{an area of}} convection. It gradually organized while passing near Agaléga. On October27, it developed into a tropical depression, and after Dvorak classifications of 2.5, the system was named Arilisy. It became disorganized on October29, never having intensified beyond winds of 50km/h (30mph). After moving to the southwest for much of its duration, Arilisy dissipated on October30.|$|E

30|$|Similar {{accounts}} pervade the literature. For example, theories attributing conceptual {{knowledge to}} distributed cell assemblies (e.g., Martin, 2016; Pulvermüller, 2013) propose that disparate sets of neurons representing distinct modality-specific properties (color, form, sound, texture, etc.) aggregate in <b>convergence</b> <b>zones</b> (Damasio, 1989) {{located near the}} center, or hub, of neural circuits where divergent regions converge to bind the features of a given conceptual representation. <b>Convergence</b> <b>zones</b> are likely candidates for the high-level conceptual models within the PC framework—low-level feature circuits intersect in CZs where they inform and/or update the current representation based on error signals. Importantly, several studies (e.g., Hsu et al., 2012; Simmons et al., 2007) report real-time feedback between low-level perceptual areas in occipital cortex and higher-level conceptual areas in fusiform gyrus for color perception, providing direct evidence of PC mechanisms.|$|R
5|$|During the season, three hurricanes {{developed}} from five named storms. This was below {{the average of}} 10storms per season, and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939. Four of the five storms {{developed from}} the intertropical <b>convergence</b> <b>zone.</b> The decreased activity is partially due to the westerlies extending further south than usual, {{as well as a}} persistent ridge. In addition, temperatures in the eastern United States were cooler than usual. Activity through September10 was the quietest in 30years.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the latest}} Cape Verde-type hurricanes to form in any season, Joan formed from an area of {{convection}} in the intertropical <b>convergence</b> <b>zone</b> that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa early in October.

5|$|The main factor {{behind this}} shift {{is the high}} summer {{temperature}} difference between Central Asia and the Indian Ocean. This {{is accompanied by a}} seasonal excursion of the normally equatorial intertropical <b>convergence</b> <b>zone</b> (ITCZ), a low-pressure belt of highly unstable weather, northward towards India. This system intensified to its present strength {{as a result of the}} Tibetan Plateau's uplift, which accompanied the Eocene–Oligocene transition event, a major episode of global cooling and aridification which occurred 34–49Ma.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen-E {{formed from}} a {{disturbance}} in the intertropical <b>convergence</b> <b>zone.</b> Despite being {{located in a}} hostile environment, it managed to organize into a tropical depression on November 14.

Consequently, the depression degenerated into a remnant low on November 16 and dissipated soon after that.|$|E
50|$|Very large depth charges, {{including}} nuclear weapons, may be detonated at sufficient {{depth to}} create multiple damaging shock waves.

5|$|A {{disturbance}} in the Indian Ocean intertropical <b>convergence</b> <b>zone</b> became evident {{southeast of the}} Chagos Archipelago on March16 after two cyclones {{moved away from the}} region. Based on analysis from MF, the system slowly organized while moving westward, its movement influenced by a subtropical ridge to the south. On March17, the JTWC also began tracking the system. Due to cool, dry air, the system initially did not intensify, although its passage over warmer sea surface temperatures on March19 allowed for strengthening. On March19, MF classified the disturbance as Tropical Storm Nadia after rainbands developed. A day later, the JTWC designated Nadia as Tropical Cyclone 23S.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on October3. It tracked westward, reaching the Caribbean Sea on October10. By October13, a large area of convection persisted from Hispaniola southwestward through Panama, and {{over the next few days}} the convection organized and concentrated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. An anticyclone became established near Jamaica on October15, which created a favorable upper-level environment for the system by reducing wind shear. Around the same time, a low-level trough emerged from the Intertropical <b>Convergence</b> <b>Zone,</b> heading north off the coast of Nicaragua. Early on October 16, the system developed into a broad tropical depression about halfway between Central America and Jamaica.|$|E
