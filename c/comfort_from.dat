5|$|Fatboy and Poppy's {{relationship}} turns sour when Poppy {{suggests that}} they should buy a house together. Fatboy eventually pulls himself together and tells her that they haven't been together long enough yet. She then ends their relationship and Fatboy moves in with Tamwar. Fatboy later suggests to Poppy that they rent a flat to begin with and take it from there. The couple reunite with a romantic kiss. However, when Denise feels uncomfortable with the way her new fiancée Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is currently treating her, she gets <b>comfort</b> <b>from</b> Fatboy and the pair are unable to resist each other. When Poppy finds out that they shared a kiss, they realise {{that they are not}} right for each other and Poppy returns to go and live with her mum. Upset by the couple's break-up, Fatboy gently tells Dot that her and Poppy are still friends. He supports Dot when he learns that her son Nick Cotton (John Altman) dies and is surprised by the arrival of her estranged grandson, Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett). When Fatboy is told that he is no longer needed at The Queen Vic, he accepts a job at Ian's restaurant as a waiter. Denise feels awkward and confesses the truth to Ian, but doesn't mention Fatboy's name. Fatboy spends time away from Walford caring for his uncle when he falls ill, and, on his return, Dot suggests that he finds a new place to live, due to Charlie moving in with her and her only being allowed one lodger by council regulations. When Charlie's son is born, Fatboy is unsuccessful in persuading Charlie to take the baby home. He follows Charlie home and discovers that Nick is alive. When Charlie later moves out, Fatboy moves back in with Dot. On Ladies' Night at the Vic, Fatboy consoles Denise when their kiss during the engagement party is revealed. Tina visits Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) to find Fatboy with her.|$|E

He became desperately ill himself and returned home to be nursed by Emma who gave birth to their third son in August, then in November was devastated when his father died. Emma sustained him, and they read religious books together. In February 1849 he drew some <b>comfort</b> <b>from</b> Harriet Martineau's new Eastern Life, Past and Present, a travelogue of tombs with the message that Christian beliefs in reward and punishment were founded in heathen superstitions.|$|E
25|$|Some feminists contend that, as {{with other}} women saints such as Joan of Arc, the image of Mary is a {{construct}} of the patriarchal mind. They argue that Marian dogmas and doctrines and the typical forms of Marian devotion reinforce patriarchy by offering women temporary <b>comfort</b> <b>from</b> the ongoing oppression inflicted on them by male dominated churches and societies. In the feminist view, old gender stereotypes persist within traditional Marian teachings and theological doctrines. To that end books on feminist Mariology have been published to present opposing interpretations and perspectives.|$|E
25|$|During the Austro-Prussian War, Victoria and Frederick {{received}} a hard blow. Sigismund, their fourth child, died of meningitis at 21 months on 18 June 1866, {{just a few}} days before the Battle of Königgrätz. This tragedy weakened the Crown Princess, who found no <b>comfort</b> <b>from</b> her mother or her in-laws. Queen Augusta demanded that her daughter-in-law quickly resume her official duties instead of feeling sorry for herself. Queen Victoria, who was still mourning the loss of Prince Albert, didn't understand the feelings of her daughter and considered that the loss of a child was much less severe than that of a husband.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution and the inter-continental trade rendered the development of secure links between continents imperative. Being at the top among the colonial powers, the United Kingdom needed stable maritime routes to connect different parts of its empire: the Far East, India, Australia, etc. The birth of the concept of international water and the lack of any claim to it simplified navigation.. In 1818, the Black Ball Line, with a fleet of sailing ships, offered the first regular passenger service with emphasis on passenger <b>comfort,</b> <b>from</b> England to the United States.|$|E

He can do little though, since the red-haired müdir has confiscated most of the supplies, that were intended for the Armenians as a humanitarian gesture, approved by Turkey’s highest religious authority. The camp, filled with smoke from the forest fires, inspires a vision in him that anticipates the Holocaust and the death camps of World War II.|$|E

25|$|By April and May 1971, Genie's {{scores on}} the Leiter International Performance Scale tests had {{dramatically}} increased, with her overall mental age {{at the level of}} a typical 4-year-9-month-old, but on individual components she still showed a very high level of scatter. Her progress with language accelerated, and doctors noticed that the words she used indicated a fairly advanced mental categorization of objects and situations and focused on objective properties to a degree not normally found in children. Around that time, when a minor earthquake struck Los Angeles, she ran frightened into the kitchen and rapidly verbalized to some of the hospital cooks she had befriended, marking the first time she sought out <b>comfort</b> <b>from</b> another person and the first time she was so readily verbal. However, she still had a hard time being with large crowds of people; at her birthday party, she became so anxious at all the guests present that she had to go outside with Rigler to calm down.|$|E

In 1690, he fought Jacobites (who supported James) in Ireland, and whilst her husband was away, Mary administered {{the government of the}} realm with the advice of a nine-member Cabinet Council.
