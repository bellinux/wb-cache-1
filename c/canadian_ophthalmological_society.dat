40|$|Objective: To {{assess how}} the University of Toronto Visiting Professors Rounds Series (UTVPRS) {{influenced}} the knowledge, perceptions, and clinical decision making of Canadian ophthalmologists. Design: Longitudinal cross-sectional. Participants: Eight {{hundred and fifty}} ophthalmologists registered with the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>Society.</b> Methods: Online surveys, using multiple-choice and reflection questions, were administered before and after online viewing of the University of Toronto Ophthalmology grand rounds as screencasts. Results: At 18 months, 124 users registered and watched 429 screencasts. Most participants found UTVPRS to be organized and user friendly. Mean prescreencast correct scores were 1008 versus 1288 postscreencast (p = 0. 002). Postscreencast, 73 % of participants replied in favour of changing future practice. Conclusions: UTVPRS was well received with demonstrated knowledge gain and potential practice change. The long-term and patient-related outcomes of the results require further research. © 2014 <b>Canadian</b> <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>Society.</b> Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To determine {{the magnitude of}} the problem, the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>Society</b> (COS) Athletic Eye Injury Committee has sent questionnaires to COS members since 1976 to be completed for all racquet sports eye injuries treated. In {{the first year of the}} questionnaire 48 injuries were reported, including three legally blind eyes. From July 1978 to May 1981, 154 squash and 91 racquetball eye injuries were reported. Half the injured players required hospitalization and surgery was frequent; some players had permanent vision loss. These findings led to assessment of available eye protectors. Open-type protectors can be penetrated by balls and some closed-type protectors are not sufficiently sturdy. Steps are underway to write a Canadian standard for racquet sports eye protectors. Meanwhile the public must be informed of the danger of racquet sports eye injuries and the importance of wearing closed-type protectors...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} preferences and attitudes of Ontario ophthalmologists and ophthalmology residents toward screencasting as an educational tool with potential use for continuing medical education (CME) events. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: Eighty of 256 participants completed the survey. Methods: The surveys were sent to participants by email, with follow-up via telephone. Study participants were urban and rural Ontario ophthalmologists, registered with the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>Society,</b> and University of Toronto ophthalmology residents. Pre-recorded online presentations - screencasts - were used as the main intervention. Online surveys were used to measure multiple variables evaluating {{the attitudes of the}} participants toward screencasting. This data was then used for further quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results: Over 95 % of participants replied favourably to the introduction and future utilization of screencasting for educational purposes. Rural ophthalmologists were the most enthusiastic about future events. Practising in rural Ontario was associated with a higher interest in live broadcasts than practising in urban centres (p< 0. 02), an association supported by qualitative data. Qualitative analysis revealed geographic isolation, busy schedules, ease of use/access, and convenience to be the key factors contributing to interest in screencasting. Conclusions: Practising ophthalmologists and residents in Ontario are interested in academic online screencasting. Rural ophthalmologists were more interested in live lectures than their urban colleagues. More research is required to assess the potential of screencasting as a CME tool.

40|$|Purpose: To {{customize}} {{clinical practice}} guidelines (CPGs) for cataract {{management in the}} Iranian population. Methods: First, four CPGs (American Academy of Ophthalmology 2006 and 2011, Royal College of Ophthalmologists 2010, and <b>Canadian</b> <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>Society</b> 2008) were selected {{from a number of}} available CPGs in the literature for cataract management. All recommendations of these guidelines, together with their references, were studied. Each recommendation was summarized in 4 tables. The first table showed the recommendation itself in clinical question components format along with its level of evidence. The second table contained structured abstracts of supporting articles related to the clinical question with their levels of evidence. The third table included the customized recommendation of the internal group respecting its clinical advantage, cost, and complications. In the fourth table, the internal group their recommendations from 1 to 9 based on the customizing capability of the recommendation (applicability, acceptability, external validity). Finally, customized recommendations were sent one month prior to a consensus session to faculty members of all universities across the country asking for their comments on recommendations. Results: The agreed recommendations were accepted as conclusive while those with no agreement were discussed at the consensus session. Finally, all customized recommendations were codified as 80 recommendations along with their sources and levels of evidence for the Iranian population. Conclusion: Customization of CPGs for management of adult cataract for the Iranian population seems to be useful for standardization of referral, diagnosis and treatment of patients...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to define the overall {{anatomic}} success rate in pneumatic retinopexy and to identify morphologic features that may be predictive of treatment failure in pneumatic retinopexy. Design and Participants: Prospective consecutive interventional case series of patients with new-onset primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachments treated with pneumatic retinopexy. Methods: In this interventional case series, consecutive patients with new-onset primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachments were treated with pneumatic retinopexy and followed prospectively. Morphologic data were collected on 3 -colour fundus drawings. The primary outcome measure was treatment failure, defined as requirement for scleral buckle or vitrectomy within the follow-up period. Rates of failure for each morphologic feature were compared and a logistic regression model was fit. Results: A total of 113 eyes were included in the study. Anatomic success was achieved in 69. 6 % of patients. Morphologic criteria including the position and number of breaks, position and extent of lattice degeneration, size of the detached area, and macular status were all found not to be significantly related to failure. In multivariate analysis, only 3 predictors, pseudophakic status (p < 0. 05, odds ratio [OR] 2. 9, 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 7. 88), presence of retinal break greater than 1 clock-hour (p < 0. 05, OR 3. 41, 1. 06 - 11. 02), and presence of grade C or D proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) (p < 0. 01, OR 31. 83, 95 % CI, 3. 59 - 282. 24), gained statistical significance. Conclusions: Only pseudophakia, a large retinal break, and/or PVR was associated with an increased likelihood of failure. © 2013 <b>Canadian</b> <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>Society.</b> All rights reserved.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{performance}} characteristics of hand-activated surgical tools {{with those of}} foot-activated surgical tools using a virtual-reality simulator of intraocular surgery. Design: Prospective, unmasked, interventional cohort study. Participants: Eighteen ophthalmology residents at the University of Toronto. Methods: The EYESi ophthalmic surgery simulator {{was used for the}} study. The surgical tool evaluated was a simulation of intraocular forceps activated by either a handpiece or a foot pedal. Each resident completed 2 modules - a dexterity module and a capsulorrhexis/ cataract module. Each module was completed 4 times, alternating between the hand-activated forceps and the foot-activated forceps. An overall score was calculated for each task {{on the basis of the}} efficiency and accuracy of completion of the task, with 100 representing a perfect score. Overall scores were compared between hand and foot control for both modules. Results: For the dexterity module, there was no significant difference in the overall scores between the 2 groups (91 ± 6 and 93 ± 6 for the foot- and hand-activated forceps groups, respectively; p > 0. 05, t test). For the capsulorrhexis module, overall scores were also similar for both groups, the scores being 50 ± 21 and 53 ± 16 for the foot- and hand-activated forceps groups, respectively (p > 0. 05, t test). An exit survey of the study's participants revealed that subjects did not have a preference for the hand or foot modality of the forceps tool, with 10 preferring the hand-activated forceps tool and 8 preferring the foot-activated tool. Conclusions: During simulated intraocular surgery, foot- and hand-activated surgical tools appear to have similar performance characteristics and are equally well received by residents. © 2012 <b>Canadian</b> <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>Society.</b> Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the correlation between}} tear osmolarity and blood levels of 17 -β estradiol, estrone, and testosterone in postmenopausal women with dry eye syndrome, and to assess the efficacy and safety of oral supplementation with phytoestrogens, lipoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid in this population. Cross-sectional study including 66 postmenopausal women with dry eye syndrome. Sixty-six postmenopausal women with dry eye syndrome were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Patients were divided into 2 groups (groups A and B) and treated, respectively, with phytoestrogen (Bioos, Montegiorgio, Italy) tablets or placebo tablets for 30 days. The 2 treatment periods were separated by a 30 -day washout. Patients were examined on days 0 and 30 of each period. Assessments included blood levels of sex hormones, the Schirmer test for tear production, and measurement of tear osmolarity and tear film break-up time. At baseline, all patients had low sex hormone levels, which were correlated with high tear film osmolarity values (r = - 0. 59,- 0. 61,- 0. 58, respectively). After 30 days of therapy, the group treated with Lacrisek® (Bioos) had significantly decreased tear osmolarity (P< 0. 005) and significantly increased tear production evaluated with the Schirmer test and tear film break-up time values (P< 0. 001) compared with the placebo-treated group. Our study confirms that steroid hormones {{play an important role}} in ocular surface equilibrium and functions. Consequently, reduced blood levels of these hormones can produce changes at the ocular surface. Phytoestrogen supplementation can significantly improve the signs and symptoms of dry eye syndrome in postmenopausal women.

40|$|Objective: To compare {{performance}} on the Eyesi surgical simulator by users with different levels of experience in ophthalmology. Design: Multicentre cross-sectional study. Participants: Four medical students, 4 ophthalmic medical technologist trainees, 36 ophthalmology residents, 3 fellows, and 18 staff ophthalmologists. Methods: Subjects were recruited at the 2007 <b>Canadian</b> <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>Society</b> Meeting and in the departments of ophthalmology at the University of Toronto, University of Ottawa, and University of Western Ontario. Subjects performed a standardized 20 -minute session on the Eyesi simulator. The protocol consisted of a practice trial in the anterior segment module, followed by 3 scored trials in the anterior forceps, antitremor, and capsulorhexis modules. Results: In the forceps module, participants with greater experience achieved significantly higher total scores {{than those who were}} less experienced: staff ophthalmologists (Group D) = 67. 9 (SD 18. 4), senior residents and fellows (Group C) = 67. 6 (SD 21. 1), junior residents (Group B) = 52. 9 (SD 29. 4), medical students and ophthalmic medical technologist trainees (Group A) = 27. 8 (SD 29. 4) (p = 0. 011), with lower total task time (p = 0. 044) and fewer injuries to the cornea (p = 0. 001) and lens (p = 0. 026). In the antitremor module, subjects in Group D achieved significantly higher (p = 0. 004) total scores (46. 7, SD 21. 6) than Groups C (45. 8, SD 25. 1), B (41. 2, SD 29. 4), and A (8. 5, SD 9. 2) with lower total task time (p = 0. 005) and fewer errors (p = 0. 003). In the capsulorhexis module there was also a positive correlation between experience and total scores achieved (p = 0. 065). Conclusions: Subjects' level of training is a reliable predictor of their {{performance on}} the Eyesi anterior forceps and antitremor modules (p < 0. 05), indicating the modules' construct validity.

40|$|Objective: To compare static (during a pure {{fixation}} task) versus dynamic (during microperimetry) quantification of fixation stability using microperimetry {{in normal}} and pathologic eyes, {{by means of}} 2 available (clinical and bivariate contour ellipse area [BCEA]) classification methods. Design: Prospective comparative observational study. Participants: One hundred and forty-nine eyes (110 patients) with different macular diseases and 171 normal eyes (109 subjects). Methods: In all eyes studied, fixation stability was acquired during an isolated fixation task (static fixation) and during microperimetry (dynamic fixation). All fixation data were analyzed and compared {{by means of a}} clinical classification and by means of BCEA quantification. Results: Pathologic eyes were classified as follows: 41 eyes with diabetic macular edema (DME group), 13 eyes with vitreoretinal interface disease, 60 eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD group), and 35 eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma. Fixation stability was not uniform among groups according to clinical classification in both static and dynamic modalities (p < 0. 0001). AMD group showed larger BCEA areas compared with all other groups (p < 0. 0001). All pathologic groups showed more unstable fixation in dynamic fashion according to both clinical and BCEA methods (p < 0. 0001). The variation of fixation stability of control group in dynamic task was highlighted only by BCEA analysis (p < 0. 0001). A deterioration of retinal fixation according to clinical method matches a significant increase in BCEA areas (p < 0. 0001). Conclusions: The detection of clinical fixation stability changes improves when acquired in the dynamic modality. BCEA analysis provides more accurate evaluation of fixation stability and may detect minimal quantitative changes of the fixation area. However, a standard clinical classification can also detect changes in fixation stability in pathologic eyes. Both methods are useful tools in the evaluation of fixation stability. © 2013 <b>Canadian</b> <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>Society.</b> Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{present the}} {{characteristics}} and outcomes of macular holes (MHs) {{that arise in}} eyes that have been treated for retinal detachment (RD). Design: Retrospective, interventional, consecutive case series. Participants: We studied 18 eyes that developed a MH following RD repair. Methods: We report the demographic and clinical characteristics, MH closure rates, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) following MH repair. Results: We detected 18 full-thickness MHs in 985 eyes. In 14 of 18, the original RD involved the macula, and in 16 of 18, the BCVA was 20 / 200 or worse. Of the RDs, 8 of 18 required multiple procedures to achieve reattachment. Post-RD BCVA was 20 / 200 or worse in 15 of 18 patients. The median time to MH diagnosis after RD repair was 1 month (range, 2 days to 53 months), and from MH diagnosis to MH repair, the median time was 1. 75 months (range, 3 weeks to 8 months). Of 16 eyes (89 %) that underwent surgical repair of the MH, 14 achieved MH closure, 1 requiring multiple pars plana vitrectomy, and 11 saw at least 1 Snellen line of improvement (median, 1; range, 1 to 6); 2 lost vision (1 and 2 Snellen lines, respectively); and 3 remained unchanged at a median follow-up of 3 months (range, 1 month to 25 months). Of the 18 patients, 6 had at least 20 / 80 BCVA at last follow-up. Conclusions: MHs following RDs (incidence 1. 9 %) {{are likely to be}} macula-off RDs requiring multiple interventions for RD repair. Post-MH-repair closure rates are similar to the rates for idiopathic MHs. BCVA outcomes are moderate and are dependent on impairment post-RD repair. The findings suggest other pathogenic mechanisms besides vitreofoveal traction may be leading to these MHs. © 2012 <b>Canadian</b> <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>Society.</b> Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To analyze {{correlation}} among microperimetry, {{inner and}} outer retinal layers, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) changes in eyes with progressing geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration. Methods: Microperimetry, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), standard short-wavelength FAF (SW-FAF), and near-infrared-wavelength FAF (NIR-FAF) were performed for all patients at both baseline and follow-up visits. FAF pattern, integrity of photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction, total retinal thickness (RT), inner retinal layers (IRL), and outer retinal layers (ORL) thickness changes of every microperimetry extrafoveal tested point were analyzed. Results: A total of 366 microperimetry tested points were analyzed (6 patients, 7 eyes). Mean retinal sensitivity significantly decreased (p = 0. 0149), {{and the percentage of}} dense scotomas significantly increased (p = 0. 0125). Mean RT and mean ORL thickness significantly decreased (both p < 0. 0001). Mean IRL thickness significantly increased (p = 0. 0001). The decrease of ORL thickness was inversely correlated to the IRL thinning (rho = - 0. 710). FAF pattern at baseline was correlated to RTand ORL thickness (both p < 0. 0001) and was significantly correlated to the risk to evolve to dense scotoma during follow-up (p = 0. 0001 at SW-FAF, p < 0. 0001 at NIR-FAF). Tested points showing at baseline the loss of photoreceptor IS/OS junction had a greater risk for evolving to dense scotoma compared with those with intact photoreceptor IS/OS junction (odds ratio 3. 56, 95 % CI 2. 41 - 5. 27). Conclusions: Retinal sensitivity changes are correlated to IRL and ORL thickness changes, and to photoreceptor IS/OS junction integrity. FAF patterns remain a relevant factor in predicting GA evolution. Microperimetry, SW-FAF and NIR-FAF, and SD-OCT should be combined to obtain adequate morphologic and functional prospective information. © 2013 <b>Canadian</b> <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>Society.</b> Published by Elsevier Inc.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} the MP- 1 microperimeter (Nidek Technologies Srl, Padova, Italy) and Visual Pathfinder (LACE Inc) in improving visual function of patients with myopic maculopathy. Prospective, nonrandomized, interventional case series. Seventeen patients (34 eyes) between 36 and 58 years of age with myopic maculopathy and central retinal scotomas. After a complete eye examination, all patients underwent 10 training sessions with MP- 1 biofeedback (7 minutes) and Visual Pathfinder (3 minutes) for each eye once a week. Statistical analysis was performed with Student t test. The p values less than 0. 05 were considered statistically significant. The mean best corrected visual acuity increased from 0. 64 ± 0. 22 to 0. 38 ± 0. 20 logMAR at the end of follow-up (p = 0. 03); visual-evoked potential P 100 amplitude increased from 3. 54 ± 1. 90 to 6. 64 ± 2. 91 μV at the end of follow-up (p = 0. 04); average retinal sensitivity, calculated in the 12 degrees of the central retina, increased from 6. 6 ± 2. 6 to 14. 6 ± 3. 6 dB (p = 0. 03). Fixation behaviour in the 2 degrees of the central retina increased from 45 % ± 17 % to 75 % ± 23 % (p = 0. 04). The bivariate contour ellipse area (95 %) increased from 10. 34 ± 3. 11 to 7. 64 ± 2. 71 square degrees (p = 0. 04). The combination of acoustic biofeedback training with MP- 1 and Visual Pathfinder offers a reasonable improvement of visual function in patients with myopic maculopathy. This method might be considered as a rehabilitative strategy as a "therapeutic option" in these patients for whom most treatments usually do not work. © 2013 <b>Canadian</b> <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>Society.</b> Published by Elsevier Inc.
