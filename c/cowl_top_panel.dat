25|$|Breda-proposed {{modification}} with a Piaggio P.XIX R.C.45 engine producing 880kW (1,180hp) at 4,500m (14,800ft). Converted from {{an early}} production C.200: first flight 11 April 1942 from Milano-Bresso flown by Luigi Acerbi. The aircraft was then fitted with a larger propeller and a revised engine <b>cowling.</b> <b>Top</b> speed in trials was 535km/h (332mph). It did not enter production as the C.200 {{had been replaced by}} more advanced designs.|$|R
40|$|A {{skateboard}} {{that includes}} a storage compartment. The deck of the skateboard forms a storage compartment and includes a bottom panel, a sidewall, and a <b>top</b> <b>panel.</b> The sidewall extends upwardly from, and is disposed along, {{the periphery of the}} bottom <b>panel.</b> The <b>top</b> <b>panel</b> is hingedly connected to the sidewall and opens and closes to form a storage compartment in conjunction with the sidewall and bottom panel. A latch is used to securely fasten the <b>top</b> <b>panel</b> in the closed position. A handle is provided to carry the skateboard like a suitcase...|$|R
40|$|Various {{apparatuses}} {{and methods}} are provided {{for measuring the}} likely environmental impact of a particular geographic location on power generation properties of potential solar installations at the particular location. In an example embodiment of one such apparatus, a measurement device is provided. The measurement device includes a base portion comprising a base frame element disposed on a plurality of supporting legs, and a <b>top</b> <b>panel</b> comprising a series of connected members and one or more measurement modules whose planar dimensions are defined by the series of connected members. The <b>top</b> <b>panel</b> {{is connected to the}} base portion by a joint such that the <b>top</b> <b>panel</b> can rotate about the joint, and a panel support element is configured to fasten the <b>top</b> <b>panel</b> immovably at a desired degree of rotation in relation to the base portion...|$|R
30|$|Interesting {{features}} are increases in amplitudes of 4 -day westward NAM in both hemispheres in the <b>top</b> <b>panel</b> of Fig.  4 b at altitudes above 70 km. Considerations of the <b>top</b> <b>panel</b> of Fig.  6 b reveal substantial increases in EP-fluxes directed at these altitudes across the equator {{from the northern}} to the southern hemisphere produced by OGW effects for this mode. Combined with waveguides existing for 4 -day westward NAM in the southern hemisphere in Fig.  6 a, such increases in EP-fluxes can produce respective increases in amplitudes of this mode at high altitudes in the <b>top</b> <b>panel</b> of Fig.  4 b.|$|R

50|$|The 2006 Mitsubishi Pajero {{utilizes}} built-in frame {{monocoque body}} with crumple zones around {{the engine to}} absorb impact energy. Measures taken to boost body stiffness include more spot welds, a stiffer <b>cowl</b> <b>top,</b> switching from 270 MPa grade to 440 MPa grade high tensile strength steel, and the strategic use of structural adhesives. It features stiffer body joins and use of more plated steel sheet for improved durability and reliability. Switching to aluminum has lowered {{the weight of the}} engine hood by approximately 9 kg.|$|R
