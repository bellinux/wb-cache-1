25|$|FETs {{often have}} a very low 'on' {{resistance}} and have a high 'off' resistance. However the intermediate resistances are significant, and so FETs can dissipate large amounts of power while switching. Thus efficiency <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> premium on switching quickly, but this can cause transients that can excite stray inductances and generate significant voltages that can couple to the gate and cause unintentional switching. FET circuits can therefore require very careful layout and can involve trades between switching speed and power dissipation. There is also a trade-off between voltage rating and 'on' resistance, so high voltage FETs have a relatively high 'on' resistance and hence conduction losses.|$|E

Aviation historian Alan Stephens {{has written that}} they were [...] "the preeminent weapons system in the Asia-Pacific region" [...] throughout their service and provided Australia with [...] "a genuine, independent strike capability". Stewart Wilson, in his book Lincoln, Canberra and F-111 in Australian Service, described the F-111C as [...] "an unqualified success..., providing Australia with a potent strike capability in an aircraft which, a quarter of century after its first flight remains second to none."

500|$|In {{a global}} context, {{popularity}} can vary widely by territory, {{especially with regard}} to limited releases. [...] Mad Max (1979) was an international hit â€“ except in America where it became an obscure cult favorite, ignored by critics and available for years only in a dubbed version though it earned over $100M internationally. [...] Foreign cinema <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> different spin on popular genres, such as Japanese horror, which was initially a cult favorite in America. [...] Asian imports to the West are often marketed as exotic cult films and of interchangeable national identity, which academic Chi-Yun Shin criticizes as reductive. [...] Foreign influence can affect fan response, especially on genres tied to a national identity; when they become more global in scope, questions of authenticity may arise. [...] Filmmakers and films ignored in their own country can become the objects of cult adoration in another, producing perplexed reactions in their native country. [...] Cult films can also establish an early viability for more mainstream films both for filmmakers and national cinema. [...] The early cult horror films of Peter Jackson were so strongly associated with his homeland that they affected the international reputation of New Zealand and its cinema. [...] As more artistic films emerged, New Zealand was perceived as a legitimate competitor to Hollywood, which mirrored Jackson's career trajectory. [...] Heavenly Creatures (1994) acquired its own cult following, became a part of New Zealand's national identity, and paved the way for big-budget, Hollywood-style epics, such as Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.|$|E

2500|$|Antichrist {{started with}} the idea of making a horror film. Trier {{thought it was a good}} idea to start with a certain genre, and chose horror cinema because [...] "the genre [...] that you <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> lot of very, very strange images in a horror film". He had {{recently}} seen several contemporary Japanese horror films such as Ring and Dark Water, from which he drew inspiration. Another basic idea came from a documentary Trier saw about the original forests of Europe. In the documentary the forests were portrayed as a place of great pain and suffering as the different species tried to kill and eat each other. Trier was fascinated by the contrast between this and the view of nature as a romantic and peaceful place. Trier said: [...] "At the same time that we hang it on our walls over the fireplace or whatever, it represents pure Hell." [...] In retrospect he said that he had become unsure whether Antichrist really could be classified as a horror film, because [...] "it's not so horrific ... we didn't try so hard to do shocks, and that is maybe why it is not a horror film. I took [...] more as an inspiration, and then this strange story came out of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "an extravagant and witty follow-up, {{made with the}} same {{friendly}} virtuosic dazzleâ€¦ and just obligatory enough {{to be too much}} of a good thing." [...] He cautioned that [...] "this time you can sense just how hard [...] is working to entertain you. Maybe a little too hard." [...] Mike Ryan at Uproxx noted the continued sense of humor and tone from the first film, and appreciated Gunn's difference in overall structure in the sequel (which he compared to The Empire Strikes Back). Ryan was positive of the cast, particularly Rooker in his expanded role as [...] "the heart" [...] of the film. Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers called the film a [...] "blast" [...] and gave it three stars out of four, praising the film for its tone and fun, soundtrack, and characters. He noted that [...] "Vol. 2 can't match the sneak-attack surprise of its predecessorâ€¦ the followup, while taking on some CGI bloat and sequel slickness, hasn't lost its love for inspired lunacy. Chicago Sun-Timess Richard Roeper also gave the film three stars, writing, [...] "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn't quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the originalâ€”but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch." [...] Roeper continued that [...] "even with all the silliness and all the snarkiness, the Guardians <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> lump in your throat", and praised the cast, especially Rooker, with [...] "one of the best roles in the movie".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{positive}} review {{centering on}} the science fiction elements of the film was relayed by Janet Maslin of The New York Times. She praised the theme saying, [...] "Alien Nation has the best science-fiction idea this side of The Terminator." [...] However, Maslin was quick to admit the film [...] "settles down, with remarkable ease, into the routine of a two-cop buddy film, extraterrestrials and all. Matthew and Sam (whom Matthew refuses to address that way, renaming him George) {{go through all the}} familiar stages of forging a friendship between partners: cool antipathy, exchanges of insults, growing mutual respect on the job and, finally, an all-night drinking binge to solidify their buddyhood." [...] On a negative front, author Jay Carr of The Boston Globe commented on James Caan's performance viewing him [...] "Looking like a Paul Newman gone wrong, ..." [...] He went on further stating that [...] "the film's air of enlightenment is only makeup deep. And while [...] 'Alien Nation' [...] is no smarter than, say, a [...] 'Lethal Weapon' , it hasn't got the juice or the level of sensory jolt a [...] 'Lethal Weapon' [...] supplies." [...] Other critics such as Gene Siskel acknowledged the similarities between other police thriller movies, but still found the film to be a [...] "Genuinely entertaining version of that old reliable; a cop buddy picture with two very different detectives." [...] He explained, [...] "Now {{this is an example of}} how a you <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> nice twist on a familiar story, and it will work if it's been fully written. Caan and Patinkin have special characters to play." [...] Compelled by the acting, he felt [...] "The buddy combination here, worked for me." [...] He ultimately gave the film a [...] "Thumbs Up" [...] review. Not nearly as impressed with the film was author NF of TimeOut Magazine calling it, [...] "Worthy, predictable, and dull." [...] A summation of the negativity was described as being, [...] "Played hard and fast, the film might just have worked, but the decision to soft-pedal the violence merely emphasises the obviousness of the liberal point-scoring (parallels with Vietnamese or Nicaraguan refugees are so facile as to be crass)." [...] Critic Leonard Maltin bluntly referred to the film as [...] "A great concept that doesn't quite pay off." [...] But in a hint of commendation, he remarked how the film contains [...] "many clever touches and terrific performances by Caan and Patinkin." ...|$|E
