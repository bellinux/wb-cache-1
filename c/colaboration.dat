40|$|In {{the unified}} subquark model of all {{fundamental}} particles and forces, {{the mass of}} the Higgs boson in the standard model of electroweak interactions (m_H) is predicted to be about 2 √(6) m_W/ 3 (where m_W is {{the mass of the}} charged weak boson), which agrees well with the experimental values of 125 - 126 GeV recently found by the ATLAS and CMS <b>Colaborations</b> at the LHC. It seems to indicate that the Higgs boson is a composite of the iso-doublet subquark-antisubquark pairs well described by the unified subquark model with either one of subquark masses vanishing or being very small compared to the other.

40|$|Rapidly growing {{mycobacteria}} (RGM) are opportunistic microorganisms {{and widely}} distributed into aqueous environment and soil. Human RGM infections are {{usually associated with}} contaminated solutions or medical instruments used during invasive procedures. RGM postsurgical infections have recently emerged in Brazil and have caused national alert, considering the risk factors and epidemiological aspects. This study aimed at analysing the main factors linked to the recent RGM outbreaks, with focus on the national epidemic of Mycobacterium massiliense infections related to the BRA 100 strains resistant to 2 % glutaraldehyde commercial solutions commonly used for preoperative high-level disinfection. Based on previous studies and laboratorial results of assays and <b>colaborations,</b> {{it has been observed}} that the cases have been associated with videolaparoscopy for different applications and elective esthetic procedures, such as lipoaspiration and mammary prosthesis implant. Furthermore, outbreaks between 2004 and 2008 and the epidemic in Rio de Janeiro state may be considered particular Brazilian events. Although there are a few epidemiological published studies, some hypotheses based on common aspects related to most national nosocomial occurrences are possible, such as lack of protocols for cleaning and high-level disinfection, use of 2 % glutaraldehyde as high-level disinfectant for surgical instruments, and dissemination of M. massiliense BRA 100 by unknown mechanisms...|$|R

50|$|In 1913, Zenobia kept an epistolary {{relationship}} with her North American suitor Henry Shattuck, who came to Spain in May to discuss details about a possible marriage. The 9th of July, through a letter, the relation splits up to start being friends.She assisted many conferences, but she could only do so if she was accompanied by an American couple, the Byne. This couple organized parties and in them, she heard about a fierce and strange poet hosted in the residence, who complainted about the noise but sticked his ear to the wall when he heard Zenobia's laugh, who he didn’t know yet. Zenobia met Juan Ramón Jiménez in 1913, in a conference imparted by Bartolomé Cossío, celebrated in the Residence where he worked.In 1914, Zenobia translated some verses from The Crescent Moon by Tagore, including a prologue-poem by Juan Ramón. In June she visited Ávila y Segovia. By {{the end of the}} year, there were some disagreements between Juan Ramón and Zenobia. They couldn’t deliver La Luna Nueva by Tagore on time for its publication, and to compensate this problem they published the children edition of Platero y yo.In December, Zenobia and her mother boarded in Cádiz on their way to New York, to avoid the relationship of her daughter with the poet. But, on 12th February 1916 the poet Juan Ramón Jiménez arrived to New York and on the 2nd of March Zenobia and him got married in the Catholic Church St. Stephen of New York. They travelled around the United States: Boston, Philadelfia, Baltimore, Washington… On the 7th of June they boarded on the ship “Montevideo”, accompanied by Mrs. Isabel Aymar, destination Spain. After landing in Cádiz they arrived to Sevilla, where they spent a couple of days, on their way to La Palma del Condado, where they were expected by Juan Ramón's relatives, who wanted to know his wife at last. On the 1st of July they arrived to Madrid.In 1917, Zenobia translated and published El Jardinero, El Cartero del Rey, Pájaros perdidos and La Cosecha by Tagore. Juan Ramón Jiménez added a prologue-poem to them. Also in <b>colaboration</b> with Juan Ramón, she translated El Asceta, El rey y la Reina, Malini, Ofrenda Lírica, Las Piedras Hambrientas and Ciclo de Primavera, all of them by Tagore.|$|E

The purpose of this research is to identify the characteristics of a new product of organic spinach puree; analyze consumer preference; and formulate marketing strategies on the new product of organic spinach puree. In this research, the analysis performed includes descriptive analysis; conjoint analysis to know consumer preference consisting of packaging and flavors; and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to formulate marketing strategy for the new product of organic spinach puree. The result showed that as many as 96 respondents of 100 total respondents used as the sample claimed to be interested in the new product. The analysis result of consumer preference using conjoint analysis show that the packaging is the most important attribute for consumer to make purchasing decision. For the best combination of choice attributes is organic spinach puree with melon flavors and packaging in sachet.
