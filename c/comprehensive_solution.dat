25|$|The {{government}} could start by securing our nation's borders. A sovereign nation that can't {{do that is}} not a sovereign nation. This is secondarily an immigration issue.

Twelve million illegals later, we're being told that same thing again.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that Surrey may 'drop its opposition' after BAA offered to fund £11 million of transport improvements and a vote to provisionally drop their opposition was passed by the county's cabinet on 28 September 2010. This decision was due to be finalised by the full council in December 2010 but was deferred. The move was the subject of an 'extraordinary outburst' from Philip Hammond, the local MP, who at the time happened to be the Secretary of State for Transport. Hammond criticised the council for 'grabbing a bribe', a payment of £11 million towards mitigating some traffic problems in Egham entirely unconnected to Airtrack and went on to demand a more <b>comprehensive</b> <b>solution,</b> saying 'no solution, no scheme' and urging BAA to 'get back to the drawing board'. BAA had made a significant compromise in offering this payment as it had previously been consistent in arguing that traffic problems caused by Airtrack were not its responsibility, using the fact that Network Rail has no legal obligation to open level crossings at all or to consult on changes.|$|E

500|$|Computer chess {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} domains of {{artificial}} intelligence, having begun in the early 1930s. [...] Claude Shannon proposed formal criteria for evaluating chess moves in 1949. [...] In 1951, Alan Turing designed a primitive chess playing program, which assigned values for material and mobility; the program [...] "played" [...] chess based on Turing's manual calculations. [...] However, even as competent chess programs began to develop, they exhibited a glaring weakness in playing the endgame. [...] Programmers added specific heuristics for the endgame – for example, the king should move to the center of the board. [...] However, a more <b>comprehensive</b> <b>solution</b> was needed.|$|E
500|$|The most {{controversial}} upgrade of the A303 has been improvement {{to the road}} through the Stonehenge World Heritage Site, where it remains a congested single carriageway road. There were minor improvements in the 1960s, including closing the road for a month in 1967 for levelling and resurfacing. A proposal to fully dual the A303 past Stonehenge was announced in the mid-1970s, but was criticised as being [...] "an environmental disaster" [...] and comparable to driving a dual carriageway through Westminster Abbey. A more <b>comprehensive</b> <b>solution</b> was discussed in 1989's Roads for Prosperity programme, which included upgrading the road to dual carriageway and bypassing Winterborne Stoke. In 1993, the Minister for Roads, Kenneth Carlisle, announced plans for either a [...] tunnel or a diversion of the A303 a mile from Stonehenge, costing £44 million and £22 million respectively. Although the new Labour government cancelled many road schemes after coming to power in 1997, there was still general support for a tunnel at Stonehenge.|$|E

2500|$|State Route 167 then {{continues}} north {{passing through the}} city of Kent before reaching Interstate 405 in Renton.

In April 1981, Assistant Secretary of State Crocker was dispatched to Africa on a two-week, eleven-nation tour {{to lay the groundwork}} for the new policy. However, Crocker was met with distrust on one side [...] the black leaders wary of the Reagan administration's friendly approach towards the white-minority government in South Africa [...] and hostility from the other, with prime minister P. W. Botha refusing to meet with him. Undeterred, Crocker continued to insist that a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>solution</b> was the only way to allay the fears on both sides.
