He then went to Martínez' shop {{to tell her the}} teenager was dead. She told Garza that she would not give him the money unless there was solid proof that Fischer was dead. Garza then talked with Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña at the motel room. A few hours after the murder, Martínez phoned Cisneros and told her that the job had been carried out. Cisneros arrived at her store minutes later and left a sealed envelope with the money. Cisneros then went to St. Joe and picked up her daughter from school. Later that evening, Garza and Puentes Pizaña met with Martínez and picked up the envelope. They headed back to the motel and Garza handed over the envelope to Olivarez. Garza claims that the hitmen received $3,500, though he stated he never counted the money. Martínez said she did and that it was $3,000. Investigators believe it could have been as much as $5,000. Garza was then picked up by his nephew from Matamoros and taken to the Harlingen airport, where he flew back to San Antonio. On his way to the airport, he passed through Rancho Viejo and recalled seeing police cars and a house cordoned off with yellow tape.|$|E

The move came as Fox aggressively sought a higher share of retransmission earnings gained by its affiliates as part of affiliation agreements, an approach that openly irked WTVW owner Nexstar. Nexstar would subsequently be stripped of its Fox affiliations in Springfield, Missouri (KSFX-TV) and Fort Wayne (WFFT-TV) as well, and Nexstar decided to drop the Fox affiliation from its Terre Haute affiliate (WFXW), which would regain its former ABC affiliation under the new callsign WAWV-TV.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Cryptotanshinone (CTs) {{is a major}} active {{component}} of Salvia miltiorrhiza, which is often used as Chinese herbal medicine in cancer therapy. Here, we systematically assessed the anti-tumor effect of <b>CTs</b> <b>on</b> two melanoma cell lines with low/high metastatic capacity (B 16 /B 16 BL 6). Experimental Approach: MTT and LDH assays were used to evaluate cell growth and cytotoxicity. We assessed the effect of <b>CTs</b> <b>on</b> cell apoptosis or proliferation by Annexin V, TUNEL or BrdU assay. Cell cycle distribution was detected by flow cytometry. The integrity of cell cycle checkpoints was determined by mutational analyses of B-RAF and N-RAS, and the expression of cell cycle associated proteins by western blotting. Key Results: Treatment with CTs had no obvious effect on cell apoptosis, but significantly inhibited cell proliferation. CTs induced the expression of p 53, Chk 1 and Chk 2 in both B 16 and B 16 BL 6. Interestingly, CTs induced G 1 arrest in B 16 BL 6 cells, together {{with an increase in}} protein levels of p 21. By contrast, in B 16 cells, CTs induced the G 2 /M arrest through induction of Cdc 25 c. Regulation of Cyclin A 1, Cyclin B 1 and Cdk 1 /cdc 2 expression level might contribute to the different cell cycle patterns in B 16 and B 16 BL 6 after CTs treatment. 2 Conclusions and Implications: CTs could have opposite effects on cell cycle events in melanoma cell lines with different metastatic capacity. This property might offer an opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying the different anti-tumor effects of <b>CTs</b> <b>on</b> B 16 and B 16 BL 6...|$|R

2500|$|The Price Is Right premiered on September 4, 1972 at 10:30am ET (9:30 <b>CT)</b> <b>on</b> CBS, one {{of three}} game shows to debut that day, the other two being The Joker's Wild at 10:00am ET and Gambit at 11:00am ET. The show was first billed as The New Price Is Right to {{distinguish}} itself from the earlier/original version (1956–65) hosted by Bill Cullen, but it proved so popular {{in its own right}} that, in June 1973, the producers decided to drop the word [...] "New" [...] from its title. On March 26, 1973, CBS moved The Price Is Right to 3:00pm ET, pairing it with Match Game as part of what became the highest-rated pairing in daytime. The show remained in that time slot until August 11, 1975 when it permanently returned to the morning lineup at 10:30am ET. During one week (September 8–12, 1975), the show bumped Gambit off as it experimented with sixty-minute episodes. The result of the experiment led to the permanent expansion on November 3, 1975, moving its start time to 10:00am EST. On March 7, 1977, The Price Is Right moved back to 10:30am and remained there until April 23, 1979, when it assumed its 11:00am EST slot, where it has been since then. The format of the show has since remained virtually unchanged. New pricing games are generally added each year, while others are removed. In addition, prizes and pricing games have kept pace with inflation, with games originally designed for four-digit prices of prizes (most often cars) to be adjusted to allow for five-digit prices. While the set has been redesigned and upgraded, the show maintained a similar aesthetic element from its premiere in 1972. In season 36, CBS began offering full episodes of the show available for free viewing on the network's website. The show also began broadcasting in high definition with The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular primetime specials (the normal daytime version continued to air in [...] standard definition). The show made the full transition to HD broadcasts beginning with season 37. During the weeks of September 28, 2009, September 20 and October 4, 2010, two new episodes aired each weekday on CBS. In 2009, the additional episodes filled a gap between the cancellation of the daytime drama Guiding Light and the debut of Let's Make a Deal. In 2010, the extra episodes aired between the cancellation of As the World Turns and the debut of The Talk. The intervening week offered a second episode of Let's Make a Deal. The 2009 second episode aired in the time slot vacated by Guiding Light at 10:00am or 3:00pm ET/PT, depending on the affiliate's choice. In 2010, the second episode aired in the former As the World Turns time slot, at 2:00pm ET/PT.|$|E

40|$|Fab {{operations}} management strives to decrease cycle-time (CT) for driving low inventory, improved qual-ity, short time-to-market and lower cost. This work studies {{factors contributing to}} production variability, and evaluates the variability's influence <b>on</b> <b>CT.</b> It relies <b>on</b> queueing networks, <b>CT</b> and variability approx-imations, operational curve modeling, and common practice. It demonstrates that increasing variability drives longer CT at a growing pace, and has a larger effect <b>on</b> <b>CT</b> than utilization. Growing machine in-ventory weakens the impact of utilization <b>on</b> <b>CT</b> and almost eliminates it at high inventory, while the im-pact of variability <b>on</b> <b>CT</b> remains significant. Decline of machine availability prolongs CT at a growing pace, and is affected by variability more than utilization. Overall the primary factor of production varia-bility is attributed to machine availability, and specifically to repair time. Reducing variability for achiev-ing decreased CT is less costly and more effective than reducing machine utilization or increasing capaci-ty. ...|$|R
