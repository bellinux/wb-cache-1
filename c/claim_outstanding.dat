2500|$|In 1515 Sittow {{was again}} in Spain, {{this time to}} <b>claim</b> <b>outstanding</b> debts {{incurred}} by Isabella of Castile, and {{it is significant that}} in the documentation for his claim he is referred to as 'pintor criado de madama la prinçesa doña Margarita', that is the painter of Margaret of Austria. It seems likely that this was the case at least a year earlier. In 1514 Sittow visited Copenhagen, to paint the portrait of Christian II of Denmark. The portrait was part of the diplomacy for the betrothal of Christian II to Margaret's niece Isabella of Austria. The portrait that is held in Copenhagen's Statens Museum for Kunst is probably a copy of a lost original or a second copy ordered from Sittow.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> {{liability}} is {{the insurance}} companies’ corporate responsibility towards future debt. There {{are a number}} of existing models used to estimate the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability for long tail business. However, some of the assumptions imposed on these models are not met by the claims data under consideration. Furthermore, trends in the development year and payment year periods are not taken into account by these models. The Probabilistic Trend Family (PTF) model is developed to overcome these problems. In this paper, PTF model is described; and the process of estimating the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability, starting from the preliminary analysis of the claims data to the estimation of the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability is explained. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the obtained estimate of the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability is analyzed using a tool called leverage. Leverage can be used to evaluate the robustness of the model used to estimate the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability. Keywords : <b>Outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability, long tail business, development year period, payment year period, probabilistic trend family, sensitivity, leverage. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{prediction}} {{of the amount of}} <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> that an insurance company will pay in the near future. We consider various competing models using Bayesian theory and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Claim counts are used in order to add a further hierarchical stage in the usual log-normal and statespace models. By this way, we incorporate information from both the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claim</b> amounts and counts data resulting to new model formulations. We provide implementation details and illustrations with real insurance data. Keywords: Log-normal model; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Missing values; Multinomial model; State space models. 1 Introduction Insurance companies often do not pay the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> as soon as they occur. Instead, claims are settled with a time delay which may be years or, in some extreme cases, decades. Reserving for <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> is of central interest in actuarial practice and has attracted the attention of many researchers because of [...] ...|$|R
50|$|A hire {{purchase}} agreement, {{also known as}} an instalment sale, allows the purchase {{price to be paid}} in instalments after delivery of the hired property. Ownership remains with the seller until the hirer has paid the last hire instalment. The seller’s tacit hypothec is triggered by the sequestration of the hirer. The seller has a secured <b>claim</b> to the <b>outstanding</b> instalments due in terms of the {{hire purchase}} agreement. The seller’s hypothec under a hire purchase agreement secures the seller’s <b>claim</b> to <b>outstanding</b> instalments, so that the seller has a preferential claim.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} use of asset-backed money in a neoclassical growth model with {{illiquid}} capital. A mechanism is delegated control of productive capi- tal and issues claims against the revenue it earns. These claims constitute a form of asset-backed money. The mechanism determines (i) the number of <b>claims</b> <b>outstanding,</b> (ii) the dividends paid to claim holders, and (iii) the structure of redemption fees. We find that for capital-rich economies, the first-best allocation can be implemented and price stability is optimal. However, for sufficiently capital-poor economies, achieving the first-best allocation requires a strictly positive rate of inflation. In general, the minimum infiation necessary to implement the first-best allocation is above the Friedman rule and varies with capital wealth...|$|R

50|$|In April 1760, the Jamaican {{government}} {{called upon}} the maroons to honor their treaties {{and come to}} their assistance during the major slave uprising led by the Fante leader, Tacky. The Windward Maroons were first to be mobilized. Their intervention often appeared half-hearted: the Scott's Hall Maroons began by <b>claiming</b> <b>outstanding</b> arrears in bounty, while those of Down's Cove simply took cover when attacked by the rebels. In the end, it was a Scott's Hall Maroon, Lieutenant Davy, who killed Tacky during a skirmish. Although the loss of Tacky's leadership essentially ended the rebellion, by October, related uprisings broke out on the leeward side of the island. Cudjoe's well-trained forces were also mobilized to help deal with them, apparently to good effect.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> produced by a homogeneous general insurance portfolio. The specific model considered in this paper is one where the number of claims in any loss period follows a Poisson distribution, settlement delays follow the same multinomial distribution, and settlements are single lump sums that are independent identically distributed random variables. Simulations using this model reveal that the development ratios and the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> estimates produced using the chain ladder method are positively biased. We obtain approximate formulas for the biases using Taylor series expansions of the random variables about their means. The same methods ale used to obtain approximations for the variances and covariances of the projection ratios and the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> estimates. A simulation study reveals that OUI formulas ale highly accurate. 21 page(s...|$|R

40|$|There {{was very}} little net new lending by U. S. banks to {{developing}} countries in 1983 - 84, following the heavy lending of preceding years. When non-spontaneous lending to Brazil, Mexico and some other Latin American countries is deducted, there was an absolute decline in U. S. banks' claims on these countries. However, estimates of net new lending based on charges in <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> understate the amount of net new lending to these countries in 1983 - 84 by an amount {{on the order of}} $ 3 - 1 / 2 billion. This is because <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> were reduced by a number of factors other than repayments; such factors included loan charge-offs, sales of claims to non-bank investors, the exercise of official guarantees, and the statistical effects of exchange rate charges. Other aspects of U. S. bank lending to develop countries in 1983 - 84 were an increased concentration of the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> at the largest banks, and an increased concentration of the claims towards the public sector of the borrowing countries. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of sustainability and sustainable {{practices in the}} construction industry is ultimately benefiting the environment, society, and economics. Many green office buildings in Australia achieved Green Star ratings have <b>claimed</b> <b>outstanding</b> achievements such as energy efficiency, greenhouse gas reduction, healthy work environment, and productivity growth. However, in deciding to develop office projects, one of the main barriers identified is the additional cost that varies across Australia and globally. This creates a dilemma for making decisions to develop green buildings, particularly for those who follow the business as a usual approach. Utilizing secondary data published through the literature including grey literature, the paper aims to show the cost trend for green buildings in Australia and to identify affected-cost factors. The literature draws upon relevant information of cost. green features and Green Star ratings in office projects. The information is based on experts&# 039; studies published in standard academic sources and other sources, such as Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA) and peak industry bodies. The twelve-year worth of data and the information of 187 projects are examined.
