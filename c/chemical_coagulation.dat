Results: The results revealed that each of the coagulants in its optimal pH were able to arrange the magnesium chloride 86. 85 %, poly aluminum chloride 88. 47 % and ferric chloride 85. 41 % in removal of COD. Poly aluminum chloride achieved the highest dye removal 90. 92 %.

Materials and Methods: At present study, slaughterhouse wastewater after initial analysis was tested for survey of coagulation process using Poly aluminum chloride (PAC) at various doses (25 - 100 mg/L). Then we measured the concentrations of wastewater pollutants (BOD 5, COD, TKN, TSS and fecal Coliforms). Later, we transferred the effluent to the electrocoagulation unit and we evaluated the removal efficiency of pollutants in the range 10 to 40 volts of electric potential during 60 min. Results: It was found that the efficiency of <b>chemical</b> <b>coagulation</b> process using poly-aluminum chloride (PAC) as coagulant increases with increasing doses (from 25 to 100 mg/L); we achieved maximum removal efficiency during the <b>chemical</b> <b>coagulation</b> for parameters of BOD 5, COD, TSS, and TKN at 100 mg/L of PAC equivalent to 44. 78 %, 58. 52 %, 59. 9 %, and 39. 58 % respectively. Moreover, the results showed that with increasing the electric potential and reaction time, the yield increases linearly so that maximum removal efficiency at a dose of 100 mg/L PAC, an electrical potential of 40 volts and a reaction time of 60 minutes for the parameters BOD 5, COD, TSS, and TKN was 99. 18 % 99. 25 %, 82. 55 %, and 93. 97 % respectively.
