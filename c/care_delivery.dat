Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987, which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees. The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Progress {{towards the}} Millennium Development Goals for {{maternal}} health has been slow, and accelerated progress in scaling up professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> is needed. This paper describes poor-rich inequalities {{in the use}} of maternity care and seeks to understand these inequalities through comparisons with other types of health care. METHODS: Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 45 developing countries were used to describe poor-rich inequalities by wealth quintiles in maternity <b>care</b> (professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> and antenatal care), full childhood immunization coverage and medical treatment for diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). FINDINGS: Poor-rich inequalities in maternity care in general, and professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> in particular, are much greater than those in immunization coverage or treatment for childhood illnesses. Public-sector inequalities make up {{a major part of the}} poor-rich inequalities in professional delivery attendance. Even <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> provided by nurses and midwives favours the rich in most countries. Although poor-rich inequalities within both rural and urban areas are large, most births without professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> occur among the rural poor. CONCLUSION: Poor-rich inequalities in professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> are much larger than those in the other forms of care. Reducing poor-rich inequalities in professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> is essential to achieving the MDGs for maternal health. The greatest improvements in professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> can be made by increasing coverage among the rural poor. Problems with availability, accessibility and affordability, as well as the nature of the services and demand factors, appear to contribute to the larger poor-rich inequalities in <b>delivery</b> <b>care.</b> A concerted effort of equity-oriented policy and research is needed to address the huge poor-rich inequalities in maternity car...|$|R

40|$|Background : Maternal {{mortality}} rate (MMR) in Central Java {{is still very}} high. It is around 250 to 300 per 100. 000 child births. The higher MMR in Indonesia is mostly caused by bleeding, infection and eclampsia and other disease complications that have been suffered before and during pregnancy of the women. Improving community participation particularly husband and parent, to support antenatal <b>care</b> and <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> of their pregnant women, {{might be expected to}} reduce maternal {{mortality rate}}. Method : This study aims to identify the relationship between the role of husband and parent in supporting to visit health personnel (at least midwife) for antenatal <b>care</b> and <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> of pregnant women and their behaviour. This study employs a cross-sectional survey with 87 samples of pregnant women. Face to face interview was employed to collect data from the respondents. Triangulation was employed by using indepth interviews to husband and parents to confirm their roles. Quantitative data was analysed using Chi-square and logistic regression test and content analysis was used to analyse qualitative data. Results : The study shows that there was significant relationship between the role of husband and behaviour of pregnant mothers in antenatal <b>care</b> and <b>delivery</b> (p: 0. 000). Likewise, the role of parent has also significant relationship with behaviour of pregnant mothers (p: 0. 000). Logistic regression test indicated that the role of husband 2 ̆ 7 s support has more influence than parent 2 ̆ 7 s for both antenatal and <b>delivery</b> <b>care.</b> The study suggests that midwife and other health personnel need to provide information to husbands in order to socialize their role in antenatal and <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> programmes...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} maternal pregnancy intention and professional antenatal and <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> utilization. Our data were derived from the 2011 nationally representative Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey. We included antenatal and <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> utilization data {{of the most recent}} live births for women for the previous three years (n = 4672). We used multilevel logistic regression models to assess the relationship between pregnancy intention and use of professional antenatal and <b>delivery</b> <b>care,</b> with adjustment for potential confounding variables. Approximately 13 % and 16 % of children were reported by their mothers as unwanted and mistimed at the time of conception, respectively. Among the women, 55 % received at least one professional antenatal care service; 21 % received four or more professional antenatal services, while 32 % were attended by professionals during deliveries. Mothers of children whose pregnancies had been unwanted had a greater risk for not seeking professional antenatal and professional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> than those whose pregnancies had been wanted [1 ≥ ANC from professionals: AOR: 0. 66; 95 % CI: 0. 51 - 0. 93; 4 ≥ ANC from professionals: AOR: 0. 56; 95 % CI: 0. 37 - 0. 84; and <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> from professionals: AOR: 0. 70; 95 % CI: 0. 50 - 0. 97]. Women who were married after age 18, had secondary or higher level of education, and were from the wealthiest households were more likely to utilize antenatal and <b>delivery</b> <b>care.</b> Unwanted pregnancy is significantly associated with lower utilization of professional antenatal and <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> services in Bangladesh. Reducing unwanted births and promoting access to professional antenatal and <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> are crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 in Bangladesh...|$|R

To know this, we conducted a community-based cross-sectional study for assessing women's autonomy and utilization of safe <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> service in Kapilvastu district of Nepal from June to October 2014. We used multivariate modeling to associate socioeconomic factors and women's autonomy with the utilization of safe <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> services. Just over one-third of women sought institutional <b>delivery</b> <b>care</b> during the birth of their last child. Out of the total deliveries at health facilities, nearly 58 % women visited health facility for self-reported emergency obstructive care. Only 6. 2 % home deliveries were handled by health workers and 14. 7 % women used the safe delivery kit for home <b>delivery</b> <b>care.</b> Higher levels of women's education had a strong positive association (odds ratio = 24. 11, CI = 9. 43 - 61. 64) with institutional <b>delivery</b> <b>care.</b> Stratified analysis showed that when the husband is educated, women's education seems to work partly through their autonomy in decision making.
