The <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> was put off to Saturday. López consulted a friend and advisor, María Elvira Samper, who told him: [...] "Publísh it, Felipe." [...] He decided to do so, under a headline asking, [...] "Should Ernesto Samper resign?" [...] His editor, thus placated, returned to work. But on Sunday, drug lord Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela was captured, requiring that the issue be remade with a whole new cover story.|$|E

Moreover, <b>the</b> rewards <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incumbent can be higher because buyers prefer to buy services from <b>the</b> owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network.

In an attempt to ease pressure on margins, and both brand and product range profitability, marketers would {{be well advised to}} reinspect their policies towards brand naming and the attendant costs associated with those policies.

40|$|Central to {{this thesis}} is the {{question}} whether age-determined periods of emotional instability {{can be observed in}} normally developing infants. From a developmental psychobiological perspective, it is unlikely that there is a strictly timed universal pattern of periods of characteristic infant behavior, especially if this behavior is related to emotions and motherinfant interaction. To presuppose <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> such a pattern would amount to leave aside each infant's developmental status, history and temperament, and such influential environmental and family factors as maternal personality and caregiving style. Nonetheless, a study by Van de Rijt-Plooij and Plooij (1992 a) reported findings of a universal pattern of 10 strictly timed periods characterised by infant emotional instability and increased motherinfant body contact. <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> this thesis thesis is twofold.

40|$|The results {{presented}} in this paper are refinements of some results {{presented in}} a previous paper. Three such refined results are presented.

As was shown in the previous paper, in many cases one can recover the real function from its Fourier coefficients even if the corresponding Fourier series diverges almost everywhere. In such cases we say that the real function is still representable by its Fourier coefficients.

Es wird erklärt, dass Argumente, Aussagen, Urteile und Bewertungen aus Sicht der Europäischen Mehrheit implizit als universell und generell akzeptiert angesehen werden. Eine genauere Analyse des Gegenstands macht jedoch deutlich, dass die Europäischen Positionen Produkte ihrer eigenen sozialen und kulturellen Geschichte sind und daher nicht verallgemeinert werden können.

Diese sind: das Paradigma der religiösen Säkularisierung, das Paradigma {{rational}} choice und religiöser Selbstkonstruktion und das Paradigma der invisible religion. Die Analyse dieser Paradigmen zeigt, dass der europäische Blick auf die Türkei von individuellen religiösen und kulturellen Erfahrungen dominiert wird, welche den muslimischen Beitrittskandidaten in den Köpfen der Menschen verdächtig wirken lassen. Solche Überzeugungen und Gesinnungen werden fixiert, bevor der politische Diskurs beginnt und beeinflussen daher das Ergebnis der Debatte.

The hatred and revenge which had animated his victorious soldiery in the battle and in the pursuit, were changed immediately by the permission to compassion and good will. The ferocious soldiers turned at once from <b>the</b> pleasure <b>of</b> hunting their discomfited enemies to death, to that of protecting and defending them; and the way was prepared for their being received into his service, and incorporated with <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> his army as friends and brothers.|$|R
50|$|Toward <b>the</b> <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decade, {{manufacturing}} <b>issues</b> began plaguing <b>the</b> AIM {{alliance in}} much the same way they did Motorola, which consistently pushed back deployments of new processors for Apple and other vendors: first from Motorola in the 1990s with the PowerPC 7xx and 74xx processors, and IBM with the 64-bit PowerPC 970 processor in 2003. In 2004, Motorola exited the chip manufacturing business by spinning off its semiconductor business as an independent company called Freescale Semiconductor. Around the same time, IBM exited the 32-bit embedded processor market by selling its line of PowerPC products to Applied Micro Circuits Corporation (AMCC) and focusing on 64-bit chip designs, while maintaining its commitment of PowerPC CPUs toward game console makers such as Nintendo's GameCube and Wii, Sony's PlayStation 3 and Microsoft's Xbox 360, <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> latter two both use 64-bit processors. In 2005 Apple announced they would no longer use PowerPC processors in their Apple Macintosh computers, favoring Intel-produced processors instead, citing <b>the</b> performance limitations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chip for future personal computer hardware specifically related to heat generation and energy usage, as well as <b>the</b> inability <b>of</b> IBM to move the 970 processor to the 3 GHz range. The IBM-Freescale alliance was replaced by an open standards body called Power.org. Power.org operates under <b>the</b> governance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IEEE with IBM continuing to use and evolve the PowerPC processor on game consoles and Freescale Semiconductor focusing solely on embedded devices.|$|R

5000|$|Robert Kanigher mused {{in letters}} columns in the 1970s and 1980s that Rock {{probably}} belonged to [...] "The Big Red One" [...] (First US Infantry Division) given his appearance on battlefields in North Africa, Italy, and Northwest Europe. Rock's backstory was fleshed out in different comics over the years; generally he {{is considered to}} have come from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he worked in a steel mill. Enlisting after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he went to North Africa as a private but promotion came quickly as his superiors were killed, to assistant squad leader, squad leader, and then platoon sergeant. During the main series, his unit is only ever given as [...] "Easy Company", but no regiment or division is named nor is unit insignia ever shown. Rock is shown to have two siblings (Sgt. Rock #421) Larry, a Marine fighting in the Pacific and Amy, a nun. In the 2009 six-issue mini-series [...] "Sgt. Rock: The Lost Battalion" [...] Rock's unit is still referred to as [...] "Easy Company" [...] but is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 141st Infantry Regiment. However, in <b>the</b> <b>closing</b> pages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last <b>issue,</b> <b>the</b> narration states that, following <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story, [...] "As usual, Sgt. Rock's 'Combat-Happy Joes' moved out to fill <b>the</b> ranks <b>of</b> another Easy Company left fractured by war", moving them to the 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Division, under 2nd Lieutenant Audie Murphy. A famous tagline of Rock's is: [...] "Nothin's easy in Easy Company." ...|$|R
40|$|Eugene O 2 ̆ 7 Neill {{included}} within {{his vision of}} humanity a series of complex, emotionally and psychologically developed black characters. Despite critical controversy over his methods or effectiveness, from his eerily silent mulatto in 2 ̆ 2 Thirst 2 ̆ 2 through <b>the</b> grandiose incarnation <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Emperor Jones and <b>the</b> everyman <b>of</b> Joe Mott and The Iceman Cometh, O 2 ̆ 7 Neill created characters of African descent that thrilled and infuriated critics and audiences alike. A <b>closer</b> exploration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> involved in his portrayal of ethnically identified characters seems necessary, an exploration that does not limit itself to an interrogation of ethnicity per se in O 2 ̆ 7 Neill 2 ̆ 7 s plays, but one that addresses <b>the</b> portrayal <b>of</b> black characters {{and whether or not}} O 2 ̆ 7 Neill privileges one 2 ̆ 2 race, 2 ̆ 2 or socially and culturally identifiable population. O 2 ̆ 7 Neill 2 ̆ 7 s infusion of 2 ̆ 2 psychology 2 ̆ 2 into his black characters may have delineated them as fate-driven primitives at <b>the</b> mercy <b>of</b> their atavistic histories, but he did the same with his Irish and other ethnic characters. In fact, many critics argue that his Irish characters are particularly subject to caricature, yet O 2 ̆ 7 Neill is not generally understood to be anti-Irish. Are we then to understand O 2 ̆ 7 Neill 2 ̆ 7 s portrayl <b>of</b> ethnicity in <b>the</b> superstition and fear <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Dreamy Kid and Brutus Jones, or in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> playwright 2 ̆ 7 s bold and dismissive retort to the Ku Klux Klan 2 ̆ 7 s condemnation of interracial casting in All God 2 ̆ 7 s Chillun Got Wings? It would be a spurious examination that intentionally disregards perceived racist phenomena in O 2 ̆ 7 Neill 2 ̆ 7 s plays. However, his depiction of racialized behaviors (and his own possible racism) must be seen to function as an extra-discursive element that ultimately does not disrupt <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a unified body of work. His major black characters, tragic or otherwise, are not limited by their deceptively stylized portrayals but rather reflect O 2 ̆ 7 Neill 2 ̆ 7 s quest to understand and examine <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> a common human experience, a view that is ultimately consistent within <b>the</b> entirety <b>of</b> his canon...|$|R
