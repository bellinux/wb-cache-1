5000|$|An annular cutter (also {{called as}} core drill, <b>core</b> <b>cutter,</b> broach cutter, Trepanning drill or cup-type cutter) is a hollow, {{multiple}} cutting edges cutting tool used to make/drill holes in ferrous and non-ferrous metals. An annular cutter cuts only an annular groove at {{the periphery of}} the hole and leaves a solid core or slug at the hole center. [...] Annular cutter is a substitute for slower, more expensive and less efficient Twist drills and Hole saws. The function of Annular Cutters is more or less same as a hole saw but differs in geometry and material. Annular cutters are faster, easier and are more accurate than the conventional twist drills or drill bits.|$|E
50|$|These {{are used}} when {{laboratory}} testing {{is not enough}} to determine the required properties of the ground. Laboratory samples are at times not considered to be representative and of insufficient quality, stress, pore pressure, and degree of saturation. Discontinuities in the ground can also warrant filed tests. Sample sizes depend on ground nature and test type. Boreholes are commonly used. The SPT is a simple and inexpensive test which can furnish a piling contractor with useful information. The van test is used to determine the shear strength of a soil - material with coarse silt or sand can mean unreliable results. Permeability is found by determining whether the relevant aquifer is confined on unconfined with cognizance of the normal fluctuations in the aquifer. Installation of the borehole itself may influence stresses. For a reliable test this should be followed by a pumping test. Packer tests are also used to measure the impermeability of grouted ground and permeability of dam foundations, strength and deformation data can also be taken. There are many types, mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic, the latter being the most popular. A clean borehole with a properly seated packer is essential (cement mortar is sometime used). Geophysical logs from the boreholes used can be taken at the same time enhancing the value of the results. Pressuremeter tests are used to stress, stiffness and strength of the ground to be investigated. It can be used in most ground types. There are three main types - pre-bored, self bored and pushed in. Boring should do minimal damage to the ground as much as possible. an unload reload method of around three times is used to give an accurate value of stiffness. Probing from the surface is done using a steel rod. Mainly used at a preliminary stage, it is also useful to check surrounding ground but is unsuitable in soils with boulders and cobbles. Static probing is mostly conducted with the use of electric sensors. It is quick and cheap. Pumping allows the determination of groundwater conditions using pumping and observation wells. Data interpretation can be complicated and is classed in steady and non-steady states. Density testing is conducted using the average of three results to obtain a significant result. The use of the sand replacement and <b>core</b> <b>cutter</b> test are common and the use of water replacement, rubber balloon, and nuclear methods are also used.In-situ testing data is important to design of works. Stress measurement in rocks and soils can be determined. Bearing tests are used to determine the shear strength and deformation characteristics of a soil. In-situ shear testing is done using a system similar to the laboratory shear box test. Large scale testing should be assessed on a case by case basis. Slope failure or settlement of a structure after field tests have been conducted are examples of phenomena which may be considered as back analysis, this be conducted successfully when accompanied by a full investigation to determine the ground and ground water conditions. Geophysical surveying can be useful in site investigation for determining layers of rock other geological features, locating aquifers, mineral deposits, voids - natural or man-made and engineering properties of the ground. Electrical resistivity and seismic methods amongst others are used. This is a specialized field. The geophysical adviser should be involved at all stages. Experience has shown care should be taken when writing the specification for this type of work amongst other factors.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{technique}} {{was used to}} measure the resultant forces in the anterior cruciate ligament during a series of loading experiments on seventeen fresh-frozen cadaver specimens. The base of the liga-ment’s tibial attachment was mechanically isolated with a <b>coring</b> <b>cutter,</b> and a specially designed load-transducer was fixed to the bone-plug that contained the ligament’s tibial insertion so that the resultant forces were directly measured by the load-cell. Although the magnitudes of values for forces varied considerably between specimens for a given test condi-tion, the patterns of loading with respect to direction of loading and the angle of flexion of the knee were re-markably consistent.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} before the processing and manufacturing industries is disposal of the residual waste products. Pond ash and red mud are one {{of the major}} waste products of any aluminum industry. The pond ash and red mud sample are acquired form BALCO, Korba where they are disposed off using the Thick Slurry Disposal System, which enables quick consolidation of the slurry once disposed at the ash and red mud pond sites. The project work focuses on the suitability of pond ash and red mud obtained hereby to be used for construction of embankment. The ash and red mud samples are characterized and analyzed for the various geotechnical properties. The various experimental works include in situ density test using <b>core</b> <b>cutter</b> method, Standard Proctor density test to obtain the maximum dry density and optimum moisture content, and specific gravity test. Using the OMC and MDD results, Direct Shear Box test and Triaxial tests of the samples were carried out in 2 -D and 3 -D load conditions to obtain the shear strength parameters, c and Ф. The samples were also tested for their permeability characteristics using both falling head and constant head permeameter to obtain the coefficient of permeability, κ.

40|$|The {{final design}} of an {{electro-mechanical}} drill {{is very simple}} both in shape and in mechanism. It is a straight tube consisting of an antitorque section, motor and computer section, chip chamber and <b>core</b> barrel. Three <b>cutters</b> (rake angle : 30 to 40 degrees, pitch : 5 to 7 mm) are attached to cut an ice core 94 mm in diameter and bore hole 135 mm in diameter. The maximum core length is 2. 1 m long. Chips are transported between the core barrel and the outer tube by spiral rim attached to the core barrel. No motor for sucking chips up to the chip chamber is installed. The chips are separated from liquid by the filter at top of the chip chamber, and are compacted to the density of 500 kg/m^ 3. In the pressure tight electronics section, a computer, DC brushless motor (270 V, 600 W, 12000 rpm) and reduction gear (1 / 170) are installed. The antitorque section has three leaf springs. A steel cable 7. 7 mm in diameter has been chosen. The actual drilling operation is easy, for {{in response to the}} cutter load, a switching signal (go or stop) can be sent from the relay computer to the winch controller.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop {{guidelines}} for construction of low volume concrete roads in Sri Lanka. A survey was carried out to study current concrete road construction practices and knowledge of the contractors involved in concrete road construction. Survey results show that good practices have not been adopted in low volume road construction in Sri Lanka. The authors have introduced best practices which can be easily adopted by the local road construction industry. Incorrect joints construction was observed in concrete roads during the site visit and the Authors have introduced a new device for contraction joint construction. A modification to the available method was proposed to measure surface undulation on local concrete pavements and allowable undulation was determined through field investigation. A comparison of various kinds of concrete producing and curing methods and their performance were studied. The authors have evaluated the effectiveness of rebound hammer method which has been used for quality control by some consultants. Rebound hammer reading was compared with compressive strength which was found out from <b>core</b> <b>cutter</b> samples. Double beam vibrator with inbuilt camber was introduced to consolidate and form the camber of the surface layer. Check lists for subgrade /subbase, shoulder, formwork and concrete placing and finishing have been introduced to address weakness and enhance the quality of the pavement construction. Quality and Cost control techniques in the field of low volume concrete road construction in Sri Lanka are also described. Further, the proposed guideline describes the most appropriate methods for preparation of subgrade, subbase and shoulder, and mixing, placing and finishing of concrete...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{nondestructive}} testing (NDT) is to obtain material properties “in place” specimens without {{the destruction of}} the specimens and to do the structural health monitoring. NDT using Rebound hammer, Ultra pulse velocity, Halfcell potential, <b>core</b> <b>cutter,</b> carbonation depth, rebar locator, Rapid chloride penetration test, electric resistivity meter test and vibration base analysis by data analoger are very popular and highly effective in conducting structural health monitoring. The structure can be investigated by using a visual inspection, NDT, laboratory and field test performance. In this article a review of these tests have been provided to conduct effective structural health monitoring of a RCC structure. The estimation of mechanical properties of concrete can be carried out by several methods; destructive and nondestructive. In this context, the crushing of the samples is the usual destructive test to determine the concrete strength. The rebound hammer test and the ultrasonic device are used in the field of nondestructive tests to determine respectively the compression strength and the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) in the concrete. In this work, eight concrete compositions were used to prepare cylindrical specimens (16 cm x 32 cm) by varying the water/ cement ratio and the cement dosage. An experimental study was conducted to determine the compressive strength of concrete by destructive (compression) and nondestructive (rebound hammer) tests at different ages (7, 14 and 28 days). In addition, the influence of several factors on the modulus of elasticity determined by pulse velocity test was investigated. These factors mainly included the age of concrete and the water/ cement ratio. The results showed that the difference between the resistance values obtained by destructive and nondestructive methods decreases with increasing age of concrete. The dynamic modulus of elasticity increases with the curing time of the concrete until the age of three months. In addition, a simplified expression has been proposed to estimate the rebound number from the value of the dynamic modulus of elasticity determined by pulse velocity test...|$|E
