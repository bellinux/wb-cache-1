500|$|Although Stanton did {{not know}} who murdered Archie, she guessed {{that it could be}} Stacey Slater (which turned out to be correct). Speaking of this, she said that Sophie {{was one of the few}} to {{correctly}} guess it was Stacey. [...] "I had an epiphany about a week before the live episode. It was a memory of the whole Who Shot Phil? storyline, and how there were eight different suspects, including some really hard blokes, and it turned out to be Lisa. I knew DCI Marsden wasn’t going to get the culprit, because of a couple of scenes of the following episode we’d shot in December, and I thought that narratively, Stacey was the only person who the audience would forgive, and who <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> That was my theory and it turned out to be right!" [...] Naomi Mcelroy from The Sunday Mirror thought that Marsden could be Archie's killer. Marsden left on 22 February 2010, and returned on 5 January 2012. She returned after Phil is framed for Kevin Wicks' (Phil Daniels)'s death and that of a homeless man, who died accidentally in a car-lot fire (part of an insurance scam). According to Inside Soap the police would begin questioning Phil's former fiancée Stella Crawford's death, teasing Marsden's return: [...] "The investigation is set to bring Phil face to face with his old nemisis, DCI Marsden – and this time she'll stop at nothing to put the bad boy permanently behind bars". Digital Spy reported that Marsden re-opens the investigation into Stella's death, [...] "suspecting that all is not what it seems". Finally, Marsden returned for two single episodes on 17 August 2012.|$|E
2500|$|John Willes (1778 in Headcorn, Kent – 5 August 1852 in Staunton, Gloucester) was an English cricketer who, {{though he}} made only five known {{first-class}} appearances, {{had a significant}} impact on the game's history and development. [...] Willes played for Kent county cricket teams and was a fast underarm or, when he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> roundarm bowler.|$|E
2500|$|Although Willes {{had quit}} the game, {{he had made}} his point and others were willing to pick his ball up and persevere. In 1826, Sussex had the best team in England and were {{acclaimed}} as the [...] "Champion County" [...] in some quarters. Their success owed much to the prowess of two top-class bowlers William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge, both of whom were champions of the roundarm style, when they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Lillywhite was one of the all-time great bowlers and was nicknamed [...] "the Nonpareil".|$|E

2500|$|... "Collectivism" [...] and [...] "anti-authoritarianism" [...] was {{cemented}} {{into the}} mutineers core values {{and all of}} these beliefs would influence the decision to turn pirate and how they would conduct themselves thereafter. In contrast to the egalitarian belief towards mutiny, Peter Leeson argues, the [...] "prospect of sufficient gain" [...] may influence a sailor; piracy could pay extremely well sometimes better than privateering. A pirate could enjoy every penny of the ship's [...] "ill-gotten booty." [...] Another argument against the egalitarian idea of mutiny that Leeson suggests is that the pirate was as [...] "self-interested as anyone else" [...] and [...] "given the opportunity" [...] would ultimately [...] "take ten times as many shares" [...] as his fellow pirates if in fact they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{concealment}} {{of assets}} by the wealthy {{appears to have}} been widespread, so that a client of Lysias boasts that his father would never resort to it: [...] "when he might well have put his fortune away out of sight and refused to help you, he preferred that you should know of it, in order that, even if he chose to be a bad citizen, he could not, but must make the required contributions and perform the liturgies." [...] According to Demosthenes, the rich hid their assets and [...] did not reveal them to the public unless war threatened them or their holdings. The accusation of evasion of public charges [...] was very common in judicial speeches: litigants clearly played upon the prejudices of the jury, [...] that all the rich preferred not to pay, if they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Racing began hesitantly after 1945. The {{first in}} Germany for 17 years were in 1950; two further races {{were held at}} Wembley in 1951 and 1952. Eventually, though, European races began to decline. Races {{continued}} through the night, as {{they had in the}} USA, but the costs of keeping open stadiums for partygoers who'd missed the bus and a small number of dedicated fans was too great. London dropped night racing when it revived six-day racing in 1967 at Earls Court and the following year at Wembley a new organiser, former rider Ron Webb, scheduled just the afternoon and evening, with a break between sessions. Other organisers were not impressed and insisted Webb call his race a [...] "six" [...] and not a [...] "six-day". One by one, however, they followed Webb's pattern and there are now no old-style 24-hour races left. The last was Madrid. There the riders trundled round all night or, if they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> slipped off for bed. Tom Simpson remembered: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He would, if {{he thought}} he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the trick," [...] replied Dave. He turned to Mrs. Carmody. [...] "Would you mind letting us see the letter Mr. Blower sent you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{like to see}} {{the mule}} that <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> me," [...] Master Carrots said contemptuously; and just then the farmer came out of a {{neighbouring}} shop, looking around as if in search of some one or something.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{improvisation}} {{on top of}} canovaccio enabled the avoidance of censorship because censors cannot censor that which is not written.

6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> I came {{over on the}} boat with him, and I knew he was {{travelling}} round the world and wasn't going to stay {{more than a day}} in New York. Even then I had to go some to get into this place. Burke told me to get hold of old Chester and get a letter of introduction from him. And here you come along and just stroll in and tell them you have come to stay!" [...] He brooded for a moment on the injustice of things. [...] "Well, {{what are you going to}} do about it, Pal?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been on {{the trail}} of that order for a month," [...] he declared. [...] "Of course it isn't my {{business}} to get orders, but to manage this mill, and that's enough for one man, God knows. But I heard the Bradlaughs were in the market for these goods, and I told the selling house to lie low, that I'd go after it. I knew I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> if anybody could. I went to the Bradlaughs and sat down on 'em, I lived with 'em, ate with 'em, brought 'em home at night. I didn't let 'em alone a minute until they handed it over. I wasn't going to give any other mill in New England or any of those southern concerns a chance to walk off with it--not on your life! Why, we have the facilities. There isn't another mill in the country can turn it out in the time they ask, and even we will have to go some to do it. But we'll do it, by George, unless I'm struck by lightning." ...|$|E

5000|$|On January 28, 2004, Thoma {{agreed to}} engage Hirte in a {{telephone}} conversation about the murder, while the police listened and recorded what was said. During that telephone call, Hirte told Thoma he'd killed Kopitske [...] "to see if he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it".|$|R

5000|$|While no {{sufficient}} evidence of Kōno's involvement was found, {{he was accused}} by the media in perpetrating the attack when police hinted at possibility of his involvement.

5000|$|Glenn Kopitske (July 24, 1966 - July 31, 2003), age 37, {{was murdered}} by 17-year-old Gary Hirte in Wisconsin on July 31, 2003. Hirte {{initially}} admitted to killing Kopitske [...] "to see if he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it".

50|$|Script editor Terrance Dicks has {{frequently}} {{stated that he}} disliked the original premise of the Doctor being trapped on Earth, and had meant to subvert this plan {{as soon as he}} felt he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> He recalls in a DVD documentary interview (on the Inferno release) having had it pointed out to him by Malcolm Hulke that the format limited the stories to merely two types: alien invasion and mad scientist.|$|E
5000|$|National University of Singapore, {{corporate}} governance expert Mak Yuen Teen, noted that procurement {{in the defense}} industry is particularly vulnerable to bribery and corruption. [...] "It is usually not that transparent," [...] with infrequent bidding for large contracts. Blowing the whistle on superior officers might also be discouraged, he indicated. [...] "Those at the top probably thought they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> as their underlings were unlikely to squeal on them." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Gert, acting rationally {{does not}} always require acting morally. [...] For example, it is not irrational to set a trap {{for someone who is}} wearing an Armani suit so that they fall into a {{swimming}} pool in front of a video camera, since the pleasure one can get out of watching the video constitutes an adequate reason for harming the other person. It would also be rational for a sadist to torture other people for fun provided the sadist <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Tong Li's {{original}} {{method of}} operation was to procure new comics from Japanese distributors, replacing the Japanese text with traditional Chinese, and [...] "drawing bras on bare-breasted women characters and modifying, up to what they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with,</b> explicitly sexual or violent panels". The head of Tong Li, Fang Wan-nan(范萬楠), [...] "jokingly referred to himself as the 'king of pirated comics'".|$|R
5000|$|Wyn {{was famous}} for paying his authors as little as he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with,</b> which {{prompted}} David McDaniel to encode a comment on Wyn {{into one of his}} The Man from U.N.C.L.E. novelizations, The Monster Wheel Affair.

Prosecutors contended that Hirte murdered Kopitske {{to see if he}} <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Hirte pleaded insanity, {{claiming}} he killed Kopitske in a murderous rage after a consensual sexual encounter with the victim, because he felt a homosexual act was [...] "worse than murder". The 'temporary insanity' mitigation plea was not upheld, he was found guilty, and received a life sentence.|$|E
5000|$|Filming {{also took}} place at New Canaan, Norwalk and Stamford, Connecticut. Stamford served as the {{backdrop}} for the scenes featuring Atlanta, while some residential area from New Canaan has been presented as rural setting in Georgia. Talking about the filming locations Scandiffio said that, [...] "We realized we <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> visually with certain pieces of property and roads in Connecticut as the film travels to Georgia, because the film is dialogue heavy, {{a lot of it}} will be interior shots and we can easily get away with most of it being filmed in Connecticut."

As a child, and a wooden one at that, Charlie <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> double entendres which were otherwise impossible under broadcast standards of the time.|$|R

5000|$|As merchants {{accumulated}} profits, some became financiers. There was {{a conflict}} of preferences: Financiers prefer high interest rates, merchants prefer low interest rates.
