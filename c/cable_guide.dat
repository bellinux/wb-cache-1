5000|$|Due to {{increasing}} demands {{within the field}} of automation technology in the 1980s, such as increasing loads, moving <b>cables</b> <b>guided</b> inside <b>cable</b> carriers often failed, although the cable carriers themselves did not.

50|$|News Corporation sold TV Guide to the United Video Satellite Group, {{parent company}} of Prevue Networks, on June 11, 1998 for $800 million and 60 million shares of stock worth an {{additional}} $1.2 billion (this followed an earlier merger attempt between the two companies in 1996 that eventually fell apart). Following the sale, reports suggested that TV Guide would remove program listings from the magazine, shifting them entirely to its new sister cable network Prevue Channel, which would be rebranded {{as a result of}} United Video's purchase of TV Guide magazine; News Corporation executives later stated that listings information would remain part of the magazine. That year, United Video acquired TVSM Inc.

5000|$|Reacquired {{five years}} later, Naubuc was {{reinstated}} to the Naval Vessel Register 1 June 1967 arid {{scheduled to be}} converted to a Salvage Craft Tender. In March 1968 she was reclassified (ARST-4) and assigned to the 13th Naval District for conversion. In her later years, she was outfitted with four 12-cylinder diesel engines that powered four rotating thrusters mounted on vertical shafts. She was configured as a cable laying and implantment vessel with a cable drum located in the bow along with a <b>cable</b> <b>guide</b> going over the stern. The four thrusters allowed the vessel to stay [...] "on station". When underway, however, only the two bow or stern thrusters were operated at any one time. The vertical thruster shafts increased the vessel's draft significantly. The thrusters were easily damaged by impact with the bottom. The Naubuc's final mission was as a support vessel for a cable underwater recovery vehicle (CURV-2) in the Tongue of the Ocean, off Andros Island.|$|E

40|$|A {{versatile}} cable-dispensing cart {{can support}} {{as many as}} a few dozen reels of cable, wire, and/or rope. The cart can be adjusted to accommodate reels of various diameters and widths, and can be expanded, contracted, or otherwise reconfigured by use of easily installable and removable parts that can be carried onboard. Among these parts are dispensing rods and a <b>cable</b> <b>guide</b> that enables dispensing of cables without affecting the direction of pull. Individual reels can be mounted on or removed from the cart without affecting the other reels: this feature facilitates the replacement or reuse of partially depleted reels, thereby helping to reduce waste. Multiple cables, wires, or ropes can be dispensed simultaneously. For maneuverability, the cart is mounted on three wheels. Once it has been positioned, the cart is supported by rubber mounts for stability and for prevention of sliding or rolling during dispensing operations. The stability and safety of the cart are enhanced by a low-center-of-gravity design. The cart can readily be disassembled into smaller units for storage or shipping, then reassembled in the desired configuration at a job site...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUnsafe {{acts are}} {{believed}} to account for approximately 80 to 90 percent of accidents. This paper will investigate this issue through exploring the reasoning behind the unsafe acts {{that resulted in a}} minor accident on a large construction project (+$ 1 B) in the UK. The study described here, part of a wider PhD project, was undertaken using an ethnographic approach. Participant observation enabled the researcher {{to be involved in the}} whole accident investigation process including witness statement interviews, informal discussions, post-accident reports and meetings. The understandings displayed by those involved in the minor accident included a desire for a lack of blame, with the incident being described as ‘an act of god’. The study reveals intentional unsafe acts that were due to time pressures, an acceptance of the unsafe act as a social norm and a lack of planning and training. Without any investigation, this accident could have been attributed purely to a <b>cable</b> <b>guide,</b> which could have been considered an unsafe condition. However, through thorough investigation there were also four unsafe acts related to the accident discovered: three of which were intentional. The construction industry needs to shift its safety management effort towards the understanding and elimination of unsafe acts despite them being more difficult to identify and prevent than unsafe conditions. Changing intentional unsafe behaviours is one of the next steps for improving health and safety of the industry, and the insights from this paper add to the knowledge of why these unsafe acts occur...|$|E
40|$|Elastic guided {{waves are}} of {{interest}} for the non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of <b>cables.</b> <b>Guided</b> waves are multimodal and dispersive. Cables are complex structures, helical, multi-wired and highly prestressed. This further complicates the interpretation of measurement. Numerical models are required for understanding guided wave propagation and optimizing inspection systems. This paper reports on the modeling of wave propagation inside seven-wire strands, typically encountered in civil-engineering cables, including complicating effects such as geometry curvature and prestress. Special attention {{is given to the}} interwire energy transfer occurring in a seven-wire strand excited by a source localized in a single wire. Numerical results show how the energy transfer decreases with frequency, which leads to the discovery of a compressional mode of local type. This mode may have interesting features for the NDE of cables...|$|R
