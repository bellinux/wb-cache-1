Ike Turner would later claim that he signed against his will since he was heavily addicted to <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> the time and accepted a $50,000 payment, waiving {{the right to sue}} the film company for their portrayal of him in the film. The film What's Love Got to Do with It helped to damage Ike's career in the 1990s. Due to the film and the book, Ike's name became synonymous with domestic violence, overshadowing his contributions to music.|$|E
25|$|On 3 September 2014, Voigt {{announced}} that he would try to beat the UCI hour record of 49.7 kilometers held by Ondřej Sosenka. The record attempt took place on 18 September 2014 in the Vélodrome Suisse in Grenchen. Jens Voigt's plans to attempt the record were hatched in June 2014 and followed some of the planning that was made for Fabian Cancellara's possible <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> the record. At 43 years old, Voigt had to work on his position on his bike to improve his aerodynamics. The bike on which the German rode was revealed on 12 September 2014. The attempt occurred on the day after Voigt's 43rd birthday and was broadcast live by Eurosport and the UCI channel on YouTube. Prior to the attempt, some prominent cycling personalities such as Bradley Wiggins, Eddy Merckx and Chris Boardman expressed the opinion that Voigt had a fair chance of beating the 49.7km mark.|$|E

25|$|Adama {{turned his}} attentions {{on the only}} major state in Fumbina that could present a threat to his fledgling emirate: Mandara. It was an {{attractive}} target. It lay between Bornu {{to the north and}} Baghirmi in the Chad Basin, so its fall would facilitate the conquest of these areas. Its people were already Muslim, though they mixed the religion with pagan practices. Moreover, it had a large population from whom soldiers could be conscripted, and it was renowned for its excellent horses. Mandara was well organised, however, and would not be an easy prize. The people who lived there, the Mandarawa, had a long-standing rivalry with the Fulani, who had fought them under the Bornu in previous years. This animosity only served to drive more Fulani to Adama's armies, though, as many veterans were eager for another <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> an old rival. Furthermore, Fulbe rulers Modibo Damraka and others were already embroiled in fighting against the Mandara in the Diamaré Plain. Sentiment for jihad was high.|$|E
25|$|He {{took some}} time to recover from that fight and gained even more weight to contend for the WBC Light Middleweight title, but losing in his first attempt at a {{championship}} in that division on January 30, 1982, against Wilfred Benítez by a 15 round unanimous decision, this after having defeated Nino Gonzalez and Luigi Minchillo, two rated Light Middleweights, both by ten round decisions in non-title bouts. Durán was also to lose his comeback fight in September 1982 in Detroit. Kirkland Laing, from London, shocked the boxing world, producing the type of display his talents promised yet he so rarely produced, taking the split decision. After being relegated to a 10 round walk out win over Englishman Jimmy Batten at The Battle of The Champions in Miami, Durán signed with promoter Bob Arum. This {{marked the beginning of}} a comeback in which he beat former world champion and now hall of famer Pipino Cuevas via a fourth round knock-out, which earned him a second <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> the light middleweight title, this time against WBA Champion Davey Moore.|$|E
25|$|The {{fracture}} surfaces on {{the outer}} part of the left wing were examined by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at its Division of Aeronautics in Melbourne. These examinations determined that separation of the left wing was initiated by metal fatigue of the lower main spar boom attachment socket. The primary structure of the Stinson was of welded steel tube construction. A fatigue crack had initiated in weld metal on the inner surface of the socket. After propagating through the weld metal during {{a large number of}} flights, the fatigue crack entered the socket's parent metal. This crack eventually affected 45% of the cross-section of the socket before the lower boom failed on the fatal flight. Investigators noted the amount of metal in the socket that was unaffected by the fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> the time of the accident and calculated that the wing was capable of supporting loads up to about 2.5 times the weight of the aircraft on its fatal flight. This suggested the gusting winds prevailing at the time, and the turbulence associated with the low altitude at which the aircraft was flying, were partly responsible for the failure.|$|E

Standout players Chad Henne, Mike Hart, and Jake Long all opted {{to return for}} their senior seasons for one last <b>crack</b> <b>at</b> Ohio State and {{a chance at a}} {{national}} championship, causing Michigan to be ranked fifth in the preseason polls. However, Michigan's struggles against the spread offense reared its ugly head again as the Wolverines shockingly lose the opener to the Appalachian State Mountaineers. The game marked the first win by a Division I-AA team over a team ranked in the Associated Press Poll. The next week, Michigan was blown out by Oregon, another spread team. Despite the early rough start, Michigan won their next eight games and went into the Ohio State game with a chance to win the Big Ten championship. However, Michigan once again fell to the Buckeyes, this time 14–3. After the game, Lloyd Carr announced that he would retire from Michigan after the bowl game. In the 2008 Capital One Bowl, Carr's final game, Michigan defeated the defending national champion Florida Gators, led by Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow, 41–35. Carr's accomplishments at Michigan included a 122–40 record, five Big Ten championships, and one national championship.|$|E
