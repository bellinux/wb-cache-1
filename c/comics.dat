40|$|This {{study of}} the <b>comic</b> {{technique}} of Jane Austen emphasises the social and moral basis of her comedy and begins with a chapter on an analysis of her values. It then proceeds to look at various aspects of her <b>comic</b> technique, namely, her <b>comic</b> characters, her <b>comic</b> situations and her <b>comic</b> voice. The second chapter distinguishes two main categories of <b>comic</b> characters: the 'comic fools,' usually the minor characters, unaware, undiscerning and often consistently <b>comic,</b> and the major <b>comic</b> characters, intelligent, perceptive and only <b>comic</b> at some points when they make mistakes of judgment and perception. The chapter concentrates on both the content and form of these characters, drawing illustrations from {{as many of the}} novels as possible. The third chapter traces the author's progress from the farcical and often unsubtle <b>comic</b> situations of the early works to the complex <b>comic</b> situations of the mature novels in which character and incident are much better co-ordinated. The chapter on the author's <b>comic</b> voice discusses the various devices by which Jane Austen makes her <b>comic</b> presence felt in her novels, and the final chapter examines the unfinished work Sanditon, pointing out new <b>comic</b> tendencies and tentatively suggesting that {{it might have been a}} different kind of <b>comic</b> novel. <p...|$|R
