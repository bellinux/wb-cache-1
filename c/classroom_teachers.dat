5|$|As {{part of the}} 2013 budget the Dunderdale {{government}} announced that the province's four English school boards would be consolidated into one, while the one French school board would remain as is. The number of school boards in the province had been reduced in 2004, from 10 boards to five. Since that time student enrolment in Newfoundland and Labrador had declined by 14,000, or 17 per cent. The government faced criticism for the amalgamation from people in the education system but despite this Minister Clyde Jackman announced {{the appointment of a}} transition team for the amalgamation on April 24, 2013, with a plan to have the new school board in place for September of that year. The budget also saw reductions in the Department of Education that would affect areas such as administration, learning resources support and district-based numeracy supports. However, the minister said there would be no reduction in the allocation of regular <b>classroom</b> <b>teachers,</b> and Jackman stated that Newfoundland and Labrador had the best student-teacher ratio in the country.|$|E

40|$|Teacher {{professional}} development provided by education advisors as one-off, centrally offered sessions {{does not always}} result in change in teacher knowledge, beliefs, attitudes or practice in the classroom. As the mathematics education advisor in this study, I set out to investigate a particular method of {{professional development}} so as to influence change in a practising <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher’s</b> knowledge and practices. The particular method of professional development utilised {{in this study was}} based on several principles of effective teacher professional development and saw me working regularly in a classroom with the <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> as well as providing ongoing support for her for a full school year. The intention was to document the effects of this particular method of professional development in terms of the <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher’s</b> and my professional growth to provide insights for others working as education advisors. The professional development for the <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> consisted of two components. The first was the co-operative development and implementation of a mental computation instructional program for the Year 3 class. The second component was the provision of ongoing support for the <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> by the education advisor. The design of the professional development and the mental computation instructional program were progressively refined throughout the year. The education advisor fulfilled multiple roles in the study as <b>teacher</b> in the <b>classroom,</b> <b>teacher</b> educator working with the <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> and researcher. Examples of the professional growth of the <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> and the education advisor which occurred as sequences of changes (growth networks, Hollingsworth, 1999) in the domains of the professional world of the <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> and education advisor were drawn from the large body of data collected through regular face-to-face and email communications between the <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher</b> and the education advisor as well as from transcripts of a structured interview. The Interconnected Model of Professional Growth (Clarke & Hollingsworth, 2002; Hollingsworth, 1999) was used to summarise and represent each example of the <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher’s</b> professional growth. A modified version of this model was used to summarise and represent the professional growth of the education advisor. This study confirmed that the method of professional development utilised could lead to significant teacher professional growth related directly to her work in the classroom. Using the Interconnected Model of Professional Growth to summarise and represent the <b>classroom</b> <b>teacher’s</b> professional growth and the modified version for my professional growth assisted with the recognition of examples of how we both changed. This model has potential to be used more widely by education advisors when preparing, implementing, evaluating and following-up on planned teacher professional development activities. The mental computation instructional program developed and trialled in the study was shown to be a successful way of sequencing and managing the teaching of mental computation strategies and related number sense understandings to Year 3 students. This study was conducted in one <b>classroom,</b> with one <b>teacher</b> in one school. The strength of this study was the depth of teacher support provided made possible by the particular method of the professional development, and the depth of analysis of the process. In another school, or with another teacher, this might not have been as successful. While I set out to change my practice as an education advisor I did not expect the depth of learning I experienced in terms of my knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and practices as an educator of teachers. This study has changed the way in which I plan to work as an education advisor in the future...|$|R
