5|$|<b>Cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> is a clear, {{colourless}} {{transcellular fluid}} that circulates around {{the brain in}} the subarachnoid space, in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord. It also fills some gaps in the subarachnoid space, known as subarachnoid cisterns. The four ventricles, two lateral, a third, and a fourth ventricle, all contain choroid plexus that produces <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid.</b> The third ventricle lies in the midline and {{is connected to the}} lateral ventricles. A single duct, the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral apertures, drain the <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns. From here, <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid mater and pia mater.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> varies by size and species. In humans and other mammals, <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid,</b> produced, circulating, and reabsorbed {{in a similar}} manner to humans, and with a similar function, turns over at a rate of 3–5 times a day. Problems with CSF {{circulation}} leading to hydrocephalus occur in other animals.|$|E
5|$|A {{spontaneous}} <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> leak is one {{of several}} types of <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E

40|$|Immunoprecipitation {{methods were}} used to analyze sera and <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> from {{patients}} with multiple sclerosis for measles virus-specific antibodies. The sera contained antibodies against all virus antigens except the matrix polypeptide.

5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{produces}} roughly 500mL of <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> per day, {{at a rate}} {{of about}} 25mL an hour. This transcellular fluid is constantly reabsorbed, so that only 125–150mL is present at any one time.|$|E
5|$|The first theory, that of {{increased}} production of <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid,</b> was proposed in early {{descriptions of the}} disease. However, there is no experimental data that supports a role for this process in IIH.|$|E
40|$|Between January and June 1963, 45 {{children}} were hospitalized with mumps meningoencephalitis. Of 39 patients with laboratory evidence of mumps infection, 24 had parotitis and 15 showed no salivary gland involvement. <b>Cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> from 18 of 40 patients yielded mumps virus by inoculation of rhesus monkey kidney cultures; 33 subjects, including 12 of the 18 virus excretors, showed rising or {{elevated levels of}} mumps antihemagglutinin during convalescence. Between May 1959 and June 1963, mumps virus was recovered from <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> of 50 of 126 cases of mumps meningoencephalitis; virus isolation rates were highest during the peak incidence of mumps meningoencephalitis in winter and early spring...|$|R

40|$|We {{determined}} immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass concentrations {{and studied}} their distributions in the <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> of patients suffering from multiple sclerosis, other inflammatory neurological diseases, and non-inflammatory {{diseases of the}} nervous system in comparison with a control group. In addition, the four subclass concentrations were measured in serum specimens of the multiple sclerosis and control groups. These data were correlated with the extent of local IgG synthesis in the subarachnoid spaces of the patients belonging to the different groups. We found a selective elevation of the IgG 1 subclass in the <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> of multiple sclerosis patients, and there was only a very small overlap of the IgG 1 ranges of the multiple sclerosis and control groups. No major differences were detected between the IgG subclass distributions in different courses of multiple sclerosis nor between multiple sclerosis and control sera. The group with non-inflammatory diseases showed a uniform elevation of all four subclasses and a greater overlap with the normal range. This latter feature was combined with an elevated IgG 1 concentration in the group with other inflammatory diseases. It is concluded that locally synthesized IgG in the <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> of multiple sclerosis patients consists mainly of IgG 1...|$|R
5|$|Emphasis in Alzheimer's {{research}} {{has been placed on}} diagnosing the condition before symptoms begin. A number of biochemical tests have been developed to attempt earlier detection. One such test involves the analysis of <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> for beta-amyloid or tau proteins, both total tau protein and phosphorylated tau181P protein concentrations.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} in symptom control is {{drainage}} of <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> by lumbar puncture. If necessary, this may be performed {{at the same time}} as a diagnostic LP (such as done in search of a CSF infection). In some cases, this is sufficient to control the symptoms, and no further treatment is needed.|$|E
5|$|When cranial CSF leak is {{suspected}} because of {{discharge from the}} nose or ear that is potentially CSF, the fluid can be collected and tested with a beta-2 transferrin assay. This test can positively identify if the fluid is <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid.</b>|$|E
40|$|A diphasic medium, Trans-Isolate medium, was {{developed}} for the transport of primary cultures of <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> from patients with bacterial meningitis. It consists of a charcoal-starch agar slant and soybean-casein digest-gelatin broth buffered at pH 7. 2 with 0. 1 M 3 -(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid buffer. In the laboratory, this medium supported the growth and survival of stock cultures of Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae for at least 3 months. Under field conditions in Africa, <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> from patients suspected of having bacterial meningitis were inoculated directly onto plates of chocolate agar medium and into bottles of Trans-Isolate medium. An etiological agent was isolated from 52 spinal fluids by direct plating. After shipment to Atlanta, Ga., 2 to 4 weeks later, the same etiological agents were recovered from 38 bottles of Trans-Isolate medium...|$|R
40|$|Extracellular vesicles (EVs) {{have emerged}} as a {{promising}} biomarker platform for glioblastoma patients. However, the optimal method for quantitative assessment of EVs in clinical bio-fluid remains a point of contention. Multiple high-resolution platforms for quantitative EV analysis have emerged, including methods grounded in diffraction measurement of Brownian motion (NTA), tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS), vesicle flow cytometry (VFC), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Here we compared quantitative EV assessment using <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> derived from glioblastoma patients using these methods. For EVs 150 nm in diameter), NTA consistently detected lower number of EVs relative to TRPS. These results unveil the strength and pitfalls of each quantitative method alone for assessing EVs derived from clinical <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> and suggest that thoughtful synthesis of multi-platform quantitation {{will be required to}} guide meaningful clinical investigations...|$|R
40|$|Fluids {{in which}} Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} are seldom found, such as pleural and cerebrospinal liquids, are good candidates {{to be studied}} using PCR techniques. We detail our experience with a PCR assay applied to pleural and <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> using the primer MPB 64. Seventy three specimens were analyzed: 30 pleural fluids (PF), 26 pleural biopsies (PB) and 17 <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> (CSF). The gold standard for the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was the positive culture for M. tuberculosis in CSF. Tuberculous pleural effusion was diagnosed when cultures of PF and/or PB were positive for M. tuberculosis, or the PB histology showed granulomas. Our results, compared to the gold standards employed, showed a sensitivity of 70 %, specificity of 88 %, positive predictive value of 82 % and negative predictive value of 80 %. The high specificity of the MPB 64 fragment while still retaining a good sensitivity makes it very well suited for pleural and cerebrospinal tuberculosis diagnosis...|$|R
5|$|René Descartes {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} dualism to tackle {{the issue of the}} brain's relation to the mind. He suggested that the pineal gland was where the mind interacted with the body after recording the brain mechanisms responsible for circulating <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid.</b> This dualism likely provided impetus for later anatomists to further explore the relationship between the anatomical and functional aspects of brain anatomy.|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS afflicts 5 out {{of every}} 100,000 people. On average, the {{condition}} is developed {{at the age of}} 42, and women are twice as likely as men to develop the condition. Some people with SCSFLS chronically leak <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> despite repeated attempts at patching, leading to long-term disability due to pain. SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand in 1938 and by American physician Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The Edwin Smith Papyrus, {{an ancient}} Egyptian medical {{treatise}} {{written in the}} 17th century BC, contains the earliest recorded reference to the brain. The hieroglyph for brain, occurring eight times in this papyrus, describes the symptoms, diagnosis, and prognosis of two traumatic injuries to the head. The papyrus mentions the external surface of the brain, the effects of injury (including seizures and aphasia), the meninges, and <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid.</b>|$|E
50|$|Various {{treatment}} {{methods have been}} tried in the past, including the extraction of <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> from the cyst, fibrin glue injection and the complete or partial removal of cyst. Epidurals can provide temporary relief but are not generally recommended as they can cause cysts to enlarge. Extraction of fluid can provide limited or no relief depending on rate the cysts refill {{and the need to}} repeat the procedure. Removal of the cyst results in irreversible damage to the intersecting spinal nerve. Although fibrin-glue therapy initially had been thought to be a promising therapy in the treatment of these cysts, there have been multiple problems associated with the fibrin glue therapy including seepage of fibrin. It is no longer recommended for use at present by the Health Department in some countries and neurosurgeons previously performing the procedures. Nevertheless, all types of surgical treatment pose common risks, including neurological deficits, infection and inflammation, spinal headache, urinary disturbances, and leakage of <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids.</b>|$|R
40|$|A basic, extractable, indolic type of compound, {{which was}} derivatized with heptafluorobutyric {{anhydride}} and pyridine, {{was obtained from}} the <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> of patients with acute tuberculous meningitis. The compound was detected by frequency-pulsed, modulated electron capture gas-liquid chromatography, and it was tentatively identified by mass spectrometry as 3 -(2 '-ketohexyl) indoline. The compound was found to be valuable for differentiating between tuberculous, cryptococcal, and aseptic meningitides...|$|R
40|$|Enteroviruses were {{specifically}} {{detected in}} crude clinical specimens or in cell cultures {{in which the}} viruses were amplified by dot hybridization by using poliovirus type 1 -derived, subgenomic radiolabeled cRNA probes (riboprobes). The sensitivity of this test varied from 2. 5 to 33 %, when clinical specimens without cell culture were examined, and was about 85 % in cell culture lysates. The specificity of the test was 90 to 100 %. The riboprobe corresponding to the 5 '-noncoding sequence specifically detected the majority of enteroviruses (56 of 57 tested); the riboprobe derived from the VPI capsid region hybridized with the three poliovirus serotypes and with some coxsackieviruses type A and with echovirus type 7. Echovirus 22 did not hybridize with any riboprobe. In stool specimens, nasal aspirates, and <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> from patients with meningitis, only one type of virus was identified in different clinical samples from the same patient by the seroneutralization test. Hybridization allowed the detection of enteroviral RNAs easily in stool specimens and nasal aspirates but with a low efficiency in <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> without amplification of the viruses in cell cultures...|$|R
5|$|The {{cause of}} IIH is not known. The Monro-Kellie rule {{states that the}} {{intracranial}} pressure {{is determined by the}} amount of brain tissue, <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> (CSF) and blood inside the bony cranial vault. Three theories therefore exist as to why the pressure might be raised in IIH: an excess of CSF production, increased volume of blood or brain tissue, or obstruction of the veins that drain blood from the brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{contains the}} ventricles where the <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> is produced and circulated. Below the corpus callosum is the septum pellucidum, a membrane {{that separates the}} lateral ventricles. Beneath the lateral ventricles is the thalamus and {{to the front and}} below this is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus leads on to the pituitary gland. At the back of the thalamus is the brainstem.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally {{detected in the}} blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.|$|E
40|$|A {{total number}} of 218 <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids</b> obtainedfrom {{children}} with aseptic meningitis III Tehran, were studied by attempts at virus isolation. All specimens were inoculated at least into three different cell systems. This investigation ended in isolation of 37 strains of viral agent, which are divided as following: 2 strains of poliovirus, 11 strains of coxsackie B virus, 8 strains of ECHOvirus, 11 strains of mumps virus and 5 strains of non identified VIrUSes...|$|R

5|$|<b>Cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|During phylogenesis, <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluid</b> {{is present}} within the neuraxis before it circulates.

In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, the CSF is present in it. Absorption of CSF is seen in amniotes and more complex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural veins in absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller role.|$|E

Body fluid drug concentrations were determined by the use of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). On day 7, mean voriconazole concentrations of plasma, peritoneal, synovial and <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids,</b> aqueous humor, epithelial lining fluid (ELF), and urine were 1. 47 ± 0. 63, 0. 61 ± 0. 22, 0. 70 ± 0. 20, 0. 62 ± 0. 26, 0. 55 ± 0. 32, 79. 45 ± 69. 4, and 1. 83 ± 0. 44 μg/mL respectively. Mean voriconazole concentrations in the plasma, peritoneal, synovial and <b>cerebrospinal</b> <b>fluids,</b> aqueous humor, ELF and urine on day 14 were 1. 60 ± 0. 37, 1. 02 ± 0. 27, 0. 86 ± 0. 25, 0. 64 ± 0. 21, 0. 68 ± 0. 13, 47. 76 ± 45. 4 and 3. 34 ± 2. 17 respectively.
