Also, studies of conformational changes of complexes, {{in connection with}} their function, are gaining ground. <b>Conformational</b> variability <b>analysis</b> is usually done by classifying images {{in a number of}} discrete classes supposedly representing all conformational states present in the specimen. However, discrete classes cannot be meaningfully defined when the conformational change is continuous (the specimen contains a continuum of states instead of a few discrete states).

One commonly cited example {{of the use of}} <b>conformational</b> <b>analysis</b> is a bi-molecular elimination reaction (E2). This reaction proceeds most readily when the nucleophile attacks the species that is antiperiplanar to the leaving group. A molecular orbital analysis of this phenomenon suggest that this conformation provides the best overlap between the electrons in the R-H σ bonding orbital that is undergoing nucleophilic attack and the empty σ* antibonding orbital of the R-X bond that is being broken. By exploiting this effect, <b>conformational</b> <b>analysis</b> can be used to design molecules that possess enhanced reactivity.|$|E
40|$|Fc gamma receptors, and in {{particular}} genetic variation in these receptors, are important in disorders of hose defense, immunohematologic disease, and systemic autoimmune diseases. We investigated the His-Arg (CAT/CGT) polymorphism at codon 131 of the Fc gamma receptor IIA gene, which influences ligand binding by the receptor. Previously, individuals had been classified phenotypically {{on the basis of}} differential binding of murine immunoglobulin G 1, but the Fc gamma receptor IIA genotype distribution has not been reported. We used selective PCR-based sequence analysis of genomic DNA to determine the distribution in healthy individuals. For African-Americans, the genotype distribution was determined to be A/A (14 %), A/G (60 %), and G/G (26 %); for Caucasian Americans, the distribution was A/A (30 %), A/G (51 %), and G/G (19 %). These data correlate well with phenotypic data. We implemented a nonradioactive single-stranded <b>conformational</b> polymorphism <b>analysis</b> to rapidly identify all three genotypes.

40|$|<b>Conformational</b> gel <b>analysis</b> and {{graphics}} systematically identifies and evaluates plausible {{alternatives to the}} side chain conformations found by conventional peptide or protein structure determination methods. The proposed analysis determines the populations of side chain rotational isomers and the probability distribution of these populations. The following steps are repeated for each side chain of a peptide or protein: first, extract the local molecular mechanics of side chain rotational isomerization from a single representative global conformation; second, expand the predominant set of rotational isomers to include all probable rotational isomers down to those that constitute just {{a small percentage of}} the population; and third, evaluate the constraints vicinal coupling constants and NOESY cross relaxation rates place on rotational isomer populations. In this article we apply <b>conformational</b> gel <b>analysis</b> to the cobalt glycyl-leucine dipeptide and detail the steps necessary to generalize the analysis to other amino acid side chains in other peptides and proteins. For a side chain buried within a protein interior, it is noteworthy that the set of probable rotational isomers may contain one or more rotational isomers that are not identified by conventional NMR structure determination methods. In cases such as this the conformational gel graphics fully accounts for the interplay of molecular mechanics and NMR data constraints on the population estimates. The analysis is particularly suited to identifying side chain rotational isomers that constitute {{a small percentage of the}} population, but nevertheless might be structurally and functionally very significant.

50|$|One of {{the primary}} methods for {{evaluating}} chemical stability and energetics is <b>conformational</b> <b>analysis.</b> Physical organic chemists use <b>conformational</b> <b>analysis</b> to evaluate {{the various types of}} strain present in a molecule to predict reaction products. Strain can be found in both acyclic and cyclic molecules, manifesting itself in diverse systems as torsional strain, allylic strain, ring strain, and syn-pentane strain. A-values provide a quantitative basis for predicting the conformation of a substituted cyclohexane, an important class of cyclic organic compounds whose reactivity is strongly guided by conformational effects. The A-value is the difference in the Gibbs' free energy between the axial and equatorial forms of substituted cyclohexane, and by adding together the A-values of various substituents it is possible to quantitatively predict the preferred conformation of a cyclohexane derivative.|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structures of}} the carboxyl-terminal regions of the P 21 protein products of the human Harvey (Ha), Kirsten (KiA and KiB), and neuroblastoma (N) RAS oncogenes and various mutants have been determined by using <b>conformational</b> energy <b>analysis.</b> The carboxyl-terminal region of P 21 has been strongly implicated in the binding of the protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane without which the protein is inactive. The only invariant residue in this region is Cys- 186, which {{is necessary for the}} post-translational addition of palmitic acid. The surrounding sequences of the active native proteins differ considerably. Nevertheless, certain amino acid substitutions in this region are known to eliminate membrane binding and protein activity, suggesting that there is a conserved common structural feature in this region in the native proteins that is disrupted in the mutant proteins. <b>Conformational</b> energy <b>analysis</b> shows that the four native P 21 proteins have a common structure {{in the form of an}} alpha-helix for the terminal pentapeptide. A mutant, pBW 277, that fails to bind to the membrane and is inactive cannot adopt an alpha-helical structure in this region because of a proline at position 188. Another mutant, pBW 766, that retains membrane binding and activity, on the other hand, retains the preference for an alpha-helical conformation in the terminal pentapeptide. These findings suggest that, despite various amino acid sequences in this region, the carboxyl-terminal pentapeptides of the P 21 proteins form a distinctive structural domain that must have an alpha-helical structure for membrane binding and intracellular activity...|$|R

40|$|Background: Different {{mutations}} in the 1 A-subunit {{of the brain}} P/Q-type calcium channel gene (CACNA 1 A) are responsible for familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), episodic ataxia type 2, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA 6). Missense and splice site mutations {{have been found in}} FHM and episodic ataxia type 2, respectively, whereas a CAG repeat in the CACNA 1 A gene was found expanded in patients with SCA 6. Objective: To identify the disease causing mutation in a large family of patients with phenotypes of hemiplegic migraine with or without cerebellar signs or permanent cerebellar ataxia without migraine inherited in a dominant manner. Patients and Methods: We examined 15 patients from a large family identified through a systematic survey of hereditary ataxias being conducted in Portugal. Linkage analysis was performed with CACNA 1 A gene markers, and mutation analysis was performed by single strand <b>conformational</b> polymorphism <b>analysis</b> and sequencing. Results: Genetic linkage analysis with CACNA 1 A intragenic markers showed positive LOD scores. The maximal LOD score was obtained with the polymorphic CAG repeat (Zmax= 4. 47, = 0). By single-strand <b>conformational</b> polymorphism <b>analysis,</b> a shift in exon 13 of the CACNA 1 A gene was detected in all patients. AG-to-A substitution was then identified, resulting in an arginine-to-glutamine change at codon 583 of this calcium channel 1 A-subunit. Conclusions: The disease-causing mutation in this family was identified, showing that a unique mutation in the CACNA 1 A gene causes several phenotypes, including those of SCA 6 and FHM, thus suggesting that SCA 6 and FHM are not only allelic diseases but are the same disorder with a large phenotypic variability.
