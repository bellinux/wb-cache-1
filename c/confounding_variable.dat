This has fluctuated significantly over the decades. Simonsohn found that although Walter and Dennis are of near-identical popularity in a large sample of US first names of living people, Walter is a relatively old-fashioned name. He suggested that when Pelham et al. found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with the letters [...] "Den" [...] compared to with [...] "Wal", they had overlooked that people named Walter would tend to be old, {{and more likely to}} be retired. Baby-name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more [...] "Den" [...] dentists than [...] "Wal" [...] than implicit egotism.Using both a different data set (TwitterandGoogle+accounts) and a different statistical analysis, Kooti, Magno, and Weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a job matching their name initials.|$|E
2500|$|The {{paradoxical}} {{conclusion is}} that treatment A is more effective when used on small stones, and also when used on large stones, yet treatment B is more effective when considering both sizes at the same time. In this example, the [...] "lurking" [...] variable (or <b>confounding</b> <b>variable)</b> is {{the severity of the}} case (represented by the doctors' treatment decision trend of favoring B for less severe cases), which was not previously known to be important until its effects were included.|$|E

One {{example of a}} questionnaire is BASS; it is a 9-item subscale of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. It uses a rating scale from −2 to +2 and assesses eight body areas and attributes and overall appearance (face, hair, lower torso, mid-torso, upper torso, muscle tone, height, and weight).

For instance, [...] "Acquiescent response style (ARS), or the tendency to agree with items on a survey, is more common among individuals from Asian and African cultures." ...|$|E
30|$|Five <b>confounding</b> <b>variables,</b> i.e., gender, years lived abroad, years {{worked with}} {{cultural}} outgroup members, age, and acculturation strategies, {{were found to}} act significantly {{in at least two}} of the independent-dependent variable associations and to correlate with the dependent variables in those associations. In this section, the results for each of these <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> are scrutinized in light of findings about the same variables in the literature, with the goal of gaining deeper insight into the relationship between these <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> and the acculturation outcomes of interest in this paper. Moreover, the implications of the recurring significance of these <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> are considered, and recommendations offered for future research.|$|R
30|$|Finally, to {{gain insight}} into how the <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> {{associated}} with the dependent measures, {{in a series of}} post-hoc tests, one-way ANOVAs (for categorical variables) and correlations (for continuous variables) were utilized to ascertain the significance and directionality of each <b>confounding</b> <b>variable’s</b> association with its dependent variable.|$|R
30|$|For outgroup attitude, when {{comparing}} nationality’s semipartial correlation {{on its own}} and with that {{of all of the}} <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> at once, calculations indicated that 79.5 % of the variance associated with nationality was accounted for by the <b>confounding</b> <b>variables.</b> After this shared variance was removed from the effect, the national difference was no longer significant. In the model with all of the <b>confounding</b> <b>variables,</b> 82.8 % of the variance associated with nationality was accounted for by the <b>confounding</b> <b>variables,</b> and once this shared variance was removed, the national difference for ingroup bias was no longer significant. In the model for investiture, 27.0 % of the variance associated with nationality was shared by level of education, and there was a minimal confounding effect, as nationality was significant at p[*]<[*]. 01 in both steps and the beta values were almost unchanged. For job effectiveness, 99.9 % of the variance associated with nationality was accounted for by the <b>confounding</b> <b>variables,</b> and once this shared variance was removed, the effect of nationality was no longer significant.|$|R
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{correlation}} is particularly noteworthy {{for the potential}} confusion it can cause. Statistical analysis of a data set often reveals that two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary together, {{as if they were}} connected. For example, a study of annual income that also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated; however, {{they may or may not}} be the cause of one another. The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable or <b>confounding</b> <b>variable.</b> For this reason, there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables. (See Correlation does not imply causation.) ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{assertions that}} race affects {{the rate of}} SLE. However, a 2010 review of studies which {{correlate}} race and SLE identified several sources of systematic and methodological error, indicating that the connection between race and SLE may be spurious. For example, studies show that social support is a modulating factor which buffers against SLE-related damage and maintains physiological functionality. Studies have not been conducted to determine whether people of different racial backgrounds receive differing levels of social support. If there is a difference, this could act as a <b>confounding</b> <b>variable</b> in studies correlating race and SLE. Another caveat to note when examining studies about SLE is that symptoms are often self-reported. This process introduces additional sources of methodological error. Studies have shown that self-reported data is affected by {{more than just the}} patients experience with the disease- social support, the level of helplessness, and abnormal illness-related behaviors also factor into a self-assessment. Additionally, other factors like the degree of social support that a person receives, socioeconomic status, health insurance, and access to care can contribute to an individual’s disease progression. Racial differences in lupus progression have not been found in studies that control for the socioeconomic status [...] of participants. Studies that control for the SES of its participants have found that non-white people have more abrupt disease onset compared to white people and that their disease progresses more quickly. Non-white patients often report more hematological, serosal, neurological, and renal symptoms. However, the severity of symptoms and mortality are both similar in white and non-white patients. Studies that report different rates of disease progression in late-stage SLE are most likely reflecting differences in socioeconomic status and the corresponding access to care. [...] The people who receive medical care have often accrued less disease-related damage and {{are less likely to be}} below the poverty line. Additional studies have found that education, marital status, occupation, and income create a social context which contributes to disease progression.|$|E

Two hundred sequentially reported ADR's were included in this study. An independent researcher used algorithms, while an expert panel assessed the same reports using the GI, both aimed at evaluating causality. Reports were divided into three groups according to the presence, absence or lack of information on <b>confounding</b> <b>variables.</b> For the total sample, observed agreements between decisional algorithms compared with GI varied from 21 % to 56 %, average of 47 %. When <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> were taken into account, agreements varied between 41 % and 69 %, average of 58 %; 8 % and 65 %, average of 46 % and 15 % and 53 %, average of 42 % accordingly to the absence, lack of information or presence of <b>confounding</b> <b>variables,</b> respectively. The extend of reproducibility beyond chance was low for the total sample (average Kappa =  0. 26) and within the groups considered. The overall observed agreement between algorithm and GI was moderate although poorly different from chance, <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> being a shortcoming of algorithms ability in assessing causality.

50|$|When {{this theory}} was first proposed, {{it was not}} well {{accepted}} and was met with much skepticism. The main criticism was that <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> such as environmental factors could attribute {{to many of the}} chronic diseases such that low birth weight alone should not be dictated as an independent risk factor. Subsequent research studies supporting the theory attempted to adjust these environmental factors and in turn, provided more convincing results with minimal <b>confounding</b> <b>variables.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Metabolomics is an {{emerging}} high-throughput approach to systems biology, but data analysis tools are lacking {{compared to other}} systems level disciplines such as transcriptomics and proteomics. Metabolomic data analysis requires a normalization step to remove systematic effects of <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> on metabolite measurements. Current tools may not correctly normalize every metabolite when the relationships between each metabolite quantity and fixed-effect <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> are different, or {{for the effects of}} random-effect <b>confounding</b> <b>variables.</b> Linear mixed models, an established methodology in the microarray literature, offer a standardized and flexible approach for removing the effects of fixed- and random-effect <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> from metabolomic data. Findings Here we present a simple menu-driven program, “MetabR”, designed to aid researchers with no programming background in statistical analysis of metabolomic data. Written in the open-source statistical programming language R, MetabR implements linear mixed models to normalize metabolomic data and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test treatment differences. MetabR exports normalized data, checks statistical model assumptions, identifies differentially abundant metabolites, and produces output files to help with data interpretation. Example data are provided to illustrate normalization for common <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> and to demonstrate the utility of the MetabR program. Conclusions We developed MetabR as a simple and user-friendly tool for implementing linear mixed model-based normalization and statistical analysis of targeted metabolomic data, which helps to fill a lack of available data analysis tools in this field.

Among 2, 394 asthma and COPD patients included in the analyses, the LABA ever-users were considerably older than never-users, but cardiovascular co-morbidity was equally prevalent (19. 9 % vs. 19. 9 %). Adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity status did not affect the crude risk ratio (RR) for mortality: crude RR 1. 19 (95 % CI 0. 93 – 1. 51) versus RR 1. 19 (95 % CI 0. 94 – 1. 50) after adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity. However, after adjustment for age (RR 0. 95, 95 % CI 0. 76 – 1. 19), additional adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity status did affect the association between LABA use and mortality (RR 1. 01, 95 % CI 0. 80 – 1. 26). <b>Confounding</b> <b>variables</b> should not be discarded based on balanced distributions among exposure groups, because residual confounding due to the omission of <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> from the adjustment model can be relevant...|$|R
