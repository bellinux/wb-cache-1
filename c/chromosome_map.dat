50|$|BacMap is a freely {{available}} web-accessible database containing fully annotated, fully zoomable {{and fully}} searchable chromosome maps {{from more than}} 2500 prokaryotic (archaebacterial and eubacterial) species. BacMap was originally developed in 2005 to address the challenges of viewing and navigating through the growing numbers of bacterial genomes that were being generated through large-scale sequencing efforts. Since it was first introduced, the number of bacterial genomes in BacMap has grown by more than 15X. Essentially BacMap functions as an on-line visual atlas of microbial genomes. All of the genome annotations in BacMap were generated through the BASys genome annotation system. BASys is a widely used microbial annotation infrastructure that performs comprehensive bionformatic analyses on raw (or labeled) bacterial genome sequence data. All of the genome (chromosome) maps in BacMap were constructed using the program known as CGView. CGView is a popular visualization program for generating interactive, web-compatible circular chromosome maps (Fig. 1). Each <b>chromosome</b> <b>map</b> in BacMap is extensively hyperlinked and each chromosome image can be interactively navigated, expanded and rotated using navigation buttons or hyperlinks. All identified genes in a BacMap <b>chromosome</b> <b>map</b> are colored according to coding directions and when sufficiently zoomed-in, gene labels are visible. Each gene label on a BacMap genome map is also hyperlinked to a 'gene card' (Fig. 2). The gene cards provide detailed information about the corresponding DNA and protein sequences. Each genome map in BacMap is searchable via BLAST and a gene name/synonym search.|$|E

40|$|In Drosophila, the {{availability}} of polytene <b>chromosome</b> <b>maps</b> and of sets of probes covering most regions of the chromosomes allows a direct comparison {{of the organization of}} the genome in different species. In this work, we report the localization, in Drosophila virilis, D. montana, and D. novamexicana, of > 100 bacteriophage P 1 clones containing ~ 65 kilobase inserts of genomic DNA from D. virilis. Each clone hybridizes with a single euchromatic site in either chromosome 1 or chromosome 3 in D. virilis. From these data, it is possible to estimate the minimum number of inversions required to transform the map positions of the probes in one species into the map positions of the same probes in a related species. The data indicate that, in the D. virilis species group, the X chromosome has up to four times the number of inversions as are observed in chromosome 3. The first photographic polytene <b>chromosome</b> <b>maps</b> for D. montana and D. novamexicana are also presented...|$|R
50|$|B. subtilis {{is a model}} {{organism}} used {{to study}} bacterial chromosome replication. Replication of the single circular chromosome initiates at a single locus, the origin (oriC). Replication proceeds bidirectionally and two replication forks progress in clockwise and counterclockwise directions along the chromosome. Chromosome replication is completed when the forks reach the terminus region, which is positioned opposite to the origin on the <b>chromosome</b> <b>map.</b> The terminus region contains several short DNA sequences (Ter sites) that promote replication arrest. Specific proteins mediate all the steps in DNA replication. Comparison between the proteins involved in chromosomal DNA replication in B. subtilis and in Escherichia coli reveals similarities and differences. Although the basic components promoting initiation, elongation, and termination of replication are well-conserved, some important differences can be found (such as one bacterium missing proteins essential in the other). These differences underline the diversity in the mechanisms and strategies that various bacterial species have adopted {{to carry out the}} duplication of their genomes.|$|E
5000|$|One of Sturtevant’s {{principal}} contributions was {{his introduction}} to the concept that the frequency of crossing-over between two genes could help determine their proximity on a linear genetic map. His experiments determined that the frequency of double crossing over {{can be used to}} deduce gene order. He demonstrated this concept by constructing crosses of three segregating genes, called [...] "three-factor crosses". He found that using three genes as opposed to two provided most accurate information about gene order on chromosome. With this system, Sturtevant discovered that double crossing-over occurs at frequency of equal to or less than product of two single crossing over frequencies. He also surmised that unequal crossing-over was possibly a main force of evolution. [...] "Sturtevant... elaborated on these ideas by incorporating the conception of linear arrangement and by constructing the first <b>chromosome</b> <b>map.</b> Double crossing over and interference were deductions that arose from this result" [...] (Sturtevant, An Introduction to Genetics p. 361).|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} synteny between A(t) and A polyploid wheat genomes belonging to different evolutionary lines (Timopheevi and Emmer), saturation of <b>chromosome</b> <b>maps</b> of Triticum timopheevii A(t) genome by molecular markers has been conducted. Totally, 179 EST-SSR and 48 genomic SSR-markers {{have been used}} with the following integration of 13 and 7 markers correspondingly into <b>chromosome</b> <b>maps</b> of A(t) genome. ESTSSR showed higher transferability and lower polymorphism than genomic SSR markers. The <b>chromosome</b> <b>maps</b> designed were compared to <b>maps</b> of homoeologous <b>chromosome</b> group of the T. aestivum A genome. No disturbances of colinearity, i. e., {{of the order of}} markers within the chromosome segments on which they had been previously mapped, were observed. According to the quantity assessment of markers amplifying in homoeologous chromosomes, the maximum divergence was detected in two groups (4 A(t) / 4 A and 3 A(t) / 3 A) among the seven chromosomes examined in the A (t) and A genomes. Comparison of molecular genetic mapping results with the published results of studying meiosis of F- 1 hybrids and the frequency of chromosomes substitution in introgressive T. aestivum x T. timopheevii lines suggest that individual chromosomes of the A(t) and A genomes evolve differently. Translocations were shown to introduce the major impact on the divergence of 4 A(t) / 4 A and 6 A(t) / 6 A chromosomes, while mutations of the primary DNA structure, on the divergence of homoeologous group 3 chromosomes. The level of reorganization of other chromosomes during the evolution in the A(t) and A genomes was significantly lower...|$|R
