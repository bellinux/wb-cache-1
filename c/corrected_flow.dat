At a certain IP compressor working line slope, the IP {{compressor outlet}} <b>corrected</b> <b>flow</b> remains constant. However, by adopting a shallower working line, the extra IP compressor pressure ratio at a given IP compressor entry <b>corrected</b> <b>flow</b> enables the IP compressor outlet <b>corrected</b> <b>flow</b> to decrease and match up with the falling HP compressor entry <b>corrected</b> <b>flow.</b> Unfortunately {{this can lead to}} a poor IP compressor surge margin at part flow.|$|E
50|$|At low intake temperatures, {{the engine}} tends {{to operate at}} maximum {{corrected}} speed or <b>corrected</b> <b>flow.</b> As intake temperature rises, a limit on (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature (SOT) takes effect, progressively reducing <b>corrected</b> <b>flow.</b> At even higher intake temperatures, a limit on compressor delivery temperature (T3) is invoked, which decreases both SOT and <b>corrected</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|E

40|$|Technical {{challenges}} of compressors for future rotorcraft engines {{are driven by}} engine-level and component-level requirements. Cycle analyses are used to highlight the engine-level challenges for 3000, 7500, and 12000 SHP-class engines, which include retention of performance and stability margin at low <b>corrected</b> <b>flows,</b> and matching compressor type, axial-flow or centrifugal, to the low <b>corrected</b> <b>flows</b> and high temperatures in the aft stages. At the component level: power-to-weight and efficiency requirements impel designs with lower inherent aerodynamic stability margin; and, optimum engine overall pressure ratios lead to small blade heights and the associated {{challenges of}} scale, particularly increased clearance-to-span ratios. The technical challenges associated with the aerodynamics of low <b>corrected</b> <b>flows</b> and stability management impel the compressor aero research and development efforts reviewed herein. These activities include development of simple models for clearance sensitivities to improve cycle calculations, full-annulus, unsteady Navier-Stokes simulations used to elucidate stall, its inception, and the physics of stall control by discrete tip-injection, development of an actuator-duct-based model for rapid simulation of nonaxisymmetric flow fields (e. g., due inlet circumferential distortion), advanced centrifugal compressor stage development and experimentation, and application of stall control in a T 700 engine...|$|R

Results Plotted above are the results of several off-design calculations, showing the effect of throttling a jet engine from its design point condition. This line {{is known as the}} compressor steady state (as opposed to transient) working line. Over most of the throttle range, the turbine system on a turbojet operates between choked planes. All the turbine throats are choked, as well as the final nozzle. Consequently, the turbine pressure ratio stays essentially constant. This implies a fixed [...] Since turbine rotor entry temperature, , usually falls with throttling, the temperature drop across the turbine system, , must also decrease. However, the temperature rise across the compression system, , is proportional to [...] Consequently, the ratio [...] must also fall, implying a decrease in the compression system pressure ratio. The non-dimensional (or <b>corrected</b> <b>flow)</b> at compressor exit tends to stay constant, because it sees, beyond the combustor, the constant <b>corrected</b> <b>flow</b> of the choked turbine. Consequently, there must be a decrease in compressor entry <b>corrected</b> <b>flow,</b> as compressor pressure ratio falls. Therefore, the compressor steady state working line has a positive slope, as shown above, on the RHS.|$|E

50|$|One main {{advantage}} of pre-cooling is that, {{for a given}} overall pressure ratio, {{there is a significant}} reduction in compressor delivery temperature (T3), which delays the onset of the T3 limit as flight speed increases.

50|$|At a given IP {{compressor}} pressure ratio, {{opening the}} blow-off valve forces the IP compressor entry <b>corrected</b> <b>flow</b> to increase, {{to a point}} where the IP compressor surge margin tends to be better. Effectively, opening the blow-off valve lowers the IP compressor working line. Any flow surplus to that demanded by the HP compressor passes through the blow-off valve into the bypass duct. The blow-off valve is normally only opened at throttled conditions, since it wastes energy.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} a method to calculate good quality user equilibrium assignments under time varying conditions.

This novel algorithm turns out to be convenient and logically plausible compared to the conventional [Frank, M., Wolfe, P., 1956. An algorithm for quadratic programming.
