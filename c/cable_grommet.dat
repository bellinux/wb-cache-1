5000|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>grommet</b> [...] is a tube or {{ring through}} which an {{electrical}} cable passes. They are usually made of rubber or metal.|$|E
40|$|Easily {{fabricated}} grommet {{composed of}} polytetrafluoroethylene cylinder, containing U-shaped channels equally spaced around periphery, {{is used in}} power cable connectors to relieve strain on <b>cables.</b> Utilization of <b>grommets</b> provides more ease in cable insertion and removal. Potential applications include wiring in large residential and commercial buildings...|$|R
40|$|Teflon grommet, cast in place, {{is easily}} {{installed}} and compatible with honeycomb structural integrity. After casting, grommet blank had only minimum hole size; however, opening can be enlarged by drilling to accommodate larger range of <b>cable</b> diameters. Since <b>grommet</b> is installed flush with adjacent mounting surfaces, it cannot fall out...|$|R
5000|$|The EeeBox PC uses an {{external}} power supply, {{but due to}} the low power requirements, this unit is physically smaller than most external computer laptop power supplies. At December 2008, the supplied UK power adapter is a small rectangular [...] "in-line" [...] block measuring approximately 30 mm Ã— 35 mm wide, and around 90 mm long (not including <b>cable</b> stress relief <b>grommets).</b>|$|R
50|$|For routing of {{standard}} cables and other electrical, pneumatic or hydraulic lines through machine, panel or enclosure walls, <b>cable</b> glands, self-sealing <b>grommets</b> or <b>cable</b> entry plates {{can be used}} to seal the cut-outs required for passing the cables through. This protects the inside of an enclosure or machine from dirt, dust or liquids.Cable glands and self-sealing grommets are usually designed for entering single or just a few cables. By utilising a cable entry plate, many cables with different diameters can be routed. Depending on the type, very high packing densities or ingress protection classes up to IP 67/68 (according to IEC 60529) can be achieved.|$|R
