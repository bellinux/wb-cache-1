40|$|Calcium-based sorbent can circularly capture low {{concentration}} CO_ 2 {{effectively in}} flue gas,and release high concentration CO_ 2 by raising temperature. But {{the disadvantage of}} Calcium-based sorbent was sintering seriously with the times of cyclic calcination/carbonation,so that Carbonation rate declined rapidly. If only using natural calcium-based sorbent as capture agent,the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>limestone</b> is too large. This paper {{was based on the}} flue gas in cement industry,and used attapulgite which is abundant in the nature and with the one dimensional structure to modified the surface of limestone,with the effect of anti-sintering and carbonation rate (X_N) was improved. The results showed that: attapulgite physical adsorption to CO_ 2 made contribution to the improvement of calcium-based sorbent carbonation rate (X_N),however,the contribution was less than the improvement of sintering resistance;carbonation rate (X_N) of attapulgite modified larger particle size sorbent was better; kept the particle size of calcium-based sorbent and reduced to particle size of purified attapulgite,its modified effect was further enhanced. </p...|$|E
40|$|EN] This paper {{presents}} a novel sorbent regeneration technique for post-combustion calcium looping CO 2 capture systems. The {{advantage of this}} technique {{is that it can}} drastically reduce the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>limestone</b> in the plant without affecting its efficiency and without the need for additional reagents. The method is based on the re-carbonation of carbonated particles circulating from the carbonator using pure CO 2 obtained from the gas stream generated in the calciner. The aim is to maintain the CO 2 carrying capacity of the sorbent close to optimum values for CaL post-combustion systems (around 0. 2). This is achieved by placing a small regeneration reactor between the carbonator and the calciner. This reactor increases slightly the conversion of CaO to carbonate so that it exceeds the so-called maximum CO 2 carrying capacity of the sorbent. This increase compensates for the loss of CO 2 carrying capacity that the solids undergo in the next calcination-carbonation cycle. Two series of experiments carried out in a thermogravimetric analyzer over 100 cycles of carbonation-recarbonation-calcination show that the inclusion of this recarbonation step is responsible for an increase in the residual CO 2 carrying capacity from 0. 07 to 0. 16. A conceptual design of the resulting capture system shows that a limestone make-up flow designed specifically for a CO 2 capture system can approach zero, when the solid sorbents purged from the CaL system are re-used to desulfurize the flue gas in the existing power plant.

30|$|Calcium {{hydroxide}} contents can {{be determined}} from reaction degree of binders. As shown in Fig.  5 b, plain cement has the highest calcium hydroxide (CH) content. On account <b>of</b> the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> calcium hydroxide from limestone reaction and dilution effect <b>of</b> <b>limestone,</b> limestone blended binary cement has a lower CH content than plain cement. The cement-slag-limestone ternary paste has a lowest CH content on account <b>of</b> the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> CH from both slag reaction and limestone reaction. The sequence of CH content is plain cement > limestone blended binary cement > slag blended binary cement > ternary paste. The calculation results from our model can reflect this sequence of CH content.|$|R

Aluminum is an {{essential}} material for the construction and development of national economy, however the GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions caused by its production have been noticed by China’s government gradually. In this study, the life cycle energy consumption and GHG emissions caused by the production of primary aluminum in different years in China were calculated, and the correlation between GHG emissions and some important factors i. e. resource consumption and procedure energy consumption was analyzed. The final results show that for GHG emissions, electricity is the major contributor that accounts for 68. 5 % of the total, followed by the emissions of anode effect and calcination <b>of</b> <b>limestone,</b> which accounts for 7. 9 % and 6. 8 % respectively, and the percentages other factors account for less than 6 %. The results also show that the calcination <b>of</b> <b>limestone,</b> combustion <b>of</b> coal gas and <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> electricity are the three main factors which have the largest correlation degree with GHG emissions, and their correlation degrees are 0. 96, 0. 94 and 0. 90 respectively. Therefore, decreasing the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> coal gas and improving {{the efficiency of the}} calcination <b>of</b> <b>limestone</b> are effective ways to decrease the GHG emissions of primary aluminum production...|$|R

Following a study of transportation costs and the drilling of several, continuously cored drill holes through the Paleozoic strata, Ontario Hydro and three Ontario government ministries undertook a feasibility study of the mining <b>of</b> <b>limestone</b> aggregate in the Toronto area.
