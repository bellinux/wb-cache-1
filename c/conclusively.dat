5|$|Felix {{came from}} the Frankish kingdom of Burgundy, {{although}} his name prevents historians from <b>conclusively</b> identifying his nationality. According to Bede, he was ordained in Burgundy.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{agree that}} the assassin of Governor Goebel will never be <b>conclusively</b> identified.|$|E
5|$|These {{findings}} are contested by Warnicke in several books and articles, {{and the evidence}} does not <b>conclusively</b> support either date.|$|E
5|$|Hire Purchase: The Lebanese Identity Card {{is used in}} {{establishing}} a persons identity when making hire purchase arrangements as it contains their digital picture and biometric information that <b>conclusively</b> establishes their identity {{in addition to their}} personal and residential information.|$|E
5|$|Insurance Claims: As {{a person}} needs {{to prove their}} {{identity}} {{in the event of}} any disaster for which they have to make insurance claims. The Lebanese Identity Card provides them with the necessary information they need to <b>conclusively</b> establish their identity.|$|E
5|$|No virus particles, bacteria, or fungi {{have been}} <b>conclusively</b> {{associated}} with prion diseases, although virus-like particles and Spiroplasma-like inclusions {{can be detected}} in some TSE cases, but not in controls (uninfected individuals).|$|E
5|$|Risk {{factors for}} the {{development}} of acne, other than genetics, have not been <b>conclusively</b> identified. Possible secondary contributors include hormones, infections, diet and stress. Studies investigating the impact of smoking on the incidence and severity of acne have been inconclusive. Sunlight and cleanliness are not associated with acne.|$|E
5|$|The {{literary}} scholar Yōichi Katagiri concluded, on {{the lack}} of surviving evidence, that, while it is possible that Narihira and Ono no Komachi knew each other and were lovers, there was no usable evidence to say <b>conclusively</b> either way.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test <b>conclusively</b> proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure and the blood pressure, may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, when Hooker Telescope was completed, the {{prevailing}} view still {{was that the}} Universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope, Edwin Hubble identified Cepheid variables in several spiral nebulae and in 1922–1923 proved <b>conclusively</b> that Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum among others, were entire galaxies outside our own, thus proving that Universe consists of multitude of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Glenn T. Seaborg, who {{devised the}} {{actinide}} concept that elements 89 to 103 formed an actinide series homologous to the lanthanide series from elements 57 to 71, predicted that element 103 (lawrencium) should be its final member {{and that the}} Lr3+ ion should be about as stable as Lu3+ in aqueous solution. It was not until decades later that element 103 was finally <b>conclusively</b> synthesized and this prediction was experimentally confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 another {{pristine}} underwater wreck {{was located}} during {{a survey by}} the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum. Two years later it was <b>conclusively</b> identified as the gundalow Spitfire; this site was listed on the National Register in 2008, and it has been named as part of the U.S. government's Save America's Treasures program.|$|E
5|$|In a 2012 {{review of}} {{pinniped}} taxonomy, Berta and Morgan Churchill suggested that, based on morphological and genetic criteria, there are 33 extant species and 29 subspecies of pinnipeds, although {{five of the}} latter lack sufficient support to be <b>conclusively</b> considered subspecies. They recommend that the genus Arctocephalus be limited to Arctocephalus pusillus, and they resurrected the name Arctophoca for several species and subspecies formerly placed in Arctocephalus. More than 50 fossil species have been described.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the specific amino acid codes, placeholders are used in cases where chemical or crystallographic analysis of a peptide or protein cannot <b>conclusively</b> determine {{the identity of a}} residue. They are also used to summarise conserved protein sequence motifs. The use of single letters to indicate sets of similar residues is similar to the use of abbreviation codes for degenerate bases.|$|E
5|$|In the 1st century AD {{the complex}} {{underwent}} a major expansion. At {{this time there}} was a gradual shift in focus from the major Preclassic Mundo Perdido complex to the North Acropolis, which was marked out as the new ceremonial centre of the city and received the first royal burials, so far not <b>conclusively</b> identified with named rulers.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that a well publicized debate over which daughter, Maria (according to Russian experts) or Anastasia (according to US experts), has been {{recovered from the}} second grave cannot be settled based upon the DNA results reported here. In {{the absence of a}} DNA reference from each sister, we can only <b>conclusively</b> identify Alexei – the only son of Nicholas and Alexandra.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September 2012 archaeologists {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} a battle-damaged skeleton suspected to be Richard's in the remains of his burial church in Leicester. On 4 February 2013, it was announced that DNA testing had <b>conclusively</b> identified ("beyond reasonable doubt") the remains as those of Richard. On Thursday 26 March 2015, these remains were ceremonially buried in Leicester Cathedral. On the following day the new royal tomb of Richard III was unveiled.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 1915, a Court of Inquiry was held, {{at first}} meeting in {{confidence}} {{but then in}} public sessions. It prepared a 450-page report dated 15 May 1915. Although extensive discord amongst both officers and men of the 5th Light Infantry was identified, {{the cause of the}} mutiny was not <b>conclusively</b> established. The focus of the report was on possible external German influences, plus internal regimental causes of the mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{shooting}} in Maribor was never <b>conclusively</b> established. Austrian sources attributed blame to Rudolf Maister, and referenced {{him in some}} accounts as the Butcher of Maribor. In Slovenia, by contrast, Maister remains well-regarded; numerous societies institutions and streets are named in his honour and he is commemorated in several monuments.|$|E
5|$|The Slatina crisis reverberated in {{the capital}} and posed {{problems}} for the Conservative cabinet of Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino. Reportedly, both the Minister of Agriculture Nicolae Fleva and the Minister of Justice Dissescu were ready to hand in their resignations. Bogdan-Pitești himself was arrested for sedition, but soon after checked himself into Filantropia Hospital. He averted sentencing when the prosecutors were unable to <b>conclusively</b> prove this involvement.|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} not been <b>conclusively</b> dated. Art {{historian}} André Grabar placed it in the 14th century, scholar Nikola Mavrodinov dated it to the 13th century, while archaeologist Krastyu Miyatev is {{of the opinion that}} both theories are equally likely. Architecture writer Stefan Stamov gives a possible range from the 12th to the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} affinity of an atom {{is the amount}} of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although {{electron affinity}} varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, nonmetals have more positive electron affinity values than metals. Chlorine most strongly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been measured <b>conclusively,</b> so {{they may or may not}} have slightly negative values.|$|E
5|$|The first protein to be sequenced was insulin, by Frederick Sanger, in 1949. Sanger {{correctly}} {{determined the}} {{amino acid sequence}} of insulin, thus <b>conclusively</b> demonstrating that proteins consisted of linear polymers of amino acids rather than branched chains, colloids, or cyclols. He won the Nobel Prize for this achievement in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the lead pipes found {{at the murder scene}} and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces of blood on the pipe from 46Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (blood group A) and Sandra Rivett's (B) blood. Hair belonging to Veronica Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Sandra Rivett. The pipe found inside the car had neither blood nor hair on it. Home Office scientists were unable to prove <b>conclusively</b> that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely. The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be <b>conclusively</b> linked. The letters written to Bill Shand-Kydd were stained with blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Michael Stoop had no blood on it, but it was later proven that the paper it was written on had been torn from a writing pad found in the Corsair's boot.|$|E
5|$|The {{head was}} <b>conclusively</b> seen on Westminster Hall {{as late as}} 1684, {{and it was on}} the south side of the Hall. Archaeological {{evidence}} also disproved its authenticity. The skull was pierced from the top, not from the bottom; and the skull had no trace of skin or hair, showing it had never been embalmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains were}} <b>conclusively</b> {{identified}} as Bormann's in 1998 when German authorities ordered genetic testing on {{fragments of the}} skull. The testing was led by Wolfgang Eisenmenger, Professor of Forensic Science at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Tests using DNA {{from one of his}} relatives identified the skull as that of Bormann. Bormann's remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered in the Baltic Sea on 16 August 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{review board}} {{determined}} that the electrical power momentarily failed at 23:30:55 GMT, and found evidence of several electric arcs in the interior equipment. They were unable to identify <b>conclusively</b> a single ignition source. They {{determined that the}} fire most likely started near {{the floor in the}} lower left section of the cabin, close to the Environmental Control Unit. It spread from the left wall of the cabin to the right, with the floor being affected only briefly.|$|E
5|$|There {{have not}} been any {{controlled}} studies on meth mouth, and several of its aspects are unclear. Although the condition has been popularized by media coverage and case reports, no systematic {{studies have been conducted}} to <b>conclusively</b> tie methamphetamine use to symptoms that are commonly described as meth mouth. There are few ties between dental scholars and those who study drug use, and it can be difficult for dental researchers to find methamphetamine users to study.|$|E
5|$|Citing {{the trust}} {{relationship}} between {{the federal government and}} the tribes, the Court held that removal treaties could only be enforced against the tribes by the federal government, not private parties (whether through self-help or through the courts). In other words, the federal government retained the discretion not to enforce such treaties. At the same time, the Court held that enrolled treaties are <b>conclusively</b> valid, and refused to consider the plaintiffs claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838) was fraudulent.|$|E
5|$|Complicating the picture, Reagan {{suffered}} {{an episode of}} head trauma in July 1989, five years before his diagnosis. After being thrown from a horse in Mexico, a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year. Nancy Reagan, citing what doctors told her, asserted that her husband's 1989 fall hastened the onset of Alzheimer's disease, although acute brain injury has not been <b>conclusively</b> proven to accelerate Alzheimer's or dementia. Reagan's one-time physician Daniel Ruge has said it is possible, but not certain, that the horse accident affected the course of Reagan's memory.|$|E
5|$|Grissom's {{spacecraft}} {{was recovered}} in 1999, but no further evidence was found which could <b>conclusively</b> {{explain how the}} explosive hatch release had occurred. Later, Guenter Wendt, pad leader for the early American manned space launches, wrote that he believed a small cover over the external release actuator was accidentally lost sometime during the flight or splashdown, and the T-handle may have been tugged by a stray parachute suspension line, or was perhaps damaged by the heat of re-entry and, after cooling upon splashdown, contracted and fired.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius' {{accession}} as Emperor {{did little}} to reduce the Persian threat. Heraclius began his reign by attempting {{to make peace with}} the Persians, since Phocas, whose actions were the original casus belli, had been overthrown. The Persians rejected these overtures, however, since their armies were widely victorious. According to historian Walter Kaegi, it is conceivable that the Persians' goal was to restore or even surpass the boundaries of the Achaemenid Empire by destroying the Byzantine empire, though because of the loss of Persian archives, no document survives to <b>conclusively</b> prove this.|$|E
5|$|However, further {{excavations}} {{revealed that}} the 8th-century temple was constructed over the remains of an older brick temple. According to Thirumoorthy, the garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum of the brick temple was filled with sand and covered with granite slabs upon which the newer temple was constructed. Sathyamurthy, Superintendent, ASI Chennai Circle, said that the brick temple could be dated to the Sangam period as the shrine faced north unlike modern temples which face either east or west. This proved <b>conclusively</b> that the temple was constructed before the 6th or 7th century AD when the shilpa shastras, the canonical texts of temple architecture, were written. Estimates {{of the age of}} the brick shrine range from 1700 to 2200 years.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the native}} Egyptian rulers {{installed}} by Esarhaddon {{were unable to}} retain full control of the whole country for long. Two years later, Taharqa returned from Nubia and seized control of a section of southern Egypt {{as far north as}} Memphis. Esarhaddon prepared to return to Egypt and once more eject Taharqa; however, he fell ill and died in his capital, Nineveh, before he left Assyria. His successor, Ashurbanipal, sent an Assyrian general named Sha-Nabu-shu with a small, but well trained army, which <b>conclusively</b> defeated Taharqa at Memphis and once more drove him from Egypt. Taharqa died in Nubia two years later.|$|E
5|$|If {{the church}} from the {{marginal}} note is equated with the Round Church, {{then it can}} be <b>conclusively</b> dated {{to no more than}} a few years before 907. While the church can be ascribed to no later than the 10th century, some scholars have suggested that it may have been constructed directly on top of a much earlier late Roman basilica due to its antiquated plan. A possible donor (ktetor) of at least part of the church's construction is a high-ranking church official (chartophylax) named Paul, who is mentioned in an inscription inside the church. The main part of the work was likely funded by Simeon, who may have acted as a chief sponsor.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Kilgour and Matas {{published}} {{an updated version}} of the report as a book, titled Bloody Harvest, The killing of Falun Gong for their organs. It contains new material and interviews, and is in two parts. The first section sets out the evidence; the second section details the reactions the final report received and the advocacy Matas and Kilgour undertook to end the abuse that they <b>conclusively</b> identified. That year, Kilgour and Matas also received the 2009 Human Rights Award by the German-based International Society for Human Rights; and were nominated for the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E
