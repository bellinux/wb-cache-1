50|$|The BT Ambassador is a {{telephone}} {{private branch exchange}} switchboard. Manufactured for BT by GEC, it was discontinued in 1991. There was a larger version called Senator. Both systems used proprietary phones, allowed direct access to outside lines (with lamp indication), had an intercom facility and allowed basic <b>call</b> <b>diversion.</b> Apart from this, there were few features, and these systems are now obsolete. Ambassador systems handled 1 line & 3 extensions or 2 lines and 4 extensions, while the Senator could handle 5 lines and 10 extensions, depending on the cards in the control unit.

50|$|Call forwarding, or <b>call</b> <b>diversion,</b> is a {{telephony}} {{feature of}} some telephone switching systems which redirects {{a telephone call}} to another destination, which may be, for example, a mobile telephone, voicemail box or another telephone number where the desired called party is available. Call forwarding was invented by Ernest J. Bonanno. In North America, the forwarded line usually rings once to remind the customer using call forwarding that the call is being redirected. More consistently, the forwarded line indicates its condition by stutter dial tone. Call forwarding typically can redirect incoming calls to any other domestic telephone number, but {{the owner of the}} forwarded line must pay any toll charges for forwarded calls. Call forwarding is often enabled by dialing *72 followed by the telephone number to which calls should be forwarded. Once someone answers, call forwarding is in effect. If no one answers or the line is busy, the dialing sequence must be repeated to effect call forwarding. Call forwarding is disabled by dialing *73. This feature requires a subscription from the telephone company. Also available in some areas is Remote Access to call forwarding, which permit the control over call forwarding from telephones other than the subscriber's telephone. VOIP and cable telephone systems also often allow call forwarding to be set up and directed via their web portals.|$|E

40|$|Conditional {{discontinuance}} {{of criminal}} prosecution is an institute that was introduced into Czech {{criminal procedure law}} {{more than twenty years}} ago. Over the years, this alternative way of handling criminal cases has become the most commonly used (in the last four years, the second most commonly used) means of all alternative ways <b>called</b> <b>diversions.</b> This diversion is used by both prosecutors and courts in cases of less serious criminal offenses. The point of conditional discontinuance of criminal prosecution is the decision of the prosecutor or the court not to initiate criminal court proceedings or cease them under certain conditions, the most important of them being the offender reimbursing the injured party for the damages caused by the crime. The goal of the author of this thesis is to briefly write about the history of alternative ways of handling criminal cases and their introduction into Czech criminal law, then to move on to specifically discussing the institute of conditional discontinuance of criminal prosecution, the conditions that must be met for its use, the benefits it brings into Czech criminal law and criminal proceedings and to compare it with other types of diversions, {{as well as with the}} use of the same institute in Slovak criminal law under slightly different conditions.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{conditional}} discontinuance of criminal prosecution. This institute {{is one of}} the alternative ways of handling the criminal case, which are collectively <b>called</b> <b>diversions.</b> Their theoretical basis is a concept called restorative justice. Conditional discontinuance of criminal prosecution is an institute of criminal procedure that is a significant manifestation of the subsidiarity of criminal repression. This institute represents the provision of certain privileges to the accused that lie {{in the fact that the}} criminal proceedings are not brought to its standard end in exchange for reimbursing the relationship with the victim, disturbed by the criminal offence. The thesis is divided into six chapters, which seek to render the chosen theme as well as its broader context. At thebeginning, attention is paid to the concept of restorative justice and the concept of diversions. The main part of this thesis is in the third chapter and is entirely exclusively devoted to conditional discontinuance of criminal prosecution. Author's goal is to cover all aspects of this concept and its application. The following chapter is devoted to other types of diversions.
