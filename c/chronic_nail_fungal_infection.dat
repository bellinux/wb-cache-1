The second most common <b>fungal</b> <b>infection</b> in Portugal is recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, with an estimated 150, 700 women (15 - 50  years of age) suffering from it every year. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected people, oral or oesophageal candidiasis rates were estimated to be 19. 5 and 16. 8 / 100, 000, respectively. Candidaemia affects 2. 19 / 100, 000 patients, in a total of 231 cases nationally. Invasive aspergillosis is less common than in other countries as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is uncommon in Portugal, a total of 240 cases annually. The estimated prevalence of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis after tuberculosis (TB) is 194 cases, whereas its prevalence for all underlying pulmonary conditions was 776 patients.

The aim of this investigation was to understand whether the structural modifications that arise when a patient’s nail become infected plates influences the permeation of drugs into the nail following topical application. It was hoped that through improving understanding of the nail barrier in the diseased state, the development of more effective topical treatments for onychomycosis could be facilitated. The permeation of three compounds with differing hydrophobicities, caffeine, terbinafine and amorolfine (clogD at pH 7. 4 of − 0. 55, 3. 72 and 4. 49 respectively), was assessed across both healthy and onychomycosis infected, full thickness, human nail plate sections. Transonychial water loss (TOWL) measurements performed on the healthy and diseased nails supported previous observations that the nail behaves like a porous barrier given the lack of correlation between TOWL values with the thicker, diseased nails. The flux of the more hydrophilic caffeine was twofold greater across diseased in comparison with the healthy nails, whilst the hydrophobic molecules terbinafine and amorolfine showed no statistically significant change in their nail penetration rates. Caffeine flux across the nail was found to correlate with the TOWL measurements, though no correlation existed for the more hydrophobic drugs.

The {{goal of this}} study was to investigate the frequency of onychomycosis and its associated factors in patients referred to Boali Sina Hospital and Toba dermatology outpatient clinics, Sari. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study, nail specimens were collected from 101 patients suspected of onychomycosis during a 14 month period. Nail specimens were examined by direct microscopy, using potassium hydroxide (KOH) 20 %, KOH + CFW, KONCPA (KOH treated nail clipping+PAS) and also culturing on sabouraud’s dextrose agar, containing chloramphenicol (SC), and sabouraud’s dextrose agar containing cyclohexamide and chloramphenicol (SCC) mediums. Results: In this study, 79 (78 %) of patients were female and 22 (22 %) were male. Yeasts were isolated in 30 % cases of onychomycosis, mainly from fingernails. Candida albicans, and C. krusei was the most prevalent species. Non-dermatophytic filamentous fungi were yielded at 24 %, especially from toenails, with Aspergillus terreus being the most prevalent species. Dermatophytes were found in 7 % of the samples, especially from toenails. Trichophyton mentagrophytes was the predominant species. Unknown filamentous fungi were identified in 19 % of samples, while mixed infections were identified in 20 % of samples. The highest prevalence rate of onychomycosis was identified in the patients within the 30 to 49 years of age group. Distal and lateral subfungual onychomycosis (DLSO) was the most prevalent clinical types with (88 %), followed by WSO (5 %), PSO (5 %), TDO (1 %) and DLSO + PSO (1 %).

In my thesis I describe individual types of mycotic diseases {{with regard to their}} epidemiological characteristics, techniques and options of treatment. I also give information on preventive measures to help prevent transmission of the infection. The first objective of the thesis was to identify the most often diagnosed mycoses in the dermatologist´s consulting room during one year. This objective was achieved by using medical history records and it was found out that the most frequent diseases are especially <b>fungal</b> <b>nail</b> <b>infection,</b> <b>fungal</b> foot <b>infection</b> and superficial mycosis - Pityriasis versicolor. The second objective was to evaluate psychological and social impact in patients with mycotic diseases in comparison with respondents from general public. This objective was achieved as well. Using questionnaires, 60 respondents were asked 34 questions. The questions were prepared {{in such a way that}} information both from the dermatologist´s consulting room patients and from respondents from general public could have been obtained by the inquiry. The outcome of the whole inquiry was supposed to be evaluation of two hypotheses. The first one should have confirmed or rejected the idea that patients with mycotic disease in medical history have more information on this issue, better awareness about options of transmission prevention, prevention of re-infection and they behave more responsibly regarding prevention of mycoses transmission in population than the others. The second hypothesis stated that mycotic diseases have negative social and psychological impact. In the conclusion both hypotheses were basically confirmed. Awareness of respondents from general public is not on a high level, on the contrary, large majority admitted lack of awareness about this issue. Negative impact in people suffering from this disease is very perceptible. Most respondents perceive the disease as a social handicap and they try to hide the possible visible symptoms on their body at any cost. Adverse reactions to them from their family and relatives or from the public are no exception. In my opinion, the further procedures to improve the existing situation should be adhering to preventive measures such as maintaining personal hygiene or disinfection of risky areas.

The development of polyurethane based nail lacquers for the delivery drugs to treat onychomycosis is still a challenge. Nowadays there are drugs with pharmacological activity (antifungal) for treatment of onychomycosis (i. e. terbinafine hydrochloride), but there is no nail lacquer formulation in the market capable of delivering them into the nail with success. Polyurethanes are being used for sustained and controlled delivery of various drugs. The development of a new polyurethane based on carbohydrates for the delivery of antifungal (terbinafine hydrochloride and ciclopirox olamine) to treat onychomycosis, is the main aim of this thesis. The thesis is divided in two main topics: The first part presents the synthesis of polyurethanes from carbohydrates and derivatives. The biocompatible polyurethanes were successfully synthesized employing carbohydrates and aliphatic isocyanates. The polyurethanes were synthesized by pre polymerization method. This process allows maintain better control the structure and properties of the final polymer, through a simple change of chain extender. It was possible to obtain polyurethanes with different properties from the same pre-polymer, that are typically liquids, which facilitates handling on an industrial scale, when compared with monomeric isocyanate systems. The polyurethanes were characterized by FTIR, NMR, GPC and MALDI-TOF. The biocompatibility of these materials was also assessed using keratinocytes cell. In the second part of our work, four polymers were used to prepare nail lacquers containing terbinafine hydrochloride as a model drug. The results obtained from the structural/characterization analysis of these PU based nail lacquers, comprising all the data and information that allowed the selection of the best of them to optimize the final formulations. At this stage, only one of the tested PU was selected to the complete physical, chemical and microbiological studies with two drug models: terbinafine hydrochloride and ciclopirox olamine. PU based nail lacquers with different amounts of the polyurethane selected previous were prepared. Cytotoxicity, wettability, SEM, adhesion test, viscosity, in vitro release and permeation studies as well as the antifungal activity were performed...|$|R

Mycotic cultures were taken and fungus types were detected. The laser protocol included two sessions with a one-month interval. Treatment duration was approximately 15 minutes per session and patients were observed over a 3 -month time period. Laser fluencies of 14 [*]J/cm 2 were applied at 9 billionths {{of a second}} pulse duration and at 5 [*]Hz frequency. Follow-up was performed at 3 months with mycological cultures. Before and after digital photographs were taken. Adverse effects were recorded and all participants completed “self-evaluation questionnaires” rating their level of satisfaction.

40|$|Background: Onychomycosis {{accounts}} for {{approximately half of}} all nail disorders and is usually asymptomatic. Objectives: To evaluate patients′ recognition of <b>fungal</b> <b>nail</b> disease, concomitant <b>fungal</b> skin diseases, complications, and quality of life. Methods: Patients from the <b>fungal</b> <b>nail</b> clinic were enrolled between May 2011 and April 2012. Patients′ awareness of diseased nails was evaluated and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire {{was used to evaluate}} the impact of dermatologic disease on quality of life. Results: A total of 110 patients with onychomycosis were enrolled in the study, of which 64 (58. 2 %) were female and the mean age was  60. 8 years. The number of patients who were able to recognize the presence of onychomycosis was 71 (64. 5 %), while 32 (29. 1 %) and 7 (6. 4 %) were diagnosed by a dermatologist and other physicians, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that patient recognition of the disease was significantly associated with female sex and young age. The mean DLQI score was  3. 6. Limitation:   Patient recall bias including the duration of <b>fungal</b> <b>nail</b> <b>infection,</b> long-term past history and previous treatment was a limitation of this study that affected DLQI scores. Conclusion: About half of onychomycosis patients, especially elderly males, could not recognize the disease by themselves. It is important for physicians to educate patients with risk factors for onychomycosis to recognize this condition early to prevent concomitant infection and complications, and to improve patients′ well-being...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>fungal</b> <b>nail</b> <b>infections</b> is increasing {{and this is}} possibly because of several factors: better methods of detection, a growing population of immunocompromised patients who have a greater susceptibility to such infections, {{the increased use of}} immunosuppressive drugs, the increasing number of elderly people, worldwide travel, and the use of communal bathing facilities. Onychomycosis is a <b>fungal</b> <b>infection</b> of the fingernails and toenails that accounts for about 30 % of all superficial <b>fungal</b> <b>infections.</b> It is characterised by nail discoloration, thickening and ultimately destruction of the nail plate. Management of this disease has improved significantly and treatment patterns have dramatically changed in recent years as a result of advances in new treatment options (e. g. oral antifungal agents) and changes in treatment regimens (e. g. pulse therapy). Also, newer drugs for onychomycosis have improved tolerability profiles compared with older agents. The overall costs of treating onychomycosis are substantial, and {{it has been estimated that}} direct cost for US Medicare patients with the disease is $US 43 million per year (year of costing not available). Pharmacoeconomic studies help in the decision-making process when selecting the most cost-effective antifungal agents to treat onychomycosis. To date there have been a number of national and international economic studies aimed at effectively assessing the efficacy and costs of the treatment options available to cure onychomycosis. The objectives of this paper are to 1. review the published findings regarding the epidemiology of onychomycosis; 2. summarise the original pharmacoeconomic studies that describe the economic impact of the disease; and 3. address the impact of the disease on patients' health-related quality of life.

40|$|Onychomycosis is {{a chronic}} disease caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and molds, {{which leads to}} {{destruction}} of the nail plate of the fingernails and toenails. The incidence of onychomycosis in children is considerably smaller compared with that in adults. Onychomycosis in children under 6 years of age is particularly unusual. The trauma and the hyperhidrosis after puberty are the major predisposing factor for <b>fungal</b> <b>nail</b> <b>infection</b> in childhood. Some systemic diseases and congenital syndromes have a crucial role {{for the development of}} onychomycosis in children. Wearing infected socks and shoes of other family members, family history for <b>fungal</b> <b>infection</b> of the <b>nails,</b> reduced hygiene and onychophagia are other important predisposing factors. Dermatophytic species Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton flocosum are the most frequent causative agents of onychomycosis in adults and much less common yeast of the genus Candida. A retrospective study for a period of 11 years was performed (2003 - 2013) investigating 292 children aged 0 to 18 years with proven onychomycosis (123 - from Plovdiv, Bulgaria, 94 - from Pleven, Bulgaria, and 75 - from Thessaloniki, Greece). Candida albicans was the main etiologic agent in onychomycosis in children under 18 years of age, according to the performed retrospective study. The diagnose was made by direct microscopic examination and fungal culture on Sabouraud agar media...|$|R
40|$|Onychomycosis is a <b>fungal</b> <b>nail</b> <b>infection</b> {{that takes}} a sig-nificant toll {{on the quality of}} life of patients. It affectsfrom 2 % to 13 % of adults and children. 1 - 3 Although the {{prevalence}} of onychomycosis in the managed care setting is not known, the advent of dynamic new oral therapies has brought new attention to onychomycosis. The treatment options for ony-chomycosis vary widely, as do the costs incurred with these dif-ferent treatments. Since there is no standardized treatment algo-rithm for this medical problem, room exists for improved man-agement. When choosing among medications for onychomycosis, the potential for drug interactions in patients using other medications is an important and well-recognized issue. Drug interactions and other adverse events can lead to considerable health problems and/or inconvenience to patients and drastically increase the cost of medical treatment. 4, 5 These interactions can result in treatment failures if the bioavailability of antifungal therapy is altered 6 or i...|$|R
