30|$|In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} the percentage composition of vanadium oxide nanoparticles to be supported on the nickel-manganese-mixed oxide for the best catalytic performance as an oxidation catalyst, a series of catalysts with varying percentages of vanadium oxide nanoparticles were synthesized and evaluated for their catalytic property, monitoring the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde as a model reaction. The reaction was carried out at 100 °C, while passing molecular O 2 gas {{as a source of}} oxygen. During the study, a trend of steady increase in performance of the synthesized catalyst was observed with the increase in the composition percentage of vanadium oxide, which explains the influence of vanadium oxide nanoparticles on the catalytic performance. The catalyst with 1 % and 3 % vanadium oxide yielded 65.77 % and 74.27 % <b>conversion</b> <b>product,</b> respectively, within 75  min, while the catalyst with 5 % vanadium oxide nanoparticles yielded 100 % <b>conversion</b> <b>product</b> within the same time. In order to understand the effect of presence of vanadium oxide nanoparticles, a similar reaction was carried out {{in the presence of the}} catalyst without the vanadium oxide nanoparticles (i.e., NiMnO) which yielded a 52.56 % <b>conversion</b> <b>product.</b> This indicated that vanadium oxide acts as a promoter for the selective catalytic oxidation.|$|R

During electrophoresis C 4 in serum {{is converted to}} a product of fast β 1 mobility, usually accompanied by a slow β 2 peak. Conversion in serum is inhibited by EDTA.

50|$|The {{oxidative}} coupling {{of methane}} (OCM) {{is a type}} of chemical reaction discovered in the 1980s for the direct conversion of natural gas, primarily consisting of methane, into value-added chemicals. Direct conversion of methane into other useful products {{is one of the most}} challenging subjects to be studied in heterogeneous catalysis. Methane activation is difficult because of its thermodynamic stability with a noble gas like electronic configuration. The tetrahedral arrangement of strong C-H bonds (435 kJ/mol) offer no functional group, magnetic moments or polar distributions to undergo chemical attack. This makes methane less reactive than nearly all of its <b>conversion</b> <b>products,</b> limiting efficient utilization of natural gas, the world’s most abundant petrochemical resource.|$|E
