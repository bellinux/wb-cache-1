5|$|Kent Hughes broke Olympic {{tradition}} in two significant ways. He decided to <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> television and newsreel {{footage of the}} Games where previously footage was provided free of charge. Secondly, following a suggestion from John Ian Wing, a 17-year-old apprentice carpenter from Melbourne, Kent Hughes instigated the now familiar closing ceremony tradition of the athletes of different nations parading together, instead of with their national teams, {{as a symbol of}} world unity. Kent Hughes's plan to <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> television and newsreel footage of the Games was strongly opposed in many circles, including the media, who believed that the Games were news and as such should be free, while Australian government authorities thought that providing free television coverage of the Games would lead to greater tourism opportunities. Brundage made no public comment on television rights for the Games but grasped the financial possibilities of charging for rights, devising a television rights fees policy following the Games, whereby television stations were forced to negotiate for televised rights for all future Games. This policy is believed to have netted the IOC over $12 billion since its inception at the 1960 Summer Olympics.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the differential <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> treating {{end-stage renal disease}} (ESRD) associated with diabetes mellitus, Medicare billing data are analyzed. The charges of 244 patients in the Michigan Kidney Registry identified as having (ESRD) from diabetes are compared with charges of 902 nondiabetic patients. Average annual <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> ESRD treatment for diabetics are $ 29, 671 (+/- 27, 662) which are $ 4695 (+/- 1344) higher than <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> nondiabetics. The majority of the difference (84. 3 %) is attributable to higher inpatient hospital charges. Most of the remainder (14. 5 %) is attributable to higher physician and medical supply <b>charges.</b> <b>Charges</b> <b>for</b> treatment of diabetics are higher on all modalities of treatment, but differences are not significant among modalities...|$|R

These results establish a reference point for developing prospective payment systems for inpatient medical rehabilitation...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the variation in}} <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> 10 common blood tests across California hospitals in 2011, and to analyse the hospital and market-level factors that may explain any observed variation. Design setting and participants: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis {{of the degree of}} charge variation between hospitals for 10 common blood tests using charge data reported by all non-federal California hospitals to the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development in 2011. Outcome measures: <b>Charges</b> <b>for</b> 10 common blood tests at California hospitals during 2011. Results: We found that <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> blood tests varied significantly between California hospitals. <b>For</b> example, <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> a lipid panel ranged from US$ 10 to US$ 10   169, a thousand-fold difference. Although government hospitals and teaching hospitals were found to charge significantly less than their counterparts for many blood tests, few other hospital characteristics and no market-level predictors significantly predicted <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> blood tests. Our models explained, at most, 21 % of the variation between hospitals in <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> the blood test in question. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the seemingly arbitrary nature of the charge setting process, making it difficult for patients to act as true consumers in this era of ‘consumer-directed healthcare. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{calculator}} was {{powered by}} a Texas Instruments TMC1802NC, a metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuit with 7000 transistors. This CPU normally consumes 350 milliwatts, but by pulsing the power this requirement was reduced to 20 milliwatts. It was discovered that an early prototype continued to work if the batteries were disconnected and then reapplied quickly enough, as the capacitors in the circuit could hold a <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> up to five seconds.|$|E

This enabled WWE's pay-per-view revenue to increase by $4.7million from the previous year. When the 2005 event was released on DVD, it reached a peak position of second on Billboards DVD Sales Chart.

5|$|After the Norman Conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066AD, {{the land}} in the East Riding was granted to {{followers}} of the new Norman king and ecclesiastical institutions. When some of the northern earls rebelled, William retaliated with the Harrying of the North which laid waste many East Riding villages. The land was then distributed among powerful barons, such as the Count of Aumale in Holderness and the Percy family in the Wolds and the Vale of York. These lay lords and ecclesiastical institutions, including the monasteries, continued to improve and drain their holdings throughout the Middle Ages to maximise the rents they could <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Although casinos are {{not under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the ABC, many of the regulations for casinos and casino vendors are similar to those for ABC class C retailer licensees. Casinos may generally only purchase alcoholic beverages from licensed wholesalers (i.e. ABC Class B licensees). A casino may have a brewpub on site, but production is limited to 3,000 barrels of beer per year, and the beer may only be distributed in open containers on casino floor and in hotel areas of the casino. Casinos may obtain a permit to have tastings, and tasting dinners. Non-profit organizations may obtain a permit to have a social event at a casino where they <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> alcoholic beverages. Organizations are limited to 12 casino social event permits per year, and a given casino may only host 25 such events per year.|$|E
5|$|Bradford took an eighth-minute lead in {{the final}} through 19-year-old Bradford-born Des Hamilton. Notts County only had one chance {{in the first half}} before {{applying}} more pressure during {{the early part of the}} second half. However Bradford's recent signing Mark Stallard doubled their lead to give them victory and newspaper reporters agreed that Bradford dominated the game. Their manager Chris Kamara had only been in <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> six months before the final. Three years after their victory, Bradford went on to win promotion to the Premier League; their opponents Notts County were relegated the season after their play-off final defeat and have yet to finish higher since their fourth-place finish in 1996.|$|E
