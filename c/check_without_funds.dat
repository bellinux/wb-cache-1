5000|$|Quevedo sought {{political}} asylum in the Venezuelan embassy in Havana {{in the summer}} of 1960 and arrived in Miami on September 7, 1960. The following month he published Bohemia Libre with $40,000 monthly from the U.S. State Department until after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961. The magazine was subsequently edited in Miami, Florida, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Caracas, Venezuela. On August 19, 1969, weeks after his publication went bankrupt and he was heavily indebted to loan sharks and had cashed large <b>checks</b> <b>without</b> <b>funds,</b> the inveterate bachelor committed suicide in the Caracas apartment that he shared with his sister Rosa Margarita Quevedo. He shot himself in the right temple with a 38 caliber revolver. Next to his body was found a letter to [...] "the competent authorities and to public opinion" [...] saying that [...] "absolutely no one should be blamed for his death." [...] He [...] "begged forgiveness from anyone he may have offended in any way." [...] Another letter was addressed to his sister, who heard the gunshot in his bedroom while she was in the kitchen.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} section, specifically {{where it}} concerns Fernand Legros, who {{is depicted as}} the villain of the piece, should be considered {{with a certain amount}} of critical skepticism as regards its bias to De Hory, as it differs intrinsically from the account given to Roger Peyrefitte by Legros himself in Peyrfitte's very complete Legros biography [...] "Tableaux de Chasse". Here De Hory appears as an aggressive and persistent con man, who suckers Legros into the belief that he is a needy impoverished aristocrat deserving of Legros charity, whereas in reality he is a person wanted by Interpol under a multitude of different aliases and convicted of a variety of crimes, forgery and fraud not being the least of them. [...] Evidently the self-serving tales that find their way into the following narrative, woven by [...] "Elmyr de Hory, Elmer Hoffman, Elementer alias Hofman, baron de Hory, Haury, Hury or Hurry, Hory, baron Raynal, Raynor, Raynol or Rainol, comte de Herzog, baron de Boughady, von Bonhyday, Boundjy, Elmyr Lazlo, Dauray, Dory, Boutin, Dory-Boutin, Cassou Robert or Cassou Charles, Louis Curiel or Curiel Charles, born in Budapest (Hungary) 14 April 1905, the date often jiggered forward to 1914 to appear younger, object of pursuits, convictions and expulsions from France, Switzerland, Italy, Federal Germany, Great Britain, from Mexico, from the United States, from Canada, for false <b>check</b> writing <b>without</b> <b>funds,</b> <b>check</b> forgery, forgery carrying a false name, theft, receiver and purveyor of stolen goods, and embezzlement" [...] should be taken with more than a large pinch of salt. The boot appears to be definitely on the other foot.|$|R
