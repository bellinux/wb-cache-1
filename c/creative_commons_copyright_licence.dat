40|$|This article {{examines}} the role of copyrights in contemporary media literacies. It argues that, provided they are ethical, young people’s engagement with text should occur in environments that are as free from restriction as possible. Discussion of open culture ecologies and the emergent education commons {{is followed by a}} theorisation of both literacy and copyrights education as forms of epistemology: that is, as effects of knowledge producing discourses and practices. Because <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> licenses respect and are based on existing copyright laws, a brief overview of traditional copyrights for educators is first provided. We then describe the voluntary <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>copyright</b> licensing framework (“some rights reserved”) as an alternative to conventional “all rights reserved” models. This is followed by an account of a series of workshop activities on <b>copyrights</b> and <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> conducted by the authors in the media literacy classes of a preservice teacher education program in Queensland, Australia.

In particular, the possibility of Cultural Knowledge Management Systems {{and the use of}} innovative <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>copyright</b> licenses are explored. It is argued that in a global knowledge economy, cultural production is a major driver of economic growth. The creativity and culture needed for cultural production are plentiful in developing countries indicating that if technical and institutional conditions are right there is significant potential for developing economies to compete in the global economy. It is, therefore, desirable for local groups to be able to acquire, store, and distribute locally and internationally sourced content to stimulate local-level cultural production. © 2007, Idea Group Inc...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{regulation}} of copyright {{has recently been}} criticized from two opposing angles: While copyright holders and industries bemoan insufficient protection of copyrighted material in the digital era of lossless copying and file-sharing, a diverse coalition of dissident copyright lawyers, artists and activists claims that the prevalent copyright regime hinders new forms of content creation and distribution. In this paper, we compare the resource mobilization of industry-led Digital Rights Management (DRM) initiatives and the <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>copyright</b> licenses project. While the former was, despite the resourcefulness of the actors, fraught with collective action problems, the latter was, despite an originally weak resource position, able to mobilize support from {{a broad range of}} civil society groups and users. We conclude that there is something inherently political in the governance of new digital markets which provides opportunities for civil society actors to counterbalance the influence of large companies...|$|R

30|$|The {{control group}} {{consisted}} of three professional human experts and one nonexpert, who had never panned music before. The test material consisted of 12 multitrack songs of different styles of music. Stereo sources {{were used in the}} form of two separate monotracks. Where acoustic drums were used, they would be recorded with multiple microphones and then premixed down into a stereo mix. Humans and algorithms used the same stereo drum and keyboard tracks as separate left and right monofiles. All 12 songs were panned by the expert human mixers and by the nonexpert human mixer. They were asked to pan the song while listening for the first time. They had the length of the song to determine their definitive panning positions. The same songs were passed through algorithms A and B only once for {{the entire length of the}} song. Although the goal was to give the human and machine mixers as close to the same information as possible, human mixers had the advantage of knowing which type of instrument it was. Therefore, they assigned priority according to this prior known knowledge. For this reason a similar priority scheme was chosen to compensate for this. Both A and B algorithms used the same priority schema. Mixes used during the test contain music freely available under <b>creative</b> <b>commons</b> <b>copyright</b> can be located in [19].|$|R
40|$|Since 1996, Mountain Legacy Project (MLP) {{researchers}} have been exploring change in Canada's mountain environments {{through the use of}} systematic repeat photography. With access to upwards of 120, 000 systematic glass plate negatives from Canada's mountain west, the MLP field teams seek to stand where historic surveyors stood and accurately reshoot these images. The resulting image pairs are analyzed, catalogued, and made available for further research into landscape changes. In this article we suggest that repeat photography would fit well within the Future Earth research agenda. We go on to introduce the Image Analysis Toolkit (IAT), which provides interactive comparative image visualization and analytics {{for a wide variety of}} ecological, geological, fluvial, and human phenomena. The toolkit is based on insights from recent research on repeat photography and features the following: user-controlled ability to compare, overlay, classify, scale, fade, draw, and annotate images; production of comparative statistics on user-defined categories (eg percentage of ice cover change in each image pair); and different ways to visualize change in the image pairs. The examples presented here utilize MLP image pairs, but the toolkit is designed to be used by anyone with their own comparative images as well as those in the MLP collection. All images and software are under <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>copyright</b> and are open access for noncommercial use via the Mountain Legacy Explorer website.

40|$|What {{makes an}} {{educational}} resource "open"? Is it enough that resources {{are available on}} the World Wide Web free of charge, or does openness require something more?" These questions have become more urgent as the open education movement has gained momentum and as potential users of open educational resources (OERs) increasingly face uncertainty about whether permission is required when they translate, reuse, adapt, or simply republish the resources they find. With the support of The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, ccLearn surveyed the copyright licensing policies of several hundred educational projects or organizations on the Internet to assess whether these legal conditions limit the usefulness of self-designated open resources from the user's perspective. The study reveals three principal findings: The copyright licenses or terms of use associated with some OERs are difficult to find or to understand; The majority of OER projects or organizations have adopted a standardized license created by an independent license provider, and of these, the large majority have adopted {{one or more of the}} six <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>copyright</b> licenses ("CC licenses") to define the terms of openness. But, a sizable minority of OER providers have chosen to craft their own license [...] often borrowing terms from one of the standardized licenses. Thus, as a group, OER providers have adopted a diverse, and often customized, set of license conditions that in some cases require significant work by users to understand; The usefulness of OERs as a group is limited by incompatible license conditions that functionally prohibit combination or adaptation of OERs provided by different sources. This report concludes with a recommendation that creators of open educational resources consider using CC licenses to provide users with readily found, standardized terms of use. It recommends further that OER creators consider adopting the most open of CC licenses, the Attribution-only License (CC BY), to nourish the creativity of educators and learners alike by allowing the adaptation, combination, and republication of OERs from multiple sources...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the concept of {{curation}} as a student- and creation-driven pedagogical tool to enhance digital and media literacy education. Specifically, it will unpack the phenomenon of curation as a pedagogical model for enhancing civic engagement, community, and purpose within social media platforms. Online curation—an increasingly common way to refer to the act of organizing various content into cohesive online stories—has taken numerous forms in recent years. Media organizations are increasingly integrating such tools into their web presence, most recently seen by the New York Times, NPR and the Washington Post utilizing Storify curation software for multimedia stories; and Al Jazeera, CNN and others integrating Twitter into their regular online programming. Curation is also being explored through remix—the sharing, repurposing, or re-appropriating of content online—as a function of <b>creative</b> <b>commons</b> and <b>copyright,</b> and in terms of cultural production and social structure. This chapter will build a framework for curation as it builds on existing models for digital and media education and remix culture. It will develop curation as a foundational media education competence to teach students about responsibility, purpose, and participation in social media spaces...|$|R

40|$|Open Access {{funded by}} Economic and Social Research Council under a <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> license. <b>Copyright</b> © 2014 Published by Elsevier B. V. In most {{equilibrium}} sorting models (ESMs) of residential choice across neighborhoods, {{the question of}} whether households rent or buy their home is either ignored or else tenure status is treated as exogenous. Of course, tenure status is not exogenous and households' tenure choices may have important public policy implications, particularly since higher levels of homeownership have been shown to correlate strongly with various indicators of improved neighborhood quality. Indeed, numerous policies including that of mortgage interest deduction (MID) have been implemented with the express purpose of promoting homeownership. This paper presents an ESM with simultaneous rental and purchase markets in which tenure choice is endogenized and neighborhood quality is partly determined by neighborhood composition. The public policy relevance of the model is shown through a calibration exercise for Boston, Massachusetts, which explores the impacts of various reforms to the MID policy. The simulations confirm some of the arguments made about reforming MID but also demonstrate how the complex patterns of behavioral change induced by policy reform can lead to unanticipated effects. The results suggest that {{it may be possible to}} reform MID while maintaining the prevailing rates of homeownership and reducing the federal budget deficit.

40|$|<b>Copyright</b> <b>licences</b> can be implied {{when the}} doing of a {{restricted}} act is covered neither by the express <b>licence</b> of the <b>copyright</b> owner, nor {{by one of}} the statutory limitations and exceptions. The manner in which <b>copyright</b> <b>licences</b> are implied, therefore, holds the key to broadening the scope of permissible acts. In contrast to the rigidity of statutory limitations and exceptions, implied licences are more malleable in being able to respond to a diverse set of circumstances, as the need arises. Thus, implied licences can serve as a flexible and targeted mechanism to balance competing interests, including those of copyright owners and content users, especially in todayâs dynamic technological environment. However, implication as a process is contentious, and there are no established rules for implying a licence. Implication of a <b>copyright</b> <b>licence</b> is even more complicated because the conceptualisation of a <b>copyright</b> <b>licence</b> is unsatisfactory. The resulting uncertainty has prevented implied licences from being embraced more readily by the courts. The objective of this thesis is, therefore, firstly, to reconceptualise a <b>copyright</b> <b>licence</b> that is broad enough to accommodate the diverse circumstances in which <b>copyright</b> <b>licences</b> arise, and certain enough to assist in finding their constituents; secondly, to propose frameworks for implying <b>copyright</b> <b>licences</b> in a methodical and transparent manner, based on three sources: the consent of the copyright owner; an established custom; and state intervention to achieve public policy goals. The frameworks are also customised differently for implied bare and implied contractual licences. The thesis demonstrates the robustness of these frameworks by rationalising them with the existing case law. Underscoring the contemporary relevance of implied licences, in conclusion, the thesis tests and validates the frameworks in relation to three essential and ubiquitous functions on the internet â browsing, hyperlinking and indexing...|$|R
