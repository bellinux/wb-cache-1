For the rest of the war, Bennions was a senior fighter controller at various units in the North of England.|$|R
50|$|The first {{squadron}} {{to arrive}} was 247 Squadron with Hawker Hurricanes, specialising in night defence of the South West's towns and ports. The night fighting element was later augmented by 1457 Flight flying Douglas Havocs with its unsuccessful Turbinlite searchlight tactics. However, {{the arrival of}} 600 Squadron with radar equipped Bristol Beaufighters produced better results.

For the latter, {{for the first time}} in its history, in order to meet any threats posed by slow speed aircraft, North Bay's NORAD controllers trained to carry out Ground <b>Controlled</b> <b>Interceptions</b> of helicopters.|$|R
50|$|Despite its {{powerful}} radar, the Su-15, like most Soviet interceptors before the late 1980s, was {{heavily dependent on}} ground <b>control</b> <b>interception</b> (GCI), with aircraft vectored onto targets by ground radar stations. It was fitted with the Lazur-S datalink system, which transmitted instructions to the pilot to accomplish the interception. The later Su-15TM had a Vozdukh-1M datalink and SAU-58 (sistema automaticheskogo upravleniya, automatic control system) capable of carrying out completely automatic, 'hands-off' interceptions until the last moments of the interception.|$|R
2500|$|The F-106 was envisaged as a {{specialized}} all-weather missile-armed interceptor {{to shoot down}} bombers.

The MA-1 proved extremely troublesome and was eventually upgraded more than 60 times in service.|$|R
50|$|The site {{started out}} as an {{experimental}} Ground <b>Controlled</b> <b>Interception</b> (GCI) radar station. Using systems developed in nearby Christchurch, a variety of lash-up systems were installed during 1940 and 1941. These were eventually put into production as the AMES Type 7, which took over most aircraft direction and interception duties from about 1942 on. Sopley received its own Type 7 in 1943. It was a permanent fixture with rotating ariel array, transmitter equipment stored in an underground bunker, operations block, emergency back up power supply and guard hut.|$|E
50|$|The wing was {{organized}} in 1960 and assigned a fighter interceptor squadron and a squadron operating a radar for ground <b>controlled</b> <b>interception.</b> The 4683d also acted {{as the host}} organization at Thule until October, when support units were transferred to the 4683d Air Base Group, which {{was attached to the}} wing, but assigned to the 64th Air Division in Newfoundland. It supported the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System when the system was activated at Thule, but was discontinued when that mission supplanted the wing's traditional air defense mission.|$|E
50|$|The {{invention}} of radar made possible early, long-range detection of aircraft at long range, {{on the order}} of , both day and night and in all weathers. A typical bomber might take twenty minutes to cross the detection zone of early radar systems, time enough for interceptor fighters to start up, climb to altitude and engage the bombers. Ground <b>controlled</b> <b>interception</b> required constant contact between the interceptor and the ground until the bombers became visible to the pilots and nationwide networks like the Dowding system were built in the late 1930s.|$|E
50|$|San Clemente Island Air Force Station was Permanent System {{radar station}} LP-39 which began {{operations}} in November 1951 with an AN/TPS-1C general surveillance radar. Designated {{as one of}} two offshore radar stations at the Southern California coast, the 670th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated at the station on 1 February 1952 by the 27th Air Division. As an AC&W radar station, the facility provided radar tracks for a Manual Air Defense Control Center to direct Ground <b>control</b> <b>interception</b> (GCI) of unidentified aircraft.|$|R

50|$|Whirlwind {{construction}} {{started in}} 1948, {{an effort that}} employed 175 people including 70 engineers and technicians. Whirlwind took three years to build and first went online on April 20, 1951. The project's budget was approximately $1 million a year, which was vastly higher than the development costs of most other computers of the era. After three years the Navy had lost interest. However, during this time the Air Force had become interested in using computers to help the task of ground <b>controlled</b> <b>interception,</b> and the Whirlwind was the only machine suitable to the task. They took up development under Project Claude.|$|E
5000|$|The second Ground Observer Corps, with {{programmatic}} {{aims and}} methodologies {{similar to the}} first, was organized in early 1950, during the Cold War. Operating as {{an arm of the}} United States Air Force Civil Defense service, the second GOC supplemented the Lashup Radar Network and the Permanent System radar stations. Observations were telephoned directly to filter centers and the information was in turn relayed to Air Defense Command ground <b>control</b> <b>interception</b> centers. By 1952 the GOC program was expanded into Operation Skywatch, consisting of 750,000 volunteers working in shifts at over 16,000 posts and 73 filter centers. An extant example of an observation platform used by GOC/Skywatch volunteers is the Cairo Skywatch Tower.|$|R

5000|$|In 1942 the Luftwaffe {{began the}} {{so-called}} [...] "Baedeker Blitz", {{in retaliation for}} RAF Bomber Command attacks on German cities. The Luftwaffe bombed Ipswich, Poole and Canterbury {{on the night of}} the 2/3 June 1942. Near Canterbury Burbridge claimed his first successes—a probable Junkers Ju 88 over Ipswich—at 03:30 on 2 June 1942. The following night, at 02:50, he damaged a Dornier Do 217 over Canterbury. Burbridge was guided to his targets by ground <b>control</b> <b>interception</b> which placed him within in a mile of the target aircraft. The radio operator guided him with the onboard AI Mk. VIII radar set until the enemy was in visual range. For his service he was promoted to Flying Officer on 1 July 1942.|$|R
5000|$|Near to the village, {{bordering}} Ripley was the Ground <b>Controlled</b> <b>Interception</b> (GCI) radar station. Its {{purpose to}} detect, locate and track enemy aircraft and provide inland radar coverage for Britain. Initially a mobile station, by 1943 {{it was a}} permanent fixture with rotating ariel array, transmitter equipment stored in an underground bunker, operations block, emergency back up power supply and guard hut. In 1946 RAF Sopley was re-classified as a master GCI station and reserve Sector Operations Centre. As part of the UK's programme to update its air defences, Sopley underwent much modernisation during the 1950s including a new guardhouse providing access to a two-storey underground operations centre.|$|E

The boom had broken lots of windows. But {{the thing that really}} annoyed him was that the sonic boom sounded just like the signal to launch the lifeboat - which was now {{in the middle of the}} North Sea. The Mayor was not too impressed with all this. I did the hot-foot dance routine that most young lads go through when the've been nicked. It was about half a day later that the Ground <b>Controlled</b> <b>Interception</b> controller let me off the hook. He 'phoned to tell me that he had been responsible and that it wasn't the Mayor of Bridlington after all!" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of jet power increased speeds from perhaps 400 mph to 600 mph in a step and roughly doubled operational altitudes. Although radars also improved in performance, {{the gap between}} offense and defense was dramatically reduced. Large attacks could so confuse the defense's {{ability to communicate with}} pilots that the classic method of manual ground <b>controlled</b> <b>interception</b> was increasingly seen as inadequate. In the United States, this led to the {{introduction of}} the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment to computerize this task. The introduction of the first useful surface-to-air missiles in the 1950s obviated the need for fast reaction time interceptors as the missile could launch almost instantly and air forces increasingly turned to much larger designs, with enough fuel for longer endurance, to avoid the need for rapid reaction.|$|E
50|$|In {{this role}} the 39th trained the {{assigned}} units and <b>controlled</b> aerial <b>interception</b> missions when Japanese air space was violated.

50|$|By late 1939 it was {{realized}} that {{the rotation of the}} beam on the radar display could be accomplished using electronics. In December 1939, G.W.A Dummer began development of such a system, and in June 1940 a modified CHL radar was motorized to continually spin in bearing, and connected to one of these new displays. The result was a 360 degree view of the airspace around the radar. Six copies of the prototype Ground <b>Control</b> <b>Interception</b> radars (GCI) were hand-built at AMES (Air Ministry Experimental Station) and RAE during November and December 1940, and the first went operational at RAF Sopley on New Year's Day 1941, with the rest following {{by the end of the}} month. Prior to their introduction in December 1940 the interception rate was 0.5%; by May 1941, with a number of operational GCI stations and better familiarity, it was 7%, with a kill rate of around 2.5%.|$|R
