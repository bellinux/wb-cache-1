40|$|Proposed {{modifications}} of an offset-quadri-phase-shift keying (offset-QPSK) {{transmitter and receiver}} would {{reduce the amount of}} signal processing that must be done in the receiver to resolve the QPSK fourfold phase ambiguity. Resolution of the phase ambiguity is necessary in order to synchronize, with the received carrier signal, the signal generated by a local oscillator in a <b>carrier-tracking</b> <b>loop</b> in the receiver. Without resolution of the fourfold phase ambiguity, the loop could lock to any of four possible phase points, only one of which has the proper phase relationship with the carrier. The proposal applies, more specifically, to an offset-QPSK receiver that contains a <b>carrier-tracking</b> <b>loop</b> like that shown in Figure 1. This <b>carrier-tracking</b> <b>loop</b> does not resolve or reduce the phase ambiguity. A <b>carrier-tracking</b> <b>loop</b> of a different design optimized for the reception of offset QPSK could reduce the phase ambiguity from fourfold to twofold, but would be more complex. Alternatively, one could resolve the fourfold phase ambiguity by use of differential coding in the transmitter, at a cost of reduced power efficiency. The proposed modifications would make it possible to reduce the fourfold phase ambiguity to twofold, with no loss in power efficiency and only relatively simple additional signal-processing steps in the transmitter and receiver. The twofold phase ambiguity would then be resolved by use of a unique synchronization word, as is commonly done in binary phase-shift keying (BPSK). Although the mathematical and signal-processing principles underlying the modifications are too complex to explain in detail here, the modifications themselves would be relatively simple and are best described with the help of simple block diagrams (see Figure 2). In the transmitter, one would add a unit that would periodically invert bits going into the QPSK modulator; in the receiver, one would add a unit that would effect different but corresponding inversions of bits coming out of the QPSK demodulator. The net effect of all the inversions would be that depending on which lock point the <b>carrier-tracking</b> <b>loop</b> had selected, all the output bits would be either inverted or non-inverted together; hence, the ambiguity would be reduced from fourfold to twofold, as desired...|$|E

40|$|A viable, efficient, {{and easily}} {{mechanized}} carrier regenerating receiver {{for use in}} suppressed carrier-tracking system is described. The receiver {{referred to as a}} data-aided receiver (DAR) incorporates a data-aided loop (DAL) which provides the required carrier reference signal. The DAL employs the principle of decision feedback and as such is more efficient than other forms of suppressed <b>carrier-tracking</b> <b>loops.</b> The analysis, design, and implementation of the DAR are covered in detail.

The impact of the interference on both the <b>carrier-tracking</b> <b>loop</b> (assumed to be a conventional Costas loop) and the data detection are considered both individually and in combination. It is shown that, for loop parameters of prac-tical interest, the dominant efiect is the degradation induced on the data-detection process, which, depending on the relative frequency ofiset between the interferer and the desired signal as well as their relative power ratio, can be quite signiflcant.

40|$|In {{order to}} enhance the {{acquisition}} performance of global positioning system (GPS) receivers in weak signal conditions, a high-sensitivity acquisition scheme aided by strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) information is proposed. The carrier Doppler shift and Doppler rate are pre-estimated with SINS aiding and GPS ephemeris, so that the frequency search space is reduced, and the dynamic effect on the acquisition sensitivity is mitigated effectively. Meanwhile, to eliminate the signal-to-noise ratio gain attenuation caused by data bit transitions, an optimal estimation of the unknown data bits is implemented with the Viterbi algorithm. A differential correction method is then utilized to improve the acquisition accuracy of Doppler shift and therefore to meet the requirement of <b>carrier-tracking</b> <b>loop</b> initialization. Finally, the reacquisition experiments of weak GPS signals are implemented in short signal blockage situations. The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed scheme can significantly improve the acquisition accuracy and sensitivity and shorten the reacquisition time. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|With the {{modernization}} of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), secondary codes, {{also known as the}} Neumann–Hoffman (NH) codes, are modulated on the satellite signal to obtain a better positioning performance. However, this leads to an attenuation of the acquisition sensitivity of classic integration algorithms because of the frequent bit transitions that refer to the NH codes. Taking weak BeiDou navigation satellite system (BDS) signals as objects, the present study analyzes the side effect of NH codes on acquisition in detail and derives a straightforward formula, which indicates that bit transitions decrease the frequency accuracy. To meet the requirement of <b>carrier-tracking</b> <b>loop</b> initialization, a frequency recalculation algorithm is proposed based on verified fast Fourier transform (FFT) to mitigate the effect, meanwhile, the starting point of NH codes is found. Then, a differential correction is utilized to improve the acquisition accuracy of code phase. Monte Carlo simulations and real BDS data tests demonstrate that the new structure is superior to the conventional algorithms both in detection probability and frequency accuracy in a degraded channel...|$|E

The ability of the GPS receiver to operate in noisy and dynamic environments is dependent primarily {{on the ability of}} these two loops to overcome corruption of the input signal due to noise and modulation due to movement. Expanding the operating environment of these loops, therefore, can significantly improve GPS receiver operation.

40|$|A {{semaphore}} scheme {{has been}} devised {{to satisfy a}} requirement to enable ultrahigh- frequency (UHF) radio communication between a spacecraft descending from orbit to a landing on Mars and a spacecraft, in orbit about Mars, that relays communications between Earth and the lander spacecraft. There are also two subsidiary requirements: (1) to use UHF transceivers, built and qualified for operation aboard the spacecraft that operate with residual-carrier binary phase-shift-keying (BPSK) modulation at a selectable data rate of 8, 32, 128, or 256 kb/s; and (2) to enable low-rate signaling even when received signals become so weak as to prevent communication at the minimum BPSK rate of 8 kHz. The scheme involves exploitation of Manchester encoding, which is {{used in conjunction with}} residual-carrier modulation to aid the <b>carrier-tracking</b> <b>loop.</b> By choosing various sequences of 1 s, 0 s, or 1 s alternating with 0 s to be fed to the residual-carrier modulator, one would cause the modulator to generate sidebands at a fundamental frequency of 4 or 8 kHz and harmonics thereof. These sidebands would constitute the desired semaphores. In reception, the semaphores would be detected by a software demodulator...|$|E
