5|$|The target chamber is a two-wall {{structure}} {{filled with}} liquid lithium or a lithium alloy between the walls. The lithium captures neutrons from the reactions to breed tritium, and also {{acts as the}} primary coolant loop. The chamber is filled with xenon gas that would slow the ions from the reaction as well as protect the inner wall, or first wall, from the massive x-ray flux. Because the chamber is not highly pressurized, like a fission core, {{it does not have}} to be built as a single sphere. Instead, the LIFE chamber is built from eight identical sections that include built-in connections to the <b>cooling</b> <b>loop.</b> They are shipped to the plant and bolted together on two supports, and then surrounded by a tube-based space frame.|$|E

40|$|Observations of the post-flare loops {{after the}} X 3. 9 flare which {{occurred}} on 25 June, 1992 at 20 : 11 UT by the Yohkoh/SXT in X-rays, {{as well as}} in Hα obtained at 5 different observatories, have provided a unique, longest ever, set of data for a study {{of the relationship between the}} hot and <b>cool</b> post-flare <b>loops</b> as they evolve. At any given time, the altitude difference between the hot X-ray loops of 6 - 7 × 10 6 K and the <b>cool</b> Hα <b>loops</b> of 1. 5 × 10 4 K is related to the expansion rate of the loop systems and their cooling time. Therefore, measurements of the expansion rate and relative height of hot and <b>cool</b> <b>loops</b> can provide direct observational values for their cooling times. We measured the altitude of hot and <b>cool</b> <b>loops</b> for 15 and 19 hours, respectively, and found that the cooling time increased as the density of the loops decreased. We found a reasonably good agreement between the observed cooling times and those obtained from model calculations, although the observed values were always somewhat longer than the theoretical ones. Taking into account evolutionary effects, we also found similar shapes and configurations of hot and <b>cool</b> <b>loops</b> during the entire observing period and confirmed that, at any time, hot loops are at higher altitude than <b>cool</b> <b>loops,</b> suggesting that <b>cool</b> <b>loops</b> indeed evolve from hot loops. These results were used to check the validity of the reconnection model...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cool</b> <b>loops</b> {{can be seen}} at {{the border}} of the solar disk. They are {{different}} from prominences because they look as concentric arches with maximum temperature of the order 0,1 MK (too low to be considered coronal features). These <b>cool</b> <b>loops</b> show an intense variability: they appear and disappear in some UV lines in a time less than an hour, or they rapidly expand in 10-20 minutes. Foukal [...] studied these <b>cool</b> <b>loops</b> in detail from the observations taken with the EUV spectrometer on Skylab in 1976. Otherwise, when the plasma temperature of these loops becomes coronal (above 1 MK), these features appear more stable and evolve on longer times.|$|R
25|$|The main change, and {{the most}} radical among the CANDU generations, {{is the use of}} {{pressurized}} light water as the coolant. This significantly reduces the cost of implementing the primary <b>cooling</b> <b>loop,</b> which no longer has to be filled with expensive heavy water. The ACR-1000 uses about 1/3rd the heavy water needed in earlier generation designs. It also eliminates tritium production in the coolant loop, the major source of tritium leaks in operational CANDU designs. The redesign also allows for a slightly negative void reactivity, a major design goal of all Gen III+ machines.|$|E
25|$|Molten salts can {{be highly}} {{corrosive}} and corrosivity increases with temperature. For the primary <b>cooling</b> <b>loop,</b> a material is needed that can withstand corrosion at high temperatures and intense radiation. Experiments show that Hastelloy-N and similar alloys are suited to these tasks at operating temperatures up to about 700°C. However, operating experience is limited. Still higher operating temperatures are desirable – at 850°C thermochemical production of hydrogen becomes possible. Materials for this temperature range have not been validated, though carbon composites, molybdenum alloys (e.g. TZM), carbides, and refractory metal based or ODS alloys might be feasible.|$|E
25|$|In a {{conventional}} design with a pressurized core, refuelling the system requires the core {{to shut down}} and the pressure vessel to be opened. Due to the arrangement used in CANDU, only the single tube being refuelled needs to be depressurized. This allows the CANDU system to be continually refuelled without shutting down, another major design goal. In modern systems, two robotic machines hook up to the reactor faces and open the end caps of a pressure tube. One machine pushes in the new fuel, whereby the depleted fuel is pushed out and collected at the other end. A significant operational advantage of online refuelling is that a failed or leaking fuel bundle can {{be removed from the}} core once it has been located, thus reducing the radiation levels in the primary <b>cooling</b> <b>loop.</b>|$|E

The response of initially static <b>cool</b> <b>loops</b> to changes in the energy input is simulated. For hot loops, it is found that spatially asymmetric changes produce a final steady state that is dynamic, and that spatially symmetric changes produce a final state that is static. Some general properties of <b>cool</b> <b>loop</b> equilibria are discussed, emphasizing the relationship between structure and energy input. The results are unable to explain the net redshifts observed in emission lines formed near 100, 000 K on the sun...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, the {{existence}} of small and <b>cool</b> magnetic <b>loops</b> (height < 8 Mm, T < 10 ^ 5 K) has been proposed and debated to explain the increase of the DEM (differential emission measure) towards the chromosphere. We present hydrodynamic simulations of low-lying <b>cool</b> <b>loops</b> to study their conditions of existence and stability, and their contribution to the transition region EUV output. We find that stable, quasi-static <b>cool</b> <b>loops</b> (with velocities < 1 km/s) can be obtained under different and more realistic assumptions on the radiative losses function with respect to previous works. A mixture of the DEMs of these <b>cool</b> <b>loops</b> plus intermediate loops with temperatures between 10 ^ 5 and 10 ^ 6 K can reproduce the observed emission of the lower transition region at the critical turn-up temperature point (T ~ 2 x 10 ^ 5 K) and below T = 10 ^ 5 K.

Their tasks included hooking up heater and data cables for PMA-3, removing thermal covers and launch locks on Cupola, and installing handrails on Tranquility and a video cable for another base to be installed on the Russian segment of the ISS. Bob Behnken also connected the second ammonia <b>cooling</b> <b>loop</b> and disconnected a temporary power cable on Tranquility. Once the launch locks were removed, pilot Terry Virts opened the windows on Cupola for the first time.

2500|$|The basic {{operation}} of the CANDU design is similar to other nuclear reactors. Fission reactions in the reactor core heat pressurized water in a primary <b>cooling</b> <b>loop.</b> A heat exchanger, {{also known as a}} steam generator, transfers the heat to a secondary <b>cooling</b> <b>loop,</b> which powers a steam turbine with an electric generator attached to it (for a typical Rankine thermodynamic cycle). The exhaust steam from the turbines is then cooled, condensed and returned as feedwater to the steam generator. The final cooling often uses cooling water from a nearby source, such as a lake, river, or ocean. Newer CANDU plants, such as the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station near Toronto, Ontario, use a diffuser to spread the warm outlet water over a larger volume and limit the effects on the environment.|$|E
2500|$|The ITER tokamak {{will use}} three {{interconnected}} cooling systems.

40|$|Minimal {{observational}} {{evidence exists}} for fast transition region (TR) upflows {{in the presence}} of <b>cool</b> <b>loops.</b> Observations of such occurrences challenge notions of standard solar atmospheric heating models, as well as their description of bright TR emission. Using the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode, we observe fast upflows (v_λ < - 10 km s^- 1) over multiple TR temperatures (5. 8 < T < 6. 0) at the footpoint sites of a <b>cool</b> <b>loop</b> (T < 6. 0). Prior to <b>cool</b> <b>loop</b> energizing, asymmetric flows of + 5 km s^- 1 and - 60 km s^- 1 are observed at footpoint sites. These flows speeds and patterns occur simultaneously with both magnetic flux cancellation (at site of upflows only) derived from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDOs) Helioseismic Magnetic Imager's (HMI) line-of-sight magnetogram images, and a 30 % mass in-flux at coronal heights. The incurred non-equilibrium structure of the <b>cool</b> <b>loop</b> leads to a catastrophic cooling event, with subsequent plasma evaporation indicating the TR as the heating site. From the magnetic flux evolution we conclude that magnetic reconnection between the footpoint and background field are responsible for observed fast TR plasma upflows.

40|$|EUV {{observations}} show many {{active region}} loops in lines formed at temperatures between 10, 000 and 2, 000, 000 K. The brightest loops {{are associated with}} flux tubes leading to the umbrae of sunspots. It is shown that the high visibility of certain loops in transition region lines is due principally to a sharp radial decrease of temperature to chromospheric values toward the loop axis. The plasma density of these <b>cool</b> <b>loops</b> is not significantly greater than in the hot gas immediately surrounding it. Consequently, the internal gas pressure of the cool material is clearly lower. The hot material immediately surrounding the <b>cool</b> <b>loops</b> is generally denser than the external corona by a factor 3 - 4. When the active region is examined in coronal lines, this hot high pressure plasma shows up as loops that are generally parallel to the <b>cool</b> <b>loops</b> but significantly displaced laterally...|$|R
40|$|Static {{models of}} coronal loops are investigated. For loops that are low-lying with heights above the {{chromosphere}} below about 5000 km, it is {{shown that a}} new type of solution appears to the static equations, in addition to the well-known coronal loop solution. The new solution is characterized by a maximum plasma temperature less than about 100, 000 K. The structure and properties of these cool solutions are discussed. The differential emission measure Q(T) expected for a magnetic arcade, which must naturally contain both hot and <b>cool</b> <b>loops,</b> is calculated. It is shown that the <b>cool</b> <b>loops</b> have a dramatic effect on the form of Q(T) in the lower transition region.

2500|$|Where the CANDU design differs is {{details of}} the fissile core and the primary <b>cooling</b> <b>loop.</b> Natural uranium {{consists}} of a mix of mostly uranium-238 with small amounts of uranium-235 and trace amounts of other isotopes. Fission in these elements releases high-energy neutrons, which can cause other U-235 atoms in the fuel to undergo fission as well. This process is much more effective when the neutron energies are much lower than what the reactions release naturally. Most reactors use some form of neutron moderator to lower {{the energy of the}} neutrons, or [...] "thermalize" [...] them, which makes the reaction more efficient. The energy lost by the neutrons heats the moderator and is extracted for power.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, the {{well-established}} {{pressurized water}} reactors (PWR) have a primary <b>cooling</b> <b>loop</b> of liquid water at a subcritical pressure, transporting {{heat from the}} reactor core to a secondary <b>cooling</b> <b>loop,</b> where the steam for driving the turbines is produced in a boiler (called the steam generator).Boiling water reactors (BWR) operate at even lower pressures, with the boiling process to generate the steam happening in the reactor core.|$|E
