40|$|Diamond and {{diamond-like}} films {{grown by}} the torch flame method have been analysed by different techniques, namely scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} and <b>catholuminescence</b> microscopy, in order to investigate the main structural features of the different habits present in the films. A correlation between the observed crystal habits, the defect structure {{and the formation of}} diamond and/or diamond-like phases has been established. This enables a general quality assessment of the deposits and their correlation with some features usually observed in carbon film...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} <b>catholuminescence</b> (CL) {{spectroscopy}} {{study of a}} {{high pressure high temperature}} (HPHT) B-doped diamond implanted with hydrogen. CL spectra were acquired with different electron beam energies, allowing the analysis from different depths of the sample. In this way both the implanted layer and the boundary region were investigated. Several features were detected, related both to the acceptor compensation and to lattice damage from the ion implantation process. The sample was subsequently annealed (temperatures up to 1000 degreesC) and the behaviour of the signals was followed with CL spectroscopy, showing the changes in the lattice structure.

40|$|Abstract−Catalytic {{effect of}} metal {{elements}} {{was observed in}} the growth of GaN and Mg-doped GaN micro-crystals. High quality GaN micro-crystals were synthesized by direct reaction of gallium and ammonia using a Ni-mesh catalyst. Mg-doped GaN micro-crystals were also grown by the same reaction scheme in the presence of MgCl 2. The growth rate of GaN micro-crystals markedly increased {{in the presence of the}} catalyst. The average grain size of GaN micro-crystals synthesized in the presence of Ni and Mg metals was larger than that in the absence of the metals. The char-acterization of the catalytically grown GaN micro-crystals using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray and/or electron diffraction pattern showed the growth of dislocation free hexagonal GaN micro-crystals. Photoluminescence (PL) and <b>Catholuminescence</b> (CL) measurements also showed the growth of good quality n- and p-type GaN micro-crystals using Ni catalys...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} structural characterisation {{of synthetic}} diamond films, previously investigated as UV photodetectors, {{has been carried}} out by SEM, X-ray diffraction, <b>catholuminescence</b> (CL), micro-Raman spectroscopy and micro-photoluminescence. The films were deposited by microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition using a CH 4 -CO 2 gas mixture. The effect of a systematic change of the methane concentration on film morphology, preferential orientation and crystal quality has been investigated at two different substrate temperatures, 750 °C and 850 °C. A strong decrease of both band-A CL and width of the diamond Raman line at 1332 cm- 1 has been observed, at lower substrate temperature, going towards (1 0 0) texturing, consistent with the attribution of band-A luminescence to the presence of structural defects such as dislocations. A strong correlation between methane-induced texturing and UV detector performance has been evidenced: poorly oriented films exhibit a better UV photoresponse than highly textured films. Raman and luminescence measurements suggest that the limiting factor for the detector performance is related, rather than to structural defects to centres of different nature, whose density strongly depends on the sample preferential orientation...|$|E
40|$|Anisotropic {{electron}} mobilities for GaAs/Insub 0. 2 Gasub 0. 8 As/Alsub 0. 3 Gasub 0. 7 As inverted high {{electron mobility}} transistor structures were observed using Hall effect measurements. If the Insub 0. 2 Gasub 0. 8 As quantum-well thickness {{is below the}} critical layer thickness, a higher electron mobility in the (01 - 1) direction is observed {{in comparison to the}} (011) direction. Exceeding the critical layer thickness of the Insub 0. 2 Gasub 0. 8 As quantum well results in a change in the behavior of the anisotropy, and a highly anisotropic electron mobility with a higher electron mobility in the (011) direction, in comparison to the (01 - 1) direction, is observed. With increasing Insub 0. 2 Gasub 0. 8 As quantum-well width, the anisotropy increases. An increase of the anisotropy was also observed if the Hall-effect measurements were carried out at lower temperatures. The anisotropy in the electron mobility can be correlated to the occurrence of a highly asymmetric-dislocation density. The asymmetry in the dislo cation density was observed using wavelength-selective <b>catholuminescence</b> measurements...|$|E
40|$|Oxygen‐isotope ratio (δ¹⁸O) {{data are}} {{presented}} for 55 belemnite rostra specimens of late Aptian–Albian age from the Great Artesian Basin of eastern Australia and of late Barremian–early Cenomanian age from the Carnarvon Basin of Western Australia. The belemnites were carefully screened for diagenesis {{by means of}} <b>catholuminescence</b> and trace element geochemistry. The δ¹⁸O record for the Carnarvon Basin (palaeolatitude ~ 40 °S) is interpreted to show a long‐term warming trend from ~ 10 °C in the Aptian {{to a maximum of}} ~ 15 °C in the Cenomanian. Shorter-term fluctuations in the mid-Albian are also apparent. Data from the Great Artesian Basin (palaeolatitude 40 °– 55 °S) show a wider δ¹⁸O range which is attributed to the epeiric sea context of this sample set. The larger range in δ¹⁸O is interpreted to reflect differing water mass characteristics, due possibly to a combination of variable freshwater dilution, seasonal temperature fluctuations and isotopic exchange between seawater and pyroclastic sediment within the epeiric sea. Nevertheless, the Aptian–Albian δ¹⁸O trends are still comparable to those obtained for the Carnarvon Basin. The inferred palaeotemperature trends for the Australian sedimentary basins are consistent with records from other regions and demonstrate that broadly synchronous palaeotemperature variations can be recognised on a global scale during the Cretaceous. Although our data do indeed show cool temperatures within the Aptian (and the Albian) reaching a low of ~ 10 °C, these estimates are somewhat warmer than those based on glendonite genesis. However, the exact position of the glendonite-bearing and dropstone-rich parts of the Bulldog Shale is poorly constrained with respect to our isotope data, and the warmest temperatures were of late Albian and early Cenomanian age. However, to conform to greenhouse warmth and equability, and to achieve parity with other palaeotemperature records, the δ¹⁸O(seawater) estimate of − 1. 0 ‰ that is generally used for Cretaceous oceans in an ice-free world needs to be adjusted to a slightly higher value...|$|E
