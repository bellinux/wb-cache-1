5|$|The {{understanding}} of thermodynamics was limited {{at the start}} of the 19th century, when it was believed that the key to the successful storage to ice was the construction of underground ice houses, where it was believed, incorrectly, that it would always be <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> store ice successfully. European ice houses were based on this theory, and used underground chambers, often built at considerable expense, to store the winter harvest. Some farmers in Virginia, however, had developed much cheaper icehouses, elevated off the ground, built from wood and insulated with hay. In addition to the temperature that ice was held at, there was also a need to efficiently drain off the melted water, as this water would further melt the remaining ice much faster than warm air would do.|$|E

50|$|The cycling {{historian}} Raymond Henry says repairs before Rustin’s invention {{were made}} by cutting a patch from a discarded air tube, scraping it with a file, then cleaning it with petrol. The repair patch and punctured tube were then coated with rubber solution and each heated above a flame until the rubber had reached the correct temperature and softeness. The patch was then pressed on to the air tube and held until the rubber had <b>cooled</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make the attachment permanent.|$|R
25|$|Class L dwarfs {{get their}} {{designation}} {{because they are}} cooler than M stars and L is the remaining letter alphabetically closest to M. Some of these objects have masses large enough to support hydrogen fusion and are therefore stars, but most are of substellar mass and are therefore brown dwarfs.

25|$|In a fire, PVC-coated wires {{can form}} {{hydrogen}} chloride fumes; the chlorine serves to scavenge free radicals {{and is the}} source of the material's fire retardance. While hydrogen chloride fumes can also pose a health hazard in their own right, it dissolves in moisture and breaks down onto surfaces, particularly in areas where the air is <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> breathe, and is not available for inhalation. Frequently in applications where smoke is a major hazard (notably in tunnels and communal areas), PVC-free cable insulation is preferred, such as low smoke zero halogen (LSZH) insulation.|$|E
25|$|A {{nuclear reactor}} {{is only part}} of the {{life-cycle}} for nuclear power. The process starts with mining (see Uranium mining). Uranium mines are underground, open-pit, or in-situ leach mines. In any case, the uranium ore is extracted, usually converted into a stable and compact form such as yellowcake, and then transported to a processing facility. Here, the yellowcake is converted to uranium hexafluoride, which is then enriched using various techniques. At this point, the enriched uranium, containing more than the natural 0.7% U-235, is used to make rods of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor that the fuel is destined for. The fuel rods will spend about 3 operational cycles (typically 6 years total now) inside the reactor, generally until about 3% of their uranium has been fissioned, then they will be moved to a spent fuel pool where the short lived isotopes generated by fission can decay away. After about 5 years in a spent fuel pool the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> handle, and it can be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed.|$|E

50|$|The flask is {{then put}} back together, and metal can be {{poured into the}} mold. The metal will flow down the sprue, into the mold cavity, and back up the riser (of which there may be several). Once the metal has <b>cooled</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> solidify, the flask can then be {{separated}} again, and the sand removed to reveal the rough casting. The rough casting is separated from the sprue and riser(s) either by sawing them off, or just breaking the thin metal of the gates and runners.|$|R

25|$|Through {{much of the}} {{few minutes}} {{after the big bang}} during which {{nucleosynthesis}} could have occurred, the temperature was high enough that the mean energy per particle was greater than the binding energy of weakly bound deuterium; therefore any deuterium that was formed was immediately destroyed. This situation is known as the deuterium bottleneck. The bottleneck delayed formation of any helium-4 until the universe became <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> form deuterium (at about a temperature equivalent to 100 keV). At this point, there was a sudden burst of element formation (first deuterium, which immediately fused to helium). However, very shortly thereafter, at twenty minutes after the Big Bang, the universe became too cool for any further nuclear fusion and nucleosynthesis to occur. At this point, the elemental abundances were nearly fixed, with the only change as some of the radioactive products of big bang nucleosynthesis (such as tritium) decay. The deuterium bottleneck in the formation of helium, together with the lack of stable ways for helium to combine with hydrogen or with itself (there are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of five or eight) meant that an insignificant amount of carbon, or any elements heavier than carbon, formed in the Big Bang. These elements thus required formation in stars. At the same time, the failure of much nucleogenesis during the Big Bang ensured that there would be plenty of hydrogen in the later universe available to form long-lived stars, such as our Sun.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Screen Rant, Alex Leadbeater felt, {{regardless}} of the short's connections to Logan and Deadpool 2, it [...] "ultimately is a good slice of Deadpool fun." [...] Leadbeater also praised the alternate online release, as pirated versions of the theatrical showings had already appeared online and the extra scenes in the official online version were incentive for fans to watch the official release over the illegal ones. Trent Moore of Blastr called the short [...] "a fun little scene", and said that Leitch [...] "certainly {{seems to have a}} solid grasp of the irreverent tone that makes the character work so well." [...] Jacob Hall at /Film said the short was a [...] "fun little surprise" [...] and compared it to Marvel Studios' Marvel One-Shots. He added that there is [...] "not much to judge quite yet, but [...] does showcase a strong eye for comedy" [...] in the footage, and particularly noted the [...] "ridiculously depressing and dilapidated" [...] setting.

50|$|Several {{methods of}} {{compression}} may be used: liquid ring, reciprocating, or centrifugal. The chlorine gas is compressed {{at this stage}} and may be further cooled by inter- and after-coolers.

Non condensible gases and remaining chlorine gas are vented off {{as part of the}} pressure control of the liquefaction systems.

2500|$|Temperature [...] affects {{cellular}} metabolic {{and growth}} rates. Seeds from different species and even seeds {{from the same}} plant germinate {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. Seeds often have a temperature range within which they will germinate, and they will not do so above or below this range. Many seeds germinate at temperatures slightly above 60-75 F (16-24 C) , while others germinate just above freezing and others germinate only in response to alternations in temperature between warm and cool. Some seeds germinate when the soil is cool 28-40 F (-2 - 4 C), and some when the soil is warm 76-90 F (24-32 C). [...] Some seeds require exposure to cold temperatures (vernalization) to break dormancy. Some seeds in a dormant state will not germinate even if conditions are favorable. Seeds that are dependent on temperature to end dormancy have a type of physiological dormancy. [...] For example, seeds requiring the cold of winter are inhibited from germinating until they take in water in the fall and experience cooler temperatures. Cold stratification is a process that induces the dormancy breaking prior to light emission that promotes germination [...] Four degrees Celsius is <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> end dormancy for most cool dormant seeds, but some groups, especially within the family Ranunculaceae and others, need conditions cooler than -5 C. Some seeds will only germinate after hot temperatures during a forest fire which cracks their seed coats; this is a type of physical dormancy.|$|E
2500|$|According to the ethnohistorical record, the yaupon {{leaves and}} {{branches}} {{used for the}} black drink were traditionally picked {{as close to the}} time of its planned consumption as possible. After picking, historically they were lightly parched in a ceramic container over fire. The roasting increases the solubility in water of the caffeine, which is the same reason coffee beans are roasted. After browning, they were boiled in large containers of water until the liquid reached a dark brown or black color, giving it its name. The liquid was then strained into containers to cool, until it was <b>cool</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> not scald the skin, and drunk while still hot. Because caffeine is 30 times more soluble in boiling water than room temperature water, this heightened its effect. It was then consumed in a ritual manner. Its physiological effects are believed to be mainly those of massive doses of caffeine. Three to six cups of strong coffee is equal to 0.5 to 1.0 grams of caffeine; the black drink could have delivered at least this much and possibly up to 3.0 to 6.0 grams of caffeine. Owen gives the caffeine content of coffee as between 1.01 and 1.42 percent [...] In comparison, Ilex vomitoria leaves contain 0.0038 to 0.2288 percent caffeine by weight according to experiments performed by Adam Edwards in 2002. Similar methods of production were adopted by European colonists for the production of a drink that often shared the same names with Native names for the black drink but used for different, secular purposes.|$|E
