40|$|In {{the context}} of {{economic}} globalisation, the unequal distribution of wealth among nations often leads to infringe fundamental workers' rights, so {{that it has become}} a major concern for politicians, scholars, jurists and NGOs. Therefore the question is how the social market can be regulated today. The ILO is the first international organisation that has dealt with workers' rights, especially fundamental rights, its goal being to protect workers universally. If its legitimacy had been unquestioned for years, it is shattered by external economic factors today: state's loss of power in regulating social relations, the emergence of new political counterbalances on the international scene [...] -unknown by international public law [...] -and self-governance by social labels or codes of conducts. The author will attempt, by a critical appraisal, to demonstrate that the ILO has its own constitutional and logistical means to implement fundamental workers' rights efficiently and independently: union freedom and collective negotiation, prohibition of hard labour, prohibition of child labour, prohibition of discrimination. According to the author, the ILO is undergoing an institutional transition. The latter is adapting to the new economic context. In Geneva <b>centralised</b> <b>procedures</b> are still very centralised but they are in the same time counterweighted by local actions or soft procedures.

40|$|In this paper, we {{touch on}} a key theme in rural overnance 'the {{reconciliation}} of <b>centralised</b> <b>procedures</b> and the embedded institutions of rural society – {{through the lens}} of the evaluation procedures embedded in the European LEADER programme. LEADER is in many ways a highly devolved European initiative, true to its origins as a progressive rural laboratory in terms of innovation, stakeholder engagement, social learning and systemic methodology for addressing rural needs. The design and operationalisation of national and local LEADER programmes and projects is tailored to local circumstances, and aims to direct LEADER funding to local needs while building the institutional and social capital that underpins successful rural development. Yet while the delivery of LEADER embraces heterogeneity, programmatic evaluation is centralised and learning at the national and local level is subservient to the need to defend the LEADER approach in Brussels. This requires evaluation to be held at arms length from delivery organisations, even though there is evidence that where local evaluative capacity is robust, centralised evaluation is enhanced. This paper reviews progress to date on improving the canonical forms of evaluation employed in LEADER, based on cumulative feedback from previous iterations of the programme. We then consider alternative evaluation traditions that engage with endogenous capacity for sense making,and {{the extent to which they}} might be taken up within LEADER. We conclude by proposing that more attention needs to be paid to institutionalisation of systemic evaluation within LEADER,which could engage with a much wider range of perspectives in rural development, across different scales of governance and national and regional contexts. This would require the reconciliation canonical and endogenous forms of evaluation, but would align LEADER evaluation with the values and methods embodied in the rest of the programme...|$|R

40|$|Magister Artium - MAThis {{research}} study {{seeks to investigate}} how institutional arrangements impact on intra-party democracy in Malawi. Intra-party democracy is essential as it promotes party unity through reduced fragmentation and factionalism, encourages a culture of democratic debate and deliberation of critical issues within the party and therefore collective ownership of decisions. Further, it creates legitimate internal conflict management systems and finally, reduces opportunistic and arbitrary use of delegated authority. These are fundamental tenets of any functioning democratic entity. These elements of intra-party democracy are attainable if they are formerly stipulated and governed by the party’s constitutional rules. Where such rules either do not exist or are not effectively enforced, major operational problems arise. These may include: non-inclusive candidate selection <b>procedures,</b> <b>centralised</b> coalition negotiation processes, unprocedural conflict management mechanisms and unconstitutional or illegitimate party conventions. Consequently, the resulting outcomes include party instability and factionalism stimulated by resignations and expulsions, declining electoral support and weak coalitions. These factors undermine the party’s contribution to democracy. The next section gives the context and historical evolution of parties in Malawi. South Afric...|$|R

Requirements for the protection of biometric information. Traditional biometric authentication systems store biometric templates together with the data identifying an individual in a database for later comparison. In order to authenticate an individual the biometric data presented is looked up in the database. If a record is found with biometric data that is sufficiently close to that presented, the person is identified. However, the storage of biometric data leads to considerable risks for the authentication system and raises serious concerns regarding data protection.

40|$|In {{the search}} for the “ 28 th model“, a glance at the European acquis communautaire could lead us to assume that {{intellectual}} property is in the vanguard and that the establishment of an optional instrument {{has proven to be a}} model of success. All that was actually created, however, were two supranational legal systems, namely in trade mark law and in design law. The terrain for these two regulations, from 1993 and 2002, respectively, was certainly well-cleared, for the corresponding national regimes had for the most part already been harmonised via directives in 1988 and 1998. These two EU regulations thus did not compete with the national legal systems so much in terms of content as with respect to their geographic scope. A registrant primarily chooses EU legal title when he or she intends to do business in the EU and not strictly within national boundaries. The European Patent Convention (1973), on the contrary, is not only not a legal entity of the EU, but it also is based on an independent supranational construct, the European Patent Organisation. Furthermore, the Convention's intended purpose is limited to <b>centralising</b> the <b>procedures</b> leading up to the grant of patents for the participating, currently 38, member states. Once granted, however, the so-called bundle patents are for the most part on a par with the nationally granted patents. A true supranational patent-law title has not been achieved yet, despite decades-long efforts. The “enhanced cooperation“ between 25 member states (Spain and Italy not included) that is currently being discussed will likewise not be able to stand in for an EU patent - not to mention the open question of whether business and industry would even accept such a construct. In the area of copyright, again, certain vague ideas have recently been brought into play that point towards an EU right, though without any concrete details, and such a thing as an EU copyright - assuming discussion on this topic does not soon fade away on its own - certainly lies far in the future. It is especially striking that agreements on intellectual property rights - which practically speaking are incredibly important - have never played a part in the previous initiatives for a unifi ed European contract law. It is in relation to just these types of contracts that an optional “ 28 th model“ seems the most obvious choice for markedly increasing legal certainty in the outcome of court disputes. Indeed, more innovation and competitiveness cannot be gained through the abstract reinforcement of legal protection alone; what is further necessary is a knowledge transfer as comprehensive as possible. First and foremost, this requires an appropriate contract law that is capable of providing for the particularities of each contractual subject...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{evidence on}} the relationships between patient throughput and costs and outcomes indicate that, for cardiac and vascular surgery, outcomes are better in units with high rates of patient activity. However, the gains to increasing throughput are most substantial at rates of activity below those currently being achieved in New South Wales (NSW). Research evidence on economies of scale is sparse and unimpressive but suggests that further cost savings are minimal at rates of throughput in excess of 100 cases per annum. The impression from practice in NSW is that larger units have lower average costs. However, {{this is not necessarily}} a scale effect and does not constitute an argument for centralising services. Projected increases in the rates of activity will ensure that whatever economies of scale which do exist are realised without the need for reorganisation. In the short term, gains in efficiency may be better realised by management audit within units shown to have higher costs or poorer outcomes. The available research evidence on cardiac surgery suggests that units should be performing at least 300 open heart procedures per annum. It does not support arguments that units should be performing a minimum of 900 procedures per annum unless this includes closed heart procedures in addition to open heart surgery. For renal transplantation, the evidence is less conclusive and clinical opinion more divided. There are gains to be made in <b>centralising</b> surgical <b>procedures</b> but the extent of these gains is small in comparison to the total costs and outcome of managing the patient in end stage renal failure. Patient costs are dominated by the need for ongoing immuno-suppressive therapy and {{it has been argued that}} final outcome is influenced more by the medical management of the patient before and after surgery. The effect of centralisation of surgical services on organ supply also needs to be considered. The small benefit of centralised surgery may be more than offset by a reduction in organ donation. On the evidence available there is little to suggest that at current rates of activity, scale effects on costs and outcomes should influence decisions about the size or location of tertiary services. Economies of scale in cardiac surgery will be realised naturally. Variations in cost and outcome do exist in both cardiac surgery and renal transplantation but do not appear to be related to patient throughput in ways which can be exploited through centralisation. Differences in the performance of units appear independent of scale. The reasons for these differences (efficiency or case-mix) warrant closer examination by management or peer-review in-hospital rather than by the macro-approach adopted here. Two extensive sources of data containing information on the outcomes of surgery (the databases held by the National Heart Foundation and ANZDATA) could not be fully exploited for reasons of confidentiality. The feasibility of linking these data sets to estimates of cost and subjecting the information to independent confidential analysis should be explored.

40|$|This study aims to {{comparatively}} {{explore how}} the politicisation {{of criminal justice}} would appear in several new democracies with the institutional combination of presidentialism and a civil-law prosecution system, {{by focusing on the}} strategic interaction between an incumbent president and prosecutors, in South Korea and Russia, in the new institutionalist perspective. Civil-law prosecutors could damage particular politicians’ moral foundations with specific timing and extent, manipulating criminal proceedings through their broad power within the <b>centralised</b> criminal <b>procedure.</b> This is why they must be cautiously checked by any other body of government, contrary to their common-law counterparts who exercise a limited power due to the decentralised criminal procedure. Fortunately, in most civil-law countries, prosecutors are accountable to democratic bodies, in spite of the global tendency of judicial independence. Also in practice, civil-law prosecutors have not often been involved in the politicisation of criminal justice, despite their extensive influence over criminal procedure, in the continental European countries wherein the tradition of parliamentary supremacy is strong. By contrast, in new democracies with the institutional combination between a civil-law prosecution system and presidentialism, prosecutors have often taken partisan behaviour in favour of or against an incumbent president. For instance, two South Korean Presidents, Young-sam Kim and Dae-jung Kim, and Russian President Boris Yel’tsin, had exploited civil-law prosecutors for the politicisation of criminal justice, but were faced with their defection immediately before their retirement. Unusually, only Vladimir Putin could avoid this unfortunate fate, even at the last phase of his tenure, among the South Korean and Russian Presidents after democratisation. According to this study, high-ranking prosecutors generally pursued their own career advancement, and consequently the prosecution service was loyal to an incumbent president during most of his tenure, but betray him in his last phase, during South Korean President Young-sam Kim’s and Dae-jung Kim’s periods, and in Russian President Yel’tsin’s period. Only in the Russian President Putin period in the two countries after democratisation, prosecutors unusually continued to serve the president even when he left the presidency. This could be because they had no incentive to betray the outgoing president in order to further their career development under the next presidency, given that Putin would undoubtedly maintain a strong political influence over their careers, even after his retirement, according to this research. On the other hand, South Korean President Moo-hyun Roh frequently came into conflict with prosecutors, and had his close allies investigated or even indicted by them, during his entire period, while repeatedly attempting major reform against the civil-law prosecution service, which President Young-sam Kim and Dae-jung Kim had abandoned, {{in order to maintain the}} alliance with the power apparatus. According to this study, prosecutors made their organisational resistance based on their far-reaching power over criminal procedure, against President Moo-hyun Roh, for protecting their great prerogative, and therefore he failed in the reform. By contrast, Russian President Putin was exceptionally successful in large-scale reform against civil-law prosecutors, which not only President Yel’tsin but Putin himself in his first term had also suspended, by establishing the new ‘investigative committee’ in June 2007. According to this research, this outcome was possible because the prosecutors could no longer enjoy the political opportunity structure enabling them to effectively defeat the president’s reform against their collective interests, and consequently President Putin could circumvent their organisational resistance, in the absence of political competition under his electoral authoritarian regime. This study provides three important academic implications. Firstly, under the institutional combination of presidentialism and a civil-law prosecution system, prosecutors are not likely to preserve political neutrality, but to display a partisan behaviour either in favour of or against an incumbent government. That is, the institutional factor of combination of a civil-law prosecution system and presidentialism tends to induce the prosecution service, as a judicial body, to behave differently from the expectations of both the democrats and the liberals. Secondly, the variation of political competition can seldom influence judicial officers, who are responsible to the other branches of government, to behave independently of politicians, but can influence them, especially the top rankers, to betray an incumbent government in the last phase of its tenure on specific institutional and political conditions. Thirdly, and most importantly, the variation of political competition can influence judicial officers to take collective action for protecting their collective interests. In particular, if the judicial officers could exercise far-reaching power over criminal procedure, as civil-law prosecutors, their organisational resistance against an incumbent government which pushes for reform encroaching on their collective interests, such as prerogative powers, would be threatening enough to make the incumbent abandon the reform plan. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The 1995 - 2005 {{balance of}} EMEA {{activities}} {{in the field of}} paediatric medicines was evaluated, taking into account the number both of drugs authorised for children and paediatric studies supporting the Marketing Authorisation (MA). Methods: Data on drugs authorised by EMEA were extracted from EPARs (European Public Assessment Reports). Active substance, year of approval, anatomical, therapeutic and chemical (ATC) code, indication, orphan status, ages, and registrative clinical studies characteristics were assessed. Results: The percentage of authorised substances for paediatrics is 33. 3 %. This percentage decreased or increased when different subsets of medicines were considered [medicines for children under 2 years (23. 4 %), N-ATC code drugs (6 %) and orphan drugs (46. 4 %) ]. A total of 165 trials were included in the MA dossiers of 51 drugs at the time of approval, and additional 22 studies were added to the dossiers of 12 active substances submitted for paediatric variations. PK and Efficacy/Safety studies were performed for 32 (52 %) active substances, while either one PK or one Efficacy/Safety study was carried out for 43 (69 %) and 45 (73 %) substances, respectively.

40|$|Background: The {{selection}} of a robust bioequivalence (BE) study designs for registering a generic product remains still a hard task. This task is still challenging {{despite the fact that}} generic products are much needed by health care providers in economical terms. Thus, BE study designs could be a means to allow companies to reduce costs and reach the market earlier. We therefore investigated whether different approaches in various products assessed by the European Medicines Agency during the approval phase resulted in a reduction in resources required to show bioequivalence for different medicinal products. Methods: European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs) for off-patent medicinal products authorised within the European Union (EU) through the <b>centralised</b> <b>procedure</b> during the period 2007 – 2015 were retrieved and reviewed to identify the clinical studies that resulted in fewer number of subjects, the number of centres or trial duration versus the two-period crossover design. Results: 7 studies out of 108 were considered as having benefitted from having a different design. Differences noted included having a different dose allocation scheme, having a different number of dosing periods, having a different number of treatment arms, and having one study evaluating different strengths. Benefits noted included a {{decrease in the number of}} subjects and centres required, decreases in study duration and a reduced number of studies required to demonstrate bioequivalence. Conclusion: Bioequivalence studies can be designed in a specific manner to require fewer resources to carry out. Fewer resources required to register a medicinal product, could impart an advantage to companies (such as to be first on the market) or could even translate to making medicines more accessible (such as cheaper) to patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulatory}} system for medicinal products includes {{the existence of}} a legislative framework and a medicines agency as the regulatory body. The legislative framework for medicinal products has been amended several times so as to align it with the EU acquis communautaire, where medicinal products represent one of the best regulated and aligned areas. For the purpose of regulating the Croatian medicines market, the Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices was established in 2003 to implement the procedure of granting marketing authorisation for medicinal products, to supervise the adverse reactions of medicinal products, to conduct laboratory tests of the quality of medicines and vaccines sampled from the market, to issue licences for the manufacture and distribution of medicinal products, to monitor medicine consumption, and to inform about medicines and promote their rational use. Medical devices are regulated under a special act, and the Agency conducts entries into the register in that field and carries out vigilance over medical devices. In this way, products intended for health care on the Croatian market are of the appropriate quality, safety and efficacy, and are under the constant supervision of the competent body that assesses their risk-to-benefit ratio. Upon accession of the Republic of Croatia to full membership in the European Union, the Agency will be included in the European authorisation procedures for medicines, such as the <b>centralised</b> <b>procedure</b> in the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and above all, the mutual recognition procedure and decentralised procedure in which the role of the agencies of EU Member States is greater. This article gives an overview of the most important regulatory activities in the field of medicinal products, and the readiness of the Agency to function in the future integrated European regulatory area...|$|E
40|$|We study {{a problem}} of {{distributed}} detection of a stationary point event in a large extent wireless sensor network (), where the event influences the observations of the sensors only {{in the vicinity of}} where it occurs. An event occurs at an unknown time and at a random location in the coverage region (or region of interest ()) of the. We consider a general sensing model in which the effect of the event at a sensor node depends on the distance between the event and the sensor node; in particular, in the Boolean sensing model, all sensors in a disk of a given radius around the event are equally affected. Following the prior work reported in nikiforov 95 change_isolation, nikiforov 03 lower-bound-for-det-isolation, tartakovsky 08 multi-decision, the problem is formulated as that of detecting the event and locating it to a subregion of the as early as possible under the constraints that the average run length to false alarm () is bounded below by γ, and the probability of false isolation () is bounded above by α, where γ and α are target performance requirements. In this setting, we propose distributed procedures for event detection and isolation (namely,, and), based on the local fusion of s at the sensors. For these procedures, we obtain bounds on the maximum mean detection/isolation delay (), and on and, and thus provide an upper bound on as {γ, 1 /α}→∞. For the Boolean sensing model, we show that an asymptotic upper bound on the maximum mean detection/isolation delay of our distributed procedure scales with γ and α {{in the same way as}} the asymptotically optimal <b>centralised</b> <b>procedure</b> nikiforov 03 lower-bound-for-det-isolation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} seven GCC regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies active in the region in order to identify the strengths and weakness of the current GCC <b>centralised</b> <b>procedure.</b> The GCC regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical companies who had registered their products through the GCC centralized registration procedure and the national registration systems were recruited into the study and asked to complete the questionnaires specifically designed for this study. The regulatory review process in Oman was evaluated to identify areas for improvement in the system. Information on the total application numbers and approval dates were obtained directly from the Oman Ministry of Health archives. Another study was conducted to evaluate the regulatory review process and approval times of the remaining six GCC countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Yemen) and the GCC central registration, with respect to review time for new and existing substances, to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the process and to propose strategies that could help the policy maker in the GCC to enhance the review process. The results of the Omani regulatory system showed no significant increase (p> 0. 05) in the total number of registered pharmaceutical products from 2006 to 2010. The approval time in Oman showed that there was a significant increase in approval times for pharmaceutical products from 2006 to 2010 (p< 0. 001). The findings show that although there was an increase in the approval time for all pharmaceutical company products, the median approval time for the five year period was 117 days. This was within the time limit (4 months) fixed by the health authority for the overall registration time. The comparative study of the GCC States showed a downward trend in the median approval time for most of the GCC States, during 2008 to 2010. However, the approval time for all approved products in the GCC States during this period varied from 60 days in Qatar and Oman (2009 and 2010) to 609 days in Saudi Arabia (2008). The main reasons for the decrease in approval time in the Gulf States were due to the positive effect of the Gulf Central Registration, the rise in the number of reviewers in some GCC drug authorities, and the parallel procedure used in the regulatory approval review process. The study of the regulatory review process of the GCC central registration showed that a total of 413 products (96 NASs and 317 EASs) were approved during the period 2006 - 2010 with an overall significant increase in the EASs (p< 0. 001). The approval times increased from 107 calendar days in 2006 to 265 in 2010 (p< 0. 001). The lowest approval time was for EASs submitted by the Gulf companies (134 days) and the longest for NASs submitted by international companies (346 days) (p< 0. 001). VI Both the regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical companies agreed that the <b>centralised</b> <b>procedure</b> is an effective system for authorising medicinal products in all seven GCC countries in one procedure and is the way forward in the future but there is room for improvement in the procedure and the follow ups. They also agreed that clear guidelines, transparency of procedures, effective interactions between authorities and companies, increase in the number of the committee meetings per year, use of electronic on-line submissions will improve approval time for registration of new medicines, enhance the quality of review practice and encourage the pharmaceutical companies to use the GCC central registration system. This research has enabled development of a new model of the GCC central registration procedure to be proposed for the GCC Health Authorities which could improve patient access to medicines in the GCC states...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{important}} {{progress in}} understanding the molecular factors underlying the development of cancer and the improvement in response rates with new drugs, long-term survival is still disappointing for most common solid tumours. This might be because {{very little of the}} modest gain for patients {{is the result of the}} new compounds discovered and marketed recently. An assessment of the regulatory agencies' performance may suggest improvements. The present analysis summarizes and evaluates the type of studies and end points used by the EMEA to approve new anticancer drugs, and discusses the application of current regulations. This report is based on the information available on the EMEA web site. We identified current regulatory requirements for anticancer drugs promulgated by the agency and retrieved them in the relevant directory; information about empirical evidence supporting the approval of drugs for solid cancers through the <b>centralised</b> <b>procedure</b> were retrieved from the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). We surveyed documents for drug applications and later extensions from January 1995, when EMEA was set up, to December 2004. We identified 14 anticancer drugs for 27 different indications (14 new applications and 13 extensions). Overall, 48 clinical studies were used as the basis for approval; randomised comparative (clinical) trial (RCT) and Response Rate were the study design and end points most frequently adopted (respectively, 25 out of 48 and 30 out of 48). In 13 cases, the EPAR explicitly reported differences between arms in terms of survival: the range was 0 – 3. 7 months, and the mean and median differences were 1. 5 and 1. 2 months. The majority of studies (13 out of 27, 48 %) involved the evaluation of complete and/or partial tumour responses, with regard to the end points supporting the 27 indications. Despite the recommendations of the current EMEA guidance documents, new anticancer agents are still often approved on the basis of small single arm trials that do not allow any assessment of an ‘acceptable and extensively documented toxicity profile' and of end points such as response rate, time to progression or progression-free survival which at best can be considered indicators of anticancer activity and are not ‘justified surrogate markers for clinical benefit'. Anticipating an earlier than ideal point along the drug approval path and the use of not fully validated surrogate end points in nonrandomised trials looks like a dangerous shortcut that might jeopardise consumers' health, leading to unsafe and ineffective drugs being marketed and prescribed. The present Note for Guidance for new anticancer agents needs revising. Drugs must be rapidly released for patients who need them but not be at the expense of adequate knowledge about the real benefit of the drugs...|$|E
