This research tries to describe about the pattern of <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratory</b> in Indonesia and the factors that will encourage the <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratory’s</b> development in Indonesia.  This study also aims to identify the <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratory</b> activity as one form of transnational organized crime’s spread after globalization. This is a descriptive qualitative research, where {{the data was collected}} by using case files, and structured interviews.  This research is conducted by analyzing files of <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratory</b> cases that occurred in Indonesia in last five years. The results of this research answers questions about what factors  encourage the development of <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratory</b> in Indonesia.  These factors are, the easiness to obtain chemicals, chemical devices, and also cooperation with foreign syndicates, which often employ drugs designer to produce illegal drugs. This research concludes that the <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratory</b> can be developed in Indonesia because the perpetrator’s accesses to get basic chemicals drugs maker (precursor) are very easy, the use of controlled legal chemicals are leak frequently and it was used to make drugs, free sales of supporting chemical devices, and involvement of foreign drugs designer to teach how to make drugs. The results of this study tell that <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratory</b> will continue to increase if the minimization of the perpetrator access to produce the drugs done as early as possible.  Certainly, the phenomenon of <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratory</b> can be minimized, at least to suppress the circulation of drugs in Indonesia itself...|$|R

5000|$|Criminal organisations may {{generate}} significant income {{through the}} manufacture and trafficking of illicit drugs and their precursor chemicals. Increased involvement {{has resulted in}} larger and more sophisticated <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratories</b> being detected in Australia. In 2008-09, a record 449 <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratories</b> were detected in Australia (a 26 per cent increase from 2007-08). 67.7 per cent of <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratories</b> continue to be detected in residential locations. Over two tonnes of precursor chemicals {{for the production of}} meth/amphetamines were detected at the Australian border in 2008-09, nearly double the weight detected in 2007-08. In 2008-09, clandestine laboratory detections increased across most jurisdictions, the largest occurring in Western Australia, which increased from 30 laboratories in 2007-08 to 78 in 2008-09, an increase of 160 per cent. In the context of the Australian Illicit Drug Report, a clandestine laboratory is any concealed place where chemicals are used to produce illicit drugs. [...] Such laboratories range from crude, makeshift operations using simple processes to highly sophisticated operations using technically advanced facilities. They can be located virtually anywhere—in private residences, motel and hotel rooms, apartments, horse trailers, houseboats, boats, vehicles, buses, trucks, campgrounds and commercial establishments—and are usually very portable. Some <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratories</b> use very simple processes such as extracting cannabis oil from plants using solvents; others use complex processes involving a number of chemicals and a range of equipment to manufacture drugs such as methylamphetamine and ecstasy. Clan labs are usually discovered after they have exploded.|$|E

5000|$|Although his {{whereabouts}} were unknown, the authorities {{thought that he}} was likely hiding in the [...] "Golden Triangle" [...] (Spanish: Triángulo Dorado), an area that encompasses parts of Sinaloa, Durango, and Chihuahua in the Sierra Madre region. The region is a major producer of marijuana and opium poppy in Mexico, and its remoteness from the urban areas makes it an attractive territory for the production of synthetic drugs in <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratories</b> and for its mountains that offer potential hideouts. Guzmán reportedly commanded a sophisticated security circle of at least 300 informants and gunmen resembling the manpower equivalent to those of a head of state. His inner circle would help him move around through several isolated ranches in the mountainous area and avoid capture. He usually escaped from law enforcement using armored cars, aircraft, and all-terrain vehicles, and was known to employ sophisticated communications gadgetry and counterespionage practices. Since many of these locations in the Golden Triangle can only be reached over single-track dirt roads, local residents easily detected the arrival of law enforcement or any outsiders. Their distrust towards non-residents and their aversion towards the government, alongside a combination of bribery and intimidation, helped keep the locals loyal to Guzmán and the Sinaloa Cartel in the area. According to law enforcement intelligence, attempting to have launched an attack to capture Guzmán by air would have had similar results; his security circle would have warned him of the presence of an aircraft 10 minutes away from Guzmán's location, giving him ample time to escape the scene and avoid arrest. In addition, his gunmen reportedly carried surface-to-air missiles that may bring down aircraft in the area.|$|E

40|$|Clandestine drug {{laboratories}} The clandestine drug laboratory is {{a nationwide}} phenomenon that involves significant health hazards {{to law enforcement}} officers. Most of these laboratories manufacture methamphetamine, which is an easy drug to produce, even with limited knowledge of chemistry. Methamphetamine is an illegal stimulant {{that can be made}} with simple, over-the-counter ingredients. Other drugs manufactured in <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratories</b> include sodium gamma hydroxybutyrate, lysergic acid diethylamide, methcathinone, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), and phencyclidine [1, 2]. Most <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratories</b> in the United States are located in the Midwest and Western states, but they have become more common {{in the rest of the}} country. They can be found in a variety of locations, from a university or industrial chemical lab, to a remote cabin, hotel room, van, or trailer.

30|$|<b>Clandestine</b> <b>laboratories</b> {{established}} by the criminals are involved in drug markets to synthesize and proliferate the abuse of controlled substances. Clandestine labs are not merely associated with the synthesis of drugs but also the explosives and chemical or biological weapons. These illegal <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratories</b> have been found throughout the world (urban, rural, and metropolitan cities) to provide drugs of abuse to the illicit market. Some drugs of abuse reach black market by alternate trafficking routes from authentic sources in crude form (i.e., poppy from Afghanistan), while others are processed before the supply (i.e., garda from Cannabis and morphine from poppy resin). There are some other drugs with high potential for abuse and are easy to produce in <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratories</b> like, cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine, and heroin. Easy and cheap production of illicit drugs combined with high-profit margins is {{the main source of}} motivation to establish a clandestine laboratory (Frank and Sobol, 1990; Sobol, 2012). In such premises, not only the illicit drugs are synthesized from precursors, but also street level drugs produced by adding cutting agents (adulterants or diluents) in a highly pure drug to increase the bulk (Sulaiman et al., 2017). Tablets of different shapes and colors are also synthesized in order to change/mask the general appearance of a drug, {{so that it can be}} trafficked easily in disguise and sold in drug market.|$|E
30|$|Various {{synthetic}} or semi-synthetic {{drugs like}} cocaine, amphetamine type stimulants (ATS), and heroin are produced and processed in <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Every clan lab {{has its own}} procedures and protocols for drug synthesis and processing. A drug can be brought up in different forms like pharmaceutical tablets or raw street powder or any else, depending upon different types of adulterants or diluents and the physical modifications required for its transportation. Since a specific drug is synthesized by various <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratories,</b> {{it is likely to}} have some differences between the two samples due to slightly different synthesis protocols used or the nature and concentration of adulterants. Detailed analysis of drug samples can determine, whether the drug belongs to common source or not. The basic purpose of alterations in physical form is to deceive the law enforcement agencies and to increase the bulk.|$|E
