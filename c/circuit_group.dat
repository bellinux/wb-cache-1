5000|$|Grade {{of service}} is the {{probability}} of a call in a <b>circuit</b> <b>group</b> being blocked or delayed for more than a specified interval, expressed as a vulgar fraction or decimal fraction. This is always with reference to the busy hour when the traffic intensity is the greatest. Grade of service may be viewed independently from the perspective of incoming versus outgoing calls, and is not necessarily equal in each direction or between different source-destination pairs. [...] "Grade of Service" [...] sometimes means a measure of inbound call center traffic to verify adherence to conditions to measure the success of customers served.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{grade of}} service (GoS) is {{measured}} by looking at traffic carried, traffic offered and calculating the traffic blocked and lost. The proportion of lost calls is the measure of GoS. For cellular circuit groups an acceptable GoS is 0.02. This means that two users of the <b>circuit</b> <b>group</b> out of a hundred will encounter a call refusal during the busy hour {{at the end of}} the planning period. The grade of service standard is thus the acceptable level of traffic that the network can lose. GoS is calculated from the Erlang-B formula, as a function of the number of channels required for the offered traffic intensity.|$|E
50|$|Congestion {{is defined}} as the {{situation}} when exchanges or <b>circuit</b> <b>groups</b> are inundated with calls and are unable to serve all the subscribers.

Of that amount, $6 million was paid as a federal criminal fine; $2.7 million went to the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) natural resources fund; the Towns of Stafford and Manchester received $500,000 each to fund improvements in their sewer and water treatment system; and $300,000 was paid for recycling deionized and other wastewater at the company's Stafford, Staffordville facilities. Between 1999 and June 2001, TPCG managers at the company's Stafford, Staffordville and Manchester facilities engaged {{in a variety of}} practices that caused the facilities to discharge wastewater with higher than permitted levels of pollutants into municipal sewage treatment systems. The illegal practices included, but were not limited to, diluting potentially non-compliant wastewater samples, discarding samples with excessive levels of toxic metals, and omitting samples that were not in compliance for pH. Daniel R.

50|$|The {{telecommunications}} provider {{is usually}} {{aware of the}} required Grade of Service for a particular product. To achieve and maintain a given Grade of Service, the operator must ensure that sufficient telecommunications circuits or routes are available to meet a specific level of demand. It should also {{be kept in mind}} that too many circuits will create a situation where the operator is providing excess capacity which may never be used, {{or at the very least}} may be severely underutilized. This adds costs which must be borne by other parts of the network. To determine the correct number of circuits that are required, telecommunications service providers make use of Traffic Tables. An example of a Traffic Table can be viewed in Figure 1. It follows that in order for a telecommunications network to continue to offer a given Grade of Service, the number of circuits provided in a <b>circuit</b> <b>group</b> must increase (non-linearly) if the traffic intensity increases.|$|E

40|$|The {{alternating}} {{and continuous}} circuits produced {{different types of}} lesions in the central nervous system. Hemorrhages were common after alternating current shocks and few hemorrhages were observed in the continuous <b>circuit</b> <b>group.</b> With both types of circuits at 1000 and 500 volts potential, severe abnormalities in the nerve cells were observed. These were more marked in the continuous <b>circuit</b> <b>group.</b> A uniformly staining, shrunken, pyknotic nucleus was taken as a criterion of nerve cell death. The Purkinje cells of the cerebellum were most susceptible to the current. Injured cells were studied in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus, in the somatic motor group, among the primary sensory neurones and in the olives. Changes in the histological structure of the cells in reference to recovery have been discussed. Injury to the cerebral and cerebellar cortices occurred on the dorsal surface close to the head electrode.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine differences in blood loss and transfusion associated with a minimized cardiopulmonary bypass circuit versus a standard bypass circuit. MethodsFrom February 2005 through April 2006, 199 patients were randomized to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting with a standard cardiopulmonary bypass circuit (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn) or a minimized bypass circuit, the Medtronic Resting Heart Circuit. Laboratory perimeters (hemoglobin and platelet count), were measured at baseline, after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, and on intensive care unit admission. Lowest values recorded were noted. Blood administration was controlled by study-specific protocol orders, (transfusion for hemoglobin < 8 mg%). Patient demographic data were retrieved from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database. Blood product administration was recorded during hospital admission, and chest tube drainage as total output collected from operating room to discontinuation. Continuous variables were tested with a Wilcoxin rank test, and categoric variables with X 2 and Fisher's exact tests. ResultsHematocrit, equivalent at baseline, was higher in minimized circuit cohort at lowest point during cariopulmonary bypass (31. 5 % ± 3. 9 % vs. 25. 5 % ± 3. 7 %), after protamine (31. 6 % ± 3. 9 % vs 29. 2 % ± 3. 7 %), and on intensive care unit arrival (35. 2 % ± 4. 1 % vs 31. 8 % ± 3. 5 %, P <. 001). Similarly, platelet count was higher in minimized <b>circuit</b> <b>group</b> on intensive care unit arrival, as was lowest platelet count recorded (170 × 103 ± 48 cells/mm 3 vs 107 × 103 ± 28 cells/mm 3, P <. 0001). Time to extubation was shorter in minimized <b>circuit</b> <b>group</b> (848 ± 737 minutes vs. 526 ± 282 minutes, (P <. 01), and total chest tube drainage was lower (1124 ± 647 mL vs. 506 ± 214 mL, P <. 01). Fewer red blood cells (148 vs 19 units) were given in minimized <b>circuit</b> <b>group</b> (P <. 0001). ConclusionsA minimized cardiopulmonary bypass circuit provides less hemodilution, platelet consumption, chest tube output and lower post-operative blood loss than standard cardiopulmonary bypass. Red blood cell usage was also less. All differences are advantageous...|$|E
40|$|Background: General {{anesthesia}} often produces {{some degree}} of hypothermia and hypothermia causes much more blood loss during surgery than normothermia. Electrically heated humidifiers (EHHs) {{have been used for}} patients under general anesthesia and in the intensive care unit. However, the benefits of the EHH have not been widely reported in the literature. Methods: Patients scheduled for posterior lumbar spine fusion, were randomly assigned to a mechanically ventilated with EHH <b>circuit</b> <b>group</b> or to a conventional respiratory <b>circuit</b> <b>group.</b> Their tympanic membrane temperature was monitored every 30 min after induction up to 180 min, and perioperative blood losses, transfusion requirements during surgery, and other complications were noted. Results: Patients in the control group (n = 40) showed a lower mean body temperature at all times than immediately after induction, while the EHH group (n = 40) showed a lower body temperature from 60 minute after induction comparing to the initial temperature. Furthermore, patients in the EHH group had a higher mean body temperature than patients in the control group during surgery (35. 9 ± 0. 4 vs 35. 4 ± 0. 5, P < 0. 001). Mean intraoperative blood loss (9. 75 ± 5. 4 vs 7. 48 ± 3. 9, P = 0. 035) and transfusion requirements (57. 5 % vs 25 %, P = 0. 006) were significantly less in the EHH group, but postoperative blood loss, duration of hospitalization, and other complications were not significantly different in the two study groups. Conclusions: The use of an electrically heated humidifier did not prevent a body temperature drop under general anesthesia. However, it helped maintain body temperature and was associated less blood loss and transfusion requirement during surgery. (Korean J Anesthesiol 2011; 61 : 112 - 116...|$|E

The definitive version is available at www 3. interscience. wiley. comInternational audienceThe new phase-shifter configuration described in this report uses a negative group delay (NGD) active circuit. In this topology, a classical transmission line is set in cascade with an NGD circuit whose phase slopes are alike, but opposite, to get a constant and broadband phase shift. The proposed approach was validated through the design and measurement of a phase shifter, which exhibited a constant phase of 90 ° +- 5 ° over a 75 % relative bandwidth around 1. 6 GHz. Moreover, as the group delay of the NGD circuit compensated the transmission line one, the overall <b>circuit</b> <b>group</b> delay was kept to a small value in the operating frequency band...|$|E
40|$|This {{case series}} explores the {{benefits}} of an eight week upper limb circuit training group for an outpatient stroke population with regards to three domains of the International Classification Framework (ICF) : body structures and function; activity and participation. There were four participants {{ranging in age from}} 52 to 63 years old and in duration post-stroke from 82 to 444 days. The participants attended the group once a week. Each one hour session consisted of six exercise stations designed to include evidence based aspects of upper limb physiotherapy, such as, reach and grasp activities and fine motor skill activities. Participants were assessed by a blinded assessor at three time points; prior to the circuit training; on completion of the training and three months after completion. Outcome measures were chosen to allow interpretation across the three domains of the ICF. The results indicate a positive effect on upper limb performance for these patients with chronic stroke at completion of the eight week upper limb <b>circuit</b> <b>group.</b> Pain remained unchanged or reduced {{over the course of the}} study.

40|$|Background: Regular {{exercise}} {{during pregnancy}} provides many maternal and fetal health benefits. Heart rate (HR) {{and heart rate}} variability (HRV) are good indicators of heart health. Maternal exercise improves fetal HR and HRV. There is limited research on whether these benefits persist post-partum. Purpose: The primary {{purpose of this study}} was to examine whether fetal cardiac health benefits from maternal exercise during pregnancy persist through infant development. The secondary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of maternal exercise mode on heart measures (HR and HRV) of 1 month old infants. Methods: Pregnant women (n= 47) > 18 years of age in their 13 th- 16 th week of gestation were recruited and randomized into control, resistance, and <b>circuit</b> training <b>groups.</b> Intervention groups exercised for 45 min/day 3 - 4 days/week for 20 weeks. HR and HRV measures were taken on infants at 1 month of age. Results: Infant HR was significantly and negatively correlated with all measures of HRV with the exception of LF:HF where there was a significant, positive correlation. A significant difference in mean was found between groups on all measures of HR (p< 0. 001) and HRV (p< 0. 003) with the exception of LF:HF (p< 0. 542). HRV was significantly higher in both the resistance and <b>circuit</b> <b>groups</b> compared to control. There was no significant difference between resistance and <b>circuit</b> <b>groups</b> on all measures of HR and HRV. Conclusion: Fetal health (HR and HRV) benefits of maternal exercise persist 1 month post-partum. Exercise mode does not seem to have an effect on the magnitude of infant health benefits. More research is needed to compare the effects of aerobic, maternal exercise to other modes. M. S...|$|R
