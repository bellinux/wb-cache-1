25|$|Larger {{machines}} printing {{from two}} to sixteen colours are precisely similar in principle to the above, but differ somewhat in detail and are naturally more complex and difficult to operate. In a twelve-colour machine, for example, twelve copper rollers, each carrying one portion of the design, are arranged round a central pressure cylinder, or bowl, common to all, and each roller is driven by a common driving wheel, called the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel,</b> actuated, in most cases, by its own steam-engine or motor. Another {{difference is that the}} adjustment of pressure is transferred from the cylinder to the rollers which works in specially constructed bearings capable of the following movements: (1) Of being screwed up bodily until the rollers are lightly pressed against the central bowl; (2) of being moved to and fro sideways so that the rollers may he laterally adjusted; and (3) of being moved up or down for the purpose of adjusting the rollers in vertical direction. Notwithstanding the great latitude of movement thus provided each roller is furnished with a box-wheel, which serves the double purpose of connecting or gearing it to the driving wheel, and of affording a fine adjustment. Each roller is further furnished with its own colour-box and doctors.|$|E
40|$|Hardening distortions are {{unwanted}} {{changes in}} shape and dimension that arise during hardening of steel components. Uncontrolled distortions induce random errors to the manufacturing process, and have a strong negative impact on manufacturing costs. The distortions are not only caused by the hardening process, several factors from previous manufacturing steps including the component geometry itself contribute to varying extent. The aim of the current work is to investigate the main influencing factors on hardening distortions for serial produced gears. The investigations were done on {{two different types of}} gears for heavy-duty transmissions, <b>crown</b> <b>wheels</b> for the rear axle central gear and main shaft gears for the gearbox. The steel was produced using either continuous casting or ingot casting. For rectangular continuously cast steel, the effect of disabling magnetic stirring of the steel melt during casting was investigated, finding a strong reduction of gear runout for <b>crown</b> <b>wheels.</b> Segregations in <b>crown</b> <b>wheels</b> produced from {{the top and bottom of}} ingots were shown to go in opposite directions, producing opposite back-face tilts. For <b>crown</b> <b>wheels</b> quenched one at a time, influences of stacking level on the hardening tray were found, indicating an impact from small variations in the carburizing process, despite identical quenching conditions. For main shaft gears, horizontal loading gave considerably less roundness and runout errors but increased flatness errors compared to vertical loading. This thesis shows the complexity of the distortion phenomenon and how several factors interact and contribute to the final result. It is shown that factors with significant impact on hardening distortions for one component may be less important for another component. With this in mind, each type of component to be hardened should be produced by a manufacturing chain where each process step is carefully chosen with respect to minimizing distortions.

40|$|Defining {{manufacturing}} tolerances {{is an important}} task for a process planner before starting production of a new product or introducing new processes. One of the more complex processes to handle is the heat treatment of gears. Press quenching is a heat treatment method where the gear is mechanically forced to keep or attain the desired geometry, with less geometrical distortions in comparison to oil bath quenching. The objective {{of this paper is}} to discover how design of experiments can be used to scrutinize press quenching of bevel gears. The first part of this investigation shows how different process parameter settings influence geometry of the bevel gear. Based on the results of the experiments, predictions and statistical simulations, the outcome of the press quenching process can be estimated. Estimations for the number of defect parts then form the basis for evaluating whether the proposed tolerances meet the quality requirements. The work is based on an industrial case where 55 bevel gear <b>crown</b> <b>wheels</b> for heavy trucks are carburized and then case hardened in a Gleason press quenching machine.

[...] This engine had four blocks of three {{cylinders}} arranged in two banks set at 60 degrees (unlike the Arab which were set at 90 degrees).

A 4-speed transmission initially drove a back axle with differential with a shaft drive rather than the hazardous chains of other cars. Harry Hawker drove the car in 1920 at Brooklands but suffered a burst tyre, spinning off the circuit. The differential was replaced with a simple <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> and pinion so that the rear wheels were locked together and it was more successful in the hands of Kenelm Lee Guinness. Brakes were crude, as was usual in the period, with a foot brake acting on the transmission and a hand brake on the rear drums.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{focussed}} on improving the material yield in closed-die forging and rolling. The former {{is restricted to}} the manufacturing of heavy <b>crown</b> <b>wheels</b> and front axle beams and the latter to the hot rolling of steel slabs. To enhance the yield the commercial FE-codes Form 2 D and Dyna 3 D are used. Results from forging simulations are strengthened by full scale experiments. The research is carried out in near contact with the Swedish steel and engineering industry. In closed die forging, two bulk forming problems are treated: How to improve the tool design and how to change the pre-form geometry for decreasing the amount of material exiting the flash gap? In slab rolling, two problems related to material defects are considered: How to eliminate existing surface cracks and how to prevent the formation of voids around macro-inclusions embedded in the steel matrix? Internal voids might be the reason for scrapping the whole workpiece. Considering the forging of <b>crown</b> <b>wheels,</b> a new concept is proposed. For making the central hole of the product, the traditional method was forging a thin circular plate which was then sheared off and scrapped. Using the new technique this operation is replaced by forging a conical tap in the centre, which is then discarded. Doing so, the inner scrap material decreased with about 15 %. The idea {{has been used in}} production for seven years. – Regarding the forging of front axle beams, a quasi- 3 D method is used comprising full scale measurements of the axial material flow. Here the theoretical material yield increased 2 - 7 %. Regarding rolling, the initial surface cracks in the simulations are V-shaped with a crack angle of 6 o and of depth 5 - 20 mm. The inclusions are cylindrical and either three times harder or three times softer than the matrix. The behaviour of the cracks and the inclusions are studied as influenced by process parameters. Current industrial input data are used as a reference. – It is concluded that longitudinal cracks cannot be totally eliminated. During rolling their V-shape gradually changes to Y-shape and a remaining oxide flake separates the crack bottom surfaces. For minimizing the detrimental influence of the entrapped oxide, an early closure of the crack bottom is important. Throughout the remaining rolling schedule the entrapped oxide is then torn to pieces with large areas of virgin metal in between ensuring a strong bond. The following recommendations are given for the longitudinal cracks: Light drafts/pass {{at the beginning of the}} rolling schedule followed by heavy ones. – Contradictory to longitudinal cracks it is concluded that transversal cracks are possible to eliminate. When eliminated, the initial bottom of the crack coincides with the slab surface. No folds are formed. For the transversal cracks light drafts/pass are proposed together with reversal rolling, the latter for avoiding crack folding. – Voids are easiest formed around hard macro-inclusions in the centre of the slab. Large rolls and heavy drafts are recommended to avoid this. QC 2010072...|$|R
