5|$|Animals {{that are}} most active at dawn and dusk, when {{temperatures}} are <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E
5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is {{much less}} massive than the Sun: {{estimates}} suggest it has only 32% {{of the mass of}} the Sun. The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> the Sun and the star has a smaller radius. These factors combine to make the star only 1.24% as luminous as the Sun, and most of this is at infrared wavelengths.|$|E

50|$|The spherical {{crystals}} {{have good}} flow properties, making them easy to distribute through conventional pumps and piping and over product in direct contact chilling applications, {{allowing them to}} flow into crevices and provide greater surface contact and faster <b>cooling</b> <b>than</b> other traditional forms of ice (flake, block, shell, etc.).|$|R
50|$|Glenwood Springs has a {{generally}} mild and semi-arid climate, much more consistently stable {{than that of}} the Front Range and most of Colorado, though still decidedly continental and prone to periods of extreme weather. Microclimates dominate Glenwood Springs, with areas close to the rivers often much more damp and <b>cool</b> <b>than</b> hillsides.|$|R
5|$|During the season, three hurricanes {{developed}} from five named storms. This was below {{the average of}} 10storms per season, and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939. Four of the five storms {{developed from}} the intertropical convergence zone. The decreased activity is partially due to the westerlies extending further south than usual, {{as well as a}} persistent ridge. In addition, temperatures in the eastern United States were <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> usual. Activity through September10 was the quietest in 30years.|$|E
5|$|HD 28185 {{is similar}} to our Sun in terms of mass, radius, and luminosity. The star is on the main {{sequence}} and is generating energy by fusing hydrogen in its core. The spectral type of G5V implies HD 28185 is <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> the Sun. Like the majority of extrasolar planet host stars, HD 28185 is metal-rich relative to the Sun, containing around 173% of the solar abundance of iron. The star rotates slower than the Sun, with a period of around 30 days, compared to 25.4 days for the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, {{northwest}} winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, {{the region}} is <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.|$|E
50|$|In August 2008 Intel {{released}} {{their first}} two quad-core processors for notebooks, the Core 2 Quad Q9100 and Core 2 Extreme QX9300. As these require more power (45 W) and <b>cooling</b> <b>than</b> other Penryn processors they are not automatically compatible with all Centrino 2 notebooks. Also the Extreme version requires the GS45/GM45/PM45 chipset.|$|R
50|$|Liquids {{allow the}} {{transfer}} of more heat from the parts being <b>cooled</b> <b>than</b> air, making liquid cooling suitable for overclocking and high performance computer applications. Compared to air cooling, liquid cooling is also influenced less by the ambient temperature. Liquid cooling's comparatively low noise-level compares favorably to that of active cooling, which can become quite noisy.|$|R

5|$|The Catlins has a cool {{maritime}} temperate climate, somewhat <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> {{other parts}} of the South Island, and strongly modified by the effect of the Pacific Ocean. Winds can reach considerable strength, especially on the exposed coast; most of the South Island's storms develop to the south or southwest of the island, and thus the Catlins catches the brunt of many of these weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} {{only works}} {{if the air}} is <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> the reference temperature. If the air is hotter than that, the system becomes a positive feedback cycle, the body's fire is put out, and death follows. The system as described damps out fluctuations in temperature. Aristotle however predicted that his system would cause lung oscillation (breathing), which is possible given extra assumptions such as of delays or non-linear responses.|$|E
5|$|The redback spider's {{affinity}} for human-modified habitat has enabled it to spread to several countries via international shipping and trade. Furthermore, its tolerance to cold {{means that it}} {{has the ability to}} colonise many temperate countries with a winter climate <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> Australia. This is concerning due to the risks to people being bitten who are unaware of its venomous nature, and also to the conservation of local threatened insect species that the redback might prey upon.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, on April9, 2015, TSR updated its report, {{detailing}} its prediction of activity 45% below the 1950–2014 average, or about 50% below the recent 2005–2014 average, with 11 named storms, 5 hurricanes, 2 major hurricanes, and a cumulative ACE index of 56 units. TSR cited what {{were expected to}} be <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> average ocean temperatures across the tropical North Atlantic and Caribbean Sea as reasoning for lower activity. In addition, the report stated that if the ACE forecast for 2015 were to verify, the total values during the three-year period from 2013–2015 would be the lowest since 1992–1994, signalling a possible end to the active phase of Atlantic hurricane activity that began in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae A is not {{a typical}} LBV. It is more {{luminous}} than any other LBV in the Milky Way although possibly comparable to other supernova impostors detected in external galaxies. It does not currently lie on the S Doradus instability strip, although {{it is unclear what}} the temperature or spectral type of the underlying star actually is, and during its Great Eruption it was much <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> a typical LBV outburst. The 1890 eruption may have been fairly typical of LBV eruptions, with an early F spectral type, and {{it has been estimated that}} the star may currently have an opaque stellar wind forming a pseudo-photosphere with a temperature of 9,000 K–14,000 K which would be typical for an LBV in eruption.|$|E
5|$|Sunspots {{are visible}} as dark patches on the Sun's photosphere, and {{correspond}} to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> the surrounding photosphere, and, so, they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none {{can be seen}} at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum, sunspots tend form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Spörer's law. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.|$|E

5000|$|Using {{a laptop}} form factor, however, desktop {{replacements}} still often suffer from limitations {{similar to those}} of more mobile laptops. They usually lack the ability to accept standard PCIe expansion cards, somewhat limiting their expandability. While desktop replacements can offer better <b>cooling</b> <b>than</b> other laptops, they rarely dissipate heat efficiently enough to allow for high-end desktop-class components, and thus may not reach the same performance levels as desktop computers.|$|R
5|$|The Atlantic Ocean has a moderating {{effect on}} {{temperature}} in Jersey, as water {{has a much}} greater specific heat capacity than air and tends to heat and cool slowly throughout the year. This has a warming influence on coastal areas in winter and a cooling influence in summer. The highest temperature recorded was 36.0°C (96.8°F) on 9 August 2003, and the lowest temperature recorded was −10.3°C (13.5°F) on 5 January 1894. By comparison, higher temperatures are found in mainland United Kingdom, which achieved 38.5°C (101.3°F) in Faversham, Kent on 10 August 2003. The impact of the Atlantic Ocean and coastal winds ensure that Jersey is slightly <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> the southern and central parts of England during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|The Umpqua Valley AVA {{contains}} the drainage basin of the Umpqua River, excluding mountainous regions. The Umpqua Valley has a warmer climate than the Willamette Valley, but is <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> the Rogue Valley to the south. It {{is the oldest}} post-prohibition wine region in Oregon. Grapes grown here include Tempranillo, Baco noir, Pinot noir, Pinot gris, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Riesling, Grüner Veltliner, {{and a host of}} lesser known Vitis vinifera. The region includes two sub-AVAs, the Red Hill Douglas County, Oregon AVA, a single vineyard AVA, as well as the Elkton Oregon AVA, which was established in early 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{complex of}} {{refining}} and chemical companies is called Chemical Valley and located south of downtown Sarnia. While in 2011 {{the city had}} {{the highest level of}} particulates air pollution of any Canadian city, it has since dropped down to 30th. About 60 percent of the particulate matter, however, comes from the neighboring United States. Lake Huron is <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> the air in summer and warmer than the air in winter; therefore, it moderates Sarnia's humid continental climate, which makes temperature extremes of hot and cold less evident. In the winter, Sarnia occasionally experiences lake-effect snow from Arctic air blowing across the warmer waters of Lake Huron and condensing to form snow squalls once over land.|$|E
5|$|A {{field study}} in Brisbane found that F. rubiginosa trees often bore {{both male and}} female phase syconia at the same time, which could be {{beneficial}} for reproduction in isolated populations. The same study found that male phase syconia development persisted through the winter, showing that its wasp pollinator tolerated <b>cooler</b> weather <b>than</b> those of more tropical fig species. F. rubiginosa itself can endure <b>cooler</b> climates <b>than</b> other members of the genus.|$|R
30|$|Aqueous extract of leaf of A. calcarata were {{prepared}} using freshly collected leaves. They were surface sterilized with running tap water followed by distilled water and finally chopped into fine pieces. About 10  g of finally incised leaf was boiled with 100  ml of distilled water for 30  min. The extract {{was allowed to}} <b>cool</b> <b>than</b> filtered with Whatman No. 1 filter paper.

50|$|Dark roofs {{may become}} up to 39 °C (70 °F) hotter {{than the most}} {{reflective}} white surfaces. They transmit some of this additional heat inside the building. US Studies have shown that lightly colored roofs use 40 percent less energy for <b>cooling</b> <b>than</b> buildings with darker roofs. White roof systems save more energy in sunnier climates. Advanced electronic heating and cooling systems can moderate energy consumption and improve the comfort {{of people in the}} building.|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} of a stable star {{is in a state}} of hydrostatic equilibrium: the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star. The pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of 107 K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.|$|E
5|$|The island's {{geography}} comprises relatively low-lying mountains {{surrounding a}} central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. The island has lush vegetation, {{a product of}} its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature. Thick woodlands covered the island until the Middle Ages. As of 2013, the amount of land that is wooded in Ireland is about 11% of the total, compared with a European average of 35%. There are twenty-six extant mammal species native to Ireland. The Irish climate is very moderate and classified as oceanic. As a result, winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area. However, summers are <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> those in Continental Europe. Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.|$|E
5|$|The most ideal {{food was}} that which most closely matched the humour of human beings, i.e. {{moderately}} warm and moist. Food should preferably also be finely chopped, ground, pounded and strained {{to achieve a}} true mixture of all the ingredients. White wine {{was believed to be}} <b>cooler</b> <b>than</b> red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar. Milk was moderately warm and moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ. Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist. Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.|$|E

50|$|The use of gaseous {{hydrogen}} as a coolant {{is based on}} its properties, namely low density, high specific heat, and the highest thermal conductivity (at 0.168 W/(m·K)) of all gases; it is 7-10 times better at <b>cooling</b> <b>than</b> air. Another advantage of hydrogen is its easy detection by hydrogen sensors. A hydrogen-cooled generator can be significantly smaller, and therefore less expensive, than an air-cooled one. For stator cooling, water can be used.|$|R
