5|$|<b>Crucible</b> <b>steel</b> is steel {{that has}} been melted in a {{crucible}} rather than having been forged, {{with the result that}} it is more homogeneous. Most previous furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the steel. The early modern <b>crucible</b> <b>steel</b> industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s. Blister steel (made as above) was melted in a crucible or in a furnace, and cast (usually) into ingots.|$|E
5|$|When Grill {{returned}} to Sweden in 1768, he first lived in Stockholm where he occupied himself with trade.

5|$|Steel was {{produced}} in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use only began after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the production of blister steel and then <b>crucible</b> <b>steel.</b> With {{the invention of the}} Bessemer process in the mid-19th century, a new era of mass-produced steel began. This was followed by the Siemens-Martin process and then the Gilchrist-Thomas process that refined the quality of steel. With their introductions, mild steel replaced wrought iron.|$|E

5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England, Sheffield Castle {{was built to}} control the Saxon {{settlements}} and Sheffield developed into a small town, no larger than Sheffield City Centre. By the 14th century Sheffield was noted {{for the production of}} knives, and by 1600, overseen by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire, it had become the second centre of cutlery production in England after London. In the 1740s the <b>crucible</b> <b>steel</b> process was improved by Sheffield resident Benjamin Huntsman, allowing a much better production quality. At about the same time, Sheffield plate, a form of silver plating, was invented. The associated industries led to the rapid growth of Sheffield; the town was incorporated as a borough in 1843 and granted a city charter in 1893.|$|E
5|$|Huntsman's {{process was}} only made {{obsolete}} in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's {{invention of the}} Bessemer converter, but production of <b>crucible</b> <b>steel</b> continued {{until well into the}} 20th century for special uses, as Bessemer's steel was not of the same quality, in the main replacing wrought iron for such applications as rails. Bessemer had tried to induce steelmakers to take up his improved system, but met with general rebuffs, and finally was driven to undertake the exploitation of the process himself. To this end he erected steelworks in Sheffield. Gradually the scale of production was enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally became aware that the firm of Henry Bessemer & Co. was underselling them to the extent of £20 a ton. One of Bessemer's converters can still be seen at Sheffield's Kelham Island Museum.|$|E
5|$|During the 1740s, {{a form of}} the <b>crucible</b> <b>steel</b> {{process was}} {{discovered}} that allowed the manufacture of {{a better quality of}} steel than had previously been possible. In about the same period, a technique was developed for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot to produce silver plating, which became widely known as Sheffield plate. These innovations spurred Sheffield's growth as an industrial town, but the loss of some important export markets led to a recession in the late 18th and early 19thcentury. The resulting poor conditions culminated in a cholera epidemic that killed 402people in 1832. The population of the town grew rapidly throughout the 19thcentury; increasing from 60,095 in 1801 to 451,195 by 1901. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1842 and was granted a city charter in 1893. The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, and a number of new reservoirs were constructed {{on the outskirts of the}} town.|$|E

5|$|In the 1740s Benjamin Huntsman, a clock {{maker in}} Handsworth, invented {{a form of}} the <b>crucible</b> <b>steel</b> process for making {{a better quality of}} steel than had {{previously}} been available. At around the same time Thomas Boulsover invented a technique for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot producing a form of silver plating that became known as Sheffield plate. Originally hand-rolled Old Sheffield Plate was used for making silver buttons. Then in 1751 Joseph Hancock, previously apprenticed to Boulsover's friend Thomas Mitchell, first used it to make kitchen and tableware. This prospered and in 1762–65 Hancock built the water-powered Old Park Silver Mills at the confluence of the Loxley and the Don, one of the earliest factories solely producing an industrial semi-manufacture. Eventually Old Sheffield Plate was supplanted by cheaper electroplate in the 1840s. In 1773 Sheffield was given a silver assay office. In the late 18th century, Britannia metal, a pewter-based alloy similar in appearance to silver, was invented in the town.|$|E
25|$|Two {{decades before}} the Industrial Revolution an {{improvement}} {{was made in}} the production of steel, which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for cutting edge tools and for springs. Benjamin Huntsman developed his <b>crucible</b> <b>steel</b> technique in the 1740s. The raw material for this was blister steel, made by the cementation process.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1800s, the Lackawanna Valley in Pennsylvania was rich in anthracite coal and iron deposits. Brothers George W. Scranton and Seldon T. Scranton moved to the valley in 1840 and settled in the five-house town of Slocum's Hollow (now Scranton) to establish an iron forge. Although Europeans had been making steel for nearly three centuries, the processes for creating blister steel and <b>crucible</b> <b>steel</b> were slow and extremely expensive.|$|E

50|$|Some {{five years}} later, Disston built a furnace—perhaps the first melting plant for steel in America—and began {{producing}} the first <b>crucible</b> saw <b>steel</b> ever {{made in the}} United States.

Disston subsequently constructed a special rolling mill exclusively for saw blades.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries, the English {{steelmakers}} produced blister and <b>crucible</b> <b>steel</b> which required specialized equipment like finery forges and puddling furnaces and cost over £50 per long ton. In the 18th century, innovations like steamboats, railroads, and guns {{increased demand for}} wrought iron and steel. The Mount Savage Iron Works in Maryland was {{the largest in the}} United States in the late 1840s, and the first in the nation to produce heavy rails for the construction of railroads. In the 1850s, American William Kelly and Englishman Henry Bessemer independently discovered that air blown through the molten iron increases its temperature by oxidizing the carbon and separating additional impurities into the slag. The Kelly-Bessemer process, because it reduces the amount of coke needed for blasting and increases the quality of the finished iron, revolutionized the mass production of high-quality steel and facilitated a drastic drop in steel prices and expansion of its availability.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} famous steels {{produced}} in the medieval Near East was Damascus steel used for swordmaking, and mostly produced in Damascus, Syria, in the period from 900 to 1750. This was produced using the <b>crucible</b> <b>steel</b> method, based on the earlier Indian wootz steel. This process was adopted in the Middle East using locally produced steels. The exact process remains unknown, but it allowed carbides to precipitate out as micro particles arranged in sheets or bands within the body of a blade. Carbides are far harder than the surrounding low carbon steel, so swordsmiths could produce an edge that cut hard materials with the precipitated carbides, while the bands of softer steel let the sword as a whole remain tough and flexible. A team of researchers based at the Technical University of Dresden that uses X-rays and electron microscopy to examine Damascus steel discovered the presence of cementite nanowires and carbon nanotubes. Peter Paufler, a member of the Dresden team, says that these nanostructures give Damascus steel its distinctive properties and are a result of the forging process.|$|E
500|$|<b>Crucible</b> <b>steel,</b> {{formed by}} slowly {{heating and cooling}} pure iron and carbon (typically {{in the form of}} charcoal) in a crucible, was {{produced}} in Merv by the 9th to 10th century AD. In the 11th century, there is evidence of the production of steel in Song China using two techniques: a [...] "berganesque" [...] method that produced inferior, inhomogeneous, steel, and a precursor to the modern Bessemer process that used partial decarbonization via repeated forging under a cold blast.|$|E

40|$|The uptake of iron by molten {{magnesium}} from uncoated new mild <b>steel</b> <b>crucibles</b> {{at temperatures}} 680 °C, 730 °C, and 780 °C has been investigated. It was {{shown that the}} uptake of iron was sluggish at 680 °C {{and the use of}} 0. 05 % zirconium addition could effectively suppress the increase in iron content within the first 2 h of holding at temperature. Rapid and severe uptake of iron was observed at 780 °C. As a consequence, {{it was found that the}} grain refinement of pure magnesium achieved by 1 % zirconium addition nearly vanished after 60 min hold at 780 °C due to the depletion of soluble zirconium. The uptake of iron at 730 °C was conspicuous but it was still controllable by use of 0. 05 % zirconium addition within the first 60 min of holding at temperature. The work conducted using an aluminium titanite crucible and a boron nitride coated mild <b>steel</b> <b>crucible</b> at 730 °C further confirmed the highly detrimental influence of the uptake of iron on the grain refinement of pure magnesium by zirconium. The characteristic zirconium rich coring structures developed from circular to rosette like when the melt was held at 730 °C in an uncoated mild <b>steel</b> <b>crucible,</b> while no such evolution was observed when held in an aluminium titanite crucible at the same temperature. Recommendations to minimise the consumption of zirconium by the uptake of iron were made based on the results obtained from this investigation. The mechanism of grain refinement of magnesium by a low concentration of zirconium is discussed...|$|R
