General practitioners and pediatric dentists from different areas in Riyadh were requested to complete these questionnaires. results: A total of 250 questionnaires had been used for collecting the data and % 95) 236) were returned after completion. It was found that, two hundred twelve (% 89. 5) of respondents were general practitioners and twenty-five (% 10. 5) were pediatric dentists. The result of this study indicated that about % 50 of the dentists did not use or rarely used stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns</b> in their clinics and more than % 50 of them do not take x-rays for the teeth before and after treatment. More than two- thirds (% 70) of the sample recommended restoring primary teeth with stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns</b> after pulp therapy.

40|$|Background and Aim: The {{need for}} recrimping precrimped {{stainless}} <b>steel</b> <b>crowns</b> by the dentist in clinic is controversial. This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} rate of marginal circumference and marginal thickness change of precrimped stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns</b> after recrimping. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 30 primary photos were taken from margins of 30 S. S. Cs (3 M, Ni-Cr) related to tooth 85 with a digital camera fixed at a determined distance. Margins of crowns were crimped by 114 and 137 pliers with a controlled force (0. 2 N) and then 30 secondary photos were taken in the same conditions. The circumference of crown margins in primary (group A) and secondary (group B) photos were assessed by a digitizer system. Comparing the circumferences of crown margins in primary and secondary photos showed a significant decrease after crimping. Thickness of 30 random points on the crown margins of a crown similar to mentioned cases was measured by SEM (× 150). Then similar procedures including taking a primary photo, crimping and taking a secondary photo was done for the sample crown. After significant reduction in margin circumference, thickness of 30 other random points on the crown margin were measured by SEM. Data were analyzed by paired sample t-test with p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: The mean marginal circumference of precrimped stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns</b> was reduced by 7. 3 % which was significant (P< 0. 001).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Purpose: To {{compile a}} survey of the {{longevity}} and reasons for failure of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns,</b> amalgam, glass-ionomer, composite and compomer restorations in stress-bearing cavities of primary molars. Methods: This work reviewed the dental literature of 1971 up to July 2003 for longitudinal, controlled clinical studies and retrospective cross-sectional studies. Only studies investigating the clinical performance of restorations in primary teeth with an observation period of at least 2 years were included. Annual failure rates of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns,</b> amalgam, glass-ionomer, composite and compomer restorations were determined and failure reasons were discussed. Results: Annual failure rates in stress-bearing cavities of primary molars were determined to be: 0 - 14 % for stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns,</b> 0 - 35. 3 % for amalgam restorations, 0 - 25. 8 % for glass-ionomer restorations, 2 - 29. 1 % for atraumatic restorative treatments, 0 - 15 % for composite restorations, and 0 - 11 for compomer restorations. Main reasons for failure were secondary caries, marginal deficiencies, fracture, and wear. (Am J Dent 2005; 18 : 198 - 211).

40|$|Purpose: This {{in vitro}} study was {{conducted}} to find out the effect of retentive groove, sand blasting and cement type on the retentive strength of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns</b> in primary second molars. Materials and Methods: Thirty-two extracted intact human maxillary and mandibular primary second molars were embedded in aluminum blocks utilizing autopolymerising acrylic resin. After tooth preparation, the 3 M stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crown</b> was adjusted to the prepared tooth. Then weldable buccal tubes were welded on the buccal and lingual surfaces of each crown as an attachment for the testing machine. A full factorial design matrix for four factors (retentive groove placement on the tooth, cement type, sandblasting and primary second molar) at two levels each was developed and the {{study was conducted}} as dictated by the matrix. The lower and upper limits for each factor were without and with retentive groove placement on the tooth, GIC and RMGIC, without and with sandblasting of crown, maxillary and mandibular second primary molar. For those teeth for which the design matrix dictated groove placement, the retentive groove was placed on the middle third of the buccal surface of the tooth horizontally and for those crowns for which sandblasting of the crowns are to be done, sandblasting was done with aluminium oxide with a particle size of 250 mm. The crowns were luted with either GIC or RMGIC, as dictated by the design matrix. Then the retentive strength of each sample was evaluated by means of an universal testing machine. The obtained data was analyzed using ANOVA for statistical analysis of the data and ′t′- tests for pairwise comparison. Results: The mean retentive strength in kg/cm 2 stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns</b> luted with RMGIC was 19. 361 and the mean retentive strength of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns</b> luted with GIC was 15. 964 kg/cm 2 with a mean difference of 3. 397 kg/cm 2 and was statistically significant. The mean retentive strength in kg/cm 2 of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns,</b> which was not sandblasted, was 18. 880 and which was sandblasted was 16. 445 kg/cm 2 with a mean difference of 2. 436 kg/cm 2. These results were again statistically significant. Conclusion: It was found that the crowns luted with resin-modified glass ionomer cements (RMGIC′s) offered better retentive strength of crowns than glass ionomer cements (GIC) and stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns</b> which were cemented without sandblasting showed higher mean retentive strength than with sandblasting of crowns.

Veneer primary molar esthetic stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns</b> have recently appeared on the market. There are few literatures on the performances of these crowns but none compare the different brands from different companies. Methods. Ten of the same sized preveneered primary molar stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns</b> will be purchase from four different laboratories. The four laboratories will be tested are: Dental Innovators, Cheng Crowns, NuSmile Crowns, Kinder Krowns. Only full porcelain coverage primary molar stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns</b> will be used.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate whether stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns</b> show significant susceptibility artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and whether these artifacts make it necessary to remove these crowns before an MRI examination. Furthermore, this study analyzes whether different commercially available crowns, which vary in their composition, cause different artifact intensity levels in MRI and whether a shortening and bending of the crown margin leads to more extensive artifacts. In addition, this study evaluates to what extent a change in the magnetic field strength from 1. 5 to 3. 0 Tesla causes an increase in artifact sizes. Results: In general, stainless <b>steel</b> <b>crowns</b> {{do not have to be}} removed before an MRI examination. Areas within a close distance from the crown can however be affected by artifacts.

The GCF samples were quantified by ELISA and the levels of MIP- 1 α and MIP- 1 β were determined. Results: MIP- 1 α and MIP- 1 β were detected in all the samples. Highest mean concentration in GCF was obtained for Group 3 followed by Groups 2 and 4 while the lowest concentration was seen in Group 1. This suggests that MIP- 1 α and MIP- 1 β levels in GCF increased proportionately with the inflammation. Conclusions: GCF serves as a noninvasive diagnostic fluid to measure biomarkers released during dental caries initiation and progression.
