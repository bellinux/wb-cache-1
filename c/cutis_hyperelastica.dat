40|$|A {{rare case}} of cutis laxa is presented. Cutis I= enjoys more {{popularity}} {{as compared to}} other synonyms; though dermatomegaly or generalised elastosis is appropriate. Cutis laxa is a specific entity and must be differentiated from <b>cutis</b> <b>hyperelastica</b> and neurofibromatosis. Whether the disease is congenital or acquired it involves the connective tissue throughout the body. In {{view of the fact}} that the mother developed spontaneous pneumothorax it would be debatable to conclude whether our patient has a congenital or acquired variety of cutis laxa. Authors have postulated a hypothesis towards the relation of cause and effect of cutis laxa to enteric fever...|$|E
40|$|Resumo: A sÃ­ndroma de Ehlers-Danlos (<b>cutis</b> <b>hyperelastica),</b> constitui uma patologia do tecido conjuntivo caracterizada por alteraÃ§Ãµes da pele, ligamentos e Ã³rgÃ£os internos. Apresenta transmissÃ£o hereditÃ¡ria, em geral autossÃ³mica dominante. Afecta primordialmente a sÃ­ntese do colagÃ©neo, pelo que a pele e os vasos sanguÃ­neos se tornam extremamente elÃ¡sticos e frÃ¡geis. A pele Ã© macia, com consistÃªncia de borracha, e as equimoses surgem facilmente. As articulaÃ§Ãµes sÃ£o hiperextensÃ­veis e tÃªm mobilidade aumentada. Os autores apresentam o caso clÃ­nico de um doente de dezasseis anos, com histÃ³ria de hipermobilidade {{articular}} desde a infÃ¢ncia e fractura esplÃ©nica, a quem foi feito o diagnÃ³stico de sÃ­ndroma de Ehlers-Danlos na sequÃªncia de pneumotÃ³rax espontÃ¢neo recidivante. Apresentam-se as complicaÃ§Ãµes pulmonares mais frequentes desta sÃ­ndroma e discute-se a importÃ¢ncia de nÃ£o esquecer as etiologias menos comuns, perante casos de pneumotÃ³rax espontÃ¢neo. Rev Port Pneumol 2006; XII (4) : 471 - 480 Abstract: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (<b>cutis</b> <b>hyperelastica),</b> is a {{group of}} connective tissue disorders characterized by abnormalities of the skin, ligaments and internal organs. It is a hereditary syndrome, usually with autossomal dominant inheritance; that primarily affects the collagen synthesis. The skin and blood vessels are extremely fragile and elastic. The skin is soft with rubber consistency and easily bruising. There are hypermobile joints with increased extensibility. We summarize the case of a sixteen year old boy with a history of joint hypermobility since childhood and splenic fracture that was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome after the occurrence of recidivant spontaneous pneumothorax. We present the most common pulmonary complications of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and discuss the importance of not forgetting the least commons etiologies of pneumothorax, in cases of spontaneous pneumothorax.

40|$|The authors had the {{opportunity}} to observe some patients with congemnital flaccidity of the joints-a climiical entity that has been largely ignored in orthopaedic literature. The interest of the semiior author imi the subject was stimulated in 1951, when, upon studying a group of patients with atypical congenital dislocations of the hip, he found one, in contrast to the rigidity observed mi the arthrogrypotic type, who exhibited bilateral congenital dislocation associated with a general hyperlaxity of most of the other joints. The term arthrochalasis multiplex corrgenita was suggested since this sums up the leading clinical characteristics of the condition, namely, multiple articular flaccidity of con-genital origimi. Upomi reviewing the literature, one is astonished to find how little attention has been given to the orthopaedic aspects of this interesting entity. Nearly all reports have dealt principally with hyperelasticity of the skimi, cutis laxa or <b>cutis</b> <b>hyperelastica.</b> The coimicidental presence of hyperlaxity of the joints was considered only one manifestation of a general anomaly of the elastic tissue.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Skin malformations {{that resembled}} manifestations of Ehlers-Danlos-Syndrome were {{described}} {{in a variety of}} domestic animals during the last century as <b>cutis</b> <b>hyperelastica,</b> hyperelastosis cutis, dermatosparaxis, dermal/collagen dysplasia, dermal/cutaneous asthenia or Ehlers-Danlos-like syndrome/s. In 2007, the mutation responsible for Hereditary Equine Regional Dermal Asthenia (HERDA) in Quarter Horses was discovered. Several case reports are available for similar malformations in other breeds than Quarter Horses (Draught Horses, Arabians, and Thoroughbreds) including four case reports for Warmblood horses. Since 2013, a genetic test for the Warmblood Fragile Foal Syndrome Type 1 (WFFS), interrogating the causative point mutation in the equine procollagen-lysine, 2 -oxoglutarate 5 -dioxygenase 1 (PLOD 1, or lysyl hydroxylase 1) gene, has become available. Only limited data are available on the occurrence rate and clinical characteristics of this newly detected genetic disease in horses. In humans mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Type VI (kyphoscoliotic form). CASE PRESENTATION: This is the first report describing the clinical and histopathological findings in a foal confirmed to be homozygous positive for WFFS. The Warmblood filly was born with very thin, friable skin, skin lesions on the legs and the head, and an open abdomen. These abnormalities required euthanasia just after delivery. Histologic examination revealed abnormally thin dermis, markedly reduced amounts of dermal collagen bundles, with loosely orientation and abnormally large spaces between deep dermal fibers. CONCLUSION: WFFS is a novel genetic disease in horses and should be considered in cases of abortion, stillbirth, skin lesions and malformations of the skin in neonatal foals. Genetic testing of suspicious cases will contribute to evaluate the frequency of occurrence of clinical WFFS cases and its relevance for the horse population...|$|E
