[...] Musician Steve Earle, who met him in 1978 and considered Van Zandt a mentor, once called Van Zandt [...] "the best songwriter in the whole world and I'll stand on Bob Dylan's <b>coffee</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> my cowboy boots and say that." [...] The quote was printed on a sticker featured on the packing of At My Window, much to Van Zandt's displeasure. In the years following, the quote was often cited by the press, much to Van Zandt and Earle's embarrassment; in 2009, Earle told the New York Times, [...] "Did I ever believe that Townes was better than Bob Dylan? No." [...] But he later concluded {{at the end of the}} same article that, [...] "As a songwriter, you won't find anybody better." [...] Earle has championed the songwriter on a number of occasions: his eldest son, Justin Townes Earle, also a musician, is named after Van Zandt. Earle wrote the song [...] "Fort Worth Blues" [...] as a tribute to the singer in the late 1990s, and in 2009 released an album titled Townes, which featured all covers of Van Zandt songs.|$|E
