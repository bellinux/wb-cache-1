5000|$|A cyborg (<b>cybernetic</b> <b>organism)</b> {{is a term}} {{referring}} to individuals with [...] "both biological and artificial parts." [...] Cyborgs are known as being half-human, half machine organisms, {{due to the fact}} that they are always connected with technology. This term, which was coined in 1960 by Manfred Clynes, refers to and acknowledges those beings whose abilities have been enhanced due to the presence and advancement of technology. The notion of cyborg has played a part in breaking down boundaries between humans and non-humans living within a technologically advanced society. For example, those who have installed pacemakers, hearing aids, artificial body parts, cochlear implants as well as other technologies that may aid in enhancing an organisms abilities and capacities to perform, either physically or mentally.Hugh Herr, an American rock climber, engineer, and biophysicist, has successfully invented the next generation of cyborg (bionic limbs and robotic prosthetics). As the head of the Media Lab's Biomechatronics group in MIT, he shared his experience and presented the team achievement first time in a TED talk show.|$|E
5000|$|The {{object of}} study for cyborg {{anthropology}} is the cyborg. Originally coined in a 1960 paper about space exploration, {{the term is}} short for <b>cybernetic</b> <b>organism.</b> A cyborg is traditionally defined as a system with both organic and inorganic parts. In the narrowest sense of the word, cyborgs are people with machinated body parts. These cyborg parts may be restorative technologies that help a body function where the organic system has failed, like pacemakers, insulin pumps, and bionic limbs, or enhanced technologies that improve the human body beyond its natural state. In the broadest sense, all human interactions with technology could qualify as a cyborg. Most cyborg anthropologists lean towards the latter view of the cyborg; some, like Amber Case, even claim that humans are already cyborgs because people's daily life and sense of self is so intertwined with technology. Haraway's [...] "Cyborg Manifesto" [...] suggests that technology like virtual avatars, artificial insemination, sexual reassignment surgery, and artificial intelligence might make dichotomies of sex and gender irrelevant, even nonexistent. She {{goes on to say}} that other human distinctions (like life and death, human and machine, virtual and real) may similarly disappear in the wake of the cyborg.|$|E
5000|$|Brainiac 5 {{appears in}} Legion of Super Heroes, voiced by Adam Wylie. He is {{a core member}} of the Legion of Super Heroes. This version is Coluan, a nano-based <b>cybernetic</b> <b>organism</b> that not only {{possesses}} 12th-level intelligence, but can assume a human-like form. His human-like form can also alter its shape to create tools and weapons or transform into a large, battle robot form, much like the reboot Legion member, Gear. His AI core {{is based on the}} original Brainiac 1.0 from whom he tries to distance himself as best as possible. Unlike many versions where he is portrayed as cold and unfeeling, this version is considerably more emotional. In the first season, he often appears eager to prove himself to his older teammates, particularly the original Superman; Brainiac 5, unlike his villainous ancestor, idolizes Superman. However, his high intellect and his emotional nature often cause him internal conflict; for example, he idolizes Superman, but knows intellectually that he cannot reveal many of the things he knows lie in the future for Superman once he is returned to his own time, as Superman's knowledge of 'future' events could change what is, for the Legion, history. In the second season episodes [...] "Chained Lightning" [...] and [...] "Message in a Bottle", Brainiac 5 grows close to Shrinking Violet; however, as the series ended it remains unknown if this was an intended romance or not. He seems to have feelings for Superman himself, because of the simulation he produced that involved him and Superman shown at the premiere of season two and many other incidents in the series. In the second-season premiere, Superman X (a clone of Superman from the 41st century) hints that someday Brainiac 5 will be responsible for something terrible in the future. The starting phase occurs in [...] "Message in a Bottle", when Brainiac 5 was forced to tap into the data of Brainiac who had been observing Brainiac 5 since he came online. Brainiac 5 travels within himself to meet with his ancestor, where he is offered data from the original Brainiac. Brainiac 5 forcefully accepts the 'gift' of data he needed to stop Imperiex from his ancestor who hinted it to 'open new avenues of possibilities'. Soon after using the info he obtained to save Kandor and restore it to original size, Brainiac 5 begins to suffer data corruption as Imperiex intended from the start, becoming cold and unfeeling in the process. Once completely under his ancestor's influence during the [...] "Dark Victory" [...] series finale, Brainiac 5 assumes a new form in homage to his ancestor and leaves the Legion to join Imperiex's army, taking command after killing Imperiex. Once overpowering the hivemind on his homeworld of Colu with his will, Brainiac 5 intends to bring [...] "order" [...] to the universe, destroying any who interfere. Thanks to Superman and Superman X, Brainiac 5 managed to regain control over himself and overpower his ancestor. In the process, Brainiac 5 becomes a pure organic being as he discards his robotic armor. To cope with this new state and his recent actions, Brainiac 5 leaves the Legion. The robotic parts, in turn, combine to form a new evil Brainiac, leaving the series with a cliffhanger, which was intended to finish until the show was canceled.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} contemporary technology on representations {{of the human body}} in American popular culture, focusing on James Cameron’s science fiction films The Terminator (1984) and The Terminator II - Judgment Day (1991) in both of which the key figures are <b>cybernetic</b> <b>organisms</b> (cyborgs) or a robot which can exactly imitate the human form. The paper argues that the ability of modern film technology’ to represent the human form in robotic guise undercuts the distinction between nature and culture which maintains the position of the human being in society. The ability of the robot or cyborg to be ‘polygendered’ in particular, undermines the position of a properly oedipalized human body in society, one which balances the instinctual life against the rule of cultural law. As a result the second Terminator film attempts a recuperation of the category of the human by an oedipalization of the terminator cyborg...|$|R

40|$|By {{using the}} cyborg as a {{structural}} tool to analyze {{certain aspects of}} human interaction with what can be perceived as landscape or landscape architectural elements, this thesis seeks to explore {{the concept of the}} cyborg landscape in order to place human practice in the context of postmodern ideas of the end of true nature. Ever since human kind has externalized evo-lution by using tools and extending the body with technological inventions, we have also taken our surroundings out of their natural trajectory. Everything we do that is conditioned by the use of technology is altering that which we perceive as nature and natural. Since we have been doing this for millennia we have of course also altered our surroundings by the influence of technology. This thesis uses three examples of landscape or landscape architectural elements that are conditioned by the integration of technology to explore this practice through a postmodern model of analysis based on the concept and basic premises of the cyborg, or the <b>cybernetic</b> <b>organism.</b> A <b>cybernetic</b> <b>organism</b> is in short an organism that has functioning technological parts integrated into its system. By way of popular culture this idea has been given a set of basic rules and an identity, which has transformed into a theoretical way of approaching phenomena in our reality. The three examples that are the basis for this thesis are in order or scale: artificially illumi-nated vegetation, vertical hydroponics with integrated greywater treatment and technolo-gized agriculture. The thesis seeks to find the inherent strengths and weaknesses within these examples to try and find whether or not there could be any common factors that unite these examples. The conclusion is that even though the examples show a great amount of strengths and weaknesses that are attributed to their technologization, all cyborg landscapes are so different in their basic nature that merely one strength and one weakness are a com-mon factor among them. All cyborg landscapes can offer humanity something that they could never do without the integration of technology and without the meddling of the human hand they would all in different ways be terminated...|$|E

40|$|Through The NTNU Cyborg initiative, a <b>cybernetic</b> (bio-robotic) <b>organism</b> is {{currently}} under development. Using neural tissue, cultured on a microelectrode array (MEA), {{the goal is}} to use in-vitro biological neurons to control a robotic platform. This thesis forms the basis for this development, and serves as the preliminary for a further Phd involving the same topics. Investigation into the the necessary aspects of embodying a neuronal culture though a robotic platform has been conducted. Building upon similar embodied research, as well as knowledge from the fields of neuroscience and computer science, the necessary components for building such a system are discussed. Beginning with the more practical issues, the MEA 2100 - 60 -System for communicating with the neuronal culture was presented, along with a proposed infrastructure for distributing the MEA-Cyborg system across the three main participating departments: The Department of Engineering Cybernetics (ITK), the Department of Neuroscience (INM), and the Department of Computer and Information Science (IDI). Robotic bodies, for embodying the culture, have also been introduced; from Animats and Hybrots to The NTNU Cyborg robot platform. We have further looked at encoding information to the culture through stimulation, and decoding information from the culture through analyzing the MEA recordings. Through stimulation and recording we propose to 'close the loop' by feeding sensory data from the robot platform to the neuronal culture, and using the culture recordings as robotic instructions. Training a neuronal culture {{is one of the more}} challenging tasks within The NTNU Cyborg project. With inspiration from biology and artificial neural networks (ANNs), we have looked at some mechanisms for training neuronal cultures though supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement type training. For the sake of completion, a brief discussion on some aspects of modeling a neuronal culture has been included. We have discussed how a realistic model may be constructed and the benefits of doing so. Finally, putting together the topics discussed in this thesis, a plan moving forward has been suggested for when the MEA is up and running...|$|R
40|$|In “An Evolutionary Architecture”, John Frazer {{presents}} {{an overview of}} his work for the past 30 years. Attempting to develop a theoretical basis for architecture using analogies with nature's processes of evolution and morphogenesis. Frazer's {{vision of the future}} of architecture is to construct organic buildings. Thermodynamically open systems which are more environmentally aware and sustainable physically, sociologically and economically. The range of topics which Frazer discusses is a good illustration of the breadth and depth of the evolutionary design problem. Environmental Modelling One of the first topics dealt with is the importance of environmental modelling within the design process. Frazer shows how environmental modelling is often misused or misinterpreted by architects with particular reference to solar modelling. From the discussion given it would seem that simplifications of the environmental models is the prime culprit resulting in misinterpretation and misuse. The simplifications are understandable given the amount of information needed for accurate modelling. By simplifying the model of the environmental conditions the architect is able to make informed judgments within reasonable amounts of time and effort. Unfortunately the simplications result in errors which compound and cause the resulting structures to fall short of their anticipated performance. Frazer obviously believes that the computer can be a great aid in the harnessing of environmental modelling data, providing that the same simplifying assumptions are not made and that better models and interfaces are possible. Physical Modelling Physical modelling has {{played an important role in}} Frazer's research. Leading to the construction of several novel machine readable interactive models, ranging from lego-like building blocks to beermat cellular automata and wall partitioning systems. Ultimately this line of research has led to the Universal Constructor and the Universal Interactor. The Universal Constructor The Universal Constructor features on the cover of the book. It consists of a base plug-board, called the “landscapei, on top of which “smart” blocks, or cells, can be stacked vertically. The cells are individually identified and can communicate with neighbours above and below. Cells communicate with users through a bank of LEDs displaying the current state of the cell. The whole structure is machine readable and so can be interpreted by a computer. The computer can interpret the states of the cells as either colour or geometrical transformations allowing a wide range of possible interpretations. The user interacts with the computer display through direct manipulation of the cells. The computer can communicate and even direct the actions of the user through feedback with the cells to display various states. The direct manipulation of the cells encourages experimentation by the user and demonstrates basic concepts of the system. The Universal Interactor The Universal Interactor is a whole series of experimental projects investigating novel input and output devices. All of the devices speak a common binary language and so can communicate through a mediating central hub. The result is that input, from say a body-suit, can be used to drive the out of a sound system or vice versa. The Universal Interactor opens up many possibilities for expression when using a CAD system that may at first seem very strange. However, some of these feedback systems may prove superior in the hands of skilled technicians than more standard devices. Imagine how a musician might be able to devise structures by playing melodies which express the character. Of course the interpretation of input in this form poses a difficult problem which will take a great deal of research to achieve. The Universal Interactor has been used to provide environmental feedback to affect the development of evolving genetic codes. The feedback given by the Universal Interactor has been used to guide selection of individuals from a population. Adaptive Computing Frazer completes his introduction to the range of tools used in his research by giving a brief tour of adaptive computing techniques. Covering topics including cellular automata, genetic algorithms, classifier systems and artificial evolution. Cellular Automata As previously mentioned Frazer has done some work using cellular automata in both physical and simulated environments. Frazer discusses how surprisingly complex behaviour can result from the simple local rules executed by cellular automata. Cellular automata are also capable of computation, in fact able to perform any computation possible by a finite state machine. Note that this does not mean that cellular automata are capable of any general computation as this would require the construction of a Turing machine which is beyond the capabilities of a finite state machine. Genetic Algorithms Genetic algorithms were first presented by Holland and since have become a important tool for many researchers in various areas. Originally developed for problem-solving and optimization problems with clearly stated criteria and goals. Frazer fails to mention one of the most important differences between genetic algorithms and other adaptive problem-solving techniques, ie. neural networks. Genetic algorithms have the advantage that criteria can be clearly stated and controlled within the fitness function. The learning by example which neural networks rely upon does not afford this level of control over what is to be learned. Classifier Systems Holland went on to develop genetic algorithms into classifier systems. Classifier systems are more focussed upon the problem of learning appropriate responses to stimuli, than searching for solutions to problems. Classifier systems receive information from the environment and respond according to rules, or classifiers. Successful classifiers are rewarded, creating a reinforcement learning environment. Obviously, the mapping between classifier systems and the <b>cybernetic</b> view of <b>organisms</b> sensing, processing and responding to environmental stimuli is strong. It would seem that a central process similar to a classifier system would be appropriate at the core of an organic building. Learning appropriate responses to environmental conditions over time. Artificial Evolution Artificial evolution traces it's roots back to the Biomorph program which was described by Dawkins in his book “The Blind Watchmaker”. Essentially, artificial evolution requires that a user supplements the standard fitness function in genetic algorithms to guide evolution. The user may provide selection pressures which are unquantifiable in a stated problem and thus provide a means for dealing ill-defined criteria. Frazer notes that solving problems with ill-defined criteria using artificial evolution seriously limits the scope of problems that can be tackled. The reliance upon user interaction in artificial evolution reduces the practical size of populations and the duration of evolutionary runs. Coding Schemes Frazer goes on to discuss the encoding of architectural designs and their subsequent evolution. Introducing two major systems, the Reptile system and the Universal State Space Modeller. Blueprint vs. Recipe Frazer points out the inadequacies of using standard “blueprinti design techniques in developing organic structures. Using a “recipe” describe the process of constructing a building is presented as an alternative. Recipes for construction are discussed with reference to the analogous process description given by DNA to construct an organism. The Reptile System The Reptile System is an ingenious construction set capable of producing a wide range of structures using just two simple components. Frazer saw the advantages of this system for rule-based and evolutionary systems in the compactness of structure descriptions. Compactness was essential for the early computational work when computer memory and storage space was scarce. However, compact representations such as those described form very rugged fitness landscapes which are not well suited to evolutionary search techniques. Structures are created from an initial “seed” or minimal construction, for example a compact spherical structure. The seed is then manipulated using a series of processes or transformations, for example stretching, shearing or bending. The structure would grow according to the transformations applied to it. Obviously, the transformations could be a predetermined sequence of actions which would always yield the same final structure given the same initial seed. Alternatively, the series of transformations applied could be environmentally sensitive resulting in forms which were also sensitive to their location. The idea of taking a geometrical form as a seed and transforming it using a series of processes to create complex structures is similar in many ways to the early work of Latham creating large morphological charts. Latham went on to develop his ideas into the “Mutatori system which he used to create organic artworks. Generalising the Reptile System Frazer has proposed a generalised version of the Reptile System to tackle more realistic building problems. Generating the seed or minimal configuration from design requirements automatically. From this starting point (or set of starting points) solutions could be evolved using artificial evolution. Quantifiable and specific aspects of the design brief define the formal criteria which are used as a standard fitness function. Non-quantifiable criteria, including aesthetic judgments, are evaluated by the user. The proposed system would be able to learn successful strategies for satisfying both formal and user criteria. In doing so the system would become a personalised tool of the designer. A personal assistant which would be able to anticipate aesthetic judgements and other criteria by employing previously successful strategies. Ultimately, this is a|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the history of the human‐machine hybrid called cyborg, and its various connotations within the {{scientific}} world, throughout the second half of the Twentieth century. The first part recalls the origin of the term “cyborg”, invented as a contraction of <b>cybernetic</b> <b>organism</b> by Clynes and Kline, two scientists working for the NASA space program in 1960. Instead of creating earth‐like environments for the astronauts to live in, the authors propose to modify human biology in order to fit alien environments, giving the name cyborg to this hypothetical astronaut. The second half of the paper deals with the consequences of the technological and biotechnological revolutions, during the 80 s and the 90 s, in reference to the epistemological shift investing the human‐technology interactions. The debate about human enhancement, fueled by the advances in the biotechnological field, is dominated by two opposite sides: bioconservatives against transhumanists, both underlining the utter separation and opposition between human nature and technology. The cyborg, on the contrary, marks the merging between flesh and artifice; the paper tries to explore the possibilities suggested by the cyborg model, towards the fall of traditional ontological boundaries between human and non‐human entities, and a happy hybridization...|$|E

We consider two different takes on this issue: women as technology and technology as women, and we start with the successive versions of Stepford Wives (the novel, the 1975 movie and the 2004 movie), and continue by tracing the evolution of the character of a cyberwoman, from William Gibson’s Neuromancer (1984) and Idoru (1996), to Trinity from the Matrix trilogy. We show that cyborgization does not automatically denote liberalization, and suggest that the much greater popularity of the Matrix fi lms compared to the intellectual projects of William Gibson means that stereotypes and strong plots survive, fi nding ever new forms of expression. We end the paper by pointing out the relevance of popular culture models for work in contemporary homes and other workplaces.

The cyborg is a matter of fi ction and lived experience that changes what counts as women’s experience in the late 20 th century. This is a struggle over life and death, but the boundary between science fi ction and social reality is an optical illusion. Contemporary science fi ction is full of cyborgs—creature...|$|E
