5|$|A solar <b>chimney</b> (or thermal <b>chimney,</b> in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the <b>chimney</b> warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials {{in a way that}} mimics greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|Dibnah {{had watched}} the {{activities}} of steeplejacks throughout his childhood, and witnessed his first <b>chimney</b> felling from his father's allotment near Bolton's greyhound track at Raikes Park. The steeplejacks first removed {{the top of the}} <b>chimney</b> and then created a hole in its base, propped with blocks of wood. They then lit a fire, destroying the supports and causing the <b>chimney</b> to collapse. Unfortunately, on this occasion the <b>chimney</b> fell in the wrong direction, onto the greyhound track's dog kennels, a local cafe and a series of power cables.|$|E
5|$|The Solar updraft tower (SUT) is a renewable-energy {{power plant}} for {{generating}} electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath {{a very wide}} greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall <b>chimney</b> tower. The resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the <b>chimney</b> effect. This airflow drives wind turbines placed in the <b>chimney</b> updraft or around the <b>chimney</b> base to produce electricity. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.|$|E

5|$|Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was {{building}} the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion {{was once again}} plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental <b>chimney</b> piece sculpted by Richard Westmacott. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a <b>chimney</b> piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese <b>chimney</b> piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.|$|E
5|$|Smoke-lifting {{devices were}} not a {{priority}} with the normal single-chimney Pacifics. However, with its double <b>chimney</b> and subsequent fitting of a double Kylchap exhaust in 1937, Humorist continued to pose a problem in this regard and always had small wings {{on either side of}} the <b>chimney.</b> Finally, in the 1950s, it acquired the Peppercorn-type of deflector plates.|$|E

5|$|Those {{tending the}} {{furnaces}} were {{unaware that the}} heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of the flues and started a <b>chimney</b> fire. With the doors of the furnaces open, more oxygen was drawn into the furnaces, which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven further up the flues than they should have been. The flues had been weakened over time by having footholds cut in them by the child <b>chimney</b> sweeps. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the cleaning, the fabric of the <b>chimney</b> was still weakened by the action. In October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of clinker had built up inside the flues.|$|E
5|$|Wings for My Flight: The Peregrine Falcons of <b>Chimney</b> Rock is a 1991 book by American {{wildlife}} biologist Marcy Cottrell Houle. Wings for My Flight documents Houle's observations {{of a pair}} of the then-endangered peregrine falcons at <b>Chimney</b> Rock, a prominent rock formation in Colorado, while employed by the Colorado Division of Wildlife in the summer of 1975. To protect the falcons, Houle had to halt a million-dollar project to turn ancient Anasazi ruins in the area into a tourist attraction and faced opposition and harassment by the <b>Chimney</b> Rock community as a result. The community eventually showed concern for Houle, however, after her trailer was broken into and vandalized.|$|E
5|$|Abel Starkey was {{a native}} of Roxbury, Massachusetts. The story of Starkey's capture was {{published}} by George Hubbard in The New England Magazine. Starkey was part of a gang of counterfeiters, including Stephen Burroughs, Samuel Corson and James Smith. Pursued by the authorities, Abel Starkey disappeared in the vicinity of a lightning splitter home that was owned by the Shephardson family. A thorough search of the house was conducted and the authorities found nothing. According to Hubbard, the house was the refuge of the counterfeiters for a number of years. After a time the public and authorities continued to track members of the gang to the location and investigations were performed only to turn up empty. Sheriff Johnson of Worcester tracked the counterfeiters to the house one day and set up a team of men outside and inside the house to uncover and arrest the counterfeiters. A careful search turned up nothing, so measurements of the house were taken to make sure no secret rooms or areas existed. With the inaccessible third attic all but ruled out, the discovery of its access through the <b>chimney</b> was by chance when an officer emptied out his trash into the fireplace. Contained in the trash was some snuff and a sneeze came from above, alerting the officers of hidden occupants in the <b>chimney.</b> After the fire had been extinguished and raked out, Sheriff Johnson attempted to climb up into the <b>chimney.</b> A brick was dropped from above and wounded him. The authorities capped the <b>chimney</b> and smoked the counterfeiters until they fell unconscious. Starkey was amongst the three arrested counterfeiters.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} most Maunsell designs, the Q class {{locomotives}} were reliable, {{but there were}} complaints of poor steaming when used on main-line trains (for which they were never designed). In 1940 Bulleid fitted {{one member of the}} class with a Lemaître blast pipe in an attempt to improve their efficiency. This proved to be successful and the remainder of the class were so fitted between 1946 and 1949. During the 1950s further experiments were carried out by the fitting of a British Railways Standard Class 4 plain blast pipe and small stovepipe <b>chimney</b> to no. 30549 in 1955, resulting in further improvements in both steaming and fuel consumption; in 1958–61, six more received the same blast pipe with a BR Standard Class 4 <b>chimney.</b>|$|E
5|$|The five-bay front facade has two flat Doric pilasters and {{two more}} pilasters, located off the central bay support the broken base pediment. The {{original}} door was replaced with a 19th-century door that has a 20-pane fanlight and is flanked by two flat pilasters that support the broken base pediment over the door. The main house originally had two-chimney design and another <b>chimney</b> {{was added to the}} east wall for a 20th-century furnace. Most of the windows in the house were replaced in the 19th century with 2-over-2 sash, except for two attic windows of each end of the gable which retain the smaller paned sashes. The house includes an earlier -story ell in the rear that {{appears to have been a}} two-room central <b>chimney</b> structure that was integrated into the design of the main house and built in the second quarter of the 18th century. The <b>chimney</b> was replaced in the 19th century. A storage shed also sits behind the house.

There is a three-story rectangular brick tower set into the main (west) facade. The tower is open at the top beneath a wide wood fascia. The building has a brick <b>chimney</b> decorated with corbelling; its <b>chimney</b> coping and caps are made of concrete. The building is now rented to the members.|$|E

50|$|Originally 'A' Station {{had four}} cast iron <b>chimneys</b> {{but these were}} {{replaced}} by two brick built stacks, each 275 feet high. The later 'B' and 'C' stations each had two brick <b>chimneys</b> of 325 feet high. When completed the adjoining boiler houses totalled 255 yards and the entire buildings and <b>chimneys</b> used several million bricks. It is estimated that the six <b>chimneys</b> alone used at least 8 million bricks. By 1937 the station supplied a maximum load of 101,800 kW of electricity.|$|R
500|$|Single <b>chimneys</b> were {{fitted to}} Nos. 6220–6234 when built.
