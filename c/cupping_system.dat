40|$|We {{assessed}} the clinical and radiographic results of 40 porous-coated acetabular cups with an Acetabular <b>Cup</b> <b>System</b> polyethylene liner over a minimum 14 -year follow-up. Femoral head penetration was estimated using a software package. Fifteen cups were revised, 11 due to polyethylene liner rupture.

The overall femoral head penetration rate in hips without liner fracture {{with reference to}} the early penetration point was 0. 1188 ± 0. 070  mm per year. Polyethylene liner fractures were associated with higher early femoral head penetration (P< 0. 0001) and a vertical cup position (P= 0. 0016). The 14 -year survival without cup revision for any reason was 63. 9 %, 71. 8 % with no ACS polyethylene liner fracture and 65. 3 % with no acetabular osteolysis. Most cups showed a good clinical outcome in general, but major Acetabular <b>Cup</b> <b>System</b> liner failure and osteolysis were frequent.
