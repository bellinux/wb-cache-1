40|$|This paper {{presents}} an indirect matrix converter (IMC) topology for {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (HEV) application with three-phase and single-phase outputs. The HEV includes mechanical, electrical, control, and electrochemical systems among others. In the mechanical system, a traction <b>motor</b> and a <b>compressor</b> <b>motor</b> are used to drive the HEV. The traction <b>motor</b> and the <b>compressor</b> <b>motor</b> are usually operated as three-phase and single-phase motors, respectively. In this respect, a dual AC-drive system can operate the traction and the <b>compressor</b> <b>motor</b> simultaneously. Furthermore, compared to a conventional dual matrix converter system, the proposed topology can {{reduce the number of}} switches that the dual outputs share with a DC-link. The application of this system for HEV has advantages, like long lifetime and reduced volume {{due to the lack of}} a DC-link. The proposed control strategy and modulation schemes ensure the sinusoidal input and output waveforms and bidirectional power transmission.

40|$|One {{physiological}} {{method for}} estimating the <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> number in a muscle depends on dividing into the maximum compound muscle action potential, the potential {{average of the}} first few <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potentials excited by a motor nerve stimulus above motor threshold. To be valid, such an average unit potential size must {{be representative of the}} whole <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> population. This assumption may not be justified. The present study has shown that there are single <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> in healthy and abnormal, thenar, and EDB <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> populations, many times larger than any <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> excited close to the motor threshold. This finding suggests that previously reported <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> estimates may not only be an overestimate of the true <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> population number, but have excluded much larger <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> with higher thresholds. Low <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> estimates in neuropathies may result from a change in the order of activation of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> with the appearance of larger <b>motor</b> <b>units,</b> normally of higher threshold among the first few just above the motor threshold...|$|R
50|$|Neural changes like reduced <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> {{discharge}} rates, increased {{variability of}} <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> discharge activity, altered recruitment and derecruitment behavior mediate modifications in muscle control. On the other hand, physiological deleterious factors including <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> loss, increased <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> innervation ratios also affect muscle force. Through strength training, old adults can significantly improve their force control. The rapid adaptation suggests modifications in <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> activation, increased excitability of motoneuron pool, and decreased antagonist cocontraction.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relative proportion of motor-unit action potentials that are uniquely represented in the simulated and experimental surface electromyogram (EMG). Two hundred <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> were simulated in a cylindrical anatomical system. Action potentials for each <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> were generated with a model and then {{compared with those of}} other <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b> Pairs of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> were considered indistinguishable and the <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> not uniquely represented in the surface EMG, when the difference in the mean energy for the pair of potentials was < 5 %. The anatomical conditions and recording configurations had a substantial influence on the percentage of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> that could be uniquely identified in the simulated EMG. For example, a single monopolar channel could discriminate only 3. 4 % of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> in the simulated population, whereas a system with 81 Laplacian channels arranged in a grid could discriminate 83. 8 % of the <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> under the same conditions. The simulation results were confirmed with populations of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> recorded experimentally from the abductor digiti minimi muscle of eight healthy men. Furthermore, the relative proportion of uniquely identified <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> in the simulated signal was only moderately related to motor-unit size and distance from the electrodes. These results indicate the upper limit for detection of individual <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> from the surface EMG and show that a few channels of surface EMG recordings are not sufficient to study single <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b> The noninvasive identification of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> from the surface EMG requires the use of multiple channels of information...|$|R
50|$|A <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> {{is defined}} as one motor neuron {{and all of the}} muscle fibers it innervates. When a <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> fires, the impulse (called an action potential) is carried down the motor neuron to the muscle. The area where the nerve {{contacts}} the muscle is called the neuromuscular junction, or the motor end plate. After the action potential is transmitted across the neuromuscular junction, an action potential is elicited in all of the innervated muscle fibers of that particular <b>motor</b> <b>unit.</b> The sum of all this electrical activity is known as a <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> action potential (MUAP). This electrophysiologic activity from multiple <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> is the signal typically evaluated during an EMG. The composition of the <b>motor</b> <b>unit,</b> the number of muscle fibres per <b>motor</b> <b>unit,</b> the metabolic type of muscle fibres and many other factors affect the shape of the <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potentials in the myogram.|$|R
40|$|Virtually all {{movements}} {{involve the}} recruitment of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> from multiple muscles. Given the functional diversity of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> (motoneurons and the muscle fibers they supply), the effective production of specific movements undoubtedly depends upon some principle(s) to organize the ensemble of active <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b> The principle acting to organize {{the recruitment of}} <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> within muscles is the size principle, whereby the first <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> to be recruited have the smallest values for axonal conduction velocity and contractile force, and are the slowest to contract and fatigue. Here we {{consider the possibility that}} the size principle applies in the recruitment of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> across muscles, i. e., that regardless of their muscles of origin, active <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> are recruited in rank order, for example, from low to high conduction velocity. The benefits of orderly recruitment across muscles could be similar to the acknowledged advantages of orderly recruitment within muscles. One benefit is that the neural process involved in organizing active <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> would be simplified. In a muscle-based scheme, the size principle would organize only those <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> within individual muscles, leaving the nervous system with the additional task of coordinating the relative activities of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> from different muscles. By contrast, in an ensemble-based scheme, orderly recruitment of all <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> according to the size principle would automatically coordinate <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> both within and across motor nuclei. Another potential benefit is the provision for movements with smooth trajectory, the result of interleaving the divergent torque contributions made by <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> from muscles that differ in their orientations about joints. Otherwise, if order were restricted within muscles, the torque trajectory of a joint would change unevenly as participating muscles begin contracting at different times and grade activity at different rates. These considerations support speculation that <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> recruited from co-contracting muscles are collectively recruited according to the size principle...|$|R

50|$|<b>Motor</b> <b>units</b> are {{multiple}} muscle fibers bundled together. When a person {{wants to move}} their body to achieve a certain task, the brain sends an impulse signal that reaches the specific <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> through the spinal cord. After receiving the signal from the brain, the <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> contracts muscle fibers within the group to create movement. There is no partial firing in the <b>motor</b> <b>unit,</b> meaning, once the signal is detected, all the muscles fibers within the unit contract. However, there are different intensities. Since each <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> contracts 100% of its fiber once stimulated, types of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> that generate different force or speed are significant.|$|R
5000|$|The {{central nervous}} system has two {{distinct}} ways of controlling the force produced by a muscle through <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> recruitment: spatial recruitment and temporal recruitment. Spatial recruitment is the activation of more <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> to produce a greater force. Larger <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> contract along with small <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> until all muscle fibers in a single muscle are activated, thus producing the maximum muscle force. Temporal <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> recruitment, or rate coding, deals with the frequency of activation of muscle fiber contractions. Consecutive stimulation on the <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> fibres from the alpha motor neuron causes the muscle to twitch more frequently until the twitches [...] "fuse" [...] temporally.

Relatively few studies have directly compared <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> behavior before and after training.

The purpose of the study was to compare the strength of <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchronization (CIS index) during isometric, position-holding, and slow (1. 7 degrees/s) shortening and lengthening (anisometric) contractions of the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI). <b>Motor</b> <b>unit</b> activity was recorded from the same <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> during these tasks with two fine-wire intramuscular electrodes in FDI. For comparison between the isometric and the position-holding task, 9 <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> pairs were sampled from 6 subjects. The strength of <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchronization (CIS ± SD imp/s) was greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) during position holding (0. 86 ± 0. 31 imp/s) than isometric contractions (0. 69 ± 0. 40 imp/s). For all task conditions, 5 <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> pairs were sampled from 4 subjects. <b>Motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchronization was greatest for the anisometric contractions (1. 24 ± 0. 66 imp/s), intermediate for the position holding (0. 81 ± 0. 38 imp/s) and least for the isometric contractions (0. 70 ± 0. 48 imp/s).

40|$|A {{wide range}} of <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> sizes exists in each frog sartorius, with values of tetanus and twitch {{tensions}} extending over 62 - and 400 -fold ranges, respectively. These differences primarily represent differences in the number, rather than the size, of muscle fibres in each <b>motor</b> <b>unit.</b> Tetanus-to-twitch tension ratios varied markedly between different <b>motor</b> <b>units,</b> ranging from 1. 5 to over 190. Because directly stimulated muscle fibres have tetanus/twitch ratios no larger than 3, it is concluded that high tetanus/twitch ratios arise from recruitment of muscle fibres during the tetanus which respond with only subthreshold depolarization during a twitch. Small <b>motor</b> <b>units,</b> as judged either by their twitch or tetanus tension, were associated with higher tetanus/twitch ratios, suggesting that the average safety margin of a <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> increases with the <b>motor</b> <b>unit's</b> size. Indeed, when the tetanus/twitch ratio of a <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> is {{used to determine the}} fraction of fibres in the unit with subthreshold neuromuscular junctions, it is observed that there is a direct linear relationship between the size of the <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> and its over-all efficacy of synaptic transmission. Measurements of the effects of changes in calcium concentration on <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> twitch tension confirmed the last conclusion. Furthermore, this analysis revealed that large <b>motor</b> <b>units,</b> although having a {{wide range of}} transmission safety margins, are largely comprised of junctions of uniformly high safety margin.

40|$|The {{development}} of an energy efficient air conditioning system for electric vehicles is an ever increasing challenge, because the cooling {{as well as the}} heating of the passenger cell reduces the cruising range dramatically. Almost always the compressor of the air conditioning system in electric cars is a scroll compressor with a separate electric motor and appropriate power electronics. However, this solution is critical in terms of the installation space, the weight and also the costs. Therefore, IAV develops innovative and energy efficient drivetrain structures for electric vehicles, which integrate the motor of the air conditioning compressor directly into the drivetrain of the vehicle. Thus it is possible to switch off the <b>compressor</b> <b>motor</b> and to use the main motor for the propulsion of the air conditioning compressor at certain driving situations. As a result the operating point of the main motor can be shifted to a better efficiency. This leads to a reduced power loss and an enhanced cruising range. In addition the <b>compressor</b> <b>motor</b> can be used for the propulsion of the vehicle, too, if the efficiency of the <b>compressor</b> <b>motor</b> is higher than the efficiency of the main motor, e. g. at urban traffic. Thereby the efficiency and the cruising range of the vehicle can be increased. This contribution presents a new powertrain concept which realizes the above-mentioned mechanical coupling of the main <b>motor</b> and the <b>compressor</b> <b>motor.</b> Moreover, the developed simulation models for the air conditioning system, the passenger cell and the drivetrain of electric vehicles are introduced.

Individual <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> firings were identified by a fine-wire intramuscular electrode, while STA-derived potentials were extracted from the simultaneously recorded surface electromyographic (SEMG) signal. Amplitude-controlled contractions and contractions with typing tasks and mental stress were carried out. STA potentials were mostly derived from 20 s intervals of firing. <b>Motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchrony was estimated by peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs). An association between SEMG amplitude and STA-derived <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potentials was found: <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> area showed a four-fold increase when SEMG amplitude increased from 1. 5 to 10. 5 % of the root mean square-detected SEMG signal at maximal voluntary contraction (%EMGmax). Low- and higher threshold <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potentials, all with recruitment thresholds < 10 % EMGmax, had similar area at the same contraction amplitude. A significant increase in the STA-derived potentials was observed after 3 min of constant-amplitude contractions; however, this difference was reduced after 10 min and no longer present after 30 min of contraction. <b>Motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchrony accounted for, on average, 2. 8 % additional firings within 2 ms of the triggering <b>motor</b> <b>unit.</b> We conclude that the increase in STA-derived potentials with contraction amplitude is, to a major extent, due to <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchrony, limiting the applicability of this method in postural muscles presenting wide <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potentials.

Discharge rate for the tonic units decreased progressively (13. 9 ± 2. 7 to 11. 7 ± 2. 6 pulses s− 1; P = 0. 04) during the 99 ± 111 s contraction. Train rate, train duration and average discharge rate for the intermittent <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> did not change across 211 ± 153 s of intermittent discharge.
