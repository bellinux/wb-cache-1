2500|$|There are {{two common}} misconceptions about {{the purpose of}} the fuse in a BS 1363 plug, one is that it protects the {{appliance}} connected to the plug, and the other is that it protects against overloading.

The voltage drop should be taken into account, particularly when using a fuse in low-voltage applications.

40|$|Abstract:Two {{types of}} factory marked Sintox® {{ammunition}} were investigated from {{the composition of}} gunshot residue particles (GSR) and occurrence of marking substance points of view. The experiments were carried out with two cartridges of caliber 9 mm Luger (9 × 19 Parabellum) of two producers (Ruag Ammotec, Switzerland and Men, Germany). The first <b>cartridge</b> (<b>type</b> Action 4, Ruag Ammotec) contains gadolinium as a marking element, while the other <b>cartridge</b> (<b>type</b> PEP II, Men) is marked with gallium in gunpowder. Scanning electron microscopy equipped with EDAX analyzer (SEM/EDX) was used to detect and analyze the GSR particles in samples collected from the cartridges, barrels and shooter’s hands. Besides those, particles from the hit clothes placed at different shooting distances were collected and analyzed. The spreading of GSR cloud from the gun was observed using the high-speed camera. Results obtained clearly revealed that the way of ammunition production/construction and type of marking of ammunition can significantly influence the presence and detection reliability of marking elements in GSR. The detectability is affected also by the shooting distance...|$|R

5000|$|Lucas <b>type</b> <b>fuses</b> {{are used}} in old British-made or {{assembled}} automobiles. The physical length of this ceramic <b>type</b> of <b>fuse</b> is either 1 inch or 1.25 inch, with conical ends. Glass tube fuses have straight ends. Lucas <b>type</b> <b>fuses</b> usually use the same color-coding for the rated current. Lucas fuses have three ratings; the continuous current {{they are designed to}} carry, the instantaneous current at which they will fuse, and the continuous current at which they will also fuse. The figure found on Lucas fuses is the continuous fusing current which is twice the continuous ampere rating that the system should be using; this can be a source of confusion when replacing Lucas fuses with non Lucas fuses. The Lucas 1/4" [...] diameter glass tube fuse have a different length as compared to the standard US item. The Lucas 1/4" [...] diameter glass tube fuse is 1 and 5/32" [...] mm long, while the US standard 1/4" [...] glass tube fuse is 1 and 1/4" [...] mm long.|$|R

2500|$|In North America, fuses {{were used}} in {{buildings}} wired before 1960. These Edison base fuses would screw into a fuse socket similar to Edison-base incandescent lamps. [...] Ratings were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 amperes. To prevent installation of fuses with an excessive current rating, later fuse boxes included rejection features in the fuse-holder socket, commonly known as Rejection Base (<b>Type</b> S <b>fuses)</b> which have smaller diameters that {{vary depending on the}} rating of the fuse. This means that fuses can only be replaced by the preset (<b>Type</b> S) <b>fuse</b> rating. This is a North American, tri-national standard (UL 4248-11; CAN/CSA-C22.2 NO. 4248.11-07 (R2012); and, NMX-J-009/4248/11-ANCE). Existing Edison fuse boards can easily be converted to only accept Rejection Base (<b>Type</b> S) <b>fuses,</b> by screwing-in a tamper-proof adapter.
