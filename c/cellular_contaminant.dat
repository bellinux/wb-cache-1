40|$|To {{study the}} {{possible}} involvement of mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) related agent in human cancer we analysed 300 samples of human sera {{for the presence}} of antibodies to MMTV structural proteins. All sera were tested by immunoblotting to achieve high specificity. Out of 300 sera, 22 reacted with transframe protein p 30, 16 with the ribonucleoprotein p 14, six with the envelope glycoprotein gp 52 and three with the major core protein p 27. Reactivities to p 30 and p 14 were observed in sera from cancer patients and healthy controls; reactivities to p 27 and gp 52 predominated in sera of cancer patients.

40|$|The {{structural}} protein, NS, of purified {{vesicular stomatitis}} virus (VSV) is a phosphoprotein. In infected cells phosphorylated NS is found both {{free in the}} cytoplasm {{and as part of}} the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex containing both the 42 S RNA and the structural proteins L, N, and NS, indicating that phosphorylation occurs as an early event in viral maturation. VSV contains an endogenous protein kinase activity, probably of host region, which catalyzes the in vitro phosphorylation of the viral proteins NS, M, and L, but not of N or G. The phosphorylated sites on NS appear to be different in the in vivo and in vitro reactions, and are differentially sensitive to alkaline phosphatase. After removal of the membrane components of purified VSV with a dextran-polyethylene glycol two-phase separation, the kinase activity remains tightly associated with the viral RNP. However, viral RNP isolated from infected cells shows only a small amount of kinase activity. The protein kinase enzyme appears to be a <b>cellular</b> <b>contaminant</b> of purified VSV because an activity from the uninfected cell extract can phosphorylate in vitro the dissociated viral proteins NS and M. The virion-associated activity may be derived either from the cytoplasm or the plasma membrane of the host cell since both of these cellular components contain protein kinase activity similar to that found in purified VSV...|$|E

Sera frequently reacted with a 42 kDa protein which is a <b>cellular</b> <b>contaminant</b> of the virus. Mouse mammary tumour virus has been reported to be an aetiological agent of most mammary gland tumours, some lymphomas and renal carcinomas in mice (for review see Salmons & Giinzburg, 1987). Although it is a very suitable model of carcinogenesis in mice no such role for MMTV-like species has been demonstrated for human breast cancer. Antigens immunologically related to MMTV proteins have been found in human breast cancer tissues as well as in various mammary cancer cell lines. Retrovirus-like particles were purified from culture media of human mammary cell line T 47 D. Antigen immunologically related to MMTV gp 52 was detected in viral preparations and also in a soluble form in culture media (Keydar et al., 1984). Reverse transcriptase activity associated with retrovirus-like particles has recently been reported in monocytes from breast cancer patients (Al-Sumidaie et al., 1988). There exists a vast literature concerning the presence of antibodies of MMTV proteins in sera of breast cancer patients (see e. g. Witkin et al., 1980; Day et al. ...|$|E
5000|$|Biosorption is a metabolically passive process, {{meaning it}} does not require energy, and the amount of {{contaminants}} a sorbent can remove is dependent on kinetic equilibrium and the composition of the sorbents <b>cellular</b> surface. <b>Contaminants</b> are adsorbed onto the cellular structure.|$|R
40|$|The glycoproteins {{associated}} with the membranes of cytomegalovirions and dense bodies were characterized by their relative mobility, percentage of glucosamine incorporation, and molecular weight. Eight glycopolypeptides were repeatedly detectable. Three glycopolypeptides of higher molecular weight {{with low levels of}} glucosamine incorporation were occasionally detectable. These latter glycopolypeptides may be precursors or aggregates of the glycopolypeptides with lower molecular weights. The glycoproteins {{associated with}} the membranes were on the surface, as determined by iodination with 125 I of virions and dense bodies partially purified in gradients of D-sorbitol. Velocity centrifugation in linear gradients of D-sorbitol was used to obtain concentrated and partially purified preparations of infectious cytomegalovirus. Viral infectivity and the membranes of cytomegalovirions and dense bodies were stable in gradients of sorbitol, but <b>cellular</b> <b>contaminants</b> were not completely removed. Additional centrifugation in CsCl separated both <b>cellular</b> <b>contaminants</b> and viral nucleocapsids from virions and dense bodies. Many dense bodies, which are considered to be aberrant forms of cytomegalovirus, had the same size, sedimentation properties, and density as virions. Consequently, they were not separable from virions by various centrifugation techniques. Electron microscopy demonstrated that purified virions and dense bodies were qualitatively free of extraneous material and that each dense body was bounded by a membrane, as evidenced by its double-tract appearance. Antisera to a preparation of purified virions and dense bodies, or to their glycoproteins, contained antibodies that neutralized viral infectivity and reacted with antigens in cells infected with cytomegalovirus. However, these same antisera did not contain antibodies that reacted with uninfected cells. The glycoproteins {{associated with the}} membranes of cytomegalovirions and dense bodies are considered to be specified by the cytomegalovirus genome...|$|R
40|$|As an inanimate virus, {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) {{necessarily}} encodes all of its functions in its DNA. Isolation of pure viral DNA allows multiple downstream applications, including the creation of recombinant HSV strains, cloning of selected regions, and sequencing of viral DNA. The term nucleocapsid refers to {{the combination of the}} viral genome with the enclosing capsid; these viral genomes are necessarily linear and have been packaged for egress, even if they are not yet released from the cell. In contrast, viral DNA that is not associated with capsids may include episomal or concatenated forms and may have modifi-cations such as histones that are added within cells. During this protocol, the viral capsid protects the HSV genome from reagents that strip away and destroy most <b>cellular</b> <b>contaminants.</b> This procedure describes the isolation of viral nucleocapsids and their subsequent dissolution to purify clean, linear HSV DNA.

40|$|Immunomagnetic bead {{separation}} {{coupled with}} bead beating and real-time PCR {{was found to}} be a very effective procedure for the isolation, separation, and detection of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis from milk and/or fecal samples from cattle and American bison. Samples were spiked with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis organisms, which bound to immunomagnetic beads and were subsequently lysed by bead beating; then protein and <b>cellular</b> <b>contaminants</b> were removed by phenol-chloroform-isopropanol extraction prior to DNA precipitation. DNA purified by this sequence of procedures was then analyzed by conventional and real-time IS 900 -based PCR in order to detect M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis in feces and milk. By use of this simple and rapid technique, 10 or fewer M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis organisms were consistently detected in milk (2 -ml) and fecal (200 -mg) samples, making this sensitive procedure very useful and cost-effective for the diagnosis of clinical and subclinical Johne's disease (paratuberculosis) compared to bacteriological culture, which is constrained by time, labor, and expense under diagnostic laboratory conditions...|$|R
40|$|Two {{kinds of}} virus-specific {{structures}} were {{isolated from the}} cytoplasm of Detroit- 6 and human amnion cells producing oncornavirus-like particles. These structures represented A particles with the diameter of 70 to 80 nm and aggregated strands of nucleocapsids with the diameter of 3 and 6 nm. The structures were separated from <b>cellular</b> <b>contaminants</b> by isopycnic banding in linear sucrose gradients and subsequently further purified by sedimentation in velocity sucrose gradients. Their sedimentation coefficient was 250 and 150 S, respectively. Both structures contain 60, 45, and 35 S RNA species, and 150 S structures also contained 20 S RNA. The 35 and 20 S RNA from the 150 S structure formed hybrids with DNA enzymatically synthesized on extracellular virions. The structures displayed endogeneous polymerase activity, DNA product of the reaction being predominantly associated with 60 S RNA. No 70 S RNA {{was found in the}} cell structures of various densities. Also, the virions purified from tissue culture fluid contained 70 S RNA. These findings are consistent with those on extracellular maturation of oncornavirus RNA...|$|R
40|$|A rapid {{method for}} the {{isolation}} of intracytoplasmic A particles, the putative intracellular nucleoprotein cores of mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV), is presented. Spontaneous C 3 H/He mouse mammary tumors and transplantable mouse Leydig cell tumor were used as source material. Large aggregations of intracytoplasmic A particles were separated from <b>cellular</b> <b>contaminants</b> on discontinuous sucrose gradients and subsequently further purified by isopycnic banding in linear sucrose gradients. The purified particles were solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the structural proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified mouse mammary tumor virions were solubilized, and their proteins were analyzed in the same way. Comparison of co-electrophoretic gels indicated a lack of correlation in the molecular size of the major structural proteins in intracytoplasmic A particles and MTV. The three major proteins of the A particles were calculated to be 80, 000; 35, 000; and 20, 000 daltons. Five major polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bands were obtained with purified MTV; these were 90, 000; 69, 000; 55, 000; 37, 000; and 27, 500 daltons. These figures showed good correlation with those published for MTV by Nowinski et al. These results {{suggest the need for}} the reexamination of the current tenet that intracytoplasmic particles represent intracellular MTV nucleoprotein cores...|$|R
40|$|The rhoptries of Plasmodium species {{participate}} in merozoite invasion and {{modification of the}} host erythrocyte. However, only a few rhoptry proteins have been identified using conventional gene identification protocols. To investigate the protein organization of this organelle and to identify new rhoptry proteins, merozoite rhoptries from three different Plasmodium rodent species were enriched by sucrose density gradient fractionation, and subjected to proteome analysis using multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT); 148 proteins were identified. To distinguish abundant <b>cellular</b> <b>contaminants</b> from bona fide organellar proteins, a differential analysis comparing the proteins in the rhoptry-enriched fractions to proteins identified from whole cell lysates of P. berghei mixed asexual blood stages was undertaken. In addition, the proteins detected were analyzed {{for the presence of}} transmembrane domains, secretory signal peptide, cell adhesion motifs, and/or rhoptry-specific tyrosine-sorting motifs. Combining the differential analysis and bioinformatic approaches, a set of 36 proteins was defined as being potentially located to the Plasmodium rhoptries. Among these potential rhoptry proteins were homologues of known rhoptry proteins, proteases, and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. Molecular characterization and understanding of the supramolecular organization of these novel potential rhoptry proteins may assist in the identification of new intervention targets for the asexual blood stages of malaria...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) that is {{propagated}} in {{cell culture}} is purified from <b>cellular</b> <b>contaminants</b> that can confound experimental results. A {{number of different}} purification methods have been described, including methods that utilize fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and gradient ultracentrifugation. Thus, the constituents and experimental responses of RSV stocks purified by ultracentrifugation in sucrose and by FPLC were analyzed and compared by infectivity assay, Coomassie stain, Western blot, mass spectrometry, immuno-transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and ImageStream flow cytometry. The FPLC-purified RSV had more albumin contamination, but there was less evidence of host-derived exosomes when compared to ultracentrifugation-purified RSV as detected by Western blot and mass spectrometry for the exosome markers superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] (SOD 1) and the tetraspanin CD 63. Although the purified virus stocks were equally susceptible to nucleolin-receptor blocking by the DNA aptamer AS 1411, the FPLC-purified RSV was significantly less susceptible to anti-RSV polyclonal antibody neutralization; there was 69 % inhibition (p = 0. 02) of the sucrose ultracentrifugation-purified RSV, 38 % inhibition (p = 0. 03) of the unpurified RSV, but statistically ineffective neutralization in the FPLC-purified RSV (22 % inhibition; p = 0. 30). The amount of RSV neutralization of the purified RSV stocks was correlated with anti-RSV antibody occupancy on RSV particles observed by immuno-TEM. RSV purified by different methods alters the stock composition and morphological characteristics of virions {{that can lead to}} different experimental responses...|$|R
40|$|Immobilized insulin, {{prepared}} by coupling insulin directly to agarose or through hydrocarbon “connecting arms,” was demonstrated {{to be capable}} of firmly binding intact adipocytes and their ghosts. Various lines of evidence indicate that the insulin receptor on the plasma membrane, in addition to the insulin coupled to the agarose, was responsible for the observed binding. This evidence includes: (a) the finding that increasing the “arm” length increased the binding capacities of insulin-Sepharose affinity chromatographic columns, (b) specific inhibition and reversal by insulin and antiserum to insulin of the binding, as compared to lesser effects by other peptide hormones, (c) the indication that only the plasma membrane sacs, not the other <b>cellular</b> <b>contaminants</b> in the crude ghosts, are capable of binding, and (d) the impairment and restoration of trypsin-sensitive membrane binding sites that are also required for insulin biosensitivity. These findings support the idea that the insulin receptor is the trypsin-sensitive site. By use of the differential buoyant densities of the various cell-bead complexes that resulted from the interaction of adipocytes with insulin-Sepharose, a new procedure was developed to demonstrate and study the binding. These complexes could also be demonstrated by interference contrast microscopy. Binding readily occurred under conditions favorable for insulin stimulation of the cells. By coupling tracer amounts of [125 I]insulin to Sepharose or insulin-Sepharose, the effects of anti-insulin antisera, free insulin, and other peptide hormones and supplemental factors on the buoyant-density distribution of the complexes could be measured, as well as the effects of other ligands coupled to Sepharose...|$|R
40|$|Peptides {{present in}} the skin {{secretion}} of the South African frog, Xenopus laevis, have been analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and h. p. l. c. in the mass range 500 - 3200 Da. We have investigated the effects of successive glandular secretions induced by noradrenaline injections on these peptide levels and {{have found that the}} replenishment of the whole range of peptides is complete within 2 - 6 days. Intact secretory vesicles free of <b>cellular</b> <b>contaminants</b> contain a relatively large number of peptides with molecular masses in the range 2400 - 2700 Da. We have termed these peptides primary products or spacer peptides, since they originate from spacer regions of the precursors to xenopsin and caerulein. However, if the secretory vesicles are disrupted during the collection procedure and the solution containing the secretion is kept at room temperature for up to 2 h, relatively little of the larger peptides remain. By comparing the relative levels of the various peptides {{present in the}}se secretions we have found that the larger peptides are proteolytically cleaved into smaller fragments by a novel cleavage at the N-terminal side of a lysine residue (at Xaa-Lys bonds where Xaa is Leu, Gly, Ala or Lys). Preliminary evidence has been obtained suggesting that the larger intact peptides possess lytic activity whereas the smaller proteolytic fragments appear relatively inactive. This may represent a mechanism by which the secretions are rendered harmless to the frog itself, since prolonged exposure would be expected to result in toxic effects. The dorsal glands of X. laevis thus appear similar to endocrine glands, since they are involved in peptide biosynthesis, secretion and subsequent proteolytic degradation...|$|R
30|$|To purify human ZGs, human acini from healthy donors were {{obtained}} from transplantation centers through Prodo Laboratories (Irvine, CA) and used as the starting material for homogenization. The subsequent steps {{were the same as}} in mouse ZG isolation. As shown in Fig.  1 B, human ZG protein bands were stained with Coomassie Blue reagent and the entire lane were excised in thirty gel slices for in-gel tryptic digestion. In a GeLC–MS/MS analysis of human pancreatic ZGs, 180 proteins were identified including both membrane and content proteins (supplemental Table S 2). A Skyline human ZG protein spectral library was generated to facilitate the development of SRM transitions. Previously, only the proteomics analyses of human pancreatic juice have been reported in normal and diseased subjects (Doyle et al. 2012; Gronborg et al. 2004; Paulo et al. 2013; Williams 2013). Our results represent the first effort to identify pancreatic ZG proteins from human pancreatic acini. These results have the potential to identify species-specific ZG proteins. In fact, several human ZG proteins, including ZA 2 G, REG 3 A and 3 G, SYTL 2, and O 2 AG 1, have not been reported in our previous studies (Chen et al. 2006, 2008). We also highlighted the common proteins between our list and the reported proteins in normal human pancreatic juice (supplemental Table S 2) (Doyle et al. 2012). Because pancreatic juice collected clinically sometimes contains the ZG content proteins as well as blood and <b>cellular</b> <b>contaminants</b> (Doyle et al. 2012), proteins found in both datasets represent potential bona fide ZG content proteins. Because the peptide sequences used to quantify mouse Rab 3 D and VAMP 8 are conserved in human, we were able to obtain the absolute quantifications and determine the copy numbers per ZG for human Rab 3 D and VAMP 8 using the same LC-SRM transitions and AQUA peptides. The averaged copy number per ZG of human Rab 3 D from two replicate analyses was 1182 [*]±[*] 45 and that of VAMP 8 was 485 [*]±[*] 15 (mean[*]±[*]SEM).|$|R
40|$|AbstractDeletion of the cytoplasmic {{tails of}} the {{influenza}} A virus spike glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), {{has previously been}} shown to result in markedly defective virion morphogenesis (Jin et al., 1997, EMBO J. 16, 1236 – 1247). We have found that influenza A virus preparations lacking the HA and NA cytoplasmic tails (HAt−/NAt−) have a reduced vRNA to protein content, contain an increase in <b>cellular</b> RNA <b>contaminants,</b> and exhibit increased resistance to ultraviolet (UV) inactivation. There is also a direct correlation between abnormal virion morphology and reduced infectivity. The {{data suggest that the}} HAt−/NAt− virion population contains a broader range of number of packaged RNA segments than wild-type (wt) virus. Sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis indicated the presence of a subpopulation of virions with pronounced deformation in virion morphology and reduced infectivity. The role of the HA and NA cytoplasmic tails was examined further by using a trans-complementation assay and it was found that expression of wt HA and NA from cDNAs followed by HAt−/NAt− virus infection caused the formation of a pseudotype virus with wt sedimentation properties. Taken together the data indicate that the HA and NA cytoplasmic tails affect not only virion morphology but also proper genome packaging...|$|R

Surgically-retrieved spermatozoa may be used for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and/or cryopreservation. In this article, we review the surgical procedures for retrieving spermatozoa from both the epididymis and the testicle and provide technical details of the commonly used methods. A critical analysis of the advantages and limitations of the current surgical methods to retrieve sperm from males with obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia is presented along with an overview of the laboratory techniques routinely used to process surgically-retrieved sperm. Lastly, we summarize the results from the current literature of sperm retrieval, as well as the clinical outcome of ICSI in the clinical scenario of obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia...|$|R

After collecting the epididymal fluid or testicular tissue, laboratory techniques are used to remove <b>contaminants,</b> <b>cellular</b> debris, noxious microorganisms, and red blood cells. Processed spermatozoa may be used for intracytoplasmic sperm injection or eventually be cryopreserved. However, spermatozoa collected from either the epididymis or the testis are often compromised and more fragile than ejaculated ones. Therefore, sperm processing techniques should be used with great caution to avoid jeopardizing the sperm fertilizing potential in treatment cycles. In this review, we describe the current methods for processing surgically-retrieved specimens, either fresh or frozen- thawed, and provide the tips and pitfalls for facilitating the handling of such specimens. In addition, we present the available laboratory tools to aid in the identification of viable immotile spermatozoa to be used in conjunction with assisted reproductive techniques.

Isolated basement-membrane-like {{material was}} shown {{to be free of}} both <b>cellular</b> and matrix <b>contaminants,</b> on the basis of determinations of DNA, RNA, cholesterol, phosphorus and (Na+ + K+) -activated ATPase, combined with electron microscopy. Amino acid analyses showed that arterial basement-membrane-like material was composed of predominantly non-collagenous amino acids. Evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, reduced basement-membrane-like material comprised six major and about 30 minor components in the Mr range 10 000 - 600 000. One of the major peptides (Mr 225 000) was disulphide-linked. Periodic acid-Schiff staining of gels indicated that most high-molecular-weight components were glycoproteins. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis resolved reduced basement-membrane-like material into more than 100 components, with pI from 5 to 7. The disulphide-linked Mr- 225 000 peptide appeared heterogeneous, with pI of 5. 6 - 6. 0, and was considered to represent fibronectin. All major peptides were of non-collagenous nature, {{on the basis of their}} susceptibility to pepsin and resistance to collagenase. Purified myomedial basement-membrane-like material contained collagenous peptides, as indicated by the presence of hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. Sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of pepsin-treated and reduced basement-membrane-like material revealed five high-molecular-weight collagenous components appearing in the Mr range 105 000 - 375 000 relative to type I collagen standards...|$|R

Biomonitoring plays {{a vital role in}} strategies to identify, assess, and control contaminants. On the other hands in recent year's attention to polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals increased in aquatic environments because of their carcinogenic and mutagenic properties combined with their nearly ubiquitous distribution in depositional environments by oil pollution or industrial waste waters. The present research aimed to assess PAHs and Ni, V levels in surface sediments and bivalves (Anodonta cygnea) and the effects of PAHs and heavy metals (Ni,V) on the hemocyte of the Anodonta cygnea were investigated in 2 stations (Mahrozeh, Selke in Anzali Lagoon, North of Iran). Samples were collected during at 2 different periods of the year, Dry and rain seasons, (June & September) and to confirm our first observations, Cage station is added. The bivalves hemocytes were monitored for membrane injury by NRR methods (neutral red retention assay). Heavy metal (Ni, V) concentrations were determined by Atomic Absorption in Anodonta cygnea and the sediments in Anzali Lagoon. The vanadium concentration in bivalves and sediments was ND(not detect) - 0. 4231 μg/g and 1. 4381 - 306. 9603 μg/g dry weight respectively. Nickel concentration in bivalves and sediments was 0. 0231 - 1. 3351, 0. 4024 - 19. 3561 μg/g dry weight respectively. PAHs concentrations were determined by GC-Mass in Anodonta cygnea and the sediments. Average concentration of PAHs is 115 - 373. 788 ng/g dry weight in bivalves and average concentration of PAHs is 34. 85 - 1339. 839 ng/g dry weight in sediments. Bioaccumulation sediments factor(BASF) is high about PAHs (> 1) and BASF is low for Ni, V (< 1). Internal Damage mechanisms of bivalves hemocytes (cell mortality, dye leakage, decreased membrane stability, are observed (Lowe Methods). Statistical analysis was used to explore the relationship between altered <b>cellular</b> and above <b>contaminants.</b> There are power and negative correlations between PAHs and NRR method for hemocytes in Anodonta cygnea (P< 0. 0005), but good correlation is not observed between Ni, V and NRR method for hemocytes in every time.
