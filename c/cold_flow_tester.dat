40|$|Biodiesel {{is widely}} {{accepted}} as comparable fuel to diesel in compression ignition engines. It offers many advantages including: higher cetane number; reduced emissions of particulates, NOx, SOx, CO, and hydrocarbons; reduced toxicity; improved safety; and lower lifecycle CO 2 emissions. A characteristic of biodiesel limiting its application is its relatively poor low-temperature flow properties. Improvement of its low temperature flow characteristic still {{remains one of}} the major challenges when using biodiesel as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. The biodiesel fuels derived from fats or oils with significant amounts of saturated fatty compounds display higher cloud points and pour points thus limiting their applications. The <b>cold</b> <b>flow</b> properties of different biodiesel were evaluated with various additives towards the objectives of improving the viscosity, pour point and cloud point. Methanol ethanol, kerosene, Mg additives, etc. have been tried many researchers to improve the <b>cold</b> <b>flow</b> behavior of biodiesels.

40|$|Abstract. The {{chemical}} composition of biodiesel was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The {{cold filter plugging point}} of biodiesel was measured according to GB/T 20828 - 2007. The <b>cold</b> <b>flow</b> properties of biodiesel were investigated {{on the basis}} of the crystallization theory, including {{chemical composition}} and molecular structure. Biodiesel might be considered a pseudobinary mixture, namely, high-melting-point saturated fatty acid methyl esters and low–melting-point unsaturated ones. Bilayer crystal structure of biodiesel was founded. Bilayer structure with headgroups aligned next to each other inside the crystal and away from nonpolar bulk liquid was large platelet lamellae. The results showed that biodiesel was mainly composed of saturated fatty acid methyl esters (C 14 : 0 ～C 24 : 0) and unsaturated ones(C 16 : 1 ～C 22 : 1, C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 3). The <b>cold</b> <b>flow</b> properties for biodiesel were determined mainly by the amount and molecular structure of saturated fatty acid methyl esters. The long-straight-chain saturated fatty acid methyl esters tend to have relatively poor <b>cold</b> <b>flow</b> properties. The <b>cold</b> <b>flow</b> properties worsen with increasing the amount and carbon chain length of straight-chain saturated fatty acid methyl esters. The ways of adjusting biodiesel composition and treating with depression of cold filter plugging point were given; they could improve <b>cold</b> <b>flow</b> properties. 1...|$|R
