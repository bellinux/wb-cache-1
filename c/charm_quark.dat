This theoretical model required {{the existence of the}} as-yet undiscovered <b>charm</b> <b>quark.</b> The number of supposed quark flavors grew to the current six in 1973, when Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa noted that the experimental observation of CP violation could be explained if there were another pair of quarks.|$|E
25|$|D mesons are {{the lightest}} {{particle}} containing charm quarks. They are often studied to gain knowledge on the weak interaction. Since the D meson is the lightest meson containing a <b>charm</b> <b>quark,</b> it must change the <b>charm</b> <b>quark</b> into another quark to decay.

25|$|The {{proposal}} of Kobayashi and Maskawa heavily {{relied on the}} GIM mechanism put forward by Sheldon Lee Glashow, John Iliopoulos and Luciano Maiani, which predicted {{the existence of the}} then still unobserved <b>charm</b> <b>quark.</b> When in November 1974 teams at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) simultaneously announced the discovery of the J/ψ meson, it was soon after identified as a bound state of the missing <b>charm</b> <b>quark</b> with its antiquark. This discovery allowed the GIM mechanism {{to become part of the}} Standard Model. With the acceptance of the GIM mechanism, Kobayashi and Maskawa's prediction also gained in credibility. Their case was further strengthened by the discovery of the tau by Martin Lewis Perl's team at SLAC between 1974 and 1978. This announced a third generation of leptons, breaking the new symmetry between leptons and quarks introduced by the GIM mechanism. Restoration of the symmetry implied the existence of a fifth and sixth quark.|$|E
40|$|It {{is argued}} that when a pair of a <b>charmed</b> <b>quark</b> and a <b>charmed</b> {{antiquark}} is produced via one photon, {{the mass of the}} <b>charmed</b> <b>quark</b> is to be light, i. e., roughly 500 MeV, quite contrary to the heavy mass usually assumed. It is thus proposed that we have to discriminate between, at least, two kinds of the mass of the <b>charmed</b> <b>quark</b> that are exhibited in different situations...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{statistical}} {{approach in the}} framework of non-covariant perturbation theory the distributions for light and <b>charmed</b> <b>quarks</b> in the hadron have been derived, taking into account the mass of the <b>charmed</b> <b>quark.</b> The parameters of the model have been extracted from the comparison with NA 3 data on hadroproduction of J/#psi# particles. A reanalysis of the EMC data on charm production in muon-nucleon scattering has been performed. It has been found in comparison with the conventional source of <b>charmed</b> <b>quarks</b> from photon-gluon fusion, that the EMC data indicate the presence of an additional contribution from deep-inelastic scattering on <b>charmed</b> <b>quarks</b> at large x. The resulting admixture of the Fock states, containing <b>charmed</b> <b>quarks</b> in the decomposition of the proton wave function is of the order of 1 %. The approach presented for the excitation of the Fock states with <b>charmed</b> <b>quarks</b> can also be applied to states with beauty quarks {{as well as to the}} hadronic component of the virtual photon (resolved photon component).

500|$|The quark flavors {{were given}} their names for several reasons. The {{up and down}} quarks are named after {{the up and down}} {{components}} of isospin, which they carry. Strange quarks were given their name because they were discovered to be components of the strange particles discovered in cosmic rays years before the quark model was proposed; these particles were deemed [...] "strange" [...] because they had unusually long lifetimes. Glashow, who coproposed <b>charm</b> <b>quark</b> with Bjorken, is quoted as saying, [...] "We called our construct the 'charmed quark', for we were fascinated and pleased by the symmetry it brought to the subnuclear world." [...] The names [...] "bottom" [...] and [...] "top", coined by Harari, were chosen because they are [...] "logical partners for up and down quarks".

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of <b>charm</b> <b>quarks</b> in the partonic medium and its implication to the di-electron spectra in high energy heavy ion collisions. The <b>charm</b> <b>quarks</b> traversing a thermal medium is simulated by the relativistic Langevin equation for elastic scatterings of <b>charm</b> <b>quarks</b> by thermal partons in an expanding fireball. The transport coefficients of <b>charm</b> <b>quarks</b> are calculated by the in-medium T-matrix method, where a static heavy quark potential is used with parameters fitted by the lattice QCD results. The di-electron invariant mass spectra are computed in most central collisions and are compared to the STAR data. The angular correlations of di-electrons are almost the same in p+p and Au+Au collisions in the mass range 1. 1 <M< 2. 5 GeV/c^ 2 with the back-to-back feature. This means that the angular correlation is intact even with medium interaction at the RHIC energy. Comment: Revtex 4, 10 pages, 7 figures. Accepted version to PR...|$|R

2500|$|Because mesons are {{composed}} of quarks, they participate in both the weak and strong interactions. Mesons with net electric charge also participate in the electromagnetic interaction. Mesons are classified according to their quark content, total angular momentum, parity and various other properties, such as C-parity and G-parity. Although no meson is stable, those of lower mass are nonetheless more stable than the more massive, and hence are easier to observe and study in particle accelerators or in cosmic ray experiments. Mesons are also typically less massive than baryons, meaning {{that they are more}} easily produced in experiments, and thus exhibit certain higher energy phenomena more readily than do baryons.
