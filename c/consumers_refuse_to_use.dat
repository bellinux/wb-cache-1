Even tough there are many ways for sexual workers to prevent it, for instance using condom, and they know that, they still face difficulties to make it. This research was conducted to know the sexual workers’ experiences during <b>using</b> condom <b>to</b> prevent transmitted sexual disease. Researcher want to know deeply about the description of obey <b>to</b> <b>use</b> condom, difficulties were faced by sexual workers, solutions to solve the obstacles and the feeling of sexual workers when they failed <b>to</b> <b>use</b> condom. The study design was a qualitative research with phenomenological approach. This research was done <b>to</b> three participants <b>using</b> in-depth interview technique. The result shows that most of sexual workers knew the reasons why they have <b>to</b> <b>use</b> condom. In addition, they found obstacles during using condom, especially when the <b>consumer</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it. <b>To</b> overcome this problems, sexual workers had two ways, first they objected to service the client or kept continue to give services. It is hard for them since they need money for their life, and on the other hand, they got high risk to suffer transmitted sexual disease. Nurses’ roles are very important to help sexual workers solve their problem, for example: give health education not only for sexual workers but also for the consumers. Health education can be given directly or indirectly depending on the time and audience...|$|R

In 1919, the students and intellectuals involved in the May Fourth Movement called for another boycott of Japanese products, to which the public responded enthusiastically. Local chambers of commerce decided to sever economic ties with Japan, workers <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> work in Japanese-funded factories, <b>consumers</b> <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> buy Japanese goods, and students mobilised to punish those found selling, buying or using Japanese products.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the welfare {{effects of the}} introduction of GMO technology into a market in which a fraction of <b>consumers</b> <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> buy GMOs. Our theoretical model recognizes that segregation and identity preservation (IP) of non-GMOs may create costs for both IP producers and non-IP producers. Our results show how GMO-hating consumers may win or lose from the introduction of GMO technology. If IP creates costs for non-IP producers, indifferent consumers and GMO producers may be made worse off because others <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> consume GMOs. If GMO rejection is strong, IP producers win when GMOs are introduced, {{even though they do}} not produce GMOs. Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} consumer boycotts. Some consumers care {{not only about the}} products they buy but also about whether the firm behaves ethically. Other consumers do not care about the behavior of the firm but yet may like to give the impression of being ethical consumers. Consequently, to affect a firm’s ethical behavior, moral <b>consumers</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> buy from an unethical firm. Consumers who do not care about ethical behavior may join the boycott to (falsely) signal that they do care. In the firm’s choice between ethical and unethical behavior, the optimality of mixed and pure strategies depends on the cost of behaving ethically. In particular, when the cost is (relatively) low, ethical behavior arises from a prisoners’ dilemma as the firm’s optimal strategy. firm’s ethical code, consumer morality, boycotts...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth in}} demand and {{expenditure}} currently being {{experienced in the}} Australian health sector is also accompanied by a rise in dysfunctional customer behaviour, such as verbal abuse and physical violence, perpetrated against health service providers. While service failure and poor recovery are known to trigger consumer misbehaviour, this study investigates whether lower than expected perceived service quality generates cognitive and emotional appraisals that trigger two common forms of misbehaviour: refusal to participate and verbal abuse. Data were collected using a 2 [*]×[*] 2 between-subjects experiment administered via online written survey and analysed using path modelling. The findings indicate that perceptions of service encounter quality have an indirect effect on whether <b>consumers</b> <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> participate in the service and/or verbally abuse the service provider through the mediating effect of anger...|$|R
