5|$|The {{three-judge panel}} {{reviewed}} and rejected each item, affirming the defendants' <b>convictions</b> <b>and</b> sentences unanimously on January 22, 1990. Five {{months later the}} U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the trial}} and conviction, Scrushy, Siegelman, and the {{prosecutors}} all indicated they would appeal. Scrushy and Seigelman vowed to appeal their <b>convictions</b> <b>and</b> sentences, while the prosecution announced its desire to appeal a judge's decision to remove charges of perjury from Scrushy's indictment. The prosecutors quickly dropped their appeal, and United States Attorney Alice Martin indicated they had reconsidered.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, Samutsevich's new lawyer, Irina Khrunova, {{argued that}} her client had {{not in fact}} {{committed}} the acts of hooliganism in the church as she was prevented from accessing the soleas by church security. The court appeared to accept this argument, and released Samutsevich on two years' probation. However, the judges rejected the appeals of Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, upholding their <b>convictions</b> <b>and</b> sentences.|$|E

5|$|The {{office of}} the Secretary of the Navy ordered Admiral Wright to reconvene the courts-martial, this time with {{instructions}} to disregard the hearsay testimony. Admiral Osterhaus once again called the court to session for deliberation and on June 12, 1945, the court reaffirmed each of the mutiny <b>convictions</b> <b>and</b> sentences. Admiral Wright stuck by his reduced sentences.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials were}} fraught with irregularities. All three judges were pro-Goebel Democrats, {{and at one}} point the juror pool of 368 people was found to have only eight Republicans. Republican appeals courts {{overturned}} Powers' and Howard's convictions, though Powers was tried three more times, resulting in two <b>convictions</b> <b>and</b> a hung jury and Howard was tried and convicted twice more. Both men were pardoned in 1908 by Governor Augustus E. Willson.|$|E
5|$|Arrested and exposed, Sideshow Bob confesses that {{he hated}} Krusty {{and the reason}} he framed Krusty was because he spent years {{constantly}} being {{on the receiving end}} of the clown's humiliating gags. He vows revenge on Bart, setting up a regular plotline in future episodes. The charges against Krusty are dropped and he regains the trust of the community. Homer then apologizes to Krusty for fingering him in court, and Krusty thanks Bart for standing up for the truth and sticking to his <b>convictions,</b> <b>and</b> a picture is taken of the two shaking hands (which Bart later hangs in his bedroom, refilled with Krusty decor).|$|E
50|$|In August 1994, New York {{corporate}} lawyer Michael Alcamo accepted Bickham's case pro bono.

5|$|Federal DUI law {{differs from}} New Jersey law {{in that there}} are no {{mandatory}} minimum jail sentences, irrespective of the number of previous DUI <b>convictions,</b> <b>and</b> plea bargaining is allowed. A federal DUI conviction will result in unexpungeable criminal record. Federal courts cannot suspend a driver's license, but may notify the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission of a DUI conviction. In federal enclaves that are under the jurisdiction of other federal departments (e.g. Fish and Wildlife Service), it is unclear if drunk driving could be prosecuted since the Assimilative Crimes Act is inapplicable, and there is no federal law defining DUI on those properties.|$|E
5|$|Green was {{identified}} by county prosecutor David Gorcyca, {{who had been}} his neighbor. On November 30, Palace Sports and Entertainment, {{the owner of the}} Pistons, banned Green and Haddad from attending any events at Palace properties (including the Palace of Auburn Hills and the DTE Energy Music Theatre), revoked their season tickets and issued them refunds. Green had several previous criminal convictions, including counterfeiting, carrying a concealed weapon, felony assault, and three drunken driving <b>convictions,</b> <b>and</b> he was on court-ordered probation from a DUI conviction {{at the time of the}} brawl.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} his first criminal conviction in November 1977, aged 15, for burglary.

In January 1980 he was convicted of two further crimes including theft of property from his lodgings the night before De Simone's murder. He was subsequently convicted of a series of burglaries committed in Portsmouth for which he received an 18-month custodial sentence of which he served 9months. Following his release he committed robbery again and was sentenced at Portsmouth Crown Court to five years and nine months imprisonment, which he served at HMP Dartmoor.|$|E

5|$|In 1934 Gandhi {{resigned}} from Congress party membership. He did not {{disagree with the}} party's position but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business <b>convictions,</b> <b>and</b> that these various voices would {{get a chance to}} make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, Bradley {{was charged}} with several crimes {{stemming}} from five different domestic incidents which occurred in 2011 and 2012.

On July 2, 2013, he was sentenced to 32 months in prison and 52 weeks of domestic violence and anger-management classes, and was released on $250,000 bail. Despite his <b>convictions</b> <b>and</b> sentence, Bradley maintained sole custody of his and Monique's two sons.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's {{court system}} has three levels. Most cases {{start in the}} {{district}} courts, which are courts of general jurisdiction. There are 279 district court judgeships in ten judicial districts. Appeals from the trial courts and challenges to certain governmental decisions are heard by the Minnesota Court of Appeals, consisting of nineteen judges who typically sit in three-judge panels. The seven-justice Minnesota Supreme Court hears all appeals from the tax court, the workers' compensation court of appeals, first-degree murder <b>convictions,</b> <b>and</b> discretionary appeals from the court of appeals; it also has original jurisdiction over election disputes.|$|E
50|$|McMillian’s <b>conviction</b> <b>and</b> death {{sentence}} were affirmed on appeal in 1991. On February 23, 1993, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals reversed McMillian’s <b>conviction</b> <b>and</b> ordered a new trial. On March 2, 1993, prosecutors dismissed charges against McMillian {{and he was}} released as an exonerated man.|$|R
50|$|The judge {{sentence}}d Campbell {{to death}} on December 17, 1984. By 1989, the case {{had gone through the}} entire state court system.

50|$|Under Breuer’s tenure, the Criminal Division also {{secured the}} <b>conviction</b> <b>and</b> 30-year prison {{sentence}} {{of the former}} chairman of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker in a $3 billion bank fraud, <b>and</b> the <b>conviction</b> <b>and</b> 110-year prison sentence of R. Allen Stanford for perpetrating a $7 billion Ponzi scheme.|$|R
5|$|Two huge murals by Brazilian artist Cândido Portinari, {{entitled}} Guerra e Paz (War and Peace) {{are located}} at the delegates hall. The works are {{a gift from the}} United Nations Association of the United States of America and Portinari intended to execute them in the United States. However, he was denied a visa due to his communist <b>convictions</b> <b>and</b> decided to paint them in Rio de Janeiro. They were later assembled in the headquarters. After their completion in 1957, Portinari, who was already ill when he started the masterpiece, succumbed to lead poisoning from the pigments his doctors advised him to abandon.|$|E
5|$|During the 1952 presidential election, the Eisenhower {{campaign}} toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In {{a speech}} delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared {{that while he}} agreed with McCarthy's goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions of his speech, Eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor, George Marshall, which was a direct rebuke of McCarthy's frequent attacks. However, under the advice of conservative colleagues who were fearful that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters, he deleted this defense from later versions of his speech. The deletion was discovered by William H. Laurence, a reporter for The New York Times, and featured on its front page the next day. Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal <b>convictions,</b> <b>and</b> the incident became the low point of his campaign.|$|E
5|$|For {{a second}} DUI {{conviction}} in a 10-year period, irrespective of BAC, {{there is a}} fine of $500–$1,000, 2–90 days imprisonment, a 2-year license suspension, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1,000 a year for 3 years, and installation of an ignition interlock device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration.

Jail sentences issued in New Jersey for DUI are often served through work release programs (e.g. weekends in jail).|$|E

5|$|Orr's first {{professional}} contract {{was one of}} the first in professional ice hockey to be negotiated by an agent. It made him the highest-paid player in NHL history as a rookie. His second contract was the first million-dollar contract in the NHL. However, after his retirement, Orr learned he was deeply in debt and he had to sell off most of what he owned. Orr broke with his agent Alan Eagleson and sued the Black Hawks to settle his contract. Orr and his family returned to Boston where Orr went into business to rebuild his finances. Orr aided the investigations that led to Eagleson's fraud <b>convictions</b> <b>and</b> disbarment. Orr also supported the lawsuit that exposed the corruption of the NHL's pension plan.|$|E
5|$|Stone recovered, and was {{released}} from UCDMC on October 15, a week after he was stabbed. Sacramento Police detectives {{were assigned to the}} case shortly after the initial stabbing. Along with video obtained of the assault; eyewitness statements; and tips from the public, detectives determined the identity of the assailant, and an arrest warrant was issued for Tran. On November 4th, 2015, Tran was arrested without incident, after detectives, uniformed officers, and deputies from the Sacramento Police Department, Elk Grove Police Department, and Sacramento County Sheriff's Department conducted a traffic stop near his home in Elk Grove, California. Law enforcement officials involved in the case said that it did not appear Tran or anyone in his group knew of Stone's publicity. Officials also stated that the crime {{did not appear to be}} a retaliatory strike by a terrorist organization (either directly or indirectly) against Stone for his part in foiling a terror attack. Law enforcement officials stated that Tran has previous felony <b>convictions,</b> <b>and</b> that Tran was most likely intoxicated at the time of the assault.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} no {{absolute}} consensus about the adherence of the kings before Darius, such as Cyrus and Cambyses, it is well established that Darius was an adherent of Zoroastrianism {{or at least a}} firm believer in Ahura Mazda. As can be seen at the Behistun Inscription, Darius believed that Ahura Mazda had appointed him to rule the Achaemenid Empire. Darius had dualistic philosophical <b>convictions</b> <b>and</b> believed that each rebellion in his kingdom was the work of druj, the enemy of Asha. Darius believed that because he lived righteously by Asha, Ahura Mazda supported him. In many cuneiform inscriptions denoting his achievements, he presents himself as a devout believer, perhaps even convinced that he had a divine right to rule over the world.|$|E
