5|$|Caprella mutica inhabit shallow {{protected}} marine {{bodies of}} water. They {{can often be}} found in dense colonies attached to submerged artificial structures, marine macroalgae, and other organisms. They are primarily omnivorous detritivores, but can adapt to other feeding methods depending on food availability. They are preyed upon by fish, <b>crabs,</b> <b>and</b> several other predators.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} about a control design for {{complete}} structure of the crane: <b>crab,</b> bridge <b>and</b> crane uplift. The most important unknown parameters for simulations are burden weight and length of hanging rope. We will use robust control for <b>crab</b> <b>and</b> bridge control to ensure adaptivity for burden weight and rope length. Robust control will be designed for current control of the <b>crab</b> <b>and</b> bridge, necessary is to know the range of unknown parameters. Whole robust will be split to subintervals and after correct identification of unknown parameters the most suitable robust controllers will be chosen. The most important condition at the <b>crab</b> <b>and</b> bridge motion is avoiding from burden swinging in the final position. <b>Crab</b> <b>and</b> bridge drive is designed by asynchronous motor fed from frequency converter. We will use crane uplift with burden weight observer in combination for uplift, <b>crab</b> <b>and</b> bridge drive with cooperation of their parameters: burden weight, rope length <b>and</b> <b>crab</b> <b>and</b> bridge position. Controllers are designed by state control method. We will use preferably a disturbance observer which will identify burden weight as a disturbance. The system will be working in both modes at empty hook {{as well as at}} maximum load: burden uplifting and dropping down. For uplift drive we will use an asynchronous motor fed from frequency converter. Simulations are proposed for situation that firstly we do uplift and then switching block realize simultaneous <b>crab</b> <b>and</b> bridge motion. At simulations it is possible to choose different burden weight, rope length, <b>crab</b> <b>and</b> bridge positions and speeds...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} sea anemone species are {{commensal}} with other organisms. Certain <b>crabs</b> <b>and</b> hermit crabs seek out sea anemones {{and place them}} on their shells for protection, and fish, shrimps and crabs live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining protection by being {{in close proximity to}} the stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the sea anemone. Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.|$|E
5|$|Community ecology is {{the study}} of the {{interactions}} among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area. Community ecologists study the determinants of patterns and processes for two or more interacting species. Research in community ecology might measure species diversity in grasslands in relation to soil fertility. It might also include the analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions between <b>crabs</b> <b>and</b> corals.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Native Americans ate {{the flesh}} of {{horseshoe}} <b>crabs,</b> <b>and</b> used the tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes. More recent attempts to use horseshoe crabs as food for livestock were abandoned when {{it was found that}} this gave the meat a bad taste. Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, limulus amebocyte lysate, which is used to test antibiotics and kidney machines to ensure that they are free of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.|$|E

5|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the Chelicerata contain the classes Arachnida (spiders, scorpions, mites, etc.), Xiphosura (horseshoe <b>crabs)</b> <b>and</b> Eurypterida (sea scorpions, extinct). The extinct Chasmataspida may be a sub-group within Eurypterida. The Pycnogonida (sea spiders) were traditionally classified as chelicerates, but some features suggest they may be representatives of the earliest arthropods from which the well-known groups such as chelicerates evolved.|$|E
5|$|Its {{inaccessible}} {{habitat and}} retiring nature {{mean that the}} snoring rail is rarely seen and little is known of its behaviour. Only the adult plumage has been described, and the breeding behaviour is unrecorded. It feeds on small <b>crabs</b> <b>and</b> probably other small prey such as lizards. Although protected under Indonesian law since 1972, the rail is threatened by habitat loss (even within nature reserves), hunting for food and predation by introduced species; it is therefore evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as <b>crabs</b> <b>and</b> spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
5|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} {{feeds on}} shrimp, small bony fish, mollusks, <b>crabs</b> <b>and</b> other worms. Due {{to the fact}} that this ray is a shallow bottom feeder, it has a small variety of marine life to prey on. The bluespotted stingray overpowers its prey by pinning them {{to the bottom of the}} seafloor with its fins. The bluespotted stingray has numerous tiny teeth, with the lower jaw being slightly convex. They also, like most stingrays, have plate-like teeth to crush prey.|$|E
5|$|The bowmouth {{guitarfish}} is {{a strong}} swimmer that propels itself with its tail like a shark. It is more active at night and is not known to be territorial. This species feeds mainly on demersal bony fishes such as croakers and crustaceans such as <b>crabs</b> <b>and</b> shrimp; bivalves and cephalopods are also consumed. Its bands of flattened teeth allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. Curiously, two bowmouth guitarfishes examined in a 2011 stable isotope study {{were found to have}} fed on pelagic rather than demersal animals, in contrast to previous observations.|$|E

5|$|The diet of the Arctic tern varies {{depending}} on location and time, but is usually carnivorous. In most cases, it eats small fish or marine crustaceans. Fish species comprise {{the most important part}} of the diet, and account for more of the biomass consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1â€“2-year old) shoaling species such as herring, cod, sandlances, and capelin. Among the marine crustaceans eaten are amphipods, <b>crabs</b> <b>and</b> krill. Sometimes, these birds also eat molluscs, marine worms, or berries, and on their northern breeding grounds, insects.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the nervous}} shark {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes (including silversides, smelt-whitings, wrasses, and grunters). Crustaceans (including prawns, <b>crabs,</b> <b>and</b> mantis shrimps) and molluscs (predominantly cephalopods but also bivalves and gastropods) constitute secondary food sources. This shark is also known to occasionally prey on the semiaquatic snakes Cerberus rynchops and Fordonia leucobalia. A known parasite {{of the nervous}} shark is the myxosporean Kudoa carcharhini.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{tilefish}} larvae is unknown, but it {{is believed}} to be zooplankton. Juvenile and adults are omnivorous with a preference for small benthic invertebrates, with a staple being <b>crabs</b> <b>and</b> lobster. Great northern tilefish also consume bivalve molluscs, salps, squid, Atlantic dogfish, mackrel, hagfish, and herring. Human trash is also eaten, including potato peels and meat bones. They also eat other tilefish in a display of cannibalistism.|$|E

5|$|The {{shell and}} soft parts of living L.gigas {{serve as a}} home to several {{different}} kinds of commensal animals, including slipper snails, porcelain <b>crabs</b> <b>and</b> cardinalfish. Its parasites include coccidians. The queen conch is hunted and eaten by several species of large predatory sea snails, and also by starfish, crustaceans and vertebrates (fish, sea turtles and humans). Its shell is sold as a souvenir and used as a decorative object. Historically, Native Americans and indigenous Caribbean peoples used parts of the shell to create various tools.|$|E
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} {{may be one of}} the few fishes specializing in preying on octopus. Other known food items include corals, sea urchins, {{crustaceans}} (e.g. <b>crabs</b> <b>and</b> lobsters), squid, small fishes (e.g. surgeonfish, queenfish, and rabbitfish), and the occasional sea snake. Hunting {{tawny nurse shark}}s swim slowly just above the sea floor, poking their heads into depressions and holes. When a prey item is found, the shark forcefully expands its large, muscular pharynx, creating a powerful negative pressure that sucks the prey into its mouth.|$|E
