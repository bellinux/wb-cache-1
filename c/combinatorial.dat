5|$|Some {{applications}} of <b>combinatorial</b> game theory to chess endgames were found by Elkies (1996).|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} systematicity and {{productivity}} {{depend on the}} compositional structure of language means that language has a <b>combinatorial</b> semantics. If thought also has such a <b>combinatorial</b> semantics, then {{there must be a}} language of thought.|$|E

5|$|Chess has {{inspired}} many <b>combinatorial</b> puzzles, {{such as the}} knight's tour and the eight queens puzzle.|$|E
5|$|RNA interference-based {{applications}} {{are being developed}} to target persistent HIV-1 infection. Viruses like HIV-1 are particularly difficult targets for RNAi-attack because they are escape-prone, which requires <b>combinatorial</b> RNAi strategies to prevent viral escape.|$|E
5|$|The quasi-isometry {{properties}} of the history graph can be studied using subdivision rules. For instance, the history graph is quasi-isometric to hyperbolic space exactly when the subdivision rule is conformal, {{as described in the}} <b>combinatorial</b> Riemann mapping theorem.|$|E
5|$|In a multi-paper sequence, Dynnikov {{has studied}} the topological book embeddings of knots and links, showing that these embeddings can be {{described}} by a <b>combinatorial</b> sequence of symbols and that the topological equivalence of two links can be demonstrated by a sequence of local changes to the embeddings.|$|E
25|$|The {{connection}} of the Bernoulli number to {{various kinds of}} <b>combinatorial</b> numbers {{is based on the}} classical theory of finite differences and on the <b>combinatorial</b> interpretation of the Bernoulli numbers as an instance of a fundamental <b>combinatorial</b> principle, the inclusion–exclusion principle.|$|E
25|$|Discrete {{geometry}} and <b>combinatorial</b> geometry are about <b>combinatorial</b> properties of discrete collections of geometrical objects. A long-standing topic in discrete geometry is tiling of the plane. Computational geometry applies algorithms to geometrical problems.|$|E
25|$|Algebraic {{combinatorics}} {{is an area}} {{of mathematics}} that employs methods of abstract algebra, notably group theory and representation theory, in various <b>combinatorial</b> contexts and, conversely, applies <b>combinatorial</b> techniques to problems in algebra. Algebraic combinatorics is continuously expanding its scope, in both topics and techniques, and {{can be seen as the}} area of mathematics where the interaction of <b>combinatorial</b> and algebraic methods is particularly strong and significant.|$|E
25|$|If a {{polyhedron}} has Schläfli symbol {p,q}, {{then its}} dual has the symbol {q,p}. Indeed, every <b>combinatorial</b> property of one Platonic solid {{can be interpreted}} as another <b>combinatorial</b> property of the dual.|$|E
25|$|<b>Combinatorial</b> {{optimization}} is {{the study}} of optimization on discrete and <b>combinatorial</b> objects. It started as a part of combinatorics and graph theory, but is now viewed as a branch of applied mathematics and computer science, related to operations research, algorithm theory and computational complexity theory.|$|E
25|$|Analytic {{combinatorics}} {{concerns the}} enumeration (i.e., determining the number) of <b>combinatorial</b> structures using tools from complex analysis and probability theory. In contrast with enumerative combinatorics which uses explicit <b>combinatorial</b> formulae and generating functions {{to describe the}} results, analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining asymptotic formulae.|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} core of {{the subject}} of <b>combinatorial</b> designs is built around balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs), Hadamard matrices and Hadamard designs, symmetric BIBDs, Latin squares, resolvable BIBDs, difference sets, and pairwise balanced designs (PBDs). Other <b>combinatorial</b> designs are related to or have been developed {{from the study of}} these fundamental ones.|$|E
25|$|The {{composer}} then {{presents the}} aggregate. If {{there are multiple}} serial sets, or if several parameters {{are associated with the}} same set, then a presentation will have these values calculated. Large-scale design may be achieved through the use of <b>combinatorial</b> devices, for example, subjecting a subset of the basic set to a series of <b>combinatorial</b> devices.|$|E

25|$|This {{result in}} turn is proved by {{considering}} a dual diagram for D. There one defines a <b>combinatorial</b> notion of curvature (which, by the small cancellation assumptions, is negative at every interior vertex), and one then obtains a <b>combinatorial</b> version of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem. Greendlinger's lemma is proved {{as a consequence of}} this analysis and in this way the proof evokes the ideas of the original proof of Dehn for the case of surface groups.|$|E
