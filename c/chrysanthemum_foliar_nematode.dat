50|$|Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi (Black currant nematode, <b>Chrysanthemum</b> <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode,</b> Chrysanthemum leaf nematode, Chrysanthemum nematode, Chrysanthemum Foliar eelworm) is a plant {{pathogenic}} nematode. It {{was first}} scientifically described in 1890 in England. This nematode {{has a wide}} host range. Among the most important species affected are Chrysanthemums and strawberries. A. ritzemabosi is a migratory foliar feeding nematode. It can feed both ectoparasitically and endoparasitically, with the later causing the most significant damage. When adequate moisture is present, this nematode enters the leaves and feeds from inside the tissue. Typical damage is characterized by necrotic zones between the veins of the leaves. Its lifecycle is short; only ten days from egg to mature adult. A single female can lay as many as 3,500 eggs. This pest {{can be difficult to}} control. Host plant resistance, hot water treatments, and predatory mites are recommended.|$|E
40|$|The <b>chrysanthemum</b> <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> (CFN), Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi, is a plant {{parasitic}} nematode that attacks many plants. In this study, a transcriptomes of mixed-stage {{population of}} CFN was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. 68. 10 million Illumina high quality paired end reads were obtained which generated 26, 817 transcripts {{with a mean}} length of 1, 032 bp and an N 50 of 1, 672 bp, of which 16, 467 transcripts were annotated against six databases. In total, 20, 311 coding region sequences (CDS), 495 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 8, 353 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were predicted, respectively. The CFN with the most shared sequences was B. xylophilus with 16, 846 (62. 82 %) common transcripts and 10, 543 (39. 31 %) CFN transcripts matched sequences of all of four plant parasitic nematodes compared. A total of 111 CFN transcripts were predicted as homologues of 7 types of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) with plant/fungal cell wall-degrading activities, fewer transcripts were predicted as homologues of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes than fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes. The phylogenetic analysis of GH 5, GH 16, GH 43 and GH 45 proteins between CFN and other organisms showed CFN and other nematodes have a closer phylogenetic relationship. In the CFN transcriptome, sixteen types of genes orthologues with seven classes of protein families involved in the RNAi pathway in C. elegans were predicted. This research provides comprehensive gene expression information at the transcriptional level, which will facilitate the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of CFN {{and the distribution of}} gene functions at the macro level, potentially revealing improved methods for controlling CFN...|$|E
40|$|During a {{nematode}} {{survey on}} cut {{flowers in the}} Pakdasht Region, Tehran Province, Iran, a species of foliar nematode belonging to the genus Aphelenchoides Fischer was detected in leaves of 10 - to 11 -month-old, greenhouse-grown (26 to 28 °C) chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflorum Kitam., cv. Puja) plants. Chrysanthemum leaves appeared discolored and slightly deformed. Diseased plants comprised approximately 40 % of all plants in the greenhouse and occurred in scattered clumps along irrigation paths. Spots and blackish brown, irregular, necrotic areas occupied 5 to 50 % of the leaf surface. Symptomatic tissue contained females, males, juveniles, and embryonated eggs of the nematode. All life stages of the nematode were detected in the mesophyll of younger and older infected leaves. The nematode population was extracted and quantified from symptomatic samples of 5 g of leaf tissues by modified Baermann funnel extraction and from 250 g of soil with a modification of the sugar centrifugal flotation method (1), counted, and identified. Morphological observations showed four incisures in the lateral field, excretory pore posterior to nerve ring, ovary single with oocytes in multiple rows, post-vulval uterine sac extending more than one-half of the vulva-anus distance, often containing sperm, tail elongate-conoid bearing a terminal peg with 2 to 4 minute processes. Males common (40 % of females) posteriorly curved through 180 ° upon relaxation, tail conoid bearing a terminal peg with 2 to 3 processes. Measurements of 14 females and 11 males (body length = 987 ± 48 μm, a = 49. 2 ± 4. 4, b = 12. 3 ± 1. 1, c = 20. 6 ± 2. 8, V = 71 ± 1. 7, T = 49 ± 2. 3, stylet length = 12. 6 ± 0. 6 μm, tail length = 47. 9 ± 5. 2 μm; position of vulva = 70. 8 ± 1. 7 %; spicules length = 22. 8 ± 1. 4 μm) conformed to {{the description of the}} <b>chrysanthemum</b> <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi (Schwartz) Steiner & Buhrer, (2).

5000|$|<b>Foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> are an {{important}} plant pathogen to agricultural crops and ornamental plants in the United States, Canada, and Europe. [...] Aphelenchoides fragariae nematodes are found in over 200 plant host species, including crop species strawberry and alfalfa, and ornamental species Begonia, Chrysanthemum, Dahlia, Ficus, Hibiscus, Hosta, Viola, ferns, and Zinnia. [...] Since 1991-1992, strawberry <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> incidence numbers have been increasing {{in a variety of}} plants, but especially in strawberry and greenhouse plants such as Hosta.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> are plant {{parasitic}} roundworms in {{the genus}} Aphelenchoides. The three most economically important species are Aphelenchoides fragariae, A. ritzemabosi, and A. besseyi. <b>Foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> {{are becoming a}} widespread and serious problem for the ornamental and nursery industries. A. fragariae causes damage on hundreds of different plants including chrysanthemum, begonia, gloxinia, African violet, cyclamen, and {{a wide variety of}} bedding plants and ferns, causing brown to black, vein-delimited lesions on leaf tissue, defoliation, and possible stunting of plants.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} species {{of these are}} Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi, the <b>chrysanthemum</b> <b>foliar</b> nematode; Aphelenchoides fragariae, the spring crimp or spring dwarf nematode of strawberry, which also attacks many ornamentals; and Aphelenchoides besseyi, causing summer crimp or dwarf of strawberry and white tip of rice.|$|R
40|$|Population {{dynamics}} of Aphelenchoides fragariae were assessed over three growing seasons and during overwintering for naturally-infected, container-grown lantana (Latana camara) plants in a North Carolina nursery. During the growing season, the <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> population in symptomatic leaves peaked in July each year then remained above 100 nematodes/g fresh weight into late summer. <b>Foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> were also detected in asymptomatic and abscised leaves. Results suggest that leaves infected with <b>foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> first develop symptoms at populations of about 10 nematodes/g. <b>Foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> were detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic plant leaves and in abscised leaves during overwintering in a polyhouse, {{but the number}} of infected plants was low. A steep disease gradient was found for infection of lantana plants by A. fragariae on a nursery pad with sprinkler irrigation. When the canopies of initially healthy plants were touching the canopies of an infected plants, 100 % of the plants became infected within 11 wk, but only 5 to 10 % became infected at a canopy distance of 30 cm. Overwintering of A. fragariae in infected plants and a steep disease gradient during the growing season suggests strict sanitation and an increase in plant spacing are needed to mitigate losses from this nematode pest...|$|R
40|$|The <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> Aphelenchoides fragariae is an {{economically}} important and frequent pest of ornamental crops. In nurseries and landscapes in the United States, <b>foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> {{can be a}} serious problem affecting hostas (Hosta spp.), a common perennial ornamental plant that thrives in shady environments. Fundamental research on the biology and ecology of this nematode provides the basis for development of sound management strategies. The general objective of this dissertation was to study two behaviors that make <b>foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> very successful as plant pests: desiccation tolerance and alternative feeding on fungi (or facultative feeding on the plant). To study the molecular basis of these behaviors, I used a transcriptomic approach complemented with in vitro and greenhouse experiments.

5000|$|Agriculturally, <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> can {{be devastating}} to alfalfa and strawberry. Strawberry is a major crop in California where fruit {{production}} is valued over $523 million. <b>Foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> reduce fruit and plant yield because they feed on the leaves, crowns, and flower buds of the strawberry plant. [...] Ornamental plants are also a multi-million dollar industry in the United States, and <b>foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> destroy these plants as well. In less severe cases of nematode infection, {{the appearance of the}} plant is affected by the symptoms of disease, which gives an undesirable appearance in ornamental plants. This reduces the value of the plant and makes most infected plants unmarketable. [...] It is difficult to quantitatively estimate the value of the amount of damage caused by nematodes because they are a persistent pathogen once they are introduced to the soil. However, in a multi-million dollar industry, any amount of yield loss could result in loss of millions of dollars’ worth of crop.|$|R
50|$|Presently, {{there are}} very few control options for plants infested with <b>foliar</b> <b>nematodes.</b> The current {{recommendations}} are to destroy infected plant material, and avoid using overhead irrigation {{to prevent the spread of}} nematodes to new plants.|$|R

40|$|<b>Foliar</b> <b>nematodes,</b> plant-parasitic {{representatives of}} the genus Aphelenchoides, {{constitute}} a minority in a group dominated by fungivorous species. Distinction between (mostly harmless) fungal feeding Aphelenchoides species and high impact plant parasites such as A. besseyi, A. fragariae, A. ritzemabosi, and A. subtenuis is severely hampered by the scarcity of informative morphological characters, {{some of which are}} only observable in specific developmental stages. Poor description of a number of non plant-parasitic Aphelenchoides species further complicates identification. Based on (nearly) full-length small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) sequences (˜ 1, 700 bp), a phylogenetic tree was generated, and the four target species appeared as distinct, well-supported groups. Notably, this genus does not constitute a monophyletic group: A. besseyi and A. ritzemabosi cluster together, and they are phylogenetically isolated from A. fragariae, A. subtenuis and other, most fungivorous species. A phylum-wide SSU rDNA framework was used to identify species-specific DNA motifs. For the molecular detection of four plant-parasitic Aphelenchoides species, PCR primers were developed with high, identical annealing temperatures (63 °C). Within the molecular framework presented here, these primers can be used for the rapid screening of plant material and soil for the presence of one or multiple <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> specie...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} causes for the {{increasing}} problem of <b>foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> in agriculture, greenhouse nurseries, and personal lawns, {{but there are}} no systemic nematicides available to growers due to the hazards they pose to people handling the plants. Advancements in plant breeding have enabled nurseries to produce more vegetative plants, which may cause infection of new plants via propagation from infected plants. Plants are also moved long distance to growers across the country and internationally, thus nematodes can easily spread to new areas where infection was previously not a problem.|$|R
30|$|On strawberry, A. fragariae causes malformations of {{the shoot}} such as {{twisting}} and puckering of leaves, discolored areas {{with a hard}} and rough surface, undersized leaves with crinkled edges, reddening of petioles, short internodes of runners, reduced flower trusses with {{only one or two}} flowers, and death of the crown bud (CABI 2018). Ectoparasitic feeding on folded crown and runner buds causes small dry, brown feeding areas which can be seen on expanded leaves usually near the midrib; occasionally, the nematodes are found in strawberry fruit pulp (Tacconi 1972). Endoparasitic feeding within leaf tissue produces typical leaf-blotch symptoms. The strawberry disease may be due wholly or partly to A. fragariae; sometimes, these symptoms could be due to other nematodes (A. ritzemabosi or Ditylenchus dipsaci) or caused by bacteria or frost (CABI 2018). These nematodes cause also distortion of the strawberry leaves. Damage by these nematodes is most noticeable on newly formed leaves soon after; growth is initiated in the spring (spring dwarf). However, symptoms may also become evident in the fall. Veins often act as barriers to <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> movement, so symptoms are often interveinal appearing as grayish spots that may turn brown. Leaves are often distorted. Eventually, <b>foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> are potentially destructive pathogens of strawberry. Experiments in Germany demonstrated Aphelenchoides sp. could reduce yields up to 65 % (Warner 2018).|$|R

Its biological cycle includes four life stages, three of which are juvenile. The nematode can undergo multiple life cycles in one growing season when favorable conditions are present. They can infect the crowns, runners, foliage, and new buds of the plant via stylet penetration or through the stomata.

We review studies documenting the outcome of cross-compartment interactions between these phytophage groups and show patterns of cross-compartment facilitation as well as cross-compartment induced resistance. Studies involving soilborne pathogens and <b>foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> are scant. We further highlight the important role of defense signaling loops between shoots and roots to activate a full resistance complement. Moreover, manipulation of such loops by phytophages affects systemic interactions with other plant feeders.

Abamectin at 0. 005 or 0. 011 g a. i. /liter (0. 3 or 0. 6 ml/liter Avid 0. 15 EC), diazinon at 0. 62 or 1. 87 g a. i. /liter (2. 6 or 7. 8 ml/liter KnoxOut GH), or methiocarb at 3. 5 g a. i. /liter (4. 7 g/liter Mesurol) were applied in two to six weekly or biweekly applications to foliage until runoff. Diazinon and abamectin reduced both A. fragariae and D. dipsaci populations in Lamium and Phlox, especially after repeated applications. Diazinon was generally more effective than abamectin. While methiocarb reduced A. fragariae densities in Lamium, it was not as efficacious as diazinon or abamectin. Nematode populations varied widely between host plant species and over time. Management of high nematode populations was difficult, and none of the materials tested was effective against A. fragariae in azalea or begonia.

Plants drenched with 90 °C water had lower numbers of nematode-infected leaves per plant than those treated with 25 °C and 70 °C water (P < 0. 05). Hot water treatments had no adverse effect on the growth parameters of hosta. Boiling water (100 °C) applied once a month for 3 consecutive months (April, May, June) consistently reduced the number of infected leaves and the severity of infection relative to the control 150 DAT in hosta but not in ferns (P < 0. 05). Boiling water (100 °C) caused a 67 % reduction in A. fragariae population in hosta leaves, 50 % in fern fronds, and 61 % to 98 % in the soil over the control 150 DAT. A boiling water drench had no effect on the fern growth but caused 49 % and 22 % reduction in the number and size of hosta leaves, respectively, over the control in 2002.

The nematodes overwintered as juveniles and adults in soil, dry leaves, and dormant buds, but not in roots. Nematode winter survival was higher in dormant buds and soil from the polyhouse than in an open home garden. Of the nematodes found in the dormant buds, 35 % to 79 % were located between the first two outside layers of the buds. The nematodes tolerated 8 hr exposure to 40 °C and − 80 °C in leaf tissues. Relative humidity influenced nematode migration from soil to leaves. The presence of nematodes only on the outer surface of foliage (leaves and petioles) confirmed the migration of A. fragariae {{on the surface of}} the plants. Of the total number of nematodes found on the foliage, 25 % to 46 % and 66 % to 77 % were alive at 90 % and 100 % relative humidity, respectively, suggesting that high moisture is required for the survival and upward movement of nematodes.
