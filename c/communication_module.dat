40|$|A design {{methodology}} {{is presented to}} support the design of VLSI circuits. The methodology {{is defined by the}} interface of basic modules and the way these modules are connected. The modules can be build hierarchically. The communication between parts of the circuit is supported by a small set of <b>communication</b> <b>modules.</b> Parallelism and pipelining are modelled with <b>communication</b> <b>modules.</b> The modules have to be carefully designed. A library of these modules can be used by inexperienced designers since thy can build a functional correct circuit without knowing the overall timing of the circuit. The methodology uses delay insensitive modules. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} Netgauge, an extensible open-source {{framework for}} implementing network benchmarks. The structure of Netgauge abstracts and explicitly separates communication patterns from <b>communication</b> <b>modules.</b> As {{a result of}} this separation of concerns, new benchmark types and new network protocols can be added independently to Netgauge. We describe the rich set of pre-defined communication patterns and <b>communication</b> <b>modules</b> that are available in the current distribution. Benchmark results demonstrate the applicability of the current Netgauge distribution to to different networks. An assortment of use-cases is used to investigate the implementation quality of selected protocols and protocol layers. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{communication}} system of Explorer AUV consists of surface communication subsystem and underwater communication subsystem, {{and the two}} are linked via acoustic <b>communication</b> <b>module,</b> which passed the information received from underwater communication computer and pass it on the central computer. The central control computer analyzes this information, including sending the compressed television imagery signals to imagery computer, which in turn, convert the information to display {{the image on the}} screen. The communication between the central control computer and positioning computer is achieved via RS-232 interface, while GPS information is received from the positioning computer via EIA-422 interface. In addition to sending the information to control the AUV, the central computer is also designed to communicate and interface the operating console on the mother ship when needed. The underwater {{communication system}} of Explorer AUV consists of two major components, the sonar controlling module and communication computer (via CPU). The sonar controlling module is tasked to control acoustic <b>communication</b> <b>module,</b> Doppler sonar, side-looking sonar, and other sonars, while communication computer is tasked to act as an interface between various onboard subsystems.|$|E
