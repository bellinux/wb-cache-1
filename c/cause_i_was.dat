6000|$|In {{the year}} 1878, {{the year of}} [...] "Peace with Honour," [...] I had walked as lone as any human being {{in the streets of}} London, out of Liverpool Street Station, to {{surrender}} myself to its care. And now, in the year of the war waged for honour and conscience more than for any other <b>cause,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there again, no longer alone, but a man of infinitely dear and close ties grown since that time, of work done, of words written, of friendships secured.

60|$|After the {{children}} were gone came a succession of calls; some from very aged people, the veterans of the old antislavery <b>cause.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> astonished and overwhelmed by the fervor of feeling some of them manifested; {{there seemed to be}} something almost prophetic in the enthusiasm with which they expressed their hope of our final success in America. This excitement, though very pleasant, was wearisome, and I was glad of an opportunity after dinner to rest myself, by rambling uninterrupted, with my friends, through the beautiful grounds of the Dingle.|$|E

60|$|These beds {{occur within}} the {{trachytic}} district, {{at the western}} base of Green Mountain, under which they dip at a high inclination. They are only partially exposed, being covered up by modern ejections; from this <b>cause,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> unable to trace their junction with the trachyte, or to discover whether they had flowed as a stream of lava, or had been injected amidst the overlying strata. There are three principal beds of obsidian, of which the thickest forms {{the base of the}} section. The alternating stony layers appear to me eminently curious, and shall be first described, and afterwards their passage into the obsidian. They have an extremely diversified appearance; five principal varieties may be noticed, but these insensibly blend into each other by endless gradations.|$|E
60|$|After an {{interval}} I arose, {{and as if}} by instinct, crawled into {{the room where the}} corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their <b>cause.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.|$|E
60|$|Probably {{the second}} failure-breeding fault, lack of perseverance, {{has its roots}} in the first, at any rate in my case. At least on leaving college with some reputation, I was called to the Bar where, owing to certain {{solicitor}} and other connections, I had a good opening. Also, owing to the excellence of my memory and powers of work, I began very well, making money even during my first year. Then, as it happened, a certain case came my way and, my leader falling ill suddenly after it was opened, was left in my hands. The man whose <b>cause</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> pleading was, I think, one of the biggest scoundrels it is possible to conceive. It was a will case and if he won, the effect would be to beggar two most estimable middle-aged women who were justly entitled to the property, to which end personally I am convinced he had committed forgery; the perjury that accompanied it I do not even mention.|$|E

60|$|I married. I {{found that}} there were greater forces at work than I had ever dreamed of. They took my husband away from me and molded him into the {{political}} lieutenant of my father. And I was without power. I could do nothing for the <b>cause.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> beaten. Then it was that I got a new vision. The future belonged to the children. There I could play my woman's part. I was a mother. Very well. I could do no better than to bring into the world a healthy son and bring him up to manhood healthy and wholesome, clean, noble, and alive. Did I do my part well, through him the results would be achieved. Through him would the work of the world be done in making the world healthier and happier for all the human creatures in it. I played the mother's part. That is why I left the pitiful little charities of the church and devoted myself to settlement work and tenement house reform, established my kindergartens, and worked for the little men and women who come so blindly and to whom the future belongs to make or mar.|$|E
60|$|I turned; and if I was not appalled to {{the same}} degree, as I return thanks to Heaven that I had not the <b>cause,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still startled by the sight that met my eyes. The form of a man stood upright on the cabin- hutch of the wrecked ship; his back was towards us; he {{appeared}} to be scanning the offing with shaded eyes, and his figure was relieved to its full height, which was plainly very great, against the sea and sky. I have said a thousand times that I am not superstitious; but at that moment, with my mind running upon death and sin, the unexplained appearance of a stranger on that sea-girt, solitary island filled me with a surprise that bordered close on terror. It seemed scarce possible that any human soul should have come ashore alive in such a sea as had rated last night along the coasts of Aros; and the only vessel within miles had gone down before our eyes among the Merry Men. I was assailed with doubts that made suspense unbearable, and, to put the matter to the touch at once, stepped forward and hailed the figure like a ship.|$|E

He is not here to defend himself against your uncourteous remarks; but, Monsieur le Duc, allow me to inform you that the fact that the person who insulted me paid for it almost with his life was no proof of his great want of skill, for monsieur my father will inform you, if you care to ask him, that had you stood opposite to my boy hero, the result would probably have been exactly the same; for, as I have often heard him say that this boy was fully a match for himself; I imagine that the chance of a nobleman who, with all his merits, has not, so far as I have heard, any great pretensions to special skill with his sword, would be slight indeed." ...|$|E
60|$|She withdrew her hand, yet left a {{lingering}} pressure, which I felt long afterwards. So intimately connected as I {{had been with}} perhaps {{the only man in}} whom she was ever truly interested, Zenobia looked on me as the representative of all the past, and was conscious that, in bidding me adieu, she likewise took final leave of Hollingsworth, and of this whole epoch of her life. Never did her beauty shine out more lustrously than in the last glimpse that I had of her. She departed, and was soon hidden among the trees. But, whether it was the strong impression of the foregoing scene, or whatever else the <b>cause,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> affected with a fantasy that Zenobia had not actually gone, but was still hovering about the spot and haunting it. I seemed to feel her eyes upon me. It was as if the vivid coloring of her character had left a brilliant stain upon the air. By degrees, however, the impression grew less distinct. I flung myself upon the fallen leaves at the base of Eliot's pulpit. The sunshine withdrew up the tree trunks and flickered on the topmost boughs; gray twilight made the wood obscure; the stars brightened out; the pendent boughs became wet with chill autumnal dews. But I was listless, worn out with emotion on my own behalf and sympathy for others, and had no heart to leave my comfortless lair beneath the rock.|$|E

60|$|When I {{heard that}} Nada, my daughter, still lived, I wept for joy, though like Umslopogaas I was torn by doubt and fear, {{for it is}} far for an unaided maid to travel from Swaziland to the Ghost Mountain. Yet all this while I said nothing to Umslopogaas of the truth as to his birth, because on the journey there were many around us, and the very trees have ears, and the same wind to which we whispered might whisper to the king. Still I knew that the hour had come now when I must speak, for {{it was in my}} mind to bring it about that Umslopogaas should be proclaimed the son of Chaka, and be made king of the Zulus in the place of Dingaan, his uncle. Yet all these things had gone cross for us, because it was fated so, my father. Had I known that Umslopogaas still lived when I slew Chaka, then I think that I could have brought it about that he should be king. Or had things fallen out as I planned, and the Lily maid been brought to Dingaan, and Umslopogaas grew great in his sight, then, perhaps, I could have brought it about. But all things had gone wrong. The Lily was none other than Nada; and how could Umslopogaas give Nada, whom he thought his sister, and who was my daughter, to Dingaan against her will? Also, because of Nada, Dingaan and Umslopogaas were now at bitter enmity, and for this same <b>cause</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> disgraced and a fugitive, and my counsels would no longer be heard in the ear of the king.|$|E

A more regular damnation! Is it a fact that artists, in general, are such wicked men? I never had the pleasure of knowing one, so I could n't confute her with an example. She had the advantage of me, because she formerly knew a portrait-painter at Richmond, who did her miniature in black lace mittens (you may see it on the parlor table), who used to drink raw brandy and beat his wife. I promised her that, whatever I might do to my wife, I would never beat my mother, and that as for brandy, raw or diluted, I detested it. She sat silently crying for an hour, during which I expended treasures of eloquence. It 's a good thing to have to reckon up one's intentions, and I assure you, as I pleaded my <b>cause,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> most agreeably impressed with the elevated character of my own.

6000|$|I {{was born}} in the kingdom of Fife, being, by some five years, the younger of two sons of Archibald Leslie, of Pitcullo, near St. Andrews, a cadet of the great House of Rothes. My mother was an Englishwoman of the Debatable Land, a Storey of Netherby, and of me, in our country speech, it used to be said that I was [...] "a mother's bairn." [...] For I had ever my {{greatest}} joy in her, whom I lost ere I was sixteen years of age, and she in me: not that she favoured me unduly, for she was very just, but that, within ourselves, we each knew who was nearest to her heart. She was, indeed, a saintly woman, yet of a merry wit, and she had great pleasure in reading of books, and in romances. Being always, when I might, in her company, I became a clerk insensibly, and without labour I could early read and write, wherefore my father was minded to bring me up for a churchman. For this <b>cause,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> some deal despised by others of my age, and, yet more, because from my mother I had caught the Southron trick of the tongue. They called me [...] "English Norman," [...] and many a battle I have fought on that quarrel, for I am as true a Scot as any, and I hated the English (my own mother's people though they were) for taking and holding captive our King, James I. of worthy memory. My fancy, like that of most boys, was all for the wars, and full of dreams concerning knights and ladies, dragons and enchanters, about which the other lads were fain enough to hear me tell what I had read in romances, though they mocked at me for reading. Yet they oft came ill speed with their jests, for my brother had taught me to use my hands: and to hold a sword I was instructed by our smith, who had been prentice to Harry Gow, the Burn-the- Wind of Perth, and the best man at his weapon in broad Scotland. From him I got many a trick of fence that served my turn later.|$|E
