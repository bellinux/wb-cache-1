Moro and Zorrilla were sentenced to 25 and 35 years in prison respectively, but were released from prison in February 2009 for good conduct after serving {{at least half of}} their sentences. Several public intellectuals, journalists, press freedom organizations, newspapers, and politicians protested their releases. Zorrilla returned to prison later that year after he failed to provide a formal letter petitioning his release. On 10 September 2013, Zorrilla was released from prison after a Mexico City judge granted him the opportunity to fulfill the remaining years of his sentence at his residence due to unstable health conditions. The Mexican government closed the case after the arrests, but many journalists doubted the results of the investigation and believed that the masterminds behind the murder case remained at large.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} reforms of President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> de Gortari {{had a tremendous}} effect on the city, {{as a number of}} businesses, including banks and airlines, were privatized. He also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

By contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city.|$|E

At the beginning, it was given the task of defining federal policies to strengthen service providers through technical assistance and financial resources. CONAGUA, among other suggestions soon recommended to strengthen the decentralization process, improve the transparency of tariffs and introduce tariff autonomy, based on real costs for the service provision and free of political influence. Consequently, many water laws were introduced or amended, partly following CONAGUA's guidelines. In 1996, 21 states had transferred service provision to municipal service providers.|$|E
25|$|Canada's Brian Mulroney {{not only}} ran {{on a similar}} {{platform}} but also favored closer trade ties with the United States.

Mexican presidents Miguel de la Madrid, in the early 1980s and <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> de Gortari in the late 1980s, started implementing liberal economic strategies that were seen as a good move. However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. In the United States president Ronald Reagan attempted to move the United States back towards a hard anti-communist line in foreign affairs, in what his supporters saw {{as an attempt to}} assert moral leadership (compared to the Soviet Union) in the world community.

25|$|He {{became a}} member of the Democratic {{leadership}} as a deputy majority whip, where he became friends with Bill Clinton after they worked closely on several issues, including when he served as the ranking House Democrat in favor of NAFTA's passage in 1993. For his work as a back channel to <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> de Gortari, Mexico's president at the time of the negotiations, he was awarded the Aztec Eagle Award, Mexico's highest award for a foreigner. Clinton in turn sent Richardson on various foreign policy missions, including a trip in 1996 in which Richardson traveled to Baghdad with Peter Bourne and engaged in lengthy one-on-one negotiations with Saddam Hussein to secure the release of two American aerospace workers who had been captured by the Iraqis after wandering over the Kuwaiti border. Richardson also visited Nicaragua, Guatemala, Cuba, Peru, India, North Korea, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Sudan to represent U.S. interests and met with Slobodan Milošević. In 1996 he played a major role in securing the release of American Evan Hunziker from North Korean custody and for securing a pardon for Eliadah McCord, an American convicted and imprisoned in Bangladesh. Due to these missions, Richardson was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the last}} straw {{may have been the}} {{controversial}} elections of 1988.

The vast literature that characterizes him as a ruthless tyrant and dictator has its origins in the late period of Díaz's rule and has continued to shape Díaz's historical image. In recent years, however, Díaz's legacy has been re-evaluated by Mexican historians, most prominently by Enrique Krauze, {{in what has been}} termed [...] "Neo-Porfirismo". As Mexico pursued a neoliberal path under President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> de Gortari, the modernizing policies of Díaz that opened Mexico up to foreign investment fit with the new pragmatism of the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

2500|$|When the Gulf Cartel {{was moving}} tons of cocaine to the United States and moving {{millions}} of dollars in cash along the border in the 1970s, Juan García Ábrego decided that he needed more protection.

His former friends and associates mentioned that the drug lord was paying one of <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> de Gortari's deputy attorneys general more than $1.5 million a month for his protection. He is allegedly reported to have been protected by a large private army of gunmen.

2500|$|Throughout {{most of the}} 20th century, the Mexican peso {{remained}} one of {{the more}} stable currencies in Latin America, since the economy did not experience periods of hyperinflation common to other countries in the region. However, after the oil crisis of the late 1970s, Mexico defaulted on its external debt in 1982, and as a result the country suffered a severe case of capital flight, followed by several years of inflation and devaluation, until a government economic strategy called the [...] "Stability and Economic Growth Pact" [...] (Pacto de estabilidad y crecimiento económico, PECE) was adopted under President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas.</b> On January 1, 1993 the Bank of Mexico introduced a new currency, the nuevo peso ("new peso", or MXN), written [...] "N$" [...] followed by the numerical amount.

2500|$|During the {{administration}} of Mexican President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> de Gortari (1988–1994), the government tried to exercise its power against Unomásuno and other media outlets after a contested general election. The government told Becerra Acosta, {{the head of the}} newspaper, that if he remained in Mexico he would be imprisoned for tax evasion. There were editorial and personal factors that led to this decision. Becerra Acosta and Unomásuno were the first to publish the existence of the Democratic Current (...) , a leftist faction within the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) that eventually broke away from the party and formed the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), headed by Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, in 1989. In addition, Unomásuno published several articles on the Manuel Buendía case, an investigative journalist who was murdered in 1984. The publications criticized the government for trying to cover-up the investigation and for its determination to close the case.|$|E
