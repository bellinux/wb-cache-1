5000|$|Various {{approaches}} {{have been applied}} to study the structure, dynamics and functioning of <b>chaperones.</b> Bulk biochemical measurements have informed us on the protein folding efficiency, and prevention of aggregation when <b>chaperones</b> are present during protein folding.

50|$|<b>Chaperones,</b> {{also called}} {{molecular}} <b>chaperones,</b> are proteins that assist other proteins in assuming their three-dimensional fold, which {{is necessary for}} protein function. However, the fold of a protein is sensitive to environmental conditions, such as temperature and pH, and thus <b>chaperones</b> are needed to keep proteins in their functional fold across various environmental conditions. <b>Chaperones</b> {{are an integral part}} of a cell's protein quality control network by assisting in protein folding and are ubiquitous across diverse biological taxa. Since protein folding, and therefore protein function, is susceptible to environmental conditions, <b>chaperones</b> could represent an important cellular aspect of biodiversity and environmental tolerance by organisms living in hazardous conditions. <b>Chaperones</b> also affect the evolution of proteins in general, as many proteins fundamentally require <b>chaperones</b> to fold or are naturally prone to misfolding, and therefore mitigates protein aggregation.|$|R
40|$|Accumulation {{of toxic}} {{proteins}} in neurons {{has been linked}} {{with the onset of}} neurodegenerative diseases, which in many cases are characterized by altered neuronal function and synapse loss. Molecular <b>chaperones</b> help protein folding and the resolubilization of unfolded proteins, thereby reducing the protein aggregation stress. While most of the <b>chaperones</b> are expressed in neurons, their functional relevance remains largely unknown. Here, using bioinformatics analysis, we identified 95 Drosophila <b>chaperones</b> and classified them into seven different classes. Ubiquitous actin 5 C-Gal 4 -mediated RNAi knockdown revealed that ∼ 50 % of the <b>chaperones</b> are essential in Drosophila. Knocking down these genes in eyes revealed that ∼ 30 % of the essential <b>chaperones</b> are crucial for eye development. Using neuron-specific knockdown, immunocytochemistry, and robust behavioral assays, we identified a new set of <b>chaperones</b> that play critical roles in the regulation of Drosophila NMJ structural organization. Together, our data present the first classification and comprehensive analysis of Drosophila <b>chaperones.</b> Our screen identified a new set of <b>chaperones</b> that regulate eye and NMJ morphogenesis. The outcome of the screen reported here provides a useful resource for further elucidating the role of individual <b>chaperones</b> in Drosophila eye morphogenesis and synaptic development...|$|R

5|$|Non-inhibitory {{extracellular}} serpins also {{perform a}} wide array of important roles. Thyroxine-binding globulin and transcortin transport the hormones thyroxine and cortisol, respectively. The non-inhibitory serpin ovalbumin is the most abundant protein in egg white. Its exact function is unknown, but it is thought to be a storage protein for the developing foetus. Heat shock serpin 47 is a <b>chaperone,</b> essential for proper folding of collagen. It acts by stabilising collagen's triple helix whilst it is being processed in the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E

A dynamical Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the translocation of a stiff homopolymer through a nanopore driven by <b>chaperones.</b> <b>Chaperones</b> are proteins that bind to the polymer near the wall and prevent its backsliding through Cis side. The important parameters include binding energy, size and the local concentration of the <b>chaperones.</b> The profile of these local concentrations, build up the <b>chaperones</b> distribution. Here we investigate the effects of binding energy, size and the exponential distribution of <b>chaperones</b> in their equilibration in {{each step of the}} polymer translocation needed for stable translocation time. The simulation results show that in case of <b>chaperones</b> with the size of a monomer (λ= 1) and/or positive effective binding energy and/or uniform distribution, the <b>chaperones</b> binding equilibration rate/frequency is less than 5 times per monomer. However, in some special cases in the exponential distribution of <b>chaperones</b> with size λ> 1 and negative effective binding energy the equilibration rate will diverge to more than 20 times per monomer. We show that this non-equilibrium effect results in supper diffusion, seen before. Moreover, we confirm the equilibration process theoretically...|$|R

Molecular <b>chaperones</b> also participate in hemoglobin synthesis, both directly and indirectly. Current knowledge in these areas only scratches the surface of {{what is to be}} learned. Improved understanding of how molecular <b>chaperones</b> regulate erythropoietic development and hemoglobin homeostasis should identify biochemical pathways amenable to pharmacologic manipulation in a variety of red blood cell disorders including thalassemia and other anemias associated with hemoglobin instability...|$|R
50|$|Many <b>chaperones</b> are {{heat shock}} {{proteins}}, that is, proteins expressed {{in response to}} elevated temperatures or other cellular stresses. The reason for this behaviour is that protein folding is severely affected by heat and, therefore, some <b>chaperones</b> act to prevent or correct damage caused by misfolding. Other <b>chaperones</b> are involved in folding newly made proteins as they are extruded from the ribosome. Although most newly synthesized proteins can fold in absence of <b>chaperones,</b> a minority strictly requires them for the same.|$|R

5|$|Serpins are {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} and largest superfamily of protease inhibitors. They were initially believed to be restricted to eukaryote organisms, but have since been found in bacteria, archaea and some viruses. It remains unclear whether prokaryote genes are the descendants of an ancestral prokaryotic serpin or the product of horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes. Most intracellular serpins belong to a single phylogenetic clade, whether they come from plants or animals, indicating that the intracellular and extracellular serpins may have diverged before the plants and animals. Exceptions include the intracellular heat shock serpin HSP47, which is a <b>chaperone</b> essential for proper folding of collagen, and cycles between the cis-Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Chaperones</b> are a {{class of}} {{proteins}} that aid in the correct folding of other proteins in vivo. <b>Chaperones</b> exist in all cellular compartments and interact with the polypeptide chain {{in order to allow}} the native three-dimensional conformation of the protein to form; however, <b>chaperones</b> themselves are not included in the final structure of the protein they are assisting in. <b>Chaperones</b> may assist in folding even when the nascent polypeptide is being synthesized by the ribosome. Molecular <b>chaperones</b> operate by binding to stabilize an otherwise unstable structure of a protein in its folding pathway, but <b>chaperones</b> do not contain the necessary information to know the correct native structure of the protein they are aiding; rather, <b>chaperones</b> work by preventing incorrect folding conformations. In this way, <b>chaperones</b> do not actually increase the rate of individual steps involved in the folding pathway toward the native structure; instead, they work by reducing possible unwanted aggregations of the polypeptide chain that might otherwise slow down the search for the proper intermediate and they provide a more efficient pathway for the polypeptide chain to assume the correct conformations. <b>Chaperones</b> are {{not to be confused with}} folding catalysts, which actually do catalyze the otherwise slow steps in the folding pathway. Examples of folding catalysts are protein disulfide isomerases and peptidyl-prolyl isomerases that may be involved in formation of disulfide bonds or interconversion between cis and trans stereoisomers, respectively. <b>Chaperones</b> are shown to be critical in the process of protein folding in vivo because they provide the protein with the aid needed to assume its proper alignments and conformations efficiently enough to become [...] "biologically relevant". This means that the polypeptide chain could theoretically fold into its native structure without the aid of <b>chaperones,</b> as demonstrated by protein folding experiments conducted in vitro; however, this process proves to be too inefficient or too slow to exist in biological systems; therefore, <b>chaperones</b> are necessary for protein folding in vivo. Along with its role in aiding native structure formation, <b>chaperones</b> are shown to be involved in various roles such as protein transport, degradation, and even allow denatured proteins exposed to certain external denaturant factors an opportunity to refold into their correct native structures.|$|R

50|$|Chemical <b>chaperones</b> are a {{class of}} small {{molecules}} that function to enhance the folding and/or stability of proteins.

40|$|<b>Chaperones</b> are {{the primary}} {{regulators}} of the proteostasis network and are known to facilitate protein folding, inhibit protein aggregation, and promote disaggregation and clearance of misfolded aggregates inside cells. We have tested the effects of five <b>chaperones</b> on the toxicity of misfolded oligomers preformed from three different proteins added extracellularly to cultured cells. All the <b>chaperones</b> were found to decrease oligomer toxicity significantly, even at very low chaperone/protein molar ratios, provided that they were added extracellularly rather than being overexpressed in the cytosol. Infrared spectroscopy and site-directed labeling experiments using pyrene ruled out structural reorganizations within the discrete oligomers. Rather, confocal microscopy, SDS-PAGE, and intrinsic fluorescence measurements indicated tight binding between oligomers and <b>chaperones.</b> Moreover, atomic force microscopy imaging indicated that larger assemblies of oligomers are formed {{in the presence of}} the <b>chaperones.</b> This suggests that the <b>chaperones</b> bind to the oligomers and promote their assembly into larger species, with consequent shielding of the reactive surfaces and a decrease in their diffusional mobility. Overall, the data indicate a generic ability of <b>chaperones</b> to neutralize extracellular misfolded oligomers efficiently and reveal that further assembly of protein oligomers into larger species can be an effective strategy to neutralize such extracellular species...|$|R
