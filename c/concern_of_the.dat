5|$|In mid-1940, the {{principal}} <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Air Force, together with {{elements of the}} Fleet Air Arm, was to contest the control of British airspace with the German Luftwaffe. For the Germans, achieving at least local air superiority was an essential prerequisite to any invasion.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a primary}} <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead {{relied on the}} first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E
5|$|Another major <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was {{vital to the}} state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, reactionary {{conspiracy}} theorists, such as Scottish physicist John Robison and French Jesuit priest Augustin Barruel, began speculating that the Illuminati had survived their suppression {{and become the}} masterminds behind the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. The Illuminati were accused of being subversives who were attempting to secretly orchestrate a revolutionary wave in Europe {{and the rest of}} the world in order to spread the most radical ideas and movements of the Enlightenment—anti-clericalism, anti-monarchism, and anti-patriarchalism—and to create a world noocracy and cult of reason. During the 19th century, fear of an Illuminati conspiracy was a real <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European ruling classes, and their oppressive reactions to this unfounded fear provoked in 1848 the very revolutions they sought to prevent.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 1873, {{the state}} {{legislature}} passed a bill re-enfranchising ex-Confederates, {{to the delight of}} much of the state population and the <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Minstrels. The legislature called a special election in November to replace 33 members, mostly Minstrels, who had left for patronage jobs in the Baxter government. Baxter refused to let the Minstrels manipulate the election, declaring that free, honest elections would be held during his term. With the help of the newly re-enfranchised voters, conservative Democrats swept the election and gained a small majority in the legislature. Baxter was about to erode his Republican base out from under him.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the dam project also {{arose in}} <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dam's cost. Several United States congressmen and fiscal conservatives protested the {{proposal}} {{on the grounds}} that the money that would be spent on its construction would be better used to support other projects. They pointed to the lack of existing infrastructure in the region and said it was unlikely that enough electricity generated by the dam could be sold at a high enough price to pay for its construction.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet counter-offensive, Operation Uranus, {{broke the}} thinly-held German flanks on 19 November; by 22 November, the encirclement of the 6th Army was complete. The <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{propaganda}} organisations, both military and civilian, {{was how to}} present this military disaster to the public. Initially, every {{effort was made to}} hide the true scope of the events from the population. The communiqués published between 19 and 24 November merely mentioned the Soviet attack in the southern sector of the East front, not addressing the extent of Wehrmacht's difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chronicle was the {{acquisition}} of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The Liber {{was used by the}} monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate. The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 15, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for the Big Island of Hawaii, meaning gale force winds were possible within 36 hours; concurrently, a high surf advisory was put into effect for all eastward facing shorelines. By late on August 15, the CPHC issued a hurricane watch for {{the entire state of}} Hawaii. Early the next day, the CPHC upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the Big Island of Hawaii, as Fernanda was expected to continue its westward track. When the hurricane slowed, its movement was uncertain, although all watches and warnings were canceled by August 17, when Fernanda began its northwest track. Officials opened nine shelters on the Big Island, and about 200 people stayed in them until the hurricane watches were canceled. One shelter near Hilo held 80 people due to <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high waves. Officials on the Big Island closed and evacuated all of the beach parks on August 15. On Molokai, 40 hikers were evacuated from a valley prone to flooding. Residents bought emergency supplies on Kauai, which had been struck by powerful Hurricane Iniki 11 months prior.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} between 1993 till 1996, the Cambodian defence {{ministry}} attempted to integrate the different factions together, but were unsuccessful. In a dossier written by Nhek Bun Chhay around mid-1997, there were 80,800 pro-FUNCINPEC troops, which were divided into 11 battalions across the country. Nhek also express <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inferior troop strength of the pro-FUNCINPEC forces, as they were slightly outnumbered compared to 90,000 pro-CPP troops. In November 1996, armed skirmishes occurred between RCAF troops separately aligned to CPP and FUNCINPEC, after a pro-CPP general, Keo Pong accused a pro-FUNCINPEC general, Serey Kosal of attempting to kill him, who in turn accused Keo Pong of recruiting Khmer Rouge defectors into his ranks. More armed skirmishes broke out until February 1997, leaving 14 pro-CPP and 2 pro-FUNCINPEC troops wounded. Subsequently, Ke Kim Yan, the chief-of-staff of the RCAF stepped in to meditate the conflict, and a directive was issued to prohibit movement of troops without the explicit permission of the government. In late March 1997, the two co-defense ministers, Tea Banh of the CPP and Tea Chamrath of FUNCINPEC, together with Ke Kim Yan and Nhek Bun Chhay formed a bipartisan defence committee was formed to prevent the RCAF from getting embroiled into the political conflict between Ranariddh and Hun Sen.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} {{factions of}} the sejm were divided between liberals, supporting the German constitutional movement, and conservatives, like Edward Raczyński, who predicted that this movement would abolish the Grand Duchy's autonomy. During {{the two or}} so decades of its existence, the major issues of <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sejm were the abolition of serfdom and relations between the inhabitants of Polish and German ethnicity, particularly the discrimination against the Poles by the Prussian government, which increasingly excluded the Polish majority from administration and judiciary. The last petition issued by the Sejm in 1841 demanded equal rights for the Poles and stopping of the Germanization campaign. As most of the Sejm petitions were simply ignored by the King of Prussia, this contributed to dissent in the province, which eventually resulted in an uprising in 1848 {{in the midst of}} the revolutions of 1848 in the German states. The Sejm met the total of seven times before the revolutions of 1848 (in 1827, 1830, 1834, 1837, 1841, 1843 and 1845). Following the revolutions, the Sejm of the Grand Duchy, like other provincial Prussian assemblies, gained the right to elect deputies to the Prussian Parliament. The Sejm continued its sessions till 1918, with a total of 49 Sejms being held.|$|E
5|$|The waters around Svalbard are of {{strategic}} significance for Russia as the Northern Fleet must {{pass through the}} area to reach the Atlantic Ocean. The <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union and Russia was therefore to ensure that listening stations and anti-submarine warfare installations were not placed on the archipelago. Except during the Second World War, Norway has never stationed any military troops on Svalbard. However, the Norwegian Coast Guard carries out surveillance. There were many protests during the Cold War from the Soviet Union against Norwegian activity on the island, including purely civil arrangements. The Soviet Union issued many memorandums protesting such installations as satellite ground stations and airports, and even the filming of Orion's Belt, {{on the grounds that}} it could be a cover for or had the potential for being used for military activities.|$|E

5|$|While the Commission is the {{executive}} branch, the candidates are chosen individually by the 28 national governments, which means {{it is not possible}} for a Commission Member or its President to be removed by a direct election. Rather, the legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the <b>concern</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no elections for the position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.|$|E

50|$|Accordingly, the {{provisional}} government, supposedly created to address <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> classes <b>of</b> French society, had little {{support among the}} working classes and petit bourgeoisie. Therefore, it tended to address only <b>the</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liberal bourgeoisie. Support for {{the provisional}} government was especially weak in the countryside, which was predominantly agricultural and more conservative, and had its own concerns, such as food shortages due to bad harvests. <b>The</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bourgeoisie were very different from those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower classes.
