According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, this proposal is just a personal vision {{of the air force}} commander. The fleet expansion is not on the agenda for years to <b>come.</b> <b>More</b> recently, the air force decided to upgrade its fleet to the MS20 configuration.|$|E

From early medieval period <b>come</b> <b>more</b> than 100 settlements identified in the Sălaj County (7th–13th centuries). Among the first counties organized in Transylvania was Crasna County, in 1090, part of the current Sălaj County.|$|E
25|$|Babies feed {{differently}} {{with artificial}} nipples {{than from a}} breast. With the breast, the infant's tongue massages the milk out rather than sucking, and the nipple does not go as far into the mouth. Drinking from a bottle takes less effort and the milk may <b>come</b> <b>more</b> rapidly, potentially causing the baby to lose desire for the breast. This is called nursing strike, nipple strike or nipple confusion. To avoid this, expressed milk can be given by means such as spoons or cups.|$|E

Fifteen men came to his first public meeting in April 1819. He was encouraged but suspected they had <b>come</b> <b>more</b> out of curiosity than anything else. Their attention wandered, and they soon seemed uninterested. Two months later, he baptized his first Burmese convert, Maung Naw, a 35-year-old timber worker from the hill tribes.|$|E

Her volleys tend to <b>come</b> <b>more</b> from her forehand, her stronger side, which she executes by moving her racket {{in a straight}} line, also allowing her to disguise the shot well enough from her opponents. In the slice department, she {{has the ability to}} keep the ball low and performs the shot better on her backhand wing. Due to her tall frame, she is known to make up for her lack of speed by playing close to the baseline. Her game suits the fast courts and she cites grass as her favourite surface.|$|E
25|$|Tourism is {{the most}} {{important}} sector in the park and has the largest potential to be a source for sustainable income. Rila Monastery Nature park is the second most visited nature park in Bulgaria after Vitosha, which is situated next to the nation's capital Sofia. Around 96% of all adult Bulgarians have visited the Rila Monastery at least once; of them 60% have <b>come</b> <b>more</b> than twice. In 2008 the park was visited by 1,002,204 people. Of them, approximately 1/3 are foreign citizens. More than 2/3 of the visitors come to the park for a one-day trip without staying overnight. Around 90% of all tourists visit the monastery. Half of the tourists arrive in two of the summer months, July and August. More than 2/3 arrive by car via the III-107 third class road, the park's only highway access; the rest come by foot from Rila National Park.|$|E

500|$|Regarding eschatology (a {{branch of}} {{theology}} {{concerned with the}} final events {{in the history of}} the world or of humankind), Churches of Christ are generally amillennial, their originally prevalent postmillennialism (evident in Alexander Campbell's Millennial Harbinger) having dissipated around the era of the First World War. Before then, many leaders were [...] "moderate historical premillennialists" [...] who did not advocate specific historical interpretations. Churches of Christ have moved away from premillennialism as dispensational millennialism has <b>come</b> <b>more</b> to fore in Protestant evangelical circles. [...] Amillennialism and postmillennialism are the prevailing views today.|$|E
500|$|Nixon's {{speech was}} {{seen or heard}} by about 60 million Americans, {{including}} the largest television audience to that time, and led to an outpouring of public support. [...] A huge majority {{of the millions of}} telegrams and phone calls received by the RNC and other political offices supported Nixon. He was retained on the ticket, which then swept to victory weeks later in November 1952. The Checkers speech was an early example of a politician using television to appeal directly to the electorate, but has since sometimes been mocked or denigrated. Checkers speech has <b>come</b> <b>more</b> generally to mean any emotional speech by a politician.|$|E
500|$|Kulintang {{music can}} be used for {{communicating}} long distance messages from one village or longhouse to another. Called apad, these renditions mimic the normal speaking tones of the Maguindanao language, creating a specific message or, through the use of double entendre, a social commentary understood by nearly any adult native Maguindanao speaker. However, apad is falling into disuse because times have changed, and the necessity of its use for long-distance communication purposes has faded away. [...] Anun as a music without a message, is used instead to express sentiments and feelings, and has <b>come</b> <b>more</b> and more into use due to its compatibility with the musical elaborations and idiosyncratic styles of the times.|$|E

It also won Best Foreign Song at the 2010 Croatian Porin Awards.

On the occasion of Beyoncé's thirtieth birthday, Erika Ramirez and Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine placed the ballad at number 18 on their list of Beyoncé's 30 biggest Billboard hits. On The Village Voice year-end Pazz & Jop singles list, [...] "Halo" [...] was ranked at numbers 443 and 114 in 2008 and 2009 respectively. In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the song at number three on their list of ten best Beyoncé's songs writing that other power ballads [...] "don't <b>come</b> <b>more</b> powerful than this one, which finds Beyoncé belting alongside what sounds to be every instrument in the entire world (including a dope one-second drum solo)".

500|$|When Longacre {{completed}} the double eagle dies, they were rejected by Peale, who {{stated that the}} design was engraved too deeply to fully impress the coin, and the pieces would not stack properly. [...] Taxay, however, noted that the one surviving 1849 double eagle displays no such problems, and by appearance would be level in a stack. Peale complained to Patterson, who wrote to Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith asking for Longacre's removal on December 25, 1849 on the ground he could not make proper dies. [...] Patterson that day promised the position to engraver Charles Cushing Wright, effective when Longacre was ousted. [...] Meredith questioned whether a competent replacement could be found; Patterson assured him that one could. [...] Longacre objected to Patterson that Peale was delaying acceptance of revised double eagle dies, the director did not reply in writing, but met with Longacre, told him the administration had decided to terminate him, {{and that he should}} send in his resignation without delay. [...] Longacre, after thinking the matter over, did not do so, but instead went to Washington on February 12, 1850 to meet with Meredith. [...] He found that the secretary had been lied to about a number of matters. [...] According to Snow, Longacre did not seek retribution, content to be allowed to continue his work in peace. [...] The double eagle went into production in March 1850, though Patterson complained that the coins did not strike well. [...] The double eagle quickly became the favored way [...] to hold gold, and in the years to <b>come</b> <b>more</b> gold would be struck into double eagles than into all other denominations combined.|$|E

2500|$|A {{negawatt}} is a unit in {{watts of}} energy saved. It {{is basically the}} opposite of a watt. Amory Lovins has advocated a [...] "negawatt revolution", arguing that utility customers don’t want kilowatt-hours of electricity; they want energy services such as hot showers, cold beer, lit rooms, and spinning shafts, which can <b>come</b> <b>more</b> cheaply if electricity is used more efficiently.|$|E
2500|$|Sue Ellen Ewing left in {{the season}} twelve finale, to move to London with her new husband, film {{director}} Don Lockwood (guest star Ian McShane).

2500|$|All {{the people}} who come, as in times past, to the feast of Toci, come on the pretext of Saint Ann, but since the word [...] is ambiguous, and they respect the olden ways, it is {{believable}} that they <b>come</b> <b>more</b> for the ancient than the modern. And thus, also in this place, idolatry appears to be cloaked {{because so many people}} come from such distant lands without Saint Ann's ever having performed any miracles there. It is more apparent that it is the ancient Toci rather than Saint Ann [...]|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{have also}} pointed out that the show lacks visual punch. People interviewed in the show declare that they [...] "feel" [...] a spirit next to them, but nothing is shown to the TV viewer. In the series debut, the {{audience}} is told that a young boy sees ghosts, but the audience is not able to see any evidence of this. [...] "The most compelling footage seems to <b>come</b> <b>more</b> from the editing room than beyond the grave", noted one industry trade publication. Reviewers say the show also fails to effectively integrate and utilize the team's (apparently) sophisticated audio and video equipment to heighten tension or help support their claims of paranormal activity.|$|E
2500|$|The gault {{clay and}} the middle chalk that lies under the North Downs are both at their {{thickest}} around the valley that occupies the centre of Caterham Valley. [...] While earlier cretaceous clays and greensand and sandy material, underlying, is evident where terrain has eroded, 90 million years ago the North Downs hard chalk was deposited, a white limestone comprising over 95% calcium carbonate. It contains thin beds of marl and nodules of flint, either scattered or in bands. The North Downs extending from Farnham to Dover are formed by this chalk. They now have an often white, almost vertical south-facing slope. [...] In lower slopes flints washed up by early seas <b>come</b> <b>more</b> {{to the surface and}} appear closer to the surface.|$|E
2500|$|When again nothing took place, {{predictions}} regressed {{to their}} earlier short-term orientation.

The human mind seems to have a natural tendency, and one with which we should have sympathy, to expect matters to culminate more rapidly, fulfillments to <b>come</b> <b>more</b> suddenly, than they ever do come ... Studying God's Word, we have measured the 2520 years, the Seven symbolic Times, from that year 606 B.C. and have found that it reached down to October, 1914, as nearly as we were able to reckon. We did not say positively that this would be the year. We merely left every one to look at the facts of history and reckon for himself." ...|$|E
