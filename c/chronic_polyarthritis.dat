5000|$|In 1991, George Kollias' {{group was}} first to provide in vivo, proof of {{principle}} studies, on deregulated TNF production being causal {{to the development of}} <b>chronic</b> <b>polyarthritis</b> in a transgenic animal model, and for showing originally that anti-huTNF antibody treatment was efficacious in treating the modeled disease (pg. 370 [...] ). These studies were instrumental in mobilizing the interest of anti-TNF industry and foreshadowed the success of the first clinical trials performed in RA in 1994. Further work in his lab provided insights into the function of TNF in host defense and the structure and function of secondary lymphoid organs, a work that more recently evolved into the establishment of TNFRI and NFkB signals specifically in follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) being of pivotal significance in the regulation of humoral B cell responses and autoimmunity. Moreover, George Kollias' group demonstrated TNF’s causal effect in the development of combined Crohn's disease and polyarthritis, and the contribution of transmembrane versus soluble TNF in the pathogenic processes. These studies offered {{a better understanding of the}} physiological function of TNF in health and disease and rationalized potential complications or optimizations of anti-TNF therapies in other diseases such as in MS. More recently, George Kollias introduced a novel pathogenic principle to explain the cellular basis of TNF function in gut/joint axis diseases, including spondyloarthropathies, by showing that mesenchymal cells, namely synovial fibroblasts and intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts, are common pathogenic targets of TNF sufficient to drive the chronic inflammatory and destructive disease process. Animal models developed in his lab have been distributed to numerous academic and industrial laboratories around the world (over 200 MTAs in the last ten years). In 2005 he founded the first CRO-biotech spin-off of BSRC Fleming, Biomedcode Hellas SA.|$|E

40|$|Objective. Type II {{collagen}} (CII) -specific B cell responses {{have been}} recognized in human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). An important limitation of the CIA model is that the CII response and the disease are stimulated by exogenously injected collagen.

This study was undertaken to create a new model of <b>chronic</b> autoimmune <b>polyarthritis</b> and characterize the associated CII-specific B cell response. Methods. Secondary challenge with OVA or CII in adjuvant was used to elicit chronic disease. CII-specific B cell responses against the epitopes U 1, J 1, C 1, and citrullinated C 1, together with the antibody affinity, were investigated in OVA-mediated arthritis. Results. <b>Chronic</b> autoimmune <b>polyarthritis</b> was induced and was dependent on the antigen used in the secondary challenge. U 1 was the major CII epitope recognized, and antibodies showed the same affinity as those in CIA. Conclusion. Our findings indicate that the development and severity of chronic disease is dependent on the antigen and is associated with an increased autoreactive B cell response directed against a specific CII epitope (U 1).

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>chronic</b> <b>polyarthritis</b> in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) and to describe the manifestations, treatments, and outcomes in these patients. Methods: From January 1983 to July 2010, 5419 patients were followed up at the Pediatric Rheumatology Unit of the University Hospital and 271 (5 %) of them had JSLE (American College of Rheumatology [ACR] criteria). `Rhupus` was classified as the overlap of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (International League of Associations for Rheumatology [ILAR] criteria) and JSLE. We evaluated demographic data, polyarthritis and other clinical manifestations, disease activity and damage, laboratory exams, radiographic findings, treatments, and outcomes. Results: The prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>polyarthritis</b> in this JSLE population was 2. 6 % (7 / 271). This articular involvement was the initial manifestation in all seven JSLE patients. The median duration of <b>chronic</b> <b>polyarthritis</b> was 11 months (range 2 - 15 months). Interestingly, rhupus with <b>chronic</b> <b>polyarthritis</b> and limitation of movement, presence of rheumatoid factor, autoantibodies, and/or radiographic abnormalities (juxtaarticular osteopenia, joint-space narrowing, or erosions) was evidenced in three patients. No patient had deformities of hands and feet associated with Jaccoud`s arthropathy or osteonecrosis. All patients were treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, naproxen 10 - 15 mg/kg/day) when polyarthritis diagnosis was established. Prednisone and antimalarials were administered at JSLE diagnosis. The three non-responsive rhupus patients were treated in conjunction with immunosuppressive drugs (methotrexate, azathioprine, and/or cyclosporine). Conclusions: <b>Chronic</b> <b>polyarthritis</b> was a rare lupus manifestation in active pediatric patients. The interesting overlap between chronic arthritis and lupus, called rhupus suggests a new entity with a different clinical profile and a poor response to treatment with NSAIDs alone.

40|$|SUMMARY Pain can be {{measured}} using a visual analogue scale in children with juvenile <b>chronic</b> <b>polyarthritis.</b> In a study of 100 children failures were uncommon {{after the age of}} 5. Pain severity was strikingly lower than in a group of adults with rheumatoid arthritis and correlated poorly with other measures of disease severity and activity. Because of the low scores, measurement of pain is likely to be less useful in children for assessing the effects of treatment than it is in adults. Measurement of pain has proved to be particularly useful in assessing the effects of treatment in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Visual analogue scales {{have been shown to be}} a satisfactory method of measurement with the advantage ofgreater sensitivity than the more conventional simple descriptive scale (Huskisson, 1974 a; Scott and Huskisson, 1976). In this study the method has been applied to children with arthritis. Methods Pain severity was measured in 100 children with juvenile <b>chronic</b> <b>polyarthritis,</b> either inpatients or outpatients attending the Canadian Red Cross Memorial Hospital. Juvenile <b>chronic</b> <b>polyarthritis</b> was defined as polyarthritis beginning before the 16 th birthday, and any patient over the age of 17 at the time of the study was excluded. A visual analogue scale without definitions or divisions was used at the same time as a 4 -point simple descriptive scale; these scales were used as described by Huskisson (1974 a). At the same time an independent assessment was made of the activity of the disease, based on swelling of joints and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and severity of the disease, based on the number and severity of joints involved and functional status. Both were graded on a 4 -point scale. Results The age distribution of the children is shown in Fig. 1, divided according to whether or not they were able to complete a visual analogue pain scale. 11 % faile...|$|E

Suppression of the acute immune complex-induced vasculitis was demonstrated using 15 -methyl-PGE, administered orally 12 hours prior to antigen-antibody challenge.
