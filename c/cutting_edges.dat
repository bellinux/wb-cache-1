5|$|Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) {{state that}} {{presence}} of a horny sheath in Hesperosaurus is a strong indication that the plates had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate {{as a whole and}} provided it with sharp <b>cutting</b> <b>edges.</b> Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the sheath would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly colored. Thermoregulation, on the other hand would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the keratin covering. A 2015 study of the shapes and sizes of Hespersaurus plates suggested that they were sexually dimorphic, with wide plates belonging to males and taller plates belonging to females.|$|E
5|$|The tooth is {{recurved}} with {{a backward}} bend, and is oval in cross-section. Its {{front and back}} <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> are finely serrated, extending two-thirds down each edge. There are six denticles per millimeter (0.04in), and each denticle is square and chiseled. The overall form of the tooth, its width and shape in cross-section and its curvature resemble those in the maxilla (upper jawbone) and mandible of the species Dromaeosaurus albertensis from North America. Blood grooves are indistinct or absent, also similar to Dromaeosaurus, and differing {{from members of the}} Velociraptorinae subfamily. Dromaeosauroides differs from Dromaeosaurus in that the cutting edge at the front side is further {{from the middle of the}} tooth. Although the tooth is larger and the denticles similar, each denticle was smaller than those of Dromaeosaurus, which had only 13–20 denticles per , instead of Dromaeosauroides 30. The second known tooth is smaller——with the same features as the holotype.|$|E
40|$|The helical drill with curved <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> are {{characterized}} {{by the fact that}} the energetically load for a unity length of <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> is not directly proportional with the point distance along the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge.</b> So, the wear intensity of these tools is reduced regarding the wear for the straight lined <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> drill. In this paper, is proposed a model for unitary energetically load value determination for the tool’s <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> starting from an experimentally known value of the force which appear at the unity length of the tool’s <b>cutting</b> <b>edge.</b> Two curved <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> forms are analyzed, regarding a straight lined <b>cutting</b> <b>edge.</b> Conclusions regarding the optimum form of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> for this kind of tools are elaborated...|$|R

For the tool performance the microscopic <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> shape is very important. By preparing the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> the tool performance can be improved due to the reduction of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> chipping {{and the creation of a}} defined stable edge rounding.

5|$|The {{skull of}} Megalosaurus is poorly known. The {{discovered}} skull elements are generally rather large {{in relation to}} the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that Megalosaurus had an uncommonly large head. The praemaxilla is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the maxilla was short. In the depression around the antorbital fenestra to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the fenestra maxillaris. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> bear eighteen to twenty denticula per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13–14/13–14. The jugal bone is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an air sac in the nasal bone. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate autapomorphy.|$|E

This pattern of bit was developed by Russell Jennings in the mid-19th century.|$|E
40|$|AbstractEvaluation of {{the cutting}} tool is an {{important}} aspect when a machining process is monitored. At this time, microgeometry of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> is very frequently used term. It has a great influence on the cutting process and {{it is necessary to}} know how correctly to measure parameters of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> to ensure reliability and repeatability. Nowadays, many devices exist on the market which can be used for measuring the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge.</b> They are based on tactile or optical principles. Parameters of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> have a great influence on tool life and therefore it is important to measure them correctly. Primarily the radius of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> and the K factor is usually monitored. This paper deals with measuring parameters on the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> such as radius of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> K factor and roughness of the surface, chipping, and their evaluation when machining special alloy Inconel 718 which is used mainly in the aerospace industry.

25|$|A Forstner bit could {{bore the}} {{mounting}} hole for the hinge, but particle board and MDF are very abrasive materials, and steel <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> soon wear. A tungsten carbide cutter is needed, but the complex {{shape of a}} forstner bit is difficult to manufacture in carbide, so this special drill bit with a simpler shape is commonly used. It has <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> of tungsten carbide brazed to a steel body; a center spur keeps the bit from wandering.|$|E

40|$|The fatigue {{strength}} of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> affects dominantly the tool life, especially in the interrupted material removal processes. The <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> fatigue of uncoated and coated tools can be effectively assessed by the repetitive impact test. Cemented carbide inserts of various grain size, surface roughness, coating and heat treatment were investigated by applying repetitive impacts close to the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> for detecting its {{fatigue strength}}. Complementary FEM simulations of the impact test, at various distances from the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> provided insights on the developed stress fields. The impact distance from the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> was corroborated to have a dominant effect on the tool life, while a reduction of the roughness {{and the application of}} finer substrate grains led to an increase of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> fatigue strength.

25|$|Sawtooth bits {{are also}} available, which include many more <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> to the cylinder. These cut faster, but produce a more ragged hole. They have {{advantages}} over Forstner bits when boring into end grain.|$|E
25|$|The bit {{includes}} a center point which guides {{it throughout the}} cut (and incidentally spoils the otherwise flat bottom of the hole). The cylindrical cutter around the perimeter shears the wood fibers {{at the edge of}} the bore, and also helps guide the bit into the material more precisely. The tool in the image has a total of two <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> in this cylinder. Forstner bits have radial <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> to plane off the material at the bottom of the hole. The bit in the image has two radial edges. Other designs may have more. Forstner bits have no mechanism to clear chips from the hole, and therefore must be pulled out periodically.|$|E
25|$|Metals are {{typically}} isotropic, and an ordinary twist drill bit shears {{the edges of}} the hole cleanly. Wood drilled across the grain has long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend {{to pull out of the}} wood hole, rather than being cleanly cut at the hole edge. The lip and spur drill bit has the outside corner of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of the <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> plane off the base of the hole. By cutting the periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having them pull messily out of the timber.|$|E

On {{the basis}} of {{analyzing}} the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> structure and <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> radius measurement of high-speed insert, thermal- mechanical coupling finite element method (FEM) is used in this paper, to obtain the effect law of different <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> radius on the mechanical-thermal distribution of high-speed cutting TiAl 6 V 4.
