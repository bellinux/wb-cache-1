25|$|Stirling engines {{have a high}} {{efficiency}} compared to steam engines, being able to reach 50% efficiency. They are also capable of quiet operation and can use almost any heat source. The heat energy source is generated external to the Stirling engine rather than by internal combustion as with the Otto cycle or Diesel cycle engines. Because the Stirling engine is compatible with alternative and renewable energy sources it could become increasingly significant {{as the price of}} conventional fuels rises, and also in light of concerns such as depletion of oil supplies and climate change. This type of engine is currently generating interest as the core component of micro combined heat and power (<b>CHP)</b> <b>units,</b> in which it is more efficient and safer than a comparable steam engine. However, it has a low power-to-weight ratio, rendering it more suitable for use in static installations where space and weight are not at a premium.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} in support {{of its ability to}} improve the overall {{economic}} cost-effectiveness and flexibility of the Danish energy system, the financially feasible integration of large-scale heat pumps (HP) with existing combined heat and power (CHP) plants, is critically sensitive to the operational mode of the HP vis-à-vis the operational coefficient of performance, mainly given by the temperature level of the heat source. When using ground source for low-temperature heat source, heat production costs increases by about 10 %, while partial use of condensed flue gasses for low-temperature heat source results in an 8 % cost reduction. Furthermore, the analysis shows that when a large-scale HP is integrated with an existing CHP plant, the projected spot market situation in The Nordic Power Exchange (Nord Pool) towards 2025, which reflects a growing share of wind power and heat-supply constrained power generation electricity, further reduces the operational hours of the <b>CHP</b> <b>unit</b> over time, while increasing the operational hours of the HP unit. In result, an HP unit at half the heat production capacity as the <b>CHP</b> <b>unit</b> in combination with a heat-only boiler represents as a possibly financially feasible alternative to CHP operation, rather than a supplement to <b>CHP</b> <b>unit</b> operation. While such revised operational strategy would have impacts on policies to promote co-generation, these results indicate that the integration of large-scale HP may jeopardize efforts to promote co-generation. Policy instruments should be designed to promote the integration of HP with lower than half of the heating capacity of the <b>CHP</b> <b>unit.</b> Also it is found, that CHP-HP plant designs should allow for the utilization of heat recovered from the <b>CHP</b> <b>unit’s</b> flue gasses for both concurrent (<b>CHP</b> <b>unit</b> and HP unit) and independent operation (HP unit only). For independent operation, the recovered heat is required to be stored. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of {{thermal energy storage}} (TES) is an effective way of improving the power load regulation capability of {{combined heat and power}} (<b>CHP)</b> generating <b>units.</b> In this paper, a theoretical investigation on the thermal energy storage system of a <b>CHP</b> <b>unit</b> that employs the microencapsulated phase change material slurry (MPCMS) as the working fluid is carried out. The results indicate that the microcapsule particle internal melting rate is progressively small; 90 % latent heat can be absorbed in 63 % total melting time. The melting time of particles in micron is very short, and the diameter is an important factor for microcapsule melting. For the MPCMS flow in a circular tube, the temperature distribution between laminar flows and turbulent flows is different. In a turbulent flow, there is an approximate isothermal section along the tube, which cannot be found in a laminar flow. Additionally, a thermal storage system with MPCMS as heat transfer fluid for a <b>CHP</b> <b>unit</b> is proposed. A case study for a 300 MW <b>CHP</b> <b>unit</b> found that the use of an MPSMS thermal energy storage system increases the power peak shaving capacity by 81. 4 %.

Within the project, data from pervasive sensing was used to calibrate a simulation model of an office building and impose occupant-related inputs at the time step level as a means to reduce modelling uncertainty. The MIMO input parameters considered include space temperatures, heat store temperatures, electricity demand and electricity tariff, while the output parameters include space heat supply, heat stored, electricity utilised locally or exported, and <b>CHP</b> <b>unit</b> fuel use. The simulation model was used to compare performance when the <b>CHP</b> <b>unit</b> is subjected to conventional and MIMO control.
