5|$|The {{government}} <b>coastguard</b> {{used some}} of the fortifications as bases to combat smuggling. Calshot was a good location for interception vessels to lie in wait and, {{by the middle of}} the century, two officers and forty-two men were stationed there; Sandown Castle in Kent was also used by the <b>coastguard</b> for anti-smuggling operations. In the coming decades some forts were declared obsolete and put to new uses; Portland was disarmed after the war and converted into a private house. Gravesend was superseded by the New Tavern Fort and demolished in 1844. Meanwhile, the ruins of Netley Castle were transformed into a Gothic-styled house from 1826 onwards.|$|E
5|$|After {{rounding}} Widmouth Head, {{the path}} passes 'The <b>Coastguard</b> Cottages' in Hele Bay {{and enters the}} seaside resort of Ilfracombe, with its small harbour, surrounded by cliffs. A seasonal foot passenger ferry service runs from the harbour to Lundy Island, and the Balmoral, the Waverley and pleasure boats ply to Porthcawl near Swansea. From Ilfracombe to Bideford the Tarka Trail coincides with the South West Coast Path.|$|E
5|$|Aurora went {{straight}} into reserve at Devonport after completion, but was commissioned for service with the Channel Squadron in 1890–92. She {{was transferred to}} Bantry, Ireland, in 1893 {{to serve as the}} local <b>coastguard</b> ship until 1895. That year the ship was reassigned to the Devonport Reserve and remained there until 1899. Aurora participated in Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Fleet review on 26 June 1897 at Spithead.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coastguards</b> Beach and Wonwell Beach {{are open}} every day. <b>Coastguards</b> Beach {{also has a}} pillbox {{although}} it is now almost covered by undergrowth, {{and the remains of}} yet another lie a little south of <b>Coastguards</b> beach, but this has been damaged by the sea.|$|R

50|$|The {{station is}} officially {{part of the}} Dorset Search and Rescue, also working with HM <b>Coastguards,</b> the Search and Rescue Helicopter, the RNLI, UK Border Agencies, Immigration, Drug Alliance, Dorset Police, and the Marine Police. Additionally the station gives regular weather reports to HM <b>Coastguards</b> at Weymouth.|$|R
5|$|Emergency {{services}} {{are provided by}} the States of Jersey Police {{with the support of}} the Honorary Police as necessary, States of Jersey Ambulance Service, Jersey Fire and Rescue Service and the Jersey <b>Coastguard.</b> The Jersey Fire and Rescue Service and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate an inshore rescue and lifeboat service; Channel Islands Air Search provides rapid response airborne search of the surrounding waters.|$|E
5|$|Hampshire County Council leased {{the site}} from the Crown Estates in 1964; the castle itself {{passed into the}} {{guardianship}} of the state, and the hangars were used as an activity centre. A Royal National Lifeboat Institution station opened in 1971 alongside the castle, with a -tall replacement <b>coastguard</b> tower constructed two years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s a {{research}} project sponsored by BP into a prototype safety boat for Barra Head also assisted the RNLI in developing the Atlantic 21 class lifeboat. The boat used was a Halmatic Atlantic 21 MKIII modified for long-range operations and with full offshore capability. The project involved multi-organisation co-operation and included Halmatic themselves, HM <b>Coastguard</b> and the Royal Marines Amphibious Trials and Testing Unit.|$|E

5000|$|After {{a three-week}} delay he set sail into high winds and what <b>Coastguards</b> {{described}} as [...] "the worst weather forecast possible" [...] and progressed less than 3 miles in three days. He {{got as far}} as Sheringham before a Lifeboat and helicopter went to his aid. Hill refused their assistance and stated he wished to carry on with his journey. <b>Coastguards</b> received numerous calls from concerned members of the public [...] "who thought he was about to go down." [...] but he [...] "insisted on carrying on against the advice of <b>coastguards</b> and rescuers." ...|$|R

5|$|The armed forces' third arm, the Liberian National Coast Guard, was {{established}} in 1959. Throughout the Tubman period the <b>coastguard</b> {{was little more than}} a few sometimes unserviceable patrol craft manned by ill-trained personnel, though its training improved in the 1980s to the point where it was considered the best trained of the armed services.|$|E
5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the <b>Coastguard</b> to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the <b>Coastguard</b> but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Great Britain and Ireland, {{ships in}} distress, {{or the public}} {{reporting}} an accident, contact the emergency services by telephone or radio. Calls are redirected to HM <b>Coastguard</b> or the Irish Coast Guard as appropriate, who will coordinate air-sea rescue operations and may call on the RNLI (or independent lifeboats), their own land-based rescue personnel and rescue helicopters to help.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Calshot {{returned}} to duty {{as an active}} air base, housing two squadrons of Sunderland flying boats which {{took part in the}} Berlin airlift of 1948, before being passed across to Maintenance Command in 1953. The Southampton Harbour Board built a <b>coastguard</b> lookout tower at the castle in 1952, and the following year they began to construct a signal station tower on top of the keep, complete with radar and radio facilities, which opened in 1958. By then, military seaplanes had become obsolete, and the RAF station was finally closed in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Some {{other sites}} {{were no longer}} {{considered}} viable at all. West Cowes was decommissioned in 1854 and became the club house of the Royal Yacht Squadron. Sandown Castle in Kent, suffering badly from coastal erosion, began to be demolished from 1863 onwards; Hull Citadel and its 16th-century fortifications were demolished in 1864 {{to make way for}} docks; Yarmouth was decommissioned in 1885, becoming a <b>coastguard</b> signalling station; and Sandgate, also suffering from coastal erosion, was sold off to the South Eastern Railway company in 1888.|$|E
5|$|With its {{powerful}} swells, Thurso is a notable location for surfing and kayaking, with international surfing championship events having regularly {{been held in}} the area. It attracts surfers {{from all over the}} world, and both the European Surfing Championships and Scottish Surf Kayaking Championships have been held in Caithness, with Thurso East being the main focus of activity. An annual raft race is organised by the North Coast Branch of <b>Coastguard</b> Association.|$|E
50|$|Joing the <b>Coastguards</b> (Henry Spenner, Laurie Earle and Horse) are Romeo Stodart of The Magic Numbers and Johnny Flynn.|$|R
50|$|After his return, Keohane {{joined the}} Coast Guard service. He {{served as the}} {{district}} officer of <b>coastguards</b> for the Isle of Man.|$|R
50|$|Immediately to {{the south}} of the station is the low Colonnade Viaduct, which carries the railway above the small river that runs through the gardens and the main {{footpath}} from the town to the beach and the South West Coast Path. To the north of the station is <b>Coastguards</b> Footbridge, with <b>Coastguards</b> Cottage, now a café, on the hill above the line to the west, and Brunel's Boat House between the line and the beach to the east.|$|R
5|$|A {{hurricane}} warning was issued for the coastal locations north of Belize City with the forecast of 150mph (240km/h) winds. The government instituted a dusk-to-dawn curfew from Belize City to the Mexican border. On August 16and17, Prime Minister Said Musa chaired two meetings of Belize's National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO). He instructed {{the newly created}} <b>Coastguard</b> to evacuate popular tourist sites Caye Caulker and Ambergris Caye by boat and plane. Authorities also evacuated Belize City's three hospitals, moving high-risk patients inland to the capital Belmopan. The mayor urged residents to leave Belize City and {{to make use of}} shelters in the capital.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1760s, Westgate {{consisted}} {{of only a}} farm, a <b>coastguard</b> station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited {{its name from the}} Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1880s, their engines were {{becoming}} worn out {{and most of}} the ships were placed into reserve for a few years before being sold for breaking up. The machinery of Avon, Dwarf and Elk was in good enough shape that they were assigned as tenders to the <b>coastguard</b> district ships at Hull, Southampton, and Liverpool for a number of years. Midge was also an exception and was retained in Chinese waters until 1907 when she was sold at Hong Kong. Elk lasted nearly as long in harbour service as she was reclassified as a tugboat in 1890 and was then sold as a dredger in 1905.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, Albright and Wilson built a {{chemical}} {{works on the}} opposite side of the dock from the power stations. The chemical works produced white phosphorus from phosphate rock imported, through the docks, into the UK. Phosphate rock was stored in concrete silos on the dockside until it was required. Electricity provided by the local power stations was used to run six 7.5megawatt electric arc furnaces (45MW total) that reduced the phosphate rock. The phosphorus was then moved in sealed railway tanks to Oldbury and to Kirkby. After the closure of the factory the decontamination included the removal of yellow (spontaneously combustible) and red allotropes of phosphorus. The site is now home to Portishead volunteer <b>coastguard.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of the 23 August an Fw 190 was claimed off Dunkirk and on 8/9 September 1943, an Fw 190A-5 off Aldborough proved his 19th victory and last claim of Cunningham for the year. The Fw 190 was seen to crash into the sea by the <b>Coastguard.</b> Cunningham {{achieved}} his 20th and final air victory on {{the night of}} the 2/3 January 1944. He chased a Messerschmitt Me 410 to France, near Boulogne before shooting it down. The machine, Werknummer 017, Code U5+FE, belonging to 14./Kampfgeschwader 2 (KG 2), crashed at Marquise. Oberleutnant Helmut Schülze and Heinz Beger were killed.|$|E
5|$|The London Fire Brigade is the {{statutory}} fire and rescue service for Greater London. It {{is run by}} the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and is the third largest fire service in the world. National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the London Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the largest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world. The London Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required.
