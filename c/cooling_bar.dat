40|$|INTRODUCTION The HER {{circumference}} is 2200 m and {{consists of}} six straight sections 120 m in length and six arc sections 240 m in length. Each arc contains 33 quadrupole magnets and 32 dipole magnets to form 16 cells per arc. The HER vacuum system design[1] consists of 32 dipole vacuum chambers positioned in the magnet gaps for each arc totaling 192 dipole chambers. The dipole chamber extrusion is about 189 mm x 60 mm x 5 mm thick with a cross-sectional area of 22. 6 cm 2 (3. 5 in 2). The <b>cooling</b> <b>bar</b> extrusion has a cross-sectional area of 3. 7 cm 2 (0. 57 in 2). The beam orbit through the dipole magnet is curved. In order to minimize beam impedance losses, the dipole chamber is formed to this beam orbit and corresponding dipole magnet bend radius of 165 m. To accomplish this, the chambers are stretchformed to a radius of 165 m within a tolerance band of 2 mm. This tolerance is based on con...|$|E

40|$|The inspiral and {{merger of}} a binary neutron star (NSNS) {{can lead to}} the {{formation}} of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). As the HMNS loses thermal pressure due to neutrino cooling and/or centrifugal support due to gravitational wave (GW) emission, and/or magnetic breaking of differential rotation it will collapse to a black hole. To assess the importance of shock-induced thermal pressure and cooling, we adopt an idealized equation of state and perform NSNS simulations in full GR through late inspiral, merger, and HMNS formation, accounting for cooling. We show that thermal pressure contributes significantly to the support of the HMNS against collapse and that thermal cooling accelerates its "delayed" collapse. Our simulations demonstrate explicitly that cooling can induce the catastrophic collapse of a hot hypermassive neutron star formed following the merger of binary neutron stars. Thus, cooling physics is important to include in NSNS merger calculations to accurately determine the lifetime of the HMNS remnant and to extract information about the NS equation of state, <b>cooling</b> mechanisms, <b>bar</b> instabilities and B-fields from the GWs emitted during the transient phase prior to BH formation.

In addition, because the metallic impurities and expansion of volume during solidification are preferably moved to a liquid phase, a high-quality silicon substrate, without defects such as cracks and impurities in the substrate, could be manufactured in the interface structure.

This search has been carried out using data from two 2350 Kg, 2 K <b>cooled,</b> aluminum <b>bar</b> detectors: NAUTILUS, located in Frascati (Italy), and EXPLORER, that was located in CERN Geneva (CH). Both antennas are equipped with cosmic ray shower detectors: signals in the bar due to showers are continuously detected and used to characterize the antenna performances. The bar excitation mechanism is based on the so called thermo-acoustic effect, studied on dedicated experiments that use particle beams. This mechanism predicts that vibrations of bars are induced by the heat deposited in the bar from the particle. The geometrical acceptance of the bar detectors is 19. 5 m 2 sr, that is smaller than that of other detectors used for similar searches. However, the detection mechanism is completely different and is more straightforward than in other detectors. We will show the results of ten years of data from NAUTILUS (2003 - 2012) and 7 years from EXPLORER (2003 - 2009).

The thermal grill illusion is such a pain illusion, where interlaced warm and <b>cool</b> temperature <b>bars</b> (thermal grill) produce a paradoxical burning sensation. Previous studies have only systematically investigated the thermal grill illusion in pain-free volunteers. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate whether the response to the thermal grill illusion was tolerable in patients with chronic pain and whether the response differed between patients with chronic pain and pain-free volunteers. SUBJECTS Sixteen pain-free participants and 18 chronic pain patients (seven not receiving opioids and 11 receiving opioids). METHODS The thermal grill response was investigated using a custom-built thermal grill. Heat and cold pain thresholds were also determined. RESULTS Chronic pain patients reported less intense pain, heat, and unpleasantness to the thermal grill compared with pain-free participants; in particular, there was an overall main effect for significantly less heat from the thermal grill compared with pain-free participants (P[*]=[*] 0. 016). At the 22 / 38 °C combination, although the majority of pain-free participants experienced the illusion to some degree, the majority of pain patients in both groups did not (median pain score 0). Although perceived heat from the thermal grill was significantly lower in chronic pain patients, both heat and cold pain thresholds did not differ among the three populations. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary data suggest that the thermal grill response may provide insights into pain sensitivity that are not detected by conventional thermal quantitative sensory testing.

40|$|During {{the last}} few years high power diode laser arrays have become well {{established}} for direct material processing due to their high efficiency of more than 50 %. But standard broad-area waveguide designs are susceptible to modal instabilities and filamentations resulting in low beam qualities. The beam quality increases by more than a factor of four by using tapered laser arrays, but so far they suffer from lower efficiencies. Therefore tapered lasers are mainly used today as single emitters in external resonator configurations. With increased output power and lifetime, they will be much more attractive for material processing and for pumping of fiber amplifiers. High efficiency tapered mini bars emitting at a wavelength of 980 nm are developed, and in order to qualify the bars, the characteristics of single emitters and mini bars from the same wafer have been compared. The mini bars have a width of 6 mm with 12 emitters. The ridge waveguide tapered lasers consist of a 500 µm long ridge and a 2000 µm long tapered section. The results show very similar behavior of the electro-optical characteristics and the beam quality for single emitters and bars. Due to different junction temperatures, different slope efficiencies were measured: 0. 8 W/A for passively <b>cooled</b> mini <b>bars</b> and 1. 0 W/A for actively cooled mini-bars and single emitters. The threshold current of 0. 7 A per emitter is the same for single emitters and emitter arrays.
