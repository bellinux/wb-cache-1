5|$|Andersen {{was accused}} of crimes on several {{occasions}} in the post-war years, but was most often acquitted in court. Amongst the <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> which he was charged but acquitted in court was the theft of building materials in 1954. Another time he was tricked into lending his car to two people who broke into a goldsmith's shop in Tønsberg. Strongly intoxicated {{at the time of}} the crime, he was charged but fully acquitted. In 1955 he was, however, convicted and sentenced to 36days in prison for selling 30bottles of denatured alcohol, alcohol that was supposed to have been used at his factory.|$|E
5|$|As {{an escaped}} POW, Pechersky was conscripted into a special penal battalions, {{conforming}} to Stalin's Order No. 270 {{and was sent}} to the front to fight German forces in some of the toughest engagements of the war. Pechersky's battalion commander, Major Andreev, was so shocked by his description of Sobibor that he permitted Pechersky to go to Moscow and speak to the Commission of Inquiry of the <b>Crimes</b> <b>of</b> Fascist-German Aggressors and their Accomplices. The Commission listened to Pechersky and published the report Uprising in Sobibor based on his testimony. This report was included in the Black Book, one of the first comprehensive compilations about the Holocaust, written by Vasily Grossman and Ilya Ehrenburg.|$|E
5|$|Both {{civilian}} and military authorities considered the Wehrmachtbericht to be a vital instrument of German home-front mobilisation, the civilian contribution to the German war effort, especially after the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad. According to historians Wolfram Wette and Daniel Uziel, the final 9 May 1945 communiqué {{laid the foundation for}} the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, the notion that the Wehrmacht had fought honourably and was not implicated in the <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> the Nazi regime, for which (according to the myth) only the SS bore responsibility.|$|E

5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E

Initially scheduled to enter into force in April 2010, this was changed to 1 July 2011. The Act repeals all previous statutory and common law provisions in relation to bribery, instead replacing them with the <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> bribery, being bribed, the bribery of foreign public officials, {{and the failure of}} a commercial organisation to prevent bribery on its behalf.|$|E

40|$|RESUMÉ The {{theme of}} this thesis is {{comparison}} of the particularly serious <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> murder in the Czech and Slovak criminal law. The aim of this thesis is to compare the legislation {{with regard to the}} particularly serious <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> murder in the Czech and Slovak law, to find its identical, similar or different characteristics and to point them out. The thesis first focuses on the historical development of the legislation with regard to prosecuting the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> murder, {{as well as to the}} constitutional protection of human life in both countries, which are being compared, i. e. the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. Furthermore, the thesis focuses on the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> against life in general. The key chapter of the work deals with legislation regarding the particularly serious <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> murder and its qualified and privileged facts in the contemporary Czech law. This is followed by a chapter, which presents the current legislation with regard to facts <b>of</b> the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> murder and related facts <b>of</b> the same <b>crime</b> in the Slovak Republic. The subsequent chapter includes a comparison of the legislation regarding the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> murder in both countries. Based on the comparison of the legislation related to facts <b>of</b> the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> murder in the Slovak and Czech law, it is possible to come to the conclusion [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The ICTY also indicted Goran Hadžić, the Croatian Serb {{political}} {{leader in the}} eastern Slavonia region {{and head of the}} SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia government declared by the Croatian Serbs in the region at the time before it merged into the Republic of Serbian Krajina. The charges include war <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> persecutions, extermination, murder, imprisonment, torture, inhumane acts and cruel treatment, deportation, forcible transfer of population, wanton destruction and plunder of property. Hadžić died in July 2016, before his trial could be completed.|$|E
5|$|The libel trial {{became a}} cause célèbre as salacious details of Wilde's private life with Taylor and Douglas {{began to appear}} in the press. A team of private detectives had {{directed}} Queensberry's lawyers, led by Edward Carson QC, {{to the world of the}} Victorian underground. Wilde's association with blackmailers and male prostitutes, cross-dressers and homosexual brothels was recorded, and various persons involved were interviewed, some being coerced to appear as witnesses since they too were accomplices to the <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> which Wilde was accused.|$|E
5|$|According to the 1993 book by Russian {{psychiatrist}} Mikhail Buyanov, {{the harm}} inflicted by Soviet punitive psychiatry {{on the image}} of domestic medicine is, of course, great, but bears no comparison to the <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> the Nazi doctors. Now, when all the passions have cooled, one {{can say that the}} zeal of Soviet psychiatrists inflicted suffering on up to 100 or 120 people of all 280 million citizens of the former Soviet Union, Buyanov writes. He adds that among the persons were many fanatical nationalists, religious sectarians, and political paranoiacs who after escaping to freedom corrupted the masses, сrammed their heads with nonsense, carried away immature people with their ideas through the connivance of the so-called progressive intelligentsia, and a result of it is wars, blood, and reciprocal hatred.|$|E
40|$|Food {{safety is}} one of the basic {{requirements}} of livelihood, however, with the development of the socialist market economy, many problems exist in the food safety field. Therefore the governments have enacted a series of policies and regulations to supervise food safety, one of which is the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> dereliction of duty of food safety, which is put forward to improve and perfect the food safety supervision and management and food security. This paper aims to study the necessity <b>of</b> the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> dereliction of duty in food safety and current situation <b>of</b> the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> dereliction of duty to provide some feasible ideas of improving the food safety...|$|R

5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told {{he was free to}} leave, and Alvarado's parents were not allowed to be present during the interview. Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E
5|$|In December 1970 Gomułka {{scored a}} major {{political}} victory when Poland obtained a West German recognition of the post-World War II borders. The German side secured the right to emigrate to West Germany for the residents of Poland of German identity and to help financially those who stayed by granting pensions: hundreds of thousands eventually became affected. German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who signed the agreement, also asked on his knees for forgiveness for the <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> the Nazis (Warschauer Kniefall). His gesture was understood in Poland as being addressed to all Poles, although it was actually made {{at the site of}} the Warsaw Ghetto and was thus directed primarily toward the Jews. The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years earlier, when the Polish Church issued its famous Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops, criticized then by the Polish government.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the cast changes, the tone and pacing of the films was also matured and altered for comic effect. The films changed the petty <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> the books into gruesome murders, that are often spearheaded by dangerous criminals. At {{the time of the}} films, Nancy and Ned/Ted's romance in the books was set aside for the main mystery; on the other hand, romance was a prominent theme of the films, with Nancy being portrayed as the domineering girlfriend, and Ted as the repressive boyfriend usually duped into another scheme. While book Nancy was usually treated with authority and equal respect to other adults, Nancy in the films was often chastised by adults for her habit to go into mysteries, and she often found herself at odds with her father and the police.|$|E
50|$|The similar <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> {{fraud is}} the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> deceiving another, {{including}} {{through the use}} of objects obtained through forgery.

40|$|There is a {{problematic}} overlap between bona fide humanitarian intervention and the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> aggression. Under international law, the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> aggression is defined so vaguely that it potentially {{could be applied}} to try leaders who seek to stop documented mass atrocities with armed force. This Note seeks a resolution to that overlap: a path that would allow those who would plan and engage in bona fide humanitarian intervention to be exempt from prosecution for aggression. The Note first examines the genealogy <b>of</b> the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> aggression. It then analyzes several possible solutions to policing aggression without unduly deterring humanitarian intervention. Finally, this Note concludes that the existing imbalance can be corrected by: (1) granting the International Criminal Court exclusive jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> aggression, (2) modifying the current regulations to bar the U. N. Security Council in prosecuting the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> aggression, and (3) developing an affirmative defense to the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> aggression that would allow indicted leaders to use either a high or low evidentiary standard depending on whether their state acted alone or through a multilateral organization...|$|R

Criminal liability of legal entities {{has not been a}} subject of such extensive research as criminal liability of natural persons, let alone criminology <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> legal entities - the origins of this field first appeared {{in the first half of}} 20 th century, when the criminologist E.
