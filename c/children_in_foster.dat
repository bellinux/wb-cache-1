500|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of ICWA in 1978, Indian children were often forcibly removed from their homes and placed in either Native American boarding schools or in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes. [...] Studies conducted in 1969 and in 1974 indicated that as many as 25 to 35 percent of tribal children were being removed from their homes, and consequently from tribal culture. [...] Testimony in the House Committee for Interior and Insular Affairs showed that in some states, the per capita rate of Indian <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> care was nearly 16 times higher than the rate for non-Indians. [...] In some cases, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) paid the states to remove tribal children and to place them with non-Indian families and religious groups. Congress determined that if Indian children continued to be removed from Indian homes at this rate, tribal survival would be threatened and stated that tribal stability was as important as {{the best interests of the}} child. One of the factors in this judgment was that, because of the differences in culture, what was in the best interest of a non-Indian child was not necessarily what was in the best interest of an Indian child, especially due to the influence of extended families and tribal relationships.|$|E

Twenty-eight of California's rural hospitals and 20 of its critical-access hospitals are district hospitals. They are formed by local municipalities, have boards that are individually elected by their local communities, and exist to serve local needs. They are a particularly important provider of healthcare to uninsured patients and patients with Medi-Cal (which is California's Medicaid program, serving low-income persons, some senior citizens, persons with disabilities, <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> care, and pregnant women).

In 1863 the Territory came under the control of South Australia which in 1910 passed the Northern Territory Aboriginals Act 1910. The Act claimed to be for the [...] "Protection and Control" [...] of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of the Territory. Under the Act, the [...] "Chief Protector of Aboriginals" [...] was appointed as the legal guardian of every child whose mother was Aboriginal, and had the power to confine such children to a reserve or Aboriginal institution. That is, indigenous children could be removed by Administrative order, whereas non-Indigenous children at the time could only be removed by order of a Court. This policy of removing indigenous children from their family continued when control of the Northern Territory was transferred from South Australia to the federal government. The Aboriginals Ordinance 1918 extended these powers, putting Aboriginal females under the total control of the Chief Protector. [...] Most of the Aboriginal institutions were operated by operated by churches. From 1964 indigenous children could only be removed under the same circumstances as non-Indigenous children, however, the conditions of life for Indigenous people put them at greater risk of having their children removed on the ground of neglect or destitution.

2500|$|California has {{the largest}} {{population}} of foster care youth in the nation, with 55,218 children in the system as of 2012. This is over {{twice as many as}} the 20,529 foster children in New York, the state with the second largest population of foster youth, had by the end of 2012. Over 30 percent of California foster youth reside in Los Angeles County, amounting to 18,523 children. Children can be removed from their homes and placed into the foster care system for a variety of reasons, but, in California, 81.2 percent of children were removed because of neglect. Even after being placed in the foster care system, however, these children might not find the kind of care or stability they need. Girls in foster care have been shown to have marginally higher rates of teenage pregnancy than the general population of California. <b>Children</b> <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> care also have to face disproportionately high rates of mental illnesses as some studies have shown that as much as 47.9 percent of foster care youth showed signs of serious emotional or behavioral issues. After [...] "aging out" [...] of the system at age 18, research has shown that previous foster youth still face difficult instability in their lives. As much as 30 percent of previous foster children are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Only about 50 percent graduate from high school and less than 10 percent graduate from college. A study focused on foster care alumni in Los Angeles County showed that about 65 percent leave foster care without a place to live and 25 percent are incarcerated by age 20. Despite these difficulties, California is working toward easing the transition for foster youth through programs and legislation like the California Fostering Connections to Success Act of 2010, which expanded upon similar federal legislation and increased the age limit for receiving foster care benefits.|$|E
