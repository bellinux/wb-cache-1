But occasionally a <b>complete</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>plant</b> is purchased, dismantled and reassembled somewhere else. Because GFCF conceptually includes many transactions in used fixed assets by resident firms, which are valued lower than new assets, this creates problems for the estimation and valuation of the gross capital stock.|$|E
40|$|The present-day {{situation}} on the Jordan market indicates an occasion for Czech production factories to merge their own market, a partnership with local partners and to cooperate at fitting-shop construction of Czech companies in Jordan. The Czech Republic and Jordan have agreements about cooperation in business, culture, health insurance, medical philosophy and about investment supporting. These were concluded in 1978 - 1998. The balance of the barter between the Czech Republic and Jordan has been active on the behoof of the Czech Republic; the main items of the Czech export into Jordan are motor-cars, textile products, rolled material, petrochemical and consumer products; from Jordan mainly phosphates are imported. The barter between the Czech Republic and Jordan mismatch the both countries needs. The mutual year barter has been moving between 8 - 13 mil. USD last years, whereas the Czech export into Jordan creates 85 % from this amount. There {{has not been realized}} not a single Czech <b>complete</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>plant</b> in Jordan market up to this day. The present-day economic situation in Jordan is liberal towards the whole world however it is influenced by the political situation in Palestine and Iraq which holds under the fast growth of import and investments. Investment orders are announced with large requirements on their financing, so it is not possible for Czech clients to realize them. On the other hand it is necessary to say that many Jordanian mediators collect offers from Czech suppliers only for comparison and evaluation of competitions and tenders, which is a loss for Czech companies and it discourages them from further activities in business cooperation with Jordan.

40|$|Introduction The {{development}} of special, active physical sensor {{systems for the}} direct 3 D measurement of environment geometry is gaining more and more importance, {{as it is the}} basis for realising many applications in the area of automation technology. This is especially true for applications that require an on-line acquisition of geometric environment information, such as the guidance of autonomous robot vehicles, service robots or other assistance systems. In addition to these applications, the capture of the "As-Is" state of certain objects or complete environments ("Digital Factory") is becoming more important in order to obtain further results for the realisation, planning or simulation of certain operations, based on the actual state of the environment. Examples are the inspection and modelling of environmental objects, such as tunnel tubes, buildings or facades or <b>complete</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>plants,</b> such as chemical processing plants, nuclear power stations or single work cells in the...|$|R
40|$|Ontario is the {{industrial}} heartland of Canada {{and more than}} 80 % of its energy comes from Canadian sources with the remainder from the neighbouring U. S. states. Because of the ever increasing demand for energy relating to increased economic activity, the provincial government's major energy priority is efficiency. In April of 1987, the provincial government initiated a program to assist industrial energy users to reduce their energy usage. This program was designed to concentrate on an in-depth analysis of the <b>complete</b> operations of <b>industrial</b> <b>plants</b> with the analyses being performed by specialist, private sector, engineering consultants. The program is in 3 phases providing an Ontario <b>industrial</b> <b>plant</b> with an Energy Analysis, a Feasibility Analysis Grant and a Project Engineering Design Grant. In this presentation, the author will outline {{the results of the}} program to date and will attempt to share with the audience the individual case experiences. Since the program's start, the Ontario Ministry of Energy has completed over 320 energy analyses of <b>industrial</b> <b>plants</b> which had combined energy bills of over $ 420 million. The potential annual energy savings identified were over $ 40 million or 9. 51 %. Electricity and natural gas are the major fuels used by Ontario industries and our surveys to date have shown savings of 6 % in electricity and 11 % in natural gas. Over {{the first two years of}} the program, individual plants have or are intending to implement more than half of the energy analysis recommendations...|$|R
