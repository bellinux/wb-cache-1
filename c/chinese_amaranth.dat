40|$|Seven allelochemicals, namely R-(+) -limonene (A), {{vanillin}} (B), xanthoxyline (C), {{vanillic acid}} (D), linoleic acid (E), methyl linoleate (F), and (±) -odorine (G), were investigated for their herbicidal activities on <b>Chinese</b> <b>amaranth</b> (Amaranthus tricolor L.). At 400 μM, xanthoxyline (C) showed the greatest inhibitory activity on seed germination and seedling {{growth of the}} tested plant. Both vanillic acid (D) and (±) -odorine (G) inhibited shoot growth, however, apart from xanthoxyline (C), only vanillic acid (D) could inhibit root growth. Interestingly, R-(+) -limonene (A) lightly promoted root length. Other substances had no allelopathic effect on seed germination and seedling growth of the tested plant. To better understand and optimize the inhibitory effects of these natural herbicides, 21 samples of binary mixtures of these seven compounds were tested at 400 μM using 0. 25 % (v/v) Tween® 80 as a control treatment. The results showed that binary mixtures of R-(+) -limonene:xanthoxyline (A:C), vanillin:xanthoxyline (B:C), and xanthoxyline:linoleic acid (C:E) exhibited strong allelopathic activities on germination and seedling growth of the tested plant, {{and the level of}} inhibition was close to the effect of xanthoxyline (C) at 400 µM and was better than the effect of xanthoxyline (C) at 200 µM. The inhibition was hypothesized to be from a synergistic interaction of each pair of alleochemicals. Mole ratios of each pair of allelochemicals ((A:C), (B:C), and (C:E)) were then evaluated, and the best ratios of the binary mixtures A:C, B:C and C:E were found to be 2 : 8, 2 : 8, and 4 : 6 respectively. These binary mixtures significantly inhibited germination and shoot and root growth of <b>Chinese</b> <b>amaranth</b> at low concentrations. The results reported here highlight a synergistic behavior of some allelochemicals which could be applied in the development of potential herbicides...|$|E
40|$|Yellow-green foliage cultivars of four {{vegetables}} grown outdoors, i. e., Chinese mustard (Brassica rapa), Chinese kale (Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra), {{sweet potato}} (Ipomoea batatas) and <b>Chinese</b> <b>amaranth</b> (Amaranthus tricolor), had lower chlorophyll (Chl) (a+b) (29 - 36 % of green cultivars {{of the same}} species), total carotenoids (46 - 62 %) and ascorbate (72 - 90 %) contents per leaf area. Furthermore, yellow-green cultivars had smaller photosystem II (PSII) antenna size (65 - 70 %) and lower photosynthetic capacity (52 - 63 %), but higher Chl a/b (107 - 156 %) and from low (60 %) to high (129 %) ratios of de-epoxidized xanthophyll cycle pigments per Chl a content. Potential quantum efficiency of PSII (F(v) /F(m)) of all overnight dark-adapted leaves was ca. 0. 8, with {{no significant difference between}} yellow-green and green cultivars of the same species. However, yellow-green cultivars displayed a higher degree of photoinhibition (lower F(v) /F(m) after illumination) when they were exposed to high irradiance. Although vegetables used in this study are of either temperate or tropical origin and include both C(3) and C(4) plants, data from all cultivars combined revealed that F(v) /F(m) after illumination still showed a significant positive linear regression with xanthophyll cycle-dependent energy quenching (q(E)) and a negative linear regression with photoinhibitory quenching (q(I)). F(v) /F(m) was, however, not correlated with nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). Yet, a higher degree of photoinhibition in yellow-green cultivars could recover during the night darkness period, suggesting that the repair of PSII in yellow-green cultivars would allow them to grow normally in the field...|$|E

5000|$|In ancient Greece, the {{amaranth}} (also called chrysanthemum and helichrysum) was {{sacred to}} Ephesian Artemis.

40|$|This work {{reports on}} the levels of cadmium, lead, copper, {{manganese}} and zinc in 174 samples from eight varieties of green vegetables (<b>amaranth,</b> <b>Chinese</b> cabbage, cowpea leaves, green pepper, leafy cabbage, lettuce, okra and pumpkin leaf) commonly grown in Dar es Salaam and marketed at Kariakoo, Tanzania. The amount of cadmium and lead ranged between 3 - 42 and 11 - 60 µg/kg respectively. The amount of copper, manganese and zinc ranged between 0. 35 - 2. 12, 1. 01 - 7. 57, and 1. 19 - 6. 33 µg/kg respectively. On average consumption pattern, the contribution of these vegetables to the recommended daily intakes (RDI) for cadmium and lead ranges from 0. 5 - 10. 8 % and 0. 1 - 4. 0 %, respectively. The contribution of these vegetables for copper, manganese and zinc to the recommended daily intake is observed to mostly be less than 20 %. The estimated dietary intakes through these vegetables show {{that they may be}} considered as an appreciable source of both heavy metals and essential trace elements due to their extensive consumption...|$|R
