This sound which we had heard seemed to show that Toussac had also known how to open it. But suppose that he had closed it behind him. I remembered its size and the iron <b>clampings</b> which bound it together. It was {{possible}} that even {{at the last moment}} we might find ourselves face to face with an insuperable obstacle. On and on we hurried in the dark, and then suddenly I could have raised a shout of joy, for there in the distance was a yellow glimmer of light, only visible in contrast with the black darkness which lay between. The door was open. In his mad thirst for vengeance Toussac had never given a thought to the pursuers at his heels.|$|E
60|$|Walk {{beyond the}} town. You find the shore {{protected}} {{for a long}} way by a sea-wall, lest it should be eaten away by the waves. What the force of those waves can be, even on that sheltered coast, you may judge--at least you could have judged this time last year--by the masses of masonry torn from their iron <b>clampings</b> during the gale of three winters since. Look steadily at those rolled blocks, those twisted stanchions, if they are there still; and then ask yourselves- -it will be fair reasoning from the known to the unknown--What effect must such wave-power as that have had beating and breaking {{for thousands of years}} along the western coasts of England, Scotland, Ireland? It must have eaten up thousands of acres--whole shires, may be, ere now. Its teeth are strong enough, and it knows neither rest nor pity, the cruel hungry sea. Give it but time enough, and what would it not eat up? It would eat up, in the course of ages, all the dry land of this planet, were it not baffled by another counteracting force, of which I shall speak hereafter.|$|E
40|$|Sulfation of {{the natural}} {{polysaccharide}} curdlan results in anticoagulantly active beta- 1, 3 -glucan sulfates whose activity depends on various structural parameters. In this study the anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects {{of one of these}} beta- 1, 3 -glucan sulfates (GS) were compared with those of a porcine mucosal heparin. GS produced a concentration dependent anticoagulant effect in all the global coagulation assays {{with the exception of the}} anti-Xa assay. The best activity was found in the APTT and the thrombin time assays indicating that protease generation and the direct inhibition of thrombin may be sites of actions of this agent. Whereas the anticoagulant activity of GS was approximately 5 fold lower compared to heparin, a 32 fold higher concentration (ED 50 = 550 micrograms/kg) was needed for an antithrombotic effect similar to heparin (ED 50 = 17. 2 micrograms/kg) in a rabbit model of stasis thrombosis. In contrast to this, when a rat model of clamping induced jugular vein occlusion was used to produce vascular obstruction, GS produced similar antithrombotic actions to heparin. At a 250 micrograms/kg dosage, both agents doubled the number of <b>clampings</b> required for complete vascular obstruction. Since the mechanical injury to the blood vessel is the primary determinant of the thrombogenic response, GS may inhibit some of the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the occlusion of the blood vessel. The current study also points to the fact that the global anticoagulant effects may not reflect the antithrombotic potential of newer sulfated carbohydrate derived drugs...|$|E

RECENT ADVANCES IN NEUROSCIENCE HAVE CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY IN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY INVOLVED AND HAVE OPENED THE WAY FOR IMPROVED NEYROPROTECTION DURING THESE OPERATIONS. THE FIRST PART OF THIS THESIS DEALS WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE CLINICAL PROBLEM,FOCUSING ON PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND REVIEWING THE VARIOUS METHODS OF NEUROPROTECTION. THE EXPERIMENTAL PART IS DIVIDED IN TWO SECTIONS. IN THE FIRST SECTION,A BABOON MODEL OF SPINAL CORD ISCHEMIA PRODUCED BY AORTIC <b>CLAMPING</b> IS DESCRIBED. IN THIS MODEL, THE EFFECT OF NORMOTHERMIC AND HYPOTHERMIC SPINAL CORD ISCHEMIA ON SPINAL CORD BLOOD FLOW AND ON FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME IS EXAMINED. IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENTAL SECTION,THE ROLE OF THE EXCITATORY AMINO ACIDS IN SPINAL CORD ISCHEMIA IS STUDIED ON A SWINE MODEL OF SPINAL CORD ISCHEMIA. FURTERMORE,THE EFFECT OF PROFOUND HYPOTHEMIA ON THESE AMINO ACIDS IS EXAMINED. THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS CAN BE SUPPORTED ON THE BASIS OF THE FINDINGS OF THESE STUDIES: 1. THE PROTECTIVE EFFECT OF THE HYPOTHERMIA IS ASSOCIATED WITH BLUNTING OF THE HYPEREMIC RESPONSE OF SPINAL CORD BLOOD FLOW IN THE LOWER THORACIC AND THE LUMBAR SEGMENTS OF THE SPINAL CORD AFTER UNCLAMPING OF THE AORTA. 2. PROFOUND HYPOTHERMIA PRODUCED BY HYPOTHERMIC CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS IS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF PROTECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD FROM ISCHEMIC INJURY. 3.

40|$|Dear Editor, We {{read with}} {{interest}} the article by Verbeek L. et al [1], showing that the second-born twin has higher levels of hemoglobin (Hb) than first-born co-twins after vaginal delivery (VD; Hb differential effect does not occur in twins delivered by Caesarean section. Since Hb difference is present in both uncomplicated monochorionic (MC) and dichorionic (DC) twin pairs, authors focused on the time difference of umbilical cord <b>clampings</b> (UCC) for the two twins, rather than vascular anastomoses (absent in DC twins). Precise timing data unfortunately were not recorded. However, beside UCC timing, other factors {{should be taken into}} account for the VD management. Recent observations have provided compelling evidence demonstrating that UCC timing is not the only determinant of net placental -to-infant blood transfusion [2]; uterine contractions and lung aeration result to be determinant factors influencing umbilical artery and venous blood flows[2]. Specifically the uterine contractions during the third stage of labor significantly increase the placental-to-neonatal gradient and may facilitate 50 % of placental transfusion [3]; such effect is also reported in single term neonates when the "two step" head-to-body delivery method is used [4]. In our opinion, uterine contractions can affect the placental transfusion more than UCC timing in the vaginally born twins: the second-born twin is exposed to the contractions that lead to the birth of the first twin! These additional contractions can increase the placental transfusion and the risk of polycithemia both in DC and MC twins; moreover, in second-born MC twin, contractions can determine acute inter-twin blood transfusion through placental vascular anastomoses. In agreement with authors [1], targeted studies in the twins delivered vaginally should be carried out to establish the optimal UCC timing; anyway we recommend evaluating also the effect of uterine contractions as well as medications administered to the mothers, such as oxytocin-like components...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess left {{ventricular}} segmental wall motion (SWM) abnormalities during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and its impact on the immediate postoperative outcome. Transesophageal echocardiography was used intraoperatively in 27 patients (mean age 57 years) who had CABG without CPB. Images obtained with a 5 -MHz biplane transesophageal echocardiographic probe in the transgastric and transesophageal planes were recorded before, during, and after 48 coronary artery <b>clampings</b> for saphenous vein or internal mammary artery anastomosis. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed 1 day before surgery and on the seventh postoperative day. During the 48 coronary artery clamplngs, 31 (64 %) new SWM abnormalities were found. At the time of chest closure, complete recovery occurred in 16 (50 %) segments, partial recovery in 10 (33 %), and no recovery in 5 (17 %). On the seventh postoperative day the flew SW abnormalities persisted in all 5 segments without recovery at the end of the surgery and in 2 of 10 (20 %) segments with partial recovery(group 1). Group 1 had higher variation on the echocardiographic point score index between the beginning and end of surgery, higher enzymatic levels, more ST-T changes on the electrocardiogram, and more clinical problems than group 2 (patients without new SWM abnormalities on the seventh postoperative day) (P <. 05). We concluded that flew SWM abnormalities of the left ventricle occur during CABG without CPB as assessed by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. Persistence of these abnormalities at the end of surgery may be a predictor of SWM dysfunction and clinical problems in the immediate postoperative period.
