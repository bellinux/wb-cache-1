40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} of the paper is to provide the overview {{of the principle of}} operation and designing approach that is used to design the <b>conical</b> corrugated <b>horn</b> antenna. This paper deals with the designing of the <b>conical</b> corrugated <b>horn</b> with large aperture and narrow flare angle of 15 degree using brass plates that would produce symmetric radiation patterns, good impedance match and low crosspolarisation which would be used as feed horn for the Cassegrain antenna working at 35. 6 GHz for cloud radar. The final design using High Frequency Simulator System (HFSS), shows successful simulated results with symmetrical E and H radiation patterns with good impedance match and low cross polar levels.

40|$|The field {{patterns}} in the aperture {{and in front of}} the mouth of <b>conical</b> <b>horns,</b> with small flare angles, under TEll excitation, are measured. In the aperture, electric and magnetic fields are determined, both in the E and H-planes, for effective apertures, varying in diameter from 5 to 8. Field {{patterns in}} the Fresnel region are taken for horns, having mouth diameters of 5 and 8. Measurements are given, as well, for a square horn, of aperture 8 to a side, under TEIO excitation. Deviations, from the field values in a horn of infinite length, occur in the electromagnetic field in front of the horn and in the aperture. These deviations are ascribed to diffraction, and to the possible existence of higher modes. Similar pertubation {{patterns in the}} aperture are obtained for <b>conical</b> <b>horns,</b> whose diameters differ by 2. Some Fresnel field measurements are compared with calculations, by the method of Kirchhoff and by Lommel. If the correct variation in the incident field is taken into account, favourable agreement is obtained, for patterns sufficiently far from the aperture. Results are in terms of Lommel's universal co-ordinates...|$|R

The instrument contains 2 arrays, one of 91 pixels optimized for 438 microns and the second of 37 pixels optimized for 855 microns. Both are hexagonally close-packed, with each pixel having diffraction-limited angular resolution. <b>Conical</b> <b>horns</b> and single-moded waveguides are used to couple to the submillimeter beams, minimizing the bolometer background loading.

OMA developed out of the infamous “Oswalds Mill Tube and Speaker Tasting”, a yearly event held in the 18th-century mill owned by Weiss in New Tripoli, PA.

50|$|Since the {{transmitters}} and receivers on Telstar {{were not}} powerful, ground antennas {{had to be}} huge. Bell Laboratory engineers designed a large horizontal <b>conical</b> <b>horn</b> antenna with a parabolic reflector at its mouth that re-directed the beam. This particular design had very low sidelobes, and thus made very low receiving system noise temperatures possible. The aperture of the antennas was 3600 sq ft. The antennas were 177 ft long and weighed 380 short ton kg. Morimi Iwama and Jan Norton of Bell Laboratories {{were in charge of}} designing and building the electrical portions of the azimuth-elevation system that steered the antennas. The antennas were housed in radomes the size of a 14-story office building. Two of these antennas were used, one in Andover, Maine, and the other in France at Pleumeur-Bodou. The GPO antenna at Goonhilly Downs in Great Britain was a conventional 26-meter-diameter paraboloid.|$|E

40|$|The {{systematic}} {{position of}} the Anoa is discussed, with reference to its nomenclature and taxonomic history. Two distinct types of Anoa are found all over Celebes, a large one with white legs, long tail and rugged horns, and a small one with legs mainly the same colour as the body, short tail and <b>conical</b> <b>horns.</b> There is some indication that the small Anoa inhabits mountainous areas. In {{the absence of any}} evidence of intergradation they must be classed as two distinct species; since the Anoa is closely related to the Indian Buffalo and the Tamarao, the two must be called Bubalus (Anoa) depressicornis and B.

5000|$|The X-Band has two {{simultaneously}} observable dual polarization sub-bands from 8.18 - 8.65 GHz {{called the}} Standard band and from 8.65 - 8.98 GHz called the expanded band. The X-Band receiver {{consists of a}} smooth walled <b>conical</b> <b>horn</b> and was designed by the Antenna Group at the Technical University of Madrid. The horn antenna is then coupled to a waveguide to coaxial polariser that separates out the two orthogonal components of the incoming circularly polarised beam. The two linear polarisations are then fed directly to two low noise cryogenically cooled amplifiers. Following 2nd stage amplification, conditioning and filtering the astronomical signal is mixed with a Local Oscillator signal to give a 500 MHz IF in the standard band and a 330 MHz IF bandwidth in the expanded band. This IF is then re-routed to the backends {{in the control room}} some 5 metres below via a cable wrap. A phasecal signal can also be injected to the IF module to remove phase errors.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{instrument}} {{is used in}} modern brass bands and marching bands, and is more accurately called a [...] "marching mellophone" [...] or mellophone. A derivative of the F alto horn, it is keyed in F. It is shaped like a flugelhorn, with piston valves played with the right hand and a forward-pointing bell.

It is primarily used as the middle voice of drum and bugle corps. Though they are usually played with a V-cup cornet-like mouthpiece, their range overlaps the common playing range of the horn.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} practical recording technologies {{were entirely}} mechanical devices. These recorders typically used a large <b>conical</b> <b>horn</b> {{to collect and}} focus the physical air pressure of the sound waves produced by the human voice or musical instruments. A sensitive membrane or diaphragm, located {{at the apex of}} the cone, was connected to an articulated scriber or stylus, and as the changing air pressure moved the diaphragm back and forth, the stylus scratched or incised an analogue of the sound waves onto a moving recording medium, such as a roll of coated paper, or a cylinder or disc coated with a soft material such as wax or a soft metal. These early recordings were necessarily of low fidelity and volume, and captured only a narrow segment of the audible sound spectrum — typically only from around 250 Hz up to about 2,500 Hz — so musicians and engineers were forced to adapt to these sonic limitations. Bands of the period often favored louder instruments such as trumpet, cornet and trombone, lower-register brass instruments (such as the tuba and the euphonium) replaced the string bass, and blocks of wood stood in for bass drums; performers also had to arrange themselves strategically around the horn to balance the sound, and to play as loudly as possible. The reproduction of domestic phonographs was similarly limited in both frequency-range and volume — this period gave rise to the expression [...] "put a sock in it", which commemorates the common practice of placing a sock in the horn of the phonograph to muffle the sound for quieter listening. By the end of the acoustic era, the disc had become the standard medium for sound recording, and its dominance in the domestic audio market lasted {{until the end of the}} 20th century.|$|E

Their shape allows players to fit mallets between {{second and third}} fingers of loosely open hands and strike and dampen keys simultaneously with minute, rotating motions of the forearms.

40|$|In slowly flaring horns {{the wave}} fronts can be {{considered}} approximately plane and the input impedance can be calculated with the transmission line method (short cones in series). In a rapidly flaring horn the kinetic energy of transverse flow adds to the local inertance, resulting in an effective increase in length when it {{is located in a}} pressure node. For low frequencies corrections are available. These fail at higher frequencies when cross-dimensions become comparable to the wavelength, causing resonances in the cross-direction. To investigate this, the pipe radiating in outer space is modelled with a finite difference method. The outer boundaries must be fully absorbing as the walls of an anechoic chamber. To achieve this, Berenger’s perfectly matched layer technique is applied. Results are presented for <b>conical</b> <b>horns,</b> they are compared with earlier published investigations on flanges. The input impedance changes when the largest cross-dimension (outer diameter of flange or diameter of the horn end) becomes comparable to half a wavelength. This effect shifts the position of higher modes in the pipe, influencing the conditions for mode locking, important for ease of playing, dynamic range and sound quality...|$|R
40|$|As {{we saw in}} the {{preceding}} sections, simple cylindrical feedhorns for dishes, like the “coffee-can” type, usually have radiation patterns with poor front-to-back ratio. The backward radiation misses the reflector, resulting in a decrease in efficiency and thus gain. The unwanted backward radiation is a result of edge currents in the rim of the horn. Plain rectangular and <b>conical</b> <b>horns</b> also have undesired lobes due to edge currents. In previous sections, we also saw choke rings employed to reduce the magnitude of the undesired lobes, and corrugated horn walls to reduce the magnitude of the edge currents and thus the undesired lobes caused by the currents. Another technique for edge current reduction is to propagate and radiate additional waveguide modes in a horn. With the proper magnitude and phase, these modes may be used to shape the radiation pattern for better illumination of the dish. 6. 5. 1 W 2 IMU dual-mode feedhorn The W 2 IMU dual-mode horn eliminates undesired currents in the rim of the horn which produce sidelobes and backlobes.
