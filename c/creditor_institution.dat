40|$|This thesis {{examines}} four discrete {{periods of}} sovereign default and restructuring {{over the past}} 135 years and seeks to explain the observed variation in aggregated bargaining outcomes between debtor states and private creditors. Utilizing a power-based analytical framework borrowed from Barnett and Duvall (2005), the study assesses the relative impact of four principal regime components on distributional results: the private creditor representative body (institutional power); the degree and orientation of creditor country government/IFI intervention (compulsory power); the structure and condition of the capital markets (structural power); and, the discursive practices surrounding sovereign default (productive power). The analysis suggests that the key private <b>creditor</b> <b>institutions</b> - the British Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, the American Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, and The London Club - have only marginally influenced results, and that outcomes were instead driven by the action (or inaction) of creditor governments, the structure of capital access (centralized or decentralized), and the relative condition of the private capital markets (robust or collapsed). The paper concludes that compulsory and structural regime elements are therefore more salient than institutional ones in the sovereign debt bargaining exercise. From a public policy perspective, this study cautions those who seek a newly-constituted, 21 st-century bondholder council, since such an institution - like its historical predecessors - would find {{its impact on the}} sovereign debt management process highly circumscribed. The thesis also challenges economic theory on the matter of sovereign repayment incentives, arguing that the "either-or" nature of the reputation-sanctions debate (Eaton-Gersovitz (1981) vs. Bulow-Rogoff (1989)) distracts from the fact that these incentives have operated simultaneously over the past 135 years. More specifically, the evidence suggests that structural and compulsory regime elements - the equivalent of reputation and sanctions in the formal models - have largely reinforced one another in the sovereign debt restructuring process, thereby amplifying their impact on negotiating outcomes in each historical period...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} creditor protection on the volatility of stock market returns. Our application of the Tobin’s q model predicts that credit protection reduces the probability of oscillations between binding and nonbinding states of the credit constraint, which result from liquidity crises and their aftermath. In this way creditor protection regulation reduces the stock market price volatility. We test this prediction by using cross-country panel regressions of the stock return volatility, in 40 countries, over the period from 1984 to 2004. Estimated probabilities of big shocks to liquidity are used as a forecast of a switch from a credit–unconstrained to a credit-constrained regime. We find support for the hypothesis that <b>creditor</b> protection <b>institutions</b> reduce the probability of oscillations between binding and nonbinding states of the credit constraint and thereby help reduce the asset price volatility. collateral; Credit constrained regimes; probability of liquidity crisis...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the effect of {{political}} connections versus founding family ownership on the relationship between disproportional ownership structure and leverage decisions of privately owned firms listed in Chinese market. We find that disproportional ownership has positive effect on leverage, indicating that controlling shareholder tends to use both disproportional ownership structure and debt to expropriate. We also find that the interacted term between disproportional ownership and political connections has a positive impact on leverage ratio, and disproportional ownership structure is negatively related with leverage ratio of founding-family controlled firms, which indicate a substitute effect between political connections and founding-family ownership for the impact of disproportional ownership on leverage ratio. Finally, we provide evidence that controlling shareholder of firms with disproportional ownership structure tends to use more related party loans for tunnelling. We argue that under China‟s weak <b>creditor</b> protection <b>institutions,</b> political connections of chairman or CEO provide better access to financing for private-owned firms, but also provide excess external resources for controlling shareholder to expropriate. However, founding-family ownership can largely mitigate the tunnelling effect of controlling shareholder while privately controlled firms through taking-over from former State owned firms tends to facilitate the tunnelling effect of controlling shareholder through its political connections...|$|R

But until broader solutions for problems in sovereign debt are available, there are compelling grounds for other courts to apply the NML precedent as narrowly as possible.

40|$|This paper assesses {{proposals}} {{to redefine the}} scope of activities of systemically important financial institutions. Alongside reform of prudential regulation and oversight, these have been offered as solutions to the too-important-to-fail problem. It is argued that while the more radical of these proposals such as narrow utility banking do not adequately address key policy objectives, two concrete policy measures - the Volcker Rule in the United States and retail ring-fencing in the United Kingdom - are more promising while still entailing significant implementation challenges. A risk factor common to all the measures {{is the potential for}} activities identified as too risky for retail banks to migrate to the unregulated parts of the financial system. Since this could lead to accumulation of systemic risk if left unchecked, it appears unlikely that any structural engineering will lessen the policing burden on prudential authorities and on the banks.

40|$|Hedging {{involves}} {{the transfer of}} an unwanted risk to another party in return either for a payment or for taking on a preferred risk. Although hedging has the benefi t of reducing exposure to a particular risk, it comes {{at the cost of}} giving up the opportunity to benefi t from the exposure. In the case of credit, creditors can hedge credit risk by means of credit default swaps and certain other instruments. Hedging credit means that the protection buyer gives up exposure to default by the reference entity, but it also means that the protection buyer gives up the opportunity to profi t from exposure to the reference entity’s credit. As a general matter, the ability to hedge credit risk, and the resulting facilitation of credit risk diversifi cation, has been welcomed as a useful and benefi cial innovation that enhances the safety and soundness of the fi nancial system (Greenspan 2004, Berner 2007). Professors Henry Hu and Bernard Black, however, have advanced a hypothesis regarding the effect of hedging credit risk on the behavior of <b>creditors</b> of distressed <b>institutions</b> (Hu and Black 2008 a, 2008 b).

40|$|The IMF {{must change}} its {{sanction}} and incentive systems {{so that the}} next crisis {{is more likely to}} be prevented. It should concentrate more on ex ante prevention, which can be done by clearly specifying the rules that will be applied ex post. It should also rely more on automatic mechanisms that operate through the market in order to get to the roots of a potential crisis. Ex post, i. e., when a currency crisis has already occurred, the IMF can only play a limited role in mitigating the crisis. The IMF cannot play the same role for sovereign <b>creditors</b> as national <b>institutions</b> do in the case of illiquidity of domestic banks and firms. It cannot take over the role of a bankruptcy court judge. The IMF cannot credibly play the role of a lender of last resort. First, the lender of last resort lends to financial institutions, while the IMF lends to national governments when they run into trouble. Second, the national lender of last resort can print money and can thus credibly stop a crisis. For the IMF, this is not possible. Therefore, the central banks will have to play the role of a lender of last resort in a coordinated action if a systemic crisis for the world economy develops. The IMF is involved only initially, somewhat easing the task of the true lender of last resort, the central banks. Ex post, the crisis has to be mitigated in such a way that dealing with the crisis does not generate processes and behavior that give rise to the next currency crisis. The IMF should avoid setting wrong incentives. -The IMF should not make up for national political mistakes and national institutional deficiencies. -The IMF should change its policy and not implicitly defend a pegged exchange rate. -The IMF should stop lending to countries that are in arrears to private creditors and bondholders (sovereign arrears) and should return to its previous policy. -The IMF should rule out credits to sovereign debtors if the government of a country takes over guarantees for nonperforming private loans, thus socializing private default risks. -The IMF should think about scaling down its level of operations. This recommendation is in stark contrast to the somewhat expansionist doctrine now being propagated by the IMF. Ex ante, some new rules should be established. In analogy to the "polluter-pays principle" of environmental economics, a "troublemaker-pays principle" should be used. This would hopefully internalize the social costs caused by countries behaving in a manner that generates instability and adds to the risk of a systemic crisis. - The IMF should improve its early warning system, create more transparency, and provide more information, including high-frequency debt-monitoring systems. The international community should intensify discussions on standards that countries would have to follow. -The IMF should specify the sanctions to be levied when standards are not respected. A penalty rate should be charged if additional credit is provided. Requiring collateral would also be a strong incentive to sovereign borrowers to build up assets. - The IMF should define the policy it would pursue in the case of a crisis more credibly. It should move away from the discretionary decisions of its case-by-case approach (favored by US pragmatism) and bind itself by rules (favored by the Europeans). One way to improve credibility of IMF policy would be to rely more on automatic mechanisms that internalize the external effects of national instability behavior. Thus, the IMF should not be a silent supervisor who deliberates behind closed doors. It is better to blow the whistle and apply the brakes before the train crashes. Involving the private sector in the case of a crisis is an important means of internalizing the social costs of instability. In contrast to the mostly used American-style bonds, British-style trustee deed bonds are more appropriate to manage crises as they include sharing clauses and majority rules. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} dilemma {{emanates from}} the inadequacy and weakly detailed turnaround models {{available for use}} by entrepreneurs and turnaround practitioners in South Africa. To add to this problem previous legislation did not provide any protection to the debtor in any turnaround attempts. New debtor friendly legislation comes into effect in 2011. This research aims to identify the verifiers for signs and causes of potential failure. The construct verifier determinant is theoretically defined and included into a practical turnaround framework. The primary objectives of the study are to: Identify and theoretically define early warning sign “verifier determinants” To design and include “verifier determinants” {{as an integral part}} of a turnaround plan that supports corrective action. The secondary objectives of this study are to: Research the current formal turnaround practices, which are applied in the United States of America, Canada, Australia, Africa and informal practices evident in South Africa. These findings are aligned to include the changes in the applicable South African legislation. Design and propose a framework for use by turnaround practitioners and entrepreneurs alike (conforming to new legislation). Identify which “verifier determinants” will confirm the early warning and apply this outcome to the design of a reliable turnaround framework, acceptable to all <b>creditors</b> and financial <b>institutions.</b> The final objective is to contribute to the South African entrepreneurial, turnaround body of knowledge, and future formal studies in this academically ill-represented field. The effectiveness of business turnaround depends on the chosen strategy. The literature review in this proposal deals with the following aspects; venture risk propensity, early warning signs and failure models, legal constraints / opportunities and finally turnaround. Current formal turnaround routes are, due to various negativities and high costs, often not practical and a more informal approach is favoured. Methodology: Through comprehensive literature research to identify and theoretically define “verifier determinants” that confirm the early warning sign and causes. Apply in depth interviews to identify the use of verifier determinants by specialist turnaround practitioners. Confirm the actual use and value of the verifier determinants by experts and practitioners during turnarounds, Design and include “verifier determinants” {{as an integral part of}} a turnaround framework that supports rehabilitation of the business. Compare the formal turnaround practices, which are applied in other jurisdictions such as the United States of America, Canada, Australia, Africa will be investigated. Adapt the framework cognisant of Chapter six of the companies Act, Act 71 of 2008 requirements and recommend to formal and informal turnaround practices relevant in South Africa. For this study, a leading commercial bank was selected as the organisation of choice, due to the accessibility to information, research data, and turnaround respondents. For selecting the case studies used for evaluation during interviews, the researcher relied on businesses that were already subjected to BASEL II Accord categorisation criteria and had ex post facto histories. The study applied two research methods. An interview method was used to identify actual verifier determinants used in practice. The interrogation of the participants was done, using the Repertory Grid method, thus forcing choices and explanation of interviewee reasoning. Participants were purposely selected to ensure representation within the identified risk categories. As result, a comprehensive turnaround framework is compiled. The study aligns these findings with the new South African legislation, and designs a turnaround framework for use by turnaround professional practitioners, entrepreneurs and affected persons alike. This study introduced a number of new constructs that can be used in a business turnaround context, namely: business triage verifier determinant turnaround framework, introducing the constructs “business triage” and “verifier determinant” a timeline schedule for executing the rescue process This study highlighted the importance of establishing the true value of a business in the early stages of the turnaround process. Verifiers can be used successfully to determine the extent of the problem (“depth of the rot”), the difficulties involved and reduce time requirements for analysis.
