5|$|Pathfinder : This is {{the first}} real {{advancement}} badge. It focuses on basic Scout training, including the six basic knots (Reef Knot, Bowline, Sheet bend, Sheepshank, Figure-of-eight, and <b>Clove</b> <b>hitch),</b> basic first aid (treatment of open wounds and bleeding), and introduces Scouts to camping. The badge encourages a Scout to participate in patrol activities. The Scout is required to have camped away from their normal Scout meeting place {{for at least five}} nights.|$|E

2500|$|The tipi fire-build {{takes some}} {{patience}} to construct. First, the tinder is {{piled up in}} a compact heap. The smaller kindling is arranged around it, like the poles of a tipi. For added strength, {{it may be possible}} to lash some of the sticks together. A tripod lashing is quite difficult to execute with small sticks, so a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> should suffice. [...] (Synthetic rope should be avoided, since it produces pollutants when it burns.) Then the larger kindling is arranged above the smaller kindling, taking care not to collapse the tipi. A separate tipi as a shell around the first one may work better. Tipi fires are excellent for producing heat to keep people warm. The gases from the bottom quickly come to the top as you add more sticks. [...] However, one downside to a Tipi fire is that when it burns, the logs become unstable and can fall over. This is especially concerning with a large fire.|$|E
50|$|Nets were {{formerly}} {{all made}} by hand. They can be started {{from a single}} point, for round nets (such as purse nets, net bags, or hair nets), but square nets are usually started from a headrope. A line {{is tied to the}} headrope at regular intervals, forming a series of loops. This can be done using slipped overhand knots, as in the image above, or using other knots, such as <b>clove</b> <b>hitches.</b> Subsequent rows are then worked using sheet bends, as shown, or another knot (some nets, such as hammocks, may even be looped rather than knotted).|$|R
5000|$|Another {{application}} for the cow hitch {{is in the}} handling of large electric power cable in surface mines. Known colloquially as a [...] "Cableman's hitch", it {{is also used to}} attach loops of cable to the back of a pick-up truck during a shovel move. As the cable can weigh upwards of 22 pounds per foot and 3-4 loops of cable can be attached to one length of rope, a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch's</b> shearing force would damage the cable jacket. The Cableman's hitch puts the strain onto the hitch crossing over the two running ends of the rope.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Endotracheal Tubes (ETTs) are {{commonly}} secured using adhesive tape, cloth tape, or commercial devices. The {{objectives of the}} study were (1) To compare degrees of movement of ETTs secured with 6 different commercial devices and (2) To compare movement of ETTs secured with cloth tape tied with 3 different knots (hitches). Methods A 17 cm diameter PVC tube with 14 mm "mouth" hole in the side served as a mannequin. ETTs were subjected to repeated jerks, using a cable and pulley system. Measurements: (1) Total movement of ETTs relative to "mouth" (measure used for devices) (2) Slippage of ETT through securing knot (measure used for knots). Results Among commercial devices, the Dale ® showed less movement than other devices, although some differences between devices did not reach significance. Among knots, Magnus and <b>Clove</b> <b>Hitches</b> produced less slippage than the Cow Hitch, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion Among devices tested, the Dale ® was most secure. Within the scope offered by the small sample sizes, there were no statistically significant differences between the knots in this study. </p...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a good lad, Jim," [...] he said; [...] "and you're {{all in a}} <b>clove</b> <b>hitch,</b> ain't you? Well, {{you just}} put your trust in Ben Gunn--Ben Gunn's the man to do it. Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch,</b> as you remark?" ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{anything}} {{was better than}} a devil-woman, but I thought her yarn serious enough. Black Jack had no call to be about my house, unless he was set there to watch; and it looked {{to me as if}} my tomfool word about the paint, and perhaps some chatter of Maea's had got us all in a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch.</b> One thing was clear: Uma and I were here for the night; we daren't try to go home before day, and even then it would be safer to strike round up the mountain and come in by the back of the village, or we might walk into an ambuscade. It was plain, too, that the mine should be sprung immediately, or Case might be in time to stop it.|$|E
60|$|The chain sheets held on near a month, {{and then}} gave way. On examination, {{it was found that}} the {{parcelling}} had gone under the ship's counter, and that the copper had nearly destroyed the iron. After this, we mustered all the chains of the ship, of proper size, parcelled them very thoroughly, got another <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> around the rudder as before, and brought the ends to the hawse-holes, letting the bights fall, one on each side of the ship's keel. The ends were next brought to the windlass and hove taut. This answered pretty well, and stood until we got the ship into New York. Our whole passage was stormy, and lasted seventy days, as near as I can recollect. The ship was almost given up when we got in, and great was the joy at our arrival.|$|E
60|$|The wind shifted {{a day or}} {{two after}} this escape, giving us a slant that carried us past Scilly, fairly out into the Atlantic. A {{fortnight}} or so after our interview with the Eddystone we carried away the pintals of the rudder, which was saved only by the modern invention that prevents the head from dropping, by means of the deck. To prevent the strain, and to get some service from the rudder, however, we found it necessary to sling the latter, and to breast it into the stern-post by means of purchases. A spar was laid athwart the coach-house, directly over the rudder, and we rove a chain through the tiller-hole, and passed it over this spar. For this purpose the smallest chain-cable was used, the rudder being raised from the deck by means of sheers. We then got a set of chain-topsail sheets, parcelled them well, and took a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> with them around the rudder, about half-way up. One end was brought into each main-chain, and set up by tackles. In this manner the wheel did tolerably well, though we had to let the ship lie-to in heavy weather.|$|E
50|$|The {{buntline}} hitch {{is simply}} a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> tied around the standing part, with the turns of the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> progressing towards the object.|$|E
50|$|Start {{by tying}} a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> around the spar or pole. Then make an {{additional}} turn {{around with the}} working end, {{in the same direction}} as the turns forming the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch.</b> Now, tuck the working end under the standing part of the original <b>clove</b> <b>hitch.</b> Pull up tight to complete the hitch.|$|E
50|$|RS Lashing {{start with}} <b>Clove</b> <b>hitch</b> on base object an 1 run in another object, then 1 wrap and 1frap and again 1run, 1wrap and 1frap........ end with <b>clove</b> <b>hitch...</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> {{is a type}} of knot. Along {{with the}} bowline and the sheet bend, it is often {{considered}} one of the most important knots and is commonly referred to as a Double Hitch. A <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> is two successive half-hitches around an object. It is most effectively used as a crossing knot. It can be used as a binding knot, but is not particularly secure in that role. [...] A <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> made around the rope's own standing part is known as either two half-hitches or buntline hitch, depending on whether the turns of the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> progress away from or towards the hitched object.|$|E

50|$|A <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> is {{tied around}} the beam with the rope end.|$|E
50|$|Although {{similar in}} {{finished}} appearance to the double bowline, the water bowline is formed with a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> as the loop in the standing {{part of the}} rope. This {{is similar to the}} double bowline, which puts the running end through a round turn. The additional friction from the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> increases the security of this knot.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{slippery}} hitch - a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> with a loop in the end.|$|E
50|$|This knot is also {{sometimes}} referred to as a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> over itself, or double half-hitch.|$|E
50|$|The {{slippery}} hitch {{is effectively}} a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> {{finished with a}} slipped loop. To tie one, begin as for a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch,</b> but instead of passing {{the end of the}} line through the loop in the final step, pass a bight instead, leaving the end on the original side. Pulling on this end will release the hitch. If tied in a gasket, this will quickly release the sail.|$|E
50|$|For example, when a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> ties a boat to a pier, the end {{going to}} the boat is the {{standing}} end.|$|E
5000|$|A {{correctly}} tied two half hitches {{resembles a}} <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> tied around the standing {{end of the}} line, not a cow hitch.|$|E
5000|$|Finish {{with a half}} hitch, {{moving around}} the object in the same {{direction}} as the first turns, as for a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Complete with a half-hitch {{outside the}} loop, {{made in the}} same {{direction}} as the first two wraps, as for a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As {{long as the}} <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> {{can feed}} over the drum, the rope will feed through the device. In a fall, the drum is back driven by the rope as the device slides down the rope; when the drum {{rotation}} exceeds a certain angular velocity, it locks off to the frame {{and the increase in}} friction induced between the stationary drum and the rope causes the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> to rapidly tighten around the locked drum to arrest the fall.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Clove</b> <b>hitch</b> is {{used when}} {{building}} an anchor using {{the rope and}} sometimes to make a climber safe quickly at a belay ledge ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Clove</b> <b>hitch</b> for tying a rope to a pole - {{simple and}} won't jam, but not {{particularly}} secure and won't work on rectangular shapes ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{version is}} {{preferred}} when attaching a rope to pole or rod. [...] It is effectively a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> {{with an extra}} initial turn.|$|E
50|$|The {{buntline}} hitch is a knot {{used for}} attaching a rope to an object. It is formed by passing the working end around an object, then making a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> around the rope's standing part, taking care that the turns of the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> progress towards the object rather than away from it. Secure and easily tied, the buntline hitch will jam when subjected to extreme loads. Given the knot's propensity to jam, {{it is often}} made in slipped form.|$|E
50|$|The lobster buoy hitch {{is similar}} to the {{buntline}} hitch, but made with a cow hitch around the standing part rather than a <b>clove</b> <b>hitch.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> is also {{commonly}} used in pioneering to start and finish a lashing such as the traditional square lashing, tripod lashing, round lashing and sheer lashing.|$|E

50|$|This knot is {{particularly}} useful where {{the length of}} the running end needs to be adjustable, since feeding in rope from either direction will loosen the knot to be tightened at a new position. With certain types of cord, the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> can slip when loaded. In modern climbing rope, the <b>clove</b> <b>hitch</b> will slip to a point, and then stop slipping. With smaller diameter cords, after being heavily weighted it may become difficult to untie. It is also unreliable when used on a square or rectangular post, rather than round.|$|E
