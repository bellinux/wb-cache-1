For example, a service that sends a letter is most reusable when just the <b>customer</b> <b>identifier</b> is passed and the customer address is obtained within the service. This decouples services because services {{do not need to}} be called in a specific order (e.g. GetCustomerAddress, SendLetter) ...|$|E
40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of an ever-changing and challenging operating environment, retailers must {{find new ways to}} attract customers, encourage them to purchase and then gain their loyalty. Despite the growth of multi-channel retailing, the bricks-and-mortar store remains the most important channel, with some 94 percent of retail sales derived from physical stores. Academics, retailers, architects, and interior designers have long acknowledged the positive impact of the in-store experience on customer reactions. Although millions of dollars are invested in refurbishing stores, few retailers evaluate such efforts. The positive impact of store refurbishment on customer reactions is documented in the literature. However, academic inquiry into store refurbishment effects on customers is limited. Existing research does not consider the impact of a store’s “initial reference point” (the condition of the store prior to refurbishment) on customer reactions. Yet {{it is likely that the}} greater the change in a store resulting from refurbishment, the more impactful the refurbishment will be on customer reactions. In addition, past research has not investigated the relative impact of refurbishing specific store attributes on customer reactions. This thesis addresses these gaps in knowledge based on a longitudinal quasi-experiment conducted in the field, involving two stores that underwent a major refurbishment and two matched control stores. Importantly, the treatment stores were of contrasting initial reference points such that one had a Low Initial Reference Point (LIRP) and the other a High Initial Reference Point (HIRP). Thus, two treatment and two control stores were involved in the study, and a customer panel was drawn from a department store’s loyalty program. Psychological and objective data were gathered for each panel member and matched using a unique <b>customer</b> <b>identifier.</b> Psychological data were collected using a longitudinal study and objective transaction data were extracted from the retailer’s loyalty program database. The findings show that refurbishing a LIRP store is more impactful on customers’ psychological responses in the short and medium-term, compared to refurbishing a HIRP store. Both store refurbishments increase customers’ objective spending behaviour in the long-term; however, the impact is significantly greater for a LIRP store (22 % compared to 15 % for a HIRP store). This finding is critical as the bottom line for most retail decisions is the impact on sales. In addition, refurbishing store flooring, exterior design, lighting, and layout drives customers’ psychological responses, however the relative impact of these attributes differs. Moreover, the relative impact of refurbishing these attributes on customers’ psychological responses differs between a LIRP and a HIRP store. For a LIRP store, the refurbishment of lighting drives employee conduct perceptions, flooring and exterior design drives store image perceptions, exterior design and lighting drives store satisfaction perceptions, flooring drives feelings of hedonic value, lighting drives feelings of place attachment, and lighting drives positive WOM intentions. For a HIRP store, the refurbishment of flooring and layout drives employee conduct perceptions, lighting and layout drives store image perceptions, exterior design and layout drives feelings of place attachment, and layout drives positive WOM intentions. These findings represent critical contributions to theory and managerial practice as a store can be refurbished in many ways, but its ultimate success relies in part on consideration of the store’s initial reference point and the key attributes that optimise its overall impact.

40|$|This study aims {{to solve}} Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), which has {{received}} considerable attention in recent years, using hybrid genetic algorithm. Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows {{is an extension}} of the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and involves a fleet of vehicles set-off from a depot to serve a number of customers at different geographic locations with various demands within specific time windows before returning to the depot eventually. To solve this problem, this study suggests a hybrid genetic algorithm combined with Push Forward Insertion Heuristic (PFIH) to make an initial solution and λ-interchange mechanism to neighborhood search and improving method. The proposed genetic algorithm uses an integer representation in which a string of <b>customer</b> <b>identifiers</b> represents the sequence of deliveries covered by each of the vehicles. Part of initial population is initialized using Push Forward Insertion Heuristic (PFIH) and part is initialized randomly. A λ-interchange mechanism interchanges the customers between routes and generates neighborhood solution. At the end, in order to prove the validity of the suggested model, fourteen instances of Solomon`s 56 benchmark problems-selected randomly- are solved and compared with the other meta-heuristic methods. The results indicate the good quality of the method...|$|R

50|$|The {{service order}} process {{utilizes}} the USOC, USO and Field Identifiers (FIDs), to provision, bill and maintain services and equipment. Universal Service Order or USO Codes {{are used by}} telecommunications service providers to collect and structure all the information needed for service activation, including ordering, provisioning, service assurance and billing. USOC codes, also known as rate elements, are used by telecommunications service providers to identify each billable element of a <b>customer’s</b> service. Field <b>Identifiers</b> or FIDs are used by telecommunications service providers to identify a billing preference or attribute of a customer’s account. FIDs define the technical parameters required to provision and bill a customer’s service beyond those described in USOCs.|$|R
40|$|In Multicast Virtual Private Networks (MVPNs), {{customer}} multicast flows {{are carried}} in "tunnels " through a service provider’s network. The base specifications for MVPN define BGP multicast VPN "autodiscovery routes " and specify {{how to use}} an auto-discovery route to advertise {{the fact that an}} individual customer multicast flow is being carried in a particular tunnel. However, those specifications do not provide a way to specify, in a single such route, that multiple customer flows are being carried in a single tunnel. Those specifications also do not provide a way to advertise that a particular tunnel is to be used by default to carry all customer flows, except in the case where that tunnel is joined by all the provider edge routers of the MVPN. This document eliminates these restrictions by specifying the use of "wildcard " elements in the <b>customer</b> flow <b>identifiers.</b> With wildcard elements, a single autodiscovery route can refer to multiple customer flows or even to all customer flows.

40|$|Abstract—The {{support for}} {{mobility}} {{is a major}} requirement for the future Internet. Although several mobility solutions have been proposed, none of them has been largely deployed, mostly {{because they are not}} economically viable. We propose a business oriented mobility framework- Mobility Support Service (MSS) to be offered as a value-added service to paying mobile <b>customers.</b> MSS uses <b>Identifiers</b> (IDs) to locate the nodes and network addresses as points of attachment for the nodes. MSS is a scalable distributed service. MSS does not require changes in existing network architecture nor services. We present two MSS distributing algorithms that enable tradeoffs among costs and QoS. We show by simulations the advantages of MSS compared to existing mobility solutions, especially regarding scalability and service delay. However the main advantage of MSS is that it can be realistically offered, because it is economically viable. I...|$|R
50|$|All Icelanders, as well {{as foreign}} {{citizens}} residing in Iceland and corporations and institutions, have a kennitala (lit. identification number) identifying them in the National Register. The number is composed of 10 digits, of which the first six are the individuals birth date or corporations founding date in the format DDMMYY. The next two digits are chosen at random when the kennitala is allocated, the ninth digit is a check digit, and the last digit indicates the century {{in which the individual}} was born (for instance, 9 for the period 1900-1999, or 0 for the period 2000-2099). An example would be 120174-3399, the person being born on the twelfth day of January 1974. The Icelandic system is similar to that in other Scandinavian and European countries, but the use of the identification number is unusually open and extensive in Iceland. Businesses and universities use the kennitala as a <b>customer</b> or student <b>identifier,</b> and all banking transactions include it. The National Registry (Þjóðskrá) oversees the system. A database matching names to numbers is freely accessible (after login) on all Icelandic online banking sites. Given this openness, the kennitala is never used as an authenticator. It is worth noting that the completeness of the National Register eliminates any need for Iceland to take censuses.|$|R
