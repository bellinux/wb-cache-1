25|$|The {{incomes of}} the poorest {{sections}} of society were increased exponentially {{as a result of}} social security reforms and a 25% increase in the minimum wage. Allowances for the handicapped were also increased, while the right to deduct the cost of <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> all {{children under the age of}} three was introduced (a right later extended to include all children under the age of five in some cases). Unemployed workers ineligible for jobless benefits were given back the right to claim sickness insurance that they had lost in 1979 while the reimbursal of the costs of dental fees, hearing aids, and glasses was improved. An 80-franc-per-month charge that had been imposed on certain long-term illnesses was abrogated, and certain individuals who had retired before 1973 had the base upon which their pensions were calculated adjusted upward. Between 1981 and 1983, the minimum vieillesse (the basic pension benefit for the elderly poor) was raised by 62%.|$|E

25|$|The Presidential Commission on the Status of Women was an {{advisory}} commission established on December 14, 1961, by Kennedy to investigate questions regarding women's equality in education, in the workplace, {{and under the}} law. The commission, chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt until her death in 1962, was composed of 26 members including legislators, labor union activists and philanthropists who were active in women's rights issues. The main purpose of the committee was to document and examine employment policies in place for women. The commission's final report, American Woman (also known as the Peterson Report after the Commission's second chair, Esther Peterson), was issued in October 1963 and documented widespread discrimination against women in the workplace. Among the practices addressed by the group were labor laws pertaining to hours and wages, the quality of legal representation for women, the lack of education and counseling for working women, and federal insurance and tax laws that affected women's incomes. Recommendations included affordable <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> all income levels, hiring practices that promoted equal opportunity for women, and paid maternity leave.|$|E
500|$|Appearing {{before the}} Judiciary Committee on January 19, Baird apologized for having knowingly broken the law: [...] "In my {{hope to find}} {{appropriate}} <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> my son, I gave too little emphasis to what was described {{to me as a}} technical violation of law." [...] She added that, [...] "People are fairly questioning if there are classes of individuals who hold themselves above the law. I do not." [...] Baird's statement that her husband had handled many of the legal issues surrounding the Corderos' employment drew little support for her. Overall, the questioning of Baird was tougher from Democrats on the committee than Republicans, again reflecting the latter's support for Baird. At the close of the initial testimony, Baird's confirmation still seemed quite possible.|$|E

Different aspects of well-being are examined, including how meaningful respondents find their activities and how happy, sad, tired, in pain, and stressed their activities make them. The results show that, controlling for selection into caregiving, most caregiving negatively affects the well-being of retirees. This suggests that policies that {{remove some of the}} caregiving burden from retirees would increase their well-being...|$|R

Clearly, the DCC environment provides a setting condu-cive to increased transmission of infectious disease. DCCs often represent crowded facilities that provide <b>care</b> <b>for</b> an immunological immature population of children that have little notion of basic hygiene. In addition, interventions for infectious disease control are often not available (vaccin-ation), socially undesirable (exclusion) or not effective (cohorting) as small children can be infectious before and after becoming symptomatic [6]. Finally, the infectious dis-ease burden not only concerns the attending child. Day care-associated infectious disease transmission has been considered a public health problem since 1984 [7]. Infec-tious pathogens, including their antiviral or antimicrobial resistance properties, may readily transmit via children, caretakers, parents and families [8] into the society a...|$|R
