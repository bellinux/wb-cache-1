40|$|The {{cases of}} three children, 16, 12, and 12 years of age, who {{suffered}} sudden confusional state and cortical blindness lasting 12 to 30 minutes while under treatment with high-dose methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and dactinomycin for a lower limb osteosarcoma are reported. Transient neuropsychologic deficits arose after the acute phase of treatment: left hemispatial neglect and <b>constructive</b> <b>apraxia</b> (Patient 1); <b>constructive</b> <b>apraxia</b> (Patient 2); and <b>constructive</b> <b>apraxia</b> and alexia without aphasia (Patient 3). The three patients recovered completely from all their deficits within {{the time frame}} of 3 hours to 2 weeks. Arterial hypertension and hypomagnesemia were found during the acute phase in all patients. In Patients 2 and 3, magnetic resonance imaging revealed increased parieto-occipital T 2 signal involving gray and white matter. In Patients 1 and 2, HmPAO-SPECT revealed parieto-occipital hypoperfusion that resolved a few days later. The alterations detected by neuroimaging were concurrent with the appearance and disappearance of the clinical symptoms. Such transient acute episodes have been named occipital-parietal encephalopathy. On {{the basis of our}} clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging findings, an explanation for the origin of this syndrome, a migrainelike mechanism, triggered by chemotherapy-induced hypomagnesemia, is proposed...|$|E

40|$|RESUMENObjetivo: Evaluar un sistema de actividades {{realizadas}} para la corrección y compensación de la apraxia constructiva después de la exploración neuropsicológica. Método: Con el propósito de evaluar este sistema de actividades, se realizó un estudio prospectivo experimental con 15 pacientes que permanecieron en el Centro Internacional de Investigaciones y Restauración Neurológica (CIREN) durante un período de 54 días que recibieron tratamiento defectológico (Terapia Ocupacional) diario. En consecuencia se aplicó una escala evaluativa pre y post-intervención terapéutica comparándose los resultados. Resultados: A través de la escala de puntaje aplicada se obtuvo un incremento de recuperación en cuanto a la realización de las actividades sin niveles de ayuda ni modelos previos de un 93, 4 % post-intervención, como promedio, en los pacientes analizados. Conclusiones: Se observó una mejor asociación entre la idea del movimiento y la ejecución motora así como entre la percepción visual y la acción apropiada, después de la intervención. SUMMARYA {{great number}} of patients with Encephalic Static Lesions suffer psychic and motor alterations that avoid him to develop it more usually possible in his social environment. One of the psychic alterations that are frequently presented is the <b>constructive</b> <b>apraxia</b> which can appear in different grades, depending among other factors, {{of the severity of}} the damage. This unchains difficulties that go from the less complex, as the reproduction of drawings until others of more complexity like daily basic activities. Objectives: Evaluate system of activities for correction and/or compensation the <b>constructive</b> <b>apraxia</b> after neuro-psychological exploration. Methods and Material: With the proposal to check the effectiveness of this system of activities we carry out a prospective and experimental study with 15 patients that were in CIREN (International Centre of Research and Neurological Restoration) for a period of 54 days in occupational and language therapy with a daily frequency, we apply an evaluative scale before and after the treatment, whose results were analyzed comparatively. Results: Trough the applied scale we observed a 93, 4 % increase post-intervention like average in intervenes patients. Conclusions: After the treatment we observed a better association between moment idea and the movement properly saying as well as between visual perception and the appropriat...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{the results of}} a {{multiple}} single cases study in which we examined the ability to produce routine activities of daily living in old adults with movement disorders, i. e. Parkinson disease and corticobasal degeneration. An adapted version of the naturalistic Action Test (NAT) was used to measure everyday action impairment associated with neurological pathologies. Patients performance on tasks tapping <b>constructive</b> and ideomotor <b>apraxia</b> is not associated with NAT performance; information drawn from IADL questionnaires describes similar patterns of functional outcome. A specific distribution of errors was observed in frontal lobes patients. The study underlines also the usefulness and specificity of information gathered from a naturalistic assessment of action executio...|$|R
40|$|Apraxia is a {{well-known}} syndrome characterized by the sufferer’s inability to perform routine gestures. In an attempt to understand the syndrome better, various different theories have been developed {{and a number of}} classifications of different subtypes have been proposed. In this paper review, we will address these theories with a specific focus on how the use of objects helps us to better understand upper limb apraxia. With this aim, we will consider transitive versus intransitive action dissociation as well as less frequent types of apraxia involving objects, i. e. <b>constructive</b> <b>apraxia</b> and magnetic apraxia. Pantomime and the imitation of objects in use are also considered with a view to dissociating the various different components involved in upper limb apraxia. Finally, we discuss the evidence relating to action recognition and awareness of errors in the execution of actions. Various different components concerning the use of objects emerge from our analysis and the results show that knowledge of an object and sensory-motor representations are supported by other functions such as spatial and body representations, executive functions and monitoring systems...|$|E
40|$|It {{is still}} {{a matter of debate}} whether <b>constructive</b> <b>apraxia</b> (CA) should be {{considered}} a form of apraxia or, rather, the motor expression of a more pervasive impairment in visuo-spatial processing. Constructive disorders were linked to visuo-spatial disorders and to deficits in appreciating spatial relations among component sub-parts or problems in reproducing three-dimensionality. We screened a large population of brain-damaged patients for CA. Only patients with constructive disorders and no signs of neglect and/or aphasia were selected. Five apractic subjects were tested with both visuo-spatial and verbal tasks requiring constructive abilities. The former ones were tests such as design copying, while the latter were experimental tasks built to transpose into the linguistic domain the constructive process as phrasing by arranging paper scraps into a sentence. A first result showed a constructive impairment in both the visuo-spatial and the linguistic domain; this finding challenges the idea that CA is confined to the visuo-spatial domain. A second result showed a systematic association between CA and unawareness for constructive disorders. Third, lack of awareness was always associated with a lesion in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region deemed as involved in managing a conflict between intentions and sensory feed-back. Anosognosia for constructive disorders and the potential role of the right prefrontal cortex in generating the impairment, are discussed in the light of current models of action control. The core of CA could be the inability to detect any inconsistency between intended and executed action rather than a deficit in reproducing spatial relationship. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} the clinical manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) {{in patients with}} alcohol liver cirrhosis (ALC) in exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (CB). Materials and methods. 100 patients with ALC class B and C according to Child-Pugh, 82. 00 % of men and 18. 00 % of women aged (47. 2 ± 3. 9) years, were examined: 48 patients without combination with CB (group I); 52 patients on the background of CB exacerbation (group II). Clinical-laboratory and instrumental examination was performed. The West-Haven criteria {{were used to assess}} the HE. Results. In 54. 17 % of patients in group І, the I degree of HE was determined, in 35. 42 % – the ІІ degree, in 10. 42 % – the ІІІ degree. In patients of group ІІ the HE of the І degree was found in 17. 31 %, the ІІ degree – in 50. 0 %, the ІІІ degree – in 32. 69 % (p< 0. 05). In patients with ALC and ALC in combination with CB, respectively, clinically HE was manifested by drowsiness in the daytime and the inversion of sleep (58. 33 %; 75. 00 %), lengthening the duration of the TMT-time test (61. 59 ± 2. 38 sec; 72. 84 ± 3. 03 sec), mood disorders (20. 83 %; 28. 85 %), appearance of asterixis (54. 17 %; 76. 92 %), <b>constructive</b> <b>apraxia</b> (41. 67 %; 55. 77 %). Conclusions. 1. Exacerbation of CB in patients with ALC contributes to the increase in the degree of HE, worsening the prognosis. 2. The relationship between the hyponatremia and the degree of HE is revealed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Frontal/executive {{dysfunction}} commonly {{occurs in}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease - Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI patients). However, to date, {{the number of}} studies comparing PD-MCI and MCI patients of other etiologies are too small. The present study aims at clarifying the attention/working memory and executive dysfunction of PD-MCI patients in comparison to amnestic MCI multiple domain patients with first extended then abbreviated structural brain changes suggesting preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease. Subjects and methods: 40 PD-MCI patients and 40 amnestic MCI multiple domain (aMCI+) patients were diagnosed according to the International guidelines. 22 healthy subjects were also recruited as control group. The groups were assessed by a wide neuropsychological battery, including measures of attention/working memory (Digit Span and Stroop Test), executive functions (Tower of London-Drexel Version -TOLDX- and Brixton Test), language (Boston Naming Test and Category Fluency), memory (Prose Recall and Pairs Associates Learning), and visuospatial function (Street 2 ̆ 7 s Completion Test and <b>Constructive</b> <b>Apraxia</b> Test). Performances were compared by non parametric tests. Spearman correlations were performed to explore association between neuropsychological measures of attention/working memory and executive functions in PD-MCI group. Results: The PD-MCI patients performed worse on Digit Span and Stroop Interference/Error than aMCI+ and controls. AMCI+ patients, in turn, showed a greater deficit on TOLDX Initiation Time and on Violation Time than PD-MCI and controls. Both PDMCI and aMCI+ patients reported lower scores on Stroop Interference/Time than controls. Moreover, aMCI+ patients performed worse then controls on Brixton Test. Positive correlations between Digit Span and Stroop Interference/Error, Stroop Interference/Error and TOLDX Execution Time, Total Time and Violation Time, Stroop Interference Time and TOLDX Move Score and Total Time were found in PD-MCI group. Conclusion: PD-MCI patients mainly present a conscious attention defect and an inhibitory control deficit than aMCI+. PDMCI patients with deficits in attention/working memory domain should undergo specific cognitive trainings {{in order to improve}} cognitive abilities and prevent Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s Disease Dementia onset...|$|E
