40|$|Statistical {{speech and}} {{language}} processing techniques, requiring {{large amounts of}} training data, are currently state-of-the-art in automatic speech recognition. For high-resourced, international languages this data is widely available, while for under-resourced languages the lack of data poses serious problems. Unsupervised acoustic modeling can offer a cost and time effective way of creating a solid acoustic model for any under-resourced language. This study describes a novel unsupervised acoustic model training method and evaluates it on speech data in an under-resourced language: Romanian. The key novel factor of the method is the usage of two <b>complementary</b> <b>seed</b> ASR systems to produce high quality transcriptions, with a Character Error Rate (ChER) < 5 %, for initially untranscribed speech data.

40|$|Scarcity and/or {{high cost}} of healthy seed yams are the {{greatest}} constraints in yam production in Nigeria and probably across the West African Yam belt. Scientists at the National Root Crops Research Umudike developed the yam minisett technique of seed yam production in 1982 but nearly three decades after, the adoption rate of this technology is still below 40 %. Concerned about this development, the World Bank mission to Nigeria supervising the National Agricultural Research Projects (NARP) in 1997 wondered why Nigeria could not develop effective systems that would ensure rapid adoption of this proven technology or develop <b>complementary</b> <b>seed</b> yam propagation technologies that would enable farmers {{to gain access to}} newly released, high yielding yam varieties soon after release. This paper, therefore, discusses the progress made so far in promoting the yam minisett technique and three other technologies (minituber, vine-cuttings and peelsett) developed to complement the yam minisett technique.

40|$|Animal {{movement}} and behaviour is fundamental for ecosystem functioning. The process of seed dispersal by frugivorous animals is {{a showcase for}} this paradigm since their behaviour shapes the spatial patterns of the earliest stage of plant regeneration. However, we still lack a general understanding of how intrinsic (frugivore and plant species traits) and extrinsic (landscape features) factors interact to determine how seeds of a given species {{are more likely to}} be deposited in some places more than in others. We develop a multi-species mechanistic model of seed dispersal based on frugivore behavioural responses to landscape heterogeneity. The model was fitted to data from three-years of spatially-explicit field observations on the behaviour of six frugivorous thrushes and the fruiting patterns of three fleshy-fruited trees in a secondary forest of the Cantabrian range (N Spain). With such model we explore how seed rain patterns arise from the interaction between animal behaviour and landscape heterogeneity. We show that different species of thrushes respond differently to landscape heterogeneity even though they belong to the same genus, and that provide <b>complementary</b> <b>seed</b> dispersal functions. Simulated seed rain patterns are only realistic when at least some landscape heterogeneity (forest cover and fruit abundance) is taken into account. The common and simple approach of re-sampling movement data to quantify seed dispersal produces biases in both the distance and the habitat at which seeds arrive. Movement behaviour not only affects dispersal distance and seed rain patterns but also can affect frugivore diet composition even if there is no built-i...|$|R
40|$|Aim of the study: Seed {{dispersal}} is {{a crucial}} process in tree population dynamics. In the case of yew, Taxus baccata L., seeds are dispersed by birds and mammals in a non-random, microhabitat-dependent way, a pattern constraining population renewal and expansion. While skewed dispersal has been frequently found, we lack knowledge on how consistent are spatial restrictions across time and yew’s geographical range. This sort of information {{is required for the}} development of trans-regional management tools for this species. Area of study: Three Taxus baccata stands across Spain, namely Cantabrian Range, Sierra de Gredos and Sierra de Cazorla. Material and methods: During two consecutive years, we have been studying the contribution of frugivorous animals to the seed dispersal patterns of Taxus baccata L., in three ecologically contrasted localities of the Iberian Peninsula. Main results: The spatial distribution of the seeds in the landscape was very heterogeneous, with the majority of the seeds consistently dispersed into forested microhabitats and almost none outside the forest. The main seed dispersers were always frugivorous birds, particularly thrushes (Turdus merula, T. viscivorus, T. philomelos and T. iliacus). Research highlights: The results highlighted the large-scale consistency of the seed dispersal system of Taxus baccata. We suggest that the generalized spatially-restricted dispersal contributes to the lack of regeneration and absence of population expansion of the species all over its range. As a trans-regional conservation strategy, we recommend measures aimed at maintaining as much as diverse assemblage of frugivores in order to provide <b>complementary</b> <b>seed</b> dispersal and therefore enhance population regeneration and expansion.

40|$|Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential {{heavy metal}} {{that is highly}} toxic to aquatic organisms. Daphnia pulex, a {{keystone}} species in freshwater ecosystems, {{are known for their}} quick responsiveness and ability to develop tolerance to Cd. Recent research with plants and vertebrates suggests microRNAs (miRNA), a family of short non-coding RNAs, are involved in the response and development of tolerance to heavy metals including Cd. However, no comparable studies have been carried out with invertebrates. Further, at the time this research began, only 44 miRNAs had been predicted in D. pulex and none validated. In order to reveal the role of miRNAs in D. pulex response and tolerance to Cd, I carried out a series of experiments aimed at: 1) predicting and validating D. pulex miRNAs; 2) identifying miRNAs related with short-term and multi-generational Cd acclimation; and 3) predicting gene targets and their potential role in response to Cd exposure. To achieve these goals, I first computationally predicted 75 D. pulex miRNAs, validated 8 in different developmental stages, and identified a stably expressed reference gene during D. pulex development. MiRNA expression profiles suggests miRNAs play critical roles during D. pulex development. Secondly, I used a miRNA microarray to identify Cd-responsive miRNAs under short-term (48 h) Cd exposure. A total of 29 Cd-responsive miRNAs were identified and predicted gene targets suggests these miRNAs are involved in ion transport, mitochondrial damage, DNA repair and cellular energy balance. In addition, Cd-responsive miR- 210 was shown to be hypoxia-responsive and I proposed both Cd and hypoxia induce miR- 210 via a similar HIF 1 α related-pathway. Moreover, the microarray detected 230 robustly expressed miRNAs. I used this data to predict miRNA gene targets using thermodynamics and <b>complementary</b> <b>seed</b> region methods and stored this information in a public online database (www. daphniatar. org). Finally, I exposed D. pulex to sub-lethal Cd concentrations for 25 generations to induce Cd tolerance and observed the maintenance of enhanced tolerance in a Cd-free environment for an additional three generations. Cd tolerance was related with 10 miRNAs that target genes that can switch cellular energy allocation by suppressing GTPase and cuticle protein pathways. In addition, this experiment showed enhanced Cd tolerance is related with induction of metallothioneins MT 3 and MT 4 and revealed D. pulex can switch energy allocation to growth and reproduction in Cd-free environments by down-regulating MT 1 and MT 3. In conclusion, this research provides novel information on the molecular mechanisms responsible for short-term and multi-generational Cd exposure in aquatic invertebrates. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSequence {{similarity}} {{search is}} a fundamental way of analyzing nucleotide sequences. Despite decades of research, {{this is not a}} solved problem because there exist many similarities that are not found by current methods. Search methods are typically based on a seed-and-extend approach, which has many variants (e. g. spaced seeds, transition seeds), and it remains unclear how to optimize this approach. This study designs and tests seeding methods for inter-mammal and inter-insect genome comparison. By considering substitution patterns of real genomes, we design sets of multiple <b>complementary</b> transition <b>seeds,</b> which have better performance (sensitivity per run time) than previous seeding strategies. Often the best seed patterns have more transition positions than those used previously. We also point out that recent computer memory sizes (e. g. 60 GB) make it feasible to use multiple (e. g. eight) seeds for whole mammal genomes. Interestingly, the most sensitive settings achieve diminishing returns for human-dog and melanogaster-pseudoobscura comparisons, but not for human-mouse, which suggests that we still miss many human-mouse alignments. Our optimized heuristics find ∼ 20 000 new human-mouse alignments that are missing from the standard UCSC alignments. We tabulate seed patterns and parameters that work well so they can be used in future research...|$|R

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRs) are {{regulatory}} small noncoding RNAs {{that control}} expression of target genes by inhibiting translation and directly targeting messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts for degradation [1]. The mature miR binds to its target by partial complementarity, {{usually in the}} 3 `UTR of target mRNA. Each miR has a specific <b>complementary</b> <b>seed</b> sequence, around 7 or 8 nucleotides long. By binding to the seed sequence on the mRNA, the miR can either cause the target mRNA to be destroyed, or merely inhibit subsequent translation of the mRNA [2 - 4]. A single miR can regulate multiple targets [5]. miR expression profiles {{have been used to}} classify cancers, reviewed in [6], and investigations into breast cancer expression profiles have discovered abnormally high levels of particular miRs [7 - 10]. Studies are underway to identify the mechanisms underlying the deregulation of miRs and their association with cancer [11]. In breast cancer a small number of miRs {{have been found to be}} significantly deregulated in breast cancer tissue compared with non-malignant breast tissue [7, 9, 10, 12]. Expression profiling of miRs comparing normal breast tissue and breast tumours have found that miR- 155 is upregulated in breast cancer and can act as an oncomir [9 - 11]. Since miRs operate by inhibiting the translation of their target mRNA, one could speculate that miR- 155 targets might be critical in breast tumour progression and metastasis. The aim of this work was to investigate the oncogenic role of miR- 155 in breast cancer. Chapter 1 is a literature review focussed on miR- 155 in breast cancer, including the clinical relevance of miR- 155, functional characterisation, regulation of miR- 155 and target genes of miR- 155. In the review, a comprehensive list of all confirmed miR- 155 target genes was compiled, in order to act as a resource for future researchers investigating the functional significance of miR- 155 dysregulation. The review also encompasses the origin of this miR and subsequent processing. The main aim of the literature review was to establish the field of knowledge, in order to identify areas of interest for future research: areas involving miR- 155 in breast cancer that had not been fully explored. In Chapter 2 the upregulation of miR- 155 by p 63 and mutant p 53 in breast cancer is investigated, as well as the novel downstream target of miR- 155, ZNF 652. ZNF 652 was an appealing target gene to investigate, as it was found to repress drivers of invasion and metastasis and could be a key downstream target of miR- 155 and thus be the basis for miR- 155 ’s oncogenic effects in breast cancer. The discovery that miR- 155 was upregulated by p 63 and mutant p 53 was exciting, as the regulation of miR- 155 is an area that has not previously been thoroughly researched (as revealed by the literature review in Chapter 1). The regulation of miR- 155 is a theme that is continued in Chapter 3, which investigates which p 63 isoform is responsible for the regulation of miR- 155. The scope of this work was broader and not limited to breast cancer alone, as the mechanism of miR- 155 regulation could be relevant to any of the cancer types in which miR- 155 is upregulated. The TAp 63 and ΔNp 63 isoforms have opposing effects in cancer, and understanding the mechanism of regulation of miR- 155 could aid our understanding of how miR- 155 becomes highly upregulated in invasive breast cancers. Furthermore, this understanding could be used to better diagnose or treat patients with invasive breast cancer. Finally, Chapter 4 summarises the results and implications of this research. Thesis (M. Phil.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Medicine, 201...|$|R

40|$|Intra- and {{interspecific}} spatially contagious {{seed dispersal}} has far-reaching implications for plant recruitment, distribution, and community assemblage. However, logistical and analytical limitations have curtailed our understanding concerning the mechanisms and resulting spatial patterns of contagious seed dispersal in most systems and, especially, in complex seed-disperser networks. We investigated mechanisms of seed aggregation using techniques of spatial point pattern analysis and extensive data sets on mutispecific endozoochorous seed rain generated by five frugivorous mammals in three Mediterranean shrublands over two seasons. Our novel analytical approach revealed three hierarchical and <b>complementary</b> mechanisms of <b>seed</b> aggregation acting {{at different levels}} (fecal samples, seeds, pairs of seed species) and spatial scales. First, the three local guilds of frugivores tended to deliver their feces highly aggregated at small and intermediate spatial scales, and the overall pattern of fecal delivery could be described well by a nested doublecluster Thomas process. Second, once the strong observed fecal aggregation was accounted for, the distribution of mammal feces containing seeds was clustered within the pattern of all feces (i. e., with and without seeds), and the density of fecal samples containing seeds was higher than expected around other feces containing seeds in two out of the three studied seeddisperser networks. Finally, at a finer level, mark correlation analyses revealed that for some plant species pairs, the number of dispersed seeds was positively associated either at small or large spatial scales. Despite the relatively invariant patterning of nested double-clustering, some attributes of endozoochorous seed rain (e. g., intensity, scales of aggregation) were variable among study sites due {{to changes in the}} ecological context in which seeds and their dispersers interact. Our investigation disentangles {{for the first time the}} hierarchy of synergic mechanisms of spatially contagious seed dispersal at a range of spatial scales in complex seeddisperser networks, thus providing a robust and widely applicable framework for future studies. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.
