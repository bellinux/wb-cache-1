The U. S.

The cable-bolted areas successfully maintained roof support throughout the tailgate and bleeder entries. <b>Cable</b> <b>supports</b> replaced wood cribbing as secondary support in the bleeder entry system and minimized the use of cribbing in the longwall tailgate entries.

Effects of some structural parameters such as cable sag, cross sectional area, applied mass and pre-tensions in the reverse profiled cables have been investigated. Numerical results show that for <b>cable</b> <b>supported</b> bridges with shallow sag the lowest frequencies correspond to lateral and torsional vibration modes which are always combined together and become two types of coupled modes: coupled lateral-torsional modes, as well as coupled torsional-lateral modes. The effects of structural parameters are complex and the natural frequencies can be altered by introducing different pre-tensions in the reverse profiled cables...|$|R

In this paper, the wind-induced response of an L-shaped <b>cable</b> <b>support</b> glass curtain wall is analyzed. In order to truly reflect the force transmission, a finite element model of curtain wall is established to ensure collaborative deformation between glass and cable, including glass panel, cable, sealant, and claw connection. Time-domain vibration analysis of the curtain wall is carried out with the random sequence of multinode fluctuating wind velocity time history simulated by autoregressive linear filtering method based on Kaimal wind velocity spectrum. Four wind flow directions are specified, namely, 0 °, 15 °, 30 °, and 45 °, to analyze the wind-induced dynamic response of this structure with consideration of the fluid-structure interaction effect. Finally, the deflection of the glass surface is studied by statistical analysis of displacement so as to obtain the wind vibration coefficient suitable for structural design of practical projects, and the variation of cable force is investigated as well...|$|R

Effects of important parameters such as cable sag and pre-tension are also studied.

The tension in the top <b>supporting</b> <b>cables</b> can be adjusted to a high level by the pre-tension in the reverse profiled bottom cables, with the total horizontal force in the bridge structure remaining reasonably constant. It is also evident that pre-tensioned horizontally profiled cables can greatly increase the lateral horizontal stiffness and suppress the lateral horizontal deflection induced by eccentric vertical loads...|$|R
