40|$|The {{development}} of the spirally thickened xylem element from a <b>cambium</b> <b>initial</b> of sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus has been traced by means of electron microscopy. The narrow elongated cambial initial undergoes considerable expansion in all dimensions. The cytoplasm at this stage is distributed in a thin skin between the cell wall and a large vacuole. No correlation has been observed between the distribution of any organelle and {{the pattern of the}} eventual thickenings. After the sites of thickening deposition have become apparent, the most conspicuous feature of the cell is the proliferation of Golgi bodies and vesicles. It is suggested that the material of the developing thickenings stems from direct apposition of the material in the Golgi vesicles. After glutaraldehyde fixation, microtubules (200 to 220 A in diameter) are seen to be sited in specific relation to the thickenings, the orientation of the tubules mirroring that of the fibrils seen in the thickenings. Possible reasons for absence of an observable pattern in the expanded but relatively undifferentiated cell are given, and the possible roles of the Golgi apparatus and microtubules in the thickening production are discusse...|$|E
40|$|Cambial {{variants}} {{represent a}} form of secondary growth that creates great stem anatomical diversity in lianas. Despite the importance of cambial variants, nothing {{is known about the}} developmental mechanisms that may have led to the current diversity seen in these stems. Here, a thorough anatomical analysis of all genera along the phylogeny of Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae) was carried out in order to detect when in their ontogeny and phylogeny there were shifts leading to different stem anatomical patterns. We found that all species depart from a common developmental basis, with a continuous, regularly growing <b>cambium.</b> <b>Initial</b> development is then followed by the modification of four equidistant portions of the cambium that reduce the production of xylem and increase the production of phloem, the former with much larger sieve tubes and an extended lifespan. In most species, the formerly continuous cambium becomes disjunct, with cambial portions within phloem wedges and cambial portions between them. Other anatomical modifications such as the formation of multiples of four phloem wedges, multiple-dissected phloem wedges, and included phloem wedges take place thereafter. The fact that each novel trait raised on the ontogenetic trajectory appeared in subsequently more recent ancestors on the phylogeny suggests a recapitulatory history. This recapitulation is, however, caused by the terminal addition of evolutionary novelties rather than a truly heterochronic process. Truly heterochronic processes were only found in shrubby species, which resemble juveniles of their ancestors, {{as a result of a}} decelerated phloem formation by the variant cambia. In addition, the modular evolution of phloem and xylem in Bignonieae seems to indicate that stem anatomical modifications in this group occurred at the level of cambial initials.

40|$|Wood (secondary xylem) derives froma lateral {{meristem}} called vascular cam-bium. It {{is considered}} essential for pro-duction {{and maintenance of}} trees but is equally important in hydraulic functioning of smaller growth forms. Wood includes longitudinally elongated cells (water-conducting elements and fibers) and transversally oriented cells (rays); it is characterized by radial rows of cells resulting from the periclinal divisions of <b>cambium</b> <b>initials.</b> A vascular <b>cambium</b> evolved independently in several Devonian and Carboniferous plant lin-eages [supporting online material (SOM) text]. Unlike the <b>cambium</b> <b>initials</b> of all other lineages, the <b>cambium</b> <b>initials</b> of the lignophytes (pro-gymnosperms and seed plants) frequently divide anticlinally (1), which results in circumferentia...|$|R
40|$|The {{secondary}} laticifer in {{the secondary}} phloem is differentiated from the vascular cambia of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.). The number of secondary laticifers {{is closely related to}} the rubber yield potential of Hevea. Pharmacological data show that jasmonic acid and its precursor linolenic acid are effective in inducing secondary laticifer differentiation in epicormic shoots of the rubber tree. In the present study, an experimental system of coronatine-induced laticifer differentiation was developed to perform SSH identification of genes with differential expression. A total of 528 positive clones were obtained by blue-white screening, of which 248 clones came from the forward SSH library while 280 clones came from the reverse SSH library. Approximately 215 of the 248 clones and 171 of the 280 clones contained cDNA inserts by colony PCR screening. A total of 286 of the 386 ESTs were detected to be differentially expressed by reverse northern blot and sequenced. Approximately 147 unigenes with an average length of 497 bp from the forward and 109 unigenes with an average length of 514 bp from the reverse SSH libraries were assembled and annotated. The unigenes were associated with the stress/defense response, plant hormone signal transduction and structure development. It is suggested that Ca 2 + signal transduction and redox seem to be involved in differentiation, while PGA and EIF are associated with the division of <b>cambium</b> <b>initials</b> for COR-induced secondary laticifer differentiation in the rubber tree...|$|R
40|$|Different {{concentrations}} of 6 -benzyladenine (6 -BA) {{were used in}} vitro to induce buds in three types of explants: leaf discs, root segments and the seedling itself obtained from in vitro seed germination of Passiflora cincinnata Mast. The 0. 5 mg. L - 1 6 -BA concentration was most suitable for all the three explants, however, bud formation time and means (direct/indirect) were different {{for each type of}} explant. In seedlings used as explants, it had shoot regeneration from the primary root. Histological events leading to bud formation via meristemoids were described. The origin was indirect in leaf discs, with callus formation in subepidermal cells of the chlorophyll parenchyma layers. In root segments and in seedling roots, the buds were formed directly in the pericycle (in roots with some secondary structure) and in the vascular <b>cambium</b> (at the <b>initial</b> phase of secondary structure). Also, indirect buds originated from meristemoids which were formed around the callus...|$|R
