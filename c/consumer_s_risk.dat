40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} consumers' perceived {{risks and benefits of}} agro-biotechnology in shaping purchase patterns for organic food among U. <b>S.</b> <b>consumers.</b> Perceived <b>risks</b> and benefits of biotechnology, general purchase behavior, knowledge of GM technology, and socio-demographic variables are examined in relation to their impact on organic food purchases. Consumers who are concerned about negative attributes of agro-biotechnology, including long-term health and environmental hazards, inequity in the distribution of benefits from the technology, and adverse effects to small and medium farms, are the potential organic food consumers. Growth in the organic food market is largely dependent on continued reinforcement of consumers' belief that organic foods are safer than conventional foods.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an alternative theory of price adjustment resting on consumer loss aversion {{in the price}} dimension. In line with prospect theory the perceived losses from price increases are weighted stronger in the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> utility function than the perceived gains resulting from price decreases of equal magnitude. Prices are evaluated relative to a certain reference price which is endogenous, sluggish and depends to the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> recent rational price expectations. Two key modeling implications arise: First, demand responses are more elastic for price increases than for price decreases and thus firms face a downward-sloping demand curve that is kinked at the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> reference price. Second, changes in the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> recent rational price expectations and hence in the <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> reference price can alter demand through {{what we call the}} reference-price-updating effect. We incorporate this into an otherwise standard dynamic neoclassical model of monopolistic competition and analyze price and quantity reactions to various demand shocks. We find that although firms may change their prices flexibly, {{depending on the size of}} the shock the prices adjust more or less pronounced than in the standard monopoly model and that prices can even be rigid. Additionally, we find that the price adjustment is asymmetric with respect to shock size and sign and the current state of the business cycle, i. e. pricing is state-dependent...|$|R

40|$|As food quality {{becomes more}} complex, <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> are tending {{to reduce their}} {{involvement}} in the food purchase decision- making process. Consequently, prices are becoming more significant as they represent an easy choice criterion when <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> have less information {{about the differences between}} the product and process quality inherent in food items (including environmental or social issues). The organic food sector provides high, complex food quality profiles and has therefore been seriously affected by this development.

40|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} {{whether the}} implementation of traceability systems can contribute towards restoring consumer confidence in food quality and safety, {{one of the goals}} of the European Food Law. To date, little is known about how consumers perceive the role and potential impact of traceability within the supply chain. This paper aims to provide insight into how traceability information can offer guarantees of food quality and safety, and contribute towards increased consumer confidence. Data, collected in four EU countries, examines salient cognitions and attitudes that underpin consumer beliefs about product traceability that will influence their decision making. It will link traceability- related food attributes to perceived benefits (in terms of quality and safety) and important consumer values. Furthermore, variations between different <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> are examined to illustrate how the concepts of food safety and food quality may have different meanings and consequences in the various European countries. Understanding which benefits <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> associate with traceability will assist in providing consumers with traceability information in line with their requirement <b>s.</b> Traceability, <b>Consumer</b> Perception, Food Safety, Food Quality, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R

40|$|Recently, Italian {{agriculture}} {{has been}} widely characterised by {{the increasing number of}} farms and land converting to organic farming. In the slow process of shifting from a "niche" to a broader consumption in the organic products market deep differences between conventional and organic production, distribution and consumption became evident. In such a context, the consumer's behaviour about organic products analysis transpires to be complex as it involves either social - economic and psychographic characteristics. In order to address this issue a research has been carried out in two steps: in the first one, a qualitative analysis step, 45 <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> of organic products were interviewed by phone using laddering techniques; then, in the second quantitative step, data from a 203 <b>consumer</b> <b>s</b> sample, representative of a region of South of Italy, was analysed by means of a multinomial logit.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} incentive contracting for registered investment company advisors and the performance {{and the risk of}} the portfolio managed by the advisor. To test these relationships, four measures of return and three measures of risk are employed in a pooled time-series, cross-sectional regression. ^ The results {{of this study indicate that}} managerial incentive fees do not significantly correlate with the overall performance of the managed fund.

However, the empirical results did show a positive relationship between the presence of a performance-based fee and a fund 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>risk</b> adjusted return. ^ The results confirm that incentive contracting does impact portfolio management risk-taking.
