50|$|A {{voidable}} {{marriage is}} a marriage which can be <b>canceled</b> at the <b>option</b> {{of one of the}} parties. It is a valid marriage, but is subject to cancellation if contested in court by one of the parties to the marriage. The validity of a voidable marriage can only be made by one of the parties to the marriage; thus, a voidable marriage cannot be annulled after the death of one of the parties. A marriage can be voidable for a variety of reasons, depending on jurisdiction. Forced/coerced marriages are usually voidable. In countries where marriage law is influenced by religion (especially Roman Catholicism) there can be numerous reasons for a marriage to be voidable (see section below).|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two chapters. Chapter 1 examines the ex-ante optimality of repricing and rescission of executive stock options while considering dilution effects and the tax effects of new accounting rules associated with repricing and rescission. Traditional repricing lowers the exercise price of outstanding options to match the declined {{market value of the}} stock. Rescission allows employees to <b>cancel</b> already-exercised <b>options</b> when share prices fall, which was not an issue until 2000 when the stock market plummeted. To my best knowledge, this study is the first research on examining the possible optimality of traditional repricing and rescission while considering the economic impact of changing accounting rules in an ex-ante contracting setting. Chapter 2 examines the ex-ante optimality of repricing alternatives and derives an optimal repricing-triggered policy, which specify how deeply the options are under water before repricing takes place. In practice, traditional repricing practices have become obsolete since new accounting rules took effect in July 2000. To avoid associated variable accounting charges that cause uncertainty in future reported earnings, companies have tried several repricing alternatives as solutions to rescuing underwater options. This study not only justifies the occurrence of some repricing alternatives but also quantifies the impact of the marking-to-market feature imbedded in the new accounting rules...|$|R

40|$|Game {{options are}} American-type options with the {{additional}} property that the seller of the option has the right the <b>cancel</b> the <b>option</b> at any time prior to the buyer exercise or the expiration date of the option. The cancelation by the seller can be achieved through a payment of an additional penalty to the exercise payoff or using a payoff process {{greater than or equal}} to the exercise value. The main contribution of this thesis is a numerical framework for computing the value of such options with finite maturity time as well as in the perpetual setting. This framework employs the theory of weak solutions of parabolic and elliptic variational inequalities. These solutions will be computed using finite element methods. The computational advantage of this framework is that it allows the user to go from one type of process to another by changing the stiffness matrix in the algorithm. Several types of Levy processes will be used to show the functionality of this method. The processes considered are of pure diffusion type (Black-Scholes model), the CGMY process as a pure jump model and a combination of the two for the case of jump diffusion. Computational results of the option prices as well as exercise, hold and cancelation regions are shown together with numerical estimates of the error convergence rates with respect to the L 2 norm and the energy norm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Leasing {{industry}} {{is one of}} the flourishing sector of Bangladesh. The leasing companies on the average are doing pretty well since inception in this country. Leasing has gained its popularity for several reasons. The first and most important of all is that leasing {{can be thought of as}} an alternative source of fund which is most of the cases cheaper, and for the companies which don’t have a high credit rating or a visible positive past track record, this may be the main source of financing. Another thing is, lease is an alternative to investment. If you need a particular asset for running or expanding your business, you may choose to lease it rather than purchase it. And you can <b>cancel</b> the lease <b>options</b> in the face of changing macroeconomic factors, such as obsolescence, new technologies, changing business needs or market conditions etc. Lease is nowadays treated by the developed markets as a provider of 100 % financing and they have a notion that lease displaces debt. Leasing actually reduces the leverage needs of a firm. We can understand that the leasing market is still very small in Bangladesh and the actual potential market is highly untapped. Since people are not well aware of different types of lease products, they look for other alternative before leasing. But now it’s time for us to break away from tradition and utilize leasing in our businesses fully so that we can realize its benefits. We believe that leasing sector in Bangladesh wil...|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its C Squadron for flight deck trials aboard Eagle. Two sets of trials were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of trials involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ships jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.Ark Royal had entered refit to accommodate the Phantom in 1967; this involved a major reconstruction, including several elements to allow the ship to operate the aircraft - the flight deck was increased in area and fully angled to 8½°, the arresting gear was replaced with a new water-spray system to accommodate the Phantoms higher weight and landing speed, and bridle catchers and water-cooled JBDs were fitted to the catapults.
