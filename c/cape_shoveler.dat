40|$|The {{ability to}} {{disperse}} over long distances {{can result in}} a high propensity for colonizing new geographic regions and lead to lineage diversification via allopatric speciation. However, high vagility can also result in gene flow between otherwise allopatric populations, and in some cases, parapatric or divergence-with-gene-flow models of speciation might be more applicable to widely distributed lineages. Here, I used five nuclear introns and the mitochondrial control region to examine divergence, gene flow, and phylogenetic relationships within a cosmopolitan lineage comprising six species, the blue-winged ducks (genus Anas), which inhabit all continents except Antarctica. I found two primary sub-lineages, the globally-distributed shoveler group and the New World blue-winged/cinnamon teal group. The blue-winged/cinnamon sub-lineage is composed of sister taxa from North America and South America that are characterized by parapatric distributions and low to moderate levels of gene flow. In contrast, my data support strict allopatry for most pairwise comparisons within the shovelers. However, I found evidence of gene flow from the migratory Holarctic northern shoveler (A. clypeata) and the more sedentary African <b>Cape</b> <b>shoveler</b> (A. smithii) into the Australasian shoveler (A. rhynchotis), supporting my hypothesis of intercontinental gene flow. Given the diverse mechanisms of speciation within this complex, the shovelers and blue-winged/cinnamon teals can serve as an effective model system for examining how the genome diverges under different evolutionary processes and how genetic variation is partitioned among highly dispersive taxa...|$|E

This tribe includes all of the 2 ̆ 2 puddle ducks 2 ̆ 2 that constitute most of the important game species throughout the world. Of the 39 species making up the tribe, all but 3 can readily {{be placed in the}} single genus Anas. The tribe has a worldwide distribution, with some of the species occurring on several continents and having extensive transcontinental migration patterns. However, most of the species are temperate-breeding forms and are generally adapted to shallow, marshy habitats where food can be obtained from near the surface by dabbling or tipping-up. In most species the males have fairly elaborate and colorful breeding plumages, whereas the ground-nesting females are mostly cryptically patterned with buff and brown. In nearly all species both sexes have iridescent wing speculum markings, and in all species the trachea has an enlarged bulla at the syrinx. Pair bonds are generally reformed each year during the nonbreeding season, but in some species with long breeding seasons the pair bonds are relatively permanent and the males remain with their offspring and help to protect them...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Despite the {{importance}} of movement ecology studies, the field faces a prevailing challenge of methodological limitations in tracking individual organisms. This research investigated {{the utility of the}} stable isotope technique to trace movements of ducks in southern Africa. I sampled and analysed feathers of ten duck species for stable isotope proportions of Carbon (δ 13 C), Nitrogen (δ 15 N) and Hydrogen (δD), from five wetlands (Strandfontein and Barberspan in South Africa, the Manyame catchment in Zimbabwe, Lake Chuali in Mozambique, and Lake Ngami in Botswana) as test cases. Sampling was carried out at different seasons to account for seasonal isotope signature variations. Isotope signatures of feathers grown at different moulting locations were compared to test whether southern Africa shows stable isotope spatial patterns (distinct isotopic regions). Feathers grown at different life-phases were compared to test whether different sites had been used and if more mobile species showed more and stronger isotope distinctions. Finally, growing flight feathers grown at moulting locations were compared across species to query how much information on diet and foraging behaviour can be inferred from southern African duck feather stable isotopes. Feather isotope signatures were distinct by site in {{at least one of the}} tested isotopes, for the majority of ducks tested. Strandfontein had more and stronger distinctions of isotope signatures between feathers grown at different life phases. This site is the closest to the sea and most likely to have marine-influenced isotope signatures especially in δ 15 N, it falls within the Mediterranean climatic conditions experiencing winter rainfall unlike all the other sites. Vegetation compositions (C 3 and C 4 plant distributions) therefore vary across sites influencing δ 13 C patterns. More mobile species (only Egyptian Goose Alopochen aegyptiacus from Strandfontein, and <b>Cape</b> <b>Shoveler</b> Anas smithii from Barberspan; determined by mobility scores from other studies) had more and stronger distinctions between flight and body feathers. All the other species did not comply with mobility scores. They showed weaker and fewer tissue signature distinctions than their mobility scores suggested. There were high isotopic signature overlaps in δ 13 C and δ 15 N across and within feeding guilds at each moulting site implying dietary overlaps during moulting. More overlaps occurred during the dry seasons (summer in Strandfontein and winter in Lake Chuali, Manyame catchment site, and Lake Ngami). Higher isotopic variances (higher dietary flexibility) were associated with isotope signature divergence to mobility scores especially in Cape Teals and Yellow-billed Ducks. The isotope technique is flawed with uncontrollable sources of variation which potentially confound movement inferences. It is best used when accompanied by conventional methods to detect and counter against species specific biology and dietary behaviour imposed biases in tissue isotope signatures. Further research on how species specific biological processes affect the reflection of spatial patterns of isotopes in feathers is recommended. Multi-isotope time explicit approaches and trace element analysis were also recommended. Scientists should be wary about basing management strategies or building theory about movement patterns of species based on the technique at least in stochastic environments such as southern Africa. My results provide empirical evidence that the technique is unreliable at this scale of analysis. In particular, the majority of ducks in this region are not good candidates for use of isotopic signatures in distinguishing movement patterns of southern African ducks. 498...|$|E
