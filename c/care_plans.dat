5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the end of}} the legislative session, Beshear called for a special legislative session to consider a way to meet the state's Medicaid obligations and whether or not to raise the minimum dropout age. In the special session, legislators also approved raising the minimum dropout age to 18 during the special session. Following the session, the National Education Association honored Beshear with its America's Greatest Education Governor Award for 2011, citing his advocacy for raising the minimum dropout age and his consistent refusal to cut education funding. Both houses also approved a plan that allowed Beshear to move the funds from the second year of the budget, but triggered automatic spending cuts if the managed <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> did not generate sufficient savings. The bill also called for the hiring of an independent accounting firm to assess the savings achieved by the managed <b>care</b> <b>plans.</b> Beshear then used his line-item veto to strike the spending cuts and the savings assessment provisions, per a previous arrangement with Democratic lawmakers. By eliminating these provisions, the version of the bill signed by Beshear was essentially the plan he had proposed during the regular session. The House adjourned the session March 24, but the Senate remained in session until April 6, voting to override Beshear's vetoes, but without concurrence from the House, the override votes were ineffective.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Pittston {{still felt}} {{the strain of}} {{providing}} benefits, with the cost per miner increasing by $3,746 from the 1979 amount. The company was still going into debt and having a difficult time paying for the miners' benefits. To avoid losing more money, Pittston doubled health deductibles, lowered the coverage from 100% to 80%, and discontinued benefits to miners who retired before 1974. This change {{in the health care}} plan was still not enough for the company to gain a profit, so they decided to keep the mines running 24hours a day and seven days a week, with no overtime for the workers. Pittston also did away with successorship clauses, which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} {{and impact of}} long term conditions continues to rise. <b>Care</b> <b>planning</b> for people with long term conditions has been a policy priority in England for chronic disease management. However, {{it is not clear}} how <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> is currently understood, translated and implemented in primary care. This study explores experience of <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> in patients with long term conditions in three areas in England. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 predominantly elderly patients with multiple long term conditions. The interviews were designed to explore variations in and emergent experiences of <b>care</b> <b>planning.</b> Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts involved reflexively coding and re-coding data into categories and themes. Results No participants reported experiencing explicit <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> discussions or receiving written documentation setting out a negotiated <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> and they were unfamiliar with the term ‘care planning’. However, most described some components of <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> which occurred over a number of contacts with health care professionals which we term”reactive” <b>care</b> <b>planning.</b> Here, key elements of <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> including goal setting and action planning were rare. Additionally, poor continuity and coordination of care, lack of time in consultations, and patient concerns about what was legitimate to discuss with the doctor were described. Conclusions Amongst this population, elements of <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> were present in their accounts, but a structured, comprehensive process and consequent written record (as outlined in English Department of Health policy) was not evident.

25|$|Managed <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> {{are widely}} {{credited}} with subduing medical cost inflation {{in the late}} 1980s by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations, forcing providers to discount their rates, and causing {{the health care industry}} to become more efficient and competitive. Managed <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> and strategies proliferated and quickly became nearly ubiquitous in the U.S. However, this rapid growth led to a consumer backlash. Because many managed care health plans are provided by for-profit companies, their cost-control efforts created widespread perception that they were more interested in saving money than providing health care. In a 2004 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a majority of those polled said they believed that managed care decreased the time doctors spend with patients, made it harder for people who are sick to see specialists, and had failed to produce significant health care savings. These public perceptions have been fairly consistent in polling since 1997.|$|E

40|$|Background: Advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> {{comprises}} {{discussions about}} an individual’s wishes for future care {{while they have}} capacity. Aim: To explore professionals’ experiences on the implementation of advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> in two areas of clinical care, dementia and palliative care. Design: Qualitative study, focus groups and individual interviews. Setting: North East of England. Sample: Ninety-five participants from one Primary Care Trust, two acute National Health Service Hospital Trusts, one Ambulance Trust, one Local Authority and voluntary organisations and the legal sector. Results: Fourteen focus groups and 18 interviews were held with 95 participants. While professionals agreed that advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> {{was a good idea}} in theory, implementation in practice presented them with significant challenges. The majority expressed uncertainty over the general value of advance <b>care</b> <b>planning,</b> whether current service provision could meet patient wishes, their individual roles and responsibilities and which aspects of advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> were legally binding; the array of different advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> forms and documentation available added to the confusion. In dementia care, the timing of when to initiate advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> discussions was an added challenge. Conclusions: This study has identified the professional, organisational and legal factors that influence advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> implementation; professional training should target these specific areas. There is an urgent need for standardisation of advance <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> documentation. Greater clarity is also required on the roles and responsibilities of different professional groups.

40|$|Background: Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> is an {{iterative}} process of discussion, decision-making and documentation about end-of-life <b>care.</b> Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> is highly relevant in palliative care due to intersecting clinical needs. To enhance {{the implementation of}} Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning,</b> the contextual factors influencing its uptake need to be better understood. Aim: To identify the contextual factors influencing the uptake of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> in palliative <b>care</b> as published between January 2008 and December 2012. Methods: Databases were systematically searched for studies about Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> in palliative <b>care</b> published between January 2008 and December 2012. This yielded 27 eligible studies, which were appraised using National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Quality Appraisal Checklists. Iterative thematic synthesis was used to group results. Results: Factors associated with greater uptake included older age, a college degree, a diagnosis of cancer, greater functional impairment, being white, greater understanding of poor prognosis and receiving or working in specialist palliative care. Barriers included having non-malignant diagnoses, having dependent children, being African American, and uncertainty about Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> and its legal status. Individuals’ previous illness experiences, preferences and attitudes also influenced their participation. Conclusion: Factors influencing the uptake of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> in palliative <b>care</b> are complex and multifaceted reflecting the diverse and often competing needs of patients, health professionals, legislature and health systems.

40|$|Aims and objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the phenomenon of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> and the use of Advance Care Directives in residential aged care facilities in Australia. The objectives were to: i) investigate the implementation process of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> and the use of Advance Care Directives; ii) investigate the outcomes of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> and experiences of people involved in Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> and Advance <b>Care</b> Directives, including residents, families and nursing staff. Background. Benefits of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> for older residents are considerable given their degenerative health-breakdown and minimal chance of recovery. To date, the use of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> and Advance <b>Care</b> Directives is limited and models of service delivery and processes are needed to enhance best practice with Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> and positive outcomes for older Australians. Design: Case study. Methods: The study conducted using multiple sources of evidence to enrich understanding of the phenomenon of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning.</b> The researcher engaged in data collection over six months involving participant observation, field notes, semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The findings contribute to the limited knowledge of options currently available to older adults and their families in their decision-making about end-of-life care options. Permission to conduct the study: Prior to commencement of the data collection, ethics clearances from the University of Newcastle and the regional Area Health Service were achieved. Permission to access the residential aged care facilities to undertake the study was obtained from the relevant residential aged care facility ethics committees or designated authorities. The researcher undertook several strategies to ensure all the ethical principles were considered and adhered to while conducting the project. Results: The research identified the components and factors involved in the Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> process and in attaining desired outcomes. The conceptual framework developed elaborates how Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> should be implemented and what may constitute successful implementation of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> in residential aged care facilities. The four main elements (input, throughput, output, feedback), and 20 sub-elements were requisites for nurses to initiate and implement the Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning.</b> Conclusion: The essential components for end-of-life care are identified in the implementation processes of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> in residential aged care facilities. The study contributes to greater awareness of the processes needed for ‘dying well’ and highlights the need to explore experiences of ‘successful dying’ and the way nurses contribute to these events. Relevance to clinical practice: The case study identified four determinative requisites for successful implementation of Advance <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> in aged <b>care</b> facilities: the expert nurse, discussion, education and involvement of a multidisciplinary team.

Method:  Qualified registered nurses’ attitudes towards, understanding and knowledge of nursing theories, models and <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> in two regions of Scotland were explored. Data were collected through a questionnaire. Findings:  The data suggest that there are five factor analysis themes (Enabling Theory; Caring Practice; Negative Doing; the Encompassing Nature of Nursing and Apprenticeship) concerning with nursing theories, models and <b>care</b> <b>planning.</b> These had some similarities and some differences with Benner and Wrubel’s (1987) and Glen’s (1998) ideas about these areas of nursing. There was a significant level of dissatisfaction with the education around <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> with more than half the respondents indicating that they had received no such training. The qualitative findings provided a more detailed picture of the quantitative results and showed that there are five groups of nurses where caring practice is involved. There was also uncertainty and confusion about whether or not nursing is an art or a science and a lack of knowledge about the issues surrounding models, theories and <b>care</b> <b>planning.</b> There is a negative attitude to <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> that specifically relates to the doing of <b>care</b> <b>planning.</b> Conclusions:  There is a need to encourage the development of education about nursing theories, models and <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> for all nurses in all clinical areas because, despite the lack of credible evidence for them, there is an expectation by senior nurses that they should be used in practice.
