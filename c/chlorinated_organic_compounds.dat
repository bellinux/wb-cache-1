The study area is located in the Durham subbasin of the Deep River Triassic Basin and is underlain by interbedded siltstone and sandstone sequences. Groundwater underlying portions of the site has been impacted by historical industrial activities conducted by previous owners; groundwater contaminants consist mainly of <b>chlorinated</b> volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Bimetallic nanoscale particles (BNP) consists of nanoscale particles of zero-valent iron (Fe 0) with a trace coating of palladium.

5000|$|Industrial {{bleaching}} agents {{can also be}} sources of concern. For example, the use of elemental chlorine in the bleaching of wood pulp produces organochlorines and persistent organic pollutants, including dioxins.

However, respiratory risk from chlorine and highly toxic chlorinated byproducts still exists. A recent European study indicated that sodium hypochlorite and organic chemicals (e.g., surfactants, fragrances) contained in several household cleaning products can react to generate <b>chlorinated</b> volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> (VOCs).
