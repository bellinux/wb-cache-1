50|$|Latency in live {{performance}} occurs naturally {{from the time}} it takes sound to transmit through air. It takes sound about 3 milliseconds to travel 1 meter. Small amounts of latency occur between performers depending on how they are spaced from each other and from stage monitors if these are used. This creates a practical limit to how far apart the artists in a group can be from one another. Stage monitoring extends that limit, as sound travels close to the speed of light through the cables that <b>connect</b> <b>stage</b> monitors.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a camera-based system for detection, tracking, and {{classification}} of U. S. speed signs is presented. The implemented application uses multiple <b>connected</b> <b>stages</b> and iteratively reduces {{the number of}} pixels to process for recognition. Possible sign locations are detected using a fast, shape-based interest operator. Remaining objects other than speed signs are discarded using a classifier similar to the Viola-Jones detector. Classification results from tracked candidates are utilized to improve recognition accuracy. On a standard PC the system reached a detection speed of 27 fps with an accuracy of 98. 8 %. Including classification, speed sign recognition rates of 96. 3 % were achieved with a frame rate of approximately 11 fps and one false alarm every 42 s. I...|$|R

2500|$|As with Unix {{pipelines}}, PowerShell pipelines can construct complex commands, {{using the}} | operator to <b>connect</b> <b>stages.</b> However, the PowerShell pipeline differs from Unix pipelines in that stages execute within the PowerShell runtime {{rather than as}} a set of processes coordinated by the operating system, and structured [...]NET objects, rather than byte streams, are passed from one stage to the next. Using objects and executing stages within the PowerShell runtime eliminates the need to serialize data structures, or to extract them by explicitly parsing text output. An object can also encapsulate certain functions that work on the contained data, which become available to the recipient command for use. For the last cmdlet in a pipeline, PowerShell automatically pipes its output object to the Out-Default cmdlet, which transforms the objects into a stream of format objects and then renders those to the screen.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a new {{adaptive}} {{equalization scheme}} for time-varying and frequency selective channels in direct sequence code {{division multiple access}} (DS-CDMA) systems is proposed. It consists of a number of serially <b>connected</b> <b>stages</b> and detects users in an ordered manner, applying a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) at each stage. V-BLAST detection ordering is implemented, that is, the stronger signal is extracted rst so that the weaker users can be more easily detected. Both the equalizer lters and the order in which the users are extracted are updated in a recursive least squares (RLS) manner, efciently realized through time- and order-update recursions. Two variants of this equalization scheme are considered, with and without knowledge of the spreading sequences. Their bit error rate (BER) performance is evaluated via simulations, in a severe near-far environment, and their superiority over existing techniques is demonstrated. I...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid agent {{architectures}} {{comprise the}} radical change of paradigms in AI {{over the past}} decades by reconciling the different styles of reactive, deliberative, even social systems. They have been successfully applied {{to a range of}} complex realworld domains. Due to their originally informal background, a verification of design goals in derived implementations, theoretical foundations, and a detailed comparison with other agent models have not yet been obvious. The present work proposes a formal methodology {{to bridge the gap between}} theoretical and practical aspects especially of hybrid designs, such as the layered InteRRaP. The employed, <b>connected</b> <b>stages</b> of specification, i. e., architecture, computational model, theory, proof calculus, and implementation, also provide a yet unique framework for comparing heterogeneous agent models including unified and logic-based ones. Based on recent work on InteRRaP, we demonstrate that this methodology allows to compare state-of-the-art designs from rob [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the steady-state characteristics of pulse-link DC-AC converters applying input current-ripple reduction methods in fuel cell applications. In {{that kind of}} applications, small input current-ripple is essential. This limitation {{is caused by the}} fuel-cell chemical reaction time. Excessive and pulsed current drawn from the fuel-cell may result in less life-time or damage. In order to reduce the input current-ripple, conventional DC-AC converters for fuel-cell applications normally have large smoothing capacitor placed between boost converter stage and PWM converter stage. However, this capacitor consumes additional space, weight, and cost. A novel topology called pulse-link DC-AC converter is proposed in order to solve the abovementioned issue. This new topology does not require large capacitor value to minimize the input current-ripple. Instead, it uses series-LC circuit placed in parallel between two <b>connected</b> <b>stages.</b> The mechanism of current-ripple reduction is presented. Experimental results showing input current ripple as small as 0. 3 A with only small inductance and capacitance value is also demonstrated...|$|R

The result is swarm based active system that operates on functional level of urban development. The created platform however doesn’t operate on level of physical volume, but contained all information needed for developing final master plan for new area. The system is based on general rules, and can be theoretically used for any city extension. The research into wind systems tries to cover unexplored territories in building integrated wind energy systems, and implements new parametric tools from urban phase. The final design is yet a unique solution to this problem that operate between realms of computation design, engineering and sustainable design.
