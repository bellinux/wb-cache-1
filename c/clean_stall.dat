40|$|Background: Manure {{often results}} in {{problems}} in the society. This waste, {{in addition to having}} odor, also results in disease. However, if this waste is managed well and correctly, many benefits will be obtained. Objective: This research aimed to study the economic benefit of cow manure utilization as a renewable energy source. Result: The people of Balong Wetan were generally farmers and cow breeder. This condition was really suitable because they live in the mountain slope. However, they had not utilized their cow manure waste. They disposed cow manure around their stall. Consequently, less good smell resulted. This condition made Widodo aware of beginning to construct digester and biogas reactor to utilize the cow manure waste. According to Widodo, if this manure problem was not coped with, it would have resulted in disease. Widodo’s attempt, in fact, yielded positive result. Cow manure waste could be converted into biogas that could be used as energy source. In addition, cow manure waste that had been degassed could be used as organic fertilizer with quality equal to the chemical fertilizer’s quality. Moreover, the always-cleaned cow stall could produce quality cow milk. This Widodo’s success could open Balong Wetan people’s insight. Balong Wetan people gradually began to imitate constructing digester and biogas reactor surrounding their house. This digester and biogas reactor construction was helped by local government recalling that Balong Wetan people were largely at low economic level. Conclusion: Cow manure waste utilized as energy source affected positively the people’s economy. People could produce their own biogas that could be used as fuel in their household and could produce organic production from cow manure waste. Thus, people no longer needed to buy fuel or fertilizer, so that the money usually spent on those needs could be saved or spent on other needs. Another economic effect was that people could sell cow milk at higher price because the quality was better due to the daily <b>cleaned</b> <b>stall.</b> In addition, the people’s creativity emerged to open business by processing the cow manure waste.

40|$|Objectives: Housing and {{management}} conditions {{are expected to}} affect dairy cattle welfare. The animals could experience pain or distress {{as a result of}} widely accepted management practices, and possibly suffer being kept under apparently “unnatural” conditions. The animal welfare assessment requires the use of multiple indicators in order to analyse the heterogeneity of aspects involved. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare animal welfare of dairy cows reared in tie-stall and open-stall system by means of metabolic, immunological and stress related parameters. Materials and Methods: The study involved 80 pluriparous lactating cows belonging eight dairy farms located in the area of Mugello (Florence district) reared in different system: tye-stall (TS) and open-stall (OS). Ten blood samples were collected in the morning from the jugular vein using vacutainer tubes containing EDTA to estimate non esterified fatty acids (NEFA), total proteins (TP), creatinine (Creat), nitrogen ureic (BUN), betahidroxibutirrate (BHBA), aspartate-aminotransferase (AST) alanina-aminotransferase (ALT), calcium (Ca), chloride (Cl), potassium (K), oxygen free radicals (OFR), haptoglobin (HP), serum lisozyme (SL), bactericidal activity (SBA) and hair cortisol. Hair samples were carefully cut from the tail switch using clippers and were frozen at the temperature of - 20 °C; cortisol was analysed by the method described by Accorsi et al. At the same time body condition score (BCS) was recorded. The experiment was performed in accordance with European Commission regulations (86 / 609 /EEC) and Italian law (116 / 92). Results: Results showed that the housing system affected some parameters such as ALT, AST, N ureic, BHBA, OFR and cortisol. Most of these showed mean values within the range of reference without revealing signs of suffering. An interesting outcome regarded OFR level that resulted higher in the OS system likely as consequence of a higher productive effort. Results regarding hair cortisol were particularly interesting because it is known as an indicator of chronic stress: TSdisplayed significant (P< 0. 001) higher mean value than OS (2. 8 ± 1. 43 vs 1. 6 ± 1. 05 pg/mg respectively). The two housing systems did not differ for BCS, that was 3. 1 and 3. 0 respectively for both the solution. Conclusions: In this study did not emerge a situation of evident suffering in animals reared in TS. Tethered cows may have an improved welfare quality if they benefit from comfortable and <b>clean</b> <b>stalls,</b> quantitatively and qualitatively adequate feeding and watering, access to exercise and not in the least a good relationship with the stockperson...|$|R

He was under age, he was too delicate; he had no special recommendations. He later attempted to join the Carthusians and Cistercians, but each order rejected him as unsuitable for communal life. He was, for about six weeks, a postulant with the Carthusians at Neuville. In November 1769 he obtained admission to the Cistercian Abbey of Sept-Fonts. After a short stay at Sept-Fonts his health gave way, and it was decided that his vocation lay elsewhere.|$|R

[...] She learned that, [...] "My upbringing on the farm taught me the value of hard work, as well as how to love and care for animals. Living on Oneida Lake gave me an appreciation for our bodies of waters and showed me the importance of water conservation and keeping our water clean.

On the third day, the stranger sends the prince to <b>clean</b> the horse's <b>stall</b> and to scythe enough grass for the horse to eat. The prince is satisfied with this easy task. The maiden, who knows the enormous appetite of the horse, whispers a suggestion that he weave a strong rope from the grass.

At first, he protested: [...] "You appoint such a great ascetic to such a humiliating obedience", but then he agreed and all brethren started to pray about him. Alexander worked all day long and did not have time for his previous intensive prayer feats. Several years later Archimandrite Kronid met Alexander who was already tonsured a monk as Athanasius and, for his humble and good monastic life, was made hierodeacon. When asked whether he remembered what had happened to him, he replied: [...] "I remember everything, but only now realize the full horror of my state of mind." ...|$|R

50|$|Eric Guerin {{was born}} in Maringouin, Louisiana, in Cajun {{backwater}} country, twenty-four miles west of Baton Rouge. The son of an impoverished Cajun blacksmith, older cousin Norman Leblanc had become a jockey then a horse trainer and in 1938 the fourteen-year-old Guerin quit school {{to go to work}} for his cousin at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans. For two years, the teenager <b>cleaned</b> out horse <b>stalls</b> and began learning to ride by exercising horses. He then signed a contract to work for a Texas businessman's stable, a job that afforded him the opportunity to travel to racetracks around the country. Before long, his contract was sold to another stable owner, a common practise at the time, and Guerin {{began his career as a}} thoroughbred horse racing jockey in 1941 at the age of sixteen at Narragansett Park near Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Riding for a top stable proved to be Guerin's big break as a year later he was the United States' leading apprentice jockey. Within a few years, Eric Guerin was a highly regarded jockey on the East Coast racing circuit and in 1944 was involved in a racing rarity when he was part of a triple dead heat for first place in the Carter Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack.|$|R
