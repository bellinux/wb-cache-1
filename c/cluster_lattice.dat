DFT has been used more recently to study a wide variety of properties of metal clusters.

40|$|In the heart, {{electrical}} stimulation of cardiac myocytes increases the open probability of sarcolemmal voltage-sensitive Ca 2 + channels and flux of Ca 2 + into the cells. This increases Ca 2 + binding to ligand-gated channels known as ryanodine receptors (RyR 2). Their openings cause cell-wide release of Ca 2 +, {{which in turn}} causes muscle contraction and the generation of the mechanical force required to pump blood. In resting myocytes, RyR 2 s can also open spontaneously giving rise to spatially-confined Ca 2 + release events known as "sparks. " RyR 2 s are organized in a lattice to form clusters in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. Our recent work {{has shown that the}} spatial arrangement of RyR 2 s within clusters strongly influences the frequency of Ca 2 + sparks. We showed that the probability of a Ca 2 + spark occurring when a single RyR 2 in the cluster opens spontaneously can be predicted from the precise spatial arrangements of the RyR 2 s. Thus, "function" follows from "structure. " This probability is related to the maximum eigenvalue (λ 1) of the adjacency matrix of the RyR 2 <b>cluster</b> <b>lattice.</b> In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for understanding this relationship. We present a stochastic contact network model of the Ca 2 + spark initiation process. We show that λ 1 determines a stability threshold for the formation of Ca 2 + sparks in terms of the RyR 2 gating transition rates. We recapitulate these results by applying the model to realistic RyR 2 cluster structures informed by super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy. Eigendecomposition of the linearized mean-field contact network model reveals functional subdomains within RyR 2 clusters with distinct sensitivities to Ca 2 +. This work provides novel perspectives on the cardiac Ca 2 + release process and a general method for inferring the functional properties of transmembrane receptor clusters from their structure...|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this Thesis is the x-ray spectroscopic studies of free nano-clusters with size more than 10 ^ 3 atoms. The {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy experiments on rare gas and metal clusters were performed at beamline I 411 at MAX-lab National Swedish synchrotron radiation facility. Free rare-gas clusters are simplest objects in cluster research. However their electronic structure springs {{a lot of}} surprises. In the x-ray absorption spectra of free Kr clusters {{the positions of the}} related cluster and atomic states of the higher 3 d^{- 1 } 6 p and 3 d^{- 1 } 7 p excited states in bulk and surface atoms are reversed compared to the 3 d^{- 1 } 5 p state. The energy shifts of the higher core-excited states in cluster atoms grow towards the limiting values of the core-ionized states. The knowledge of the final cluster states reached after Auger decay of the resonantly excited core states threw a new light on this phenomenon. We explain these experimental findings by a spatial spread of the excited orbitals over the <b>cluster</b> <b>lattice.</b> The interplay of the two main effects - confinement and polarization - leads to qualitatively different situations. When the excited orbital radius is less than the interatomic distance in clusters (3 d^{- 1 } 5 p state in Kr), confinement dominates. If the excited orbital radius exceeds the nearest neighbour distance (3 d^{- 1 }np, n> 5 states in Kr), polarization takes over and the energy-level structure becomes ion-like. Interest in studies of more complex than rare gas clusters systems determined the construction of the gas-aggregation metal cluster source. For the vaporisation of low melting point metals (Na) an oven was used. Vapours of higher melting point metals (Ag, Cu, Pb) were produced with a magnetron sputtering source. The design of the gas-aggregation source and description of the experimental setup are presented in this Thesis. Using this source we performed the first core-level photoemission (XPS) experiments on free metal clusters. The recorded spectra have shown that synchrotron-based x-ray core-level photoelectron spectroscopy can be efficiently implemented to free metal clusters. The evolution of the electronic structure with size has been studied by valence ionization, XPS and Auger techniques. These measurements have shown a close similarity between large clusters and solids. The difference between the established ionization potential of metal clusters and the solid has been used for the cluster size estimation for Na, Cu and Ag clusters. The presence of neutral and charged metal clusters in the Pb cluster beam created by magnetron-based source has offered an independent method for estimating cluster dimensions from core-level spectra, in which the charge states are resolved...|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{two-dimensional}} {{materials such as}} Graphene and monolayers of hexagonal boron nitride have moved increasingly into the spotlight of science and research due to their extraordinary properties. This thesis {{is devoted to the}} investigation of the phenomena that occur during ion irradiation and carbon radical exposure of graphene and monolayer hexagonal boron nitride resting on a metal substrate. The resulting surface morphologies are studied by scanning tunneling microscopy and low-energy electron diffraction, whereas X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption provide chemical information. The experimental data is corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations shedding light on the microscopic mechanisms. In the first part, we study the response of graphene and monolayer hexagonal boron nitride resting on an Ir(111) substrate to ion irradiation. We show that over a broad parameter space ion irradiation of graphene and monolayer hexagonal boron nitride results in noble gas trapping at the interface of the two-dimensional layers and their metal supports. The two-dimensional layers act as one-way valves which upon annealing seal the trapped species in highly pressurized blisters. We find that the one-way valve effect results {{from the fact that the}} energetic particles can easily penetrate the two-dimensional sheet, then lose most of their energy to the substrate, making a return through the covering layer virtually impossible. Moreover, even though the two-dimensional layers are highly perforated, the edges of the holes bind strongly to the metal substrate and thereby prevent the escape from underneath. Since the phenomenon holds for ion exposure of graphene and monolayers of hexagonal boron nitride it must be assumed to take place for a broad range of materials out of the zoo of two-dimensional matter. We describe ways to avoid blister formation during graphene growth, and also demonstrate how ion implantation can be used to intentionally create blisters under a perfect two-dimensional layer without introducing damage to it. By varying the incident angle of ion irradiation we find that at large impact angles graphene can be eroded without noble gas trapping. This finding is relevant to avoid undesired effects in graphene and other two-dimensional sheets upon ion beam nanopatterning. Moreover, with scanning tunneling microscopy we image through the hexagonal boron nitride blister lid and find a superstructure corresponding in lattice parameter to what we expect for a crystalline Xe layer. We conclude that due to the strong adhesion of twodimensional layers to Ir(111) the pressure inside the blisters is in the GPa range resulting in Xe solidification. By exposing graphene and monolayer hexagonal boron nitride to high ion doses, the twodimensional layers are amorphized. Surprisingly, upon annealing, graphene as well as monolayer hexagonal boron nitride recover to perfection, except of vacancy islands resulting from sputtering and noble gas blisters. Finally, we study the potential of graphene as a sputtering shield for the underlying metal substrate. It is demonstrated that effcient sputter protection relies on self-repair of the ion damage in graphene, which takes place effciently in the temperature range of chemical vapor deposition growth. The second part of this thesis is dedicated to carbon radical exposure of graphene on Ir(111). We comprehensively discuss the different pathways for carbon radicals deposited onto graphene on Ir(111) over a broad range of deposition temperatures. At high temperatures we observe graphene bilayer growth. To go beyond, we provide evidence for a hitherto unknown mechanism of carbon incorporation into the preexisting graphene layer resulting in in-plane compression and eventually in wrinkle formation upon cool down. The discovery of this phenomenon is of greatest importance for Gr bilayer growth via radical carbon deposition as wrinkle formation will deteriorate the graphene quality. At low deposition temperature we reveal that upon carbon deposition onto the moiré formed by graphene and Ir(111) a periodic carbon <b>cluster</b> <b>lattice</b> emerges...|$|E

40|$|As {{described}} in the text, each trial of the study consisted {{of a pair of}} networks, one of each condition – a <b>clustered</b> <b>lattice</b> network condition and a random network condition – between which subjects were randomly assigned. The schema for this design is shown in Figure S 1. Once subjects were assigned to a network condition, they were randomly assigned to one node in the network. In each condition, a single, randomly selected node was not filled with a subject – this node was used as the “seed node ” for initiating the diffusion dynamics once the network was populated. In each trial, both networks had the same degree (each node had the same number of neighbors as every other node), and the same overall size (each network had the same total number of nodes). Within each trial, the only difference between conditions was the topological structure of the ties that connected the participants. Consequently, any difference in the dynamics of diffusion between conditions was due to the effects of network topology on the spread of behavior. Six independent trials of the study were run.

40|$|How do social {{networks}} affect {{the spread of}} behavior? A popular hypothesis states that networks with many clustered ties and a large diameter will be less effective for behavioral diffusion than “randomized ” networks, in which locally redundant ties are rewired to provide shortcuts across the social space. A competing hypothesis argues that when behaviors require social reinforcement, random networks lack the local structure to support behavioral adoption, suggesting that networks with more clustering and a larger diameter may be more advantageous for some diffusion processes. We investigated the effects of network structure on diffusion experimentally by studying the spread of health behavior through artificially structured online communities. The results show that individual adoption was much more likely when participants received social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the social network. This produced the striking finding that the behavior spread farther and faster across <b>clustered</b> <b>lattice</b> networks than across corresponding random networks. 2 The Spread of Behavior in an Online Social Network Experimen...|$|R

These results imply that even if we restrict our solutions to form a chain of clustering, like the one we get from hierarchical algorithms, we cannot rely on the functional values in order to choose the number of clusters.

40|$|While the new {{economic}} geography of trade and location has, understandably enough, concentrated on developing models of stylised relationships, it now seems that a review of some techniques which may be applied in empirical testing could prove useful. It is this task that will be approached here, conditioned by the advances taking place in {{new economic}} geography on the one hand, and in spatial data analysis on the other. Spatial data analysis ranges from the visualization and exploration of spatial data, through spatial statistics to spatial econometrics. The techniques involved are intended to explore for and demonstrate the presence of dependence between observations in space. Typically, observations are classified into three broad types: fields or surfaces with values at least theoretically observable over the whole study area, as in geostatistics, point patterns representing the occurrence of an observation, such as reported cases in epidemiology, and finally lattice observations, where attribute values adhere to a tesselation of the study area.
