25|$|One other notable change {{occurred}} during the 1916 modifications. The high voltage propulsion control was replaced with a safer low voltage propulsion control, which utilized battery voltage (32 volts) to control the train's motors. This battery voltage was what would pass through the motorman's <b>control</b> <b>stand</b> and between cars. Tractive effort throughout the train was synchronized by the battery voltage in this way. Meanwhile, each car would respond individually to the battery voltage, by moving its own 600 volt contacts to direct power obtained locally by each car directly from the third rail toward the motors. Using 32 volts to control the propulsion in this way was a much safer proposition for trainmen and shop personnel than the 600 volts associated with the older high voltage setup.|$|E
25|$|All of the cars, as {{originally}} built, featured high voltage propulsion control equipment, which sent 600 volts through the motorman's <b>control</b> <b>stand</b> {{as well as}} through the train via the use of jumpers between cars. This had to be the case to make the electrical contacts to allow all of the motor cars of a train to draw power in a synchronized effort from the Third rail. However, this could be dangerous for motormen and shop personnel alike by creating an electrocution hazard. Even unpowered trailer cars had to carry the 600 volts through these jumpers, because it was necessary to pass on the voltage to motor cars behind the trailer so as to synchronize them with the lead car. Motors, manufactured either by Westinghouse or General Electric, were 200 horsepower each. Each motor car was equipped with two motors.|$|E

40|$|Ground beetle assemblages {{were studied}} during 2003 - 08 in the Pisz Forest by {{comparing}} stands disturbed by a tornado to undisturbed <b>control</b> <b>stands.</b> The following exploratory questions were put forward. (1) How do the carabid assemblages change during six {{years following the}} tornado impact? (2) Does the carabid assemblage recovery begin during the six first post-tornado years? To assess the state of carabid assemblages we used two indices: the MIB (Mean Individual Biomass) and the SPC (Sum of Progressive Characteristics). Carabid assemblages in the disturbed and in the <b>control</b> <b>stands,</b> as expressed by these two indices, were compared using {{the length of a}} regression distance (sample distance in a MIB:SPC coordinate system). A cluster analysis revealed that the assemblages of the disturbed and the <b>control</b> <b>stands</b> were different. The tornado-impacted stands produced lower carabid catch rates, but species richness was significantly higher there than in the <b>control</b> <b>stands.</b> They hosted lower proportions of individuals of European species, of large zoophages, and of forest and brachypterous species, than did <b>control</b> <b>stands.</b> The observed reduction in SPC and MIB, and an increase in the regression distances may indicate that the carabid assemblages had not started to recover from the tornado-caused disturbance. Carabid assemblages apparently responded to the tornado in two steps. Firstly, the first three years were characterized by moderate decreases of index values. Secondly, from the fourth to the sixth year after the tornado, many observed changes became magnified. We did not observe clear signals of the recovery of forest carabid assemblages during the six follow-up years...|$|R

30|$|Both {{wildland}} fire and mechanical harvest {{have been proposed}} to achieve ecological restoration goals in giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum [Lindl.] Buchholz) groves of the southern Sierra Nevada, but their effectiveness on giant sequoia regeneration has received little attention. In the summer of 2010, we examined giant sequoia regeneration in four groves subjected to: 1) moderate- to high-severity wildfire in 1987 (Case Mountain, Redwood Mountain groves), 2) low-severity wildfire in 2008 (Black Mountain grove), 3) retention harvest (removal of all trees except large-diameter giant sequoia) followed by prescribed burning in the mid- 1980 s (Black Mountain, Bearskin groves), and 4) nearby unburned and unharvested (<b>control)</b> <b>stands</b> in all groves. Density of giant sequoia regeneration was greater in the moderate- and high-severity wildfire <b>stands</b> than <b>control</b> <b>stands,</b> {{but there was no}} difference in giant sequoia regeneration between low-severity burned and <b>control</b> <b>stands.</b> Stands thinned by retention harvest and prescribed burning had greater giant sequoia regeneration than <b>control</b> <b>stands.</b> Across all <b>control</b> and low- to moderate-severity wildfire stands, giant sequoia regeneration was positively associated with canopy gaps. In wildfire and retention harvest stands, giant sequoia regeneration was positively associated with distance to gap edge, direct and indirect solar radiation, and soil moisture. Our results corroborate previous studies in finding that giant sequoia regeneration benefits from fire. Both wildfire and prescribed fire (preceded by harvest or not) can serve to promote giant sequoia regeneration, providing that fire intensity is sufficient to create canopy gaps, increase understory light, and remove surface litter.|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{effects of}} an experimental fuels reduction program on elk, mule deer, and their habitat at the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range (Starkey) in northeastern Oregon. From 2001 to 2003, 26 stands of true fir and Douglas-fir that suffered high rates of mortality from an outbreak of spruce budworm were selectively thinned (spring or summer) and burned (fall) while 27 similar stands were left untreated to serve as experimental controls. We used location data for elk and mule deer collected during spring (1 April– 14 June) and summer (15 June– 31 August) of 1999 – 2006 to compare use of treated and untreated stands through time and to evaluate effects of topography, roads, weather, interspecific competition, and stand size and shape on use of treated stands. In addition, we estimated percent cover, percent digestibility, and percent nitrogen (%N) of 16 important forage species in treatment and <b>control</b> <b>stands</b> at Starkey during {{spring and summer of}} 2005 and 2006. During spring, female elk selected burned <b>stands</b> and avoided <b>control</b> <b>stands</b> when determining where to establish home ranges. Use of treated stands by elk in spring, however, was not strongly related to environmental variables considered in our study. Conversely, in summer, female elk selected <b>control</b> <b>stands</b> and either avoided or used burned stands proportional to their availability. Also in contrast to results for spring, use of treated stands by elk in summer was strongly influenced by topography, proximity to open roads, stand size and shape, and competition with cattle. Patterns of stand use by female mule deer did not change significantly following fuels reduction, and mule deer avoided or used all stand types proportional to their availability in both seasons. Patterns of stand use also differed substantially between female and male elk. During spring, females selected older (4 -year old) burns, whereas males avoided all treated <b>stands.</b> In addition, <b>control</b> <b>stands</b> were avoided by females but selected by males during spring. During summer, however, <b>control</b> <b>stands</b> were selected and treatment stands either avoided or used in proportion to their availability by both sexes.

30|$|Forest floor removal by fire can impact {{long-term}} {{site productivity}} through {{the loss of}} soil organic matter and modifications to nutrient supply (Certini 2005). Simard et al. (2001) found that in the black spruce forest of the Clay Belt, soil burns reduced organic carbon content compared to logging. Nitrogen losses (especially through volatilization) have been frequently reported in various ecosystems (e.g., Johnson and Curtis 2001; Wan et al. 2001; Boerner et al. 2009; Nave et al. 2011; Kishchuk et al. 2014; Maynard et al. 2014), and several {{studies have shown that}} base cation (i.e. K+, Ca++, Mg++) concentrations are usually higher in the forest floor following fire than after logging (Simard et al. 2001; Thiffault et al. 2007). However, in the Clay Belt, both Simard et al. (2001) and Lafleur et al. (2016) failed to detect any differences in total N and base cation concentrations between burned and logged stands. Nevertheless, Simard et al. (2001) found that approximately 20  years after disturbance concentrations of N and Ca were significantly higher in disturbed stands (either by fire or logging) relative to <b>control</b> <b>stands.</b> Moreover, Simard et al. (2001) found that logged stands had a greater total mass of nutrients (N, P and Ca) than either burned or <b>control</b> <b>stands,</b> whereas the concentration and mass of mineralizable N in the forest floor were significantly greater in logged than in burned and <b>control</b> <b>stands.</b>|$|R

30|$|For {{overstory}} trees, stem densities declined for {{all species}} in all treatments over time, indicating the overstocked status of these stands (Gingrich 1967). Decreases in density in <b>control</b> <b>stands</b> resulted from self-thinning {{and in other}} treatments from mechanical thinning. Similar to other research in southern Ohio (Hutchinson et al. 2012), we observed a 10 % natural overstory mortality rate per decade in the <b>control</b> <b>stands,</b> and after one and three burns, stem density declined by 19 % and 11 %, respectively. Thinning alone and in combination with burning decreased large stem densities; large red maple stems were eliminated after the heavy thin and three burns, leaving no residual large red maple. In contrast, others have reported that single fires {{have no effect on}} large-diameter stems, such as overstory oaks (Thomas-Van Gundy et al. 2015), but multiple fires can eventually cause a reduction in saplings (Waldrop et al. 2008, Arthur et al. 2015). Repeated prescribed fires are necessary to target fire-sensitive species in the overstory.|$|R

We investigated the impacts of mechanical thinning and on-site fuel disposal on forest herbaceous layer productivity in four coniferous forest types (lodgepole pine, mixed-conifer, ponderosa pine, and pinyon juniper) across Colorado. Crews sampled the herbaceous layer in treated stands and in adjacent unthinned <b>control</b> <b>stands</b> across 18 study sites. Treated pinyon-juniper and ponderosa pine forests had twice the graminoid cover and forb cover of <b>control</b> <b>stands.</b> Lodgepole pine and mixed-conifer forests had similar covers of graminoids and forbs in treated and <b>control</b> <b>stands.</b> Within treated ponderosa and pinyon-juniper stands, herbaceous cover was negatively correlated with mulch depth, while in lodgepole and mixed-conifer forests, there was no relationship between mulch depth and herbaceous cover. Several factors may explain the differences observed between the ecosystems. Mulch depths tended to be higher in lodgepole (4. 2 cm) and mixed-conifer (6. 1 cm) treatments relative to ponderosa (3. 7 cm) or pinyon-juniper (1. 7 cm) treatments. Mulch depths in lodgepole and mixed-conifer may exceed the threshold where understory vegetation can grow, overriding the influence of increased light availability due to overstory thinning. Alternately, the overstory of lodgepole and mixed conifer are naturally dense compared to ponderosa and pinyon-juniper, and may lack sufficient understory flora to respond to canopy reduction. Consideration of the variability in treatment impacts (e. g., amount and distribution of mulch) combined with differences in overstory and understory species structure and composition are critical for design of “Best Management Practices” guidelines for mulching treatments in western US forests...|$|R
