40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD) on the relevance of company-sponsored <b>conference</b> <b>calls.</b> Measuring relevance by a <b>conference</b> <b>call's</b> ability to improve analyst forecast accuracy and consensus, I find larger improvements in both variables during the period surrounding <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> in the post-FD era versus the pre-FD era. These findings imply that in the post-FD era relatively more about a firm's upcoming earnings becomes known during <b>conference</b> <b>calls,</b> consistent with FD's success in eliminating selective disclosure.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> provide additional information to analysts. For a large sample of <b>conference</b> <b>calls,</b> hosted by German firms between 2004 and 2007, our {{results show that}} <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> improve analysts’ ability to forecast future earnings accurately. This suggests that additional information is released during <b>conference</b> <b>calls.</b> The reduction in forecast error is economically significant and larger in magnitude when compared to results for the US (Bowen et al., 2002). These {{findings are consistent with}} the notion that commiting to additional disclosures is likely to yield greater effects in a less stringent disclosure system (Verrecchia, 2001). Since the majority of our sample firms conduct <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> as closed calls, the evidence of this paper suggests that <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> may contribute to an information gap between call participants and non-invited parties. Our findings should be of substantial interest to European regulators seeking to level the informational playing field for all investors...|$|R
40|$|Telephone <b>calls</b> and multi-party <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> are {{transmitted}} {{and controlled by}} computer much like electronic documents. However, the way we traditionally use <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> {{is very different from}} the way we use documents. This is primarily due to the transient unstructured nature of audio, and the lack of tools for managing, manipulating, and displaying telephone conversations and <b>conference</b> <b>calls.</b> This work is aimed at letting people use <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> in many of the same ways that they use documents. This paper describes a system for turning <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> into archived documents that can be browsed, skimmed, displayed, hyperlinked and annotated on the World Wide Web. The “Conference Scribe ” system has three principle components: the “SkimServer ” for recording and playback, the “IDB Server ” for storing and retrieving time stamped labels, and a Java applet for interactively skimming recordings. The parallels between <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> and documents are reviewed, and form the basis for the design of the system. 1...|$|R
5|$|His non-selection in {{previous}} years was widely debated in the media. Bure was often compared with Cam Neely, a player who also waited six years for induction; he recorded similar goals-per-game numbers in a career that was also shortened to 700-plus games. It had been often rumoured that Pat Quinn, Bure's former head coach and general manager in Vancouver, who became co-chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame's selection committee, opposed Bure's induction. However, in a <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> following his selection, Quinn {{was among the most}} prominent figures he thanked.

5|$|Although {{preliminary}} {{reports from}} Reuters suggested an Oblivion release {{in tandem with}} the launch of the Xbox 360 on November 22, 2005, and the original announcement of the game set a release date of Winter 2005, Take-Two Interactive announced, during a <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> with analysts on October 31, 2005, that Oblivions release was to be delayed until the second quarter of Take-Two's fiscal year. The new schedule would put the release between February and April 2006. The delay surprised many, especially online retailers, who had begun accepting pre-orders for consoles bundled with Oblivion. News of the delay came at a time following a burst of bad news from the company, including a 60% drop in expected earnings per share, the ongoing Hot Coffee minigame controversy, worse than average sales for the company's flagship , sudden drops in share prices, and delays for other company products.|$|E

5|$|Before Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was released, it was {{predicted}} to sell even more copies than the highly successful Halo 3; it had received reviews as high as Halo 3s, it was launching on three systems as opposed to one for Halo 3, and demand for the game led {{to a wide range}} of retailers only having enough available to satisfy pre-orders. It fulfilled the prediction and the Xbox 360 version became the best-selling video game in the United States from November 2007 to January 2008 according to the NPD Group. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions would go on to sell 1.57 million and 444,000 units, respectively, in the United States in November 2007. 1.47 million units of the Xbox 360 version were sold in December 2007; the game sold 331,000 copies for the Xbox 360 and 140,000 copies for the PlayStation 3 in January 2008. The Xbox 360 version was the third best-selling video game of 2007 in the U.S. with 3.04 million units sold, behind Halo 3, which sold 4.82 million units, according to the NPD Group. By January 2008, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare had sold more than 7 million copies worldwide, and was the best-selling game of 2007.
