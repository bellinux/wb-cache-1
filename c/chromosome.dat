5|$|It has a diploid <b>chromosome</b> {{number of}} 2n = 34, which is {{unusual for the}} genus Drosera {{and closer to the}} diploid <b>chromosome</b> number of the Venus flytrap (Dionaeamuscipula), another member of the Droseraceae. Variable <b>chromosome</b> counts for Dionaea from {{multiple}} studies include 2n = 30, 32, and 33. Of the Drosera species with known <b>chromosome</b> counts, most are a multiple of x = 10. Based on an extensive review of karyotype studies, the botanist Fernando Rivadavia suggested that the base <b>chromosome</b> number for the genus could be 2n = 20, a number that many Drosera species share including the widespread D.rotundifolia. Exceptions to this base number include the Australian, New Zealand and Southeast Asian Drosera, which have <b>chromosome</b> numbers ranging from 2n = 6 to 64.|$|E
5|$|Published <b>chromosome</b> counts {{exist for}} two species, Aiphanes minima and A.horrida; haploid <b>chromosome</b> counts vary from 15 to 18.

5|$|The APOA5 gene resides on <b>chromosome</b> 11 at {{the band}} 11q23 and {{contains}} 4 exons and 3 introns. This gene uses alternate polyadenylation sites and is located proximal to the apolipoprotein gene cluster on <b>chromosome</b> 11q23.|$|E

5|$|All North American Drosera species {{except for}} D. anglica have a <b>chromosome</b> count of 2n=20. In 1955, Wood noted that D. anglica had a <b>chromosome</b> count of 2n=40, and {{hypothesized}} {{that it was}} of hybrid amphidiploid origin. Since the leaf morphology of D. anglica is an intermediary between that of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis and the two occur sympatrically in several locations, Wood conjectured that D. anglica likely originated from a hybrid between these two.|$|E
50|$|Normally, {{homologous}} <b>chromosomes</b> pair up in bivalents during meiosis {{and separate}} into different daughter cells. However, when multiple copies of similar <b>chromosomes</b> {{are present in}} the nucleus, homeologous <b>chromosomes</b> can also pair with homologous <b>chromosomes</b> resulting in the formation of trivalents or multivalents (4). The formation of multivalents results in unequal division of the <b>chromosomes</b> and lead to daughter cells lacking one or few <b>chromosomes.</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{are more}} than 20 {{different}} Fragaria species worldwide. Numbers of other species have been proposed, {{some of which are}} now recognized as subspecies. Key to the classification of strawberry species is recognizing that they vary in the number of <b>chromosomes.</b> There are seven basic types of <b>chromosomes</b> that they all have in common. However, they exhibit different polyploidy. Some species are diploid, having two sets of the seven <b>chromosomes</b> (14 <b>chromosomes</b> total). Others are tetraploid (four sets, 28 <b>chromosomes</b> total), hexaploid (six sets, 42 <b>chromosomes</b> total), octoploid (eight sets, 56 <b>chromosomes</b> total), or decaploid (ten sets, 70 <b>chromosomes</b> total).|$|R

5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is thought to}} be caused by a mutation in a gene on the X <b>chromosome.</b> A 2007 study concluded, based on analysis of microsatellite markers (small gene sequences found in common among individuals having the same ethnicity, ancestry or genetic disease) of the family described by Keipert, that this gene was likely located on the long arm of the X <b>chromosome</b> between positions Xq22.2q28. This is not definitive, however, and no specific gene has been named.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) {{typically}} {{store their}} genomes {{on a single}} large, circular <b>chromosome.</b> Similarly, some eukaryotic organelles contain a remnant circular <b>chromosome</b> with {{a small number of}} genes. Prokaryotes sometimes supplement their <b>chromosome</b> with additional small circles of DNA called plasmids, which usually encode only a few genes and are transferable between individuals. For example, the genes for antibiotic resistance are usually encoded on bacterial plasmids and can be passed between individual cells, even those of different species, via horizontal gene transfer.|$|E

5|$|Sterility in a non-polyploid hybrid {{is often}} a result of <b>chromosome</b> number; if parents are of differing <b>chromosome</b> pair number, the {{offspring}} will have an odd number of chromosomes, which leaves them unable to produce chromosomally-balanced gametes. While that is undesirable in a crop such as wheat, for which growing a crop that produces no seeds would be pointless, it is an attractive attribute in some fruits. Triploid bananas and watermelons are intentionally bred because they produce no seeds and are also parthenocarpic.|$|E
5|$|The animal has a {{karyotype}} of 46 chromosomes, with a {{total of}} 50 major arms on the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes). The X <b>chromosome</b> is submetacentric (with one arm slightly longer than the other) and the Y <b>chromosome</b> is small and acrocentric (with one very short and one long arm). The karyotype is conserved among species of Miniopterus; the number of chromosomes and arms is identical in M.griveaudi, the Malagasy M.aelleni and M.gleni, and even the Asian M.fuliginosus.|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the wildebeest is 58. Chromosomes were studied in {{a male and}} a female wildebeest.

Metaphases were studied in the male's chromosomes, and very large submetacentric chromosomes were found there as well, similar to those in the female both in size and morphology. Other chromosomes were acrocentric. The X <b>chromosome</b> is a large acrocentric and the Y <b>chromosome</b> a minute one.|$|E
50|$|Chromosomal {{instability}} (CIN) {{is a type}} of genomic {{instability in}} which <b>chromosomes</b> are unstable, such that either whole <b>chromosomes</b> or parts of <b>chromosomes</b> are duplicated or deleted. The unequal distribution of DNA to daughter cells upon mitosis results in a failure to maintain euploidy (the correct number of <b>chromosomes)</b> leading to aneuploidy (incorrect number of <b>chromosomes).</b> In other words, the daughter cells {{do not have the same}} number of <b>chromosomes</b> as the cell they originated from.|$|R
50|$|The ancestral sheep {{is presumed}} to have had 60 <b>chromosomes,</b> as in goats (Capra).
