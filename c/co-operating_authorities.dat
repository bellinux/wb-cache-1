40|$|Analyses the European Court of Justice {{ruling in}} Ordre des Barreaux Francophones et Germanophone v Conseil des Ministres (C- 305 / 05) {{on the extent}} to which the {{obligations}} to <b>co-operate</b> with <b>authorities</b> in relation to money laundering, placed on lawyers by Directive 91 / 308, were compatible with legal professional privilege. Outlines the scope of the privilege under UK and EC law and of Directive 91 / 308. Criticises the reference to the Court and the Court's ruling. Compares the ruling with the Advocate General's opinion in the matter. Speculates on the implications of the ruling for UK law...|$|R

50|$|Syed Hammad Raza Shaheed (9 January 1970 - 14 May 2007), Additional Registrar, Supreme Court of Pakistan, was a {{civil servant}} {{belonging}} to the elite District Management Group of Central Superior Services of Pakistan. He was a close confidant of the suspended Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, and served as his virtual staff officer until his gruesome murder on 14 May 2007.

50|$|If the OFT proves its case, the {{retailers}} could theoretically face fines {{of up to}} 10 per cent of their worldwide turnover, which in Tesco's case would amount to £4.3bn. The Office of Fair Trading told Sainsbury's, Asda, Safeway, Dairy Crest, Wiseman and The Cheese Company they faced maximum fines of £116m, though the final figure may be as low as £80m {{as a result of}} their co-operation. Sainsbury's told the London Stock Exchange that its fine was £26m. The fine for Safeway is thought to be between £8m and £10m; £9m for Dairy Crest and £6m for Robert Wiseman. It is unclear who blew the whistle on the price-fixing but Arla, the dairy processor, will escape a fine after fully <b>co-operating</b> with <b>authorities.</b> Consumer advocate Which?

Baptiste's results from competitions between the backdated start of the ban and August 2013 (when the failed test was announced and she was first suspended from competing) were all annulled in accordance with IAAF rules; her national records of 10.83 (100 m) and 22.36 (200 m) from the June 2013 national championships were wiped out.|$|R

5000|$|In Italian law, Article 41-bis of the Prison Administration Act (also {{known as}} Italy's [...] "hard prison regime") is a {{provision}} that allows the Minister of Justice or the Minister of the Interior to suspend certain prison regulations. Currently it is used against people imprisoned for particular crimes: Mafia involvement; drug-trafficking; homicide; aggravated robbery and extortion; kidnapping; importation, buying, possession or cession of huge amounts of drugs; and crimes committed for terrorism or for subversion of the constitutional system. It is suspended only when a prisoner <b>co-operates</b> with the <b>authorities,</b> when a court annuls it, or when a prisoner dies.

40|$|The allocative and {{productive}} inefficiencies generated by cartels have induced many govern- ments to tackle them aggressively, thus making those agreements {{increasingly difficult to}} detect.

The Committee of 81, a student organisation representing coloured schools in the Western Cape which organised student boycotts and protests, held some meetings at the school in 1985. The school effectively stopped teaching from February and was officially closed on 6 September when the government ordered more than 400 schools to close as a result of civil unrest. Some teachers resigned their positions and others were confused as to their role.

50|$|Although the Doukhobor {{religion}} and world view had traditionally espoused non-violence, the dangerous conditions {{of life in}} the southern borderlands of Russian Empire and the necessity to <b>co-operate</b> with the <b>authorities</b> resulted in the Doukhobors of the mid- and late-19th century owning and using weapons for self-defence, and, when conscripted, joining the Russian military. However, as a moral and religious revival, inspired by the exiled community leader Peter Vasilevich Verigin and by Leo Tolstoy's philosophy of non-violence, by 1895 many of the Doukhobors living in Transcaucasia resolved to destroy the weapons they owned. Those of them who had already served in the military returned their reservist registration cards to the authorities, meanwhile the young Doukhobor conscripts currently in the army returned their weapons to their commanders and refused further service.|$|R
500|$|Writing for The New Republic, Russian-American {{journalist}} Julia Ioffe {{commented that}} {{by arguing that}} Samutsevich was innocent because she had not participated, Khrunova's defense had implied that Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina had in fact committed a crime, and had cut off [...] "the one path to redemption that the group actually had: ignoring the court’s proceedings and denying its legitimacy". Some commentators saw Samutsevich's unexpected release as a divide and rule tactic {{on the part of}} the authorities. Details later emerged of an alleged Nasedka ("mother hen"), a prisoner who spies on fellow inmates and manipulates them into <b>co-operating</b> with the <b>authorities</b> in return for privileges and early parole. A convicted fraudster named Irina Orlova was placed in the same cell as Samutsevich, where she apparently gained her trust and persuaded her to change lawyers.

40|$|The mid- to late tenth {{century has}} been seen as a period in which the kings of León saw their ability to project their power {{throughout}} their regnum challenged by the emergence of a magnate class increasingly disinclined to <b>co-operate</b> with public <b>authority.</b> This article aims to re-examine this premise via the following approach: first, a discussion of common problems and misconceptions related to notions of public power and government as these terms are used in an early medieval Spanish historiographical context; second, a case study which examines the roles of political actors in one relatively well-documented region of the kingdom. It argues that structures designed to deliver justice and maintain order in the region depended much more on the participation of local actors than they did on the king's official agents; the wider implications for our understanding of public authority are then considered anew...|$|R
