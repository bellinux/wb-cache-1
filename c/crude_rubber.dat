The product {{for which it}} is best known, however, is its oil. Conservative estimates say that Cabinda accounts for close to 60% of Angola’s oil production, estimated at approximately , and it is estimated that oil exports from the province are worth the equivalent of US$100,000 per annum for every Cabindan. Yet Cabinda remains one of the poorest provinces in Angola. An agreement in 1996 between the national and provincial governments stipulated that 10% of Cabinda’s taxes on oil revenues would be given back to the province, but Cabindans often feel that these revenues do not benefit the population as a whole, largely because of corruption. The private sector, particularly the oil industry, has both affected and been affected by the secessionist conflict. During the early days of Cabinda's struggle, the oil companies were perceived as sympathetic to, if not supportive of, Cabinda’s self-determination cause. The strategy used by the separatists to gain international attention, was most evident in 1999 and 2000. During 1999, FLEC-R kidnapped four foreign workers (two Portuguese and two French citizens), but released them after several months, having failed {{to attract the attention of}} the international community. FLEC-FAC also increased its activities during 2000 with the more widely-publicized kidnapping of three Portuguese workers employed by a construction company, while FLEC-R kidnapped another five Portuguese civilians.

By early 1957, prototypes were running, and by mid-1957 the project was given an official drawing office project number (ADO15) so that the thousands of drawings required for production could be produced. In August 1959 the car was launched as the Morris Mini Minor and the Austin Seven, which soon became known as the Austin Mini. In later years, the car would become known simply as the Mini. Due to time pressures, the interconnected suspension system that Issigonis had planned for the car was replaced by an equally novel, but <b>cruder,</b> <b>rubber</b> cone system designed by Alex Moulton. The Mini {{went on to become the}} best selling British car in history with a production run of 5.3 million cars. This ground-breaking design, with its front wheel drive, transverse engine, sump gearbox, 10-inch wheels, and phenomenal space efficiency, was still being manufactured in 2000 and has been the inspiration for almost all small front-wheel drive cars produced since the early 1960s.|$|R

The purpose of this paper is to develop regional economic planning through sectoral oriented development model in Eastern Java Province. This paper uses dynamic Input-output model presented by Leontieff (1982), has been widely applied in many domestic and abroad researchers. As we know that Input-output model is static model.

This paper also aims to figure out the economic problem facing East Java Province.

5000|$|This {{is defined}} as a device that {{reflects}} and absorbs waves of oscillatory energy, extending from a piece of working machinery or electrical equipment, and with the desired effect being vibration insulation. The goal is to establish vibration isolation between a body transferring mechanical fluctuations and a supporting body (for example, between the machine and the foundation). The illustration shows a vibration isolator from the series «ВИ» (~"VI" [...] in Roman characters), as used in shipbuilding in Russia, for example the submarine [...] "St.Petersburg" [...] (Lada). The depicted «ВИ» devices allow loadings ranging from 5, 40 and 300 kg. They differ in their physical sizes, but all share the same fundamental design. The structure consists of a rubber envelope that is internally reinforced by a spring. During manufacture, the rubber and the spring are intimately and permanently connected {{as a result of the}} vulcanization process that is integral to the processing of the <b>crude</b> <b>rubber</b> material. Under action of weight loading of the machine, the rubber envelope deforms, and the spring is compressed or stretched. Therefore, in the direction of the spring's cross section, twisting of the enveloping rubber occurs. The resulting elastic deformation of the rubber envelope results in very effective absorption of the vibration. This absorption is crucial to reliable vibration insulation, because it averts the potential for resonance effects. The amount of elastic deformation of the rubber largely dictates the magnitude of vibration absorption that can be attained; the entire device (including the spring itself) must be designed with this in mind. The design of the vibration isolator must also take into account potential exposure to shock loadings, in addition to the routine everyday vibrations. Lastly, the vibration isolator must also be designed for long-term durability as well as convenient integration into the environment in which it is to be used. Sleeves and flanges are typically employed in order to enable the vibration isolator to be securely fastened to the equipment and the supporting foundation.|$|E

While the production factor significantly rubber production are amount of the harvesting of labour, amount of land area, the number of tree/hectare, cost of production, Ethrel stimunlansia, dummy tapping system and dummy tapping technology. Based on regression analysis, production factors that partially significantly influencing the rubber production is the harvest of labour, amount of land area, the number tree/hectare, cost of production, Ethrel stimulansia, dummy tapping system and dummy tapping technology...|$|E
40|$|A {{process for}} the aerobic {{biological}} decomposition of guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) prior to extraction of the rubber by mechanical means was patented by Spence (1933). The process, called retting because of the loose analogy to the retting of flax {{for the production of}} linen fiber, produced a marked decrease in the impurities of the rubber and improved the physical properties of the vulcanized rubber. It also decreased the resinous acetone-soluble contam-inant from about 20 per cent of the <b>crude</b> <b>rubber</b> product to about 10 per cent, but no conclusions were drawn as to the agent responsible for the changes in composition and properties. The work reported in this paper is one phase of a reinvestigation of the retting of guayule by the natural microflora; it deals specifically with the decomposition of guayule resins. The resin of guayule is a mixture of acetone-soluble constituents of the plant. When the shrub is injured a clear resin exudes and dries. Other resin preparations were made by exhaustive extraction of guayule rubber with acetone and removal of the solvent. A variety of microorganisms normally present in the soil flora have been shown to oxidize compounds ordinarily considered relatively resistant to biochemical oxidation. Numerous species of bacteria have been found to oxidize phenols, and aromatic, alicyclic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. The literature on these subjects prior to 1940 is briefly reviewed by Bushnell and Haas (1941). Many species of actinomycetes oxidize aliphatic hydrocarbons (Umbreit, 1939) and the olefinic rubber hydrocarbon (Spence and Van Niel, 1936; Kalinenko, 1938, 1940; ZoBell and Grant, 1942). Fungi, especially species of Aspergillus and Peni-ciUium, have also been shown to oxidize aliphatic hydrocarbons (Rahn, 1906) an...|$|E
