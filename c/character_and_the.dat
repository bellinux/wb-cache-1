5|$|Aronofsky {{realized}} that since writing in 2000 the battle scene between {{the armies of}} Mayans and conquistadors, The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Troy, King Arthur, and other films had featured massive battle scenes. He felt less inclined to mimic the scale and rewrote the battle to be mainly between Jackman's conquistador <b>character</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mayans. The director {{realized that}}, with one man against the army, the rewrite was a suitable metaphor for his film's theme of a man defying odds to do the impossible and conquer death.|$|E

5|$|Bloom {{says that}} some of the {{characters}} have not stood the test of time, writing that modern readers are uncomfortable with the anti-semitic treatment of Cohn's <b>character</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> romanticization of a bullfighter. Moreover, Brett and Mike belong uniquely to the Jazz Age and do not translate to the modern era. Bloom believes the novel is in the canon of American literature for its formal qualities: its prose and style.|$|E

5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek <b>character</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Edgar Allan Poe's {{masterpiece}} short stories, "The Fall of the House of Usher" and "The Pit <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Pendulum.

In this thesis, I want to reveal that the psychological condition of <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> settings really influence each other. I use the theory of characterization and setting to analyze the psychological condition of <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> setting. In the analyzing I know that mental condition of the characters is influenced by <b>the</b> fearful circumstances <b>and</b> this makes their mental disorder worse; besides, the mental disorder can make the fearful circumstances more fearful.

5|$|Potassium is an {{extremely}} active metal that reacts violently with oxygen in water and air. With oxygen it forms potassium peroxide, and with water potassium forms potassium hydroxide. The reaction of potassium with water is dangerous because of its violent exothermic <b>character</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> production of hydrogen gas. Hydrogen reacts again with atmospheric oxygen, producing water, which reacts with the remaining potassium. This reaction requires only traces of water; because of this, potassium and the liquid sodium-potassium — NaK — are potent desiccants {{that can be used}} to dry solvents prior to distillation.|$|E

Official Nintendo Magazine Thomas East thought that both characters should be dropped from future Super Smash Bros. games, adding that Lucas was too similar to Ness. Both characters returned in the sequel, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, where Ness is readily available and Lucas is available as downloadable content.|$|E
