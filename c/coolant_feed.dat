Suitable manifolds are provided {{at each end of}} the rocket chamber. In addition to the cooling channel openings, <b>coolant</b> <b>feed</b> openings may be formed in each of rings. The <b>coolant</b> <b>feed</b> openings may be nested or positioned within generally U-shaped cooling channel openings.

40|$|STS- 93 was {{launched}} on July 23, 1999. There was an anomaly {{at the end}} of the launch in that the main engines shut down 0. 16 second early because sensors detected a low level of oxidizer in the LOX tank (actually the duct from the tank to the vehicle). This resulted in a cutoff velocity for the vehicle that was 16 ft/sec low. It should have been 25872 ft/sec. The OMS engines were subsequently used to achieve the proper orbit. An investigation was immediately initiated into the cause of this LOX tank low level cutoff. It was noticed during the launch that the turbine temperatures for Main Engine 3 (E 2019) were approximately 100 F higher than the preflight prediction. Linear Engine Model matching of the data indicated that a nozzle leak best fit the data. Post launch review of the data showed, that at approximately five seconds into the start, numerous parameters indicated small anomalous shifts. These shifts were all consistent with a rupture of nozzle tubes. Post launch review of the films showed that just after Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) ignition and just prior to liftoff a streak is seen in the exhaust plume of E 2019. Just after liftoff the streak can be seen emanating from the nozzle wall. This photo confirmed that a leak was coming from the nozzle tubes. Based on the photo, the axial location of the leak was estimated to be 28 in. from the aft end of the nozzle and in line with nozzle <b>coolant</b> <b>feed</b> line # 1. The streak continued to be visible during the launch...|$|E
40|$|International Conference on Process Control (PC), SLOVAKIA, JUN 18 - 21, 2013 International audienceA {{two-dimensional}} fixed-bed {{catalytic reactor}} model for acrolein production has been developped. The reactor and kinetic {{models have been}} identified by using both laboratory-scale and pilot-scale measurements. Many operating conditions such as <b>coolant</b> temperature, <b>feeding</b> rate, inlet pressure and temperature have great influence on the yield of acrolein and also on the bed temperature which are two very important parameters. More specifically, the <b>coolant</b> temperature and <b>feeding</b> rate {{are the two most}} important parameters for the acrolein production. With a set of different <b>feed</b> rates, the <b>coolant</b> temperature and the reactor inlet temperature were optimized to maximise the yield of acrolein for a given reactor length and inlet pressure. There was an optimal feeding rate for the maximum yield of acrolein. The study of the influence of number of the cooling sections with different temperatures shows that there was no significant improvement in the yield of acrolein...|$|R
40|$|High speed {{twist drills}} are {{probably}} the most common of all metal cutting tools and also the least efficient. In this study, detailed research was undertaken into aspects of drill performance and ways in which drilling could be improved in short hole depths of up to two diameters. The work included an evaluation of twist drill geometry and grinding parameters. It was established that errors in point grinding lead to increased hole oversize and reduced drill life. A fundamental analysis was made to establish predictive equations for the drill torque and thrust using modified orthogonal cutting equations and empirical data. A good correlation was obtained between actual and predicted results. Two new techniques for extending twist drill life by the use of <b>coolant</b> <b>feeding</b> holes and also the application of titanium nitride coatings were evaluated. Both methods were found to have potential for improving drill performance. A completely new design of carbide tipped drill was designed and developed. The new design was tested and it compared favourably with two commercially available carbide tipped drills. In further work an entirely different type of drill point geometry was developed for the drill screw. A new design was produced which enabled the drilling time to be minimised for the low thrust forces that were likely to be used with hand held power tools...|$|R
40|$|A {{possibility}} of applying {{the theory of}} semi-Markov (semimarkovian) processes to {{the description of the}} reliability of an automotive vehicle has been presented, with taking a passenger car as an example. In the car considered, such constructional systems (functional components) as engine with fuel, lube oil, and <b>coolant</b> <b>feeding</b> systems, clutch, gearbox, drive shaft, driving axle, steering and suspension system, braking system, electrical system, body with chassis, and measuring and monitoring equipment have been distinguished. A reliability model of the car has been developed {{in the form of a}} semi-Markov process, which is a single-state model. The set of reliability states has been built as consisting of one state of car serviceability and ten states of the functional components as specified above. A graph of changes in these states has been shown and an initial distribution and a functional matrix representing changes in the said reliability states of the car have been defined. Formulas have been derived that define the boundary distribution of the process of changes in the technical states of such a car. This distribution represents the probability of the car being serviceable and unserviceable due to a failure of any of the functional components mentioned above. The {{possibility of}} using statistics to estimate the probabilities of changes in the said car reliability states has been presented. A possibility of applying the theory of semi-Markov processes to the investigation of car reliability in the case of defining the instantaneous distribution of the process of changes in the car reliability states has also been mentioned.

50|$|Then, {{according}} to some estimations, the reactor jumped to around 30,000 MW thermal, ten times the normal operational output. The last reading on the control panel was 33,000 MW. It {{was not possible to}} reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building, but a steam explosion, like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure, appears to have been the next event. There is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the reactor's exterior cooling structure that caused the explosion that destroyed the reactor casing, tearing off and blasting the 2000-ton upper plate, to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened, through the roof of the reactor building. This {{is believed to be the}} first explosion that many heard. This explosion ruptured further fuel channels, as well as severing most of the <b>coolant</b> lines <b>feeding</b> the reactor chamber, and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core. The total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the reactor's thermal power.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{technology}} of real-time fault diagnosis for nuclear power plants(NPP) has great significance {{to improve the}} safety and economy of reactor. Nuclear power plants are complex system, which collect and monitor the vast parameters. A parameter reduction method based on fuzzy rough sets was proposed. According to the characteristics the parameters were fuzzed, and they were reducted using the algorithm of forward greedy search. The decision tree was applied to learn from training samples which were the typical faults of nuclear power plant, i. e., loss of <b>coolant</b> accident (LOCA), <b>feed</b> water pipe rupture, steam generator tube rupture (SGTR), main steam pipe rupture, and diagnose by using the acquired knowledge. The result shows that this method can diagnose the faults of the NPP rapidly and accurately...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical modelhas {{been applied}} to predict the {{performance}} of Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (DCMD) based on the analysis of heat and mass transfer through the membrane. The performance of DCMD on the account of different operating parameters had been predicted. <b>Feed</b> inlet temperature, <b>coolant</b> inlet temperature, <b>feed</b> flow rate and coolant flow rate are the considered performance variables. Based on the data obtained from theoretical model, statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) was then performed to determine the significant effect of each operating factors on the DCMD system performance. A new regression model was subsequently developed for predicting {{the performance of the}} DCMD system. Resultsrevealed that both theoretical and regression models were in good agreement with each other and also with the selected experimental data used for validation. The maximum percentage error between the two models was found to be 1. 098...|$|R
50|$|In this stage, {{the player}} has to destroy {{maintenance}} robots that <b>feed</b> <b>coolant</b> into the reactor. The number of robots {{is determined by}} the difficulty level chosen by the player. The player is provided with several disc grenades that he throws at the robot, which is moving and firing at him the entire time. The robot is reinforced at the front, so {{the only way to do}} any damage is to bounce the discs off the wall and hit the robot in the back. As the number of discs is limited, the player should attempt to catch returning discs which missed the robot. To successfully complete the game, all robots must be defeated, the final one within a two-minute time limit. If the robot is not destroyed within the limit the game is still considered complete, but with no survivors.|$|R
40|$|Austempered Ductile Iron (ADI) {{is a type}} of nodular, ductile {{cast iron}} {{subjected}} to heat treatments - austenitising and austempering. Whilst machining is conducted prior to heat treatment and offers no significant difficulty, machining post heat treatment is demanding and often avoided. Phase transformation of retained austenite to martensite leading to poor machinability characteristics is a common problem experienced during machining. This case study explains the effect of feed rate on machinability of ADI using cutting force analysis and tool failure analysis. The experimental design consists of conducting drilling trials on grade 1200 and 1400 at constant depth of cut, 25 mm; constant speed, 45 m/min; no <b>coolant</b> and variable <b>feed</b> rates from 0. 2 to 0. 35 mm/rev (increment of 0. 025 mm/rev). Metallography and X-ray diffraction technique was carried out in order to identify and quantify the microstructural phases before and after drilling. The results from the trial infer {{that the best way to}} machine ADI efficiently without tool failure is using low feeds and high speeds and without coolant...|$|R
40|$|Air Gap {{membrane}} distillation (AGMD), a special type of energy efficient {{membrane distillation}} process, is a technology for producing freshwater from waste water. Having some benefits over other traditional processes, this method {{has been able}} to draw attention of researchers working in the field of freshwater production technologies. In this study, a basic AGMD system with flat coolant plate has been modified using a specially designed channelled coolant plate of portable size to observe its effect over the production rate and performance of the system. Attempt has been made {{to increase the amount of}} distillate flux by using the “fin effect” of the channelled coolant plate. A finned plate have been used instead of a flat coolant plate and experiments were conducted to compare the effect. <b>Coolant</b> temperature and <b>feed</b> temperature of the system have been varied from 10 °C to 25 °C and 40 °C to 70 °C respectively. Comparing the data, around 50 % to 58 % distillate enhancement has been observed for channelled coolant plate. Also, it was seen that the enhancement was higher for higher <b>feed</b> temperatures and <b>coolant</b> temperatures. With these findings, a better performing AGMD module has been introduced to mitigate the scarcity of freshwater...|$|R
40|$|The polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane {{fuel cell}} (PEMFC) is an electrochemical device {{used for the}} production of power, which is a key for the transition towards green and renewable power delivery devices for mobile, stationary and back-up power applications. PEMFCs consume hydrogen and oxygen to produce power, water and heat. The transient start-up from sub-zero freezing temperature conditions is a problem for the successful, undamaged and unhindered operation. The generation and presence of water in the PEMFC stack in such an environment leads to the formation of ice that hinders the flow of gases, causes morphological changes in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) leading to reversible and irreversible degradation of stack performance. Start-up performance is highly dependent on start-up operational conditions and procedures. The previous state of the stack will influence the ability to perform upon the next start-up and operation. Water generated during normal operation is vital and improves performance when properly managed. Liquid water present at shut-down can form ice and cause unwanted start-up effects. This phase change may cause damage to the MEA and gas diffusion media due to volume expansion. Removal of high water content at shutdown decreases proton conductivity which can delay start-up times. The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has established a set of criteria that will make fuel cell technology viable when attained. As specified by DOE, an 80 kWe fuel cell will be required by 2015 to reach 50 % power in 30 seconds from start-up at an ambient temperature of - 20 °C. This work investigates freeze start-up in a multi-kilowatt stack approaching both shut-down conditioning and start-up operations to improve performance, moderate fuel cell damage and determine the limits of current stack technology. The investigation involved a Hydrogenics Corporation 5 kW 506 series fuel cell stack. The investigation is completed through conditioning the fuel cell start-up performance at various temperatures ranging from - 5 °C to below - 20 °C. The control of system start-up temperature is achieved with an environmental chamber that maintains the desired set point during dwell time and start-up. The supply gases for the experiment are conditioned at ambient stack temperature to create a realistic environment that could be experienced in colder weather climates. Temperature controls aim to maintain steady ambient temperatures during progressive start-up in order to best simulate ambient conditions. The control and operation of the fuel cell is maintained by the use of a fuel cell automated test station (FCATS™). FCATS supplies gas <b>feeds,</b> <b>coolant</b> medium and can control temperature and reactant humidity in reactants according to a prescribed procedure for continuous operation. The iv collection of data occurs by the same system recording cell voltage, temperatures, pressures, flow rates and current densities. A procedural start-up and characterization are conducted in order improve start-of performance and examine reactant flows, coolant activation time, stack conditioning and the effects by freezing temperatures. The resulting degradation is investigated by polarization curves and various ex-situ measurements. In this work, it was found that freeze start-up of a fuel cell stack can be aided and managed by conditioning the stack at shut-down and applying a procedure to successfully start-up and mitigate the damage that freezing can cause...|$|R
