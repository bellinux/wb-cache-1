Hank and Earl share everything they know with their boss, Lieutenant Washington (Bill Duke), and then pretend to approach McDuff, offering to sell him back the [...] "beer kegs" [...] for $1 million. However, Nash overhears their plans and takes Washington hostage first. During the confrontation, Earl and Hank meet with McDuff, Nash and their men near the coast, rescuing Washington and accidentally starting a shootout, but the trio manage to kill or apprehend most of Nash's gang, including McDuff. During the shootout, Hank saves Earl's life by warning him about a gunman taking aim at him, getting {{shot himself in the}} process, but survives. Earl engages in a fight with Nash while a wounded Hank gets up. He kills Nash by dropping a <b>crane</b> <b>load</b> onto an unstable slab, catapulting him into the ocean.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a nonlinear model predictive control scheme {{for the two}} main axes of an overhead travelling crane, which guarantees both tracking of desired trajectories for the <b>crane</b> <b>load</b> and an active damping of <b>crane</b> <b>load</b> oscillations. The main idea of the used NMPC algorithm consists in a minimization of the tracking error {{at the end of}} the prediction horizon. That way the computation load can be kept relatively small. The varying length of the rope is considered by gain-scheduling techniques. The position of the <b>crane</b> <b>load</b> is measured by a CMOS camera using the spatial filtering principle. Desired trajectories for the <b>crane</b> <b>load</b> position in the three-dimensional workspace can be tracked independently with high accuracy. Experimental results from an implementation on a test rig show a high control performance...|$|E

Estimation of {{one or both of}} the variables helps to reduce the high error peaks, outliers and avoids the impact of low or zero load values during ideal and off operation modes.

The results obtained in terms of maximum displacement depend on the <b>crane</b> <b>load</b> conditions and on the different schematizations used for the wind action.

40|$|Research objective: {{assessment}} {{of the impact of}} <b>crane</b> <b>loading</b> on safe operation of building by using probabilistic methods; taking into account accumulation of damage in building’s structural elements occurring during operation period. Materials and methods: current computational schemes exploit procedures that do not take into consideration all external effects and changes in structures occurring during operation period of an industrial building.

Results: the experimental and theoretical research carried out by the author resulted in more precise definitions for computational models and for computational methods of analysis of industrial buildings under the action of various <b>crane</b> <b>loads,</b> including those that are not considered by regulatory documents.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{approach}} to design of the equalization procedure of bearing loads on running wheels of a load trolley. Methodological ambiguity in the trolley design issue resulting in complication of the designing process was identified. There was formed and solved the task concerning compensation of variation {{in the position of}} the common resultant of forces acting on the trolley from the point characterizing optimal load distribution between the wheels. This distribution was achieved by introducing a conventional mass and using appropriate dependencies and imposed limitations. Different options for arrangement of actual masses which form the conventional mass under the multi-purpose metal construction scheme were considered. An example on how to address the presented issue for the overhead <b>crane</b> <b>load</b> trolley was considered. The paper presents the findings of usefulness of various schemes of mass arrangement depending on a design situation.

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{developing}} control systems {{on the basis}} of dynamic virtual prototyping (DVP) has been proposed. The method facilitates the control system development process by means of (1) automating the transition from the conventional DVP of a plant to the dynamic model suitable for the control system design and (2) integrating the development process into the overall lifecycle. The method comprises the three principal stages: (1) representing the plant by its DVP; (2) simulating the DVP and generating the data-based model of the plant; (3) designing the control system using the generated data-based model. Stages 1 and 2 are supported by DVP systems (e. g. IGRIP, LMS/VirtualLab, MSC SimOffice), stage 3 is accomplished by CACSD. The proposed development method has been adapted to the class of plants that are linearizable, quasi-stationary, stable or stabilizable without using the analytical model and have lumped parameters. The specifics of applying the conventional methods of identification and control system design in the context of DVP have been revealed and analyzed. The engineering applicability of the method has been proved by means of developing the control system for fine positioning of a gantry <b>crane</b> <b>load.</b> reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Often, there occurs a {{nonlinearity}} {{so severe}} that finding a suitable conventional control method is difficult, or even impossible. Such {{is the case with}} controlling the level of Coulomb friction, as it involves a discontinuous nonlinearity. This paper emphasizes the use of fuzzy logic for such a case. A ship-mounted crane control problem is presented as a key example of this general technique. Ship mounted cranes are widely used to transfer cargo from one ship to another, particularly for military applications that often require this transfer {{to be made in the}} open sea. In the case of high sea states, the <b>crane</b> <b>load</b> is subject to large and dangerous oscillations that are excited by the ship's roll motion. A new rigging configuration is considered in order to reduce the load swing. This configuration uses friction and adjustable cable lengths to stabilize the load position. A controller is developed using fuzzy logic methods. The cable length is also adjusted in such a way that boom tip movements are counterbalanced. The resulting residual acceleration on the load is very small. Simulation results for this controller show that almost complete cancellation of the swing is achieved even in resonant conditions...|$|E
