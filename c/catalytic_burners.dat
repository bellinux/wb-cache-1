40|$|A {{catalytic}} burner (CAB) was developed, which utilizes the anode off-gas of a {{high temperature}} polymer electrolyte fuel cell (HT-PEFC). This CAB has two functions within the HT-PEFC-system: It has to convert completely all combustible components including methane and carbon monoxide, even in the low ppm range {{and it has to}} provide steam to the autothermal reformer (ATR). Thereby it increases the system’s overall efficiency. Using computational fluid dynamics and experiments with a simple glass model, two <b>catalytic</b> <b>burners</b> (CAB 2 and CAB 3) were designed and constructed for a high temperature PEFC system with thermal powers of 18 kW and 28 kW, respectively. The burners were characterized experimentally in detail. Close attention was given to the steam generation capacity and the thermal behavior. The constructed burners allowed complete conversion of low calorific fuel gases and a reformate in part load of the ATR was burned reliably as well. Superheated steam was generated free of oscillation. Experimental findings with CAB 2 resulted in an improved reactor generation with a reduced specific weight and geometric changes...|$|E
40|$|Catalytic {{combustion}} is {{an important}} area of catalysis and is used in energy production {{as well as in}} the abatement of harmful emissions of various types. This thesis is focused on three different areas of catalytic combustion: - Catalytic combustion of diesel soot - Development of catalytically active wire meshes through thermal spraying - Stabilisation and activation of g-alumina for methane combustion The first part of the thesis gives an introductory description of different aspects of catalytic combustion. This part also includes a review of different <b>catalytic</b> <b>burners</b> which have been studied during the course of the research work. Emissions of diesel soot may be trapped and combusted in a particulate trap coated with catalytically active materials. The soot particles must be combusted at temperatures prevailing in diesel exhausts, generally between 150 and 400 °C. To facilitate effective combustion at these temperatures, the particulate trap should be coated with an oxide catalyst consisting of V 2 O 5 /CuO (V:Cu= 0. 9 on molar basis). Catalytically active wire meshes offer a number of advantages over pellets and monolith catalysts. They combine geometric flexibility with excellent mass- and heat- transfer characteristics and a low pressure drop. By using a modified thermal spray technique, it is possible to produce porous adhesive ceramic coatings on metal surfaces. The specific surface area can be increased through deposition of a high-surface-area material into the macro-porosity of the as-sprayed layer. The ceramic layer is finally activated through a conventional impregnation technique. Palladium dispersed onto a Si-stabilised g-alumina is an appropriate combustion catalyst at temperatures below 1000 °C. Adding small amounts of rhodium or platinum to the palladium increases the catalyst activity but decreases the catalyst's stability to thermal deactivation. The addition of rare-earth-metal oxides will lead to increased thermal stability but to a decreased activity. Long-term deactivation tests show that the activity for combustion of methane decreases to the same extent as the value of the specific surface area, thus indicating that the alumina surface may play an important role during the activation of adsorbed methane molecules...|$|E

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on control-oriented {{analysis}} of integrated fuel cell systems that incorporate energy recuperation mechanisms. The high complexity of such fuel cell systems calls for precise control and regulation of multiple inputs. The need for robust and efficient steady state and transient operation imposes the need for intelligent control schemes. The models of two fuel cell systems are developed in this work and used {{for the design of}} feedback controllers. It is shown, through simulation, that the proposed controllers enhance the performance and meet the operating constraints. The two plants considered in this dissertation are (i) a catalytic partial oxidation fuel processor system (FPS) coupled with a proton exchange fuel cell and a <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> (CB) and (ii) a hybrid solid oxide fuel cell and gas turbine (SOFC/GT) system. Both systems rely on energy recuperation devices (ERDs), such as a <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> or a gas turbine, for achieving high fuel efficiency. Through model-based open loop analysis the FPS is shown to exhibit fuel cell H 2 starvation and reactor overheating while the SOFC/GT system is prone to shutdown during load transitions without proper feedback in place. It is identified that the transient issues can be resolved through reactant ratio control and load filtering for the FPS and the SOFC/GT systems, respectively. Using the insights from the open loop analysis, feedback control schemes are designed to address the transient issues. For the FPS, an observer-based linear controller, that utilizes temperature measurements to control the air and fuel flows into the reformer and maintain proper reactant ratios, is proposed. For the SOFC/GT system, a reference governor control scheme is developed to filter the application of the load in order to avoid GT shutdown. For both systems, the designed control schemes utilize measurements from the ERDs, such as shaft speed or <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> temperature and manage to mitigate the transient operating difficulties. Thus, the ERDs, besides increasing the steady state efficiency of the system by reducing the energy losses, also provide vital measurements for feedback control...|$|R
40|$|The <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> CAB[*] 4 was {{developed}} for a fuel-cell-based diesel-APU (auxiliary power unit) with a capacity of 14. 5 kWth,APU. In order to operate a <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> in such an APU, several requirements must be met. Normal operation involves combustion of anode off-gas from the fuel cell. If the fuel cell malfunctions or if the gas quality is insufficient, the burner must {{also be able to}} fully convert the reformate while by-passing the fuel cell. It must be possible to catalytically ignite the burner using a reformate with increased CO-concentration.

40|$|Partial {{oxidation}} (POX), catalytic {{steam reforming}} (CSR) and autothermal reforming (ATR) {{are some of}} the main processes widely used to produce hydrogen. Autothermal Reformer also defines as a steam reforming reaction and a partial oxidation reaction that take place over microscopic distances at the same catalytic site thus avoiding complex heat exchanging. The steam reforming reaction absorbs part of the heat generated by the partial oxidation process reaction, limiting the maximum temperature in the reactor. For a catalytically ignited autothermal reformer system, catalysts need to be preheated to its light- off or catalytic ignition temperature before the reactions can be self-sustained. The objective of this research is to come out with the practical method for starting-up an autothermal reformer system in the shortest possible preheating time. A <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> has been proposed to supply the required energy for pre- heating the autothermal reactor. This proposed <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> will use available hydrogen and natural gas as fuel and platinum on the honeycomb monolith surface as catalyst.

The CARS set up is shown and measurement results are discussed. The tested prototype burner {{is scheduled to}} achieve NOx emission reductions if used in power plants and therefore could contribute to the precaution of forest dieback or ozone decomposition. In {{the scope of the}} “EU project Cathlean” a real size <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> operated with natural gas was tested under atmospheric conditions. The tests were performed at the optical accessible Atmospheric Sector Combustor (ASC, diameter 500 mm) of the Institute of Propulsion Technology. Nitrogen CARS thermometry was performed at two equivalence ratios. The radial profile of mean temperature and single pulse temperature PDF´s were measured downstream the burner exit. Depending on the probe volume location bimodal temperature PDF´s were found. These were probably caused by the hot pilot lance diffusion flame and the colder premixed and pre-reacted exhaust gas downstream the catalyst. This interpretation was also supported by the OH chemiluminescence measurements, which showed a spatial and temporal variation of heat release and gave an overall impression of the flame localisation. These results were used to determine the locations for the CARS point measurements. Due to the flame symmetry the CARS measurements were restricted to one half of the combustor. Also, the results of the gas concentration measurements were consistent with the CARS results and proved the potential of the burner concept for NOx concentration reduction. Nevertheless, single pulse temperatures above 1800 K (the range for increased NOx production) were still found in the CARS temperature PDF´s. The capability of CARS to access the high and low temperature range in the same data ensemble offers a quantitative feedback information for the optimisation of burner design. Additionally, the improvement in understanding of catalytic combustion in real size combustors is supported by the two dimensional, time resolved OH chemiluminescence results and time averaged probe measurements of molecular concentrations...|$|R

In particular, a complete parametric analysis has been carried out, {{in order to assess}} the effects of the synthesis/design parameters on the local irreversibilities in the components of the stack. A finite-volume axial-symmetric model of the tubular internal reforming Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stack under investigation has been used. The stack consists of: SOFC tubes, tube-in-tube pre-reformer and tube and shell <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner.</b> The model takes into account the effects of heat/mass transfer and chemical/electrochemical reactions. The model allows one to predict the performance of a SOFC stack once a series of design and operative parameters are fixed, but also to investigate the source and localization of inefficiency. To this scope, an exergy analysis was implemented. The SOFC tube, the pre-reformer and the <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> are discretized along their longitudinal axes. Detailed models of the kinetics of the reforming, catalytic combustion and electrochemical reactions are implemented.

The heat transfer model includes the contribution of thermal radiation, so improving the models previously used by the authors. Radiative heat transfer is calculated on the basis of the slice-to-slice configuration factors and corresponding radiosities.

40|$|The task of {{this thesis}} is the {{production}} of process heat for a compact reformer at {{a low level of}} harmful substances in the flue gas. The <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> is connected with the compact reformer and a glass cleaning unit. Consequently two different kinds of running this burner are possible, first using pure methanol as a fuel and secondly a mixture of methanol and hydrogen, to which water and carbondioxide has been added. At the beginning the catalytic combustion is described and the burner concept is chosen. The catalytic combustion enables almost the total oxidation of the fuel even in case of the addition of a large amount of inert components. The selected premixing radiant <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> is very compact. It is very effective and leads to a low level of harmful substances in the flue gas. The results are, that water as an inert component does not influence the emissions of carbon-monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons, that carbondioxide added to the fuel causes only a small increase of these emissions, that a high amount of hydrogen in the fuel causes a reduction of these emissions and that with regard to these emissions an air ratio of #lambda#= 1, 1 is optimal. The nitrogen oxides remain always at a very low level. The operating temperature of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> can be reached within a time of 120 seconds. Of advantage is the preheating of the catalyst. The operating temperature is reached within a time of 80 seconds after having changed the load of the burner. It is possible to reduce the emissions of carbonmonoxide and unburned hydrocarbons in the flue gas without influencing the level of the nitrogen oxides. The reason is the low level of the combustion temperature, ranging between 400 C and 700 C. This is the most important result of this thesis. (orig.) Aufgabe dieser Arbeit ist die schadstoffarme Bereitstellung von Prozesswaerme fuer einen Kompaktreformer. Der Katalytbrenner arbeitet im Verbund mit dem Kompaktreformer und einer Gasreinigungseinheit. Daraus ergeben sich zwei unterschiedliche Betriebsarten, zum einen der Startbetrieb mit Methanol, zum anderen der Dauerbetrieb mit Methanol/Wasserstoff-Gemischen als Brennstoff unter Zugabe von Wasser und Kohlendioxid. Zu Beginn der Arbeit wird das Prinzip der katalytischen Verbrennung beschrieben und ein Verfahren ausgewaehlt, bei dem ein nahezu vollstaendiger Brennstoffumsatz auch unter Zugabe hoher Inertstoffmengen moeglich ist. Als Brennertyp wird ein vormischender Strahlungsbrenner ausgewaehlt, weil dadurch niedrige Schadstoffemissionen bei kompakter Bauform moeglich sind. Als Ergebnis wird festgestellt, dass der Inertstoff Wasser die Schadstoffemissionen von Kohlenmonoxid und Kohlenwasserstoffen nicht und der Inertstoff Kohlendioxid sie geringfuegig erhoeht, dass mit steigenden Wasserstoffanteilen im Brennstoff diese Schadstoffemissionen deutlich abnehmen und dass eine Luftzahl von #lambda#= 1, 1 optimal ist. Die Stickoxidemissionen verbleiben auf einem konstant niedrigen Niveau. Der Katalytbrenner kann innerhalb von 120 Sekunden auf Betriebstemperatur gebracht werden. Eine Katalysatorvorheizung ist dabei vorteilhaft. Ein Lastwechsel ist temperaturseitig innerhalb von 80 Sekunden moeglich. Das wichtigste Ergebnis dieser Arbeit ist, dass die Kohlenmonoxid- und Kohlenwasserstoffemissionen unabhaengig von den Stickoxidemissionen gesenkt werden koennen. Dies liegt an den niedrigen Verbrennungstemperaturen von 400 C bis 700 C. (orig.)

40|$|This work set out {{to develop}} an {{operating}} strategy for fuel processing systems combined with high-temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells (HT-PEFC). The operating strategy’s focus was to prevent the deactivation of the water-gas shift reactor’s (WGS) noble metal catalyst. The methodical approach undertaken included researching of the subject on two levels. Emphasis was placed on experimental investigation at the system and catalyst levels. This work was supplemented by model calculations. The experimental results identified high gas hourly space velocities of 45, 000 1 /h and above as a first reason for an accelerated activity drop of the catalyst. Presumably, the degradation {{was caused by a}} blockage of the active catalyst centers by reformate components or reaction intermediates like carbonates/ formates. The second reason for deactivation was incomplete fuel conversion in the autothermal reformer (ATR). Higher hydrocarbons caused side reactions on the WGS catalyst and resulted in a higher CO-concentration, as well as accelerated deactivation. The operating strategy comprises new methods to improve the fuel conversion during startup/ shutdown. With the original methods, several thousand ppmv higher hydrocarbons were observed. The new strategies reduced the concentrations up to a factor of 10 during startup and up to a factor of 400 during shutdown. Furthermore, the original catalyst A was displaced by a second catalyst B, {{which turned out to be}} much more active and stable. As a third part of the new operating strategy, regeneration methods were developed. A short-term purge (≈ 5 min) of the WGS-reactor after system shutdown with 80 lN/h air at ≈ 200 °C was enough to completely regenerate the catalyst activity. The new operating concept was validated by daily load profiles with the fuel HC-kerosene and the CO threshold value of the HT-PEFC of 1. 2 vol. -% (dry) was met. With three additional diesel fuels, validation was not possible all of the time. In future, the catalyst volume of the high-temperature shift stage (HTS) must be doubled in order to lower the gas hourly space velocity and decelerate the degradation occurring. Apart from that, catalyst B showed no indication of irreversible deterioration, even after ≈ 500 h of system operation, including 20 startup/ shutdown cycles, concentrations of higher hydrocarbons up to 3200 ppmv, as well as numerous temperature peaks of up to 763 °C. The integration of the system’s fuel cell and <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> modules into the new operating strategy is unproblematic and can take place without adjustment.

40|$|The {{reforming}} of biomass-derived oxygenates such as ethanol or glycerol {{has been}} deeply studied. However, {{the stability of}} catalyst formulations developed for glycerol reforming was not {{the main focus of}} this development work to date. In the case of propylene glycol, few studies have been addressed to date. Propylene glycol serves as coolant in many mobile applications nowadays and therefore a distribution grid already exists. The practical processing of larger amounts of polyalcohols such as propylene glycol to synthesis gas for fuel cell applications in reactors larger than laboratory scale suited for distributed applications has not been adequately addressed to date. The current work deals with (a) the development of stable catalyst formulations for propylene glycol reforming and (b) reformer and fuel processor development for the steam reforming of propylene glycol in the power range exceeding 17 kWthermal of the synthesis gas product. A self developed stable catalyst formulation was incorporated into a plate heat-exchanger reformer. The energy required to drive the endothermic steam reforming reaction was foreseen to originate from the combustion of fuel cell anode off-gas and additional propylene glycol in a future technical process. Therefore the demonstrator was composed of layers for energy supply carrying a micro-structured <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner,</b> which was fed with anode off-gas surrogate and reaction layers which carried catalyst for the oxidative steam reforming of propylene glycol. A complete integrated and compact fuel processor is under development including start-up burner and CO clean-up. It is to the authors’ knowledge the first fuel processor for steam reforming of polyalcohols of that size presented in open literature...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) have high {{potentials}} for future energy demands by converting the chemical energy of suitable fuels like hydrogen and carbon monoxide directly to electric energy and heat. To obtain an appropriate power supply, several SOFC cells are connected in series {{to form a}} SOFC stack and furthermore, multiple SOFC stacks can be combined to achieve higher power scalability up to numerous kilowatts. One major advantage of SOFC technology {{is the ability to}} use higher hydrocarbon fuels; however, additional fuel processing (i. e. partial catalytic reformer and tail gas oxidizer) is necessary. Consequently, different components interact to form a SOFC system. The modeling group at Fraunhofer IKTS is dealing with different aspects of SOFC stack and component simulation. In thi s work, an overview of our modeling strategies, partially based on homogenisation methods, for both SOFC stacks and components are given. In order to operate one or multiple SOFC stack(s) efficiently, ideal operating conditions (e. g. uniform gas supply, low thermal gradients) are of great importance. A detailed Hotbox model is presented, comprising 8 SOFC stacks, cathode flow in- and outlets. This model helps to compare different flow geometries and their influence on fuel cell performance. Additionally, heat removal can be studied. With the help of component models, the field distributions of temperature and species concentrations in the catalytic reforming- and <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> device can be analysed. The temperature distribution is also important for understanding the ageing process of the devices because high temperatures in the catalyst result in a faster performance decay of the device. The knowledge about the temperature and species distributions should enable use to optimize these components...|$|R
5000|$|In a 1971 paper, Weinberg {{first used}} the term [...] "Faustian bargain" [...] to {{describe}} nuclear energy: [...] We nuclear people have made a Faustian bargain with society. On the one hand we offer—in the <b>catalytic</b> nuclear <b>burner</b> (i.e., the breeder)—an inexhaustible source of energy. Even in the short range, when we use ordinary reactors, we offer energy that is cheaper than energy from fossil fuel. Moreover, this source of energy when properly handled is almost nonpolluting. Whereas fossil-fuel burners emit oxides of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur... there is no intrinsic reason why nuclear systems must emit any pollutant except heat and traces of radioactivity.But the price that we demand of society for this magical source is both a vigilance from and longevity of our social institutionsthat we are quite unaccustomed to.|$|R
40|$|The {{slip casting}} studies on well {{optimised}} slips of Sic, Si 3 N 4 and silicon {{have been applied}} to fabricate some components with complicated shapes eg. after <b>burner</b> <b>catalytic</b> ignitor housings, super charger stator rings etc. The green densities of slip cast bodies of Sic, Si 3 N 4 and silicon slips ranges from 50 to 60 of theoretical value, indicating that good compacts {{can be obtained by}} the slip casting procedure by using these optimised slips...|$|R
40|$|In the future, {{drive systems}} for {{vehicles}} with polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) {{may be the}} environmentally more acceptable alternative to conventional drives with internal combustion engines. The energy carrier may not: be gasoline or diesel, as in combustion engines today, but methanol, which is converted on-board into a hydrogen-rich synthesis gas in a reforming reaction with water. After removal of carbon monoxide in a gas-cleaning step, the conditioned synthesis gas is converted into electricity in a fuel cell using air as the oxidant. The electric energy thus generated serves to supply a vehicle's electric drive system. Based on the process design for a test drive system, a test facility was prepared and assembled at Forschungszentrum Julich (FZJ). Final function tests with the PEMFC and the integrated compact methanol reformer (CMR) were carried out to determine the performance and the dynamic behaviour. With regard to the 50 -kW(H- 2,) -compact methanol reformer, a special design of <b>catalytic</b> <b>burner</b> was constructed. The burner units, with a total power output of 16 kW, were built and tested under different stales of constant and alternating load. If selecting a specific catalyst loading of 40 g Pt/m(2), the burner emissions are below the super ultra low emission vehicle (SULEV) standard. The stationary performance test of the CMR shows a specific hydrogen production of 6. 7 m(N) (3) /(kg(cat) h) for a methanol conversion rate of 95 % at 280 degrees C. Measurements of the transient behaviour of the CMR. clearly show a response time of about 20 s, reaching 99 % of the hydrogen flow demand due to the Limited performance of the test facility control system. Simulations {{have been carried out}} in order to develop a control strategy far hydrogen production by the CMR during the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Based on the NEDC, an optimized energy management for the total drive system was evaluated and the characteristic data for different peak load storage systems ate described.

40|$|A {{water heater}} has a gas inlet (8) for a {{combustible}} gas and air mixture and an inlet for a fluid {{to be heated}} (11, 18) which is partially surrounded {{by at least one}} fluid chamber (4, 7) filled with the fluid (2). The exhaust gas emerging from the combustion chamber or chambers (11, 18) flows through the exhaust heat exchanger together with the fluid (2). Thereby, there are two combustion stages, whereby the first combustion stage (16) is a <b>catalytic</b> splitting <b>burner</b> (11) and the second combustion stage (20) is a monolithic burner (18, 19). As a result of the two- stage arrangement, about 80 percent of the combustible gas is converted in the first stage (16), whereby the remaining combustible gas components are themselves converted practically without any residue at the prevailing low partial pressures in the second stage (20), in particular without NO<-x emissions...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{describes the}} investigation of an engine-scale <b>catalytic</b> hybrid <b>burner.</b> The burner has been investigated under atmospheric conditions with preheated air and natural gas fuel in two operating points, with and without the catalytic reactor. By using the catalyst, {{an extension of the}} operating range to leaner stoichiometries has been demonstrated. Exhaust gas analysis performed directly downstream of the burner {{as well as in the}} burner far-field showed a NOx reduction potential of more than 20 % when employing the catalyst. For the operation with the catalytic reactor, the flame stabilization process and dependency of NOx formation on the piloting gas ratio is described with results of OH chemiluminescence measurements. Radial temperature profiles taken with Coherent Anti Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) suggest a reaction delay directly downstream of the catalytic section of the burner. Calculations with a perfectly stirred reactor model help to obtain a better understanding of the kinetics of the hot gases leaving the catalyst section...|$|R
