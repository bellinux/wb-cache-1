30|$|Mirror <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> Jianli (Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus) were {{cultivated}} at Experimental Station of the Wuxi Freshwater Center, Jiangsu, China. The {{mirror carp}} was derived by domesticating the common <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> selecting for a scale-reduced mutation fgfr 1 a (Rohner et al. 2009). The skin tissues from mirror <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> Jianli were harvested with forceps and immediately homogenized in 1 ml Trizol (Invitrogen).|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we report}} the {{complete}} mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of the allotetraploid <b>and</b> triploid crucian <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> compare the complete mtDNA sequences between the triploid crucian <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> its female parent Japanese crucian <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> between the triploid crucian <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> its male parent allotetraploid. Our {{results indicate that}} the complete mtDNA nucleotide identity (98 %) between the triploid crucian <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> its male parent allotetraploid was higher than that (93 %) between the triploid crucian <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> its female parent Japanese crucian carp. Moreover, the presence of a pattern of identity and difference at synonymous sites of mitochondrial genomes between the triploid crucian <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> its parents provides direct evidence that triploid crucian carp possessed the recombination mtDNA fragment (12, 759 bp) derived from the paternal fish. These results suggest that mtDNA recombination was derived from the fusion of the maternal and paternal mtDNAs. Compared with the haploid egg with one set of genome from the Japanese crucian carp, the diploid sperm with two sets of genomes from the allotetraploid could more easily make its mtDNA fuse with the mtDNA of the haploid egg. In addition, the triple hybrid nature of the triploid crucian carp probably allowed its better mtDNA recombination. In summary, our results provide the first evidence of mtDNA combination in polyploid fish...|$|R

Four species of fishes such as silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), mrigal (Cirrhina cirrhosus), catla (Catla catla) <b>and</b> common <b>carp</b> (Cyprinus carpio) were cultured in four different combinations each containing two species. The combination of silver <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> mrigal in treatment 1, <b>and</b> silver <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> common <b>carp</b> in treatment 2 resulted better growth and production than other two treatments of different combinations of catla <b>and</b> common <b>carp,</b> <b>and</b> catla and mrigal...|$|R

40|$|A 2 -year {{investigation}} {{of growth and}} food availability of silver <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> bighead was carried out using stable isotope and gut content analysis in a large pen in Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu, China. Both silver <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> bighead exhibited significantly higher delta 13 C in 2005 than in 2004, which can probably be attributed to two factors: (i) the difference between isotopic compositions {{at the base of}} the pelagic food web and (ii) the difference between the compositions of prey items and stable isotopes. The significantly positive correlations between body length, body weight and stable isotope ratios indicated that isotopic changes in silver <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> bighead resulted from the accumulation of biomass concomitant with rapid growth. Because of the drastic decrease in zooplankton in the diet in 2005, silver <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> bighead grew faster in 2004 than in 2005. Bighead carp showed a lower trophic level than silver carp in 2005 as indicated by stable nitrogen isotope ratios, which was possibly explained by the interspecific difference between the prey species and the food quality of silver <b>carp</b> <b>and</b> bighead...|$|R
