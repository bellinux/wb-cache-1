The deep chancel was remodelled in 1912–1914 with new organ, pulpit and communion table.|$|E
25|$|Plaques are {{a special}} {{feature in the}} temple complex, which depict jataka tales; each plaque made of glazed Terra-cotta tiles {{representing}} one story of the jataka. Plethora of plaques is seen on the temple walls and terraces (five numbers). These are: {{at the base of}} the structure extending, from south to west, there are 552 images of Mara’s marching warriors intending to attack Buddha, and also a procession of gods; west to the north entrance warriors are shown vanquished by supernatural powers of Buddha; southwest <b>comer</b> <b>of</b> the first terrace to the northern side of the third terrace display 537 plaques, each related to a specific story from Jataka tales; on the northern side of the second terrace up to the fifth terrace depictions are from Tey Mi Jataka; the fifth terrace depicts 547 plaques of stories of Vessantara Jataka in two parts, 537 plaques in the first tier and the second set above the first tier on the roof depict 375 plaques of the last ten jatakas, the Mahanipata; the last ten lives of the Buddha are depicted in plaques of green colour. There are depictions of camels on the plaques, suggesting the influence of trade routes on the region.|$|E

The designs called for a self-sufficient [...] "maximum security storage area for the most advanced weapons of mankind". The mission of the facility would be the protection and maintenance of the weapons used by SAC. The facility was in the northeast <b>comer</b> <b>of</b> the base, and construction began on 4 August 1951. In addition to 28 storage igloos and other weapons storage structures, the facility included weapons maintenance buildings, barracks, recreational facilities, a warehouse, and offices.|$|E

500|$|Andrea <b>Comer</b> <b>of</b> The Hartford Courant {{felt that}} OutKast's [...] "lyrical acumen shines through" [...] despite [...] "Heltah-Skeltah mumbling and Southern slang", and stated, [...] "after a few rotations, the alien feeling wears away, and [...] {{just out of}} this world." [...] Sonia Murray of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called the album [...] "more thoughtful" [...] than its predecessor, noting, [...] "What the second album lacks in adventurous {{arrangements}} it more than makes up for in lyrical dominance." [...] The Source observed [...] "growth" [...] from OutKast and Organized Noize, and stated, [...] "Big Boi and Dre {{have gone out of}} this world into a new dimension of sight, sound and mind".|$|E
500|$|Two-thirds of {{the album}} is {{produced}} by Organized Noize, OutKast's primary production team. The rest is produced by Earthtone III, a production team that includes OutKast themselves and Mr. DJ. [...] André 3000 and Big Boi produced the songs [...] "Jazzy Belle" [...] and [...] "Elevators (Me & You)". It also has a notably more laid-back, spacey production sound, which they expanded upon on their follow-up album Aquemini. [...] Although the group drew from George Clinton's outer-space inspired compositions, the band utilizes a more laid-back style as opposed to Clinton's hard funk leanings. Many tracks feature strong echo and reverb, taking influence from dub and reggae. [...] Andrea <b>Comer</b> <b>of</b> The Hartford Courant perceives an [...] "extraterrestrial feel" [...] in the record's production.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{predominant}} synthetic attributes {{and the overall}} electronic aesthetic, the emphasis placed on organic string arrangements that had accentuated Late Registration remained a significant factor on Graduation. Similar to its predecessor, Graduation wasn't restricted to the confines of conventional looping techniques typical of traditional hip-hop production. Instead, West continues to implement sudden musical shifts within the multi-layered song structures and express meticulously composed introductions, bridges, and codas. For his third album, West produced songs that combine hip-hop beats with anthemic refrains and continues to employ his skill in layering keys, strings, and vocals to coax the melodies out of samples. According to Sean <b>Comer</b> <b>of</b> 411Mania, Graduation is an ambitious album that demonstrates West's attentive ear to the blending of structure, melody, timing, evocative arrangement and their potential to rest comfortably alongside effective samples. Through acting as his own producer, West manages to maintain quality control over the album's music to ensure that [...] "his productions build momentum even when they revolve around a handful of repeated samples [...] nearly every song on Graduation is memorable for both its hooks and its overall sound." [...] And as the album progresses, its textures and the glossy sheen of its polished, synthesizer-driven productions become harder and denser with every track. Under the belief that his sophomore effort had been far too indulgent, poorly arranged, and oversaturated with unnecessary sonic accoutrements, West took measures to streamline his third release. West fashioned Graduation to contain less ornate production, made the studio album completely devoid of hip-hop skits, and sequenced the record {{in such a way}} that it produced a tighter, more cohesive package.|$|E
