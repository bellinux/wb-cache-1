This technique was extensively {{used in the}} XIXth and early XXth centuries in Europe for agriculture and development of transport networks. Although widespread, drystone structures remain largely unknown, and consequently, there are relatively few new constructions or even reconstructions of ancient structures in drystone. Over the past two decades, research studies in France and in the UK have been dedicated {{to a better understanding}} of the behaviour of drystone retaining walls.
