5|$|I've had to {{deal with}} some hard truths... People don't like to hear we've got only 18 percent of the electorate. They pretend it's not {{important}} that our following among blacks, and young people, and urban <b>communities</b> <b>is</b> not what it should be... But I feel it's of the greatest importance that if there's to be a Republican Party, we look these facts in the face.|$|E
5|$|The Region of Île de France, {{including}} Paris and {{its surrounding}} <b>communities,</b> <b>is</b> governed by the Regional Council, which has its headquarters in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. It is composed of 209 members representing the different communes within the region. On December 15, 2015, a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Valérie Pécresse, narrowly won the regional election, defeating a coalition of Socialists and ecologists. The Socialists had governed the region for seventeen years. The regional council has 121 members from the Union of the Right, 66 from the Union of the Left and 22 from the extreme right National Front.|$|E

Common {{among them are}} the pine warbler (Dendroica pinus), the red-bellied {{woodpecker}} (Melanerpes carolinus), and the eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna). More than 20species of reptiles and amphibians have been noted, such as the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala), and southern black racer (Coluber constrictor priapus). Mammals such as the critically endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi), American black bearFlorida black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus), and several types of bats also live in the pine rocklands.|$|E

The majority moved to Canada, while others went to the United States, Australia, Taiwan, Austria and Sweden. The predominant dialect of Hakka in these <b>communities</b> <b>is</b> Meixian.|$|E
40|$|Within China six Early Viséan rugose coral <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> recognized, {{they are}} : 1) the Siphonophyllia {{community}}, 2) the cool water Gangamophyllum community, 3) the Thysanophyllum community, 4) the Bothrophyllum-Zaphrentites community, 5) the island Humboldtia community and 6) {{the cold water}} Hapsiphyllum-Rhopalolasma community. In northwest China, the Siphonophyllia <b>community</b> <b>is</b> distributed along the northern margin of the Tarim-Qaidam Oldland. The Gangamophyllum <b>community</b> <b>was</b> widespread north of the region occupied by the Siphonophyllia community, including north Tianshan, central Tianshan and east Junggar. In South China there were three rugose coral communities. The Thysanophyllum community occurs on {{the margin of the}} Upper Yangtze Oldland. The Bothrophyllum-Zaphrentites <b>community</b> <b>was</b> confined to the southern and western part of the region occupied by the Thysanophyllum community. These two communities merge into each other without a distinct boundary. The Humboldtia <b>community</b> <b>is</b> found only in the Baoshan area. The Hapsiphyllum-Rhopalolasma <b>community</b> <b>is</b> found in Xainza and Himalaya of Tibet. The distribution of the six Early Viséan rugose coral <b>communities</b> <b>was</b> controlled by the palaeogeographical background. The Gangamophyllum community occurs along the southern margin of the Siberia Oldland, while the Siphonophyllia <b>community</b> <b>is</b> distributed along the northern margin of Tarim-Qaidam Oldland. The Hapsiphyllum-Rhopalolasma <b>community</b> <b>is</b> confined to the northern margin of the Gondwana Oldland. In the wide southern and western margin of Yangtze Oldland the distribution of the Thysanophyllum and the Bothrophyllum-Zaphrentites <b>communities</b> <b>was</b> controlled by the bathymetry. The Humboldtia community probably lived in island seas far from the Yangtze Oldland...|$|R

25|$|The {{history of}} Christianity in Hungary {{began in the}} Roman {{province}} of Pannonia where the presence of Christian <b>communities</b> <b>is</b> first attested in the 3rdcentury. Although the territory was under the successive control of the Huns, Germanic peoples, and Avars from the 5thcentury, Christian communities may have survived {{in the region of}} Lake Balaton up until the 9thcentury. Accordingly, Christianity had existed in the present-day territory of Hungary before the Hungarians settled there around 900AD, but the question of continuity is unresolved.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{election}} of bishops in other early Christian <b>communities</b> <b>is</b> often described in contemporary sources, the earliest Roman sources date from 400, claiming that Peter himself appointed Linus, Anacletus, and Clement—in that order—as his successors. The early official lists of Bishops of Rome are considered problematic by scholars because of their bias towards enhancing papal authority and anachronistically imposing continuity; for example, the earliest, the Liber Pontificalis, dating probably from 354, is notoriously unreliable {{for the first two}} centuries.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{living in}} this zone have a highly {{variable}} and often hostile environment, and have evolved various adaptations to cope with and even exploit these conditions. One easily visible feature of intertidal <b>communities</b> <b>is</b> vertical zonation, where the community is divided into distinct vertical bands of specific species going up the shore. Species {{ability to cope with}} abiotic factors associated with emersion stress, such as desiccation determines their upper limits, while biotic interactions e.g.competition with other species sets their lower limits.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, the Blue Cross Foundation {{found that}} there are four types of <b>communities</b> that can <b>be</b> {{identified}} based on their risk of uninsurance: entrenched-risk, unexpected-risk, resilient, and low-risk. Entrenched-risk <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> <b>communities</b> that have {{a high concentration of}} foreign-born denizens, and therefore {{are less likely to be}} eligible for Medicare. Unexpected-risk communities have high uninsurance but were not expected to based on their geographical locations, like Cape Cod or Boston. Resilient <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> <b>communities</b> that <b>were</b> expected to have high uninsurance but did not, like Worcester and north and south of Boston. Finally, low-risk <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> <b>communities</b> <b>are</b> <b>communities</b> that have high rate of insurance and were expected to have high rates of insurance based on their characteristics.|$|R
25|$|Although {{commonly}} {{described as}} a language, Zapotec is a fairly extensive, if close-knit, language family. The time depth is {{comparable to that of}} the Romance languages. Dialectal divergence between Zapotec-speaking <b>communities</b> <b>is</b> extensive and complicated. Many varieties of Zapotec are mutually unintelligible with one other. There are some radical jumps in intelligibility between geographically close communities, so the varieties do not form a dialect continuum in a strict sense, though neither are there clear-cut divisions between groups of varieties. As a result, the Mexican government officially recognizes sixty Zapotec languages.|$|E
25|$|Major roadways {{include the}} north-south Memorial Drive, {{located on the}} western edge of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial and {{parallel}} to Interstate 70, the north-south streets of Grand Boulevard and Jefferson Avenue, both of which run the length of the city, and Gravois Road, which runs from the southeastern portion of the city to downtown and used to be signed as U.S. Route 66. An east-west roadway that connects the city with surrounding <b>communities</b> <b>is</b> Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive, which carries traffic from {{the western edge of}} the city to downtown.|$|E
25|$|Education in primary-schools serving Xhosa-speaking <b>communities</b> <b>is</b> {{conducted}} in isiXhosa, {{but this is}} replaced by English after the early primary grades. Xhosa is still considered as a studied subject, however, {{and it is possible}} to major in Xhosa at university level. Most of the students at Walter Sisulu University and University of Fort Hare speak isiXhosa. Rhodes University in Grahamstown, additionally, offers courses in isiXhosa for both mother-tongue and non-mother-tongue speakers. These courses both include a cultural studies component. Professor Russel H. Kaschula, Head of the School of Languages at Rhodes, has published multiple papers on Xhosa culture and oral literature.|$|E
