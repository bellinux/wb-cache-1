50|$|An IMF {{working paper}} on Expansionary Austerity and the Expansionary Fiscal Contraction {{hypothesis}} that examined changes in policy {{designed to reduce}} deficits found that austerity had <b>contractionary</b> <b>effects</b> on private domestic demand and GDP. This report concluded that other studies appeared biased to overstating the expansionary effects of austerity.|$|E
50|$|Emerging {{countries}} {{and developing countries}} often have a larger part of their debt in foreign currencies {{and in that case}} expansionary monetary policy can actually have <b>contractionary</b> <b>effects</b> because the net worth of banks may fall. As a result, less funds will be available and investment will fall, and so will aggregate expenditure. Depreciation in emerging markets, when acting contractionary, are dangerous because they can trigger a financial crisis.|$|E
30|$|Turning to Mexico, {{several studies}} have {{provided}} conflicting evidence on the RER’s growth effects. For aggregate output, studies finding <b>contractionary</b> <b>effects</b> include Kamin and Rogers (1997), Garcés (2008), and López et al. (2011); Galindo and Ros (2008), in contrast, show expansionary long-run effects. For aggregate investment, Caballero and Lopez (2012) find <b>contractionary</b> <b>effects,</b> while Ibarra (2010, 2015) shows the opposite ones. In an intermediate position, Blecker (2009) found a negative direct effect on the investment rate, which however was mostly offset by a positive indirect effect operating through the output growth rate. While the <b>contractionary</b> <b>effects</b> are typically motivated by the rising costs of imported inputs and higher payments of dollar-denominated debt—factors that may be particularly relevant for firms in the non-tradables sector—the expansionary ones are attributed to greater profit margins in the tradables sector, or alternatively to a relaxation of the external constraint on growth thanks to greater price competitiveness. But {{with the exception of}} Galindo and Ros (2008), who show the existence of <b>contractionary</b> <b>effects</b> in separate short-run equations, none of these studies applied a methodology to detect possible asymmetries.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the dynamic effects of five different fiscal shocks on the US economy using a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model that uses Blanchard-Quah type restrictions. We find that {{an increase in}} indirect taxes or in corporate taxes has a <b>contractionary</b> <b>effect</b> on the economy, while an increase in personal taxes is neither contractionary, nor expansionary. These results imply that the Ricardian Equivalence hypothesis holds only for personal taxes. On the spending side, we find that an increase in government wages and salaries has a <b>contractionary</b> <b>effect</b> on the economy, while an increase in defense spending is expansionary. Our results suggest that different fiscal shocks have different and offsetting effects on the economy, and using aggregated data may, therefore, conceal the effects of fiscal policy. ...|$|R
30|$|The estimations in {{the paper}} also {{uncovered}} the existence of dynamic asymmetries. Indeed, while a depreciation increases the aggregate level of investment in the long run, it decreases it in the short run, in a <b>contractionary</b> <b>effect</b> that may last for several quarters. This dynamic asymmetry contributes to reconciling the apparently contradictory results reached by previous studies that show either contractionary or expansionary RER effects on economic activity in Mexico.|$|R
40|$|Analyses of the {{possible}} <b>contractionary</b> <b>effects</b> of exchange rate devaluation typically assume the foreign exchange market to be unified, thereby ignoring the large fraction of transactions {{taking place in the}} black market for foreign exchange that exist in many developing countries. This paper explores how the existence of these black markets may alter the impact of an official devaluation on aggregate output. It is argued that devaluations will be followed by less immediate contraction in a black­market economy than in a unified-market economy, both because the black market exchange rate will depreciate by less than the official rate, and because many of the devaluation's <b>contractionary</b> <b>effects</b> will occur in anticipation of the official devaluation itself. These propositions are tested using a simple numerical simulation model. Foreign exchange rates...|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, after an {{appreciation}} the effect on investment may increase gradually in absolute terms, but it is always negative. After a depreciation, in contrast, the effect eventually switches sign: it begins negative, but after several quarters it becomes positive. In other words, while appreciations have consistently negative effects on investment, depreciations have <b>contractionary</b> <b>effects</b> {{in the short run}} but expansionary ones in the long run.|$|E

40|$|To update {{a famous}} old statistic: a {{political}} leader in a developing country is almost {{twice as likely to}} lose office in the 6 months following a currency crash as otherwise. This difference, which is highly significant statistically, holds regardless whether the devaluation takes place {{in the context of an}} IMF program. Why are devaluations so costly? Many of the currency crises of the last ten years have been associated with output loss. Is this, as alleged, because of excessive reliance on raising the interest rate as a policy response? More likely it is because of <b>contractionary</b> <b>effects</b> of devaluation. There are various possible <b>contractionary</b> <b>effects</b> of devaluation, but it is appropriate that the balance sheet effect receives the most emphasis. Passthrough from exchange rate changes to import prices in developing countries is not the problem: this coefficient fell in the 1990 s, as a look at some narrowly defined products shows.

40|$|The {{effect on}} {{investment}} of temporary tax rate changes {{depends on the}} age profile of depreciation deduct ions. If the depreciation allowance schedule is accelerated, then temporary cuts in the corporate tax rate could reduce investment.

Two currently proposed reforms are shown to exacerbate this effect. Under these proposals, temporary tax cuts {{are likely to have}} opposite effects on investment in short-lived and long-lived capital, thereby complicating the conduct of countercyclical fiscal policy. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an Open Economy Financial Accelerator model {{along the lines of}} Greenwald-Stiglitz (1993) close in spirit but {{different}} in many respects from the one proposed by Greenwald (1998.) The first goal of the paper is to provide a taxonomy of the effects of a devaluation in this context. The direct (first round) effect on output, taking as given net worth and interest rate, is negative for domestic firms (due to the input cost effect) and positive for exporting firms (due to a positive foreign debt effect). The indirect (second round) wealth effect (on output through net worth, taking as given the interest rate) is uncertain, depending on the relative size of the domestic and exporting firms. There is also an indirect effect on output through the response of the domestic interest rate to a devaluation due to the risk premium effect. Due to the uncertainty on the sign of most of these effects, it is difficult to assess the overall impact of a devaluation. One cannot rule out, however, an economy-wide <b>contractionary</b> <b>effect</b> of a devaluation. If the devaluation affects negatively the net worth of domestic firms, the domestic interest rate may rise (due to the risk premium effect), exerting an additional contractionary impact on output. If, on top of that, the monetary authorities force a further increase of the interest rate in an effort to curb the exchange rate, the <b>contractionary</b> <b>effect</b> will be emphasized. ...|$|R

These findings lend support to recent theoretical contributions on the interaction between uncertainty shocks and the stance of monetary policy. Open Acces...|$|E
