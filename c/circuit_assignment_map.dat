Therefore, dedicated hardware for evolutionary, neural and fuzzy computation is a key issue for designers. With the spread of reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs, digital as well as analog hardware implementations of such computation become cost-effective.  The idea behind this book is to offer a variety of hardware designs for soft computing techniques that can be embedded in any final product. Also, to introduce the successful application of soft computing technique to solve many hard problem encountered during the design of embedded hardware designs. Reconfigurable embedded designs for GAs, ANNs, FCs and PSO are presented and evaluated.

The motivation {{stems from the}} very important property that degenerate feedback gains {{may be used for}} the linearisation of the pole <b>assignment</b> <b>map</b> and enable frequency assignment.

The paper reviews the Global Asymptotic Linearisation method associated with the core versions of determinantal pole assignment problems and defines the conditions which characterises degenerate solutions of different types.

While convergent and correct message-passing algorithms represent a step forward in the analysis of max-product style message-passing algorithms, the conditions needed to guarantee convergence to a global optimum can be too restrictive in both theory and practice.
