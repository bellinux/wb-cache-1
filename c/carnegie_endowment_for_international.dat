Next to the Peace Palace building the Academy’s facilities include the Academy Hall built <b>for</b> <b>international</b> conferences, the Peace Palace Library {{as well as}} further administrative accommodations. The new buildings were planned and realized by architects Michael Wilford and Manuel Schupp.Alongside The Hague Academy of International Law the Peace Palace houses highest judicial {{institutions such as the}} International Court of Justice and the Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. In the context of the movement for the establishment of peace through law, the idea of creating an Academy of International Law was mooted at the Hague Conference in 1907 (having previously been voiced by the Institut de Droit International as early as 1873). The Dutch Government took up the idea, and the International Law Association in turn examined the question. The Dutch Lawyer Tobias M. C. Asser proposed a plan that envisaged more or less what the Academy was to become, with courses held from July to October. Asser received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1911 and contributed a part of the prize money to the Academy; and the <b>Carnegie</b> <b>Endowment</b> <b>for</b> Peace provided a valuable contribution to get it started. The inauguration of the Academy was planned for October 1914. But World War I broke out, and preparations could not be resumed until 1921.
