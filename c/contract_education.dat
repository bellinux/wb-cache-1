40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Community {{colleges are}} being {{pressured}} {{to increase their}} direct support of the economic development agendas of their communities, their states, and even the nation. These pressures develop both externally and internally, and are exacerbated when increased demands for access to community college education must be met with chronically flat-lined or underfunded community college budgets. In order {{to deal effectively with}} these pressures, community colleges may have to increase the considerable degree to which they already collaborate with the private interests within their communities. <b>Contract</b> <b>education</b> programs are one of the more powerful collaborative devices available to community colleges. But increasing their emphasis on <b>contract</b> <b>education</b> presents practical and philosophical issues for community colleges, and may even put their traditionally comprehensive missions at risk. This study suggests that {{the degree to which a}} community college is able to resolve those issues and maintain a comprehensive mission is heavily dependent upon the ability of the top leadership to balance the values and interests of the multiple organizational cultures that make up the community college and its immediate environment...|$|E

40|$|We {{hear about}} the {{so-called}} “War on Women” and persisting salary gaps {{between men and women}} in the popular media, but contracts scholars and policymakers rarely discuss gender. Instead, dominant voices in the contracts field often reflect classical and economics-driven theories built on assumptions of gender neutral and economically rational actors. Furthermore, many mistakenly assume that market competition and antidiscrimination legislation address any improper biases in contracting. This Article therefore aims to shed light on gender’s importance by distilling data from my own e-survey of Colorado consumers along with others’ research regarding gender differences in contract outcomes, interests and behaviors. In light of this research, the Article calls for open discussion of gender in contract and consumer law. It also suggests ideas for considering research findings and the importance of context in designing financial literacy and <b>contract</b> <b>education</b> programs that acknowledge gender while honoring individuality and avoiding stereotype reinforcement...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines {{the costs and}} benefits associated with the three courses of action the Marine Corps has used to provide initial <b>contracting</b> training and <b>education</b> to unrestricted Marine officers. The Marine Corps' contracting officer inventory is limited because it does not require Marines to execute multiple contracting tours. I analyzed which course of action would yield the biggest return to the Marine Corps while strengthening the Marine Corps' contracting officer workforce. All three courses of action analyzed allow the Marine to obtain an advanced degree, complete professional military education for his or her grade, and complete the Defense Acquisitions Workforce Improvement Act Level III <b>contracting</b> <b>education</b> required for career field certification. The research shows that the best model to provide initial <b>contracting</b> training and <b>education</b> to Marine unrestricted officers is to use the Contingency Contracting Officer Course or the Defense Acquisition University. After the officer's initial contracting tour, the Marine Corps should use the Naval Postgraduate School as a retention tool to ensure the Marine will execute at least a second contracting tour. After the second contracting tour, the Marine should have the opportunity to make a lateral move into the contracting career field to become the Marine's primary military occupational specialty.

The secondary outcome was attitudes about antibiotic use evaluated on day 14 and at month 6. Of the 300 randomized children, 150 per arm, 259 were evaluated on day 14. Parent satisfaction with information on antibiotics was higher in the intervention group (125 / 129, 96. 9 %, versus 108 / 130, 83. 0 %; P= 0. 002, exact Fisher test). Group parents had higher proportions of correct answers on day 14 to questions on attitudes about judicious antibiotic use than did control-group parents (P= 0. 017, Mann-Whitney U test). Therapeutic education delivered by a clinical pharmacist in the pediatric emergency department holds promise for improving the use of antibiotics prescribed to pediatric outpatients.

40|$|Nobody  {{questions}} that signing a national educational contract {{is essential for}} our country and a long-time demand of Spanish society. The king of Spain himself, in his last years' Christmas Speech was very explicit about it: "Its urgent, as I have emphasized for some time now, to sign a great <b>contract</b> on <b>Education,</b> and do it today better than tomorrow". It is very difficult, though. There are many vested interests at stake and teachers' opinions are rather pessimistic about reaching an agreement that they regard as necessary but improbable.

40|$|Education sectors {{the world}} over are facing a number of social, {{economic}} and policy challenges. Governments have responded – to varying degrees – to these challenges by introducing market-based policies that emphasize choice, managerial autonomy for schools and accountability for results. Contracting {{with the private sector}} for the delivery of ancillary services such as catering and school transport is relatively common in the education sector. A more recent trend has seen governments contracting with the private sector for the delivery of core education services. While such contracting is not widespread, {{there are a number of}} examples in operation in the United States and around the world. This paper provides an overview of international examples of contracting with the private sector for the delivery of educational services, professional services and the provision of educational infrastructure. It also draws a number of tentative lessons from this international experience for the design and implementation of <b>contracting</b> in the <b>education</b> sector. A key conclusion is that there is little hard evidence available on the success or otherwise of <b>contracting</b> in <b>education.</b> Further research is required to determine the educational and other impacts of <b>contracting</b> in <b>education...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Swedish Centre for Nuclear Technology (Svenskt Kärntekniskt Centrum, SKC) is a {{national}} initiative to perform industry relevant research at Swedish universities, and to support dedicated education of direct use to the Swedish nuclear industry. SKC has been the meeting point between industry and academia for 25 years, and has coped with varying needs from industry and political situations. The present situation in the Nordic countries is split: Sweden plans to shut down four out of ten reactors by 2020, while Finland is planning and constructing new reactors. Even without a strong signal to construct new reactors in Sweden, the need for nuclear competence will stay, as we have challenges {{in front of us}} to operate and dismantle power plants, operate the intermediate storage facility CLAB in Oskarshamn, and to build and fill the final repositories in Forsmark. The education supported by the SKC at the selected universities will facilitate possible recruitment for nuclear installations. The funding body of SKC consists of all the Swedish Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) situated in Forsmark (three BWRs), Oskarshamn (three BWRs) and Ringhals (one BWR and three PWRs), and the nuclear fuel manufacturer (Westinghouse), while the main research and education is carried out at Chalmers, KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Uppsala University with corresponding in-kind contribution. The research activities cover highly requested studies for today’s nuclear fleet: material embrittlement, stress-corrosion cracking, accident-tolerant fuel development and ageing management for long-term operation (LTO), while the educational part consists of Bachelor and Master programmes as well as elective courses for students outside the main nuclear programmes and <b>contract</b> <b>education.</b> In the master programmes, focus is on e-learning platforms for courses and examination. Examples from such development are to be presented in the full contribution to the conference. Another success story is project based courses in industry, especially within the Bachelor programmes. This is highly appreciated by students, providing a direct contact with future employers, The success of SKC originates from close contact between the funding bodies and academia on many levels: base funding for course preparation, project support in annual calls, and dedicated long-term research funding. But also dedicated industrial experts, and an enthusiasm from academia to enlighten present research issues, as well as strong presence at universities during student fairs and career days.

40|$|The palaeontological site of Somosaguas {{is located}} in Pozuelo de Alarcón, {{to the west of}} the city of Madrid (Spain), and {{contains}} fossils of Miocene age corresponding to 24 species of micro- and macromammals as well as other vertebrates. The Somosaguas Palaeontology Project is focused on this site and was coordinated by Nieves López Martínez between 1998 and 2010 as an example of management of a palaeontological site by university students and young researchers. This project began with fi eld seasons for students in natural sciences grades and today is a multidisciplinary project open to students from any university degree. The signifi cance of the investigations around this fossil site is refl ected in a large number of papers published in national and international journals. Additionaly, there are numerous outreach activities in geology and palaeontology with special attention to what we call Social Palaeontology. Finally, this project has a strong commitment to educational innovation in both non-formal (during school visits, open days at the site and science fairs) and formal university education, with the establishment of an introduction to investigation group in order to prepare young researchers in different fi elds of geology, palaeontology and education. This work is in memory of Nieves López Martínez, who allowed a group of young researchers to undertake the management of a unique project in a vertebrate site and that every day covers more areas in the scientific and educational outreach. The authors wish to thank all students and researchers who have collaborated during all these years in the Somosaguas Palaeontology Project; their work has allowed this project to grow more and more every year. The quality of this manuscript improved thanks to the insightful reviews of Laura Domingo Martínez and Juán López Cantalapiedra.
