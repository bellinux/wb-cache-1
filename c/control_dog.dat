40|$|Serum {{electrolytes}} {{were measured}} before and sequentially for 3 hours after resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation in a canine model {{that was designed}} to approximate the human cardiac arrest and resuscitation process. Twenty anesthetized dogs were resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation; 7 required epinephrine during resuscitation and 13 did not. To control for the effects of anesthesia, 10 dogs were anesthetized and instrumented, but ventricular fibrillation was not induced. Serum potassium decreased from 3. 7 ± 0. 3 mmol/liter at baseline to 3. 2 ± 0. 4 mmol/liter 45 minutes after resuscitation in the experimental dogs resuscitated without epinephrine, as compared with 3. 6 ± 0. 3 to 3. 4 ± 0. 2 mmol/liter in <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> (p = 0. 07 versus <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> by two-way analysis of variance) and returned toward baseline at the end of 3 hours. Serum calcium decreased from 9. 6 ± 0. 6 mg/dl at baseline to 8. 9 ± 0. 9 mg/dl at 5 minutes after resuscitation as compared with 9. 4 ± 0. 7 to 9. 5 ± 0. 7 mg/dl in <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> (p < 0. 05 versus <b>control</b> <b>dogs)</b> and returned to baseline by 3 hours. Serum magnesium decreased from 1. 5 ± 0. 1 to 1. 3 ± 0. 2 mEq/dl by 3 hours in resuscitated dogs as compared with 1. 6 ± 0. 2 to 1. 5 ± 0. 2 mEq/dl in <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> (p = 0. 06 versus <b>control</b> <b>dogs).</b> These changes in serum potassium, calcium and magnesium were independent of the administration of epinephrine during the resuscitation process. Changes in potassium were independent of arterial pH or bicarbonate therapy. Serum glucose increased after ventricular fibrillation but not in <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> (p < 0. 0005 versus control). No changes in other electrolytes were observed. Thus, serum potassium, calcium and magnesium decreased after resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation in this canine model.

The aim of this prospective and case-control study was to determine differences in faecal microbiota between healthy <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> and dogs with multicentric lymphoma. Twelve dogs affected by multicentric, B-cell, stage III-IV lymphoma, and 21 healthy dogs were enrolled in the study. For each dog, faecal samples were analysed by Illumina sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for selected bacterial groups. Alpha diversity was significant lower in lymphoma dogs. Principal coordinate analysis plots showed different microbial clustering (P =. 001) and linear discriminant analysis effect size revealed 28 differentially abundant bacterial groups in lymphoma and <b>control</b> <b>dogs.</b> The qPCR analysis showed significant lower abundance of Faecalibacterium spp. (q <. 001), Fusobacterium spp. (q =. 032), and Turicibacter spp. (q =. 043) in dogs with lymphoma compared with <b>control</b> <b>dogs.</b> On the contrary, Streptococcus spp. was significantly higher in dogs with lymphoma (q =. 041).

We hypothesized that low levels of C 3 are associated with the coincident occurrence of B. burgdorferi infection and glomerulonephritis in Bernese Mountain dogs. Objectives: The aims of this study were to evaluate the serum concentration of C 3 in Bernese Mountain dogs with and without antibodies against B. burgdorferi and to compare this concentration with that of healthy <b>control</b> <b>dogs.</b> Methods: Eighty-three clinically healthy Bernese Mountain <b>dogs</b> and 46 <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> were included. Antibodies against B. burgdorferi were determined using an ELISA with a whole cell sonicate as antigen. Results were confirmed using Western blot. C 3 was measured using a single radial immunodiffusion test. Results were reported as the percentage concentration of C 3 compared with that in pooled preserved canine serum (100 % C 3 concentration). Results: Median C 3 concentration was 128. 5 % in Bernese Mountain dogs with antibodies against B. burgdorferi, 133. 5 % in B. burgdorferi-negative Bernese Mountain dogs, 87. 8 % in positive <b>control</b> <b>dogs,</b> and 102. 2 % in negative <b>control</b> <b>dogs.</b> Within Bernese Mountain and control groups, C 3 was lower in dogs with antibodies against B. burgdorferi compared with those without.

Animals: Sixty-one dogs with MMVD with and without CHF. Ten healthy <b>control</b> <b>dogs.</b> Methods: Prospective observational study. Results: Radial motion: None of the systolic variables were altered and 3 of the diastolic velocities were significantly increased in dogs with CHF compared with dogs without CHF and <b>control</b> <b>dogs.</b> Longitudinal motion: 2 systolic velocities and 3 diastolic velocities were significantly increased in dogs with CHF compared with dogs without CHF and <b>control</b> <b>dogs.</b> Difference in systolic velocity time-to-peak between LV and IVS was significantly increased in dogs with MMVD with and without CHF compared with <b>control</b> <b>dogs.</b> In total, 11 (23 %) of 48 TDI and strain variables differed significantly between groups.

In the experimental inoculation study, dogs 1 and 2 were pretreated with an immunosuppressive dose of cyclosporine 14 days before inoculation and became ill after exposure to R. japonica. Dogs exhibited clinical signs, including fever, anorexia, depression, and decreased water consumption, between 36 and 96 h after inoculation, but these signs disappeared spontaneously by 5 days after inoculation. Dogs 3 and 4 were not pretreated with cyclosporine, and no clinical signs were detected in them throughout the 14 -day observation period. The <b>control</b> <b>dog</b> was clinically normal and had a normal rectal temperature throughout the study period. We attempted to detect rickettsial DNA from peripheral blood and aspiration samples from kidney and spleen by nested PCR, but all samples examined were negative. The <b>control</b> <b>dog</b> lacked detectable titers to R. japonica antigen on day 14, while positive antibodies to R. japonica were detected in all four experimentally infected dogs, with titers of 1 : 160 to 1 : 80. In the epidemiologic survey, 24 (1. 8 %) of the 1, 363 dogs examined throughout Japan had antibodies against R. japonica, with titers of 1 : 40 or more. However, we observed neither clinical signs {{at the time of}} sample collection nor nested PCR results indicative of rickettsial infection in these dogs.

40|$|AbstractThe Nucleoside Hydrolase (NH 36) is {{the main}} marker of the FML complex of Leishmania donovani, antigen of the {{licensed}} Leishmune® vaccine for prophylaxis of canine visceral leishmaniasis. As a DNA vaccine in mice, it induces a TH 1 immune response. We vaccinated mongrel dogs with the VR 1012 NH 36 vaccine for prophylaxis and immunotherapy against a high dose Leishmania chagasi infection (7 x 108  infective amastigotes). The untreated controls developed more symptoms, higher parasite/lymphocyte ratio, smaller DTH reactions, lower proportions of NH 36 -specific CD 4 + cells and sustained NH 36 -specific CD 8 + cell counts than dogs of the prophylaxis group. In the immunotherapy treated group, enlarged DTH reactions, enhanced CD 4 + and sustained CD 8 + lymphocyte proportions were also detected, however, without reduction of symptoms or parasite/lymphocyte ratio, indicating that the vaccine was sufficiently potent to prevent but not to control the disease. Both treatments determined higher survival rates. Anti-FML antibodies increased in vaccinated and control dogs while anti-NH 36 antibodies were only increased in vaccinees (p= 0. 000). The parasite load of an untreated survivor <b>control</b> <b>dog</b> (638. 05 parasites) felt outside the IC 95 % of that of vaccinated dogs (32. 02, IC 95 % 9. 45 – 64. 59) suggesting that both vaccination treatments succeeded in reducing the Leishmania infective burden. Accordingly, an untreated <b>control</b> <b>dog</b> showed lower levels of IFN γ-β, IL- 2, IL 4 but not IL- 10 β actin-relative quantification. We conclude that the VR 1012 -NH 36 vaccine induces strong prophylactic protection and a milder immunotherapeutic effect against a high dose canine experimental infection with Leishmania chagasi...|$|E
40|$|Objective—To {{describe}} {{changes in}} WBC counts, plasma cortisol concentration, and fecal parasite shedding of dogs housed in an animal shelter {{and determine the}} effects of daily petting sessions on these variables. Design—Hybrid prospective observational and experimental study. Animals— 92 healthy dogs newly arrived to an animal shelter and 15 healthy privately owned <b>dogs</b> (<b>control</b> group). Procedures—Blood and fecal samples were collected from shelter dogs 1, 3, and 10 days after arrival and from <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> once. A subset of shelter dogs (n = 15) was assigned to receive 30 minutes of petting daily. Plasma cortisol concentration was measured, CBCs were performed, and fecal samples were evaluated for parasite ova. Results—For shelter dogs, total leukocyte, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts increased significantly between days 1 and 10, with less consistent increases in monocyte count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratio. Parasite shedding was unaffected by duration of shelter stay but was greater for shelter versus <b>control</b> <b>dogs.</b> For shelter dogs, plasma cortisol concentration decreased with time and was higher than that of <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> on each day. Total leukocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte counts and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratios were also higher for shelter versus <b>control</b> <b>dogs.</b> Petting sessions resulted in a decrease in plasma cortisol concentration but in no other variables. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Large increasing immunologic responses, heavy parasite shedding, and high but decreasing plasma cortisol concentration were identified in shelter dogs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that dogs sensitized to soy antigen would produce significantly greater amounts of antigen specific IgE antibody compared to a control population before and after challenges with soy, hydrolyzed soy, and non-soy diets. Further, we sought to evaluate important allergenic components of soy using Western blot analysis. Lastly, absorption and mucosal function testing using inert sugars were evaluated for our sensitized and non-sensitized <b>controls.</b> Eight <b>dogs</b> (6 female, 2 male) were sensitized to whole soy using an established protocol. Seven dogs (3 female, 4 male) roughly age matched were used as <b>controls.</b> The <b>dogs</b> were randomly split into three groups. All dogs were fed an elimination diet of egg and Brewer's rice for six weeks. Samples were collected and each group was fed a diet of soy and rice flour, hydrolyzed soy and rice flour, or corn and rice flour for three weeks. Samples were collected and each group was fed the elimination diet followed by challenge with each of the diets. Serum was collected and stored for allergen specific IgE semi-quantitation and Western blot analysis using whole soy fractionated into globulin and whey components. A solution of monosaccharide and disaccharide sugars was administered in a volume determined by weight. Six hours after administration the dogs were catheterized and the entire urine volume was collected for measurement of sugar recovery by high pressure chromatography, followed by pulsed amphometric detection. There was a statistically significant difference in serum IgE between sensitized and <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> after the elimination diet, and also for each of the challenged diets. There were differences detected by Western blot analysis for allergens within the soy globulin and whey fractions for sensitized <b>dogs</b> compared to <b>control</b> <b>dogs.</b> There were no significant differences between sensitized and <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> for sugar recovery for any of the diets.

Chloroform is tolerated by the Eck fistula dog, which may take twice a lethal dose for the <b>control</b> <b>dog</b> without evidence of significant liver injury. Acacia given by vein is deposited in the Eck fistula liver and impairs further its functional capacity to contribute to hemoglobin production.

This interrelation of liver abnormality, liver dysfunction, and lessened plasma protein and hemoglobin production is significant. It is generally accepted that the liver is concerned with the production of several plasma proteins—fibrinogen, prothrombin, and albumin. The experiments above indicate that the liver is concerned directly or indirectly with the production of new hemoglobin.

After basal diet acclimation, serum TC increased (paired t-test, p < 0. 05) in LPC, MPC, and LPD control groups. At the same time, (X 2 lipoprotein cholesterol increased (p < 0. 05) in all three control groups. The MPC <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> also showed an increase (p = 0. 01) in cholesterol associated with the (xl fraction after diet acclimation.

RESULTS: Reactivity to canine proinsulin was detected in 3 of 15 control dogs, 8 of 15 newly-diagnosed diabetic dogs and 6 of 15 insulin-treated diabetic patients. Of these reactors, only 1 <b>control</b> <b>dog,</b> 1 newly-diagnosed diabetic dog and 3 insulin-treated diabetic dogs recognised porcine insulin by ELISA, suggesting that the remaining proinsulin reactors might have been recognising proinsulin-specific epitopes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study suggests that proinsulin autoantibodies are present in a proportion of diabetic dogs. Further work is required to refine the assay and clarify {{the significance of these}} autoantibodies...|$|E
40|$|Background. Dogs are {{compelling}} {{models in}} which to study obesity since the condition shares many characteristics between humans and dogs. Differences in eating behaviour are recognised to contribute to obesity susceptibility in other species but {{this has not been}} systematically studied in dogs. Aim. To develop and validate an owner-reported measure of canine eating behaviour and owner or dog related factors which can alter the development of obesity. Further, to then test variation in food-motivation in dogs and its association with obesity and owner management. Methods. Owner interviews, a literature review and existing human appetite scales were used to identify relevant topics and generate items for the questionnaire. Following a pilot phase, a 75 item online questionnaire was distributed via social media. Responses from 302 dog/owner dyads were analysed and factor structure and descriptive statistics calculated. Results were compared with descriptions of dog behaviour and management from a subset of respondents during semi-structured interviews. The optimum questions were disseminated as a 34 item final questionnaire completed by 213 owners, with a subset of respondents repeating the questionnaire 3 weeks later to assess test–retest reliability. Results. Analysis of responses to the final questionnaire relating to 213 dog/owner dyads showed a coherent factor structure and good test–retest reliability. There were three dog factors (food responsiveness and satiety, lack of selectivity, Interest in food), four owner factors (owner motivation to <b>control</b> <b>dog</b> weight, owner intervention to <b>control</b> <b>dog</b> weight, restriction of human food, exercise taken) and two dog health factors (signs of gastrointestinal disease, current poor health). Eating behaviour differed between individuals and between breed groups. High scores on dog factors (high food-motivation) and low scores on owner factors (less rigorous control of diet/exercise) were associated with obesity. Owners of more highly food-motivated dogs exerted more control over their dogs’ food intake than those of less food-motivated dogs. Conclusions. The DORA questionnaire is a reliable and informative owner-reported measure of canine eating behaviour and health and management factors which can be associated with obesity development. The tool will be applicable to study of the canine obesity model and to clinical veterinarians. Results revealed eating behaviour to be similarly associated with obesity as exercise and owners giving titbits...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to determine whether bovine colostrum or placenta could {{be a source of}} infection of Neospora caninum for dogs. For this purpose, two dogs were fed bovine colostrum to which culture-derived N. caninum tachyzoites were added and two other dogs were fed placental cotyledonary tissue from N. caninum seropositive cows. One dog served as a negative control during the start of the experiment but this <b>control</b> <b>dog</b> was fed cotyledonary tissue later on. None of the dogs did produce serum antibodies to N. caninum. All three dogs that were fed cotyledonary tissue did shed N. caninum oocysts, but no oocyst shedding was seen in the two dogs that were fed colostrum with N. caninum tachyzoites. Oocyst excretion did not resume in two dogs after repeated feeding of N. caninum infected placenta. The identity of the oocysts was confirmed by a bioassay in gerbils. It is concluded that ingestion of bovine placenta by dogs is an effective mode of transmission of N. caninum from cattle to dogs.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine whether renal prostaglandins are in-volved in the renal vasodilation evoked by angiotensin II inhibition in sodium depletion. The convert-ing enzyme inhibitor (CEI) captopril was administered to sodium-depleted <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> and sodium-depleted dogs that had previously received the inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis, indomethacin or meclofenamate. CEI in <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> increased renal blood flow (RBF) from a mean value of 220 to 309 ml/min (p < 0. 01) and decreased renal vascular resistance (RVR) from 0. 64 to 0. 38 arbitrary resistance units (ru) (p < 0. 01). Renal venous prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) concentration also increased from 52 to 85 pg/ml (p < 0. 01). In the dogs that received inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis, RBF fell from 214 to 168 ml/min (p < 0. 01), RVR increased from 0. 61 to 0. 82 ru (p < 0. 05), and renal venous PGE 2 fell from 114 to 20 pg/ml. (p < 0. 01). The subsequent administration of captopril increased RBF from 168 to 221 ml/min (p < 0. 01), lowered RVR from 0. 82 to 0. 43 ru (p < 0. 01), but failed to significantly increase renal venous~RGE 2 (20 to 25 pg/ml). The decrease in RVR induced by captopril was not significantly different in the <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> and in the dogs with prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. However, in the <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> RBF after captopril was significantly higher than during the control period; {{this was not the case}} in the dogs with prostaglandin synthesis inhibition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Much of {{the current}} {{pharmacological}} therapy for chronic heart failure targets neurohormonal activation. In spite of recent advances in drug therapy, the mortality rate for chronic heart failure remains high. Activation of the carotid baroreceptor (BR) reduces sympathetic outflow and augments vagal tone. We investigated the effect of chronic activation of the carotid BR on hemodynamic and neurohormonal parameters and on mortality in dogs with chronic heart failure. Fifteen dogs were instrumented to record hemodynamics. Electrodes were applied around the carotid sinuses to allow for activation of the BR. After 2 weeks of pacing (250 bpm), electrical carotid BR activation was initiated in 7 dogs and continued {{for the remainder of}} the study. The start of BR activation was used as a time reference point for the remaining 8 <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> that did not receive BR activation. Survival was significantly greater for dogs undergoing carotid BR activation compared with <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> (68. 17. 4 versus 37. 33. 2 days, respectively; P 0. 01), although arterial pressure, resting heart rate, and left ventricular pressure were not different over time in BR-activated versus <b>control</b> <b>dogs.</b> Plasma norepinephrine was lower in dogs receiving BR activation therapy 31 days after the start of BR activation (401. 9151. 5 versus 1121. 9389. 1 pg/mL in dogs not receiving activation therapy; P 0. 05). Plasma angiotensin II increased less in dogs receiving activation therapy (plasma angiotensin II increased by 157. 458. 6 pg/mL in <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> versus 10. 114. 0 pg/mL in dogs receiving activation therapy; P 0. 02). We conclude that chronic activation of the carotid BR improves survival and suppresses neurohormonal activation in chronic heart failure...|$|R
40|$|Serology is {{currently}} {{used for the}} diagnosis of canine sino-nasal aspergillosis (SNA). However, the accuracy of serological testing using commercially available, standardized purified antigen preparations of Aspergillus (CAPurAspAg) has only been poorly documented. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the diagnostic value of an agar-gel double immunodiffusion (AGDD) test and an anti-Aspergillus IgG ELISA, using CAPurAspAg and the commercially available Platelia test for the detection of serum galactomannan. Sera from 17 dogs with SNA, 18 dogs with a nasal tumour (NT), 11 dogs with lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis (LPR) and 33 <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> were tested with the 3 methods. AGDD result was positive in 76. 5 % of dogs with SNA, whereas all sera from dogs with non-fungal nasal disease and <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> were negative. A positive IgG ELISA result was obtained in 88 % of dogs with SNA and in 18 % of dogs with LPR. All patients with NT and <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> had a negative IgG ELISA result. The Platelia test was positive in 24 % of dogs with SNA, 11 % of dogs with NT, 9 % of dogs with LPR and 24 % of <b>control</b> <b>dogs.</b> The results of this study suggest that (1) the detection of serum Aspergillus-specific antibodies with AGDD or ELISA, using CAPurAspAg, provides excellent specificity and good sensitivity, (2) the specificity is higher for AGDD (100 %) than for ELISA (96. 8 %) while sensitivity is higher for ELISA (88. 2 %) than for AGDD (76. 5 %) and (3) serum galactomannan quantification with the Plateliat test is unreliable for the diagnosis of canine SNA.

40|$|Larvicidal {{effects of}} {{levamisole}} hydrochloride to developing stages of Dirofilaria immitis were evaluated in the experimentally infected dogs. Four groups of dogs were administered 1, 30, 60 and 90 days after infection with 5 mg/kg, t. i. d. (15 mg/kg/day) of levamisole hydrochloride for 5 days (Table 1). In two experimental groups medicated at 60 or 90 days postinfection, the drug showed complete or least certain prophylactic effects against D. immitis infection. On the other hand, {{in the other}} two experimental groups medicated at 1 or 30 days postinfection, relatively low larvicidal effects were seen. To the contrary, mean infection rate in <b>control</b> <b>dog</b> group was 35. 7 %. The worm development in these two medicated groups was significantly depressed in comparison with those from control group (Table 2).

40|$|Abstract Background Myocardial injury may {{contribute}} to unexpected deaths due to pyometra. To detect myocardial damage, measurement of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is currently the most sensitive and specific method. The aims {{of the present study}} were to evaluate presence of myocardial damage in canine pyometra by analysis of cTnI, to explore whether myocardial injury was associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and to evaluate whether other clinical or laboratory parameters were associated with cTnI increase. Methods Preoperative plasma levels of cTnI were investigated in 58 female dogs with pyometra and 9 controls. The value of physical examination findings, haematological, serum biochemical and pro-inflammatory (CRP and TNF-α) parameters as possible predictors of increased cTnI levels was also evaluated. Results Seven dogs with pyometra (12 %) and one <b>control</b> <b>dog</b> (11 %) had increased levels of cTnI. In the pyometra group, the levels ranged between 0. 3 – 0. 9 μg l - 1 and in the <b>control</b> <b>dog</b> the level was 0. 3 μg l - 1. The cTnI levels did not differ significantly between the two groups. No cardiac abnormalities were evident on preoperative physical examinations. Four of the pyometra patients died within two weeks of surgery, of which two were examined post mortem. In one of these cases (later diagnosed with myocarditis and disseminated bacterial infection) the cTnI levels increased from 0. 9 μg l - 1 preoperatively to 180 μg l - 1 the following day when also heart arrhythmia was also detected. The other patient had cTnI levels of 0. 7 μg l - 1 with no detectable heart pathology post mortem. CTnI increase was not associated with presence of SIRS. There was a trend for the association of cTnI increase with increased mortality. No preoperative physical examination findings and few but unspecific laboratory parameters were associated with increased cTnI levels. Conclusion Increased cTnI levels were observed in 12 % of the dogs with pyometra. The proportions of dogs with cTnI increase did not differ significantly in the pyometra group compared with the control group. CTnI increase was not associated with presence of SIRS. A trend for association of cTnI increase and mortality was observed. Preoperative physical examination findings and included laboratory parameters were poor predictors of increased cTnI levels. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Nucleoside Hydrolase (NH 36) is {{the main}} marker of the FML complex of Leishmania donovani, antigen of the {{licensed}} Leishmune® vaccine for prophylaxis of canine visceral leishmaniasis. As a DNA vaccine in mice, it induces a TH 1 immune response. We vaccinated mongrel dogs with the VR 1012 NH 36 vaccine for prophylaxis and immunotherapy against a high dose Leishmania chagasi infection (7 x 108 infective amastigotes). The untreated controls developed more symptoms, higher parasite/lymphocyte ratio, smaller DTH reactions, lower proportions of NH 36 -specific CD 4 + cells and sustained NH 36 -specific CD 8 + cell counts than dogs of the prophylaxis group. In the immunotherapy treated group, enlarged DTH reactions, enhanced CD 4 + and sustained CD 8 + lymphocyte proportions were also detected, however, without reduction of symptoms or parasite/lymphocyte ratio, indicating that the vaccine was sufficiently potent to prevent but not to control the disease. Both treatments determined higher survival rates. Anti-FML antibodies increased in vaccinated and control dogs while anti-NH 36 antibodies were only increased in vaccinees (p= 0. 000). The parasite load of an untreated survivor <b>control</b> <b>dog</b> (638. 05 parasites) felt outside the IC 95...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Data on the {{long-term}} outcome of B. burgdorferi infections in adult dogs are sparse. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate whether Bernese Mountain dogs with serological evidence of natural B. burgdorferi infection more often develop signs such as lameness, azotemia or proteinuria during a follow-up period of 2. 5 to 3. 0 years. Seropositive Bernese Mountain dogs were compared to seronegative Bernese Mountain dogs and to seropositive and seronegative <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> of other breeds. Dogs included in a previous study on the prevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi in Bernese Mountain dogs were re-evaluated. Antibodies against B. burgdorferi were determined using an ELISA with a whole-cell sonicate as antigen and results were confirmed using a Western blot assay. Results Fifty-three Bernese Mountain <b>dogs</b> and 30 <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> were re-evaluated. Re-evaluation was performed between 2. 5 and 3. 0 years (median 2. 7 years) after the first assessment. The age of the dogs at the second evaluation ranged from 3 to 11 years (median 6 years). There were no significant differences with regard to poor general condition or lameness between the first and the second evaluation. At the first evaluation 22 (42 %) of the Bernese Mountain dogs and 11 (37 %) of the <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> were considered positive for antibodies against B. burgdorferi. At the second evaluation 25 (47 %) of the Bernese Mountain dogs and 12 (40 %) of the <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> were considered positive; 69 % of the dogs showed the same serological result at both examinations and 31 % were seroconverted or seroreverted. During the first examination, azotemia was diagnosed in 6 Bernese Mountain dogs and during the second examination in 11 Bernese Mountain <b>dogs.</b> No <b>control</b> <b>dogs</b> had azotemia in this study. In seropositive dogs there was no increase in lameness or signs of renal disease over time. Conclusion It may be concluded that antibodies against B. burgdorferi determined by whole cell ELISA and confirmed by Western blot were neither associated with the development of lameness nor with signs of renal disease like azotemia or proteinuria in dogs observed over a period of 2. 5 to 3. 0 years. </p...|$|R
