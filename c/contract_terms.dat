5|$|Cagney's last {{movie in}} 1935 was Ceiling Zero, his third film with Pat O'Brien. O'Brien {{received}} top billing, {{which was a}} clear breach of Cagney's contract. This, combined {{with the fact that}} Cagney had made five movies in 1934, again against his <b>contract</b> <b>terms,</b> caused him to bring legal proceedings against Warner Bros. for breach of contract. The dispute dragged on for several months. Cagney received calls from David Selznick and Sam Goldwyn, but neither felt in a position to offer him work while the dispute went on. Meanwhile, while being represented by his brother William in court, Cagney went back to New York to search for a country property where he could indulge his passion for farming.|$|E

5|$|In 1996 {{the company}} {{repaired}} {{its relationship with}} its franchisees by immediately dropping the most contentious of the <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> that had been proposed by chairman John Cranor five years previously. The 1976 contract was restored, including the 1.5 mile outlet exclusivity zone, while the parent company gained greater control over national advertising. Novak also axed the Colonel's Rotisserie Gold product and introduced a new non-fried item called the Tender Roast. Tender Roast was served by piece, as with the fried chicken, {{in contrast with the}} rotisserie product, which had been sold in quarter, half or whole chicken portions. Afterwards, Novak oversaw ten fiscal quarters of consecutive growth at KFC North America. As a result of his success at KFC North America, Novak became President and CEO of the entire KFC organization in 1996.|$|E

Daley in 2005. The more than 80 investors include some of Daley's friends and neighbors. One of the most financially successful restaurants in Chicago, the Park Grill remains exempt from property taxes after a multi-year litigation which reached the Illinois Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|If the bid was rejected, the NPB team {{retained}} {{rights to}} the player. If it was accepted, the successful MLB team was granted the exclusive rights {{to negotiate with the}} player for 30days. If the player and the MLB team agreed on <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> before the 30-day period expired, the NPB team received the bid amount as a transfer fee within five business days. The player was then free to play for his new MLB team in the coming season. The transfer fee was not included when calculating an MLB team's total payroll, which is subject to a luxury tax when it exceeds $155million. If the MLB team could not come to a contract agreement with the posted player, then no fee was paid and the {{rights to the}} player reverted to his NPB team. A player could request to be posted again in subsequent years, and the process would be repeated with no advantage to the club that had won the bidding the previous year.|$|E

Fido customers with multiple lines are deemed to be in the second category if at least one line is on a FidoDOLLARS-earning <b>contracted</b> <b>term</b> that goes beyond April 6, 2016.

25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Parliament passed its first {{comprehensive}} incursion into {{the doctrine of}} contractual freedom in the Unfair <b>Contract</b> <b>Terms</b> Act 1977. The topic of unfair terms is vast, and could equally include specific contracts falling under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, the Employment Rights Act 1996 or the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. Legislation, particularly regarding consumer protection, is also frequently being updated by the European Union, in laws like the Flight Delay Compensation Regulation, or the Electronic Commerce Directive, which are subsequently translated into domestic law through a statutory instrument authorised through the European Communities Act 1972 section 2(2), as for example with the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000. The primary legislation on unfair consumer <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> deriving from the EU {{is found in the}} Consumer Rights Act 2015. The Law Commission had drafted a unified Unfair <b>Contract</b> <b>Terms</b> Bill, but Parliament chose to maintain two extensive documents.|$|E

This contract included the rights to his show over terrestrial radio, internet rights, and specific to airing on KLSX; this kept Leykis from appearing on any other CBS station. In addition, CBS also would not allow podcasts for them, as they were concentrating on other online ventures at the time.

AMAX Energy purchased an undisclosed number of emissions allowances from Long Island Lighting Company, which it said it would offer in packages with its coal and natural gas contracts. Thus, coal suppliers began participating along with electric utilities as buyers and sellers of marketable sulfur dioxide emissions allowances.|$|E
25|$|Admiralty Orders of 14 November 1755 {{indicated}} that the Alderney-class vessels were to be built at private dockyards, leaving the Royal Dockyards fully engaged in constructing or fitting-out the larger ships of the line.

In consequence only regional shipwrights were invited to bid for Diligence, with the contract awarded on 27 February 1756 to William Wells and Company, a private shipyard in Deptford. <b>Contract</b> <b>terms</b> stipulated that the vessel be completed within six months.|$|E
