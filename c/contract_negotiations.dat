40|$|Abstract. The {{support of}} QoS {{properties}} in component-based software requires the run-time selection of appropriate concrete QoS contracts at the ports of the interacting components. Such a selection process is called QoS <b>contract</b> <b>negotiation.</b> This paper discusses {{the architecture of}} a QoS <b>contract</b> <b>negotiation</b> framework {{and how it is}} implemented in our prototype. The framework can be integrated in a component container and act as a run-time support environment when QoS Contracts are negotiated under different application scenarios. Our approach is based on: (i) the notion that the required and provided QoS properties as well as resource demands are specified at the component level; and (ii) that QoS <b>contract</b> <b>negotiation</b> is modeled as a constraint solving problem. ...|$|R

5|$|As initial <b>contract</b> <b>negotiations</b> {{failed in}} the off-season, Cloutier filed for {{arbitration}} on July 16, 2004. Arbitration was avoided by both sides when Cloutier agreed to a one-year, $3 million contract 11 days later. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, however, Cloutier spent the season mostly inactive until signing with EC KAC of the Austrian Hockey League on January 20, 2005. Replacing injured starter Andrew Verner, he appeared in 13 games with the Klagenfurt-based team, going undefeated with a 1.94 GAA. EC KAC finished the regular season second with the second-best record in the league. Cloutier appeared in 10 additional playoff games, recording a 2.75 GAA.

5|$|Bill Wood, the Astros' general manager, {{said the}} team {{believed}} Nevin {{was close to}} a major-league level and would require little development in minor league baseball. As evidence for this, the Astros pointed to Nevin's training with the wooden bats used in professional baseball {{in an effort to}} prepare himself for the transition from metal bats. The Astros believed he would be a solid power hitter and have a strong work ethic. Nevin also did not intend to seek a signing bonus approaching those received by Van Poppel and Taylor. The Astros decided to employ Nevin as a third baseman. Not wanting to draw out his <b>contract</b> <b>negotiations,</b> Nevin signed with Houston in June, receiving a $700,000 bonus.|$|E

Starting on November25, turnpike management personnel collected flat-rate passenger tolls of $2 and commercial tolls of $15 from cash customers on the ticketed system, while E-ZPass customers were charged the lesser of the actual toll or the same flat rates.

5|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{together}} with the Writers Guild of America {{at the end of}} 2007. The broadcasting of The Simpsons was not affected by the strike.

So the strike would have had to go on for a while for the show to have run out of new episodes. Production of season 20 was further delayed because of <b>contract</b> <b>negotiations</b> with the six main voice actors. The dispute was resolved, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. The delay in production has caused the planned 22 episodes to be shortened to 20.|$|E

5|$|Becoming a {{restricted}} free {{agent in the}} off-season, Morrison was given a one-year qualifying offer with a reported value of approximately US$500,000. With the Devils unwilling to increase their offer, he left in September 1999 for Třebíč, Czech Republic, where fellow Devils restricted free agent Patrik Eliáš was also holding out. While overseas, Morrison and Eliáš played for Czech teams SK Horácká Slavia Třebíč and HC Pardubice {{as they waited for}} <b>contract</b> <b>negotiations</b> to resume. Morrison was pointless in two games with Třebíč and recorded seven points in five games with Pardubice. On October 24, 1999, Morrison and Eliáš agreed to new contracts with the Devils. After recording 26 points over 44 games with the Devils, Morrison was traded to the Vancouver Canucks on March 14, 2000, alongside centre Denis Pederson, in exchange for winger Alexander Mogilny.

In the fall of 2006, during an impasse in <b>contract</b> <b>negotiations</b> between the Corzine administration and the state's seven major state employee unions (including the CWA), Katz contacted the governor by phone and e-mail to lobby for a renewal of the negotiations. Their relationship and the financial settlement Katz received after their breakup led to allegations of many potential conflicts of interest in labor negotiations while Corzine was governor. A state ethics panel, acting on a complaint from Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz's contact with Corzine during negotiations did not violate the governor's code of conduct.|$|E
