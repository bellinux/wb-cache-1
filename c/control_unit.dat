5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1960s, Liberia {{dispatched}} troops, including a movement <b>control</b> <b>unit,</b> to support ONUC during the Congo Crisis, and were airlifted into the Congo by the United States Air Force. The Liberian troops were initially in Équateur province. In 1961, during their first combat action in country, 300 Liberian troops repelled an attack by 5,000 Baluba tribesmen and their European officers.|$|E
50|$|Quite often, {{one system}} will perform both torque and <b>control</b> functions. Individual <b>units</b> are {{designed}} for use in either torque or control systems. Some torque units {{can be used as}} <b>control</b> <b>units,</b> but <b>control</b> <b>units</b> cannot replace torque units.|$|R

30|$|We {{assume that}} similar to [10], the two {{proposed}} algorithms {{are carried out}} at a central <b>controlling</b> <b>unit,</b> which can be any node in the system. The <b>controlling</b> <b>unit</b> has knowledge of the global channel state information (CSI). After the convergence of the algorithms, the <b>controlling</b> <b>unit</b> sends {{the information on the}} optimal source, relay, and receiver matrices to corresponding nodes.|$|R
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was controlled by}} a fighter-type control stick and rudder bar which operated the powered flying controls (PFCs). Each PFC had a single electro-hydraulic powered flying <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (PFCU) except the rudder which had two, one running as a back-up. Artificial feel and autostabilisation {{in the form of}} pitch and yaw dampers were provided, as well as an auto mach trimmer.|$|E
5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was a {{significant}} improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an electric motor. Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure {{would result in a}} loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{review board}} {{determined}} that the electrical power momentarily failed at 23:30:55 GMT, and found evidence of several electric arcs in the interior equipment. They were unable to identify conclusively a single ignition source. They {{determined that the}} fire most likely started near {{the floor in the}} lower left section of the cabin, close to the Environmental <b>Control</b> <b>Unit.</b> It spread from the left wall of the cabin to the right, with the floor being affected only briefly.|$|E
50|$|The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are {{typically}} wall-mounted control panels {{and can be}} mounted in a NEMA enclosure. <b>Control</b> <b>units</b> vary by technology by using line and load terminal blocks, relays, activation terminals, transformers, as well as monitoring electronics.|$|R
40|$|Drive <b>control</b> <b>units</b> {{and their}} systems are {{characterized}} by different phenomena and technologies involving multi-domain physics across different technological domains. This report discusses multi-domain simulation effective in predicting multi-domain physics and effective measures for drive <b>control</b> <b>units</b> in the design phase...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel technique {{used to estimate}} the power dissipation of <b>control</b> <b>units</b> at the architectural level. Based on the instruction stream and output signals of the <b>control</b> <b>units,</b> this approaclh provides accurate power consump-tion data without any knowledge of their logic structures. It is a top-down hierarchical method which can handle random logic <b>control</b> <b>units</b> as well as ROlM and PLA based <b>control</b> <b>units.</b> The upper-level power estimation analyzes the instructions through their formats, and produces an efflcient energy model for instruction format transitions. The lower-level estimation is performed for each instruction format by tracing the transitions of output signals. For simple logic <b>control</b> <b>units,</b> predictable internal signals can be used instead of output signals. We have applied this technique into an architectural level power estimator of a real processor. The accuracy of the estimator is demonstrated by comparing the power values it produces against measurements made by a gate level power simulator for the name benchmark set. The results show that our estimation approach for <b>control</b> <b>units</b> can provide more accurate solution than statistical analysis and is more efflcient than conventional look-up table based methods...|$|R
5|$|After the Belgian Grand Prix on 2 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at various European race circuits between 4–7 September {{to prepare for}} the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari, Williams, BAR, Jordan and Minardi tested at the Mugello Circuit. Rubens Barrichello for Ferrari set the fastest times on the first and second days. The second day of testing was disrupted on six occasions after BAR test driver Takuma Sato went off the circuit, suffered an electronic <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> failure and had a malfunctioning anti-stall system. BAR driver Olivier Panis and Minardi driver Alex Yoong both had problems with their clutch and gearboxes. On the final day Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1 minute and 24.226 seconds, four-tenths ahead of Panis. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent three days at his team's private test track the Fiorano Circuit where he did practice starts as well as testing of launch control and traction control.|$|E
5|$|An enemy scout {{discovered}} Nulli Secunda quietly {{attempting to}} regain control with their Territorial Control Units (TCU). At around 14:00 UTC, with an hour remaining before Nulli Secunda could regain control, the CFC and Russian coalition sent a capital fleet to the station. RAZOR Alliance took the station, and the Russians destroyed the N3/PL Territorial <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> and set up its own TCU {{in order to establish}} control. Capturing the B-R5RB system would enable the CFC and Russian coalition to trap Pandemic Legion assets, including hundreds of capital and sub-capital ships, thus preventing those ships from joining the war. CFC and Russian coalition forces scrambled to gain control of the system, with thousands of players logging on and preparing their fleets.|$|E
5|$|Between 1970 and 1973, as a stop-gap pending {{delivery}} of the long-delayed General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber, Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons flew leased F-4E Phantoms. No.2 Squadron continued to fly Canberras until it was disbanded in 1982. After taking {{delivery of}} their F-111Cs in 1973, Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons operated the type for 37 years through numerous upgrades, augmented in the mid-1990s by ex-USAF Gmodels. The forward air <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> joined No.82 Wing in 2002. In 2010, the wing retired its F-111s {{and replaced them with}} Super Hornets as an interim force until the planned entry into Australian service of the F-35 LightningII Joint Strike Fighter. Twelve Boeing EA-18G Growlers are scheduled to augment the Super Hornet fleet from 2017.|$|E
50|$|Hardwired <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are {{implemented}} {{through use of}} combinational logic units, featuring {{a finite number of}} gates that can generate specific results based on the instructions that were used to invoke those responses.

50|$|The SANDF {{acquired}} 169 Oerlikon 35mm guns, {{along with}} 75 Superfledermaus fire <b>control</b> <b>units</b> (FCUs) in 1963. In 1990, 48 of these Mark (Mk) I guns were upgraded to Mk V {{status and the}} Superfledermaus fire <b>control</b> <b>units</b> were replaced by Italian LPD20 radars.|$|R
5|$|Posted to Britain in April 1944, Barr went ashore at Omaha Beach {{two days}} after D-Day {{as part of an}} air support <b>control</b> <b>unit.</b> During the {{campaign}} in Normandy, he flew rocket-armed Hawker Typhoons on operations against V-1 flying bomb launch sites. After his return to Australia on 11September, Barr was promoted to acting wing commander and appointed chief instructor at No.2 Operational Training Unit in Mildura, Victoria, taking over from Bobby Gibbes. He also went to New Guinea and flew some ground-attack missions in the Kittyhawk to gain experience in the South West Pacific theatre. Following the end of hostilities in August 1945, Barr was treated for recurring fever and underwent two operations on his limbs in No.6 RAAF Hospital, Heidelberg. He was discharged from the Air Force on 8October.|$|E
5|$|The Command and Service Modules were mated in the KSC {{altitude}} chamber in September, and combined system testing was performed. Altitude testing was performed first unmanned, then {{with both the}} prime and backup crews, from October 10 through December 30. During this testing, the Environmental <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> in the Command Module {{was found to have}} a design flaw, and was sent back to the manufacturer for design changes and rework. The returned ECU then leaked water/glycol coolant, and had to be returned a second time. Also during this time, a propellant tank in Service Module 017 had ruptured during testing at NAA, prompting the separation of the modules and removal from the chamber so the Service Module could be tested for signs of the tank problem. These tests were negative.|$|E
5|$|At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong {{opened the}} hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> {{controls}} {{on his chest}} kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface. The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing {{the quality of the}} picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.|$|E

5|$|Some drivers {{elected to}} make pit stops under caution. Fittipaldi had his engine <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> and spark box changed on lap 17 after he {{reported}} {{a problem with}} his car. Bräck remained the leader at the lap-21 restart and {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Andretti began to reduce the gap between Bräck and himself between laps 31 and 33. Tagliani reduced his pace between the second and third turns on lap 42, and was ordered by his engineer to enter the pit lane. His crew removed his car's left sidepod and retired on the next lap with a battery problem. A second caution was necessitated on the 46th lap when debris was located in turn two. The leaders made their pit stops because of the mandatory pit stop window. Fittipaldi's car problem re-emerged on the 44th lap despite having his vehicle's coils and springs changed; he drove to the pit lane to retire because his team's mechanics could not rectify the issue. Franchitti stalled his car because of a clutch issue. Bräck maintained the first position at the lap-52 restart, followed by Takagi. Nine laps later, Takagi attempted to pass Bräck around the outside for the first position but was unable to complete the manoeuvre because of the presence of slower cars.|$|E
5|$|Webber passed Rast for sixth place, while Poulsen retired {{because of}} {{accident}} damage {{while attempting to}} return to the pit lane. Dumas held a 24-second advantage over Lotterer with di Grassi in third, while Evans moved back into the LMP2 lead. Both Toyota cars were battling for fourth position with Webber close behind. Webber overtook Davidson for fifth at the Radillion corner exit moving ahead of Sarrazin on the Kemmel straight one lap later. Di Grassi slowed with technical problems and limped into his garage for an engine <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> and front-left nose change. Toyota's No. 1 car was pushed into its garage with mechanical problems; it rejoined the circuit for a few laps until a throttle problem emerged, causing the car to run at a reduced pace. Lotterer retook the lead after the No. 18 Porsche driver switch took longer than expected. Rast passed Conway around the outside for fourth at the Bus Stop chicane. Vilander challenged Lietz for second in LMGTE Pro until Vilander was issued a track limit abuse penalty. Lotterer and Lieb battled each other for first place. Lotterer drove defensively after passing slower traffic going into Les Combes corner to keep the position. Lieb ran wide off the track at the Stavelot corner exit while lapping a slower car.|$|E
5|$|During June, Australians {{also contributed}} to the defence of the Allied beachhead against German air and naval attacks. No. 453Squadron and the RAAF fighter pilots in RAF units {{continued}} to fly patrols over the beachhead in the week after D-Day, but only rarely encountered German aircraft. From 11 June the Australian squadron's aircraft frequently operated from airfields built at Normandy, and on the 25th of the month it and the other units of No.125 Wing moved from the UK to Advanced Landing Ground B11 within the beachhead near Longues-sur-Mer. By late June, No.453 Squadron and the other RAF Spitfire units were regularly attacking German positions in Normandy as well as providing air defence for the Allied forces in the area; during the month the squadron flew more than 700 sorties. A small number of Australians posted to RAF squadrons equipped with Hawker Typhoon fighter-bombers also attacked German vehicles and positions in direct support of the Allied ground troops throughout the month. No.456 Squadron, which was one of four night fighter squadrons assigned to protect the beachhead, frequently met German aircraft and shot down twelve of them in the week after the landing. Australian fighter ace Flight Lieutenant Nicky Barr, who had escaped from German custody in Italy during 1943, also briefly served in an air support <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> in Normandy. Barr landed at Omaha Beach on 9 June, but returned to the UK three days later as his commanding officer believed that German forces would execute Barr if they recaptured him.|$|E
