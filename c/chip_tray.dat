5000|$|Mark Bowden {{reports in}} the Atlantic that {{blackjack}} player Don Johnson broke the bank in 2011 winning nearly $6 million at Atlantic City’s Tropicana casino after previously taking the Borgata for $5 million and Caesars for $4 million. The Tropicana refused to continue playing with Johnson on the terms the casino had negotiated after Johnson won $5.8 million, the Borgata cut Johnson off at $5 million, and the dealer at Caesars refused to fill Johnson's <b>chip</b> <b>tray</b> once his earnings topped $4 million. Johnson had reportedly negotiated terms with the Tropicana that included a hand-shuffled six-deck shoe; the right to split and double down on up to four hands at once; and a “soft 17" [...] whittling the house edge down to one-fourth of 1 percent so in effect, Johnson was playing a 50-50 game against the house, and with the 20% [...] "loss rebate", Johnson was risking only 80 cents of every dollar he played.|$|E

50|$|Tokens are {{employed}} for several reasons. Because of the uniform size, shape, {{and patterns of}} stacks of chips, they are easier to tally compared to currency. This attribute also enables the pit boss or security to quickly verify the amount being paid, reducing the chance that a dealer might incorrectly pay a customer. The uniform weight of the casino's official tokens allows them to weigh great stacks or heaps of chips rather than tally them. (Though aids such as <b>chip</b> <b>trays</b> are far more common.) Furthermore, {{it is observed that}} consumers gamble more freely with replacement currencies than with cash. A more pragmatic reason for casinos using chips in place of cash at table games is to discourage players from grabbing back their bet and attempting to flee should their bet not win, because chips, unlike cash, must be redeemed at the casino cashier and have no value outside the casino in question. Lastly, the chips are considered to {{be an integral part of}} the casino environment, and replacing them with some alternate currency would be unpopular.|$|R

40|$|Chip-trays are plastic {{containers}} that are 50. 5 cm long by 5. 5 cm wide by 3. 5 cm deep, and contain 20 compartments - or cells - {{that can be}} closed with a snap lock lid. Traditionally used by geologists (e. g. to store drill core fragments), for the past 5 years we have routinely used <b>chip</b> <b>trays</b> {{in a range of}} soil applications including soil survey, forensic investigations and mineralogical studies. This paper, however, focuses on recent adaptations to acid sulfate soil (ASS) protocols that rely on the use of chip-trays, which offer significant improvements to field sampling and soil storage, and provide the means for a new laboratory incubation method of ASS materials to better characterise and classify ASS types, including hypersulfidic, hyposulfidic and sulfuric materials. The chip tray-based improvements to ASS protocols have found use {{in a wide range of}} projects in diverse Australian ASS landscapes (e. g. coastal, and inland upland, wetland and riverine environments). For example, characterising hydro-toposequences, constructing ASS processes models and use in ASS risk assessment protocols.

A cam and spring return mechanism was used to achieve both the feeding and the slicing operations. The machine was made as simple as possible for easy repairs and maintenance. It is designed such that the machine slices one tuber of plantain over one revolution of the cam. A conveyor rolls sliced <b>chips</b> to a <b>tray</b> {{with the help of a}} Geneva drive mechanism (or timer). A variable speed pulley system was used to reduce the motor speed to desired value.

40|$|Non {{uniformity}} of {{final moisture content}} of the product being dried is {{the main drawback of}} tray dryers. The difficulty in maintaining the uniform air velocity throughout the drying chamber had been identified as the main reason for this non uniform drying. A CFD model was developed to analyses the velocity and temperature profiles of a cinnamon chips dryer by using STAR CD. The modeled data for air velocities had been experimentally verified for velocity distribution within the drying chamber. The CFD analysis revealed the presence of non uniform air re-circulating zones at the inlet air duct and drying chamber, which results in non {{uniformity of}} air velocities. Previously reported variations of moisture level in dried cinnamon <b>chips</b> at different <b>tray</b> locations were compared with modeled velocity distributions of the present study. The results indicated that the variations in the moisture level of dried cinnamon chips were directly attributed to the non uniform air distributions at different tray location...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in synchrotron sources, beamline optics and detectors are driving a renaissance in room-temperature data collection. The underlying impetus is {{the recognition that}} conformational differences are observed in functionally important regions of structures determined using crystals kept at ambient as opposed to cryogenic temperature during data collection. In addition, room-temperature measurements enable time-resolved studies and eliminate the need to find suitable cryoprotectants. Since radiation damage limits the high-resolution data that {{can be obtained from}} a single crystal, especially at room temperature, data are typically collected in a serial fashion using a number of crystals to spread the total dose over the entire ensemble. Several approaches have been developed over the years to efficiently exchange crystals for room-temperature data collection. These include in situ collection in <b>trays,</b> <b>chips</b> and capillary mounts. Here, the use of a slowly flowing microscopic stream for crystal delivery is demonstrated, resulting in extremely high-throughput delivery of crystals into the X-ray beam. This free-stream technology, which was originally developed for serial femtosecond crystallography at X-ray free-electron lasers, is here adapted to serial crystallography at synchrotrons. By embedding the crystals in a high-viscosity carrier stream, high-resolution room-temperature studies can be conducted at atmospheric pressure using the unattenuated X-ray beam, thus permitting the analysis of small or weakly scattering crystals. The high-viscosity extrusion injector is described, as is its use to collect high-resolution serial data from native and heavy-atom-derivatized lysozyme crystals at the Swiss Light Source using less than half a milligram of protein crystals. The room-temperature serial data allow de novo structure determination. The crystal size used in this proof-of-principle experiment was dictated by the available flux density. However, upcoming developments in beamline optics, detectors and synchrotron sources will enable the use of true microcrystals. This high-throughput, high-dose-rate methodology provides a new route to investigating the structure and dynamics of macromolecules at ambient temperatur...|$|R
40|$|Drying {{process has}} been {{identified}} {{as one of the most}} important preprocessing techniques in cinnamon oil production industry. Drying at closed and controlled environment was selected as a solution to mitigate the drawbacks of conventional sun drying of cinnamon. The common drawbacks are long processing times, labor cost and the deterioration of the quality due to several factors such as dust, moisture and insects. Optimizing the drying operation can reduce the post harvesting losses. This research focuses on investigation of the drying behavior of cinnamon chips and the effect of drying on the yield and quality of cinnamon bark oil. Drying process was experimentally investigated using a tray dryer which provided convective drying with hot air. This dryer consisted of a stove, heat exchanging system and drying chamber and is driven by biomass. Hot air temperatures of 35 C, 40 C, 45 C and 50 C were selected while the air velocity was kept constant. The applicability of three commonly used mathematical models was evaluated by examining the best fit for drying at each tray of the dryer separately. The particle size of cinnamon chips available in the market was having a large range from less than 1 / 8 inches to greater than 6 inches. However about 29. 7 % of cinnamon chips were in the range of 1 inch to 2 inches. The moisture content of cinnamon chips available in the market was found to be within a range of 14. 12 % to 28. 56 % with mean and standard deviation of 19. 97 % and 4. 58 % respectively. The common practice in the industry is to keep the cinnamon chips under wet conditions before drying until a considerable amount is collected. This process seriously affects the oil yield as mould and fungi develops under wet conditions. The maximum number of days in storage under wet conditions without affecting the quality of cinnamon chips was found to be 3 days. The drying behavior of cinnamon <b>chips</b> in a <b>tray</b> dryer had well agreed with the existing drying models for thin layer drying. Considering the total drying time and the oil yield, drying temperature of 35 C was found to be the most suitable temperature for drying of cinnamon chips. Drying at temperatures above 35 C gave lower yield and the high volatile components had escaped during drying operation. Drying was not even within the tray dryer and results of the variation of moisture content at each tray clearly indicated the non-uniform drying behavior. Non-uniform drying had considerably reduced the yield which was significant when the drying temperature was maintained above 35 C.
