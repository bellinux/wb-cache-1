On the basis of the Virial Theorem, he recognized that this transition should be first-order and should, where the phase transition occurs at too low a temperature for atomic diffusion, result in lattice instabilities. At this crossover, these instabilities lead to <b>charge-density</b> <b>waves</b> in single-valent oxides and to phase-fluctuations in mixed-valent oxides.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{theoretically}} study new aspects of charge density waves in transition metal materials recently revealed by {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} measurements. The two important {{problems that we have}} investigated are the effects of orbital degeneracy on the formation of the <b>charge-density</b> <b>waves</b> in cobalt nanowires, and the effects of dilute but strongly pinning impurities on the charge-density wave in niobium diselenide. We first present an overview on <b>charge-density</b> <b>waves,</b> and then introduce a general theoretical model describing <b>charge-density</b> <b>waves.</b> We also explain several known results about disorder effects on <b>charge-density</b> <b>waves.</b> We briefly touch on the principle of scanning tunneling microscopy and its advantages compared to other experimental tools. Second, we discuss the physics of one-dimensional cobalt nanowires along with experimental results. We propose a theoretical model that is relevant to cobalt nanowires, and then analyze the model by two theoretical tools: mean-field theory and bosonization. Our results show that the multi-orbitals allow a spin-triplet interaction among electrons leading to different phase diagrams from the ones considered previously for similar models. Numerical results obtained by first-principles calculations are also briefly explained. Third, we consider the effects of dilute strong impurities on the charge-density wave in niobium diselenide, a transition metal dichalcogenide. We first explain the material and properties of its charge-density wave phase. Then, detailed analysis of a scanning tunneling microscopy measurement is presented. Next, we analytically and numerically study a phenomenological model relevant to the experiment. We show that the dilute strong impurities have little effects at large length scales compared to the average inter-impurity distance, leading to a topologically ordered phase with a (quasi-) long-range autocorrelation; this result is quite different from conventional pictures predicting short-range order with the proliferation of topological defects...|$|E

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the band structure, phonon dispersion, and electron-phonon coupling of three types of small-radius carbon nanotubes (CNTs) : (5, 0), (6, 0), and (5, 5) with diameters 3. 9, 4. 7, and 6. 8 Å respectively. The large curvature of the (5, 0) CNTs makes them metallic with a large density of states at the Fermi energy. The density of states is also strongly enhanced for the (6, 0) CNTs compared to the results obtained from the zone-folding method. For the (5, 5) CNTs the electron-phonon interaction is dominated by the in-plane optical phonons, while for the ultrasmall (5, 0) and (6, 0) CNTs the main coupling is to the out-of-plane optical phonon modes. We calculate electron-phonon interaction strengths for all three types of CNTs and analyze possible instabilities toward superconducting and <b>charge-density</b> <b>wave</b> phases. For the smallest (5, 0) nanotube, in the mean-field approximation and neglecting Coulomb interactions, we find that the <b>charge-density</b> <b>wave</b> transition temperature greatly exceeds the superconducting one. When we include a realistic model of the Coulomb interaction we find that the <b>charge-density</b> <b>wave</b> is suppressed to very low temperatures, making superconductivity dominant with the mean-field transition temperature around one K. For the (6, 0) nanotube the <b>charge-density</b> <b>wave</b> dominates even with the inclusion of Coulomb interactions and we find the mean-field transition temperature to be around five Kelvin.

40|$|Density-wave instabilities {{have been}} {{observed}} and studied in a multitude of materials. Most recently, {{in the context of}} unconventional superconductors like the iron-based superconductors, they have excited considerable interest, since they compete with the superconducting state. We analyze the fluctuation corrections to the equation of state of the density-wave order parameter for commensurate <b>charge-density</b> <b>waves</b> and spin-density waves due to perfect nesting. For XY magnets, we find that contributions due to longitudinal and transverse fluctuations cancel each other, making the mean-field analysis of the problem controlled. This is consistent with the analysis of fluctuation corrections to the BCS theory of superconductivity [S. Kos, A. J. Millis, and A. I. Larkin, Phys. Rev. B 70, 214531 (2004) ]. However, in the case of <b>charge-density</b> <b>waves</b> as well as spin-density waves with Heisenberg symmetry, we find that fluctuation corrections are not negligible, and hence mean-field theories are not justified. These singular fluctuations originate from the intermediate length-scale regime, with wavelengths between the lattice constant and the T= 0 correlation length. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{subjected}} different layered transition-metal dichalcogenides to {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} to reveal the electronic charge distribution associated with the charge-density-wave (CDW) part of the superstructure, {{in addition to the}} atomic corrugation. The observations presented display three regimes ranging from a localized CDW centered around defects or impurities in the case of 1 T-TiS 2, via an intermediate regime governed by overlapping envelope functions in 2 H-NbSe 2, to a fully developed CDW in 1 T-TaSe 2 (as well as in a large number of other compounds). We have obtained strong indication from both direct-space observations and comparison to calculated images based upon the Ginzburg-Landau theory that localized <b>charge-density</b> <b>waves</b> do exist in conjunction with associated lattice distortions. The fact that these observations have been made in solids ranging from (dirty) semiconductor (1 T-TiS 2) to semimetal (1 T-TaSe 2) to metallic (2 H-NbSe 2) points to the general applicability of the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, employed to describe the various regimes in which the formation of <b>charge-density</b> <b>waves</b> and the accompanying periodic lattice distortions appear to act. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of two closely related periodic systems, superconducting rings and <b>charge-density</b> <b>waves,</b> using an approach based on pattern formation. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we concentrate on the onset of instability in a thin superconducting ring. A periodic instability appears when current is driven by an applied external voltage to the point of instability at temperatures below the critical temperature. The main contribution of this study is to investigate how the new state is selected when the system reaches the point of instability. That is, how the selection process is affected by different factors, such as the rate at which the system is driven. In addition, the generation of Ohmic resistance due to the dissipative phase slip state at the point of instability is studied. The problem of state selection at the onset of instability is a generic problem in pattern formation systems. Our results show that the onset of dissipation leads to strong non-linear effects in the state selection process. In the second part of this thesis, we study the nonequilibrium behavior of driven <b>charge-density</b> <b>waves</b> in random media in two spatial dimensions. We propose a novel model for charge-density wave dynamics based on the Swift-Hohenberg equation. The advantage of our model is that it includes both amplitude and phase fluctuations of the condensate. We derive the model and show its formal relation to the almost universally used elastic models for <b>charge-density</b> <b>waves.</b> We demonstrate that phase slips proliferate close to the depinning transition thereby rendering a phase-only description invalid.
