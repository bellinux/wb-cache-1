The theory, according to Waltz (1979), claims to explain the international outcome arising from realpolitik or power politics, namely, the formation <b>of</b> <b>balances</b> <b>of</b> power. Given the close fit between the major developments leading to the eruption of conflict and the principal propositions of balance-of-power theory, {{the outcome of the}} conflict was expected to be consistent with that posited by the theory. This expectation was borne out by the study's finding which indicated that the conflict has produced a similar result. <b>Confirmation</b> <b>of</b> the theory was achieved by further subjecting the finding to the verification test established by Waltz...|$|R

This paper describes the automation of PCR for the laboratory <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> meningococcal disease and the typing of meningococcal isolates using DNA sequencing. Both methods have been automated using a robotic liquid handler and automated DNA sequencer.
