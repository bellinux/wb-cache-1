40|$|Master thesis "European {{cultural}} lobby. Case of We Are More campaign" is {{analyzing the}} European lobbying {{in the cultural}} domain. As an area of European policies, culture has been established continuously since the 80 's of the 20 th century. The role that culture gained at the European Union (EU) level is specific by its double dimension. At the same time, culture {{is perceived as a}} source of common values and an area with high economic potential. This thesis examines whether the exclusive role of culture within the EU signifies specific features of lobbying in the cultural domain. Theoretical part of this work is using the concept of europeanization in order to explain how culture became an area of European public policy. The same part develops the theory of European lobbying to demonstrate division of the EU interest groups into public and private. Second part of this thesis presents the case study of the nowadays biggest European cultural lobby, <b>Culture</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Europe,</b> and We Are More campaign organized by this lobby in order to influence future European framework programmes for culture and audiovisual in 2014 - 2020 period. Features that decide whether an interest group is public or private, as defined by the theoretical part of this thesis, are studied on the case of <b>Culture</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Europe.</b> In order to [...] ...|$|E

" Two models of cultural influence are developed, for settled and unsettled cultural periods. In settled periods, <b>culture</b> independently influences <b>action,</b> but only by providing resources from which people can construct diverse lines of action. In unsettled cultural periods, explicit ideologies directly govern action, but structural opportunities for action determine which among competing ideologies survive in the long run. This alternative view of culture offers new opportunities for systematic, differentiated arguments about culture's causal role in shaping action. The reigning model used to understand <b>culture's</b> effects on <b>action</b> is fundamentally misleading.
