This process, referred to as peptide stapling, uses non-natural amino acids to facilitate macrocyclization by ring-closing olefin metathesis. In this case, a stapled BH3 helix was identified which specifically activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by antagonizing the sequestration of BH3-only proteins by anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g. Bcl-2, see also intrinsic and extrinsic inducers of the apoptosis). This molecule suppressed growth of human leukemia in a mouse xenograft model.|$|R

5000|$|In 2012, Yu and <b>co-workers</b> <b>reported</b> <b>a</b> {{pioneering}} meta-selective C-H olefination using nitrile-containing templates {{to deliver}} the palladium to the meta-position via a macrocyclic cyclophane-like pre-transition state. The nitrile group is tethered to the aromatic ring by a removable linker. It coordinates weakly to palladium in an “end-on” fashion, which refers to the linear structure of C-CN-Pd bonds. The linear coordination is proposed to help overcome the high strain in the cyclophane-like pre-transition state that brings palladium to {{the vicinity of the}} meta-hydrogen. The template is designed as such that the flat arene linker keeps the substrate aromatic ring and the nitrile group coplanar. Bulky substituents on the arene linker “lock” the nitrile tether in the desired position. The delicate design results in high regioselectivity towards the meta-C-H bond. The templates can be removed easily to give toluene derivatives or hydrocinnamic acid derivatives in high yield.|$|R

30|$|Organic-inorganic hybrid {{perovskite}} {{materials have}} attracted enormous research interest {{because of their}} excellent properties. These properties include low material cost, compatible with solution processing, superior carrier mobility, and tunable optical bandgap [1 – 5]. At the same time, perovskite materials have a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) [6 – 9]. These characters make perovskite materials become the promising candidates for information display and solid-state lighting source compared to organic light-emitting diodes [10, 11] and provide the premise for low-cost and roll-to-roll fabrication. In 2014, Friend and <b>co-workers</b> firstly <b>reported</b> <b>a</b> new perovskite light-emitting diode (PeLED) based on solution-processing organometal halide perovskite with a sandwich structure. In green PeLEDs, a maximum luminance of 364  cd m− 2 and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.1 % were obtained [12]. Since then, many significant works {{have been carried out}} to study PeLEDs. In 2015, Tae-Woo Lee and co-workers boosted the current efficiency (CE) of PeLEDs to 42.9  cd A− 1 by increasing the proportion of methylammonium bromide in perovskite precursor solution and using nanocrystalline pinning-process method in the process of spin-coating perovskite [13].
