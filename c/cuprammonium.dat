25|$|It {{was clear}} by 1909–10 that viscose, with its cheaper raw {{materials}} and simpler spinning process, was economically superior to <b>cuprammonium.</b>|$|E
25|$|J. P. Bemberg and VGF {{organized}} the American Bemberg Corporation in 1925, and began making rayon using the <b>cuprammonium</b> process in October 1926 at a newly built facility near Elizabethton, Tennessee, nine miles from Johnson City, Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|Around 1911 VGF {{began to}} invest in J. P. Bemberg, a cloth dying and {{finishing}} company that had been experimenting with {{a version of the}} <b>cuprammonium</b> process, and encouraged Bemberg to focus on producing yarns for which that process was suitable.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cuprammonium</b> rayon is a rayon {{made from}} {{cellulose}} dissolved in <b>cuprammonium</b> solution.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cuprammonium</b> rayon has {{properties}} {{similar to}} viscose but during production, the cellulose {{is combined with}} copper and ammonia (Schweizer's reagent). Due to the environmental effects of this production method, <b>cuprammonium</b> rayon is no longer produced in the United States.|$|E
50|$|As already {{mentioned}} the closely related Schweizer's reagent {{is used for}} the production of <b>cuprammonium</b> rayon.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{economic}} success of <b>cuprammonium</b> rayon (tenfold increase of annual production, sixfold increase of turnover, fivefold increase of manpower by 1912), the future {{belonged to the}} viscose process invented in England. In 1911, Glanzstoff acquired the viscose patent which advanced to production line status in Oberbruch. The original <b>cuprammonium</b> rayon was completely withdrawn in 1916. During the First World War Oberbruch was the only Glanzstoff plant to continue production at a limited level despite declining demand {{and a lack of}} labour.|$|E
50|$|Schweizer's reagent is an {{alkaline}} solution of copper sulfate in ammonia, Cu(NH3)4(OH)2-3H2O, or CuH14N4O2.Schweizer's reagent may be prepared by covering technical grade, stabilized Copper(II) hydroxide with ammonium hydroxide.It {{was the basis}} for the process patented in 1890 by the French chemist Louis-Henri Despeissis for making fibers from <b>cuprammonium</b> rayon.He extruded the <b>cuprammonium</b> solution of cellulose into water, then used dilute sulfuric acid to neutralize the ammonia and precipitate the cellulose fibers.Despeissis died in 1892 and his patent was not renewed.|$|E
5000|$|By 1909-10 it {{was evident}} that the viscose process was superior, and VGF began to convert to viscose production.However, {{although}} <b>cuprammonium</b> rayon was more expensive than viscose rayon, with Edmund Thiele's [...] "stretch-spinning" [...] process it was possible to make rayon with fine filaments of 1-1.5 denier.Cuprophan, a cellulose membrane based on the process, was being used in dialyzers after World War II (1939-45).As late as 2001 Asahi Chemical Industries of Nobeoka, Japan, was using the <b>cuprammonium</b> process to manufacture rayon.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1911 VGF {{began to}} invest in J. P. Bemberg, a cloth dying and {{finishing}} company that had been experimenting with {{a version of the}} <b>cuprammonium</b> process, and encouraged Bemberg to focus on producing yarns for which that process was suitable.Bemberg was using the [...] "stretch-spinning" [...] process invented by the chemist Edmund Thiele (1867-1927) to make <b>cuprammonium</b> rayon with equally fine filaments to the artificial silk of Hilaire de Chardonnet (1839-1924),and with better physical properties. The VGF product was not competitive.Although Thiele had applied for a patent on his process, a German court ruled on 4 May 1907 that it had been anticipated by the [...] "Pauly" [...] patent.|$|E
5000|$|In 1892, the {{two were}} {{successful}} in producing filaments in substantial quantities by precipitating cellulose from solution in <b>cuprammonium</b> hydroxide (copper(II) oxide dissolved in aqueous ammonia/sodium hydroxide). At first, the <b>cuprammonium</b> rayon was used as incandescent filament in light bulb production. An improved process refined the first rough and uneven filament to increase its strength and elasticity. This would enable the spinning of a material that compared to silk. In 1897, Fremery and Urban applied for a patent for their method. In {{the history of the}} textile industry, the so-called [...] "Pauly Patent" [...] is considered as the beginning of German rayon production. Although bulb production was discontinued in 1902, rayon production advanced on an industrial scale.|$|E
50|$|J. P. Bemberg {{began to}} produce {{artificial}} textile fiber commercially using the <b>cuprammonium</b> process in 1897.The company went public as J. P. Bemberg AG in 1903.In 1901 Dr Edmund Thiele developed a stretch-spinning system for J. P. Bemberg, which began to produce fine-filament artificial silk under the Bemberg® trademark in 1908.With this process J. P. Bemberg {{was able to}} make rayon using the <b>cuprammonium</b> process with filaments of 1-1.5 denier, comparable to Chardonnet silk and physically superior.The process did not have the flammability problems of Hilaire de Chardonnet's process, but could not compete with the viscose process except where very fine filament was needed. Costs were higher than with viscose rayon due to the need to use copper salts and cotton for the cellulose.|$|E
50|$|In 1857 the Swiss chemist Matthias Eduard Schweizer (1818-60) {{found that}} cotton could be {{dissolved}} {{in a solution}} of copper salts and ammonia and then regenerated.In 1890 the French chemist Louis Henri Despeissis invented the <b>cuprammonium</b> process for spinning fibers from cotton dissolved in Schweizer's reagent.Despeissis died in 1892 and his patent was not renewed.|$|E
50|$|George Audemars first {{manufactured}} regenerated nitrocellulose fibers in 1855. Though these fibers were {{soft and}} strong -resembling silk- {{they had the}} drawback of being highly flammable. Hilaire de Chardonnet perfected production of nitrocellulose fibers, but manufacturing of these fibers was relatively uneconomical. In 1890, L.H. Despeissis invented the <b>cuprammonium</b> process -which uses a <b>cuprammonium</b> solution to solubilize cellulose- a method still used today for production of artificial silk. In 1891, {{it was discovered that}} treatment of cellulose with alkali and carbon disulfide generated a soluble cellulose derivative known as viscose. This process, patented by the founders of the Viscose Development Company, is the most widely used method for manufacturing regenerated cellulose products. Courtaulds purchased the patents for this process in 1904, leading to significant growth of viscose fiber production. By 1931, expiration of patents for the viscose process led to its adoption worldwide. Global production of regenerated cellulose fiber peaked in 1973 at 3,856,000 tons.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: When a {{solution}} of cellulose in <b>cuprammonium</b> hydroxide comes into contact with sulfuric acid, the cellulose begins to precipitate from the solution. The sulfuric acid reacts with a complex compound of copper and dissolves it. Thin blue fibers of rayon are formed. After some time, sulfuric acid reacts with the complex compound and washes out the copper salts from the fibers. The fibers become colorless.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} {{developed by}} Thiele for Bemberg {{was used in}} Italy by Bemberg SpA of Gozzano in 1924 and in France by Le Cupro textile of Rennes.Manufacturing of <b>cuprammonium</b> yarn began at British Bemberg in Doncaster, UK, in 1926. The firm was sequestrated by the British government in 1939.In 1928 the technology was licensed to Asahi Bemberg of Nobeoka, Japan.Asahi Kasei started operations at the newly built Bemberg factory in Nobeoka in 1931, and made its first shipment on 27 June 1931.By 1970 {{a total of four}} plants were producing rayon with the <b>cuprammonium</b> process.J.P. Bemberg in Wuppertal produced 27 tonnes/day; Beaunit Fibers in Elizabethton produced 25 tonnes/day; Bemberg SpA in Gozzano produced 14 tonnes/day and Asahi Chemical Industries Co in Nobeoka produced 80 tonnes/day.By 2000 only Asahi was still producing rayon in this way.By May 2011 Bemberg SpA was insolvent and the city of Gozzano was struggling to find purchasers for the real estate and machinery.As of 2015 Asahi Kasei Fibers Corporation was still producing rayon under the Bemberg™ brand.|$|E
5000|$|The Swiss chemist Matthias Eduard Schweizer (1818-1860) {{discovered}} that cellulose dissolved in tetraaminecopper dihydroxide. Max Fremery and Johann Urban developed {{a method to}} produce carbon fibers for use in light bulbs in 1897. Production of <b>cuprammonium</b> rayon for textiles started in 1899 in the Vereinigte Glanzstoff Fabriken AG in Oberbruch near Aachen. [...] Improvement by the J. P. Bemberg AG in 1904 made the artificial silk a product comparable to real silk.|$|E
50|$|It is {{produced}} by making cellulose a soluble compound by combining it with copper and ammonia. The solution of this material in caustic soda is passed through the spinneret and the cellulose is regenerated in the hardening baths that remove the copper and ammonia and neutralize the caustic soda. <b>Cuprammonium</b> rayon is usually made in fine filaments {{that are used in}} lightweight summer dresses and blouses, sometimes in combination with cotton to make textured fabrics with slubbed, uneven surfaces.|$|E
50|$|Bemberg {{founded a}} factory using Thiele's process at Ölde, near Barmen (now part of Wuppertal).Around 1911 Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken (VGF) began {{to invest in}} J. P. Bemberg, and {{encouraged}} Bemberg to focus on producing yarns for which that process was suitable.In 1916 VGF and Bemberg agreed to exchange technology, and from that time VGF concentrated on viscose production and left <b>cuprammonium</b> to Bemberg.Full-scale production only began after this.Bemberg's production of rayon rose from 440 tonnes in 1922 to 3,468 tonnes in 1935.|$|E
50|$|Attack {{takes the}} form of a {{reaction}} between ammonia and copper to form the <b>cuprammonium</b> ion, formula Cu(NH3)42+, a chemical complex which is water-soluble, and hence washed from the growing cracks. So the problem of cracking can also occur in copper and any other copper alloy, such as bronze. The tendency of copper to react with ammonia was exploited in making rayon, and the deep blue colour of the aqueous solution of copper(II) oxide in ammonia is known as Schweizer's reagent.|$|E
5000|$|Taffeta ( [...] ; archaically spelled taffety) is a crisp, smooth, plain {{woven fabric}} made from silk or <b>cuprammonium</b> rayons. The word is Persian in origin and means [...] "twisted woven". It is {{considered}} to be a [...] "high-end" [...] fabric, suitable for use in ball gowns, wedding dresses, and in interior decoration for curtains or wallcoverings. It is also widely used in the manufacture of corsets and corsetry: it yields a more starched-like type of cloth that holds its shape better than many other fabrics. An extremely thin, crisp type of taffeta is called paper taffeta.|$|E

In 1892 they founded an incandescent electric lamp manufacturing company, Rheinische Glühlampenfabrik in Oberbruch, in the Heinsberg district. The Solingen merchant Hermann Heuser and Fremery's family subscribed the initial capital of 300,000 marks. Fremery and Urban manufactured their lamp filaments using cotton and Schweizer's reagent.|$|E
5000|$|The {{solubility}} of nitrocellulose {{in organic}} solvents such as ether and acetone {{was the basis}} for the first [...] "artificial silk" [...] by Georges Audemars in about 1855. Commercial production started in 1891, but the result was flammable and more expensive than cellulose acetate or <b>cuprammonium</b> rayon. Because of this expense, production ceased early in the 1900s. Nitrocellulose was briefly known as [...] "mother-in-law silk". Frank Hastings Griffin invented the double-godet, a special stretch-spinning process that changed artificial silk to rayon, rendering it usable in many industrial products such as tire cords and clothing. Nathan Rosenstein invented the [...] "spunize process" [...] by which he turned rayon from a hard fiber to a fabric. This allowed rayon to become a popular raw material in textiles.|$|E
50|$|In April 1925 Fritz Blüthgen of VGF, {{suggested}} {{a joint venture}} with Courtaulds in the United States.When Courtaulds declined, VGF entered the US market in competition with Courtaulds.J.

There were ongoing labor problems, starting with a strike in March 1929, but the plants operated profitably throughout the Great Depression.|$|E
5000|$|Fremery and Urban became {{involved}} in developing synthetic fiber (Glanzstoff) in the mid-1890s.The success of the nitrocellulose fiber developed by Hilaire de Chardonnet encouraged Fremery and Urban to investigate making artificial silk, which they named [...] "Silkimit" [...] and patented in 1897.Their <b>cuprammonium</b> process was cheaper and safer than nitrocellulose.The company had developed a process by 1897 that used rotating cylinders to stretch the fibers into finer filaments {{that could be used}} for making clothes.They patented a version of the Despeissis process with the addition of a practical method for spinning the fiber.In Oberbruch in 1898 they established the first factory in Germany to economically produce artificial fiber, using a patent for manufacture of rayon made from cellulose in a copper-ammonia solution.The workforce had grown to 700 people within one year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Plasma /? 2 -M was {{measured}} by radio-immunoassay in samples obtained before and after dialysis with seven different dialysers, tested according to the protocol of the International Cooperative Biocompatibility Study (ICBS). Plasma /J 2 -M was cor-rected for contraction of its distribution volume, which {{was assumed to be}} equal to the extracellular fluid volume. The uncorrected plasma /? 2 -M concentration increased with all conventional dialysers, including the G 10 - 3 N, (<b>cuprammonium</b> cellulose plate), G 120 M (<b>cuprammonium</b> cellulose hollow fibre), CD 4000 (cel-lulose acetate) and T 150 (polymethylmethacrylate). However, {{no significant differences were found}} between the predialysis and the corrected postdialysis plasma /? 2 -M concentrations with these conventional dialysers, and thus no evidence of net generation or release of P 2 -M was found in this study. With high-permeability membranes, the corrected postdialysis /? 2 -M values were decreased by 27. 1 % with the Duo-Flux® Artificial Kidney, 53. 5 % with F 60, and 34. 6 % with Filtral, indicating that dialysers with these membranes eliminate plasma /? 2 -M to a certain extent. The complex of granulocyte elastase with arantipro-teinase in plasma was also measured in samples from the arterial blood line collected before, and after 30 and 120 min of dialysis with each of the seven dialysers in this study. All dialysers elicited an increase in the mean plasma elastase concentrations which was more than twice as high with <b>cuprammonium</b> cellulose plate than with all of the others. The change of elastase at 120 min of dialysis varied considerably with each dia-lyser and was statistically significant with all except CD 4000, F 60, and Filtral.
