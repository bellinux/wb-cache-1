5|$|Banksia integrifolia, {{commonly}} known as coast banksia, is a species of tree that grows along {{the east coast of}} Australia. One of the most widely distributed Banksia species, it occurs between Victoria and Central Queensland in a broad range of habitats, from <b>coastal</b> <b>dunes</b> to mountains. It is highly variable in form, but is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (82ft) in height. Its leaves have dark green upper surfaces and white undersides, a contrast that can be striking on windy days.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa {{occurs on}} <b>coastal</b> <b>dunes</b> and sandplains in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia, from East Mount Barren in the Fitzgerald River National Park and the {{vicinity}} of Hopetoun eastwards to Israelite Bay, generally within 50km (31mi) of the coast. The range extends inland to Mount Ragged and 25km (16mi) southwest of Grass Patch. There is an outlying population to the east at Point Culver on the Great Australian Bight.|$|E

5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the <b>coastal</b> <b>dunes,</b> where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid, lesser centaury and carline thistle flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare Jersey cudweed and grey hair-grass are also found. The narrow 5-km (3-mi) belt of pines shelters creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest.|$|E
5|$|Phallus hadriani is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and thus}} obtains nutrients by decomposing organic matter. In North America, {{it is commonly}} associated with tree stumps, or roots of stumps that are decomposing in the ground. In Great Britain, its distribution {{is more or less}} restricted to <b>coastal</b> <b>dunes,</b> while in Poland, it has been noted to avoid humid and humic forest soils, and live in symbiosis with xerophilous grasses and the black locust tree, Robinia pseudoacacia.

5|$|Sufficient habitat {{complexity}} is {{a crucial}} requirement {{for the presence of}} this species, in order to support its various behaviours-basking, foraging, and hibernation—as well as to offer some protection from predators and human harassment. It is found in a variety of habitats, including: chalky downs, rocky hillsides, moors, sandy heaths, meadows, rough commons, edges of woods, sunny glades and clearings, bushy slopes and hedgerows, dumps, <b>coastal</b> <b>dunes,</b> and stone quarries. It will venture into wetlands if dry ground is available nearby and thus may be found on the banks of streams, lakes, and ponds.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of European {{settlement}} the river was a summertime chain of waterholes bounded by large gum trees. Flowing through {{the area where the}} city of Adelaide is sited the river was sometimes invisible beneath its gravel stream bed. It frequently flooded in winter and did not reach the sea, instead ending at <b>coastal</b> <b>dunes</b> where its waters created a vast but shallow freshwater wetlands. These wetlands, known as The Reedbeds after the dominant vegetation, occupied a large area of the western Adelaide Plains and were also fed by other waterways. The river only flowed to the sea through the Port River, Barker Inlet, and Patawalonga River following heavy rain.Try: http://www.amlrnrm.sa.gov.au/Caring_for_Water_Seas/Creeks_Rivers/River_Torrens.aspx Retrieved on 9 September 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the park}} includes many communities of a Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean type: warm oak forests with undergrowth of evergreen sclerophyll shrubs, such as tree heath (Erica arborea), butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus), Rose of Sharon (Hypericum calycinum), green olive tree (Phillyrea latifolia), Cistus incanus, sage-leaved rock rose (Cistus salvifolius), among others. The xerothermic grasslands along the coast and in some areas to the west {{of the park}} have replaced forests destroyed by human activity. The most widespread floral communities of that type are dominated by Chrysopogon gryllus, Bothriochloa ischaemum and bulbous bluegrass (Poa bulbosa). The <b>coastal</b> <b>dunes</b> are home to psammophytic vegetation. The river banks are covered with dense forests of black alder (Alnus glutinosa), white willow (Salix alba) and crack willow (Salix fragilis).|$|E

40|$|A {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} analysis was performed for 570 quartz grains from desert and <b>coastal</b> <b>dune</b> sands in NW Mexico. Our main goal is to present a new application {{in the use of}} ternary diagrams with logistic normal confidence region boundaries of normalized data based on quartz surface textures (i. e., constrained data) of desert and <b>coastal</b> <b>dune</b> sands. This was done to demonstrate that quartz surface textures from desert and <b>coastal</b> <b>dune</b> sands are not significantly different even though there are apparent dominant processes (mechanical, chemical) that produce different surface textures in quartz grains from both dune types. This may be associated with the fact that quartz grains deposited in the dune sands do not reflect a second cycle of transport associated with an aeolian environment because of their low textural maturity, provenance, closeness to the source rock, and little attrition process. This study indicates that quartz grains from the desert dunes display mechanical textures probably associated with the Colorado River Delta and granitic sources that do not reflect accurately the aeolian mechanisms controlling the transport of these grains. Also, some quartz grains display chemical surface textures probably linked to the hydrothermal activity near the Colorado River Delta. In general, quartz grains display conspicuous surface textures. Quartz from <b>coastal</b> <b>dune</b> sands displays chemical surface textures that indicate quartz precipitation from silica-saturated water and, to a lesser extent, it displays mechanical features. These similarities might be associated with the mixing of processes (mechanical, chemical) in quartz from the desert and <b>coastal</b> <b>dune</b> sands...|$|R
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass have an {{important}} function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the <b>coastal</b> <b>dunes,</b> where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass help to bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird's-foot trefoil and pyramidal orchid are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised mosses and lichens are found on the dunes, and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 lichen species. The plant distribution {{is influenced by the}} dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as calcium carbonate from animal shells is leached out of the sand to be replaced by more acidic humus from plant decomposition products. Marram grass is particularly discouraged by the change in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with mosses and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in dune stabilization, since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. The moss and lichen flora of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. Non-native tree lupins have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{within a}} coastal plain, the St. Johns River passes through {{an area that}} was at one time barrier islands, <b>coastal</b> <b>dunes,</b> and estuary marshes. The Florida Peninsula was created {{primarily}} by forces and minerals from the ocean. It lies so low that minor fluctuations in sea levels can have a dramatic effect on its geomorphology. Florida was once part of the supercontinent Gondwana. Lying underneath the visible rock formations is a basement of igneous granite and volcanic composition under a sedimentary layer formed during the Paleozoic era 542 to 251 million years ago. During the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 million years ago), the basement and its sedimentary overlay were further covered by calcium carbonate and formations left by the evaporation of water called evaporites. What covers the peninsula {{is the result of}} simultaneous processes of deposits of sands, shells, and coral, and erosion from water and weather. As ocean water has retreated and progressed, the peninsula has been covered with sea water at least seven times. Waves compressed sands, calcium carbonate, and shells into limestone; at the ocean's edge, beach ridges were created by this depositional forming. North-south axis rivers, such as the St. Johns, were created by past beach ridges which were often divided by swales. As ocean water retreated, lagoons formed in the swales, which were further eroded by acidic water. Barrier islands, furthermore, formed along the Atlantic Coast, surrounding the lagoon with land and forming a freshwater river.|$|E
