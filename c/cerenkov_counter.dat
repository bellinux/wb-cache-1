50|$|The Gamma-1 {{telescope}} {{was the main}} telescope. It consisted of 2 scintillation counters and a gas <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>counter.</b> With an effective area of around 0.2 m2, it operated in the energy range of 50 MeV to 6 GeV. At 100 MeV it initially had an angular resolution of 1.5 degrees, with a field of view of 5 degrees and an energy resolution of 12%. A Telezvezda star tracker increased the pointing position accuracy of the Gamma-1 telescope to 2 arcminutes by tracking stars up to an apparent magnitude of 5 within its 6 by 6 degree field of view. However, due {{to the failure of}} power to a spark chamber, for most of the mission the resolution was around 10 degrees.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the HEAO C-3 {{experiment}} was to measure the charge spectrum of cosmic-ray nuclei over the nuclear charge (Z) range from 17 to 120, in the energy interval 0.3 to 10 GeV/nucleon; to characterize cosmic ray sources; processes of nucleosynthesis, and propagation modes. The detector consisted of a double-ended instrument of upper and lower hodoscopes and three dual-gap ion chambers. The two ends were separated by a Cerenkov radiater. The geometrical factor was 4 sq cm-sr. The ion chambers could resolve charge to 0.24 charge units at low energy and 0.39 charge units at high energy and high Z. The <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>counter</b> could resolve 0.3 to 0.4 charge units. Binns et al. give more details.The experiment was proposed and managed by the Space Radiation Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), {{under the direction of}} Principal Investigator Prof. Edward C.

40|$|The mass {{resolution}} attainable with cosmic ray telescopes employing Cerenkov counters for {{velocity measurement}} was examined. It is shown {{that in most}} cases, the limiting mass resolution {{is determined by the}} resolution of the <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>counter.</b> The resolution achieved in the UNH telescope flown on a balloon in 1977 is studied as a function of charge and energy. This telescope determines the mass using the Cerenkov x total energy technique. It is shown that the mass resolution for heavier nuclei can be accurately predicted using the response of the <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>counter</b> to sea level mu-mesons. The actual in flight resolution for heavier nuclei, including broadening effects, may be predicted using the beta = 1 Cerenkov distributions, and independently by studying the distribution function of the differences of the two banks of photomultipliers employed on each <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>counter...</b>|$|E

Part of a unique open geometry detector package known as the Big Electron Telescope Array, this <b>Čerenkov</b> <b>counter</b> served to identify scattered electrons and reject produced pions in an inclusive scattering experiment known as the Spin Asymmetries of the Nucleon Experiment E 07 - 003 at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) also known as Jefferson Lab. The experiment consisted of a measurement of double spin asymmetries A_∥ and A_ of a polarized electron beam impinging on a polarized ammonia target.
