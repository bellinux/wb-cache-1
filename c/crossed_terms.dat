Lett. 107, 114301 (2011) ] only considered the contribution from the electric dipole moment. For metal particles, however, the magnetic dipole moment due to eddy current plays an important role, which can further couple with the electric dipole moment to introduce <b>crossed</b> <b>terms.</b> In this work, we develop coupled electric and magnetic dipole (CEMD) approach for the {{radiative heat transfer}} {{in a collection of}} objects in mutual interaction. Due to the coupled electric and magnetic interactions, four terms, namely the electric-electric, the electric-magnetic, the magnetic-electric and the magnetic-magnetic terms, contribute to the radiative heat flux and the local energy density. The CEMD is applied to study the radiative heat transfer between various dimers of nanoparticles. It is found that each of the four terms can dominate the radiative heat transfer depending on the position and composition of particles. Moreover, near-field many-body interactions are studied by CEMD considering both dielectric and metallic nanoparticles. The near-field radiative heat flux and local energy density can be greatly increased when the particles are in coupled resonances.

This was achieved in the temperature range 1. 2 to 4. 2  K which includes the critical temperature Tc= 1. 8  K, with an applied magnetic field up to 9 Teslas. The results are the following. i) The velocity shows an anisotropic bahaviour. It depends on the angle between {{the field and the}} acoustic wavevector. ii) The initial slope of the velocity versus the square of the magnetic field which measures a non-linear magneto-elastic coefficient presents a very rapid variation (a jump) at Tc. iii) Below Tc the velocity presents a minimum, whereas the attenuation has a maximum for H around 1 T. iv) Above Tc the velocity shows a complicated behaviour : a maximum followed by a minimum and finally an increase with the field. v) For high fields the velocity increases with the field, the lower the temperature the steeper the slope, and a trend towards saturation is observed at the lowest temperatures for the highest fields. In the same field range the attenuation decreases with the field. All these data are interpreted {{within the framework of the}} static Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model including two spin-strain coupling mechanisms : a Waller mechanism and a field induced mechanism.

40|$|Many {{traditional}} Information Retrieval (IR) models {{assume that}} query terms {{are independent of}} each other. For those models, a document is normally represented as a bag of words/terms and their frequencies. Although traditional retrieval models can achieve reasonably good performance in many applications, the corresponding independence assumption has limitations. There are some recent studies that investigate how to model term associations/dependencies by proximity measures. However, the modeling of term associations theoretically under the probabilistic retrieval framework is still largely unexplored. In this thesis, I propose a new concept named <b>Cross</b> <b>Term,</b> to model term proximity, {{with the aim of}} boosting retrieval performance. With <b>Cross</b> <b>Terms,</b> the association of multiple query terms can be modeled {{in the same way as}} a simple unigram term. In particular, an occurrence of a query term is assumed to have an impact on its neighboring text. The degree of the query term impact gradually weakens with increasing distance from the place of occurrence. Shape functions are used to characterize such impacts. Based on this assumption, I first propose a bigram <b>CRoss</b> <b>TErm</b> Retrieval (CRTER 2) model for probabilistic IR and a Language model based model CRTER 2 LM. Specifically, a bigram <b>Cross</b> <b>Term</b> occurs when the corresponding query terms appear close to each other, and its impact can be modeled by the intersection of the respective shape functions of the query terms. Second, I propose a generalized n-gram <b>CRoss</b> <b>TErm</b> Retrieval (CRTERn) model recursively for n query terms where n> 2. For n-gram <b>Cross</b> <b>Term,</b> I develop several distance metrics with different properties and employ them in the proposed models for ranking. Third, an enhanced context-sensitive proximity model is proposed to boost the CRTER models, where the contextual relevance of term proximity is studied. The models are validated on several large standard data sets, and show improved performance over other state-of-art approaches. I also discusse the practical impact of the proposed models. The approaches in this thesis can also provide helpful benefit for term association modeling in other domains...|$|R
