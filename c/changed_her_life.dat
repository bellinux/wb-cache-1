500|$|She {{attended}} North High School in Phoenix, {{where she}} was active in school plays. She stated that her biggest influence as a teenager was her teacher Bud Brown, whose lectures about the Civil Rights Movement, poverty, the free press, and anti-semitism in Europe [...] "absolutely inflamed" [...] her and <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> Brown was later investigated as a Communist. She went to Dominican College, an all-girls Catholic institution in San Rafael, California for a year before transferring to the University of Arizona in 1948. She stopped acting in college because her father refused to support her in that career. She chose Education, {{even though she was}} not interested in becoming a teacher, on the recommendation of her mother and because as she later stated, [...] "It was something that girls of my generation did because teaching was acceptable".|$|E
500|$|She took a {{position}} at Camp Tera, a [...] "She-She-She" [...] conservation camp established {{at the urging of}} First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to parallel the male Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps formed under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal to provide employment to young adults while improving infrastructure. During her three months at the camp, Murray's health recovered and she met Eleanor Roosevelt, which would later lead to correspondence that <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> Murray clashed with the camp's director, however. He found a Marxist book from her Hunter College course among Murray's belongings, questioned Murray's stance during the First Lady's visit, and disapproved of her cross-racial relationship with Peg Holmes, a white counselor. Murray and Holmes left the camp in February 1935, and began traveling the country by walking, hitchhiking, and hopping freight trains. Murray later worked for the Young Women's Christian Association.|$|E

500|$|On Good Friday in March 2005, Veitch, Albee and {{six other}} women went to a strip club in Riverside and paid for lap dances. Instead of {{accepting}} the dances, they talked with the strippers, telling {{them that they were}} loved and accepted by God, that churches were composed entirely of sinners, and that they would be welcome there. One of the lap dancers cried and told Albee she had often wanted to go to a church but had never done so because she had thought that she would be rejected. The woman accepted a prayer from Albee and hugged her. Albee would later say that talking with women at the strip club that first day <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> Because the volunteers received more positive responses than they had expected, they decided to continue to evangelize at strip clubs. To organize these activities, Veitch and Albee founded JC's Girls, with [...] "JC" [...] standing for Jesus Christ. They made Matthew's House the parent organization, but decided to operate primarily under the name [...] "JC's Girls" [...] because Veitch believed that strippers would not understand the meaning of the name [...] "Matthew's House".|$|E
500|$|The Ramones {{began playing}} gigs in mid-1974, {{with their first}} show at Performance Studios in New York City. The band, {{performing}} in a style {{similar to the one}} used on their debut album, typically performed at clubs in downtown Manhattan, specifically CBGB and Max's Kansas City. In early 1975, Lisa Robinson, an editor of Hit Parader and Rock Scene, saw the fledgling Ramones performing at CBGB and subsequently wrote about the band in several magazine issues. The group's vocalist Joey Ramone related that [...] "Lisa came down to see us, she was blown away by us. She said that we <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>life,</b> She started writing about us in Rock Scene, and then Lenny Kaye would write about us and we started getting more press like The Village Voice. Word was getting out, and people starting coming down." [...] Convinced that the band needed a recording contract, Robinson contacted Danny Fields, former manager of the Stooges, and argued that he needed to manage the band. Fields agreed because the band [...] "had everything [...] ever liked," [...] and became the manager in November 1975.|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{described}} Irresistibles {{material as}} [...] "Mariah Carey meets Britney Spears ... very mature but accessible to teens." [...] She {{said that she}} wanted to blend house, R, pop genres into the record. The opening track, [...] "Irresistible", is an R song with dance-pop influences. It also exhibits elements of pop rock and funk genres, while incorporating latin rhythms. Aside from including a string section, the track features Simpson's breathy vocals, spoken passages and a mid-section breakdown, where her vocals are [...] "funk-fortified". According to author Ben Graham, the lyrics of the song see Simpson stripping her famous virginity image down. Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In gave a similar observation of the lyrics, writing that they point to an imminent sexual compromise. [...] "A Little Bit" [...] is a dance-pop song following the same beat-oriented pattern as [...] "Irresistible". It features piano instrumentation and Simpson sings the lyrics as rapid-fire verses and with start-and-stop hooks. Simpson again adopts breathy vocals, and the lyrics talk about what she expects from her partner: [...] "A little more time, a little less wait / A little more heart, a little less break". The lyrics also demand healthy changes in her relationship. [...] "Forever In Your Eyes" [...] explores elements of Latin music, as the song is backed by Spanish guitar and infused with hip-hop beats. The lyrics describe a couple in love lying together [...] "all through the night". [...] "There You Were" [...] is a torchy power ballad which drew comparisons to Simpson's previous song [...] "Where You Are" [...] (2000). The lyrics of the song are a homage to the protagonist's partner, who <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> The song received negative response from critics, with some calling it [...] "sappy" [...] and [...] "unnecessary". [...] "What's It Gonna Be" [...] is a bubblegum pop song influenced by '80s funk music, which was compared to outtakes from Spears' Oops!... I Did It Again (2000). The lyrics deal with Simpson expecting a reply from her lover regarding his fear of commitment.|$|E

2500|$|Abramović {{said the}} show <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> [...] "completely – every {{possible}} element, every physical emotion," [...] and that Lady Gaga saw it helped boost her popularity: [...] "So {{the kids from}} 12 and 14 years old to about 18, the public who normally don't go to the museum, who don't {{give a shit about}} performance art or don't even know what it is, started coming because of Lady Gaga. And they saw the show and then they started coming back. And that's how I get a whole new audience." [...] In September 2011, a video game version of Abramović's performance was released by Pippin Barr.|$|E
2500|$|In {{describing}} the affiliated celebrity members of Scientology, the documentary refers {{to them as}} an [...] "all-star cast list". John Travolta is seen crediting the longevity of his career and demise of other people's careers as due to the influence or lack of influence of Dianetics. The documentary moves onto an interview in which Sweeney talks with a mother, known as [...] "Sharon", who had been [...] "disconnected" [...] from her daughter after her daughter had taken a weekend away with other Scientologists and had read several books which she claimed had <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> Sweeney then explains {{the concept of a}} [...] "disconnection" [...] within the context of Scientology doctrine. [...] "To the church, Sharon was a negative influence. Her daughter wrote to her cutting all ties. It's what Scientology call a 'disconnect'. [...] They say they bring families together and a disconnect is a rare last resort and a human right." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Kurt Cobain's biographer Christopher Sandford, Nirvana singer gave [...] "specific references" [...] when {{recording}} {{their first}} album Bleach: [...] "the guitar part in [...] "Love Buzz" [...] was lifted from Sparks’ Kimono My House". Björk talked about Kimono my House {{as one of}} the records that <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> [...] " [...] were exotic , [...] were the most refreshing thing in my life" [...] when she was eight. [...] "I loved the way Russell Mael sung like a geisha, and that they were into wearing geisha clothes, as I was really into Japanese people". Faith No More also mentioned the group and their performances. Their keyboard player Roddy Bottum said: [...] "I saw Sparks play on American Banstand in 1975. My sister and I went out and immediately bought Indiscreet. In 2004, Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos published an article in the NME titled, [...] "why I love the Sparks". He said about their music: [...] "It's only after a few listens you really can get into it [...] Then your really fall in love and bands change your life. Now I can't imagine life without them"." [...] Sparks were also namechecked by the likes of Def Leppard, Ween, Will Sheff of Okkervil River, Mark Burgess of the Chameleons, Cait Brennan, and Justice.|$|E
2500|$|According to author Ed Morales in The Latin Beat: The Rhythms And Roots Of Latin Music From Bossa Nova To Salsa And Beyond (2003), Lopez's music {{explores the}} [...] "romantic innocence" [...] of Latin music, while {{strongly}} identifying with hip hop. Growing up, she {{was influenced by}} Latin styles ranging from salsa to bachata, {{but it was the}} 1979 hip hop song [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] by The Sugarhill Gang that she said <b>changed</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> Her debut album On the 6 fuses the influence of Latin music with R and hip hop, which Lopez described as Latin soul. To the contrary, Morales described it as [...] "state-of-the-art dance pop". Dee Lockett, writing for the Chicago Tribune, stated that songs such as [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] made Lopez [...] "arguably the leading artist in the dance-pop movement at the time". While primarily sung in English, she speaks in Spanish and asserts her Latin heritage throughout the album, which is apparent in the song [...] "Let's Get Loud". She has also recorded bilingual songs, including the Latin pop song [...] "Cariño", for her second album J.Lo. A departure from her previous albums, This Is Me... Then blends 1970s soul with [...] "streetwise" [...] hip hop. [...] "Get Right", from Rebirth, is built around a sample of [...] "Soul Power 74" [...] by Maceo and the Macks, and is characterized by a repetitive saxophone riff. The New York Times called it [...] "one of the year's most unusual R songs" [...] which sounded [...] "like nothing else on the radio".|$|E
