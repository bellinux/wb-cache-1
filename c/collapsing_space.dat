40|$|This paper {{extends the}} recent {{investigation}} of the string theory landscape [1], where {{it was found that}} the decay rate of dS vacua to a <b>collapsing</b> <b>space</b> with a negative vacuum energy can be quite large. The parts of space that experience a decay to a <b>collapsing</b> <b>space,</b> or to a Minkowski vacuum, never return back to dS space. The channels of irreversible vacuum decay serve as sinks for the probability flow. The existence of such sinks is a distinguishing feature of the string theory landscape. We describe relations between several different probability measures for eternal inflation taking into account the existence of the sinks. The local (comoving) description of the inflationary multiverse suffers from the so-called “Boltzmann brain ” problem unless the probability of the decay to the sinks is sufficiently large. We show that some versions of the global (volume-weighted) description do not have this problem even if one ignores the existence of the sinks. Finally, we describe a simplified approach to the calculations of anthropic probabilities in the landscape, which is less powerful but also less ambiguous than other methods...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of static Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) domain walls in stringy {{landscape}} and present a large family of BPS walls interpolating between different supersymmetric vacua. Examples include Kachru, Kallosh, Linde, Trivedi models, STU models, type IIB multiple flux vacua, and models with several Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua. After the uplifting, some of the vacua become de Sitter (dS), whereas some others remain anti-de Sitter. The near-BPS walls separating these vacua {{may be seen as}} bubble walls in the theory of vacuum decay. As an outcome of our investigation of the BPS walls, we found that the decay rate of dS vacua to a <b>collapsing</b> <b>space</b> with a negative vacuum energy can be quite large. The parts of space that experience a decay to a <b>collapsing</b> <b>space,</b> or to a Minkowski vacuum, never return back to dS space.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} queueing systems that consist of server pools in parallel and multiple customer classes. Customer service times {{are assumed to be}} exponentially distributed. We study the asymptotic behavior of these queueing systems in a heavy traffic regime that is known as the Halfin and Whitt many-server asymptotic regime. Our main contribution is a general framework for establishing state <b>space</b> <b>collapse</b> results in this regime for parallel server systems. In our work, state <b>space</b> <b>collapse</b> refers to a decrease in the dimension of the processes tracking the number of customers in each class waiting for service and the number of customers in each class being served by various server pools. We define and introduce a “state <b>space</b> <b>collapse</b> ” function, which governs the exact details of the state <b>space</b> <b>collapse.</b> We show that a state <b>space</b> <b>collapse</b> result holds in many-server heavy traffic if a corresponding deterministic hydrodynamic model satisfies a similar state <b>space</b> <b>collapse</b> condition. Our methodology is similar in spirit to that in Bramson [10], which focuses on the conventional heavy traffic regime. We illustrate the applications of our results by establishing state <b>space</b> <b>collapse</b> results in many-server diffusion limits of static-buffer-priority V-parallel server systems, N-model parallel server systems, and minimum-expected-delay–faster-server-first distributed server pools systems. We show for these systems that the condition on the hydrodynamic model can easily be checked using the standard tools for fluid models...|$|R

Our findings show the importance of the local level, the continuous interplay between the online and the offline and the simultaneous use of a variety of online platforms.

We study the asymptotic behavior of these queueing systems in a heavy traffic regime that is known as the Halfin and Whitt many-server asymptotic regime. Our main contribution is a general framework for establishing state <b>space</b> <b>collapse</b> results in the Halfin and Whitt many-server asymptotic regime for parallel server systems having multiple customer classes. In our work, state <b>space</b> <b>collapse</b> refers to a decrease in the dimension of the processes tracking the number of customers in each class waiting for service and the number of customers in each class being served by various server pools. We define and introduce a state <b>space</b> <b>collapse</b> function, which governs the exact details of the state <b>space</b> <b>collapse.</b> Our methodology is similar in spirit to that in Bramson (1998); however, Bramson studies an asymptotic regime in which the number of servers is fixed and Bramson does not require a state <b>space</b> <b>collapse</b> function. We illustrate the applications of our results in three different parallel server systems. The first system is a distributed parallel server system under the minimum-expected-delay faster-server-first (MED-FSF) or minimumexpected- delay load-balancing (MED-LB) policies. We prove that the MED-FSF policy minimizes the stationary distribution of total number of customers in the system. However, under the MED-FSF policy all the servers in our distributed system except those with the lowest service rate experience 100 % utilization but under the MED-LB policy, on the other hand, the utilizations of all the server pools are equal. The second system we consider is known as the N-model. We show that when the service times only depend on the server pool providing service a static priority rule is asymptotically optimal. Finally, we study two results conjectured in the literature for V-systems. We show for all of these systems that the conditions on the hydrodynamic limits can easily be checked using the standard tools that have been developed in the literature to analyze fluid models. Ph.

40|$|Abstract. This is a {{technical}} paper {{devoted to the}} investigation of <b>collapsing</b> of Alexandrov <b>spaces</b> with lower curvature bound. In a previous paper, the author defined a canonical stratification of an Alexandrov space by the so-called extremal subsets. It is likely that if the limit of a collapsing sequence has no proper extremal subsets, then the <b>collapsing</b> <b>spaces</b> are fiber bundles over the limit space. In this paper a weaker statement is proved, namely, that the homotopy groups of those spaces are related by the Serre exact sequence. A restriction on the ideal boundary of open Riemannian manifolds of nonnegative sectional curvature is obtained as a corollary. We assume familiarity with the basic notions and results about Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded below [Burago et al. 1992; Perelman 1994; Perelman and Petrunin 1994], and with earlier results on collapsing with lower curvature bound [Yamaguchi 1991]. For motivation for the collapsing problem, see [Cheeger et al. 1992] and references therein. 1. Background Notation.

Heidi Saarinen, who was the overall creative director, was based in Cardiff (where she was the performer) while Ian Willcock (the developer of the LIMPT system) coordinated from Singapore.

40|$|Nowadays {{language}} communication {{plays an}} important role in the world. For the technological explosion in the 20 th century, the electronic mass media <b>collapsed</b> <b>space</b> and time barriers in human communication, enabling people to interact and live on a global scale. In this sense, the earth has been turned into a village by the electronic mass media. It not only changes the distance between countries, societies, but also shortens it between people. It means that the technological advancement makes the earth become a village. Since the distance between people is shortened, language communication becomes more important than before. To enhance language abilities, people can apply many different types of language learning strategies according to the learning styles that they have in order to learn the target language. In the Foreign Language Department of University of El Salvador Seminar students year 2006 apply different language learning strategies which make some of them get a grade either above eight or below it. To understand learning strategies, people can go back to basic term, strategy. This word comes from the ancient Greek term strategia meaning generalship or the art of war. A different, but related, word is tactics, which are tools to achieve the success of strategies.
