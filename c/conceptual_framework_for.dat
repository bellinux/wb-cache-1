25|$|Thus, {{emergence}} of nanotechnology {{as a field}} in the 1980s occurred through convergence of Drexler's theoretical and public work, which developed and popularized a <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> nanotechnology, and high-visibility experimental advances that drew additional wide-scale attention to the prospects of atomic control of matter. In the 1980s, two major breakthroughs sparked the growth of nanotechnology in modern era.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} liberal denominations, this notion offered a <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> {{reconciling}} {{the acceptance of}} critical research with {{the maintenance of a}} belief in some form of divine communication, thus preventing a rupture among those who could no longer accept a literal understanding of revelation. No less importantly, it provided the clergy with a rationale for adapting, changing and excising traditional mores and bypassing the accepted conventions of Jewish Law, rooted in the orthodox concept of the explicit transmission of both scripture and its oral interpretation. While also subject to change and new understanding, the basic premise of progressive revelation endures in Reform thought.|$|E
25|$|Culture in the Polish People's Republic, {{to varying}} degrees linked to the intelligentsia's {{opposition}} to the authoritarian system, developed to a sophisticated level under Gomułka and his successors. The creative process was often compromised by state censorship, but significant works were created in fields such as literature, theater, cinema and music, among others. Journalism of veiled understanding and varieties of native and western popular culture were well represented. Uncensored information and works generated by émigré circles were conveyed {{through a variety of}} channels. The Paris-based Kultura magazine developed a <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> dealing with the issues of borders and the neighbors of a future free Poland, but Radio Free Europe was of foremost importance.|$|E

500|$|His most {{important}} publication was Variation and Evolution in Plants, which combined genetics and Darwin's theory {{of natural selection}} to describe plant speciation. It is {{regarded as one of}} the main publications which formed the core of the modern synthesis and still provides the <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> research in plant evolutionary biology; according to Ernst Mayr, [...] "Few later works dealing with the evolutionary systematics of plants have not been very deeply affected by Stebbins' work." [...] He also researched and wrote widely on the role of hybridization and polyploidy in speciation and plant evolution; his work in this area has had a lasting influence on research in the field.|$|E
500|$|Burnet {{spoke and}} wrote widely {{on the topic}} of human biology after his retirement, aiming to reach all strata of society. He courted the media as well as the {{scientific}} community, often leading to sensationalist or scientifically unrigorous report of his outspoken views. This often angered colleagues, who viewed him as abusing his stature to deliberately cause a stir. [...] In 1966 Burnet presented the Boyer Lectures, focusing on human biology. He provided a <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> sustainable development; 21 years later the definition provided by the Brundtland Commission was almost identical. In 1970 he revised an earlier book which was published as Dominant Mammal: the Biology of Human Destiny; it was followed by Endurance of Life, which was published in 1978. The books discuss aspects of human biology, a topic which Burnet wrote on extensively in his later years. In Dominant Mammal he argued that the roots of all human behaviour {{can be found in the}} behaviour of animals; in Endurance he addressed issues of ageing, life, death and the future of mankind. The books strongly polarised the scientific community, and one reviewer described his ideas of sociobiology as [...] "extreme" [...] and giving [...] "a dismal, unappealing view of humanity". In Endurance of Life, he also called for society to accept euthanasia of ill older people, repeat violent criminals, and most controversially, abortion of pregnancies likely to result in disabled children, and infanticide of handicapped newborns. Knowing that there would be a strong backlash for such policies, he departed overseas for a two-month lecture series at the time of the book launch. In his absence, he was strongly assailed in newspaper letters and some correspondents compared his stance on infanticide to that of Adolf Hitler. At the same time, he also changed his stance on nuclear power and advocated its use, and the reinvestment of revenue for research into solar power. This about face angered the environmental movement.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1600s, John Locke {{advanced}} {{the hypothesis that}} people learn primarily from external forces. [...] He believed that the mind was like a blank tablet (tabula rasa), and that successions of simple impressions give rise to complex ideas through association and reflection. [...] Locke is credited with establishing [...] "empiricism" [...] as a criterion for testing the validity of knowledge, thus providing a <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> later development of excremental methodology in the natural and social sciences.|$|E
2500|$|In the sutras, Buddhist {{religious}} texts, {{the four}} truths have both a symbolic and a propositional function.

40|$|This {{presentation}} provides <b>conceptual</b> <b>frameworks</b> <b>for</b> understanding {{critics of}} educational technology; these frameworks are developed {{by using a}} series of concepts, approaches, and techniques of historical analysis from the area of intellectual history. The difference between study {{in the history of}} ideas and the history of culture is noted. The following problems with the way that the history of ideas is conducted as a research method are identified: the "whole " of the concept is neglected; an elitist perspective; insufficient concern with content; and lack of objectivity. Factors in the history of ideas and four types of definitions are examined. The presentation format revolves around the following <b>conceptual</b> <b>frameworks</b> <b>for</b> analyzing the criticisms of educational technology: (1) concerns about the development of man-machine systems, (2) concerns about technological momentum; (3) concerns about individualizing instruction; (4) concerns about gender bias; and, (5) concerns about dehumanization.

2500|$|Building ecology is a <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> {{understanding}} {{architecture and}} {{the built environment}} as the interface between the dynamically interdependent elements of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment. Rather than viewing buildings as inanimate or static objects, building ecologist Hal Levin views them as interfaces or intersecting domains of living and non-living systems. The microbial ecology of the indoor environment {{is strongly dependent on}} the building materials, occupants, contents, environmental context and the indoor and outdoor climate. [...] The strong relationship between atmospheric chemistry and indoor air quality and the chemical reactions occurring indoors. The chemicals may be nutrients, neutral or biocides for the microbial organisms. The microbes produce chemicals that affect the building materials and occupant health and well being. Humans manipulate the ventilation, temperature and humidity to achieve comfort with the concomitant effects on the microbes that populate and evolve.|$|E
2500|$|The term sacca (Sanskrit: satya) is {{a central}} term in Indian thought and religion.

According to Rupert Gethin, the four truths are [...] "four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening." [...] They function as [...] "a convenient <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> making sense of Buddhist thought." [...] According to K.R. Norman, probably the best translation is [...] "the truth of the noble one (the Buddha)." [...] It is a statement of how things are seen by a Buddha, how things really are when seen correctly. It is the truthful way of seeing, Through not seeing things this way, and behaving accordingly, we suffer.|$|E
2500|$|According to the World Health Organization, social {{determinants}} of health include early child development, globalization, health systems, measurement and evidence, urbanization, employment conditions, social exclusion, public health conditions, {{and women and}} gender equality. [...] More generally, the WHO considers the circumstances of daily life and structural drivers, which determine health outcome differentials, as the {{social determinants}} of health. Different exposures and vulnerabilities to disease and injury determined by social, occupational, and physical environments and conditions, result in more or less vulnerability to poor health. Structural drivers, on the other hand, include stratification in society, biases and societal norms, economic and social policy, and governance. [...] These themes are condensed into a distinct structure of defining the social determinants of health in poverty. The World Health Organization's Social Determinants Council recognized two distinct forms of social determinants for health- social position and socioeconomic and political context. The following divisions are adapted from World Health Organization's Social Determinants <b>Conceptual</b> <b>Framework</b> <b>for</b> explaining and understanding social determinants of health.|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{nanotechnology}} traces {{the development of}} the concepts and experimental work falling under the broad category of nanotechnology. [...] Although nanotechnology is a relatively recent development in scientific research, the development of its central concepts happened {{over a longer period of}} time. [...] The emergence of nanotechnology in the 1980s was caused by the convergence of experimental advances such as the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 and the discovery of fullerenes in 1985, with the elucidation and popularization of a <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> the goals of nanotechnology beginning with the 1986 publication of the book Engines of Creation. [...] The field was subject to growing public awareness and controversy in the early 2000s, with prominent debates about both its potential implications as well as the feasibility of the applications envisioned by advocates of molecular nanotechnology, and with governments moving to promote and fund research into nanotechnology. [...] The early 2000s also saw the beginnings of commercial applications of nanotechnology, although these were limited to bulk applications of nanomaterials rather than the transformative applications envisioned by the field[...]|$|E
2500|$|In his 1989 posthumous book, The Global Village, McLuhan, {{collaborating with}} Bruce R. Powers, {{provided}} a strong <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> understanding the cultural {{implications of the}} technological advances associated {{with the rise of}} a worldwide electronic network. This is a major work of McLuhan's because it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of Acoustic Space, and it provides a critique of standard 20th century communication models like the Shannon–Weaver model. McLuhan distinguishes between the existing worldview of Visual Space – a linear, quantitative, classically geometric model – and that of Acoustic Space – a holistic, qualitative order with a complex intricate paradoxical topology. [...] "Acoustic Space has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or center is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere." [...] The transition from Visual to Acoustic Space was not automatic {{with the advent of the}} global network, but would have to be a conscious project. The [...] "universal environment of simultaneous electronic flow" [...] inherently favors right-brain Acoustic Space, yet we are held back by habits of adhering to a fixed point of view. There are no boundaries to sound. We hear from all directions at once. Yet Acoustic and Visual Space are in fact inseparable. The resonant interval is the invisible borderline between Visual and Acoustic Space. This is like the television camera that the Apollo 8 astronauts focused on the Earth after they had orbited the moon.|$|E
2500|$|Sylvia Cremer (then at the University of Regensburg) {{gave the}} first {{definition}} of social immunity in her seminal 2007 Current Biology paper 'Social Immunity', {{saying that the}} [...] "collective action or altruistic behaviours of infected individuals that benefit the colony" [...] before laying out a <b>conceptual</b> <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> thinking about the topic using examples from primates and eusocial insects. Cremer's definition focused on the collective benefits of behaviours and was adopted by other behavioural ecologists (e.g. Wilson-Rich 2009) when describing immune phenomena which were contingent on the action of multiple individuals. Cremer went on to develop a series of comparisons between personal and social immune systems—she explained that her definition of social immunity encompassed [...] "the nature of these defences that they cannot be performed efficiently by single individuals, but depend strictly on the cooperation {{of at least two}} individuals". However, in 2010, Sheena Cotter and Rebecca Kilner (both then at the University of Cambridge) proposed to widen the definition of social immunity to [...] "any type of immune response that has been selected to increase the fitness of the challenged individual and one or more recipients", and recommended that the phenomena described by Cremer be known as collective immunity. This definition places importance on the evolutionary origin of behaviours rather than on their functional role at present; Cotter and Kilner explained that their broader definition would include immune behaviours in both animal families and social microbes as well as situations where herd immunity exists due to investment in personal immunity, arguing that this allowed for investigations of the evolution of social immunity to have a [...] "greater depth than would otherwise be possible". They further suggested that the evolution of social immunity be seen as one of the major transitions in evolution. Joël Meunier (University of Mainz) proposed a further redefinition in his 2015 paper on the role of social immunity in the evolution of group living, suggesting that Cotter and Kilner's definition could problematically encompass immune defences which arise not due to social life but due to shared location; Meunier defines a social immune system as [...] "any collective and personal mechanism that has emerged and/or is maintained at least partly due to the anti-parasite defence it provides to other group members".|$|E
