40|$|The general {{error model}} of high {{precision}} <b>surface</b> <b>grinder</b> is presented by using rigid body kinematics theory and coordinate transformation. To meet the machining requirement of large axisymmetry aspheric lens, the grating parallel grinding method is adopted. Considering high precision <b>surface</b> <b>grinder</b> {{structure and the}} main error factors affect the machining accuracy of large aspheric, a large axisymmetric aspheric error model is proposed, {{which can be used}} to predict surface accuracy and compensation grinding. The main error factors are discussed and it is shown that the straightness error, positioning error and arc radii error are main errors that effect surface error distribution, meanwhile, surface error value is the mixed result of each individual error. The experiments are carried out and in agreement with the theoretical results. The grinding experiment shows that the model can well predict surface accuracy and surface accuracy is improved after compensation grinding. ? 2013 Journal of Mechanical Engineering...|$|R

Many different instruments have been de-veloped for the measurement of friction and wear. 1 - 5 Often the instrument was de-signed to accommodate some particular type of material, environment, or test con-dition. Studies reported in the dental literature have been limited to wear mea-surements with simulated toothbrushing methods, 6 - 9 or on prosthetic teeth mounted on an articulator. 10 This study will describe the experimental instrumentation for tests under a variety of variables, as well as simulated mouth con-ditions.

40|$|ELID-grinding of cermets {{has been}} carried out on a {{retrofitted}} Jung <b>surface</b> <b>grinder</b> with different cast iron-bonded (CIB) diamond wheels. In case of rough grinding, with a wheel of 46 µm abrasives, ELID-grinding is preferable compared to grinding with a conventional resin-bonded wheel or a CIB wheel without ELID. Resin-bonded wheels are characterized by low G-ratios and are prone to chattering effects. Metal-bonded wheels are very durable, and especially for avoiding glazing effects during longer grinding cycles, ELID-grinding is the best choice. The maximal MRR in ‘ELID-roughing’ on the used <b>surface</b> <b>grinder</b> is measured to be 1 mm³/s, leading to a roughness of about 0. 4 µm Ra. The ‘ELID-finishing’ steps are implemented on the same grinding machine, so the workpiece {{does not need to be}} dismounted. Several sets of experiments based on the Design of Experiments method show that lower axial feeds and higher duty ratios of the power supply improve the surface quality effectively. With the wheel of 10 µm grit size, chattering can be avoided by limiting the theoretical MRR to 0. 05 mm³/s. To obtain a final Sa roughness below 10 nm, the last finishing wheel should remove less than 0. 3 10 - 3 mm³/s. The total processing time of the finishing steps is less than 30 minutes for a workpiece area of 375 mm³. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Grinding {{machines}} remove {{material from}} the work piece by abrasion, which can generate substantial amounts of heat. To cool the work piece {{so that it does}} not overheat and go outside its tolerance, grinding machines incorporate a coolant. The coolant also benefits the machinist as the heat generated may cause burns. In high-precision grinding machines (most cylindrical and <b>surface</b> <b>grinders),</b> the final grinding stages are usually set up so that they remove about 200 nm (less than 1/10000 in) per pass - this generates so little heat that even with no coolant, the temperature rise is negligible.|$|R
