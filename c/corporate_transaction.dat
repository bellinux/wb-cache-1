In {{order to}} {{accurately}} and effectively evaluate the trust level between enterprises whose supply chain exists in direct transactions, this paper proposed a trust level evaluation method based on reputation, this method by introducing corporate transactions satisfaction level, <b>corporate</b> <b>transaction</b> amount, corporate transactions time, corporate transactions number and rewards and punishments factor five factors, which make description and measurement of corporate reputation more accurate. Meanwhile, {{in order to}} improve the measurement accuracy of corporate transactions satisfaction level, this paper proposes a transaction satisfaction evaluation method based on fuzzy evaluation, the transaction satisfaction were evaluated from product quality, product cost and completion time three aspects. Simulation results show that the model proposed by this paper can effectively evaluate the direct trust level of supply chain enterprises by the reputation. Compared with similar existing trust model, this model evaluates direct trust between enterprises more accurately and objectively. It also effectively reduces the occurrence of corporate fraud and speculative behavior...|$|E

One form of opinion confirms that execution and delivery by {{the company of the}} agreement in question and performance by the company of its obligations under the agreement will not conflict with or result in a breach of or default under the company 2 ̆ 7 s charter, by-laws or specified contracts.

40|$|The {{merger of}} {{organizations}} historically has occurred {{primarily in the}} business sector. However, in recent {{years there has been}} a proliferation of merger activity in the nonprofit community. As a restructuring strategy, the merger has become an increasingly important vehicle for nonprofit organizations in dealing with changing environmental conditions. This chapter explores six theoretical perspectives to explain why organizations come together, or merge. These perspectives suggest conditions that lead organizations to consider merger and, as such, provide leaders in nonprofit organizations with tools for assessing the appropriateness of merger as a strategv for restructuring. DEFINITION OF MERGER Merger is a form of restructuring wherebv one or more organizations is completely absorbed by another organization whose corporate existence is preserved. The body being absorbed dissolves and loses its corporate existence (Yankev & Singer, 1991). The American Hospital Association (989) defined merger as a statutorily defined <b>corporate</b> <b>transaction,</b> in which two similar corporations come together permanently, leaving a single survivor corporation. Assets {{do not have to be}} transferred, because this happens by operation of law, and the surviving corporation owns all the assets and liabilities of both parties...|$|E

Only, according to Epstein, if she was challenging the combination of bigotry and the coercive power of the state. If she was challenging private custom standing alone, she was in error because market forces would make private discrimination unimportant. Epstein 2 ̆ 7 s distinction is illusory. The state was implicated in the bus operation. Legislation that granted limited liability and permitted concentration of capital cut off the personal responsibility the common law recognized.

The corporate transactions described here involve a transfer of the share in a Czech capital corporation (i. e. limited liability company and joint stock company), transfer of the company's enterprise, distribution of the profit to the shareholders and distribution of other equity funds to the shareholders. All transactions are described in connection with both their legal conditions and tax impacts. This thesis does not cover the impacts {{of all types of}} taxation in the Czech Republic, but focuses on selected taxes, mainly income tax (both corporate and personal), value added tax, and real estate transfer tax, as the most important types of taxes playing a relevant role in connection with the transactions mentioned above.

40|$|ENGLISH ABSTRACT: On 27 September 2010, {{the much}} {{anticipated}} entry of Walmart to the South African retail sector was announced. Walmart Stores Incorporated publicised {{that they would}} make a non-binding offer of R 148 per share for the entire number of Massmart Holding’s outstanding shares. The offer presented a premium of 19. 2 percent and valued Massmart at R 31 billion rand. Walmart later altered the offer to purchase 51 percent of the outstanding shares at the same offer price which Massmart consequently accepted. This concluded the largest investment by an American company, the tenth largest <b>corporate</b> <b>transaction</b> in South Africa and the fifth largest acquisition by Walmart. From a Massmart shareholders’ perspective, was it the correct decision to accept Walmart’s offer? Academic literature suggests that most mergers and acquisitions fail {{to live up to}} their expectations and ultimately fail to create shareholder value. Some of the most common reasons listed are the failure to determine the fair market value of an acquisition and engaging in mergers and acquisitions for the wrong reasons. Another common pitfall is that valuation methods in general do not link the company’s strategy to the valuation process, to assess the potential impact of the merger or acquisition on company performance. This case study based research report analyses the Walmart-Massmart acquisition to review Walmart’s offer price. The analysis links both companies’ business model and strategy to the valuation process, to determine the outcome on shareholder value within Massmart following the acquisition...|$|E
