The universal principle of the special theory of relativity is contained in the postulate: The laws of physics are invariant with respect to Lorentz transformations (for the transition from one inertial system to any other arbitrarily chosen inertial system).

40|$|One of the {{important}} logistic tasks is transfer of finished products from producers to customers. If {{there is a need}} to supply a large–scale area with large number of customers, it is disadvantageous to deliver products from the only central warehouse or direct from producers. It is suitable to build up local distribution warehouses. The promptitude and quality of customer services improve as the number of warehouses increases. Transport cost created by transfer of products from producers to customers is reduced too. On the other hand, both the fixed costs caused by the warehouse operation and cost of maintenance of greater current, buffer and protective stocks increase all at once. The contribution is concerned with a common case of a location-allocation problem, which involves both the location of distribution centres or warehouses and an allocation of customers to warehouses. Warehouses receive products from production plants and distribute them to customers such as retail or wholesale outlets. The well-known Weiszfeld algorithm [1] was adapted for sequentially increasing number of warehouses until adding another warehouse is advantageous from transport cost standpoint. The basic criterion for decision is minimization of freight cost, but increasing expenses of product stocks are considered as well. Distances between warehouses and customers are given by a suitable two-dimensional metric corresponding to the network of routes. Location of customers is given by means of either geographical information systems or GPS system. Key words.

Software such as Landmark, Drilling Office X, etc. These softwares handle everything from the well placement to analysis of hydraulics, torque, and so forth for every drilled section of the well. The problem, however, {{is that they are}} closed systems with no insight to the procedure of the computation. And they are expensive, very expensive. This Thesis aims to build the foundation required for the position part of a drilling software. This is accomplished by explaining in detail the field of geodesy and map projections and the associated formulae, with special considerations for the area offshore Norway. Once the guidelines for transformation and conversion have been established, the formulae are implemented in MATLAB. All implemented functions are then verified, for every conceivable method of operation. After which both the limitation and accuracy of the various functions are discussed. More specifically, the iterative step required for the computation of geographic coordinates, the difference between the North Sea Formulae and the Bursa-Wolf transformation, and the accuracy of Thomas-UTM series for UTM projections. The conclusion is that the recommended guidelines have been established and implemented. The implementation was verified, and the proper handling of information is suggested. It also concludes that all functions are more than accurate enough for drilling purposes, {{and that there is a}} clear difference between using the Bursa-Wolf transformation and the North Sea Formulae. The difference is discussed in detail, and a intersecting area near the 62 ^∘N is found with 4 meters or less deviation. There are multiple areas on which to continue the work carried out on this Thesis. Within the field of Geodesy, it is suggested that work is done to map the transformations used worldwide, and implement these with the appropriate selection criteria for automation. Attempting to find a joint transformation for the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea would also be recommended. This transformation should replace both the North Sea Formulae and the Bursa-Wolf transformation.

40|$|The <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> dinitrogen to ammonia is a {{fundamental}} process for sustaining life on our planet. Ammonia provides a source of fixed nitrogen for nitrification and assimilation into plants, and is the ultimate source of almost all nitrogenated compounds. Synthetic ammonia is produced on a colossal scale by the Haber Bosch process, with an annual ammonia output exceeding 130 million tonnes. However, the intensive operating conditions of this process require a staggering energy cost; hence, {{the development of a}} lower energy solution is recognised as one of the major challenges of modern chemistry. This dissertation explores the chemistry of homogeneous systems based on iron diphosphine complexes that are able to transform coordinated dinitrogen into ammonia. A greater understanding of these systems may provide insight into the iron-based catalysts utilised in both biological nitrogen fixation and the industrial Haber Bosch process. Ultimately, this could lead to a more sustainable process for meeting the global requirement for fixed nitrogen. Chapter 1 provides a general introduction into dinitrogen fixation chemistry, with a particular focus on homogeneous systems involving iron. Chapter 2 describes a convenient synthetic protocol to 1, 2 -bis(dialkylphosphino) ethanes. These are among the most versatile ligands used in inorganic chemistry, although issues with prior syntheses, often involving extremely hazardous phosphine precursors, has limited their accessibility.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{digital signal}} {{processing}} landscape has long been dominated by the microprocessors with enhancements such as single cycle multiply-accumulate instructions and special addressing modes. While these processors are low cost and offer extreme flexibility, they are often not fast enough for truly demanding DSP tasks. The advent of reconfigurable logic computers permits the higher speeds of dedicated hardware solutions at costs that are competitive with the traditional software approach. Unfortunately algorithms optimized for these microprocessors based systems do not map well into hardware. While hardware efficient solutions often exist, {{the dominance of the}} software systems has kept these solutions out of the spotlight. Among these hardware- efficient algorithms is a class of iterative solutions for trigonometric and other transcendental functions that use only shifts and adds to perform. The trigonometric functions are based on vector rotations, while other functions such as square root are implemented using an incremental expression of the desired function. The trigonometric algorithm is called CORDIC an acronym for Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer. The incremental functions are performed with a very simple extension to the hardware architecture and while not CORDIC in the strict sense, are often included because of the close similarity. The CORDIC algorithms generally produce one additional bit of accuracy for each iteration. DESCRIPTION: A detailed study on various modes of CORDIC algorithm is done. First of all a study is made how the CORDIC algorithm is derived from the general vector equation. Then a study is done regarding the various modes of the CORDIC algorithm and how {{it can be used to}} find the sine, cosine, tan and logarithm functions, its use in <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>coordinate</b> systems. An attempt is made to carry out a rigorous study of its use in DSP oriented applications AND how it has revolutionized the DSP scenario. Finally simulations are carried out using MATLAB to support the purpose of our study. RESULTS The results clearly bring out the advantage of using CORDIC algorithm. First of all the sine and cosine of any angle could be found out easily. Similar is the case of logarithm and hyperbolic functions. The simulation results prove the fact that the hardware complexity gets reduced by using the CORDIC algorithm. A large no of plots were obtained for different 7 functions. Finally the implementation in DCT was carried out and the results obtained were in line with those of the theoretical values. CONCLUSION The CORDIC algorithms presented in this paper are well known in the research and super computing circles. Here the basic CORDIC algorithm and a partial list of potential applications of potential applications of a CORDIC based processor array to {{digital signal processing}} is presented. The CORDIC based DCT architecture for low power design has been proposed. The proposed multiplierless CORDIC based DCT architecture produces high throughput and is easy to implementing VLSI. The proposed architecture reduced the input data range for the CORDIC processor by split and the no of compensation iterations in CORDIC based DCT computation by utilizing that most images have similar neighboring pixels.
