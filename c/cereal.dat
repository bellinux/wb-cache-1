She was able {{to prove that the}} lodging or flattening of wheat close to harvest was frequently not the result of wind or rain, but instead caused by take-all and eyespot, both soil-borne fungal diseases. Glynne was able to not only identify the fungal cause and which strains of <b>cereal</b> were less susceptible, but also establish that crop rotation exacerbated the issue. On this basis, she was able to advise which strains of <b>cereal</b> should be planted in the affected fields.

We examined whether the {{nutritional quality}} of Australian breakfast <b>cereals</b> has improved between 2004 and 2010, and whether any change could be detected after the introduction of Daily Intake Guide (DIG) front-of-pack labelling.

The degree of weed infestation in the fields in the protective zone of RPN depended on environment conditions.

In the lightest podsolic soils, made of loose sand and slightly loamy sand. winter and spring <b>cereals</b> were additionally infested by Equisetum arvense and two acidophylic species: Seleranthus annuus and Spergula arvensis. The crops in brown loess soil were infested by Matricaria maritima subsp. inodora. The most difficult weed species in brown soil formed from gaizes and limestone soil were: Convolvulus arvensis, Papaver rhoeas and Galium aparine. Moreover winter cercals in limestone soil showed high or medium infestation with Consolida regalis, Aethusa cynapium, Lathyrus tuberosus and low infestation with Apera spica-venti and Centaurea cyanus. Spring <b>cereals</b> were less infested than winter <b>cereals.</b> Apera spica-venti and Centaurea cyanus were less common with spring <b>cereals</b> than with winter <b>cereals.</b> Also, spring <b>cereals</b> showed high or medium infestation with Convolvulus arvensis.

40|$|When using household-level data {{to examine}} {{consumer}} demand {{it is common}} to find that consumers purchase only a subset of the available goods, setting the demand for the remaining goods to zero. Ignoring such censoring of the dependent variables can lead to estimators with poor statistical properties and estimates that lead to poor policy decisions. In this paper we investigate household demand for four types of breakfast <b>cereals,</b> such as whole grain ready-to-eat, non-whole grain ready-to-eat, whole grain hot and non-whole grain hot <b>cereals,</b> using a censored Al- most Ideal Demand System (AIDS) and estimate the parameters of the model via Bayesian methods. Using household level scanner data (ACNielsen Homescan) we find that demand for all types of breakfast <b>cereals</b> is inelastic to changes in prices. The expenditure elasticity is slightly above unity for the whole grain ready-to-eat <b>cereals</b> suggesting that as the expenditure on <b>cereals</b> increases households will allocate proportionally more on whole-grain ready-to-eat <b>cereals</b> and less on other <b>cereals.</b> AIDS model, Bayesian econometrics, censored, <b>cereals,</b> whole grains, Agricultural and Food Policy, Consumer/Household Economics, Demand and Price Analysis, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Food Security and Poverty, Health Economics and Policy, C 11, C 34, D 12,...|$|R
