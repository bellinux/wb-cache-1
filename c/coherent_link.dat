Then, the chapter discusses optimization of modulation formats in coded systems. It distinguishes between three cases, {{depending on the type}} of decoder employed, which pose quite different requirements on the choice of modulation format. The three cases are soft-decision decoding, hard-decision decoding, and iterative decoding, which loosely correspond to weak, medium, and strong coding, respectively. The chapter also discusses the realizations of the transmitter and transmission link properties and the receiver algorithms, including DSP and decoding. It further explains how to simply determine the transmitted symbol from the received 4 D vector, without resorting to a full search of the Euclidean distances to all points in the whole constellation...|$|R

In this demonstration, the transmitted data is binary phase modulated at 100 Mbps using an external resonant cavity phase modulator. At the receiving end, the signal is detected using a balanced heterodyne detector. An auxiliary frequency tracking loop (FTL) is used to help the initial frequency acquisition before handing over to the carrier phase tracking loop. The FTL is implemented using a delay line discriminator, and the detected frequency error is fed back to the local oscillator laser to close the tracking loop. Phase coherent reception is achieved by synchronizing the carrier phase using a Costas tracking loop.

40|$|Extreme {{variations}} of Earth’s magnetic field {{occurred in the}} Levant region around 1000 BC, when the field intensity rapidly rose and fell {{by a factor of}} 2.

Here we show that the Levantine spike must span > 60 ° longitude at Earth’s surface if it originates from the core–mantle boundary (CMB). Several low intensity data are incompatible with this geometric bound, though age uncertainties suggest these data could have sampled the field before the spike emerged. Models that best satisfy energetic and geometric constraints produce CMB spikes 8 – 22 ° wide, peaking at O(100) [*]mT. We suggest that the Levantine spike reflects an intense CMB flux patch that grew in place before migrating northwest, contributing to growth of the dipole field.
