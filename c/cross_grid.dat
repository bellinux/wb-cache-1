50|$|The River Lerryn is a {{river in}} east Cornwall, England, UK, a {{tributary}} of the River Fowey. The Lerryn is the largest of the tributaries which enter the estuary of the Fowey. The river is tidal up to the village of Lerryn. The landscape of the Lerryn catchment is rural and includes heathland, moorland and rough pasture in the upper reaches and broadleaf, coniferous and mixed plantation woodland in the lower. This catchment includes four SSSIs, including Redlake Meadows & Hoggs Moor. The Lerryn rises at Fairy <b>Cross</b> (<b>Grid</b> ref.

50|$|Roundabout {{junctions}} {{were built}} at intersections because the grid roads {{were intended to}} carry large volumes of traffic: this type of junction is efficient at dealing with these volumes. Some major roads are dual carriageway, the others are single carriageway. Along one side of each single carriageway grid road there is a (grassed) reservation to permit dualling or additional transport infrastructure at a later date. To date this has been limited. The edges of each grid square are landscaped and densely planted, some additionally have berms. Traffic movements are fast, with relatively little congestion since there are alternative routes to any particular destination other than during the (brief) peak periods. The national speed limit applies on the grid roads, although lower speed limits have been introduced on some stretches to reduce accident rates. Pedestrians rarely need to <b>cross</b> <b>grid</b> roads at grade, as underpasses and bridges exist in frequent places along each stretch {{of all of the}} grid roads. However, the new districts to be added by the expansion plans for Milton Keynes are departing from this model, with less separation and using 'at grade' crossings. This approach, which contradicts the original design ethos, has been a cause for conflict between residents and the Council who are often regarded as failing to preserve the unique development style of the city. Monitoring station data shows that pollution is lower than in other settlements of a similar size.|$|E
40|$|The <b>cross</b> <b>grid</b> encoder is a {{diffraction}} grating type encoder to measure two-dimensional {{position of a}} optical head by using a grid plate, and is widely used in the industry to evaluate the two-dimensional contouring performance of a machine tool. In the graphical display of measured contouring error profiles, the error is often magnified to some given scale {{with respect to the}} reference trajectory. The conventional algorithm to compute the magnified contouring error profile, adopted in a commercial software to analyze an error profile measured by the <b>cross</b> <b>grid</b> encoder, makes the magnified trajectory discontinuous when the given reference trajectory is unsmooth, which makes it difficult to understand the magnified trajectory especially at corners. This paper proposes a new algorithm to compute the magnified trajectory of two-dimensional contouring error profiles such that the magnified trajectory becomes continuous even when the reference trajectory is unsmooth. Application examples are presented with error profiles obtained by using a <b>cross</b> <b>grid</b> encoder applied to a commercial machining center...|$|E

A method shown here avoids many of the robustness and efficiency problems previously associated with Delaunay triangulation. As an added feature, a simple algorithm is shown which allows removal of diagonal edges from cells that are nearly rectangular.

40|$|The {{grid method}} is a full-field optical {{technique}} for computing surface displacements and strains of a material {{by analyzing the}} phase of grid lines patterned on the specimen. To date, most experiments using the grid method have measured only two-dimensional in-plane deformations. Here, the grid method is extended to three dimensions by using a <b>crossed</b> <b>grid</b> pattern and a diffraction grating which enables acquiring images from multiple viewing angles on a single camera. In-plane displacements and strains are computed using the conventional grid method, and the corresponding three-dimensional (3 D) displacements—including out-of-plane displacements or shapes—are computed by analyzing the images collected at different viewing angles. The technique is demonstrated by measuring 3 D rigid body motion, the 3 D displacements of a membrane in a pressure-bulge experiment, and the out-of-plane curvature of a cylindrical specimen...|$|R

This paper is focused on characterization of crack detection methods using strain mode shapes. To characterize crack detection methods, we changed sensing grids from corner grid to <b>cross</b> <b>grid</b> and geometry of the specimens from rectangular to triangular plate. Rest of conditions was fixed. For crack detection criteria, COMAC, ECOMAC, ADSM and new method have been used {{and the results are}} compared with each other.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{applying}} a hyperbolic grid generation scheme {{to the construction}} of meshes in general 2 -D regions has been developed. This approach, which follows the theory developed by Steger and Chaussee (1980) and the algorithm outlined by Kinsey and Barth (1984), is based on improving local grid control. This is accomplished by adding an angle control source term to the equations and using a new algorithm for computing the volume source term. These modifications lead to superior methods for fixing the 'local' problems of hyperbolic grid generation, namely, propagation of initial discontinuities and formation of <b>grid</b> shocks (<b>crossing</b> <b>grid</b> lines). More importantly, a method for solving the global problem of constraining the grid with more than one boundary (internal grid generation) has been developed. These algorithms have been implemented in an interactive grid generation program and the results for several geometries are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a fore-optics module that converts the SHARC-II camera at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory into a sensitive imaging polarimeter at wavelengths of 350 and 450 microns. We refer to this module as "SHARP". SHARP splits the incident radiation into two orthogonally polarized beams that are then re-imaged onto {{opposite ends of the}} 32 x 12 pixel detector array in SHARC-II. A rotating half-wave plate is used just upstream from the polarization-splitting optics. The effect of SHARP is to convert SHARC-II into a dual-beam 12 x 12 pixel polarimeter. A novel feature of SHARP's design is the use of a <b>crossed</b> <b>grid</b> in a submillimeter polarimeter. Here we describe the detailed optical design of SHARP and present results of tests carried out during our first few observing runs. At 350 microns, the beam size (9 arcseconds), throughput (75 %), and instrumental polarization (< 1 %) are all very close to our design goals. Comment: submitted to Applied Optic...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} an X-ray detector using microchannel plates as a photocathode surface and imaging photoelectron multiplier, and a <b>crossed</b> wire <b>grid</b> as a two-dimensional position-sensitive detector. The position resolution is 10 microns. The <b>crossed</b> wire <b>grid</b> consists of 100 -micron-diam wires on 200 -micron centers.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop and test a procedure for modeling the specimen-specific mechanical response of multicellular constructs to globally applied strains/stresses using the Material Point Method (MPM). Volumetric confocal image data of vascularized collagen constructs were used to generate particle distributions. Refinement and sensitivity studies were performed. A variant of the standard MPM algorithm, in which the background grid is not reset between computational cycles, was investigated. Results demonstrated that geometric representations could be generated easily from confocal image data. Despite the globally homogeneous applied strain, stress distribution in the vascular constructs was highly inhomogeneous. The modified MPM algorithm eliminated a common MPM artifact that results from particles <b>crossing</b> <b>grid</b> boundaries. This research demonstrates the feasibility of using meshless methods for specimen-specific analysis of complex multicellular constructs, enabling the study of the relationship between local cellular stresses and strains and cellular catabolic / anabolic responses to mechanical conditioning. 2...|$|R
