6000|$|Even {{during his}} {{previous}} life {{two lines of}} investigation had pointed clearly to two distinct types of contrivance as possible, and both of these had been realised. On the one hand was the great engine-driven aeroplane, a double row of horizontal floats with a big aerial screw behind, {{and on the other}} the nimbler aeropile. The aeroplanes flew safely only in a calm or moderate wind, and sudden storms, occurrences that were now accurately predictable, rendered them for all practical purposes useless. They were built of enormous size--the usual stretch of wing being six hundred feet or more, and the length of the fabric a thousand feet. They were for passenger traffic alone. The lightly swung car they carried was from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet in length. It Was hung in a peculiar manner in order to minimise the <b>complex</b> <b>vibration</b> that even a moderate wind produced, and for the same reason the little seats within the car--each passenger remained seated during the voyage--were slung with great freedom of movement. The starting of the mechanism was only possible from a gigantic car on the rail of a specially constructed stage. Graham had seen these vast stages, the flying stages, from the crow's nest very well. Six huge blank areas they were, with a giant [...] "carrier" [...] stage on each.|$|E

We investigated the qualitative characteristics of dual-frequency vibrations as the simplest <b>complex</b> <b>vibrations</b> compared to single-frequency vibrations. Two psychophysical experiments were conducted to elucidate the perceptual characteristics of these vibrations by measuring the perceptual distances among single-frequency and dual-frequency vibrations. The perceptual distances of dual-frequency vibrations between their two frequency components along their relative intensity ratio were measured in Experiment I. The estimated perceptual spaces for three frequency conditions showed non-linear perceptual differences between the dual-frequency and single-frequency vibrations. A perceptual space was estimated from the measured perceptual distances among ten dual-frequency compositions and five single-frequency vibrations in Experiment II. The effect of the component frequency and the frequency ratio was revealed in the perceptual space. In a percept of dual-frequency vibration, the lower frequency component showed a dominant effect. Additionally, the perceptual difference among single-frequency and dual-frequency vibrations were increased with a low relative difference between two frequencies of a dual-frequency vibration.

In this paper an analytical model of a simply supported rectangular plate is introduced. It allows a quick calculation of <b>complex</b> <b>vibration</b> patterns with different properties, avoiding time consuming and sometimes unstable damped modal analysis in finite-element-software. Using this model it is possible to generate vibration patterns with varying level and spatial distribution of travelling waves as well as different symmetry of amplitude distributions, in order to reveal the important influence factors on sound radiation. Despite the fact that the analytical model generates idealised vibration patterns, the presented consideraton significantly improves phenomenological understanding of acoustic effects in <b>complex</b> <b>vibration</b> modes. The accuracy of the presented model is validated by results of finite element modal analysis and is evaluated in terms of resulting amplitude and phase distributions of the vibrating surface. The results of both suggested approaches are compared using modal radiation efficiencies, spatial distributions of far field acoustic intensity and sound field directivity. Some additional conclusions are made using the analytical model concerning important acoustic metrics of structural vibration patterns.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the use of {{piezoelectric}} sensors and actuators for the active suppression of vibrations associated with the motor-driven rotation of thin flexible plate held vertically. Motor-driven flexible structures are multi-input multi-output systems. The design of active vibration-suppression controllers for these systems is far more challenging than for flexible structures with a fixed end, due to the effects of coupling and nonlinear vibration behavior generated in structures with poor damping. To simplify the design of the controller and achieve satisfactory vibration suppression, we treated the coupling of vibrations caused by the rotary motion of the thin flexible plate as external disturbances and system uncertainties. We employed an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control algorithm in the design of a single-input–single-output controller for the suppression of vibrations using piezoelectric sensors and actuators. We also used a repetitive control system to reduce periodic vibrations associated with the repetitive motions induced by the motor.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce noise emitted by {{vibrating}} structures additional damping treatments such as constraint layer damping or embedded elastomer layers can be used. To save weight and cost, the additional damping is often placed at some critical locations of the structure, what leads to spatially inhomogeneous distribution of damping. This inhomogeneous distribution of structural damping leads to an occurrence of <b>complex</b> <b>vibration</b> modes, which are no longer dominated by pure standing waves, but by a superposition of travelling and standing waves. The existence of <b>complex</b> <b>vibration</b> modes raises the question about their influence on sound radiation. Previous studies on the sound radiation of complex modes of rectangular plates reveal, that, depending on the direction of travelling waves, the radiation efficiency of structural modes can slightly decrease or significantly increase. These observations have been made using a rectangular plate with a simple inhomogeneous damping configuration which includes a single plate boundary with a higher structural damping ratio. In order {{to answer the question}} about the influence of other possible damping configurations on the sound radiation properties, this paper addresses the self- and mutual-radiation efficiencies of the resulting <b>complex</b> <b>vibration</b> modes. Numerical simulations are used for the calculation of complex structural modes of different inhomogeneous damping configurations with varying geometrical form and symmetry. The evaluation of self- and mutual-radiation efficiencies reveals that primarily the symmetry properties of the inhomogeneous damping distribution affect the sound radiation characteristics. Especially the asymmetric distributions of inhomogeneous damping show a high influence on the investigated acoustic metrics. The presented study also reveals that the acoustic cross-coupling between structural modes, which is described by the mutual-radiation efficiencies, generally increases with the presence of travelling waves...|$|E

It is increasingly recognised that the neural transduction and processing of these vibrations {{plays an important role}} in the dynamic tactile perception of textures. The aim of the present study was to develop a novel means to tag the cortical activity related to the processing of these vibrations, by periodically modulating the amplitude of texture exploration-induced vibrations such as to record a steady-state evoked potential (SS-EP). The EEG was recorded while the right index fingertip was scanned against four different textures using a constant exploration velocity. Amplitude modulation of the elicited vibrations was achieved by periodically modulating the force applied against the finger. Frequency analysis of the recorded EEG signals showed that modulation of the vibrations induced by the fingertip-texture interactions elicited an SS-EP at the frequency of modulation (3 Hz) as well as its second harmonic (6 Hz), maximal over parietal regions contralateral to the stimulated side. Textures generating stronger vibrations also generated SS-EPs of greater magnitude.

Using microscanning laser Doppler vibrometry, the tympanal mechanics of Cicada orni can be characterized in controlled acoustical conditions. The tympanum of C. orni moves following a simple drum-like motion, rather than the travelling wave found in a previous study of Cicadatra atra. There is a clear sexual dimorphism in the tympanal mechanics. The large male tympanum is unexpectedly insensitive to the dominant frequency of its own calling song, possibly a reflection of its dual purpose as a sound emitter and receiver. The small female tympanum appears to be mechanically sensitive to the dominant frequency of the male calling song and to high-frequency sound, a capacity never suspected before in these insects. This sexual dimorphism probably results from a set of selective pressures acting in divergent directions, which {{are linked to the}} different role of the sexes in sound reception and production.

In the present study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to record steady-state evoked brain potentials (SS-EPs) and characterize the cortical activity related to the passive tactile exploration of textured surfaces. In a first experiment, the right index fingertip was passively scanned against square-wave gratings having a spatial period (SP) ranging between 0. 4 and 1. 6 mm, using a constant normal force (1. 5 N) and two constant exploration velocities (17. 6 mm/s, 48 mm/s). The movement of the grating was achieved using a robot with a feedback force sensor. Depending on the SP, we expected that these dynamic stimuli would elicit SS-EPs at frequencies ranging between 11 and 120 Hz and, possibly, their harmonics. We found that consistent SS-EPs can be recorded at the lowest frequency (11 Hz). In a second experiment, the fingertip was scanned against a 3. 52 mm sinusoidal grating onto which a textured fabric was glued.
