The supporting structure is made of full interfloor plates, roof plate and the unconnected and connected walls with or without openings. Two dimensioned supporting elements, namely the ceiling panel in the 1 st floor and the wall with openings on the circumference of building, are analyzed in detail. The analysis of the load-bearing structure of the building is carried out by using two computational models. The first model, which serves {{for the analysis of}} the <b>ceiling</b> <b>plates,</b> is planar and is constructed by using the program SAP 2000. Another model, used to estimate oscillation of the structure and to analyze the vertical load-bearing elements of the building, is spatial and is made in the program ETABS. When analyzing the <b>ceiling</b> <b>plates,</b> the permanent and variable impact that affect perpendicular to the plane of the plate, are considered. The analysis of the vertical load-bearing elements, in addition to permanent and variable impacts that affect in vertical direction, also includes the impacts that affect the horizontal direction - the impacts of wind and earthquake. The computational models take into account the relevant design values of impacts and properties of the materials. The results of the analysis and dimensioning of the selected load-bearing elements are shown {{in the form of the}} text, tables, and the plans of the fixture...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the designing {{of the administrative}} building of CGP according to the current Eurocode standards {{in the field of}} constructions. Reinforced concrete construction consists of two parts which are separated with dilatation. The focus is {{on the part of the}} building that was built in 2007 and consists of the basement, the ground floor, two floors and the attic. The load-bearing construction of this five-storey building consists of monolith reinforced concrete plates and walls of reinforced concrete which are connected with beams. The analysis of vertical load-bearing elements was made with the use of the ETABS program, while the analysis of <b>ceiling</b> <b>plates</b> was performed with the SAFE program. In the analysis, permanent impacts, impacts of imposed loads, snow and wind loads, but also seismic effects were taken into consideration. Presented in detail is the designing of characteristic ceiling construction, the most loaded cantilever wall, and the wall and the beam from the system of connected walls. The presented vertical load-bearing elements are designed by the method of capacity design. The purpose of analysing an already built structure is to compare the quantity of reinforcement required by Eurocode standards with the actual reinforcement, established in accordance with the requirements of the Yugoslav regulations (JUS). The comparison indicated that a more accurate model used in this thesis has a greater effect on the quantity of reinforcement in ceiling construction than the difference in regulations. Nevertheless, the Eurocode standard requires longer boundary elements and significantly less reinforcement in the web of the wall. In beams that connect the walls, there are small differences between the quantities of built-in reinforcement and the reinforcement required by the Eurocode standard. Shear reinforcement is sufficient, only the distance between the bars is too big. The amounts and locations of reinforcement in analysed elements are shown in the reinforcement drawing. ...|$|R

In {{the vicinity of}} the lobby desk are a check room, attendant dispatch room, and elevators.

The women's facilities, considerably smaller in size, are {{at the south end of}} the building. Originally there was a 30 tub capacity. Although the men's and women's bath halls both have stained glass windows in aquatic motifs, the most impressive stained glass is the massive skylight in the men's area, with the DeSoto fountain centered on the floor directly below it. The second floor originally had dressing rooms, lockers, cooling rooms, and massage and mechano-therapy departments; now it is largely occupied by wood changing stalls, with entry to a centrally located quarry-tile courtyard for sunbathing. The third floor houses a massive ceramic-tiled Hubbard Currence therapeutic tub (a full body immersion whirlpool installed in 1938 when other hydrotherapeutic pools were also added), areas for men' s and women' s parlors, and a wood panelled gymnasium to the rear.

40|$|A {{system was}} {{developed}} to measure the sway of the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy Space Center. This system was installed in the VAB and gathered more than one total year of data. The building movement was correlated with measurements provided by three wind towers {{in order to determine}} the maximum deflection of the building during high-wind events. The VAB owners were in the process of obtaining new platforms for use in assembling very tall rockets when analysis of the VAB showed that a high wind could move the building sufficiently that an upper platform might impact a rocket. The problem arises because safety requires a relatively small gap between the platform and the rocket, while a large enough gap is needed to ensure that stacking tolerances prevent contact between the rocket and the platform. This only leaves an inch or two (approximately 2 to 5 cm) of total clearance, so when the analysis showed that more than a couple of inches of motion could occur in a high wind, there was a potential for damaging the rocket. The KSC Applied Physics Laboratory was asked to install a system in the VAB that could measure the motion of the building in high winds to determine the actual building sway. The motion of the VAB roof under wind load was measured optically, and under analysis, it was determined that a relatively large-aperture optical system would be required to reduce diffraction effects to less than a small fraction of an inch (approximately mm) at a distance of 500 ft (150 m). A 10 -in. (approximately 250 mm) telescope was placed on the floor of the building, looking at the ceiling. On the <b>ceiling,</b> a flat <b>plate</b> with three white LEDs was mounted in an "L" shape, such that the telescope was essentially looking at three stars. Software was written to track the motion of these three points using an image processing system. This provided a better than 1 / 10 -in. (approximately 2. 5 -mm) 2 D measurement faster than once a second. Data was downloaded once a month for comparison with the wind tower data. The system was fully operational and provided enough data to show that the VAB will only move 1 in. (approximately 2. 5 cm) at the ceiling under 70 -knot winds.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} static analysis of the load-bearing construction, built in 2008 {{as a part of}} the multi-residential building. Load-bearing construction is made out of reinforced concrete and consists of walls, walls with openings and deep beams which interconnect with the monolith horizontal plates. The design is carried out in accordance with the current Eurocode standards. The impacts, which affect the building as self-load and permanent loads, imposed loads, snow and wind loads and also seismic effects, are taken into account. When designing the load-bearing construction the focus is on analysis of typical load-bearing elements. Analysis is based on idealized computer models made in commercial programs SAFE (horizontal plate), ETABS (vertical load-bearing elements) and SAP (deep beam). The design of load bearing elements is done by the limit states method. Vertical load-bearing elements were however additionally designed in accordance with capacity design method. The purpose of the thesis is to compare the amount of reinforcement established in accordance with the Eurocode standards with the built-in reinforcement established under the old Yugoslav regulations PBAB. The comparison in the <b>ceiling</b> <b>plate</b> indicates that the deviation in the amount of the necessary and built-in reinforcement is due to differences in the accuracy of computational models. Deviations between built-in and necessary reinforcements in the deep beam are also consequences of a more accurate model used in the thesis. On that account, the amount of built-in reinforcement exceeds the amount of reinforcement established under Eurocodes; however the diagonal hanging reinforcement required in the juncture of transverse wall and deep beam is not built-in. The amount of reinforcement embedded in the wall without openings exceeds the amount of reinforcement defined under Eurocodes. When comparing vertical reinforcement in the wall between beams, we discover that less reinforcement is built-in than required by Eurocodes. Also, the amount of built-in shear reinforcement in the specified beam is smaller than amount calculated in the thesis. Analysis and design results are presented in the reinforcement drawings enclosed at the end of the thesis...|$|E
