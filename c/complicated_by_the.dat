5|$|Huggins {{fell ill}} on September 20, 1929, and checked into Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center for erysipelas. His {{condition}} was <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> development of influenza with high fever.

5|$|Native (i.e., elemental) {{selenium}} {{is a rare}} mineral, {{which does}} not usually form good crystals, but, when it does, they are steep rhombohedra or tiny acicular (hair-like) crystals. Isolation of selenium is often <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of other compounds and elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} political environment was further <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> death of Paul Eyschen, {{who had been}} Prime Minister for 27 years. With his death came a string of short-lived governments, culminating in rebellion, and constitutional turmoil after the withdrawal of German soldiers.|$|E

5|$|By 14:00 the 4th Parachute Brigade was {{no further}} forward. With {{casualties}} mounting, Brigadier Hackett asked General Urquhart's permission to withdraw {{south of the}} railway line. His intention was to move through Wolfheze and into Oosterbeek where the division's support units waited. The change of direction was further <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of vehicle crossings along the railway line—there were only two, one at Wolfheze and the other at Oosterbeek.|$|E
5|$|Historian Brian Jones concludes in The Emperor Domitian that {{assessing}} {{the true nature}} of Domitian's personality is inherently <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bias of the surviving sources. Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence. He appears to have lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes self-deprecating sense of humour, and often communicated in cryptic ways.|$|E

5|$|Identification of {{the film}} in showings and reviews is <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{existence}} of Pat Power's The Woman Hater. Though it bears the same name, the film was released on November 26, 1910. It was the Powers film that was rediscovered in New Zealand in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, a fire {{broke out}} that {{destroyed}} over 2,500 huts, home to nearly 3,500 families and 17,000 total people. The disaster highlighted the need for proper fire prevention in the largely wooden-built squatter areas, <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of political ties with the colonial and Chinese governments. The ruins gave new arrivals to the Walled City the opportunity to build anew, causing speculation that the fire may have been intentionally set.|$|E
5|$|Meredith recovers {{enough to}} start seeing Nathan Riggs, Owen Hunt's former best friend, by season 13, {{although}} their relationship is <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that Maggie confesses to Meredith that she has feelings for Riggs and Meredith {{is not ready to}} declare their relationship formally or publicly. Eventually she accepts her relationship with Riggs, but it's <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> unexpected return of Owen's sister, Megan Hunt, Riggs' fiancée. Meredith finds herself in another love triangle when Megan rejects Riggs because he is still in love with Meredith, but Meredith pushes them to be together. After her relationship with Riggs ends, Meredith is nominated for a Harper Avery Award for her groundbreaking surgery on Megan. In the penultimate 300th episode, after failing to attend the award ceremony to stay for a medical trauma, post surgery Meredith learns with all her closest friends in the OR room thag she has won the Harper Avery Award.|$|E
25|$|Complications of {{pre-eclampsia}} {{can affect}} both {{the mother and}} the fetus.

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of AS is <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> use of several different screening instruments, including the Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale (ASDS), Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST) (previously called the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test), Gilliam Asperger's disorder scale (GADS), Krug Asperger's Disorder Index (KADI), and the Autism-spectrum quotient (AQ; with versions for children, adolescents and adults).

5|$|Urinary tract {{symptoms}} are frequently {{lacking in the}} elderly. The presentations may be vague with incontinence, a change in mental status, or fatigue as the only symptoms, while some present to a health care provider with sepsis, an infection of the blood, as the first symptoms. Diagnosis can be <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that many elderly people have preexisting incontinence or dementia.|$|E
5|$|A 1990 CDOT design {{proposal}} for a new bridge was dropped after heavy opposition. In 2004 the city of Aspen {{and the town of}} Snowmass jointly funded design work for another new bridge. CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried during winter.|$|E

5|$|A {{group in}} Cambridge, which {{met at the}} White Horse tavern from the mid-1520s and became known as Little Germany, soon became influential. Its members {{included}} Robert Barnes, Hugh Latimer, John Frith and Thomas Bilney—all eventually burned as heretics. Cranmer's change of mind, borne partly by his membership of the team negotiating for the annulment, finally came through his stay with Andreas Osiander in Nuremberg in 1532. (Cranmer also secretly married Osiander's niece). Even then the position was <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that Lutherans were not in favour of the annulment. Cranmer (and Henry) felt obliged to seek assistance from Strasbourg and Basel, which brought him {{into contact with the}} more radical ideas associated with Zwingli.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of laws were invoked {{in the process of}} the suppression, from general treason to charges of book burning or {{demolishing}} houses, a process <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> relatively narrow definition of treason at the time. The use of informants and denunciations became common, causing fear to spread across the country; by November at least 1,500 people had been executed or killed in battle. Many of those who had lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal compensation, and John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track down those responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace. Most had only limited success, as the defendants were rarely willing to attend court. The last of these cases was resolved in 1387.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} bidding, TETCO raised {{the money to}} pay the {{government}} through a combination of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which was <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, who feared they would lose sales, but it eventually relented and the sale of the pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. The value of the company soared, and the original investors saw the value of their holdings increase 63-fold.|$|E

5|$|Although Tacitus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor. In his biographical work Agricola, Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to dismantle or tow the stern to sea failed, the State of Oregon still intended {{to see the}} remainder of the vessel removed from the beach. In 2006, the state's lawsuit against the ship's owners was settled, clearing the legal obstacles that prevented removal and providing the funds necessary to finance the project. Removal plans were <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that the stern had become deeply embedded in the sand in the seven years since the wreck, with some portions of the stern estimated to be 2030feet (69m) below the sand line.|$|E
5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis of depression is <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a generalized anxiety disorder to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. They contribute to impaired {{quality of life and}} increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E
