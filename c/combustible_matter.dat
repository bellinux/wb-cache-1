40|$|In the contribution, {{methods of}} {{separating}} metals  Fe, Al, Ge from energetic wastes  fly ashes are presented along with further possibilities of utilization of particular valuable components for industrial purposes. In the contribution, properties of energetic wastes are presented influencing the contents, separability, and utilizability of metal-bearing valuable components. From among physical properties these are {{grain size distribution}} and surface area. Chemical properties are characterized by elements contained in combusted coal whose content after combustion is increased 2 to 4 times, depending {{on the content of}} ash and <b>combustible</b> <b>matters</b> in original coal. Mineralogical properties of energetic wastes are determined by the combustion process conditions in the course of which mineral novelties are produced in concentrations suitable for separation. In the contribution, methods of separation and utilization of metals such as Fe, Al, Ge are described. From literature information on the processing of Fe component, as well as from results of experiments made at the Department of Mineral Processing and Environmental Protection, Technical University of Kosice follows that the highest concentration and mass yield of the component can be obtained from black coal fly ashes produced in smelting boilers. The content of Al in Slovak energetic wastes is lower than the 30 % Al 2 O 3 limit that conditions an economic technological processing. Only in the case of black coal fly ash from TEKO Kosice and EVO Vojany was the Al 2 O 3 content of 32. 93 %. Therefore, in an indirect way  by separating the residues of uncombusted coal and magnetite Fe  the content of Al in fly ash was increased. For Ge, a principle of selective sizing has been utilized. A complex utilization of energetic wastes, that is the separation of metallic components, elimination of particular metals and the subsequent treatment of nonmetallic residue, should be an effective solution in various industrial areas...|$|R

40|$|Time for Reflection (TFR) was {{designed}} at {{the inception of}} the Scottish Parliament in 1999, as an alternative to Westminster Anglican prayers, to provide a weekly opportunity for representatives of religions and belief systems to address the Par-liament. Appearances are designed to reflect the diversity of belief in proportion to relative support in the country as evident in the 2001 census. Christian contri-butions predominate and the Church of Scotland yields places to other main-stream Christian denominations but even then the full diversity of Christian belief is not accommodated as pentecostal churches tend to be excluded. Non-Christian religions appear far more frequently than their population justifies stat-istically and secular and humanist belief is greatly under-represented. Significant guidance and restrictions exercised over religious expression in TFR suggest the emergence of a wide but bounded national state civil religion which is not fully sensitive to the much wider variety of religious and related belief in Scotland. Results from the 2011 census will in 2012 provide an opportunity to reassess its organisation and the relative contributions of denominations, religions and other belief systems to TFR. New legislatures do not come into being very often. When they do, they provide interesting insights into the influences that guide legislators as to their relation-ship with the environing society that has contributed, or assented, to the estab-lishment of the new body. The Scottish Parliament established in 1999 was intended by its proponents to launch a new closer and more participatory rela-tionship between the people of Scotland and its new legislature—in explicit con-trast to what were seen as the distant and less responsive relationship of the Scottish population with the Westminster UK Parliament.

60|$|Such, for instance, {{was one of}} the {{mistakes}} committed in the celebrated phlogistic theory; a doctrine which accounted for combustion by the extrication of a substance called phlogiston, supposed to be contained in all <b>combustible</b> <b>matter.</b> The hypothesis accorded tolerably well with superficial appearances; the ascent of flame naturally suggests the escape of a substance; and the visible residuum of ashes, in bulk and weight, generally falls extremely short of the combustible material. The error was, non-observation of an important portion of the actual residue, namely, the gaseous products of combustion. When these were at last noticed and brought into account, it appeared to be a universal law, that all substances gain instead of losing weight by undergoing combustion; and after the usual attempt to accommodate the old theory to the new fact by means of an arbitrary hypothesis (that phlogiston had the quality of positive levity instead of gravity), chemists were conducted to the true explanation, namely, that instead of a substance separated, there was, on the contrary, a substance absorbed.|$|E
40|$|Boreal {{ecosystems}} {{contain a}} substantial {{fraction of the}} earth's soil carbon stores and are prone to frequent and severe wildfires. In this study, we examine changes in element and organic matter stocks due to a 1999 wildfire in Alaska. One year after the wildfire, burned soils contained between 1071 and 1420 g/m(2) less carbon than unburned soils. Burned soils had lower nitrogen than unburned soils, higher calcium, and nearly unchanged potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus stocks. Burned surface soils tended to have higher concentrations of noncombustible elements such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus compared with unburned soils. Combustion losses of carbon were mostly limited to surface dead moss and fibric horizons, with {{no change in the}} underlying mineral horizons. Burning caused significant changes in soil organic matter structure, with a 12 % higher ratio of carbon to <b>combustible</b> organic <b>matter</b> in surface burned horizons compared with unburned horizons. Pyrolysis gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy also shows preferential volatilization of polysaccharide-derived organic matter and enrichment of lignin- and lipid-derived compounds in surface soils.

A TG–DTA test was conducted using a TG–DTA analyzer (DTG– 60 Bruker AXS) specifically for studying the <b>combustible</b> organic <b>matter</b> on coal surface at early stage. Briefly, the semi-anthracitic coal sample and treated coal was milled to less than 75  µm and it passed through 200 mesh screens.

40|$|International audienceThe {{automobile}} {{shredder residues}} “ASR” represents a heterogeneous material generated during the shredding {{process of the}} end-of-life vehicles “ELV”. The ASR, while reactive enough to be classified as hazardous waste, could {{be considered as a}} source of energy and reducing agents, since it contains an appreciated <b>combustible</b> hydrocarbon <b>matter,</b> especially plastics. In this context, the present work provides an alternative approach for the thermal valorization of the ASR in iron and steel making operations. Plastics and ASR samples from an European automobile shredder company were collected and their thermal behaviors were studied at temperatures lower than and or equal to 900 °C. Appropriated mixtures of these samples with iron oxides were isothermally treated between 300 °C and 1050 °C for different reaction times. Initial samples as well as solid reaction products were subjected to different analysis methods. The direct reduction of hematite into metallic iron, at 1000 - 1050 °C, by plastics and ASR hydrocarbons was proved. The reduction steps, the possible reaction mechanisms and the behavior of several tramp and harmful elements were also discussed. Experimental results and thermodynamic predictions suggest that the thermal route can be a promised choice for the valorization of the wasted organic materials. Thermal processing overcome the difficulties and costly operations related to the ultimate removal of lead, zinc and copper compounds by physical means from these wastes. Reactions of chlorine, coming especially from PVC, with these metallic compounds generate their respective chlorides which are volatilized at relatively low temperatures leaving behind an appropriate matter to be introduced in different units of iron metallurgy...|$|R

In the process, two phases (solid and gas) combustion becomes into one phase (gas) combustion. Due to inadequate primary air and low temperature of semi-gasification chamber (550 - 750 ℃), all the ash was loose and no slag was found. Moreover, combustible gas produced was directly completely burned off and no tar appeared in the emissions. According to the result, the combustion thermal efficiency of clean stove (75 %) is up to 75 % and higher than primary stove (below 12 %) ...|$|R

60|$|Finally, {{the facts}} given {{in this chapter}} prove in how close and {{remarkable}} a manner the germ of a fertilised seed and the small cellular mass forming a bud, resemble each other in all their functions--in their power of inheritance with occasional reversion,--and in their capacity for variation of the same general nature, in obedience to the same laws. This resemblance, or rather identity of character, {{is shown in the}} most striking manner {{by the fact that the}} cellular tissue of one species or variety, when budded or grafted on another, may give rise to a bud having an intermediate character. We have seen that variability does not depend on sexual generation, though much more frequently its concomitant than of bud reproduction. We have seen that bud-variability is not solely dependent on reversion or atavism to long-lost characters, or to those formerly acquired from a cross, but appears often to be spontaneous. But when we ask ourselves what is the cause of any particular bud-variation, we are lost in doubt, being driven in some cases to look to the direct action of the external conditions of life as sufficient, and in other cases to feel a profound conviction that these have played a quite subordinate part, of not more importance than the nature of the spark which ignites a mass of <b>combustible</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E
6000|$|To recur {{once again}} to bud-variations. When we reflect on the {{millions}} of buds which many trees have produced, before some one bud has varied, we are lost in wonder {{as to what the}} precise cause of each variation can be. Let us recall the case given by Andrew Knight of the forty-year-old tree of the yellow magnum bonum plum, an old variety which has been propagated by grafts on various stocks for a very long period throughout Europe and North America, and on which a single bud suddenly produced the red magnum bonum. We should also bear in mind that distinct varieties, and even distinct species,--as in the case of peaches, nectarines, and apricots,--of certain roses and camellias,-- although separated by a vast number of generations from any progenitor in common, and although cultivated under diversified conditions, have yielded by bud-variation closely analogous varieties. When we reflect on these facts we become deeply impressed with the conviction that in such cases the nature of the variation depends but little on the conditions to which the plant has been exposed, and not in any especial manner on its individual character, but much more on the inherited nature or constitution of the whole group of allied beings to which the plant in question belongs. We are thus driven to conclude that in most cases the conditions of life play a subordinate part in causing any particular modification; like that which a spark plays, when a mass of combustibles bursts into flame--the nature of the flame depending on the <b>combustible</b> <b>matter,</b> and not on the spark.

60|$|But {{if there}} be a {{punishment}} prepared for the body distinct in kind from that which is prepared for the soul, yet {{it must be a}} punishment inferior to that which is prepared for the soul; not that the soul and body shall be severed, but being made of things distinct, their punishments will be by that which is most suitable to each. I say, it must be inferior, because nothing can be so hot, so tormenting, so intolerably insupportable, as the quickest apprehensions of, and the immediate sinking under, that guilt and indignation that is proportional to the offence. Should all the wood, and brimstone, and <b>combustible</b> <b>matter</b> on earth be gathered together for the tormenting of one body, yet that cannot yield that torment to that which the sense of guilt and burning-hot application of the indignation of God will do to the soul; yea, suppose the fire wherewith the body is tormented in hell should be seven times hotter than any of our fire; yea, suppose it, again, to be seven times hotter than that which is seven times hotter than ours, yet it must, suppose it to be but created fire, be infinitely short, as to tormenting operations, of the unspeakable wrath of God, when in the heat thereof He applieth it to, and doth punish the soul for sin in hell therewith. So, then, whether the body be tormented with the same fire wherewith the soul is tormented, or whether the fire be of another kind, yet it is not possible that it should bear the same punishment as to degree, because, or for the causes I have showed. Nor, indeed, is it meet it should, because the body has not sinned so, so grievously as the soul has done; and God proportioneth the punishment suitable to the offence.|$|E

When {{the door is}} shut against thee, it will open no more, and then repentings, desires, wishings, and wouldings, come all too late (Luke 13). Good may be done to others, but to thee, none; and this shall be because, even because thou hast {{withstood}} the time of thy visitation, and not received grace when offered: 'My God will cast them away, {{because they did not}} hearken unto him' (Luke 19:41-43; Hosea 9:17). Cain was driven out from the presence of God, for aught I know, some hundreds of years before his death; Ishmael was cast away after seventeen years of age; Esau lived thirty or forty years after he had sold his birthright. O! many, very many are in this condition! for though God be gracious, yet he will not be slighted nor abused always; there are plenty of sinners in the world--if one will not, another will. Christ was soon repulsed by and sent away from the country of the Gadarenes; but {{on the other side of}} the sea there were many ready with joy to receive him (Luke 8:37,40). So, when the Jews contradicted and blasphemed, 'the Gentiles gladly received the word' (Acts 13:46-48). Look to it, sinner, here is life and death set before thee; life, if it be not too late to receive it; but if it be, it is not too late for death to swallow thee up. And tell me, will it not be dreadful to be carried from under the gospel to the damned, there to lie in endless torment, because thou wouldst not be delivered therefrom?[39] Will it be comfort to thee to see the Saviour turn Judge? to see him that wept and died for the sin of the world now ease his mind on Christ-abhorring sinners by rendering to them the just judgment of God? For all their abominable filthiness, had they closed with Christ, they had been shrouded from the justice of the law, and should not have come into condemnation. 'But had been passed from death to life'; but they would not take shelter there; they would venture to meet the justice of God in its fury, wherefore now it shall swallow them up for ever and ever. And let me ask further, is not he a madman who, being loaded with <b>combustible</b> <b>matter,</b> will run headlong into the fire upon a bravado? or that, being guilty of felony or murder, will desperately run himself into the hand of the officer, as if the law, the judge, the sentence, execution, were but a jest, or a thing to be played withal? And yet thus mad are poor, wretched, miserable sinners, who, flying from Christ as if he were a viper, they are overcome, and cast off for ever by the just judgment of the law. But ah! how poorly will these be able to plead the virtues of the law to which they have cleaved, when God shall answer them, 'Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised' (Eze 32:19).

The better to effectuate my design, I procured a Tartar's sheep-skin robe, a bonnet, with bow and arrows, and every one of us got the like habits, the first night we spent in mixing <b>combustible</b> <b>matter</b> with aqua vitae, gunpowder, &c. having a good quantity of tar in a little pot: next night we came up to the idol about eleven o'clock, the moon being up. We found none guarding it; but we perceived a light in the house, where we had seen the priests before. One of our men was for firing the hut, another for killing the people, and a third for making them prisoners, while the idol was destroyed. We agreed to the latter; so knocking at the door, we seized the first that opened it, and stopping his mouth and tying his feet, we left him. We served the other two in the like manner; and then the Scots merchant set fire to the composition, which frightened them so much, that we brought them all away prisoners to their wooden god. There we fell to work with him, daubing him all over with tar mixed with tallow and brimstone stopping his eyes, ears, and mouth full of gunpowder, with a great piece of wild-fire in his bonnet, and environed it with dry forage. All this being done, we unloosed and ungagged the prisoners, and set the idol on fire, which the gunpowder blowing up, the shape of it was deformed, rent and split, which the forage utterly consumed; for we staid to see its destruction, lest the ignorant idolatrous people should have thrown themselves into the flames, And thus we came away undiscovered, in the morning appearing as busy among our fellow travellers, as no body could have suspected any other, but that we had been in our beds all night.|$|E

50|$|Efficiency of the {{gasifier}} {{system is}} relatively high. The gasification stage converts about 75% of fuel energy content into a combustible gas {{that can be}} used as a fuel for internal combustion engines. Based on long-term practical experiments and over 100,000 km driven with a wood gas-powered car, the energy consumption has been 1.54 times higher compared to the energy demand of the same car on petrol, excluding the energy needed to extract, transport and refine the oil from which petrol is derived, and excluding the energy to harvest, process, and transport the wood to feed the gasifier. This means that 1000 kg of wood <b>combustible</b> <b>matter</b> has been found to substitute 365 litres of petrol during real transportation in similar driving conditions and with the same, otherwise unmodified, vehicle. This can be considered to be a good result, because no other refining of the fuel is required. This study also considers all possible losses of the wood gas system, like preheating of the system and carrying of the extra weight of the gas-generating system. In power generation, reported demand of fuel is 1.1 kg wood <b>combustible</b> <b>matter</b> per kilowatt-hour of electricity.|$|E

The Thames offered water for firefighting and the chance of escape by boat, but the poorer districts along the riverfront had stores and cellars of combustibles which increased the fire risk. All along the wharves, the rickety wooden tenements and tar paper shacks of the poor were shoehorned amongst [...] "old paper buildings and the most <b>combustible</b> <b>matter</b> of tarr, pitch, hemp, rosen, and flax which was all layd up thereabouts." ...|$|E

She drifted and ran aground half a mile to the northward of the citadel and burnt to the water line. An inquiry subsequently concluded that the fire had been accidentally put on by a [...] "bottle of <b>combustible</b> <b>matter</b> improperly kept in the carpenters cabin", and acquitted the officers from blame.|$|E
50|$|At the inquest {{into the}} explosion, the jury {{returned}} the verdict that the explosion {{had been the}} result of methane being ignited by the firing of a shot and that no case of negligence attached to anyone connected. However the inquest did observe that the face had not received thorough treatment with inert dust, as the area around the explosion contained between 45.2% and 71.2% <b>combustible</b> <b>matter</b> within dust samples taken on the following day; and that the three shot dynamo used for firing did not comply with the Explosives in Coal Mines Order and should not have been used.|$|E
50|$|In a {{gasoline}} engine, this inert exhaust displaces {{the amount of}} <b>combustible</b> <b>matter</b> in the cylinder. In a diesel engine, the exhaust gas replaces some of the excess oxygen in the pre-combustion mixture. Because NOx forms primarily when a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen is subjected to high temperature, the lower combustion chamber temperatures caused by EGR reduces the amount of NOx the combustion generates (though at some loss of engine efficiency). Gases re-introduced from EGR systems will also contain near equilibrium concentrations of NOx and CO; the small fraction initially within the combustion chamber inhibits the total net production {{of these and other}} pollutants when sampled on a time average. Most modern engines now require exhaust gas recirculation to meet emissions standards. Chemical properties of different fuels limit how much EGR may be used. For example methanol is more tolerant to EGR than gasoline.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} {{conditions}} for flotation of low rank coal (lignite of Tuncbilek, Turkey) were investigated in detail. The experiments were performed using the 3 -variable 2 -level (23) full factorial experimental design with four base point replicates, {{and the results}} were analyzed by the regression model, Fischer test (F-test) and Halbich’s upgrading curve for the responses of ash content (or <b>combustible</b> <b>matter</b> grade) and the <b>combustible</b> <b>matter</b> recovery. The results obtained from the analysis indicated that while every factor considerably affected the <b>combustible</b> <b>matter</b> recovery, both collector (kerosene) and frother (AF 65) significantly influenced the ash contents of the carbonaceous matter products. The only effective mutual interaction influencing recovery was caused by the kerosene-aeration interaction, while the interaction of kerosene-aeration and kerosene-AF 65 and interactions of all factors (kerosene-AF 65 -aeration) were significant for the ash content of the products. Basing on the grade– recovery Halbich upgrading curve, regression model and a criterion for optimum of flotation results, it was found that a coal product with <b>combustible</b> <b>matter</b> grade of 91. 09 % and 71 % <b>combustible</b> <b>matter</b> recovery can be obtained provided that it is processed at the higher level of kerosene (3 kg/Mg), higher level of frother AF 65 (40 ppm) and lower aeration rate level of (0. 16 cm/s).
