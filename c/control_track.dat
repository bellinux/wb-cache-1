500|$|Fantasound, {{developed}} {{in part by}} Disney engineer William Garity, employed two projectors running at the same time. With one containing the picture film with a mono soundtrack for backup purposes, the other ran a sound film that was mixed from the eight tracks recorded at the Academy to four: three of which contained the audio for the left, center, and right stage speakers respectively, while the fourth became a <b>control</b> <b>track</b> with amplitude and frequency tones that drove variable-gain amplifiers to control {{the volume of the}} three audio tracks. In addition were three [...] "house" [...] speakers placed on the left, right, and center of the auditorium that derived from the left and right stage channels which acted as surround channels. As the original recording was captured at almost peak modulation to increase signal-to-noise ratio, the <b>control</b> <b>track</b> was used to restore the dynamics to where Stokowski thought they should be. For this, a tone-operated gain-adjusting device was built to control the levels of each of the three audio tracks through the amplifiers.|$|E

500|$|The {{illusion}} of sound traveling across the speakers was achieved with a device named the [...] "pan pot", which directed the predetermined movement of each audio channel with the <b>control</b> <b>track.</b> Mixing of the soundtrack required six people {{to operate the}} various pan pots in real time, while Stokowski directed each level and pan change which was marked on his musical score. To monitor recording levels, Disney used oscilloscopes with color differentiation to minimize eye fatigue. To test recording equipment and speaker systems, Disney ordered eight electronic oscillators from the newly established Hewlett-Packard company. Between the individual takes, prints, and remakes, approximately three million feet of sound film {{was used in the}} production of Fantasia. Almost a fifth of the film's budget was spent on its recording techniques.|$|E

2500|$|On 7 May 1942 Hitler ordered {{development}} of a simple, low-speed, half-track, load-carrying vehicle for use on the Eastern Front. Büssing-NAG was selected {{to develop a new}} [...] tractor (Zgkw. 5t neuer Art) to replace the earlier 5 tonne Sd.Kfz. 6 and [...] Sd.Kfz. 11 half-tracks, as well as the various lesser-known vehicles of the same class. Production started in December 1943 at Büssing-NAG. Early examples used a truck-like, unarmored cabin similar to the earlier half-tracks it replaced, while later examples featured an armored cabin and engine compartment that looked similar to the Sd.Kfz. 251 armored personnel carrier. Like the earlier Demag-designed Sd.Kfz. 10, the sWS's suspension system consisted of five double roadwheels per side, overlapping and interleaved in the [...] layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. One idler wheel, mounted at the rear end of each track unit, was used to <b>control</b> <b>track</b> tension.|$|E

2500|$|All lines but the Yellow Line are {{equipped}} with automatic train control. Generally, the train operator does the closing of doors and starts the DA (Départ automatique, automatic departure), and then the train drives itself. The train operator can also drive the train manually {{at his or her}} discretion. Signalling is effected through coded pulses sent through the rails. Coded speed orders and station stop positions transmitted through track beacons are captured by beacon readers mounted under the driver cabs. The information sent to the train's electronic modules conveys speed information, and {{it is up to the}} train automatic control system computer to conform to the imposed speed. Additionally, the train computer can receive energy-saving instructions from track beacons, providing the train with four different economical coasting modes, plus one mode for maximum performance. In case of manual <b>control,</b> <b>track</b> speed is displayed on the cab speedometer indicating the maximum permissible speed. The wayside signals consist of point (switch/turnout) position indicators in proximity to switches and inter-station signalling placed at each station stop. Trains often reach their maximum speed of [...] in 16 to 26 seconds depending on grade and load.|$|E

50|$|A <b>control</b> <b>track</b> is a {{track that}} runs along an outside {{edge of a}} {{standard}} analog videotape (including VHS). The <b>control</b> <b>track</b> encodes a series of pulses, each pulse corresponding {{to the beginning of}} each frame. This allows the video tape player to synchronize its scan speed and tape speed to the speed of the recording. Thus, the recorded <b>control</b> <b>track</b> defines the speed of playback (e.g. SP, LP, EP, etc.), and it is also what drives the relative counter clock that most VCRs have.|$|E
50|$|Audio {{cannot be}} {{recorded}} on a VHS tape without recording a video signal, {{even in the}} audio dubbing mode.

Some early VCRs would record audio without a <b>control</b> <b>track</b> signal, but this was of little practical use since {{the absence of a}} <b>control</b> <b>track</b> signal meant that the linear tape speed was irregular during playback.|$|E

Prior work has studied this in the abstract; in contrast, we collected browsing histories from and interviewed 35 people about the perceived benefits and risks of online tracking {{in the context of their}} own browsing behavior. We find that many users want more <b>control</b> over <b>tracking</b> and think that <b>controlled</b> <b>tracking</b> has benefits, but are unwilling to put in the effort to <b>control</b> <b>tracking</b> or distrust current tools. We confirm previous findings that users’ general attitudes about tracking are often at odds with their comfort in specific situations. We also identify specific situational factors that contribute to users’ preferences about online tracking and explore how and why. Finally, we examine a sample of popular tools for <b>controlling</b> <b>tracking</b> and show that they only partially address the situational factors driving users’ preferences. We suggest opportunities to improve such tools, and explore the use of a classifier to automatically determine whether a user would be comfortable with tracking on a particular page visit; our results suggest this is a promising direction for future work...|$|R
