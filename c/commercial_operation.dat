5|$|Sarnia is the {{location}} of Enbridge's Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant. The facility went into full <b>commercial</b> <b>operation</b> in December 2009, with 20 MW of power. , the plant was the largest photovoltaic (PV) solar power generation facility in the world, putting out 97 MW.|$|E
5|$|Comparing {{the driver}} energy input to the fusion energy output {{produces}} a number known as fusion energy gain factor, labelled Q. A Q value {{of at least}} 1 {{is required for the}} system to produce net energy. Since some energy is needed to run the reactor, in order for there to be net electrical output, Q has to be at least 3. For <b>commercial</b> <b>operation,</b> Q values much higher than this are needed. For ICF, Qs on the order of 25 to 50 are needed to recoup both the electrical generation losses and the large amount of power used to power the driver. In the fall of 1960, theoretical work carried out at LLNL suggested that gains of the required order would be possible with drivers on the order of 1MJ.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} making beer is known as brewing. A {{dedicated}} building for the making of beer is called a brewery, though beer {{can be made in}} the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer is made in the home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries, which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a <b>commercial</b> <b>operation</b> only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the US in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.|$|E

5|$|Weather ship {{observations}} {{proved to}} be helpful in wind and wave studies, as commercial shipping tended to avoid weather systems for safety reasons, whereas the weather ships did not. They were also helpful in monitoring storms at sea, such as tropical cyclones. Beginning in the 1970s, their role was largely superseded by weather buoys because of the ships' significant cost. The removal of a weather ship became a negative factor in forecasts {{leading up to the}} Great Storm of 1987. The last weather ship was Polarfront, known as weather station M ("Mike"), which was removed from operation on January 1, 2010. Weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine <b>commercial</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each boiler powered a turbo generator, made by Parsons, Newcastle upon Tyne. These were three-cylinder {{reaction}} type {{steam turbines}} operating at 3,000rpm, generating 60MW of electricity. The stations used {{them because of}} a Statutory Order of the Ministry of Supply in November 1947 that all turbo alternators made for the home market could only be of 60MW at advanced steam conditions. Stella South had a total generating capacity of 300MW and Stella North originally 240MW (later recorded as only 224MW). The stations {{were the first to}} use silica removal beds in their turbines, a development which became standard within the CEGB's power stations for some time. In 1967, one of the sets at Stella South became the world's first in <b>commercial</b> <b>operation</b> to use brushless excitation. The set was modified by Parsons to use A.C. exciters and silicon diode rectifiers. The stations' switchgear was manufactured by A. Reyrolle & Company.|$|E
5|$|It has {{a number}} of {{employees}} available, with Fred Legace serving as airport manager and a number of maintenance workers serving the airport; Ed Ratuski also manages it. The Kamloops Airport has been owned by a number of companies since its opening. It was initially owned by the RCAF, but later there was a proposal led the RCAF to transfer airport ownership to Kamloops itself, hence why the name was changed to the Kamloops Airport, although it is commonly referred to as Fulton Field or Fulton Airport. During the 1990s, Transport Canada, the owner at that time, began a program to transfer ownership of selected regional airports and the ownership of the Kamloops Airport was transferred to the then-new Kamloops Airport Authority Society by August1997 which is a department of the Kamloops City Council and was composed of its members; it was deemed a <b>commercial</b> <b>operation.</b> Kamloops Airport Authority Society have a contract with the Vancouver Airport Authority, which allow them to manage and operate the airport. It is operated by Kamloops Airport Limited.|$|E

5|$|The Panama Canal had {{a limited}} {{capacity}} determined by operational times and cycles {{of the existing}} locks and further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal which take more transit time within the locks and navigational channels, {{and the need for}} permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal, which forces periodical shutdowns of this waterway. On the other hand, demand has been growing due to the rapid growth of international trade. Also, many users require a guarantee of certain level of service. Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the congestion problems was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of locks. Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter <b>commercial</b> <b>operation</b> in June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the current locks are capable of handling.|$|E
