5000|$|Color {{fastness}} is a term—{{used in the}} dyeing of textile materials—that characterizes a material's color's {{resistance to}} fading or running.

50|$|Solution dyeing, {{also known}} as dope or spun dyeing, {{is the process of}} adding {{pigments}} or insoluble dyes to the spinning solution before the solution is extruded through the spinneret. Only manufactured fibers can be solution-dyed. It is used for difficult-to-dye fibers, such as olefin fibers, and for dyeing fibers for end uses that require excellent <b>colorfastness</b> properties. Because the color pigments {{become a part of the}} fiber, solution-dyed materials have excellent <b>colorfastness</b> to light, washing, crocking (rubbing), perspiration, and bleach. Dyeing at the solution stage is more expensive, since the equipment has to be cleaned thoroughly each time a different color is produced. Thus, the variety of colors and shades produced is limited. In addition, it is difficult to stock the inventory for each color. Decisions regarding color have to be made very early in the manufacturing process. Thus, this stage of dyeing is usually not used for apparel fabrics.|$|E

30|$|In summary, mordanted {{black walnut}} and eastern redcedar dyed wool yarn had less color change {{compared}} to no mordant for <b>colorfastness</b> to light, while <b>colorfastness</b> to laundering had less change for nonmordanted. These findings {{are similar to}} prior research with black walnut bark dyed on wool gabardine fabric where mordanted had improved lightfastness with no difference between mordant treatment for exposure to laundering (Doty and Haar 2012). <b>Colorfastness</b> to laundering results for Osage orange indicated mordanted had less color change than nonmordanted, however exposed yarns were significantly darker instead of the more typical lightening of hue. While <b>colorfastness</b> to light for Osage orange was not significantly different, the overall color change was also slightly darker. This finding while unusual was not surprising as Osage orange is known to darken over time (Cardon 2007; Richards and Tyrl 2005).|$|E

30|$|The <b>colorfastness</b> to washing (color {{change and}} staining) showed a higher chance of commercialization in all {{manufactured}} and existing commercial denim fabrics. However, {{the results of}} <b>colorfastness</b> to light showed differently; the <b>colorfastness</b> of the denim fabrics that used the chemical dyestuff as the warp yarn was four grades above while that of the denim fabric that used the natural dyestuff was graded as grade 3 or grade 3 – 4. When compared with the existing denim fabric products (S 1, S 2), the developed denim fabrics using synthetic dyestuff as the warp yarn {{seemed to have no}} problem in merchandising. On the other hand, the <b>colorfastness</b> to light of the indigo natural dyestuff was lower than the chemical dyestuff, which indicated the stability against daylight was slightly lower. However, considering that denim fabric products such as jean pants and jean jackets were recognized as premium denim fabrics in which the indigo dyes gradually disappear in the course of repeated washing and dehydration, we believe that the denim fabric using the natural dyestuff as the warp is able to commercialize sufficiently.|$|E

40|$|Color {{fastness}} {{is important}} for satisfactory performance of textiles in use. Successful color fastness testing relies on accurate interpretation of published test methods, and control of laboratory conditions.

The AATCC does not have a verification standard for two of its most often-used <b>colorfastness</b> tests: Method 15 (<b>Colorfastness</b> to Perspiration) and Method 61 (<b>Colorfastness</b> to Laundering). A survey of dyes in the Colour Index was used to select candidate disperse, direct and acid dyes {{on the basis of their}} fiber suitability, fastness, availability, and hue. The dyes were applied individually to cotton or nylon as appropriate, and their fastness to perspiration and laundering assessed. The results were used to plan combinations of dye, which were applied to a nylon-cotton blend.

30|$|The {{influence}} of PAS on hue and <b>colorfastness</b> had mixed results. The PAS mordant had a warming effect {{on all of}} the dyewoods that was minimized for black walnut after laundering, while eastern redcedar’s cast was reduced after light exposure. Regardless of mordant type, Osage orange darkened from a golden yellow to a tan/brown following exposure to light. <b>Colorfastness</b> to light was enhanced with a PAS mordant for black walnut and eastern redcedar, while Osage orange had a significant difference from laundering but not for light. While any improvement to <b>colorfastness</b> is viewed as positive, the mixed results and subtle overall visual color difference from mordant use {{may not be enough to}} convince dyers to use a metallic mordant with tannin dyestuffs. The use of a mordant does mean another step in the dyeing process that uses water, energy, and may release unbound mordant chemicals into disposal systems, impacting both the environment and health of communities. Further, introduction of metallic mordant use may impact the cultural heritage of traditional dye practices. Conversely, understanding and utilizing a metallic mordant to shift color, improve lightfastness, and understand long term color results may create social value through new knowledge, as well as economic gain by addressing consumer concern over <b>colorfastness</b> of natural dyes.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 56 - 59) Textile {{products can}} be printed by several different methods. The method considered {{in this study}} is silk screen printing, an important resist process in present use. Therefore, this research was conducted to investigate the hypotheses that a selected sample of screen printed fabrics will exhibit high color fastness ratings as measured by standard test procedures; that consumers are interested in the <b>colorfastness</b> properties of textile products; and that consumers use their knowledge of screen printed textiles when making decisions concerning the purchase of' selected textile products. A questionnaire was developed to determine consumer interest in the <b>colorfastness</b> properties of printed textiles, consumer knowledge of screen printing, consumer interest in purchasing textile products having screen printed designs, and the influence of identifiable screen prints in the consumer???s decision to purchase textile products. This questionnaire was given to 100 women living in the San Fernando Valley in the Los Angeles area. Chi squares were computed {{with the use of a}} General Electric 445 computer. Twenty screen printed fabrics of various fiber content were selected and tested for color fastness to laundering, carbon-arc light, perspiration, and crocking. The fabric samples were evaluated using AATCC scales. The selected fabrics included swimwear, drapery, and apparel. Two of the four swimwear fabrics had good <b>colorfastness</b> qualities. The other two fabrics would not be considered colorfast. The four drapery fabrics generally were colorfast in each of the four tests. The 12 apparel woven and knit fabric is varied in color fastness qualities. Generally, the fabrics with wash and wear, fast color or a similar finish were more color fast in each of the tests. The type of dye used or lack of finish could be factors that would affect the <b>colorfastness</b> qualities. The method used to screen print did not seem to have any effect on the <b>colorfastness</b> qualities. Therefore, only some of the selected screen printed fabrics exhibited high color fastness ratings.

30|$|The <b>colorfastness</b> ratings against {{washing and}} {{perspiration}} in Tables  3 and 4 show that polyester fabrics dyed with henna dye have an almost identical fastness ratings of ‘very good’ to ‘excellent’ (within numerical grade 4 – 5 and 5) {{with a very}} little variation in the depth of shades. Again, no or a little staining of color onto adjacent multifiber fabric due to washing or perspiration signifies remarkable <b>colorfastness</b> properties of polyester fiber dyed with henna. Moreover, no significant change in color was observed in case of dry and wet rubbing of dyed fabric (Table  5). The excellent <b>colorfastness</b> properties against washing, perspiration and rubbing demonstrated by polyester fiber dyed with henna {{may be attributed to}} its highly crystalline structure and hydrophobic nature (Bhuiyan et al. 2017 a).

30|$|The triple {{bottom line}} can be {{impacted}} in {{both positive and negative}} ways by the use of tree sawmill waste as a natural dye. Trees contain a biomordant in the form of tannin which may eliminate the need for metallic mordants, thus reducing water, thermal energy, residual waste, and exposure to a mordant chemical. Dyeing with mill waste provides an economic option for an existing timber manufacturing byproduct. This research analyzed the impact of potassium aluminum sulfate (PAS) on dye concentration, hue, and <b>colorfastness</b> to light and laundering for three regional dyewoods (black walnut, Osage orange, and eastern redcedar) on wool yarn. Dye concentrations were pre-tested to find a standard depth of shade between mordanted and nonmordanted yarns. Tests for <b>colorfastness</b> to light and laundering were performed according to AATCC methods. Resulting colors for exposed and unexposed specimens were rated using CIE L*a*b* values and descriptive statistics were used to examine directional relationship within independent variables mordant and exposure (light and laundering). Two-sample t test was performed to investigate the effect of a PAS mordant versus no mordant on overall color difference between specimens exposed to light and laundering. Findings indicated that dye absorption was improved {{with the use of a}} PAS mordant. For yarns premordanted with PAS the dyewood colors became warmer. A PAS mordant slightly improved <b>colorfastness</b> to light for black walnut and eastern redcedar, but did not influence Osage orange which had a color change from bright yellow to warm brown after exposure to light. <b>Colorfastness</b> to laundering improved only for Osage orange with a PAS mordant.|$|E

30|$|Overall, <b>colorfastness</b> {{to light}} and {{laundering}} findings indicate mixed results for color change when using a PAS mordant for the selected mill waste, however any improvement to <b>colorfastness</b> is considered positive. Thus, using a PAS mordant may be preferable as lightfastness improved for black walnut and eastern redcedar, while washfastness improved for Osage orange. Improved <b>colorfastness</b> properties may enhance sell-ability of dyed products as consumer concern for color longevity is addressed. Environmentally and economically, {{the use of}} a premordant does increase cost and the amount of time, water, and thermal energy required. Future studies could evaluate adding the mordant to the dye bath, instead of as a pretreatment. As noted prior, there is growing concern over disposal of any residual manufactured metallic mordant {{and its impact on the}} environment and community health. As we did not measure the amount of remaining PAS mordant from a 12  % owf mordant bath, we cannot provide insight to this concern. A possible social impact of introducing use of a PAS mordant is that such practice may not be conducive to long standing natural dye traditions and if accepted could change a cultural heritage.|$|E

Pre-testing ensured dyeings of visually comparable color depth and dye concentrations were pre-tested to find a standard depth of shade between the same dye on PAS mordanted and nonmordanted wool yarns. Tests for <b>colorfastness</b> to light, laundering and staining were performed in accordance to AATCC test methods.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to find the suitable dyeing method for dyeing cotton fabric into indigo blue color using the raw indigo powder dyes sold in the Korean market. The research focused primarily on the comparison of the non-reduced dyeing method and the reduced dyeing method. The dyeing effects using different dyeing temperatures (2 ～ 80 ℃) and different concentrations of reducing agent and alkali were also investigated. It was found that the reduced dyeing method must be used for dyeing cotton into indigo blue color using the commercial raw indigo powder dyes. The best result was obtained by 20 ℃ dyeing with the 40 ℃ dyeing giving a comparable result. The intensity of the blue color could be enhanced by increasing the alkali concentration. The non-reduced dyeing could not dye cotton fabric into indigo blue color at any given dyeing temperatures (2 ～ 80 ℃). The reduce-dyed cotton fabrics showed a gradual color change upon repeated washing and extended sunlight exposure, the most color change occurring after the first two washing cycles and the first 5 hours of sunlight exposure. The standard tests of <b>colorfastness</b> showed that the reduce-dyed cotton fabrics had good to excellent <b>colorfastness</b> whereas the <b>colorfastness</b> of the non-reduce-dyed cotton fabrics were mostly poor...|$|E

Fashion and Textiles, 3, 16. doi: 10. 1186 /s 40691 - 016 - 0074 - 9 The {{triple bottom line}} can be impacted in {{both positive and negative}} ways by the use of tree sawmill waste as a natural dye. Trees contain a biomordant in the form of tannin which may eliminate the need for metallic mordants, thus reducing water, thermal energy, residual waste, and exposure to a mordant chemical. Dyeing with mill waste provides an economic option for an existing timber manufacturing byproduct. This research analyzed the impact of potassium aluminum sulfate (PAS) on dye concentration, hue, and <b>colorfastness</b> to light and laundering for three regional dyewoods (black walnut, Osage orange, and eastern redcedar) on wool yarn. Dye concentrations were pre-tested to find a standard depth of shade between mordanted and nonmordanted yarns. Tests for <b>colorfastness</b> to light and laundering were performed according to AATCC methods. Resulting colors for exposed and unexposed specimens were rated using CIE L*a*b* values and descriptive statistics were used to examine directional relationship within independent variables mordant and exposure (light and laundering). Two-sample t test was performed to investigate the effect of a PAS mordant versus no mordant on overall color difference between specimens exposed to light and laundering. Findings indicated that dye absorption was improved {{with the use of a}} PAS mordant. For yarns premordanted with PAS the dyewood colors became warmer. A PAS mordant slightly improved <b>colorfastness</b> to light for black walnut and eastern redcedar, but did not influence Osage orange which had a color change from bright yellow to warm brown after exposure to light. <b>Colorfastness</b> to laundering improved only for Osage orange with a PAS mordant...|$|E
30|$|The tensile {{properties}} and yarn {{count of the}} Hanji single yarn and combination yarn were measured according to KSK ISO 2062 and KSK ISO 2060 (Skein method) respectively. The <b>colorfastness</b> to washing and the dimensional change in washing and drying of the fabric were measured by KSK ISO 105 -C 06 (A 2 S) and KSK ISO 5077, respectively. The elastic recovery and <b>colorfastness</b> to light were measured by KSK 0352 and KSK ISO 105 -B 02 (Xenon arc). Drying velocity and absorption velocity were measured by KSK 0815 (6.28. 1 -A) and KSK 0815 (6.27. 1 -B), respectively. The surface structures of Hanji paper yarns and combination yarns were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and those of Hanji denim fabrics were measured by a video microscope system (Sometech Inc.). Fabric specific gravity was determined by mass per unit volume commonly expressed, in grams per cubic centimeter.|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Apparel, Textiles, and Interior DesignSherry J. HaarThe recent green {{movement}} has created {{strong interest in}} sustainable practices in the apparel and textile industry. Accordingly, natural dye usage has increased in popularity over the recent years, as well as alternative fiber sources such as bamboo. Because of the inherently poorer fastness properties of natural dyes compared to synthetic dyes, additional research on natural dyes and mordant agents is necessary to obtain the best <b>colorfastness</b> results. Many salts, called mordants, are used to help affix natural dyes to fabrics, called mordants, but the most common is potassium aluminum sulfate. However, {{it has been suggested}} that aluminum acetate can be a substitute, if not a better mordant than potassium aluminum sulfate for cellulose fibers. This study compared the <b>colorfastness</b> of these two mordants in three different amounts including 5 %, 10 %, and 20 % per weight of fiber (WOF). Three natural dye extracts (madder, weld, and coreopsis), were used to dye seven test fabrics, including a bamboo rayon jersey, two bamboo rayon woven fabrics, a cotton interlock knit, two woven cottons, and a bamboo rayon and cotton blend interlock knit. Lightfastness and <b>colorfastness</b> to laundering tests were conducted, and Gray Scale ratings were analyzed using ANOVA statistical analysis. This analysis showed significant four-way interaction between all variables. Results supported aluminum acetate as a more colorfast mordant for cellulose fibers. This research was supported in part by Agricultural Research Experiment Station at the Kansas State University...|$|E
