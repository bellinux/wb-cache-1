We show that such a space H has the form H=cl(U+∑jIj) with U a closed subspace of H 1 (the factor associated to the unit element in G), and any Ij a well described <b>closed</b> <b>graded</b> ideal of H, satisfying IjIk= 0 if j≠k. Under certain conditions, the graded simplicity of H is characterized and it is shown that H is {{the closure of the}} orthogonal direct sum of the family of its minimal (<b>closed)</b> <b>graded</b> ideals, each one being a graded simple graded Hilbert space...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} logical {{calculus}} which imposes a grading on a sequent-style calculus {{to account for}} the runtime of the programmes represented by the sequents. This system is sound for a notion of polynomial-time realizability. An extension of the grading is also considered, giving a notion of "dependant grades", which is also sound. Furthermore, we define a notion of <b>closed</b> <b>graded</b> multicategory, and show how the structure of polynomial-time realizers has that structure...|$|R

The key step is the construction of <b>closed</b> <b>graded</b> traces on certain differential algebras over the symbol algebra for this class of operators. Comment: 9 page...|$|R

40|$|Consider a pseudo-H-space E {{endowed with}} a {{separately}} continuous biadditive associative multiplication which induces a grading on E {{with respect to}} an abelian group G. We call such a space a graded pseudo-H-ring and we show that it has the form E = cl(U + ∑_j I_j) with U a closed subspace of E_ 1 (the summand associated to the unit element in G), and any I_j runs over a well described <b>closed</b> <b>graded</b> ideal of E, satisfying I_jI_k = 0 if j ≠ k.

40|$|Recent {{research}} shows that most Brazilian students have serious problems regarding their reading skills. The full development of this skill is key for the academic and professional future of every citizen. Tools for classifying the complexity of reading materials for children aim {{to improve the quality}} of the model of teaching reading and text comprehension. For English, Fengs work [11] is considered the state-of-art in grade level prediction and achieved 74 % of accuracy in automatically classifying 4 levels of textual complexity for <b>close</b> school <b>grades.</b> There are no classifiers for nonfiction texts for <b>close</b> <b>grades</b> in Portuguese. In this article, we propose a scheme for manual annotation of texts in 5 grade levels, which will be used for customized reading to avoid the lack of interest by students who are more advanced in reading and the blocking of those that still need to make further progress. We obtained 52 % of accuracy in classifying texts into 5 levels and 74 % in 3 levels. The results prove to be promising when compared to the state-of-art work. 9 Comment: PROPOR International Conference on the Computational Processing of Portuguese, 2016, 9 page...|$|R

50|$|The NYCRR, on the contrary, had posted record {{profits for}} 1923. The {{railroad}} finalized its electrification plans {{and brought it}} for the State approval in November and December 1924. The plan called for the electrification of the NYCRR West Side Line from St. John's Park to Spuyten Duyvil, Bronx but excluded the West Side freight network. Electrification of the freight network, whether by third rail or overhead lines, was impractical. The NYCRR effectively brought talks to a stalemate by demanding elimination of all grade crossings on the West Side, to allow the same standard of safety and engineering as on its other lines. In November 1925 NYCRR announced a plan to invest $30 million in the electrification of its West Side Line, contingent on the city's decision to <b>close</b> <b>grade</b> crossing. Discussion of this and similar unrealistic proposals dragged for another year.|$|R

Those students transferred to the public high school, which had a more competitive program with activities and curricular strengths, neither of which Sacred Heart's high school could compete with, only having 90-130 students during the last years.

5000|$|Today, the {{descendants}} of these Roman Catholic [...] "Barramen" [...] still dominate Central Cape Breton Island's Gaelic culture. The area is still heavily influenced by Catholicism and the local priest was the law. Gaelic was the first language of the community {{until the middle of}} the 20th century. A campaign of violence and intimidation by the provincial school board led to the near extermination of Gaelic culture and language in Cape Breton. However, there has been a resurgence of the Gaelic language and culture promulgated through a local Feis an Eilein http://www.feisaneilein.ca/ (Festival of the Island) and Highland Village Museum https://web.archive.org/web/20100921053416/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/hv/, a Provincial Nova Scotia Living Museum in nearby Iona. The Gaelic language is now being taught to children attending the Rankin School of the Narrows.

It is important to study this relationship because, if the relationship is not a <b>close</b> one, corn <b>grades</b> are failing to accomplish some of the objectives of grades. If the relationship is not <b>close,</b> present <b>grade</b> descriptions do not enable feeders to obtain the particular qualities they need, do not result in more meaningful price quotations to feeders, and do not separate products of low quality for feeding from those of high quality...|$|R
