Measurements were conducted with a 20 ° field and a 120 ° field. Adaptation period varied from 1 to 30 s with the smaller field and from 1 to 60 s with the larger field. <b>Colour</b> <b>shifts</b> were specified {{in terms of a}} modified Brunswik ratio (BR). Higher values of BR were associated with longer adaptation periods but only when the larger background was used. Supplementary experiments showed that the changes in colour appearance were related to a slight shift in the perceived colour of the background. The timing of the <b>colour</b> <b>shifts</b> are modelled in terms of cone opponent responses. High values of BR correspond to almost complete von Kries adaptation in all three cone types...|$|R

Two sets of spectral power distributions (SPDs), with five SPDs in each, had similar relative-gamut indices of 121 and 111, respectively, but different gamut shapes, shape of the polygon created from the chromaticities of colour samples of the average chromaticities in each hue angle bin in a colour space. The systematic variation in gamut shapes created different <b>colour</b> <b>shifts</b> for different objects, leading to different preferences.

50|$|Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is {{a species}} of {{bacteria}} known to cause the disease porcine enzootic pneumonia, a highly contagious and chronic disease affecting pigs. As with other mollicutes, M. hyopneumoniae is small in size (400-1200 nm), has a small genome (893-920 kilo-base pairs (kb)) and lacks a cell wall. It is difficult to grow in laboratories due to its complex nutritional requirements and the high chances of contamination associated with mycoplasma culture.

50|$|A reflection-type volume {{hologram}} {{can give}} an acceptably clear reconstructed image using a white light source, as the hologram structure itself effectively filters out light of wavelengths outside a relatively narrow range. In theory, the result {{should be an}} image of approximately the same colour as the laser light {{used to make the}} hologram. In practice, with recording media that require chemical processing, there is typically a compaction of the structure due to the processing and a consequent <b>colour</b> <b>shift</b> to a shorter wavelength. Such a hologram recorded in a silver halide gelatin emulsion by red laser light will usually display a green image. Deliberate temporary alteration of the emulsion thickness before exposure, or permanent alteration after processing, has been used by artists to produce unusual colours and multicoloured effects.|$|E

50|$|Common to {{many species}} is a {{dramatic}} shift in coloration associated with maturity. For example, young male ornate angelfish, Genicanthus bellus, have broad, black bands and are indistinguishable from females; as they mature, bright orange bands develop on the flanks and back. Thought to correspond to social rank, these <b>colour</b> <b>shifts</b> are not necessarily confined to males; all marine angelfish species {{are known to be}} protogynous hermaphrodites. This means that if the dominant male of a harem is removed, a female will turn into a functional male.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: We {{investigate}} whether changes in floral colour accompany polyploid and homoploid hybridisation, important processes in angiosperm evolution. Potentially, changes in floral colour can facilitate speciation through pollinator shifts. Methods: We examined spectral reflectance of corolla tissue from 60 Nicotiana (Solanaceae) accessions (41 taxa) based on spectral shape (corresponding to pigmentation) {{as well as}} bee and hummingbird colour perception to assess patterns of floral colour evolution. We compared polyploid and homoploid hybrid spectra to those of their progenitors to evaluate whether hybridisation has resulted in floral <b>colour</b> <b>shifts.</b> Key Results: Floral colour categories in Nicotiana seem to have arisen multiple times independently during {{the evolution of the}} genus. Polyploid and homoploid hybrids can display a floral colour: 1) intermediate between progenitors, 2) like one or other progenitor, or 3) a transgressive or divergent colour not present in either progenitor. Conclusions: Floral colour evolution in Nicotiana is weakly constrained by phylogeny, but <b>colour</b> <b>shifts</b> occur and are sometimes associated with allopolyploid or homoploid speciation. Transgressive floral colour in N. tabacum has arisen by inheritance of anthocyanin pigmentation from its paternal progenitor while having a plastid phenotype like its maternal progenitor.

30|$|The visual {{assessment}} of the processed images (Figures 4 and 5 e) shows that the fusion-based method enhances the local and global details in the image with negligible saturation and over-enhancement problems. The proposed method also produces a minimum change in the global outlook. It can be noticed that histogram-based methods HE (Figures 4 and 5 c) and CLAHE (Figures 4 and 5 b) produce significant <b>colour</b> <b>shift</b> {{in many areas of}} the images. The HE method results in saturation and over-enhancement reducing the details. In the CLAHE method, the local details are better enhanced than HE; however, the image looks unnatural. The imadjust method (Figures 4 and 5 d) does not provide any significant contrast enhancement but retains the image outlook and does not result in over-enhancement, <b>colour</b> <b>shift</b> or saturation. The fused image (Figures 4 and 5 e) gives better local and global detail enhancement; it suppresses the over-enhancement and saturation problem while retaining the brightness or the outlook of the image.|$|E

50|$|Use {{of digital}} {{interconnect}} standards, such as CCIR 601 and SMPTE 292M, which operate without the non-linearities {{and other issues}} inherent to analogue broadcasting, do not introduce <b>colour</b> <b>shifts</b> or brightness changes; thus the requirement to detect and compensate for them using this reference signal has been virtually eliminated. (Compare with the obsolescence of stroboscopes as used to adjust the speed of record players).
