25|$|The Triple-A Home Run Derby is {{an annual}} home run hitting contest customarily held {{two days before}} the Triple-A All-Star Game. Six players, three from each league, compete to see who <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> most home runs.|$|E
25|$|He {{is known}} as a quick scorer, and <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball very hard which has a same batting style of former Sri Lanka legend Sanath Jayasuriya. In a first class match he scored 330 of 270 balls, which is a {{domestic}} record.|$|E
25|$|While Nadal's shots tend to land {{short of}} the baseline, the {{characteristically}} high bounces his forehands achieve tend to mitigate the advantage an opponent would normally gain from capitalizing on a short ball. Although his forehand is based on heavy topspin, he <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball deep and flat with a more orthodox follow through for clean winners.|$|E

5000|$|Canadian doubles, Is {{similar to}} {{cutthroat}} tennis, {{a method of}} playing tennis with three players. It pits two players against one player on the court at the same time. The only major rule variation between Canadian doubles and traditional doubles tennis is that the team of two players <b>can</b> only <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball within the single player's singles lines, whilst <b>the</b> single player <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> into <b>the</b> full doubles court on the two player's side. Canadian doubles {{is used as a}} training method, to work on shot-making, accuracy and teamwork. [...] This game was created by Sam Nainani in the 80's.|$|R
25|$|In cricket, {{since the}} batsmen <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball with greater {{variation}} and different objectives, the field placements {{are more important}} and varied. Modern-day coaches and captains have intricate knowledge of the strengths of opposition batsmen, so they try to plug the dominant scoring areas for each batsman. Moreover, since the bowling attack has greater variety in cricket, the field placements required for each type and line of attack also vary greatly.|$|E
25|$|The shot {{tends to}} be used only in the late stages of limited overs matches, due to the {{favourable}} field settings. The region behind the wicket {{tends to be}} more lightly patrolled by fielders at that phase of the game, so the risk-benefit status of the shot is more relatively favourable to the batsman. It is also physically dangerous because an incorrectly deflected or missed ball <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> batsman in the head.|$|E
25|$|Bolder {{even than}} Riemann, Clifford confessed his belief (1870) that matter {{is only a}} manifestation of {{curvature}} in a space-time manifold. This embryonic divination has been acclaimed as an anticipation of Einstein’s (1915–16) relativistic theory of the gravitational field. The actual theory, however, bears but slight resemblance to Clifford’s rather detailed creed. As a rule, those mathematical prophets who never descend to particulars make the top scores. Almost anyone <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> side of a barn at forty yards with a charge of buckshot.|$|E

5000|$|You <b>can</b> only <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball {{once before}} it must go up, and {{therefore}} only {{one member of}} the pair is able to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball during the return of a shot (i.e., no Volleyball style 'set-ups' can be used).|$|R
25|$|Associated with solar flares is {{a release}} of high-energy protons. These {{particles}} <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> Earth within 15 minutes to 2 hours of the solar flare. The protons spiral around and down the magnetic field lines of the Earth and penetrate into the atmosphere near the magnetic poles increasing the ionization of the D and E layers. PCA's typically last anywhere from about an hour to several days, {{with an average of}} around 24 to 36 hours. Coronal mass ejections can also release energetic protons that enhance D-region absorption in the polar regions.|$|E
25|$|Pitches {{resemble}} those in Australia with added swing (lateral) movement and comparatively lesser bounce. However, genuine fast bowlers who <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> deck hard {{and hope for}} some seam as well do the most damage, the like of which are Shaun Pollock, Allan Donald, Makhaya Ntini, Dale Steyn, Morné Morkel, André Nel, Fanie de Villiers, Vernon Philander, Lance Klusener and Jacques Kallis. Spinners gain no assistance, as in New Zealand, and have to toil hard. This is perhaps a reason why South Africa has failed to produce a quality wicket-taking spinner for all cases except in the limited overs formats with Imran Tahir.|$|E
500|$|Kinsler {{was delighted}} when Rangers manager Ron Washington {{ultimately}} committed to Kinsler being the team's leadoff hitter in 2008. [...] "I didn't {{think he was}} the prototype leadoff hitter, but the guy proved me wrong", Washington said. [...] "He'll take a walk, or get one run for us with one swing of the bat. He can bunt, he can run, and he <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ball to the other side." ...|$|E

50|$|World War II {{temporarily}} stopped this innovation until 1952. By this point, most breweries {{were using}} flat top cans instead. From the 1950s to the 1960s, all beer can were composed from {{three pieces of}} metal. Two-piece <b>cans</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> market in 1974. Throughout the years, innovative ideas and development slowly changed the beer can in{{to what it is}} today. According to Ball Corporation, beer cans weighed 83 grams in 1951, and was then reduced to 38 grams by 1974, to what it is now today at only 21 grams.|$|R
500|$|Allschools writer Björn, {{mentioned}} that the band did the album [...] "really well and mosh like crazy", despite adding that the growls [...] "suffered, grieved [...] sometimes a little desperate". Fake Train reviewer Ken Hawk said the album was maybe [...] "one of the best fusions of metallic hardcore and melodic punk-rock", continuing with how the band were able to [...] "spring back-and-forth between booming chugga mosh breakdowns, melodic guitar thrashing, and driving upbeat rock…flawlessly" [...] in an easy manner. Scene It All's Anson said the band [...] "finally succeeded in rightfully earning that title" [...] of [...] "bridg the gap between hardcore and emo". McKinnon's voice was praised as using [...] "his voice extremely well [...] He manages to give the lowest screams and yet still <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> highest notes {{when it comes to}} singing. A feat, most singers can't manage." ...|$|E
500|$|McEwen then sought {{election}} to the House in the Second District near Cincinnati, immediately west of his former district, and which contained some territory he represented in the 1980s. The election was to fill the vacancy caused by Willis D. Gradison's resignation to become a lobbyist for the insurance industry on January 31, 1993, three months after his re-election. [...] "It's important {{that we have an}} experienced person to fight for jobs for Southwest Ohio. We need to bring economic growth to our area," [...] McEwen said. [...] "It's important that we have someone who <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ground running, representing our values of economic growth and low taxes." [...] Though a congressman does not need to live in the district he represents, McEwen put his home in Hillsboro up for sale and rented a home in Bethel in Clermont County.|$|E
500|$|After {{this first}} screen, players are taken the main puzzle solving interface, which {{provides}} {{instructions for the}} current puzzle on the top screen while allowing the player to interact directly with the touch screen in order to solve the puzzle. The player has an infinite {{amount of time to}} complete each puzzle, and they have access to an in-game memo pad function to aid them in solving each puzzle. If they do not wish to solve the puzzle at the time, they <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> button labelled [...] "Quit" [...] in order to exit the interface without losing any Picarats. Additionally, all puzzles have three hints available that can be purchased with tokens called [...] "hint coins". If a player needs more help, they can also purchase a fourth [...] "super hint", a more detailed hint that costs two hint coins. However, there are a limited amount of hint coins, and the game recommends they be used wisely. [...] The player starts with ten hint coins, but more can be obtained by thorough investigation of the village.|$|E
50|$|Steel from {{cans and}} other sources is the most {{recycled}} packaging material. Around 65% of steel cans are recycled. In the United States, 63% of steel cans are recycled, compared to 52% of aluminium cans. In Europe the recycling rate in 2011 is about 74%.While much recycling of tins occurs once <b>the</b> <b>can</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> smelters other methods are also used. For instance some people use two tin cans to {{form the basis of}} a camp or survival stove, commonly fueled by rubbing alcohol or other alcohols, upon which small meals are cooked.|$|R

500|$|Concerned {{about his}} dog, Stan goes {{to look for}} him, missing {{the start of the}} {{football}} game. When Stan finds Sparky at the Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, Big Gay Al takes Stan on a boat ride through his sanctuary and gives a speech about how homosexuality {{has been around for a}} long time, which eventually makes Stan accept his dog's homosexuality. Meanwhile, Richard Stamos fails to hit the high note of the song at half time. Returning to the final moments of the game, Stan steps in as the quarterback, passing the ball to Kyle for a touchdown that beats the betting spread as time runs out. In his speech after the game, Stan tells the people of South Park about the Big Gay Animal Sanctuary and that [...] "it's okay to be gay". He leads the people to the site of the Sanctuary, but it has mysteriously disappeared; people's runaway gay pets, however, return. Before leaving, Big Gay Al thanks Stan for making everyone understand homosexuality. Although the Cows beat the spread, Richard Stamos appears to prove he <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> high note that he missed earlier, triggering the bomb and killing the Middle Park team's mascot.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} solve a puzzle, the player must input an answer on the bottom screen. Sometimes, this will involve tapping a button {{labelled}} [...] "Input Answer" [...] and writing a word or number that solves the given puzzle. Other times, they might be asked to circle an answer or tap an area on the touch screen, and then hit [...] "Submit". Still others are solved automatically once the player finds the solution by interacting with objects on the bottom screen. If the player has {{made a mistake in}} solving a puzzle, they <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> button labelled [...] "Restart" [...] to reset the puzzle. Deducted Picarats and purchased hints are not reset if a puzzle is restarted. If the player submits an incorrect answer, they will be asked to repeat the puzzle, and a varying amount of Picarats will be deducted from the maximum possible for that puzzle. If the player submits a correct answer, they are rewarded with the amount of Picarats the puzzle is worth, and the plot will progress. After completing a puzzle, it can be played again at any time from the Puzzle Index, a section in the game's interface that lists the puzzles a player has completed. Occasionally, after completing a puzzle, the player will receive small items {{that can be used in}} minigames. Fulfilling certain criteria, such as clearing all levels in a minigame, unlock additional puzzles in the Bonuses section.|$|E
500|$|Further {{discussing}} the film's visuals, Derrickson described influences as [...] "the Steve Ditko, Stan Lee comics [...] {{were all about}} these weird visuals", as well as [...] "a fair amount of surrealist art and photography and M.C. Escher". Additional inspiration for the film's visuals came from [...] "a bunch of experimental, fractal videos from YouTube" [...] that Derrickson found, and the mobile video game Monument Valley. Derrickson's [...] "ambition was to use cutting-edge visual effects {{to do things that}} are fresh and new—to not just blow things up." [...] Feige explained that one of the more difficult areas to be inventive was the action sequences, as Derrickson did not want them [...] "to simply be: someone shoots a bolt of lightning, and someone blocks a ball of lightning, so someone throws another bolt of lightning..." [...] Instead, they tried to incorporate the use of different dimensions into the action [...] "in the interest of creating a visual tapestry that is totally different in terms of an action scene we’ve seen in any other movies." [...] On the film's set pieces, Derrickson reiterated that the film's astral fight scene was based on The Oath comic, while adding that the end fight was [...] "an attempt to capture the quality of that artwork" [...] from the original comics, and the mirror dimension chase was an attempt to take Inception [...] "to the Nth degree and take it way more surreal and way farther. But I certainly owe something to that movie." [...] Specifically for the climax of the film, Derrickson wanted to play on the superhero trope of [...] "a big fight scene where they're tearing up a city, and there's a portal opening up and they have to close it", subverting it by having the villain defeated with an intelligent use of power rather than showing [...] "which CGI thing <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> other CGI thing harder".|$|E
