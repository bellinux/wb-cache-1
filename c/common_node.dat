A similar construction shows that bounded-degree planar graphs have universal graphs with O(nnbsp&lognbsp&n) edges, where the constant hidden in the O notation depends on the degree bound. Any universal graph for planar graphs (or even for trees of unbounded degree) must have Ω(nnbsp&lognbsp&n) edges, but it remains unknown whether this lower bound or the O(n3/2) upper bound is tight for universal graphs for arbitrary planar graphs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We present node-centric {{approaches}} to hybrid routing for ad hoc networks in which normal nodes are distinguished from special nodes, called netmarks, hosting popular network services or functioning as points of {{attachment to the}} Internet. With node-centric hybrid routing, netmarks force other <b>common</b> <b>nodes</b> to maintain routing information for them by advertising their routing information as in table-driven routing protocols. This reduces the network-wide flooding and the corresponding delay for route set up every time a session needs to be established between a normal node and a netmark. Routes between peer nodes are set up on-demand. A node-centric routing solution is presented based on partial link state information. In this solution, table-driven routing is maintained for netmarks and on-demand routing is supported for <b>common</b> <b>nodes.</b> Simulation results using ns 2 show that this approach performs much better than such on-demand routing protocols as DSR, AODV, and SOAR.

Often the objective of grooming is minimizing the cost of the network. The cost of line terminating equipment (LTE) (also called add/drop multiplexers or ADMs) is the most dominant component in an optical WDM network's cost. Thus grooming typically involves minimizing the usage of ADMs.|$|E

For both approaches, fully implicit coupling of the surface and subsurface flow regimes provides an integral view of the movement of water, {{as opposed to the}} traditional division of surface and subsurface regimes. Flux across the land surface is, therefore, a natural internal process allowing water to move between the surface and subsurface flow systems as governed by local flow hydrodynamics, instead of using physically artificial boundary conditions at the interface. When the subsurface connection is provided via superposition, HydroGeoSphere adds the surface flow equation terms for the 2-D surface mesh to those of the top layer of subsurface nodes. In that case, the fluid exchange flux, which contains leakance term {{does not need to be}} explicitly defined.|$|E

50|$|RBS allows nodes to {{synchronize}} their clocks to {{the resolution}} necessary for example for wireless sensor network applications. Rather than broadcasting a time stamp in a synchronization packet as in protocols such as NTP, RBS allows the nodes receiving the synchronization packets to use the packet’s time of arrival as a reference point for clock synchronization. Because most of the non-deterministic propagation time involved in transmitting a packet over a wireless channel lies between construction of the packet and the sender’s transceiver (e.g., sender’s queue delay, MAC contention delay, etc.), RBS removes most delay uncertainty involved in typical time synchronization protocols. For single-hop networks, the RBS algorithm is very simple. First, a transmitter broadcasts some number M as reference broadcasts. Each receiver that receives these broadcasts exchanges the time that each reference broadcast was received locally with its neighbors. Nodes then calculate phase shifts relative {{to each other as}} the average of the difference of the time stamps of the node’s local clocks for the M reference broadcasts.
