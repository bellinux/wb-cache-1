5|$|The initial {{announcement}} {{just said that}} there would be 5 categories of songs. The full track list was not released until July 6, 2009, with Universal Studios Florida unveiling thirty songs (6 in each <b>category)</b> <b>that</b> can be played during the ride.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{folk songs}} include ballads, lyrical songs, lullabies and children's songs, {{seasonal}} songs based around holidays such as Christmas, life-cycle songs that celebrate weddings, baptisms {{and other important}} events, dance songs, cattle calls and occupational songs, tied to professions such as fishermen, shepherds and soldiers. Ballads (canti epico-lirici) and lyric songs (canti lirico-monostrofici) are two important categories. Ballads are most common in northern Italy, while lyric songs prevail further south. Ballads are {{closely tied to the}} English form, with some British ballads existing in exact correspondence with an Italian song. Other Italian ballads are more closely based on French models. Lyric songs are a diverse <b>category</b> <b>that</b> consist of lullabies, serenades and work songs, and are frequently improvised though based on a traditional repertoire.|$|E
5|$|RAAF crews began {{training}} on the Hercules {{in the middle of}} 1958 at Sewart Air Force Base in Nashville, Tennessee. Much of the training took place on a simulator, augmented by approximately fifty hours flying time in the aircraft. To cope with the Hercules' complexities, the aircrew category of flight engineer, absent from the RAAF since World WarII, was reinstated. A new <b>category,</b> <b>that</b> of loadmaster, was also instituted; airmen performing similar duties on Dakotas had done so on an ad hoc rather than a permanent basis, without a distinct category having been formalised. A specialist crew member was needed to make weight-and-balance calculations and oversee loading and despatch for the Hercules' 20-tonne freight capacity (compared to three-and-a-half tonnes in a Dakota) and for its various cargo-delivery systems. A large hangar previously used to service seaplanes at RAAF Base Rathmines was disassembled and re-erected at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, where the C-130s would be based.|$|E
