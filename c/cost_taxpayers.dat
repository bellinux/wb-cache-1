500|$|In 1997, {{before he}} {{became a member of the}} city council, Schiff co-authored an {{amendment}} to the City of Minneapolis Charter that mandated a voter referendum on city stadium subsidies that <b>cost</b> <b>taxpayers</b> over $10 million. As of 2009, the Minnesota Vikings were moving forward on a $870 million plan to rebuild a downtown stadium on the site of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. The team also considered building a new stadium in other cities, including Anoka, Minnesota and Los Angeles, California. Though supportive of the Vikings remaining in Minneapolis in 2012, Schiff became an outspoken critic of the financing plan for the stadium when it came to a vote before the Minneapolis City Council, in part because it bypassed the charter amendment. [...] Schiff also argued that the plan's estimated cost to Minneapolis taxpayers, cited at $150 million in construction costs, failed to account for interest, maintenance costs, and upgrades over the course of the stadium's expected 30-year lifespan. In a Star Tribune editorial, Schiff quoted figures presented by the city's chief financial officer, Kevin Carpenter, which estimated a cumulative, 30-year cost that could range from $675 million to $890 million. Despite Schiff's objections, the Minneapolis City Council approved the stadium financing 7-6. Subsequently, the football team moved forward with plans to demolish the Metrodome and rebuild a new stadium on the site, and Governor Mark Dayton signed a financing plan approved by the legislature.|$|E
