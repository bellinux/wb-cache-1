5000|$|An Aso Oke Hat (pronounced [...] ), {{a type of}} soft fez, is a {{traditional}} Yoruba hat that is made of hand woven Aso Oke, <b>cotton,</b> velvet, or <b>damask.</b> In the Yoruba language, this hat is called a fila. Although these hats originated in Nigeria they are worn by many men of African descent. Typically, {{the top of the}} hat slouches to one side, and rests above the wearer's ear. It is commonly worn with the Yoruba formal attire, Agbada (equally made with Aso Oke, lace or cotton) or brocade dashiki suits. Many men wear a bowler hat with the lace dashiki suit. However, an aso oke hat or crown style kufi cap are the most common choices when wearing any other type of formal attire.|$|R
2500|$|The robe à la française or sack-back gown was looser-fitting and {{a welcome}} change for women used to wearing bodices. With flowing pleats from the {{shoulders}} was originally an undress fashion. At its most informal, this gown was unfitted both front and back and called a sacque. With a more relaxed style came a shift away from heavy fabrics, such as satin and velvet, to Indian <b>cotton,</b> silks and <b>damasks.</b> Also, these gowns were often made in lighter pastel shades that gave off a warm, graceful and childlike appearance. [...] Later, for formal wear, the front was fitted to the body {{by means of a}} tightly-laced underbodice, while the back fell in loose box pleats called [...] "Watteau pleats" [...] from their appearance in the paintings of Antoine Watteau.|$|R
5000|$|Lamb drew {{particular}} {{inspiration from}} the Book of Kells, an illuminated Gospel book {{believed to have been}} created c. 800 AD, whose illustrations embellished traditional Christian iconography with ornate, swirling motifs. [...] "I became enamored of medieval depictions of these stories," [...] she wrote. [...] "The flat, graphic quality of illuminated manuscripts [...] [...] [...] made them well suited for reinterpretation with two-dimensional textile work." [...] Rummaging through Portland’s garage sales and thrift stores, Lamb emerged with raw materials, treasures to her thinking: cast-off mid-20th century curtains, tablecloths and garments. These discarded fabrics would continue to reinforce memories of her Catholic childhood, [...] "when certain religious images conveyed to me unquestioned order of the universe - with fond amusement not unlike my feelings for the holy cards themselves." [...] Among the silks, satins, brocades and metallics she gathered were [...] "some hideous things I’d rather be shot in the foot than wear." [...] Some of her quilts were also festooned with found elements like seashells, buttons, sequins, fake pearls, old coins, bugle beads, and subway tokens. For Lamb, vintage cocktail dresses from the 1950s also exuded an [...] "air of regal elegance like that of gilded medieval renditions of sacred subjects." [...] "As a skeptical adult, I conjure up these images with a mixture of yearning and irony," [...] she said. [...] "I also find humor in the transformations (tablecloth into mantle, skirt into halo) and hope the viewer does too." [...] Using these fabrics [...] "previously worn or otherwise lived with lends a whisper of anonymous experience, a shimmer of life, to the whole...For me, the spiritual aspect comes from the lives these fabrics lived. These fabrics have soaked up experience that we’ll never know about," [...] she wrote. Whether eliciting memories of common Catholic childhoods, or an instant, startling sense of déjà vu, many viewers felt an immediate connection with the quilts and the [...] "range of emotional experience that was once played out {{in the presence of the}} reconfigured pieces of <b>damask,</b> <b>cotton,</b> satin, and corduroy," [...] castoffs hinting of unknown lives, [...] "the ordinary [...] [...] [...] infused with the numinous," [...] she said.|$|R
