5|$|Fish species {{diversity}} is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and freshwater ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific <b>constitute</b> <b>the</b> center of diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo, and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate {{species on the}} Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as Cantão State Park, can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.|$|E

5|$|In 1902, Swiss {{zoologist}} Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major {{suggested the}} inclusion of O. johnstoni in the extinct giraffid subfamily Palaeotraginae. However, the species was placed in its own subfamily Okapiinae, by Swedish palaeontologist Birger Bohlin in 1926, mainly {{due to the lack}} of a cingulum, a major feature of the palaeotragids. In 1986, Okapia was finally established as a sister genus of Giraffa on the basis of cladistic analysis. The two genera together with Palaeotragus <b>constitute</b> <b>the</b> tribe Giraffini.|$|E

According to 2011 Census of India figures, 54.73% of Kerala's residents are Hindus, 26.56% are Muslims, 18.38% are Christians, and the remaining 0.32% follow another or have no religious affiliation. Hindus <b>constitute</b> <b>the</b> majority in all districts except Malappuram, where they are outnumbered by Muslims. Kerala has the largest population of Christians in India.|$|E
5|$|Past {{species have}} also left records of their {{evolutionary}} history. Fossils, {{along with the}} comparative anatomy of present-day organisms, <b>constitute</b> <b>the</b> morphological, or anatomical, record. By comparing the anatomies of both modern and extinct species, paleontologists can infer the lineages of those species. However, this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Further, as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry.|$|E
