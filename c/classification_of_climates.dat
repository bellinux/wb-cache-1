40|$|The study {{presents}} a climatic classification based on energy exchanges {{between man and}} the surrounding atmosphere. Variables that affect man 2 ̆ 7 s heat balance are included in a scheme that produces a single value describing the insulation requirements for maintenance of thermal equilibrium in familiar terms. The approach allows for the interpretation of a computed clo value, derived from standard meteorological data, as a unitary index of the body-environment energy flux. Hourly values were computed using data from 77 meteorological stations across Canada for the months September to April for a 10 year period. Seasonal maps are presented illustrating a marked zonal character and the thermal conditions both for "day-time" and "night-time" hours. The scheme enables <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>climates</b> in quantitative terms with meaningful implications as regards man 2 ̆ 7 s behavioural response to climate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Although {{now over}} 100 years old, the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> {{originally}} formulated by Wladimir Köppen and modified by his collaborators and successors, {{is still in}} widespread use. It is widely used in teaching school and undergraduate courses on climate. It is also still in regular use by researchers {{across a range of}} disciplines as a basis for climatic regionalisation of variables and for assessing the output <b>of</b> global <b>climate</b> models. Here we have produced a new global map <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> using the Köppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly precipitation and temperature station time series. Climatic variables used in the Köppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations using a twodimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension onto a 0. 1 ◦ × 0. 1 ◦ grid for each continent. We discuss some problems in dealing with sites that are not uniquely classified into one climate type by the Köppen-Geiger system and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis. Globally the most common climate type by land area is BWh (14. 2 %, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11. 5 %, Tropical savannah).

40|$|Cultivation of Coffea arabica {{is highly}} {{sensitive}} to {{and has been}} shown to be negatively impacted by progressive climatic changes. Previous research contributed little to support forward-looking adaptation. Agro-ecological zoning is a common tool to identify homolo-gous environments and prioritize research. We demonstrate here a pragmatic approach to describe spatial changes in agro-climatic zones suitable for coffee under current and future climates. We defined agro-ecological zones suitable to produce arabica coffee by clustering geo-referenced coffee occurrence locations based on bio-climatic variables. We used ran-dom forest <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> data layers to model the spatial distribution of these agro-ecological zones. We used these zones to identify spatially explicit impact scenarios and to choose locations for the long-term evaluation of adaptation measures as climate changes. We found that in zones currently classified as hot and dry, climate change will impact arabica more than those that are better suited to it. Research in these zones should therefore focus on expanding arabica's environmental limits. Zones that currently have cli-mates better suited for arabica will migrate upwards by about 500 m in elevation. In thes...|$|R
40|$|The {{inter-comparison}} {{of different}} soil moisture (SM) products over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) reveals the inconsistency among different SM products, {{when compared to}} in situ measurement.

In this study, the in situ soil moisture networks, combined with the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> zones over the TP, were used to produce the in situ measured SM climatology at the plateau scale. The generated TP scale in situ SM climatology was then used to scale the model-simulated SM data, which was subsequently used to scale the SM satellite observations. The climatology-scaled satellite and model-simulated SM were then blended objectively, by applying the triple collocation and least squares method. The final blended SM can replicate the SM dynamics across different climatic zones, from sub-humid regions to semi-arid and arid regions over the TP. This demonstrates the need to constrain the model-simulated SM estimates with the in situ measurements before their further applications in scaling climatology of SM satellite products...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade human {{understanding}} of the potential variety and range <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change impacts has expanded. Not only is the science <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> change better, though not completely, understood, but the regional variation in physical impacts such as sea level rise, extreme weather events, soil salinization and cyclones have become the subject of investigation. The impact on human settlements has been startling, demonstrated by events such as Hurricane Katrina and Cyclone SDR and AILA in Bangladesh. But the results <b>of</b> such <b>climate</b> change induced events are {{not confined to the}} immediate or primary effects; they ripple through societies, leading to significant outcomes in terms of human suffering, financial cost and downstream economic and environmental consequences. Hundreds of millions of people, mostly from low-lying coastal zones, face forced displacement and will need to migrate in search of alternative livelihoods. In most cases the destinations of such displaced populations are the nearest urban area. On arrival refuges face emotional, social and economic stress as they seek to adjust to changed circumstances. At the same time, receiving urban areas must adapt to an influx of people and the physical and economic demands placed on the existing system. As the physical climate science has developed and policy responses have become broadly classified as either adaptation or mitigation, the network of cause and effect which results from primary impacts has been less intensively studied. Bangladesh represents a region where a complex set <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> driven outcomes is already evident as land is inundated and populations migrate in large numbers. Using the region as an example this study seeks to develop a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> related impacts which extends from the primary climate events, through secondary population displacement and migration. Tertiary social and economic effects and fourth level policy responses by urban authorities, which seek to cope with the escalating scale of the problem, are examined and the interconnections between climate change, migration and urban policy are explored.
