5|$|Although the Chester Canal was not {{a success}} as traffic was sparse, this changed once it was {{connected}} to the Ellesmere Canal. The Ellesmere company expected to carry limestone from the quarries at Llanymynech and Trevor, iron from the ironworks at Ruabon and Bersham, and coal from mines at Chirk, Ruabon and Wrexham to Chester, Liverpool and Shrewsbury. The canal to Bersham and Wrexham was not built, and that to Shrewsbury was built much later on, but trade in coal, limestone, lime and building materials developed within the network of <b>canals,</b> <b>and</b> traffic between the <b>canals</b> <b>and</b> Liverpool increased steadily, much of it passing along the former Chester Canal. Receipts for the Ellesmere Canal were £12,568 in 1807 and £15,707 just two years later.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1881, {{industrialists}} proposed altering the natural channel of the Columbia to improve navigation. Changes {{to the river}} {{over the years have}} included the construction of jetties at the river's mouth, dredging, and the construction of <b>canals</b> <b>and</b> navigation locks. Today, ocean freighters can travel upriver as far as Portland and Vancouver, and barges can reach as far inland as Lewiston, Idaho.|$|E

50|$|Dodd {{suggested}} {{and promoted}} {{plans for a}} <b>canal</b> between Croydon <b>and</b> Rotherhithe during 1799. In 1800 this developed into the Grand Surrey <b>Canal</b> <b>and</b> the Croydon <b>Canal</b> <b>and</b> his plans were authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained on 21 May 1801. This created the Company of Proprietors of the Grand Surrey <b>Canal,</b> <b>and</b> gave them powers to raise £60,000 by issuing shares, and an additional £30,000 if required.|$|R
50|$|The canals {{are roughly}} bounded by Eastern Court on the east, Court A on the south, Strongs Drive on the west, and Court E on the north. There are four east-west canals (Carroll Canal, Linnie <b>Canal,</b> Howland <b>Canal,</b> <b>and</b> Sherman <b>Canal)</b> <b>and</b> two north-south <b>canals</b> (Eastern <b>Canal</b> <b>and</b> Grand <b>Canal).</b> The beautifully lit <b>canals</b> with gondoliers <b>and</b> arched bridges drew {{widespread}} publicity and helped sell lots in the development.|$|R
5|$|During the mid-19thcentury, Utica's <b>canals</b> <b>and</b> railroads {{supported}} industries producing furniture, locomotive headlights, steam gauges, firearms, {{textiles and}} lumber.

5|$|The 19th century saw {{improvements}} to Somerset's roads {{with the introduction}} of turnpikes, and the building of <b>canals</b> <b>and</b> railways. Nineteenth-century canals included the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, Westport Canal, Glastonbury Canal and Chard Canal. The Dorset and Somerset Canal was proposed, but little of it was ever constructed and it was abandoned in 1803.|$|E
5|$|The plan to {{regenerate}} central Scotland's <b>canals</b> <b>and</b> reconnect Glasgow with Edinburgh {{was led by}} British Waterways with support and funding from seven local authorities, the Scottish Enterprise Network, the European Regional Development Fund, and the Millennium Commission. Planners decided early on to create a dramatic 21st-century landmark structure to reconnect the canals, instead of simply recreating the historic lock flight.|$|E

50|$|In 1883, {{after some}} years of negotiation, the canal {{was sold to}} a company called the Regent's <b>Canal</b> <b>and</b> City Docks Railway Company. {{at a cost of}} £1,170,585. The company altered its name to the North Metropolitan Railway <b>and</b> <b>Canal</b> Company in 1892, but no railway was ever built; instead it raised money for dock <b>and</b> <b>canal</b> {{improvement}} <b>and</b> eventually, in 1904, became the Regent's <b>Canal</b> <b>and</b> Dock Company.|$|R
50|$|The Monmouthshire Railway <b>and</b> <b>Canal</b> Company was a <b>canal</b> <b>and</b> railway {{company that}} {{operated}} a <b>canal</b> <b>and</b> {{a network of}} railways in the Western Valley and Eastern Valley of Newport, Monmouthshire.

5|$|A partial cranial endocast for RAM 14000 was reconstructed from CT scan data, {{the first}} ever for a Parasaurolophus of any ontogenetic stage. The endocast was reconstructed in two sections, one on {{the portion of the}} braincase {{articulated}} with the left half of the skull and the remainder on the disarticulated portion of the braincase. Their relative position was then approximated based on cranial landmarks and comparison with other hadrosaurids. Because of weathering, many of the smaller neural <b>canals</b> <b>and</b> foramina could not be identified for certain.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs {{are under}} stress around the world. In particular, coral mining, {{agricultural}} and urban runoff, pollution (organic and inorganic), overfishing, blast fishing, disease, and the digging of <b>canals</b> <b>and</b> access into islands and bays are localized threats to coral ecosystems. Broader threats are sea temperature rise, sea level rise and pH changes from ocean acidification, all associated with greenhouse gas emissions. In 1998, 16% of the world's reefs {{died as a}} result of increased water temperature.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, Massachusetts {{became a}} {{national}} leader in the American Industrial Revolution, with factories around cities such as Lowell and Boston producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing tools, paper, and textiles. The economy transformed from one based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one, initially making use of water-power and later the steam engine to power factories. <b>Canals</b> <b>and</b> railroads were used for transporting raw materials and finished goods. At first, the new industries drew labor from Yankees on nearby subsistence farms, and later relied upon immigrant labor from Europe and Canada.|$|E

5|$|In 1818, Jennings began {{promoting}} a large-scale plan for internal {{improvements in the}} state. Most of the projects were directed toward construction of roads, <b>canals,</b> <b>and</b> other projects to enhance the commercial appeal and economic viability of the state. During Jennings's second term the state government continued to support public improvements, with new road construction and expanded settlement into central Indiana. After Indianapolis became {{the site for the}} state's permanent capital in 1821 and new settlers arrived in the area, the Indiana General Assembly appropriated $100,000 for new road construction and improvements to some of the more important routes, but it was considerably short of the amount needed.|$|E

Actions mandated included the release of more water to supply rivers and wetlands, funding for habitat restoration work (especially for anadromous fish spawning gravels), water temperature control, water conservation, fish passage, increasing the service area of the CVP's <b>canals,</b> <b>and</b> other items.|$|E
