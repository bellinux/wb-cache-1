Despite the program being on probation for NCAA violations and prohibited from appearing in a bowl for the 2012 season, the Buckeyes overcame a rash of injuries on defense in a season reminiscent of 2002 and completed a perfect 12–0 season with a victory over Michigan on November 24, 26–21. In {{one of the most}} incredible performances in college football history, Ohio State won the first ever College Football Playoff, with its third-string quarterback, Cardale Jones, after the starter and second-string quarterback were out to injury. Jones had never started in a <b>college</b> <b>game.</b> His first 3 starts were in the B1G Championship Game, the Sugar Bowl, and the National Championship Game. He went 3-0 to win the national championship. Many credit Urban Meyer with this being the best coaching job in college football history.. The next season brought with it expectations of a repeat championship as Ohio State returned many of its starters from the previous year. Ohio State would go on to compile a 13-1 record, with a crucial loss to Michigan State keeping them out of the College Football Playoff. In 2016, in spite of having the fewest returning starters of any team in the country, Ohio State would go on to win 11 games, but ultimately losing to Penn State in the regular season and Clemson in a crushing 31-0 defeat in the College Football Playoff Semifinal.|$|E
