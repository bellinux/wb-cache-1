Eukaryotic transcription takes place in the nucleus of the cell and proceeds in three sequential stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.

This synthesis is more practical in a laboratory setting and is commonly used as a demonstration or experiment in undergraduate chemistry labs. The oxidation of copper by nitric acid is a <b>complex</b> <b>reaction</b> forming various nitrogen oxides of varying stability which depends on the concentration of the nitric acid, presence of oxygen, and other factors. The unstable species further react to form nitrogen dioxide which is then purified and condensed to form dinitrogen tetroxide.|$|E

25|$|Fatty acids {{are broken}} down to acetyl-CoA {{by means of}} beta {{oxidation}} inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondria, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, {{but also in the}} reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. It can also not be converted to pyruvate as the pyruvate dehydrogenase <b>complex</b> <b>reaction</b> is irreversible. Instead the acetyl-CoA produced by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids condenses with oxaloacetate, to enter the citric acid cycle. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO2 in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form citric acid. The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose.|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} {{chemical}} kinetics {{is an exciting}} and active field. The prevailing theories make a number of simplifying assumptions that do not always hold in actual cases. Another current problem concerns a development of efficient numerical algorithms for solving the master equations that arise {{in the description of}} <b>complex</b> <b>reactions.</b> The objective of the present work is to furnish a completely general and exact theory of reaction rates, in a form reminiscent of transition state theory, valid for all fluid phases and also to develop a computer program that can solve <b>complex</b> <b>reactions</b> by finding the concentrations of all participating substances as a function of time. To do so, the full quantum scattering theory is used for deriving the exact rate law, and then the resulting cumulative reaction probability is put into several equivalent forms that take into account all relativistic effects if applicable, including one that is strongly reminiscent of transition state theory, but includes corrections from scattering theory. Then two programs, one for solving <b>complex</b> <b>reactions,</b> the other for solving first order linear kinetic master equations to solve them, have been developed and tested for simple applications. ...|$|R
