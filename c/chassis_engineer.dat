25|$|Audi also {{introduced}} a permanently all-wheel-driven road-going car, the Audi Quattro, in 1980. Audi's <b>chassis</b> <b>engineer,</b> Jörg Bensinger, had noticed in winter tests in Scandinavia that a vehicle {{used by the}} German Army, the Volkswagen Iltis, could beat any high-performance Audi. He proposed developing a four-wheel-drive car, that would {{also be used for}} rallying to improve Audi's conservative image. The Audi Quattro system became a feature on production cars.|$|E
25|$|Gordon won {{consecutive}} {{titles in}} 1997 and 1998. In 1997, {{he won his}} first Daytona 500, becoming the youngest driver at the time to win the race. He won the second race of the season at Rockingham the following week, followed by a third win at Bristol; after a last-lap battle with Rusty Wallace. At Charlotte, Gordon won The Winston in a Jurassic Park scheme; the car was modified by Evernham with assistance from Hendrick <b>chassis</b> <b>engineer</b> Rex Stump, and as a result, it was considered illegal by other team owners. Afterwards, he won the Coca-Cola 600, and after winning the Southern 500 at Darlington, became the first driver since Bill Elliott in 1985 to win the Winston Million. While Elliott failed to win the Winston Cup in 1985, Gordon claimed his second Winston Cup championship in 1997, completing one of the most impressive single-season performances in NASCAR history. He finished the season with 10 victories (Daytona, Rockingham, Bristol, Martinsville, Charlotte, Pocono, California, Watkins Glen, Darlington, and New Hampshire). The following year, Gordon won a modern-era record 13 races at Charlotte, Sonoma, Pocono, Indianapolis, Watkins Glen, Michigan, New Hampshire, Darlington, Daytona, Rockingham and Atlanta. He clinched his third title with a 364-point lead over Mark Martin. Gordon set Cup records during the season, including four consecutive wins and 17 consecutive top-five finishes. He ended the season with seven poles, 25 top-five, and 27 top-tens.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the biggest}} surprises of the 1970 {{motorsports}} season was the announcement that Penske Racing {{had taken over the}} AMC Javelin program, thus leaving the Camaro Trans-Am program to Jim Hall. American Motors hired Roger Penske and driver Mark Donohue to seriously campaign Javelins in SCCA Trans-Am Series. This coincided with the change in the Trans-Am rulebook allowing manufacturers to de-stroke preexisting corporate engines, so AMC's [...] was used as the starting point to meet the [...] displacement rule that was still in place. The team included former Shelby <b>chassis</b> <b>engineer</b> Chuck Cantwell and a clockwork pit crew. [...] The two-car Javelin effort provided the Bud Moore Ford Boss 302 Mustangs their [...] "closest competition." [...] AMC finished in second place in the Over 2-liter class of the 1970 series.|$|E

At high mileages this is prone to wear of the axle mounting bushes which is easily fixed. It is also prone to wear in the rear axle trailing arm bearings, which then wear the trailing arm axle tubes, requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement axle assembly. The diesel and larger capacity petrol engines are canted {{as far back as}} possible in the engine bay, in an effort to put as much weight as possible behind the front axle line, also reducing the centre of gravity, while improving weight distribution and minimising understeer.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of its introduction, the G6 was {{considered}} one of the most mobile self-propelled howitzers in service.

40|$|The Formula SAE chassis {{provides}} {{a number of}} functions: it protects the driver during high speed operation, links critical components such as the engine, drivetrain, and suspension together through a rigid structure, and distributes forces through the frame to allow for predictable handling and kinematics. This document examines and analyzes the critical factors in designing and building a Formula SAE chassis from 4130 chromoly steel tubing. The paper focuses on several main design issues and criteria, {{provides a}} detailed description of the manufacturing and jigging process, and also documents verification testing of the real chassis against the CAD and FEA models. The thesis will serve three functions: first as a summary of lessons I have learned about product development from personally overseeing the fabrication of the MIT Motorsports chassis for 3 years (MY 2006 - MY 2008), second as a guide for future generations of <b>chassis</b> <b>engineers</b> in frame design and construction, and third as a specific study and verification of the theoretical methods behind the current vehicle design. by Alexander M.

50|$|The Quantum I {{was built}} in 1959, with a <b>chassis</b> {{computer}} <b>engineered</b> by Walter Kern at IBM in his spare time. It wore only the most basic bodywork at first. After initial testing and a race or two, it was replaced with moderately more complete bodywork which it still wears to this day. The Quantum II was nearly identical in every way, though built later. Both Quantums I and II were raced in the SCCA H-Modified class. They were pure prototypes and racing cars, never intended for production.|$|R
25|$|Packaging {{is cited}} as both an {{advantage}} and disadvantage of the transverse FRP leaf spring, {{as compared to}} coil springs, depending on the application. The FRP spring is typically set low in the suspension, resulting in a low center of gravity. It also allows manufactures to avoid tall spring mounts, thus resulting in a flatter load floor about the suspension. James Schefter reports that, as used on the C5 and later Corvettes, the use of OEM coilover damper springs would have forced the <b>chassis</b> <b>engineers</b> to either vertically raise the shock towers or move them inward. In the rear this would have reduced trunk space. In the front this would have interfered with engine packaging. The use of the leaf spring allowed the spring to be placed under the chassis, out of the way, while keeping {{the diameter of the}} shock-absorber assembly to that of just the damper, rather than damper and spring. However, in other applications, such as race car designs, the need to span the width of the vehicle resulted in significant design limitations. Coil and torsion springs present better packaging options for racing applications. FRP springs also have limited availability and selection as compared to coil springs. Higher cost has also been cited as a disadvantage, when comparing FRP springs to coil springs on production road cars.|$|R

Turnbull took two Marinas, one saloon and one coupé. They used the Marinas as a base to develop the Hyundai Pony. In 1975, the Pony, the first Korean car, was released, with styling by Giorgio Giugiaro of ItalDesign. It was sold in three door hatchback, four door fastback saloon, five door estate and pick-up variants, kick-starting the company's ascendancy in car manufacturing.

2500|$|The entire car is {{essentially}} handmade, {{with the car}} being completely stripped and re-built from the <b>chassis</b> up. <b>Engineers</b> reinforced and stiffened the chassis seam welding in key {{areas such as the}} door seams and door frames and added carbon fibre to the strut towers and transmission tunnel and the engine bay, completely redesigning the suspension, drivetrain, engine, gearbox and other components so as to work at maximum efficiency and reliability as is expected of a road-going vehicle. Although Nismo planned on building 20 cars, they ceased production on only 19 (including 2 prototypes). The Z-tune is often regarded as the most expensive (prices for some have been known to exceed [...] ) street legal GT-R ever built.|$|R
50|$|The {{engineers}} {{responsible for}} making the prototype had no prior experience in making cars, {{and out of the}} 16 engineers only two had a driving license. They needed information about the car manufacturing process, but had to simultaneously keep the project secret. A few visits were made to Nyköpings Automobilfabrik (later ANA), but as the extent of their work involved the simple installation of bodies on imported ladder frame <b>chassis,</b> the <b>engineers</b> were not able to gather as much information as they had hoped. Also, since all available literature only described how cars were made before the war, they realised that much of the manufacturing process would have to be learned on their own. Close to SAAB's factory a junkyard provided the engineers with both parts and inspiration. They also purchased a number of cars to study, including a DKW, a Hanomag, an Opel Kadett and a Volkswagen.|$|R
