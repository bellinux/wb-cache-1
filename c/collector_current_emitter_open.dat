5000|$|... {{the ratio}} of <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> to <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> in a bipolar {{junction}} transistor (BJT) in electronics ...|$|R
5000|$|Parameters of {{transistors}} {{depend on}} junction temperature. As junction temperature increases, leakage current due to minority charge carriers (ICBO)(collector base <b>current</b> with <b>emitter</b> <b>open)</b> increases. As ICBO increases, ICEO(collector <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> with base <b>open)</b> also increases, causing {{an increase in}} <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> IC. This produces heat at the collector junction. This process repeats, and, finally, the Q-point may shift into the saturation region. Sometimes, the excess heat produced at the junction may even burn the transistor. This is known as thermal runaway.|$|R
50|$|The way {{feedback}} {{controls the}} bias point is as follows. If Vbe is held constant and temperature increases, <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> increases. However, a larger Ie increases the emitter voltage Ve = IeRe, {{which in turn}} reduces the voltage VRb across the base resistor. A lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current, which results in less <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> because Ic = β IB. <b>Collector</b> <b>current</b> and <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> are related by Ic = α Ie with α ≈ 1, so the increase in <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> with temperature is opposed, and the operating point is kept stable.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> {{is related}} to [...] exponentially. At room temperature, an {{increase}} in [...] by approximately 60mV increases the <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> {{by a factor of}} 10. Because the base current is approximately proportional to the <b>collector</b> and <b>emitter</b> <b>currents,</b> they vary in the same way.|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the spin-dependent transport properties of GaMnAs-based three-terminal semiconductor spin hot-carrier transistor (SSHCT) structures. The emitter-base bias voltage VEB dependence of the <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> IC, <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> IE, and base current IB shows that the current transfer ratio alpha (= IC / IE) and the current gain beta (= IC / IB) are 0. 8 - 0. 95 and 1 - 10, respectively, which means that GaMnAs-based SSHCTs have current amplifiability. In addition, we observed an oscillatory behavior of the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio with the increasing bias, which {{can be explained by}} the resonant tunneling effect in the GaMnAs quantum well.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} bias and voltage gain {{dependence}} of the small signal intermodulation distortion performance of the single and double InGaP HBT. It {{was found that the}} HBT has a zero in its 3 rd order intermodulation distortion at low <b>collector</b> <b>currents</b> caused by the <b>emitter</b> resistance. The <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> at which this occurs can be approximately calculated with a simple formula. The small signal intermodulation distortion was little affected by collector voltage or voltage gain. There was very little difference between the small signal intermodulation distortion performance of the single and double HBT. Through a Volterra analysis it is demonstrated that the zero in 3 rd order intermodulation distortion can be moved to a higher <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> by reducing <b>emitter</b> resistanc...|$|R
40|$|Operation of a {{transistor}} amplifier, {{the circuit}} for which {{is shown in}} Figure 1, is illustrated in this demonstration. The amplification factor is {{the ratio of the}} <b>collector</b> to <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> to the base current. The amplification factor can be increased by increasing the collector to emitter voltage. The effects of changes in the input <b>current</b> and the <b>collector</b> to emitter voltage on the amplification are shown in the video...|$|R
40|$|Transient {{enhanced}} diffusion of boron in SiGe HBTs is studied by comparing {{measurements of the}} temperature dependence of the <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> with the predictions of 2 D process and device simulations. The <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> is chosen for modelling because it is extremely sensitive to very small amounts of out-diffusion from the SiGe base, and hence provides a rigorous test for {{the accuracy of the}} transient {{enhanced diffusion}} models. The SiGe HBT studied incorporates an ion implanted extrinsic base adjacent to the SiGe base, which allows the influence of the implantation damage on the boron diffusion to be studied. The process simulations show that point defects generated by the extrinsic base implant lead to a broadening of the basewidth {{around the perimeter of the}} emitter due to transient enhanced diffusion of boron from the SiGe base. This causes parasitic energy barriers to form, which in the worst case, extend laterally several microns from the edge of the extrinsic base. The electrical effect of the transient enhanced diffusion is a decrease in <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> as the <b>emitter</b> geometry is reduced. Transistors with different emitter geometries and undoped SiGe spacer thicknesses are studied and the collector/base reverse bias is varied to modulate the parasitic energy barrier at the collector/base junction. The trends in the measured <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> are in all cases well predicted by a simplified "plus one" transient enhanced diffusion model...|$|R
50|$|The circuit can be {{explained}} by viewing the transistor as being under the control of negative feedback. From this viewpoint, a common collector stage (Fig. 1) is an amplifier with full series negative feedback. In this configuration (Fig. 2 with β = 1), the entire output voltage VOUT is placed contrary and in series with the input voltage VIN. Thus the two voltages are subtracted according to KVL (the subtractor from the function block diagram is implemented just by the input loop) and their difference Vdiff = VIN - VOUT is applied to the base-emitter junction. The transistor continuously monitors Vdiff and adjusts its emitter voltage almost equal (less VBEO) to the input voltage by passing the according <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> through the <b>emitter</b> resistor RE. As a result, the output voltage follows the input voltage variations from VBEO up to V+; hence the name, emitter follower.|$|R

40|$|Polysilicon {{emitters}} are {{prevalent in}} today's advanced B iCMOS processes. Electrical and materials analysis {{have been used}} to demonstrate the increase in npn current gain, for polysilicon emitters, with an increasing interracial "oxide" thickness. This interfacial "oxide " thickness has been tailored by the polysilicon push temperature into an LPCVD vertical thermal reactor. The interracial "oxide " thickness has been shown to affect the npn current gain by modulat ing the base current without significantly impact ing the <b>collector</b> <b>current.</b> Polysilicon <b>emitters</b> are becoming more prevalent in to-day's advanced B ipo la r /B iCMOS integrated circuit pro-cesses.

There have been reports of difficulty in controlling this interracial layer, and various solutions have been proposed. ~' 4 In this paper we present a simple method for modi fy ing the interracial oxide thickness in a polysilicon emitter technology incorporated in a B iCMOS process.

50|$|In bipolar {{junction}} transistors, the <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> {{is the sum}} of the <b>collector</b> {{and base}} <b>currents.</b> Ie = Ic + Ib. The <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> has two components: minority carriers and majority carriers. The minority current is called the leakage current.|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} characteristics of silicon-based spin-valve transistors are reported, focusing {{on how the}} output current and magnetocurrent depend on {{the magnitude of the}} <b>emitter</b> <b>current.</b> Transistors with a different combination of Schottky barriers ~Si/Au and Si/Cu! were used. The <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> rapidly increases with <b>emitter</b> <b>current,</b> without significant loss of magnetocurrent. Spin-valve transistors with magnetocurrent around 400 % and high output current up to 40 mA are obtained...|$|R
2500|$|NPN {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of bipolar transistors, {{consisting}} of a layer of P-doped semiconductor (the [...] "base") between two N-doped layers. A small current entering the base is amplified to produce a large <b>collector</b> and <b>emitter</b> <b>current.</b> That is, when there is a positive potential difference measured from the base of an NPN transistor to its emitter (that is, when the base is high relative to the emitter), as well as a positive potential difference measured from the collector to the emitter, the transistor becomes active. In this [...] "on" [...] state, current flows from the collector to the emitter of the transistor. Most of the current is carried by electrons moving from emitter to collector as minority carriers in the P-type base region. To allow for greater current and faster operation, most bipolar transistors used today are NPN because electron mobility is higher than hole mobility.|$|R
5000|$|An {{approximate}} analysis due to Gilbert {{shows how}} the Wilson current mirror works and why its static error should be very low. Transistors Q1 and Q2 in Fig. 1 are a matched pair sharing the same emitter and base potentials and therefore have [...] and [...] This is a simple two-transistor current mirror with [...] as its input and [...] as its output. When a current [...] {{is applied to the}} input node (the connection between the base of Q3 and collector of Q1), the voltage from that node to ground begins to increase. As it exceeds the voltage required to bias the emitter-base junction of Q3, Q3 acts as an emitter follower or common collector amplifier and the base voltage of Q1 and Q2 begins to rise. As this base voltage increases, current begins to flow in the collector of Q1. All increases in voltage and current stop when the sum of the <b>collector</b> <b>current</b> of Q1 and base current of Q3 exactly balance [...] Under this condition all three transistors have nearly equal <b>collector</b> <b>currents</b> and therefore approximately equal base currents.

Devices with Cu show 1. 5 times higher output current than those with Au at comparable magnetic sensitivity.
