5|$|After {{retiring}} from the Marine Corps, Bolt, then 40 years old, began a new career in agriculture. He and his wife moved back to Sanford, Florida, where he worked for Chase & Co. He remained in that position for five years, until 1967. That year, he decided to follow his original <b>career</b> <b>aspirations</b> to be a lawyer. He enrolled in the College of Law at the University of Florida, where his son Robert was also in attendance. The two formed an American handball team during their spare time, and won several tournaments. Bolt's program had a three-year curriculum, but he completed the degree in 27 months, graduating with a Juris Doctor degree in December 1969.

40|$|<b>Career</b> <b>aspiration</b> is {{the strong}} desire or goal {{to have a}} good <b>career.</b> <b>Career</b> <b>aspiration</b> refers to simply the goals that set out to achieve in either one’s current {{profession}} or one’s desired profession. An interpersonal relationship is an association between the two or more people that may range from fleeting to enduring. This association may be based on inference, love, solidarity, regular business interactions, or some other types of social commitment. The aim of the present investigation is to study <b>career</b> <b>aspiration</b> vis-à-vis interpersonal relationship of single and in-a-relationship students. Accordingly, a group of 60 single (30 male and 30 female) and 60 in-a-relationship (30 male and 30 female) students of 18 to 22 years age were selected as sample in this investigation. A General Information Schedule, <b>Career</b> <b>Aspiration</b> Scale, FIRO-B were used as tools. Findings revealed that single and in-a-relationship students differ among themselves in terms of <b>career</b> <b>aspiration</b> and interpersonal relationship. It may be helpful for the teachers, school counselors, career counselors to implement the findings by providing interpersonal skills development training programme in schools and colleges regarding career aspira-tion among the students.

Many {{of them have}} to do with the balance parents must create between their <b>career</b> <b>aspirations</b> and their familial desires. Because the middle class has greater access to more stable occupations and the chances for occupational mobility, many middle class American families must deal with the ultimate decision between balancing their families with their jobs.

25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that gender {{stereotyping}} plays a big role in influencing women’s academic and <b>career</b> <b>aspirations</b> by reducing their interest in male-typed occupations like engineering, leadership and mathematics. In a 2002 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, a group of researchers found that gender-stereotypic television commercials can restrain women academically and professionally. Exposure to the stereotypic commercials resulted in women underperforming on a subsequent math test and avoiding math items in favor of verbal items. Furthermore, the women who viewed the stereotypic commercials expressed less interest in quantitative fields and more interest in verbal domains, both academically and professionally.|$|E

Discriminant functions analyses were utilized to determine whether ability adds incremental validity to the prediction of major and occupation choice beyond what is predicted by the self-report measures, while hierarchical regression analyses were utilized to assess the incremental validity of ability in the prediction of major satisfaction and <b>career</b> <b>aspiration</b> level. It was determined that ability does not add incremental validity to the prediction of major and occupation choice nor does it add incremental validity to the prediction of major satisfaction and <b>career</b> <b>aspiration</b> level beyond what is predicted by the self-report measures.

25|$|Middle class women oftentimes delay {{motherhood}} {{until after}} the peak of their fertility at age 29–30, a delay that has become {{more common in the}} last two decades. Motherhood is delayed because of the higher educational and <b>career</b> <b>aspirations</b> middle class women oftentimes make—the career incentives are too great to pass up. While middle class women on average have children at age 29, lower class women typically have children much earlier in their lives {{because of the lack of}} incentives to delay childbirth. According to Edin and Kefalas, lower class women do not make the same delay because they are oftentimes lacking the career and educational incentives that middle class women have.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the effectiveness of a drama therapy approach in <b>career</b> <b>aspiration.</b> The author used group comparison quantitative methods based on pre- and post-test data collected from two separate workshops. The control group (CG) received dialectical methods and the experimental group, the Drama Therapy group (DTG), experienced an action method. The overall statistical results appeared to favour the assumption that an action-oriented drama therapy approach in <b>career</b> <b>aspiration</b> was beneficial to workshop participants. Statistical findings also shed light on the value of a time-limited intensive creative process-oriented workshop. Thematically, the author compared and contrasted the workshop evaluation between the CG and the DTG. Both groups requested to spending more time on each activity. The CG found the length of the workshop to be exhausting. On the contrary, the workshop process energized the DTG. Three months later, the author conducted an email follow-up. The responding rate was 20 % from the CG vs. 70 % from the DTG. Most DTG participants reported that they either took concrete steps in their career move or developed new perspective towards their career choices. In addition, the author conducted two interviews to support the statistical results. The first one was on the effectiveness of drama therapy in a <b>career</b> <b>aspiration</b> workshop. The other was about the therapeutic value of a time-limited creative process workshop. Taken together, findings in this study demonstrate that drama therapy is a valuable asset in <b>career</b> <b>aspiration</b> work.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{explored}} whether current external stimuli-focused {{marketing strategies}} {{can be enhanced}} with greater emphasis on the external stimulus of Education and <b>career</b> <b>aspiration</b> and peer and parental encouragement and nursing student’s enrolment choice, were dissected and examined. Design/methodology/approach – 1200 students {{were invited to participate}} in the study. 798 students responded to the invitation by completing a self-administered survey. Findings – The findings indicate that i) education and <b>career</b> <b>aspiration,</b> ii) socio economic status, iii) personal ability and iv) peer and parent encouragement have significant influence in the selection of a nursing tertiary education in Singapore. Research limitations/implications – All of the data are self-reported, from a single source, and obtained from the same method (i. e. a five-point Likert scale), thereby bringing into question the effect of common method bias. However, a single-component test shows that the majority of the covariance between the constructs is not due to common method variance. Practical implications – This paper will propose external stimuli-focused marketing strategies to target these factors identified in order to enhance student’s enrolment choice of a nursing tertiary course. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the literature by being the first to examine factors that influence student’s enrolment choice of a nursing tertiary course in Singapore...|$|R
