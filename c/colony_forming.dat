25|$|To {{quantify}} {{the number of}} cells in a culture, the cells can be simply plated on a petri dish with growth medium. If the cells are efficiently distributed on the plate, it can be generally assumed that each cell will {{give rise to a}} single colony or <b>Colony</b> <b>Forming</b> Unit (CFU). The colonies can then be counted, and based on the known volume of culture that was spread on the plate, the cell concentration can be calculated.|$|E

25|$|The {{potential}} {{efficacy of}} probiotic AAD prevention {{is dependent on}} the probiotic strain(s) used and on the dosage. The Cochrane review (2015) recommends for children Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion <b>colony</b> <b>forming</b> units/day, given the modest number need to treat and the likelihood that adverse events are very rare. The same review states that probiotic use should be avoided in pediatric populations at risk for adverse events, for example severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children.|$|E

25|$|GRN163L, is a {{drug that}} targets telomerase.

25|$|To {{ensure the}} pCas9cr4 plasmid was first {{successfully}} {{admitted to the}} cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing chloramphenicol; the pCas9cr4 plasmid contained the gene cmr, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, which ensured only the successful recombinants grew. Triplicate plates of 10μL of recovered cultures as well as dilutions of 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3 were then spotted and incubated overnight at 30°C and CFU, or <b>colony</b> <b>forming</b> unit, assessments were then made to identify successful mutants using the miniaturized plating method described previously. Once the mutation of interest was screened using overnight growth on M9 minimal medium plates supplemented with glycerol, chloroacetate and SOC (super optimal broth with catabolite repression), colonies were patched onto selective plates using a toothpick and incubated at 30°C for two nights. After sufficient colony growth, cells were transfected with the pKDsg-XXX plasmid containing the aada gene, {{and as a result}} were resistant to the aminoglycosides spectinomycin and streptomycin. To ensure that the pKDsg-XXX plasmid was successfully admitted to the cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin to select for cells containing both the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids.|$|E
