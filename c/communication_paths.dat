40|$|Recently Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) {{mesh network}} {{has emerged as}} a {{promising}} wireless technology in order to enable fast, cost-effective network deployment. However, achieving these requirements is a daunting task due to the mesh subscriber station failures {{in the presence of the}} adversarial environment. In fact, mesh subscriber station failure is one of the important challenges in satisfying the requirements of the <b>communication</b> <b>path</b> in the WiMAX mesh network. To cope with the node failures during <b>communication</b> <b>path</b> bypassing the intermediate nodes, the enhancement of <b>communication</b> <b>path</b> reliability is of the utmost importance in the WiMAX mesh network. In this paper, a new technique based on multi sponsor nodes is presented to enhance the reliability of the multi hop <b>communication</b> <b>path.</b> Markov model based on the multi sponsor nodes is also applied to enhance the <b>communication</b> <b>path</b> reliability when the network face with malfunctioning nodes. Ultimately, a generic model based on the stochastic attribution of WiMAX mesh network is developed to measure the reliability of the multi hop <b>communication</b> <b>path.</b> Consequently, multi sponsor technique in WiMAX could more thoroughly improve the reliability of the <b>communication</b> <b>path</b> in the WiMAX mesh network...|$|R
