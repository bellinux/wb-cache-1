Firstly, we analyze the effects of transportation mode (including transportation costs and transportation-induced <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions),</b> initial <b>emissions</b> allowances, <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> trading price and consumer sensitivity to <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> on the optimum decisions and profits of retailers. The results demonstrate that when consumers are less sensitive to price, the optimum retail price and the optimum order quantity of products are proportional to the transportation cost and transportation-induced <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> of retailers per unit product, the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> trading price as well as consumer sensitivity to <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions.</b> However, when consumers are highly sensitive to price, the optimum order quantity of products is inversely proportional to the transportation costs and transportation-induced <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> of retailers per unit product, the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> trading price and consumer sensitivity to <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions.</b> In addition, the optimum retail price of products is inversely proportional to consumer sensitivity to <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions.</b> We also find that retailers prefer a low-carbon transportation mode when the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> trading price is high. Meanwhile, the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> trading price influences the <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> trading volume of retailers.

The green product produced by the green technology {{can be used as}} a substitute for the traditional product produced by the standard technology, but not vice versa. Three models are considered. The first model concerns with product substitution only and serves as a benchmark model for the next two models, the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> allowance model and the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> trading model. The second model extends the product substitution model by imposing an upper limit on the total <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> allowance for each firm. The third model extends the second model to cater for <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> trading. For the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> allowance model, analytical result shows that the optimal production quantity of any product depends on both its total <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> allowance quota and its unit <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> profit, and the effect of substitution improves the service level, the expected profit of the manufacturer, and the green of product mix. For the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> trading model, analytical result shows that whenever the production quantity of any product is optimal, the marginal profit of production (i. e. the additional profit obtained by producing an extra item) should be equal to the unit price of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> trading within the market.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} obtain {{empirical}} evidence regarding {{the influence of}} profitability, leverage and environmental performance {{to the extent of}} the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> disclosure. To measure the extent of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> disclosure used checklist that was developed based on the information request sheets provided by the carbon disclosure project (CDP). By utilizing purposive sampling techniques on the secondary data, the total of 64 sample studies are drawn from manufacturing companies listed on Indonesian Stock Exchange for the period of 2011 - 2014. Multiple linear regression analysis provided by SPSS 21. 0 is also employed to test the hypothesis constructed within this research. The result shows that: (1) profitability affects <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> disclosure, (2) leverage affects <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> disclosure, (3) environmental performance affects <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> disclosure, (4) profitability, leverage and environmental performance simultaneously affects <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> disclosure. Keywords: Profitability, Leverage, Environmental Performance and <b>Carbon</b> <b>Emission</b> Disclosure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{based on}} the data of <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> of county-level in Inner Mongolia {{autonomous}} region of China, using the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, we quantitatively analyze the effects of six social-economic driving factors, including Gross Domestic Product(GDP), population(Popu), economic growth rate (EconGR), urbanization(Urba), industrial structure(InduS) and road density(RoadD) on regional <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions.</b> The results were achieved as follow:(1) The spatial heterogeneity of <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> of Inner Mongolia and the social-economic factors of affecting <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> are obviously; (2) the correlation among the six factors is low. (3) GDP, InduS and Popu have significant effect on <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions,</b> and effects of EconGR, Urba and RoadD are smaller. The impacts of different factors on <b>carbon</b> <b>emissions</b> at different spatial region show spatial heterogeneity...|$|R
