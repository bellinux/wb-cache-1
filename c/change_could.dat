5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major <b>change</b> <b>could</b> only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the National Audubon Society has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have {{plummeted}} since 1967, with some species showing a decline of 80 percent. The {{study also found that}} California species were particularly affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the northern pintail, horned lark and loggerhead shrike. The decline may be due to loss of habitat to urban sprawl, especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate <b>change</b> <b>could</b> compound losses in the future.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, {{whether or}} not species evolved was a subject of intense debate, with {{prominent}} scientists arguing {{both sides of the}} issue. The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species fundamentally transformed the discussion over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary <b>change</b> <b>could</b> persist: his theory of natural selection.|$|E

In addition, present review indicates that sodium fluoride consumption caused increased number of r=esorptions and dead foetuses. Various skeletal anomalies such as wavy ribs, presence of 14 th ribs, lacking 6 th sternebrae and incompete ossification of skull occur. All these <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> be due to oxidative stress caused by fluoride consumption.

5|$|Mary Shelley {{believed}} in the Enlightenment idea that people could improve society through the responsible exercise of political power, but she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos. In practice, her works largely criticise the way 18th-century thinkers such as her parents believed such <b>change</b> <b>could</b> be brought about. The creature in Frankenstein, for example, reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless. Shelley's works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft; she lacks faith in Godwin's theory that humanity could eventually be perfected.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{warn that}} climate <b>change</b> <b>could</b> {{increase}} {{the intensity of}} typhoons as climate change projections show that the difference in temperature between the ocean – the heat source for cyclones – and the storm tops – the cold parts of cyclones – are likely to increase. Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of high-intensity storms in selected ocean basins. While the effect changing climate is having on tropical storms remains largely unresolved scientists and president of Vanuatu Baldwin Lonsdale say the devastation caused by Pam, was aggravated by climate change.|$|E
5|$|The book traces {{financial}} support for climate change denial to the fossil fuel industry, asserting these companies have attempted to influence public opinion on the matter. Washington and Cook write that politicians {{have a tendency to}} use weasel words as part of a propaganda tactic through use of spin, as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate <b>change</b> <b>could</b> be realistically addressed.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{predict that}} glaciers will {{continue}} to recede and melt or, in some areas, disappear. It is also predicted that the Cuyo region could face a potential water crisis due {{to an increase in}} water demand caused by a reduction in river streamflows. In northern Patagonia, a similar situation is projected in which there will be a negative impact on fruit and vegetable growing owing to a reduction in the river flow in the Colorado and Chubut rivers. In the north and central parts of the country, the higher temperatures and lower precipitation projected for this region will lead to higher evaporation, intensifying droughts and leading to desertification. Heat waves could become more frequent and intense, negatively impacting agricultural production while placing more demand on energy needs. Intense precipitation could become more common, increasing the likelihood of suffering from events such as flooding, since most of its population lives in urban areas near a body of water (rivers, lakes and oceans). Climate <b>change</b> <b>could</b> extend the habitats of vectors carrying tropical diseases such as malaria southwards. Though most of the coastal regions of Argentina will not suffer permanent flooding associated with sea level rise, it is predicted that storm surges will become more frequent in coastal areas, affecting locations such as Buenos Aires.|$|E

25|$|There is the {{possibility}} of a rapid change in glaciers, ice sheets, and hence sea level. Predictions of such a change are highly uncertain due to insufficient scientific understanding. Modeling of the processes associated with a rapid ice-sheet and glacier <b>change</b> <b>could</b> potentially increase future projections of sea-level rise.|$|E

25|$|Climate <b>change</b> <b>could</b> have {{significant}} impacts on water resources {{around the world}} because of the close connections between the climate and hydrological cycle. Rising temperatures will increase evaporation and lead to increases in precipitation, though there will be regional variations in rainfall. Both droughts and floods may become more frequent in different regions at different times, and dramatic changes in snowfall and snow melt are expected in mountainous areas. Higher temperatures will also affect water quality {{in ways that are}} not well understood. Possible impacts include increased eutrophication. Climate <b>change</b> <b>could</b> also mean an increase in demand for farm irrigation, garden sprinklers, and perhaps even swimming pools. There is now ample evidence that increased hydrologic variability and change in climate has and will continue have a profound impact on the water sector through the hydrologic cycle, water availability, water demand, and water allocation at the global, regional, basin, and local levels.|$|E
25|$|Droughts: Climate <b>change</b> <b>could</b> {{exacerbate}} {{water shortages}} in the arid and semi-arid valleys and reduce water availability in the highlands. Many productive and urban areas {{are located in}} the arid or semi-arid region with rudimentary water systems supplied by wells or rivers. These supply systems are vulnerable to water availability, since they lack reservations that would make water available during the dry season.|$|E
25|$|In January 2011, Clement {{spoke out}} against a ruling of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) which allowed usage-based billing for {{wholesale}} clients and smaller internet service providers. Citing concerns about how the <b>change</b> <b>could</b> adversely affect consumers, small businesses and entrepreneurs, he warned {{that if they did}} not revise the decision, the government would intervene. The CRTC initiated its own review of the ruling, and reversed its decision.|$|E

25|$|These {{goals for}} {{structural}} <b>change</b> <b>could</b> have improved {{the efficiency of}} resource allocation while doing {{a great deal to}} lessen poverty. But the goals clearly required both time and the ability to restore expansion without worsening inflation and external deficits. The government initially emphasized such macroeconomic objectives as necessary conditions for the structural changes. The first step was to stop the built-in inflationary process, but to do it without adopting orthodox measures of monetary and fiscal restraint.|$|E
50|$|The net {{neutrality}} controversy arose out of changes made to transparency requirements for broadband providers, where, it was argued, those <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> permit the providers to alter {{quality of service}} or favour or discriminate against other players.|$|R
50|$|Loy and Williams’ {{argument}} was that {{any change in}} Little League regulations had {{to come from the}} League headquarters in Williamsport, PA. And if they were to come, those <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> not be implemented until the following July.|$|R
30|$|Our {{starting}} {{hypotheses were}} that these <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> {{be explained by}} regional specialization by the distinct types of countries in different agricultural products for export and also due to the different effects regarding agricultural trade in the established RTAs.|$|R
25|$|The second {{component}} of Lamarck's {{theory of evolution}} was the adaptation of organisms to their environment. This could move organisms upward from the ladder of progress into new and distinct forms with local adaptations. It could also drive organisms into evolutionary blind alleys, where the organism became so finely adapted that no further <b>change</b> <b>could</b> occur. Lamarck argued that this adaptive force was powered by the interaction of organisms with their environment, by the use and disuse of certain characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) have {{investigated}} the potential impacts climate <b>change</b> <b>could</b> have on agriculture, and how this would affect attempts at alleviating poverty in the developing world. They argued that the effects from moderate climate change {{are likely to be}} mixed for developing countries. However, the vulnerability of the poor in developing countries to short term impacts from climate change, notably the increased frequency and severity of adverse weather events is likely to have a negative impact. This, they say, should be taken into account when defining agricultural policy.|$|E
25|$|How might {{climate change}} affect energy {{production}} and {{supply in the}} United States? The research evidence about effects is {{not as strong as}} for energy consumption, but climate <b>change</b> <b>could</b> affect energy production and supply (a) if extreme weather events become more intense, (b) where regions dependent on water supplies for hydropower and/or thermal power plant cooling face reductions in water supplies, (c) where temperature increases decrease overall thermoelectric power generation efficiencies, and (d) where changed conditions affect facility siting decisions. Most effects are likely to be modest except for possible regional effects of extreme weather events and water shortages.|$|E
