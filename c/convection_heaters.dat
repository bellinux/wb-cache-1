25|$|Water {{and steam}} based central heating systems have {{traditionally}} had overall control by wall-mounted bi-metallic strip thermostats. These sense the air temperature using the differential expansion of two metals to actuate an on/off switch. Typically the central {{system would be}} switched on when the temperature drops below the set point on the thermostat, and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of hysteresis to prevent excessive switching. Bi-metallic sensing is now being superseded by electronic sensors. A principal use of the bi-metallic thermostat today is in individual electric <b>convection</b> <b>heaters,</b> where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the set point desired by the user.

25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered <b>convection</b> <b>heaters.</b> A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|E
5000|$|A {{salamander}} heater is any of {{a variety}} of portable forced-air or <b>convection</b> <b>heaters,</b> often kerosene-fueled, used in ventilated areas for worksite comfort. Salamander heaters are most often found at construction sites.

25|$|A fan heater, {{also called}} a forced <b>convection</b> <b>heater,</b> is {{a variety of}} <b>convection</b> <b>heater</b> that {{includes}} an electric fan {{to speed up the}} airflow. They operate with considerable noise caused by the fan. They have a moderate risk of ignition hazard if they make unintended contact with furnishings. Their advantage is that they are more compact than heaters that use natural convection.|$|R
50|$|A <b>convection</b> <b>heater</b> is {{a heater}} which {{operates}} by air convection currents circulating {{through the body}} of the appliance, and across its heating element. This heats up the air, causing it to increase in volume and so become buoyant and rise. Oil heaters are an example of this kind of heating appliance. A <b>convection</b> <b>heater</b> may have an electrical heater element, a hot water coil, or a steam coil. Because of the natural ventilation, they are quieter in operation than fan heaters.|$|R

Typically, said <b>convection</b> <b>heater</b> consists of a transparent layer 1 upon which is deposited a layer of a transparent electrically conductive material 2 such as indium-tin-oxide, electrodes 3 and 3 a are formed on opposite edges of the transparent electrically conductive layer 2 and electrical wires 4 and 4 a are connected to the electrodes. The transparent electrically conductive layer 2 is sandwiched between layer 1 and another transparent layer 1 a.

50|$|The term {{convection}} heater or convector {{refers to a}} class of devices in which the source of heat is not directly exposed. As domestic safety and the supply from water heaters keeps temperatures relatively low, radiation is inefficient in comparison to convection. <b>Convection</b> <b>heaters</b> also work differently to electric radiators in that they disperse heat differently.|$|E
50|$|In <b>convection</b> <b>heaters,</b> heating {{elements}} either warm the air directly or heat oil or another filler, {{which in turn}} transfers heat to the air. The air then warms the objects {{and people in the}} space. Convective heaters are suitable for providing constant, diffuse heat in well-insulated rooms. Oil heaters warm up slowly but do not reach dangerous surface temperatures; wire-element heaters, which may be fan assisted, produce warm air more quickly but may pose a fire hazard. One particular type of convective heater is the fan heater.|$|E

40|$|The {{features}} of microclimate creation in living quarters where outside air inflow comes through ventilation valves are studied {{with respect to}} different types of heat appliances (<b>convection</b> <b>heaters</b> and radiators). The numerical simulation was used. Hydrodynamic equations solving taken with initial and boundary conditions allowed us to obtain information about temperature distribution and air speed in the studied volume.

The study results provide an estimation of temporal patterns of temperature changes and air speed in different zones of heated room with radiators and <b>convection</b> <b>heaters</b> in use.

25|$|In a <b>convection</b> <b>heater,</b> {{the heating}} element heats {{the air in}} contact with it by thermal conduction. Hot air is less dense than cool air, so it rises due to buoyancy, {{allowing}} more cool air to flow in to take its place. This sets up a convection current of hot air that rises from the heater, heats up the surrounding space, cools and then repeats the cycle. These heaters are sometimes filled with oil. They are ideally suited for heating a closed space. They operate silently and have a lower risk of ignition hazard if they make unintended contact with furnishings compared to radiant electric heaters.|$|R
40|$|A {{radiant heat}} flux gage {{calibration}} system {{exists in the}} Flight Loads Laboratory at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center. This calibration system must be well understood if the heat flux gages calibrated in it are to provide useful data during radiant heating ground tests or flight tests of high speed aerospace vehicles. A part of the calibration system characterization process {{is to develop a}} numerical model of the flat plate heater element and heat flux gage, which will help identify errors due to <b>convection,</b> <b>heater</b> element erosion, and other factors. A 2 -dimensional mathematical model of the gage-plate system has been developed to simulate the combined problem involving convection, radiation and mass loss by chemical reaction. A fourth order finite difference scheme is used to solve the steady state governing equations and determine the temperature distribution in the gage and plate, incident heat flux on the gage face, and flat plate erosion. Initial gage heat flux predictions from the model are found to be within 17 % of experimental results...|$|R
5000|$|The Model “S”, here as {{illustrated}} in 1924, {{is an example of}} an early model <b>convection</b> space <b>heater,</b> by the Sala Heater & Mantel Co. in Dallas, Texas. The Model [...] "S" [...] was considered to be highly efficient radiant type of gas heater at the time. The heater utilizes radiant heat, and, by virtue of draft construction, supplements its power by drawing cold air through the facing, heating it and forcing it into the room through the register. This not only forces the circulation that provides an even warmth in every section of the room, but enables the heater to operate at all times with a perfectly cool exterior. Positive circulation provides an even warmth throughout the room, and guarantees a clean, humid, healthful air to occupants.|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional natural {{convection}} in a horizontal channel {{with an array}} of discrete flush-mounted heaters on one of its vertical walls is numerically studied. Effects of thermal conductivities of substrate and <b>heaters</b> and <b>convection</b> on outer sides of the channel walls on heat transfer are examined. The substrate affects heat transfer in a wider range of thermal conductivities than do the heaters. At lower heater thermal conductivities a higher heat portion is transferred by direct <b>convection</b> from the <b>heaters</b> to the adjacent coolant. However, higher substrate conductivity is associated with higher heat portion transferred through the substrate. The innermost heater column is found to become the hottest heater column due to the lower coolant accessibility. The heat transfer in the channel is strongly influenced by convection on the outer sides of the channel walls. Correlations are presented for dimensionless temperature maximum and average Nusselt number...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Experimental {{investigation}} of {{solar water heater}} cum distillation system {{has been carried out}} with different modes of feed water. The modes of feed were fresh water from the main supply and hot-water from the Natural Convection – solar water heater under withdrawal and non-withdrawal conditions. The natural <b>convection</b> solar water <b>heater</b> acted as an auxiliary pre-heater for the water to be distilled in the solar – still. The experimental investigation data on the distillation system consists of the distillate output and temperatures in the still at various locations from the absorber plate up to the glass cover and it’s ambient. While, on the solar water heater, the data recorded were temperatures at the inlet and outlet of the water flowing inside the riser tubes. The experimental data were collected between 11 : 00 Hours and 14 : 00 Hours on different days after every 10 minutes. The global radiations were also recorded simultaneously. Temperature profile in the still and average temperatures of the water basin, base plate, glass –cover and the vapour have demonstrated graphically and discussed. The distillate output and efficiency of the solar still at outdoor conditions with fresh feed water and that from the solar water heater under withdrawal and non- withdrawal conditions have been investigated and their effects discussed...|$|R
40|$|This work {{represents}} an experimental basic research aimed {{to investigate the}} influence on the heat transfer rate of the ultrasounds, in free convection and in presence of liquid. In fact the ultrasonic waves induce, thanks to vibrations, turbulence on the dynamic field, and so an increase of the <b>convection</b> coefficient. The <b>heater</b> is a circular cylinder, immersed in distilled water, and warmed up by Joule effect. This study has carried on for 1 year at Energetics Department “L. Poggi”. The effect was observed since 1960 s: different authors had studied the cooling effect due to the ultrasonic waves at different heat transfer regimes, especially from a thin platinum wire to water. We have chosen to investigate the subcooled boiling regime, because this one is the best condition for the heat transfer enhancement, according to the scientific literature. We have carried out a wide experimental study, varying the different water subcooling degrees, the ultrasonic generator power, the ultrasound frequency and {{the placement of the}} heater inside the ultrasonic tank, in function of the range of the values of heat flux per unit surface needed dissipating. These values were supplied us by a possible practical application of the ultrasonic streaming: the cooling of 3 D highly integrated electronic components. These packaging systems should have to provide all future devices, such as electronics, actuators, sensors and antenna. In fact, for these systems the thermal problem is a critical challenge, because {{they do not have to}} overtake critical temperature, after that they could damage irreversibly. Moreover, the traditional cooling systems used in electronic do not seem to be useful for them. On the contrary, the results obtained with ultrasounds, allow heat transfer coefficient enhancement of about 50...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{components}} are usually assembled on {{printed circuit boards}} cooled by forced airflow. When the spacing between the boards is small, {{there is no room}} to employ a heat sink on critical components. Under these conditions, the components? thermal control may depend on the conductive path from the heater to the board in addition to the direct convective heat transfer to the airflow. The conjugate forced convection-conduction heat transfer from a two-dimensional strip heater flush mounted to a finite thickness wall of a parallel plates channel cooled by a laminar airflow was investigated numerically. A uniform heat flux was generated along the strip heater surface. Under steady state conditions, a fraction of the heat generation was transferred by direct convection to the airflow in the channel and the remaining fraction was transferred by conduction to the channel wall. The lower surface of the channel wall was adiabatic, so that the heat conducted from the heater to the plate eventually returned to the airflow. A portion of it returned upstream of the heater, preheating the airflow before it reached the heater surface. Due to this, it was convenient to treat the direct <b>convection</b> from the <b>heater</b> surface to the airflow by the adiabatic heat transfer coefficient. The flow was developed from the channel entrance, with constant properties. The conjugate problem was solved numerically within a single solution domain comprising both the airflow region and the solid wall of the channel. The results were obtained for the channel flow Reynolds number ranging from about 600 to 1900, corresponding to average airflow velocities from 0. 5 m/s to 1. 5 m/s. The effects of the solid wall to air thermal conductivities ratio were investigated in the range from 10 to 80, typical of circuit board materials. The wall thickness influence was verified from 1 mm to 5 mm. The results indicated that within these ranges, the conductive substrate wall provided a substantial enhancement of the heat transfer from the heater, accomplished by an increase of its average adiabatic surface temperature...|$|R
50|$|The four 500 MW boilers at Cottam Power Station are {{manufactured}} by John Thompson Water Tube Boilers Limited, {{in conjunction with}} Clarke Chapman & Co. Ltd. Each has an evaporation rate at M.C.R. of 1.542 tonne/hour (3,400 lb/hr). The boiler plant has been designed for short time overload operation. By by-passing two of the H.P. feed heaters and increasing the firing rate by 8% an increase of 5% electrical output can be obtained. Coal is fed from the bunker to the fuel pulverising mills by variable speed drag-link feeders. The four barrel type mills rotated at 15 rev/min (94.25 Rad/min), and are swept by hot air which carries the P.F. mixture to eight classifiers that reject any unground pieces of coal back to the mill. Eight exhausters pass the P.F. to 32 turbulent P.F. burners arranged in four rows of eight burners on the boiler front. Each P.F. burner has an integral oil burner which is used for lighting up purposes and low load operation when instability with P.F. firing would be experienced. Combustion air is fed to the burners by two forced draught fans which pass warm air ducted {{from the top of}} the boiler house through two rotary regenerative air heaters to the secondary, or combustion air registers around each burner. The air heaters are so designed that they can be by-passed on the gas and air side to facilitate optimum operating conditions. The boiler feed water which is passed through the economiser before entering the drum is circulated around the combustion chamber water wall tubes by any three of the four boiler water circulating pumps. Steam from the drum is passed to the H.P. turbine through a horizontal primary super heater bank, pendant super heater platens, and pendant final super heater bank. The super heater platens which are situated directly above the combustion chamber differ from other heaters in that the heat is imparted to the steam by radiation as well as <b>convection.</b> The other <b>heaters</b> being later in the gas duct rely mainly on convection for heat transfer. Steam temperature control is achieved by two stages of attemperation, one of which s between the primary super heater and the super heater platens and the other, which controls the final steam temperature, is immediately before the final super heater inlet. Exhaust steam from the H.P. turbine is returned to the boiler for re-heating at a constant pressure before being returned to the I.P. turbine. This achieved by a horizontal primary and a pendant final re-heater situated in the gas duct. Steam temperature control is achieved by non-contact type attemperators. The boiler is kept clean by 42 gun type soot blowers in the combustion chamber and 42 long retractable blowers which clean the pendant and convection surfaces, all operating under automatic control from the control room. The hot gasses from the combustion chamber are drawn through the super heater and re-heater banks, air heater and precipitators by induced draught fans which expel the gasses through the F.G.D. to the chimney. The fans maintain a slight vacuum within the combustion chamber in order to prevent combustion gasses leaking into the boiler house. The precipitators which are entirely of steel construction collect the dust by electrostatic means and there are no mechanical collectors.|$|R
