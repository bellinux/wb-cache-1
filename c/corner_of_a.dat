5|$|In Ukraine, a {{memorial}} complex was erected {{to honor the}} over 4300 officer victims of the Katyń massacre murdered in Pyatykhatky, 14kilometres/8.7miles north of Kharkiv in Ukraine; the complex lies in a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> former resort home for NKVD officers. Children had discovered hundreds of Polish officer buttons whilst playing on the site.|$|E
5|$|A long, straight-bladed dagger (pugio) was the gladiator's final weapon. A {{tombstone}} {{found in}} Romania shows a retiarius holding a dagger with four spikes (known as a quadrenseach spike at the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> square guard) {{instead of the}} usual bladed dagger. This was previously thought to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon but a recently excavated femur bone from a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus has wounds consistent with the use of such a weapon.|$|E
5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the {{southwest}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.|$|E
50|$|For {{chemical}} compounds with regular lattices such as sodium chloride and caesium chloride, <b>a</b> count <b>of</b> the nearest neighbors gives <b>a</b> good picture <b>of</b> {{the environment of}} the ions. In sodium chloride each sodium ion has 6 chloride ions as nearest neighbours (at 276 pm) at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> octahedron and each chloride ion has 6 sodium atoms (also at 276 pm) at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> octahedron. In caesium chloride each caesium has 8 chloride ions (at 356 pm) situated at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cube and each chloride has eight caesium ions (also at 356 pm) at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cube.|$|R
50|$|The {{coordination}} {{number of}} each atom {{in the structure}} is 8: the central cation is coordinated to 8 anions on the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cube as shown, and similarly, the central anion is coordinated to 8 cations on the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cube.|$|R

5|$|Hibiki is a {{young girl}} with little {{confidence}} in her abilities, except in tea making. When she met Shirotsuki, Hibiki was a shy girl who would hide in the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> room in his house speechlessly. Eventually, Hibiki warmed up to Shirotsuki's affectionate personality and came to consider him a very important person. Hibiki can be very lighthearted, and always helps people who need it. She has no talent for magic, and relies on her master to help her in this regard. She is a crybaby and somewhat clumsy, but does her best and wins people over with her abundant kindness and warm heart.|$|E
5|$|Michael (turned {{back into}} a zombie) and his fellow corpses then back the frightened girl into the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nearby {{abandoned}} house. Michael then reaches for his date's throat as she lets out a bloodcurdling scream, only to awake and realize {{it was all a}} dream. Michael then offers to take her home, and she happily obliges. As they walk out of the house, Michael turns around and looks at the camera, thus revealing his yellow werewolf eyes and fangs {{from the beginning of the}} video, as we hear Vincent Price's haunting laugh, while Michael grins.|$|E

5|$|The Robillon wing {{contains}} an {{entrance to the}} palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps. Their design creates an illusion of a longer and higher perspective, centred on a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> terrace because of exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight {{so as not to}} lead the eye and footstep towards an angle of the colonnade beyond. The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary (see key 11). The bays of the façade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and pilasters in natural stone (see illustration).|$|E
5|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds {{may be a}} visual manifestation of a {{low-level}} mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent to a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Knowles laying on a table, lit with a {{flashing}} bright red light. While a siren is blaring, she half-stands and sings while {{dancing on the}} table. She proceeds to an interrogation room {{similar to the one}} in the film Basic Instinct. Knowles sings the first verse in a house with a seashore backdrop. She wants to escape, and struggles with masked and uniformed guards in a hallway. She is then returned to the interrogation room. In between cuts, she sings in a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> room, is seen reflected in a mirror while screaming, and among a group of reporters. As the song closes, Knowles is shown crying. The video ends with a close-up view of Knowles putting on red lipstick. The scene shows only her lips.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} stratum, fragmentary remains of round or {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered. The potsherds {{found in this}} layer date it to Early Bronze Age. In the third stratum large elliptical buildings, {{very similar to the}} structures uncovered in the third stratum in an excavation near Kiryat Ata, were exposed. An abundance of broken storage vessels, in their original place, were found there. This pottery indicates that the building should be ascribed to an early phase of Early Bronze Age. In the second stratum, sections of minor construction and a few potsherds from diverse periods were found. The potsherds could not be attributed with any degree of certainty to the architectural remains. Early Bronze Age II, Intermediate Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age and the Roman period stand out among the periods, to which these sherds are ascribed. A tomb attributed to the Middle Bronze Age was found; it contained scant remains of human bones and a bronze spearhead with a socket. The <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building that probably dated to the Early Roman period was discovered close to the surface {{in the eastern part of}} the excavation area.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E
