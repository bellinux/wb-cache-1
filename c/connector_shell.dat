Traditionally through hole plated (THP) board style pins were used (print) but increasingly gull wing surface mount (SMD) connections are used, although the latter frequently exhibit solder pad contact problems when exposed to mechanical stress. These connectors are frequently mounted at a right angle to the PCB, allowing a cable to be plugged into the edge of the PCB assembly. While angled connectors traditionally occupied significant room on the PCB, flat SMD connector variants are produced by various manufacturers. Electrical/mechanical anchor points (often soldered) for the <b>connector</b> <b>shell</b> and locking screws are also provided, but significantly differ in their position between US and EU connector variants, so that the correct type must be used unless the PCB was designed to accept them both. The PCB connectors are available in variants with either inch or metric pitch of the soldered contacts.

40|$|Military and {{aerospace}} industries use Mil-Spec type electrical connections on bulkhead panels that require inline access for mate and demate operations. These connectors are usually in tight proximity to other connectors, or recessed within panels. The pliers described {{here have been}} designed to work in such tight spaces, and consist of a mirrored set of parallel handles, two cross links, two return springs, and replaceable polyurethane-coated end effectors. The polyurethane eliminates metal-to-metal contact and provides a high-friction surface between the jaw and the connector. Operationally, the user would slide the pliers over the <b>connector</b> <b>shell</b> until the molded polyurethane lip makes contact with the <b>connector</b> <b>shell</b> edge. Then, by squeezing the handles, the end effector jaws grip the <b>connector</b> <b>shell,</b> allowing the connector to be easily disconnected by rotating the pliers. Mating the connector occurs by reversing the prescribed procedure, except the <b>connector</b> <b>shell</b> is placed into the jaws by hand. The molded lip within the jaw allows the user to apply additional force for difficult-to-mate connectors. Handle design has been carefully examined to maximize comfort, limit weight, incorporate tether locations, and improve ergonomics. They have been designed with an off-axis offset for wiring harness clearance, while placing the connector axis of rotation close to the user s axis of wrist rotation. This was done to eliminate fatigue during multiple connector panel servicing. To limit handle opening width, with user ergonomics in mind, the pliers were designed using a parallel jaw mechanism.

40|$|A new way {{to connect}} pulsed-power modules to a common load is presented. Unlike {{previous}} <b>connectors,</b> the clam <b>shell</b> magnetically insulated transmission line (CSMITL) has magnetic nulls only at large radius where the cathode electric field is kept below the threshold for emission, has only a simply connected magnetic topology to avoid plasma motion along magnetic field lines into highly stressed gaps, and has electron injectors that ensure efficient electron flow even in the limiting case of self-limited MITLs. Multilevel magnetically insulated transmission lines with a posthole convolute are the standard solution but associated losses limit the performance of state-of-the-art accelerators.

40|$|The SA 1358 - 10 and SA 2052 - 4 {{circular}} JT Type plug connectors {{are used}} {{on a number of}} nuclear weapons and Joint Test Assembly (JTA) systems. Prototype units were evaluated for the following specific defects associated with the 95 Sn- 5 Sb (Sn-Sb, wt. %) solder joint used to attach the beryllium-copper (BeCu) spring fingers to the aluminum (Al) connector shell: (1) extended cracking within the fillet; (2) remelting of the solder joint during the follow-on, soldering step that attached the EMR adapter ring to the <b>connector</b> <b>shell</b> (and/or soldering the EMR shell to the adapter ring) that used the lower melting temperature 63 Sn- 37 Pb (Sn-Pb) alloy; and (3) spalling of the Cd (Cr) layer overplating layer from the fillet surface. Several pedigrees of connectors were evaluated, which represented older fielded units as well as those assemblies that were recently constructed at Kansas City Plant. The solder joints were evaluated that were in place on connectors made with the current soldering process as well as an alternative induction soldering process for attaching the EMR adapter ring to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely the EMR adapter ring to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely reflected the different extents to which the connector was mated to its counterpart assembly. In all cases, the spring finger solder joints on the SA 1358 - 10 connectors were remelted {{as a result of the}} subsequent EMR adapter ring attachment process. Spalling of the Cd (Cr) overplating layer was also observed for these connectors, which was a consequence of the remelting activity. On the other hand, the SA 2052 - 4 connector did not exhibit evidence of remelting of the spring finger solder joint. The Cd (Cr) layer did not show signs of spalling. These results suggested that, due to the size of the SA 1358 - 10 connector, any of the former or current soldering processes used to attach the EMR adapter ring and/or EMR shell to the <b>connector</b> <b>shell,</b> requires a level of heat energy that will always result in the remelting of the spring finger solder joint attached with either the Sn-Ag or the Sn-Sb alloy. Lastly, it was construed that the induction soldering process, which is used to attach the EMR adapter ring onto the shell, was more likely to have caused the remelting event rather than the more localized heat source of the hand soldering iron used to attach the EMR shell to the adapter ring...|$|E
40|$|The Goddard Space Flight Center's thermal vacuum {{laboratory}} {{has developed}} a high-speed automated system for testing the integrity of 37 -pin MIL-C- 5015 cylindrical electrical feedthrough connectors used on penetration plates of thermal vacuum chambers. The system consists of a desktop PC driving a data acquisition front end. The latter measures the resistance through each pin of the connector and the resistance from each pin to all other pins and the <b>connector</b> <b>shell.</b> In addition to identifying unacceptable feedthroughs, the system is also used for testing cables. In the special case of Type T thermocouples (used almost exclusively at the lab), the difference in resistance between the copper and constantan wires provides positive proof of accidentally reversed connector wiring. Data acquisition time to completely test a cable or feedthrough connector is less than thirty seconds. The system provides a hardcopy printout of the resistance readings. Connectors or cables with fewer wires are tested using simple adapter cables. Initial tests indicate that {{the performance of a}} given feedthrough connector can be predicted on the basis of measured resistance readings, reducing ongoing cost of connector replacement. The opportunity to positively certify the integrity of cables, cable connectors and feedthroughs before the start of a thermal vacuum test minimizes the likelihood of a circuit problem that would require returning the chamber to ambient conditions for repair. This system has two principal advantages for the Goddard thermal vacuum laboratory. Its only significant cost was the labor to fabricate the test cable and shorting cable [...] about 40 man-hours total. The system was built around a computer and data acquisition unit that were already on hand. The second advantage is that it very quickly tests both of the parameters that are essential...|$|E
40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} {{and accuracy of}} determining fastener flexibility with 3 D FE and representing fasteners in FE load distribution models with simple elements such as springs or beams. A detailed study of 3 D models compared to experimental data {{is followed by a}} parametric study of different shell modelling techniques. These are evaluated and compared with industry semi-empirical equations. The evaluated 3 D models were found to match the experimental values with good precision. Simulations based on these types of 3 D models may replace experimental tests. Two different modelling techniques were also evaluated for use in load distribution models. Both were verified to work very well with representing fastener installations in lap-joints using the ABAQUS/Standard solver. Further improvement of one of the models was made through a modification scale factor. Finally, the same modelling technique was verified using the NASTRAN solver. To summarize, it is concluded that: • Detailed 3 D-models with material properties defined from stress-strain curves correspond well to experiments and simulations may replace actual flexibility tests. • At mid-surface modelling of the connecting parts, beam elements with a circular cross section as a <b>connector</b> between <b>shell</b> elements is an easy and accurate modelling technique, with the only data input of bolt material and dimension. • Using connector elements is accurate only if the connecting parts are modelled in the same plane, i. e. with no offset. Secondary bending due to offset should only be accounted for once and only once throughout the analysis, and it is already included in the flexibility input...|$|R

Incorrect use of the ground connector as a neutral was not uncommon.

40|$|Catastrophic {{progressive}} {{collapse of a}} building can be triggered by a sudden loss of a load-bearing element in an abnormal loading event. There is a large inventory of reinforced concrete flat plate buildings designed in accordance with older codes. Without using shear and integrity reinforcement in slabs, these older flat plates are vulnerable to {{progressive collapse}}. The overall goal {{of this research is}} to numerically examine the resilience of older flat plate buildings against progressive collapse due to instantaneous removal of an exterior or interior column. To achieve the research goal, a macro behavioral model of slab-column frame is created and applied to a prototype flat plate building designed following the ACI 318 - 71 code. The macro model employs both <b>connector</b> and <b>shell</b> elements. The shell elements are used to mainly simulate the flexural behavior of slab and the load redistribution over floor slabs. The connector elements are adopted to simulate bending moment, shear, and torsion transferred from slab to column, and to simulate connection punching shear failure. To ensure applicability of the proposed macro model, it is validated by 24 large-scale tests conducted on isolated slab-column connections under three different types of loading conditions. Both dynamic and static analyses are conducted on the prototype building under service live loads. The nonlinear dynamic analyses indicate that, following the sudden removal of a column, punching failure will occur in the neighboring slab-column connections and the failure will immediately propagate over the slab floors, leading to a collapse of the building. The dynamic analyses also reveal that neglecting strain rate effects on materials would lead to considerably overestimated global and local deformation demands on slabs. The nonlinear static analysis approach specified in the DoD progressive collapse design guideline is found inadequate in equivalently estimating the dynamic response of a flat plate system. The energy-based nonlinear static analysis procedure is therefore examined and proved to be an effective approach. To indirectly account for strain rate effects, parameters defining dynamic strengths of materials are suggested. To further examine the likelihood of progressive collapse, nonlinear dynamic and energy-based static analyses are applied to the prototype building under three gravity load levels and with varied properties of slabs...|$|R
