The hydraulic cylinder {{consists of a}} cylinder barrel, in which a piston connected to a piston rod moves back and forth. The barrel is closed on one end by the <b>cylinder</b> <b>bottom</b> (also called the cap) and the other end by the cylinder head (also called the gland) where the piston rod {{comes out of the}} cylinder. The piston has sliding rings and seals. The piston divides the inside of the cylinder into two chambers, the bottom chamber (cap end) and the piston rod side chamber (rod end / head end).|$|E

40|$|Small scale explosions, using a detonator, of 7075 {{aluminium}} alloy cylinders, 15 - 100 mm outside diameter, {{were carried out}} to investigate the effects of heat treatment on fragmentation. This was the finest for the strongest as received alloy and coarsest for the softest overaged alloy. This effect {{was similar to that}} seen in investigations of the fragmentation of steel. Cylinders of 50 and 100 mm in diameter did not fragment but plastically deformed with maximum deformation at the <b>cylinder</b> <b>bottom.</b> Fragmentation of 33 and 42 mm diameter cylinders produced long fragments typical of the break-up of thick walled cylinders. At smaller diameters, break-up gave fragments of several shapes, finer fragments being largely associated with the smallest diameter cylinders and the highest strength alloys. Results followed those seen in large scale studies of cylinder break-up and suggest the possibility of using small scale fragmentation experiments in the investigation of the effects of composition, heat treatment and processing on natural fragmentation...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the jump}} method, the top {{cylinder}} is mounted {{to a pair}} of cantilever springs, while the <b>bottom</b> <b>cylinder</b> is brought up towards the top <b>cylinder.</b> While the <b>bottom</b> <b>cylinder</b> approaches the top, there comes a point when they will [...] "jump" [...] into contact with each other. The measurements, in this case, are based on the distance from which they jump and the spring constant. These measurements are usually between surfaces 1.25 nm and 20 nm apart.|$|R
40|$|A {{slightly}} tilted vertical cylinder on a table-top rights itself, {{coming to}} a halt after "rocking" for a while. These rocking motions may involve collisions of the <b>cylinder's</b> circular <b>bottom</b> surface with the table-top. Here we study the more likely motions that almost but do not quite involve a face-down collision of the <b>cylinder's</b> <b>bottom</b> with the table-top. For ideal cylinders that can roll without slip or slide without friction on their circular bottoms, the typical rocking motions do not involve collisions. Instead, they involve slow inverted pendulum-like motions interrupted by infinitely fast rolling or sliding motions during which the contact point with the table shifts by a finite angle in infinitesimal time. We derive simple asymptotic formulas for this "angle of turn" of the contact point for two simple cases: sliding without friction and rolling without slip. These formulas for the angle of turn depend only on {{the properties of the}} cylinder and the assumed friction law. These results explain why not-too-tall cylinders or disks never seem to rock symmetrically on diametrically opposite ends. Also, on the other hand, very tall cylinders that appear to rock back and forth on diametrically opposite points on the bottom rim are really (often) rolling and/or sliding very quickly on the rim by a little over 180 degrees...|$|R

40|$|In the past, {{testing of}} water impact {{problems}} such as breaking waves impacting on risers, lowering of subsea structures through the splash zone and free fall lifeboat performance {{has been carried out}} either by model tests or simpli&# 64257;ed methods such as empirical formulas and potential &# 64258;ow calculations. The simpli&# 64257;ed methods generally give reasonable results for simple geometries such as wedges or two-dimensional cylinders. When more complex structures are to be analyzed model tests are required, increasing the cost and time spent signi&# 64257;cantly. In addition, scale e&# 64256;ects may also alter the results. Recent advances in computer technology and computational &# 64258;uid dynamics (CFD) have made it possible to simulate many of the problems that earlier only could be studied using model tests. This allows for more tests being performed at a lower cost compared to model tests and with higher accuracy than simpli&# 64257;ed methods. In addition, the CFD simulations are normally performed in full scale, thus avoiding scale e&# 64256;ects. This thesis explores the possibility of simulating water entry problems using the CD-adapco CFD-software STAR-CCM+ with focus on circular cylinders. The reason for choosing this shape {{is that it is a}} simple geometry while still being a realistic problem, since this is the most widely used shape for structural members in the o&# 64256;shore industry. Also, for numerical methods the initial phase of impact of a cylinder is numerically di&# 64259;cult to solve, because of the almost &# 64258;at surface on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>bottom.</b> This means that a method solving water impact of cylinders correctly is believed to also being able to simulate water entry of other geometries. Two-dimensional simulations have been performed for constant velocity and free-falling cylinders. Good agreement is found between the CFD results and empirical lines by Campbell and Weynberg (1980). The results for free-falling cylinders show fairly good agreement with experimental data by Greenhow and Lin (1983), nonlinear boundary element method results by Sun (2007), and CFD simulations by Zhu (2006). Three-dimensional simulations have been performed to analyze the water impact of a cylinder with 8 degree impact angle assuming constant velocity. The results are compared to experiments performed by Campbell and Weynberg (1980) and strip theory calculations. Good agreement is found between the methods. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{hydraulic}} cylinder is an actuator of {{hydraulic lifting system}} in the heavy tipper, which also {{plays an important role}} in unloading. Aiming at the existing multistage {{hydraulic cylinder}} design method's insufficiency, the CAD/CAE technology is introduced into the domains of multistage hydraulic cylinder design. In this paper push-forwarding five-stage hydraulic cylinder is designed, and virtual assembly is established based on three-dimensional digital model using PRO/E sofeware. The multistage hydraulic cylinder's load-supporting characteristics are analyzed by ANSYS. The result of finite element analysis shows that the stress on the top front part of three down hydraulic cylinder is biggest, those on the trunnion and the <b>cylinder's</b> <b>bottom</b> are also bigger. It is also proved that the multistage hydraulic cylinder designed with CAD/CAE technology can satisfy the requirements of intensity, rigidity and supporting stability...|$|R

40|$|Steady laminar free {{convection}} in air from an isothermal horizontal cylinder {{affected by a}} superimposed parallel cylinder of different diameter, either at same temperature of the underneath cylinder or adiabatic, is studied numerically. A specifically developed computer-code based on the SIMPLE-C algorithm {{is used for the}} solution of the mass, momentum, and energy governing equations. Simulations are performed for ratios between the diameters of the upper and lower cylinders from 0 to 125, for inter-cylinder spacings from 0. 1 up to more than 20 diameters of the <b>bottom</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and for values of the Rayleigh number in the range between 10 (1) and 10 (7). It is found that (a) for cylinder-spacings smaller than a first critical distance, the heat transfer performance of the <b>bottom</b> <b>cylinder</b> degrades owing to the presence of the top cylinder, whichever is the temperature condition imposed at the top cylinder surface, and (b) the thermal-state of the upper cylinder surface starts being effective on the thermal behavior of the <b>bottom</b> <b>cylinder</b> once the cylinder-pacing is further reduced below a second critical distance. Dimensionless correlating-equations for the calculation of the heat transfer rate at the <b>bottom</b> <b>cylinder</b> surface, and of the first and second critical distances cited above, are also proposed.

In this paper, the interaction of short-crested waves with a concentric surface-piercing two-cylinder system is studied based on linear wave theory using the scaled boundary finite-element method (SBFEM), a novel semi-analytical method with the advantages of combining the finite-element method (FEM) with the boundary-element method (BEM).
