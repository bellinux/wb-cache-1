In total there are 22 municipalities, one electoral area and one treaty First Nation comprising Metro Vancouver, the regional government whose seat is in Burnaby. While each member of Metro Vancouver has its own separate local governing body, Metro Vancouver oversees <b>common</b> <b>services</b> and planning functions within the area such as providing drinking water; operating sewage and solid waste handling; maintaining regional parks; overseeing air quality, greenhouse gases and ecological health; and providing a strategy for regional growth and land use.|$|E
25|$|Most commonly, the {{location}} is determined using GPS and the transmission mechanism is SMS, GPRS, or a satellite or terrestrial radio from {{the vehicle to}} a radio receiver. A single antenna unit covering all the needed frequency bands can be employed. GSM and EVDO are the most <b>common</b> <b>services</b> applied, because of the low data rate needed for AVL, and the low cost and near-ubiquitous nature of these public networks. The low bandwidth requirements also allow for satellite technology to receive telemetry data at a moderately higher cost, but across a global coverage area and into very remote locations not covered well by terrestrial radio or public carriers.|$|E
25|$|Application layer {{protocols}} generally {{treat the}} transport layer (and lower) protocols as black boxes which provide a stable network connection across which to communicate, although the applications are usually aware of key {{qualities of the}} transport layer connection such as the end point IP addresses and port numbers. Application layer protocols are often associated with particular client-server applications, and <b>common</b> <b>services</b> have well-known port numbers reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For example, the HyperText Transfer Protocol uses server port 80 and Telnet uses server port 23. Clients connecting to a service usually use ephemeral ports, i.e., port numbers assigned only {{for the duration of}} the transaction at random or from a specific range configured in the application.|$|E

25|$|Credit unions offer many of {{the same}} {{financial}} services as banks, but often using a different terminology; <b>common</b> <b>services</b> include share accounts (savings accounts), share draft accounts (checking accounts), credit cards, share term certificates (certificates of deposit), and online banking. Normally, only a member of a credit union may deposit or borrow money. Surveys of customers at banks and credit unions have consistently shown a significantly higher customer satisfaction rate with the quality of service at credit unions. Credit unions have historically claimed to provide superior member service and to be committed to helping members improve their financial situation. In the context of financial inclusion credit unions claim to provide a broader range of loan and savings products at a much cheaper cost to their members than do most microfinance institutions.|$|E
25|$|Inter-territorial {{co-operation}} {{between the}} Kenya Colony, the Uganda Protectorate, and the Tanganyika Territory was formalised in 1948 by the EAHC. This provided a customs union, a common external tariff, currency, and postage. It also dealt with <b>common</b> <b>services</b> in transport and communications, research, and education. Following independence, these integrated activities were reconstituted and the EAHC {{was replaced by}} the EACSO, which many observers thought would lead to a political federation between the three territories. The new organisation ran into difficulties {{because of the lack of}} joint planning and fiscal policy, separate political policies, and Kenya's dominant economic position. In 1967, the EACSO was superseded by the EAC. This body aimed to strengthen the ties between the members through a common market, a common customs tariff, and a range of public services to achieve balanced economic growth within the region.|$|E

[...] Section 110(1) states that the proceeds of all 'takes' collected in St. Kitts and Nevis under any law are to be shared between {{the federal government and the}} Nevis Island Administration based on population. The share going to the NIA, however, is subject to deductions (s. 110(2)), such as the cost of <b>common</b> <b>services</b> and debt charges, as determined by the Governor-General (s.110(3)) on the advice of the Prime Minister who can also take advice from the Premier of Nevis (s.110(4))." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} <b>common</b> <b>services</b> that the cunning folk {{provided}} was in combating the effects of malevolent witchcraft and the curses which these witches had allegedly placed upon people. Alongside this, they were also known at times for identifying witches, and in this manner they were [...] "the only healers to offer a comprehensive package of anti-witch measures." [...] British cunning folk were known to {{use a variety of}} methods in order to cure someone of malevolent sorcery, including tackling the witch either physically or through the law courts, breaking the spell over the individual by magical means, and by using charms and potions to remove the witchcraft from the afflicted person's body. As historian Owen Davies noted, [...] "Most cunning-folk employed a multi-pronged approach to curing witchcraft, using a combination of written charms, magic rituals, prayers and herbal medicines, thereby appealing to the physical, psychological and spiritual needs of the sick." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{operating}} system (OS) is software (programs and data) {{that runs on}} computers and manages the computer hardware and provides <b>common</b> <b>services</b> for efficient execution of various application software. For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the {{operating system}} acts as an intermediary between application programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware, but will frequently call the OS or be interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on almost any device that contains a computer—from cellular phones and video game consoles to supercomputers and web servers. The GM-NAA I/O, created by Owen Mock and Bob Patrick of General Motors Research Laboratories in early 1956 (or late 1955) for their IBM 701 mainframe computer is {{generally considered to be}} the first [...] "batch processing" [...] operating system and possibly the first [...] "real" [...] operating system. Rudimentary forms of operating systems existed before batch processing, the Input/Output Control System (IOCS) being one example. However, what specifically differentiated and made the GM-NAA I/O as {{the first of its kind}} was that instead of having a human operator manually load each program as what previous systems were only capable of doing, computerized software as used on GM-NAA I/O, thereafter handled the scheduling, management, and multi-tasking of all computer applications.|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, a more {{substantial}} revision was made. There were now two rites {{for the most}} <b>common</b> <b>services,</b> the first that kept most {{of the language of}} 1928, and the second using only contemporary language (some of it newly composed, and some adapted from the older language). Many changes were made in the rubrics and the shapes of the services, which were generally made for both the traditional and contemporary language versions. However, there was arguably a greater degree of continuity than was the case in England, which may account for the fact that all the books of the series, from 1790 to 1979 retain the same title. The 1979 book owes a good deal to the Liturgical Movement and to the 19th-century Catholic revival. Many traditionalists, both Anglo-Catholics and Evangelicals, felt alienated by the theological changes made in the 1979 BCP, and in 1991 The Church of the Good Shepherd in Rosemont, PA published a book entitled, the Anglican Service Book which is [...] "a traditional language adaptation of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer together with the Psalter or Psalms of David and Additional Devotions." [...] Books like this are allowed in the Episcopal Church because of a rubric in the 1979 Prayer Book which allows for the translation of the contemporary language into the traditional language of the 1928 Book of Common Prayer.|$|E
