40|$|The paper investigates {{cyclical}} {{fluctuations in the}} <b>current</b> and financial (formerly capital) accounts of the balance of payments and major underlying components for nine industrial countries. The empirical model uses as explanatory variables domestic output growth, price inflation, real exchange rate fluctuations, energy price inflation, global growth, and regional growth. The evidence from the estimation of the model indicates the importance of fluctuations in output growth to the cyclicality of the <b>current</b> and financial account balances. The necessary and sufficient condition to sustain a large <b>current</b> account deficit is high domestic growth, which tends to stimulate financial inflows and provides adequate resources for financing. Other factors appear to be less important to the cyclicality of the <b>current</b> and financial account balances and their negative correlations.
