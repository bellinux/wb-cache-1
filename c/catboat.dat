Bamforth laid the keel while in San Francisco, bought copper rivets for the hull planking in Portland, Oregon, and began painting the boat after Pennsylvanian had traversed the Panama Canal.

50|$|Descended {{from small}} boats carried by 18th century British {{merchant}} {{ships in the}} new world, {{around the turn of}} the 20th century, <b>catboats</b> were adapted for racing, and long booms and gaffs, bowsprits and large jibs were fitted to capture as much wind as possible. The decline of racing and advent of small, efficient gasoline engines eliminated the need for large sailplans, and <b>catboats</b> today are used as pleasure craft for day sailing and cruising, and have the virtues of roominess, stability and simple handling, though many <b>catboats</b> have poorer upwind performance than well-designed sloop-rigged craft.|$|R

50|$|The modern lateen {{is often}} used as a simple rig for <b>catboats</b> and other small {{recreational}} sailing craft.

40|$|This article {{covers the}} biology {{and the history}} of the bay scallop {{habitats}} and fishery from Massachusetts to North Carolina. The scallop species that ranges from Massachusetts to New York is Argopecten irradians irradians. In New Jersey, this species grades into A. i. concentricus, which then ranges from Maryland though North Carolina. Bay scallops inhabit broad, shallow bays usually containing eelgrass meadows, an important component in their habitat. Eelgrass appears to be a factor in the production of scallop larvae and also the protection of juveniles, especially, from predation. Bay scallops spawn during the warm months and live for 18 – 30 months. Only two generations of scallops are present at any time. The abundances of each vary widely among bays and years. Scallops were harvested along with other mollusks on a small scale by Native Americans. During most of the 1800 ’s, people of European descent gathered them at wading depths or from beaches where storms had washed them ashore. Scallop shells were also and continue to be commonly used in ornaments. Some fishing for bay scallops began in the 1850 ’s and 1860 ’s, when the A-frame dredge became available and markets were being developed for the large, white, tasty scallop adductor muscles, and by the 1870 ’s commercial-scale fishing was underway. This has always been a cold-season fishery: scallops achieve full size by late fall, and the eyes or hearts (adductor muscles) remain preserved in the cold weather while enroute by trains and trucks to city markets. The first boats used were sailing <b>catboats</b> and sloops in New England and New York. To a lesser extent, scallops probably were also harvested by using push nets, picking them up with scoop nets, and anchor-roading. In the 1910 ’s and 1920 ’s, the sails on <b>catboats</b> were replaced with gasoline engines. By the mid 1940 ’s, outboard motors became more available and with them the numbers of fishermen increased. The increases consisted of parttimers who took leaves of 2 – 4 weeks from their regular jobs to earn extra money. In the years when scallops were abundant on local beds, the fishery employed as many as 10 – 50...|$|R
60|$|I had {{not heard}} a silence before in years. It was absolute. I raised myself on my elbow and listened to it. Sleep!

5000|$|An {{unstayed}} mast (also {{known as}} a freestanding mast) {{is a type of}} mast on a boat that is not supported by any stays. Unstayed masts are often seen with smaller sailing dinghies such as the Optimist, Topper and the Laser, but can also be used on larger vessels. Traditional American <b>catboats</b> and Dutch fishing vessels ranging up to 60 feet have been built with unstayed wooden masts and recently schooners in the 70 foot range have been built with unstayed carbon fibre masts. Freedom Yachts produced a large number of yachts up to 44 feet with unstayed masts. Unstayed masts may provide better aerodynamics but require careful design both as far as the mast itself is concerned {{and as far as the}} vessel deck and keel design is concerned. Unstayed masts themselves are often somewhat heavier, which raises the vessel center of gravity. The deck and hull that support the mast need to be specially designed for the installation of an unstayed mast. Remarkably, unstayed masts do reduce hull loads since the standing rigging does not induce compressive loads into the mast and tensile loads in the hull sides in way of the chainplates.|$|R
5000|$|The {{boat was}} {{designed}} in 1913−14 {{in the village}} of Osterville, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, for a group of sailors from the Wianno Yacht Club. They requested Horace Manley Crosby to design a sailboat for racing on Nantucket Sound. Manley Crosby {{was a member of the}} Crosby family, noted for building the famous Crosby <b>catboats.</b> Fourteen boats were delivered and raced that summer. Those fourteen boats were No. 1 Dione, No. 2 Wendy, No. 3 Telemark, No. 4 A.P.H., No. 5 Commy, No. 6 Snookums, No. 7 Bob White, No. 8 Sea Dog, No. 9 Marie, No. 10 Qui Vive, No. 11 Fantasy, No. 12 Whistle Wing, No. 13 Maxixe, and No. 14 Ethyl. All but two of these original boats have been lost. No. 7 now known as Tirza is in Osterville MA and No. 11 Fantasy is in the collections of Mystic Seaport Museum in Mystic, CT. All the other original boats have been lost due to deterioration, fires, or hurricanes. See the book, The Senior, privately published in 1989 for the boat's 75th anniversary, for more information of the history of the class. That history was adapted from the article [...] "Warriors of Wianno". The book also contains several articles and photos by Wianno Senior owners and sailors.|$|R
