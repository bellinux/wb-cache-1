40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: University {{students}} face multiple stressors such {{as academic}} overload, constant pressure to succeed, competition with peers {{as well as}} concerns about the future. Stress {{should not be considered}} on its own, but should be associated with potential risk behaviors leading to onset of substance use and related problems heightened during the university period. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of main substance use and behavioral addictions among students in higher education in France and to examine the relationship with perceived stress. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was filled out by university student volunteers from Upper Normandy (France) either by anonymous online questionnaire or by paper questionnaire. Data collected included socio-economic characteristics, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis) and hazardous behaviors: alcohol abuse problems, smoking, consumption of cannabis, eating disorders, and cyber addiction. RESULTS: A total of 1876 students were included. Mean PSS score was 15. 9 (standard deviation[*]=[*] 7. 2). Highly stressed students (4 th quartile) were compared with lesser stressed students (1 st quartile). A positive relation was observed between female gender, regular smokers, alcohol abuse problems, risk of <b>cyberaddiction</b> and especially eating disorders (AOR[*]=[*] 5. 45, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 3. 42 - 8. 69), and increasing PSS score. PSS score however, was not significantly related to the curriculum, regular alcohol use, drunkenness or binge drinking even after additional controlling for use of other substances. We found a significant negative association between stress and practice of sport: students with the most physical activity were less likely to report perceived stress (4 th quartile: AOR[*]=[*] 0. 57, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 39 - 0. 80). CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study among university students in France revealed that perceived stress was associated not only with known risks such as alcohol misuse, but also with new risks such as eating disorders and cyber addiction. These results could help to develop preventive interventions focussing on these risk behaviors and subsequently improving stress coping capacity in this high-risk population...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Studies {{conducted}} on characteristics of binge drinking and associated behaviours in college student populations are scarce especially in France. Hence, {{it is important}} to identify risk factors for binge drinking at university, especially those which may be changed. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the prevalence of binge drinking and associated behaviours across a large sample of college students in Upper Normandy (France). Methods A cross sectional study was performed between November 2009 and February 2013 and data on socioeconomic characteristics and behavioural risk factors were collected: alcohol (consumption and misuse of alcohol, occasional and frequent binge drinking), tobacco, cannabis, <b>cyberaddiction,</b> stress and depression. An anonymous self-administered questionnaire was filled out by college student volunteers from Upper Normandy (France) either online or by paper questionnaire. Analyses were performed using multivariate logistic regression models. Results A total of 3286 students were included. The mean (Standard Deviation (SD)) age of students was 20. 8  years (SD[*]=[*] 2. 1) with a male–female ratio of 0. 60. The prevalence of binge drinking in the never, occasional and frequent categories was respectively 34. 9  %, 51. 3  %, and 13. 8  %. The mean number of units of alcohol consumed per week (except BD episodes) was 0. 78 for never, 3. 7 for occasional and 10. 5 for frequent binge drinkers (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). A positive relation was observed between frequent binge drinking and the following: male gender (AOR 4. 77 95  % CI (3. 43 – 6. 63); p[*]<[*] 0. 0001), living in rented accommodation AOR 1. 70 95  % CI (1. 21 - 2. 40; p[*]<[*] 0. 0001), attending business school AOR 4. 72 95  % CI (2. 76 – 8. 08; p[*]<[*] 0. 0001), regular practice of sport AOR 1. 70 95  % CI (1. 24 – 2. 34; p[*]=[*] 0. 001), smoking AOR 5. 89 95  % CI (4. 03 – 8. 60; p[*]<[*] 0. 0001), occasional cannabis use AOR 12. 66 95  % CI (8. 97 – 17. 87;p[*]<[*] 0. 0001), and alcohol abuse AOR 19. 25 95  % CI (13. 4 – 27. 72; p[*]<[*]. 0001). A negative association was observed between frequent binge drinking and grant holder status, living in couples, and stress. Conclusions This study highlights the spread of binge drinking among college students and identifies student populations at risk: male gender, living in rented accommodation, regular practice of sport, and other risk behaviours such as use of tobacco, cannabis and alcohol. These behaviours increase with the frequency of binge drinking...|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades, Internet {{addiction}} (IA) {{has been the most}} commonly used term in research into online activities and their influence on the development of behavioral addictions. The aim of this review is {{to assess the impact of}} the concept of Internet gaming disorder (IGD), proposed by the American Psychiatric Association, on the scientific literature regarding IA. It presents a bibliometric analysis of the IA literature starting from the time IGD was first proposed, with the objective of observing and comparing the topics that have arisen during this period among the different IA themes researched. The findings demonstrate a steady evolution, particularly regarding publications related to the general aspects of IA: its clinical component, its prevalence and psychometric measures, the growing interest in the contextual factors promoting this addictive behavior, scientific progress in its conceptualization based on existing theoretical models, and neuropsychological studies. Nevertheless, many of the studies (22 %) focus on specific IA behaviors and show heterogeneity among the <b>cyberaddictions,</b> with online gaming (related to IGD) most common, followed by cybersex and social networking. Although research on the general concept of IA continues, investigators have begun to pay attention to the diverse spectrum of specific <b>cyberaddictions</b> and their psychological components...|$|R
