50|$|<b>Calade</b> is a French {{term for}} an harmonious, {{decorative}} and useful arrangement of medium-sized pebbles, {{fixed to the}} ground.|$|E
50|$|Near the <b>Calade</b> {{passage of}} Malpas between Authon and Saint-Geniez {{there is an}} {{engraved}} stone, dated 1849, depicting a devil or demon, smiling and with feline features like the Matagot des Hautes-Alpes.|$|E

50|$|Planted with cypress trees, a walkway {{leads to}} the {{hexagonal}} entrance hall, an atrium designed by Christian Dior himself, where the Provençal <b>calade</b> floor has a pattern of compass rose dear to his childhood in Normandy. The south facade is asymmetrical {{and is in the}} 1940-50's Provençal style. The chateau is reflected in the 45 meters long ornamental water mirror, also designed by Christian Dior, showing a contrast between the sinuosity of the landscape and the rigor of its straight lines.|$|E
50|$|Anne Clérissy (1664-1710), {{daughter}} of Antoine Clérissy, married Etienne Héraud. She bequeathed a pottery near the Porte d'Aix {{to his daughter}} Madeleine Heraud (1685-1749), who was married to Louis Leroy, on condition that she used Joseph Fauchier {{to continue with the}} operation. In 1727 the factory was expropriated during the opening of the Rue d'Aix and the creation of the Place Pentagon, now the Place Marceau. A new pottery was established at the rue de la <b>Calade.</b> At first it was headed by Madeleine Héraud, then by her son Louis Leroy (1704-1778) named after his father. On the death of his mother in 1749, Louis Leroy created a new factory near the Porte Paradis. His son Antoine Leroy took over in 1780 but died only two years after his father.|$|E
50|$|In his Provence retreat Latour {{thought of}} nothing but painting, though that did not keep him from cordially {{welcoming}} occasional visitors such as painter Mario Prassinos, actors Gérard Philippe and Nicolas Bataille, poet Henri Pichette and André Allix, the Rector of the University of Lyon. Upon the insistence of his friends he also {{agreed to participate in}} a few group exhibitions and in the newly created Salon de Mai. In 1953, he exceptionally agreed to lend his works to the Parisian Galerie Carmine for a personal exhibit {{that turned out to be}} quite a success. However, Latour only started to feel the pressing need to make his painting better known after 1962 when he started to become alarmed by his developing heart condition. He then showed his work at the Galerie La <b>Calade,</b> in Avignon, the Galerie Garibaldi in Marseille, as well as at the Salon d’Automne in Paris. In all cases the reviews were unanimously eulogistic.|$|E
5000|$|Groupe sportif Consolat (sometimes {{referred}} to as Marseille Consolat) is a French amateur football club founded in 1964 and based in the Bouches-du-Rhone department of Marseille. The club is named after Consolat, a neighborhood located in La <b>Calade,</b> in the 15th arrondissement, north of Marseille. Founded in 1964 by the residents of Consolat, the club has been run by current club president Jean-Luc Mingallon since 1983. Mingallon pushed the team to success {{which has led to}} their promotion from the Division d’Honneur in 1999. In 2006, the club reached the national amateur level of football with its promotion to CFA2. This promotion sparked new derbies with the reserve team of Olympique de Marseille and US Endoume. The desire to become “the second club of Marseille” was one step closer with the promotion to the CFA in 2011. Consolat won the CFA title in 2014, earning promotion to the Championnat National, the third tier of French football. They nearly were promoted to Ligue 2 during the 2015-2016 season, falling short only by a single point behind Amiens SC. They again missed out on possible promotion in the following season, finishing behind division rivals Paris FC due only to goal differential.|$|E
50|$|At least that’s how {{it looks}} in Cornwell’s fictionalization of the {{events leading up to}} the Battle of Poitiers, {{beginning}} at the moment that a Black Friar breaks into a 150-year-old coffin and steals off with la Malice, the sword he finds inside. Scant hours behind Fra Ferdinand is an enforcer of the Avignon pope calling himself Father <b>Calade</b> and armed with a hooded hawk who serves as his own enforcer. The large-scale opposition between the English and French forces as they skirmish over ransom for hostages and salaries for mercenaries is complicated by the number of key characters who change sides. Sir Thomas Hookton, who begins by serving the Count of Labrouillade, soon breaks with him over (what else?) the money due him for restoring the faithless countess to his hearth and home. Brother Michael, a Cistercian who’s come to Montpellier to study medicine, takes up with Thomas. So does Sir Robert Douglas, who’s already fought against the English under his Scottish uncle. Few of these characters have any inkling that a pivotal battle in the endless war for France looms ahead. Neither, for that matter, will unwary readers. For, although every intrigue springs to life under the close-up focus veteran Cornwell (Death of Kings, 2012, etc.) has long since mastered, the strands aren’t always closely knitted together: Heroes and subplots blossom and fade with no consistent sense of their connections, and readers approaching the tale without the appropriate historical background will have to survive a long probationary period before they realize where this is all heading.|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} cloister of the Caunes-Minervois abbey {{is a very}} sober work realised by {{the monks}} of the Congregation of St Maur {{at the end of}} the XVIIth century. The special nature of the site lies in the presence of remains of the medieval cloister, indicated by a paved stratum under the level of the Maurist cloister (- 2, 40 m approximately). Prior to alteration works, the excavations carried out in 20004 aimed at studying the remains of the medieval cloister. This operation brought to light a large part of the medieval north gallery and a consequent portion of the east one. Together with previous soundings, these include almost every part of the medieval cloister in the area of the existing cloister. However, certain questions still remain unanswered. We are unable to locate the medieval south gallery. At the very most, we can propose to place it under a modern béal crossing the convent according to a globally east-west axis. The discovery of a Romanesque semicircular arch in the alignment of the south arm of the transept seems to us a decisive element for the understanding of the building. This access associated with a fist threshold situated under the <b>caladé</b> level of circulation seems to indicate that an older (Romanesque) pavement may have been in use before the construction of the herringbone pavement. As a consequence, the age of the partly destroyed medieval small stone wall observed in the north gallery would be proved. As regards the relative chronology of the site, the evidences brought to light allow us to advance that the herringbone pavement (<b>calade)</b> belongs to the Gothic phase of reconstruction of the church nave.
