5|$|In {{addition}} to the explanation by the women {{that they had been}} caught up in what is now called a time slip and had observed ghosts from the past, a non-supernatural explanation of the events was proposed by Philippe Jullian in his 1965 biography of the aristocratic decadent French poet Robert de Montesquiou. At the time of Moberly and Jourdain's excursion to Versailles, Montesquiou lived nearby and reportedly gave parties in the grounds where his friends dressed in period costume and performed tableaux vivants as part of the party entertainments. Moberly and Jourdain may have inadvertently gatecrashed a gay fancy dress party. The Marie-Antoinette figure could have been a society lady or a cross-dresser, the pockmarked man Montesquiou himself. It was suggested that a gathering of the French decadent avant-garde of the time <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> sinister impression on the two middle-class Edwardian spinsters who would have been little used to such company.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{while serving}} at the FCO, Penfold volunteered {{to learn a}} {{difficult}} language {{in the hope of}} advancing his career. After passing an aptitude test, he was assigned a professional language tutor and began learning Amharic—the official language of Ethiopia—and after six weeks of tuition, was sent to Gondar to continue learning the language by living in Ethiopia. Shortly after, he was posted to Addis Ababa as second secretary, because the British ambassador to Ethiopia, Sir Willie Morris, was keen to have an Amharic-speaking second secretary. Penfold was responsible for monitoring and reporting on internal Ethiopian affairs and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), as the latter was based in Addis. As part of the role, Penfold was required to attend and report on meetings of the OAU, which took place all over Africa. On the instruction of Foreign Secretary David Owen, Penfold met with the leaders of the independence movement in Southern Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) at an OAU conference in Gabon in 1977. There he met separately with Bishop Muzorewa, Joshua Nkomo, and Robert Mugabe. Penfold believed Mugabe to be difficult to work with, but later stated that it should have been obvious that Mugabe would come to power in Zimbabwe and that the British government <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> greater effort to work with him.|$|E

25|$|Further, Justice Chan, {{relying on}} the English case of Khera v. Secretary of State for the Home Department; Khawaja v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ("Khawaja", 1983), took the view that in cases of this nature, the court's role was {{not to look at}} whether the {{decision-maker}} <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> reasonable decision, but to decide whether the decision made could have been justified by the evidence present.|$|E
25|$|Australia won {{the first}} Test played at Bangalore comprehensively. The Indian batting order {{collapsed}} twice and they didn't look at any point that they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> match out of it. Michael Clarke, playing his first ever Test match, scored 151 runs to take Australia to a commanding position. Harbhajan Singh took another 10 wicket haul (5–146 and 6–78) in the match. Anil Kumble took his 400th wicket. Clarke was awarded Man Of The Match.|$|E

His teammate Jackie McGlew claimed Pollock <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> outstanding bowler—"He bowled right {{over the top and}} really made the ball 'fizz'"—but he bowled mainly for enjoyment and with a light heart. In total, he took 4 Test wickets and 43 in first-class cricket. He was also a naturally gifted fielder.|$|R

25|$|In September 2007, the {{rotation}} system came under review, {{and a new}} system was proposed which renders ineligible for bidding only the last two World Cup host confederations. This proposal was adopted on 29 October 2007, in Zurich, Switzerland by FIFA's Executive Committee. Under this policy, a 2018 bid {{could have come from}} North America, Asia, Europe, or Oceania, as Africa and South America are ineligible. Likewise, no CONMEBOL member <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> 2022 bid, and candidates from the same confederation as the successful 2018 applicant would be disregarded in the 2022 selection procedure.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{did take}} the Norwegian pilot and skier Tryggve Gran to the Antarctic on the {{recommendation}} of Nansen to train his expedition to ski, but although a few of his party began to learn, he made no arrangements for compulsory training for the full party. Gran (possibly because he was Norwegian) {{was not included in the}} South Pole party, which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> difference. Gran was, one year later, the first to locate the deceased Scott and his remaining companions in their tent just some 18km (11 miles) short of One Ton depot, that might have saved their lives had they reached it.|$|E
25|$|During the 2006 playoffs the two rivals met again. San Antonio won {{the first}} game at home 87–85. The Mavericks got revenge the next game, winning 113–91 and evening the series up at 1–1. The Mavericks then won a {{dramatic}} Game 3 by a single point, 104–103. Though Manu Ginóbili <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> game-winning basket with five seconds on the clock, he committed an error, allowing the ball to bounce away from him with one second remaining. Dallas won a tightly-contested Game 4 123–118 in overtime. The Spurs proceeded to avoid elimination by taking Game 5. In the final seconds of the game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt, leading to his suspension for Game 6. He was sorely missed as the Spurs won, taking the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 seconds to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime. Manu Ginóbili, who fouled Dirk on the play, had just given San Antonio their first lead one possession earlier. Tim Duncan, who had played in all 48 minutes of regulation, was too fatigued to carry his team in overtime. The Mavericks, meanwhile, were set {{to take control of}} the game and they did just that, winning 119–111. The Mavericks went on to the Conference Finals where they defeated the Suns in six games, but succumbed to the champion Heat in the NBA Finals.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of the appeal, rumours {{surfaced}} that Miller {{was having an affair with}} one of her players. While the allegations were unfounded, their timing resulted in James being falsely accused of being their source. Hockey Canada officials determined that the rumours were started by a third party attempting to create controversy. They also rejected James' appeal, ending her Olympic dream. Neither her teammates nor her opponents could understand how she was left off the team. Canada and the United States met in the final, as expected, but it was the Americans who emerged victorious. [...] Having already defeated Canada 7–4 in the preliminary round, the Americans won the gold medal with a 3–1 victory.

[...] "You Rock My World" [...] was commercially successful worldwide and peaked at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Jackson's first top ten song in the United States in over six years, and his last in the country until [...] "Love Never Felt So Good" [...] (a duet with Justin Timberlake) hit number 9 in 2014. This success was achieved on airplay alone, as the song was not released as a commercial single in the United States. [...] "You Rock My World" [...] topped the French music chart for three consecutive weeks. It also reached the top ten in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.|$|E

But I don’t think I was the right person to make a great Thor out of the story they wanted to do."

After Thor eventually does travel to Earth, he and Jane would have discovered that Malekith was [...] "hiding the dark energy inside of Earth because he knows that Odin doesn't care about Earth, and so he's using Odin's disinterest in Earth to trick him." ...|$|E
500|$|Since the mid–1970s, {{references}} to Four Years Among the Cannibals {{have continued to}} appear in studies on New Guinea. In the 1990s, Detzner's work received some rehabilitation from ethnographer Terence Hays, who placed Detzner's work in its contemporary context: [...] Four Years Among the Cannibals, he wrote, [...] "paved the way for me [...] by creating romanticized images {{that served as a}} backdrop for more serious readings". [...] Since then, geographer Robert Linke has raised some important questions: [...] "Why did Detzner resort to lies to embellish his wonderful story? The unadorned truth would have been enough to establish him {{as one of the great}} figures in New Guinea history." [...] Detzner had remained at large for four years, as a fugitive in enemy-held territory: surely, Linke concluded, this was an exceptional feat. No doubt the Australians <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> more broadly organized attempt to capture him, and probably would have succeeded, but they did not make the effort; they preferred instead the more convenient [...] "shoot-at-sight" [...] method. [...] "It is impossible", Linke wrote, [...] "not to admire his [...] sheer elan, his courage and tenacity." [...] In 2008, Detzner's book was retranslated, reprinted, and marketed as a modern translation of a rare and valuable book about the exploration of the New Guinean interior during World War I.|$|E

500|$|The {{external}} appearance of Holkham {{can best be}} described as a huge Roman palace. However, as with most architectural designs, it is never quite that simple. Holkham is a Palladian house, and yet even by Palladian standards the {{external appearance}} is austere and devoid of ornamentation. This can almost certainly be traced to Coke himself. The on-site, supervising architect, Matthew Brettingham, related that Coke required and demanded [...] "commodiousness", which can be interpreted as comfort. Hence rooms that were adequately lit by one window, had only one, as a second might have improved the external appearance but <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> room cold or draughty. As a result, the few windows on the piano nobile, although symmetrically placed and balanced, appear lost in a sea of brickwork; albeit these yellow bricks were cast as exact replicas of ancient Roman bricks expressly for Holkham. Above the windows of the piano nobile, where on a true Palladian structure the windows of a mezzanine would be, there is nothing. The reason for this is the double height of the state rooms on the piano nobile; however, not even a blind window, such as those often seen in Palladio's own work, is permitted to alleviate the severity of the facade. On the ground floor, the rusticated walls are pierced by small windows more reminiscent of a prison than a grand house. One architectural commentator, Nigel Nicolson, has described the house as appearing as functional as a Prussian riding school.|$|E
500|$|The Victorian all-rounder then top-scored with 123 {{and took}} a total of 4/48 in a nine-wicket win in the {{intervening}} county match against Middlesex at Lord’s, and he retained {{his place in the}} side for the Fourth Test at Leeds. Loxton was not involved in the second inning effort in which the Australians scored 3/404 on the final day, a world record for a successful Test run-chase, but he had taken three of the last four wickets in England’s first innings of 496 and scored a hard-hitting 93 in the first innings, putting on 105 in 95 minutes with Harvey. Their counterattacking partnership helped Australia to halt the English momentum after an early collapse; the score was still 4/189 when Loxton came in to bat. He was particularly severe on Jim Laker, lifting his off breaks into the crowd for four of his five sixes, mostly from lofted drives. With a maiden Test century beckoning, the Victorian swung wildly at a Norman Yardley ball and was bowled. In the dressing room, Sir Robert Menzies, a Prime Minister of Australia well known as a cricket-lover, upbraided him, saying [...] "That was a pretty stupid thing to do. You <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> century", to which the fallen batsman retorted, [...] "Haven’t you made a few mistakes in your time, too?" [...] Nevertheless, Australia eventually proceeded from 6/329 at the time of Loxton’s departure to end on 458, almost nullifying the effect of England’s strong first innings total.|$|E
500|$|However, Mercury and {{his inner}} circle of colleagues and friends, whom he felt he could trust, {{continually}} denied the stories, even after one front-page article published on 29 April 1991, showed Mercury appearing very haggard in what was by then a rare public appearance. It {{has been suggested that}} he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> contribution to AIDS awareness by speaking earlier about his situation and his fight against the disease. Mercury kept his condition private to protect those closest to him, with Brian May confirming in a 1993 interview he had informed the band of his illness much earlier. Filmed in May 1991, the music video for [...] "These Are the Days of Our Lives" [...] features a very thin Mercury, in what are his final scenes in front of the camera. The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, {{for an hour or two}} at a time. May says of Mercury: [...] "He just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.' He had no fear, really." [...] Justin Shirley-Smith, the assistant engineer for those last sessions, states: [...] "This is hard to explain to people, but it wasn't sad, it was very happy. He [...] was one of the funniest people I ever encountered. I was laughing most of the time, with him. Freddie was saying [...] 'I'm not going to think about it, I'm going to do this.' ...|$|E
