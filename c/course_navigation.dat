50|$|Each USMA cadet {{company and}} visiting team selects a 9-member squad (at least one member must be female) with two alternates. A West Point female cadet volunteers {{to work with}} the Afghan team's squad as there are no females at the NMAA. Each squad is {{required}} to perform a series of military tasks along a route which took most teams approximately four hours to complete. Scores are determined by combining the points they earn by performing each military task along the route, with the points earned for completing the course within the 4-hour time frame. Examples of events include rappelling, building and crossing a one-rope bridge, obstacle <b>course</b> <b>navigation,</b> combat swim (with full gear), rifle marksmanship, a raft paddle, 12' wall climb, and weapon handling skills. This year's weapons events were held the evening prior to the <b>course</b> <b>navigation</b> phase. In 2005, Britain's Prince Harry (then third in line for the British crown) visited West Point and participated in the competition as a Sandhurst cadet. In 2014, Sandhurst Blue from RMAS won the competition.|$|E

Depending on the license type and country's regulatory requirements, {{it is generally}} a flight carried out solo, {{near the end of}} student training towards a Private Pilots License (PPL) or Private Ultralight Pilot license. Normally the student would be expected to plan a triangular <b>course</b> <b>navigation</b> with one leg more than a specified distance and with one or more landings away from the home airfield.|$|E
50|$|While {{modeling}} the locomotion of pedestrians, {{there are a}} variety of things to take into account. Some of which include a driving force to the destination, repellent forces from coming obstacles and other agents and etc. All of these aspects are broken down into three layers. The basic layer is space discretization, which can be generalized as time and space. The second layer is the locomotion layer which takes into account the forces talked about earlier. Finally, the top layer is of <b>course</b> <b>navigation</b> where a path is traversed to the destination after everything has been taken into account.|$|E

5000|$|The crew's conduct {{following}} discontinuation of {{the first}} approach attempt is inexplicable. Although it must be assumed {{on the basis of}} the witness statements and the pilot of the flight path that the crew realised what a dangerous manoeuvre they had carried out - instead of the unbuilt-up and flat outlying ground of the aerodrome a densely populated and hilly area came into view even before the normal ILS approach minimum was reached - no fundamentally new safety measures were taken. Apparently only the certainly expedient change of pilot and, consequently, instruments took place, which admittedly resulted in accurately flown turns and courses but still did not rely on the marker beacon emissions which were essential for an ILS in view of the atmospheric disturbances. Instead of requesting the help of Air Traffic Control, who were intermittently occupied with other aircraft, or diverting to an alternate aerodrome, they may well have attempted, according to a possible interpretation of the tape recording, to make the second approach using only localizer and glide path and time and <b>course</b> <b>navigation,</b> which could not succeed in view of the [...] "bungled" [...] situation. The fact that the second approach was initiated with position report MN in the immediate vicinity of the BS beacon could be looked upon as a further confusion of navigational aids.|$|E
40|$|Based upon student feedback, {{content area}} experts at a small, private {{university}} decided to redesign their online courses through {{the addition of}} an e-authoring tool that allowed for easier <b>course</b> <b>navigation,</b> expanded content, interactives/quizzes with immediate feedback, and purposeful use of graphics, videos, and audio components. Student perception of impact of the e-authoring tool and its components were analyzed {{through the use of}} a mixed method approach using a Likert survey and qualitative comments. Student and instructor qualitative comments were also analyzed and coded to determine themes. Students reported a perceived positive impact of the e-authoring tool on content mastery and engagement. Students also reported that all five components of the e-authoring tool (web-based visual appearance, pictures and graphics, interactive practices, table of contents, and additional navigational links) were important components and should be included in online the module.

5000|$|Events in SFAS include {{numerous}} {{long distance}} land <b>navigation</b> <b>courses.</b> All land <b>navigation</b> <b>courses</b> are conducted {{day and night}} under heavy loads of equipment, in varied weather conditions, and in rough, hilly terrain. Land navigation work is done individually with no assistance from instructors or fellow students and is always done on a time limit. Each land <b>navigation</b> <b>course</b> has its maximum time limit reduced as course moves along and are upwards of 12 mi each. Instructors evaluate candidates by using obstacle course runs, team events including moving heavy loads such as telephone poles and old jeep trucks through sand as a 12-man team, the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT), a swim assessment, and numerous psychological exams such as IQ tests and the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) test. The final event, which was discontinued in early 2009 and reintroduced sometime before December 2013, is a road march of up to 32 mi known as [...] "the Trek" [...] or Long Range Individual Movement (LRIM).|$|R

40|$|This study {{researched}} {{the impact of}} strategic navigation improvements in an online course selected for the study over one quarter (12 weeks) at a large Midwestern private university. The {{primary purpose of the}} study was to see if navigation enhancements and specific graphic enhancements (semiotic tools) in the online course selected for the study could make it easier for adult students to learn new course materials. The study also sought to see if these factors could contribute to increased positive learning experiences and to see whether there might be a higher percentage of completion rates in this enhanced online course than in other online courses at the university. While not generalizable, the findings could provide inferences about which factors could positively influence adult learning in online courses and contribute to increased course completion rates; the study could also provide recommendations on graphic enhancements and online <b>course</b> <b>navigation</b> that positively influence student learning in online courses...|$|E
40|$|Responding to a student-expressed {{need for}} {{consistency}} among courses within the online Baccalaureate Nursing Completion program at Midwestern University, an instructional designer and nursing faculty member collaborated {{to build a}} course evaluation rubric, learning management system template, and corresponding matrix to help support student learning and retention as well as faculty autonomy and creativity. This effort carefully aligned the ADDIE approach with Rogers’ (2003) diffusion of innovation theory through frequent, meaningful communication with the nursing faculty and the interspersing of humor (thievery puns) to invigorate and inspire adoption. Beginning with {{the design of a}} rubric based on Quality Matters standards, the project evolved into a related template that demonstrated the application of the rubric concepts while incorporating faculty-developed content.

This study aims to examine quality indicators pertaining to the design and delivery of online instruction {{and its impact on}} students learning perspectives and outcomes. Quality indicators pertaining to course structure, course content, <b>course</b> <b>navigation,</b> and course assessments are used to examine their overall experience in taking online course. 110 undergraduate students responded to an online survey questionnaire. The findings indicated that ninety five percent of the students agreed that they received all the relevant information required to complete their assessments and ninety seven percent of them were comfortable in using the technology to submit their assignments. Challenges to online instruction included the impact of physical distance between instructor and student, adapting to the technology, and time management. We argue that it is equally significant to consider factors pertaining to the type, quality, and quantity of information presented to students, as online instruction demands a balance in the use of technology. We provide the lessons learned and recommendations for enhancing the quality of online instruction...|$|E
