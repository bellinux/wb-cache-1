5|$|Immediately {{outside the}} Malls, in {{the centre of}} Basingstoke's Wote Street stands Willie, the {{heaviest}} sculpture of a male organ on public display in the UK, weighing seven tons. The image of a mother and child is <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> side of the sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Beyond Polperro lies Talland Bay and Portnadler Bay, {{with the}} bird reserve of Looe Island (also known as St George's island) off shore. The path now enters Looe, passing through Hannafore, West Looe then, after {{crossing}} the River Looe on a seven-span bridge. The path continues {{up onto the}} cliff then heads towards Millendreath then along more cliffs, running past a 60-ft sevenfold labyrinth <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> turf of the hillside to Seaton, Downderry, and Portwrinkle.|$|E

5|$|Saint Paul's {{history and}} growth as a landing port {{are tied to}} water. The city's {{defining}} physical characteristic, {{the confluence of the}} Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, was <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> region during the last ice age, as were the steep river bluffs and dramatic palisades on which the city is built. Receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz forced torrents of water from a glacial river that undercut the river valleys. The city is situated in east-central Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|The Red Canyon Conglomerate, the basal {{member of}} the Moenkopi, fills broad east-flowing paleo{{channels}} <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Kaibab Limestone. Some of these channels are up to several tens of feet deep and may reach 200ft (61m) deep in the St. George area. A thin, poorly developed soil, or regolith, formed over the paleotopographic high areas between the channels.|$|E
5|$|The {{great auk}} was a food source for Neanderthals more than 100,000 years ago, as {{evidenced}} by well-cleaned bones found by their campfires. Images believed to depict the great auk also were <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> walls of the El Pendo Cave, Santander in Spain and Paglicci, Italy more than 35,000 years ago, and cave paintings 20,000 years old {{have been found in}} France's Grotte Cosquer.|$|E
50|$|The {{cutting ring}} fitting {{consists}} of the body, the cutting ring and the nut. On assembly, the two cutting edges of <b>the</b> cutting ring <b>carves</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> outer surface of the tube hence ensuring the necessary holding power and sealing for high operating pressures.

50|$|After the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, {{when the}} Latrun area was {{captured}} by Israel, the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway was once again constructed on the shortest route past Latrun and Sha'ar HaGai. Today's already four-lane wide Highway 1 is currently (2016) being widened due to increasing traffic, by further <b>carving</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> slopes of the Wadi Ali gorge.|$|R
5|$|Modern historians {{consider}} that some biographical—or autobiographical—texts are important historical documents. For example, the biographical stelas of military generals in tomb chapels built under Thutmose III provide {{much of the}} information known about the wars in Syria and Palestine. However, the annals of Thutmose III, <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> walls of several monuments built during his reign, such as those at Karnak, also preserve information about these campaigns. The annals of Ramesses II (r. 1279–1213 BC), recounting the Battle of Kadesh against the Hittites include, {{for the first time in}} Egyptian literature, a narrative epic poem, distinguished from all earlier poetry, which served to celebrate and instruct.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota {{has several}} sites {{administered}} by the National Park Service. Two national parks have been established in South Dakota, both in the state's southwestern part. Wind Cave National Park, established in 1903 in the Black Hills, has an extensive cave network {{as well as a}} large herd of bison. Badlands National Park was created in 1978. The park features an eroded, brightly colored landscape surrounded by semi-arid grasslands. Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills was established in 1925. The sculpture of four U.S. Presidents was <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mountainside by sculptor Gutzon Borglum.|$|E
5|$|South of {{the church}} stands a cloister {{surrounded}} by ranges of buildings on three sides, the church forming the fourth. As is known, the cloister was {{the heart of the}} abbey, where the monks spent most of their time when not in church, engaged in study, copying books and the creation of illuminated manuscripts. The monks' desks were placed in the north walk of the cloister, and a cupboard for books in current use was <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> external wall of the south transept.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Ambrosia artemissiifolia, Ambrosia acanthicarpa, Ambrosia chamissonis, Ambrosia confertiflora, Ambrosia dumosa, Ambrosia eriocentra, Ambrosia cumanensis, Pluchea rosea, Melanthera nivea, Helianthus annuus, Helianthus tuberosa, Xanthium strumarium and Cynara scolymus. They skeletonize {{the leaves}} of their host plant. They rest along the midrib of the upper leaf surface in {{depressions}} which they <b>carve</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> leaves.|$|R
50|$|The {{controls}} {{of the game}} received praise, with players only using three other keys for jumps, tricks and carving snow, along with the directional keys. Players hit the jump key to initiate a trick, the trick key is used to perform such tricks, and the third button allows characters to turn faster by <b>carving</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> snow.|$|R

5|$|The French motto Quant Je Puis (As Much as I Can) {{is central}} to the ethos of the school, which focuses upon the all-round {{development}} of the individual. It is inherited from the Shireburn family who once owned the original mansion on the site; the family emblem is emblazoned, in stone, with the motto, above the fireplace in the Top Refectory. At {{the far end of the}} same room, once the dining room of the Shireburns, the motto can be seen again, <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> minstrel's gallery: Quant Je Puis. Hugo Sherburn armig. me fieri fecit. Anno Domini 1523. Et sicut fuit sic fiat.|$|E
5|$|The iPad has two {{internal}} speakers reproducing {{left and}} right channel audio located on the bottom-right of the unit. In the original iPad, the speakers push sound through two small sealed channels leading to the three audio ports <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> device, while the iPad 2 has its speakers behind a single grill. A volume switch {{is on the right}} side of the unit. A 3.5-mm TRRS connector audio-out jack on the top-left corner of the device provides stereo sound for headphones with or without microphones and/or volume controls. The iPad also contains a microphone that can be used for voice recording.|$|E
5|$|The larger room is entered from {{an outer}} chamber. In the outer chamber is located the Burma Star window (1985) with the Kohima Epitaph. The Kohima Epitaph is <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 2nd British Division {{memorial}} and remembers {{those who fought}} in the Battle of Kohima in north east India {{in the spring of}} 1944 between the British and Japanese. It also constitutes a memorial to Major-General Lewis Pugh, of Cwmerau, Glandyfi, who fought in the Second World War in the Far East, and who is a kinsman of Brigadier-General Lewis Pugh Evans, VC, who is buried in the churchyard.|$|E
50|$|Also new to Reflex is {{real-time}} terrain deformation. Terrain deformation allows any of {{the different}} vehicles to literally <b>carve</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> earth creating ruts, berms, braking bumps and acceleration bumps as they actually do in real life. These ruts, berms and bumps are dynamic and constantly changing {{throughout the course of}} the race adding for an extra sense of realism.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the fiber}} output, an optical {{bandpass}} filter (OBPF) with a FWHM spectral width , (defined {{such that the}} pulse width at the output {{is the same as}} that at the input of the system), is spectrally offset by an amount [...] with respect to the input signal carrier wavelength [...] and is used to <b>carve</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> broadened spectrum - thereby acting as a pulse reshaper.|$|R
5|$|These expeditions {{departed}} Egypt {{from the}} port of Ain Sukhna, on the western shore of the Gulf of Suez, as revealed by papyri and seals bearing Djedkare Isesi's name found on the site. The port comprised large galleries <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sandstone serving as living quarters and storage places. The wall of one such gallery was inscribed with a text mentioning yet another expedition to the hills of turquoise {{in the year of}} the seventh cattle count–possibly Djedkare's 14th year on the throne.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, who thought the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E
5|$|At street level, three arched entranceways line Broad Street. The central arch is {{slightly}} larger than the others to indicate {{the entrance to the}} main banking hall. <b>Carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> facade above the center arch is the building's name. Inside the arches and above the doorways are windows designed by d'Ascenzo Studios. Leaded panes of glass of various shades of amber are surrounded by a Renaissance-style border. Below the windows are bronze doors, each with 24 high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization. Bas-relief figures decorate each of the arches' spandrels. A male figure with a hammer representing industry and a female figure with a beehive representing thrift decorate the center arch. The arch closest to Sansom Street is decorated by two figures with cornucopias to represent abundance. The arch nearer to Walnut Street is decorated by a painter and a sculptor to represent art.|$|E
50|$|The Nechako Canyon, {{also called}} the Grand Canyon of the Nechako, {{is now in a}} provincial {{protected}} area due to its striking landscape, formed by the course of <b>the</b> Nechako River <b>carving</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> plateau's lava and lined with pinnacles and overhanging cliff. It begins at the outlet of the Nechako Reservoir at Kenny Dam and ends at Cheslatta Falls, an 18m drop which is the last leg of the Cheslatta River.|$|R
50|$|Base {{level is}} the {{elevation}} of the surface of <b>the</b> water body <b>into</b> which a river ultimately drains, usually the ocean. A drop in base level causes a response by the river system to <b>carve</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> landscape. This incision begins at {{the formation of a}} knickpoint, and its upstream migration depends heavily upon the drainage area (and so the discharge of the river), material through which it cuts, and how large the drop in base level was.|$|R
50|$|In {{the film}} Inglourious Basterds <b>the</b> protagonists <b>carve</b> swastikas <b>into</b> <b>the</b> foreheads of {{surviving}} German soldiers, {{to make their}} malfeasance known to all in the future.|$|R
5|$|Badami, also {{referred}} to as Vatapi, Vatapipura, Vatapinagari and Agastya Tirtha in historical texts, the capital of Chalukya dynasty in the 6th century, is at the exit point of a ravine between two steep mountain cliffs. Four cave temples in the escarpment of the hill to the south-east of the town were <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cliff's monolithic stone face. The escarpment is above a man made lake called Agastya Lake, created by an earthen dam faced with stone steps. To the west end of this cliff, at its lowest point, is the first cave temple. The largest and highest cave is Cave 3, which is further to the east on the northern face of the hill. The fourth cave, Cave 4, is a few steps down further east.|$|E
5|$|Items include granite pavers {{that have}} {{memories}} of past Hillsboro citizens <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stone and photographs etched onto glass. Photographs range from pioneer times {{to life in}} the 1990s. There are also letters etched in glass from people such as Albert E. Tozier, Robert Summer, Chavela Mendoza, Lester C. Mooberry, Mary Ramsey Wood, George Iwasaki, and Howard Vollum. Gunfights, hangings, funerals, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the Great Depression, and an outbreak of diphtheria in the 1890s are among the events represented. More recent photographs show the defunct Oregon Electric Railway, which the westside line often uses the old right-of-way of the former line, and employees at Intel dressed in cleanroom suits.|$|E
5|$|Like {{several other}} chalk figures <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> English countryside, the Cerne Abbas Giant is {{often thought of}} as an ancient creation. However, as {{with many of the}} other figures, its history cannot be traced back further than the late 17th century, making an origin during the Celtic, Roman or even Early Medieval periods {{difficult}} to demonstrate. Medieval sources refer to the hill on which the giant is located as Trendle Hill – possibly in reference to the nearby landmark known as the Trendle. Joseph Bettey noted that none of the earlier sources for the area, including a detailed 1617 land survey, refer to the giant, suggesting that it might not have been there at the time. In contrast, the Uffington White Horse {{has been shown to be}} 3,000 years old, and there are references to it across the ages.|$|E
50|$|In the Australian mining {{towns of}} Coober Pedy and Lightning Ridge, many {{families}} have <b>carved</b> homes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> underground opal mines, {{to escape the}} burning desert heat.|$|R
5000|$|The Pipestone Region {{is an area}} {{in southwestern}} Minnesota. The area was named for its supply of pipestone (catlinite), a type of {{limestone}} which local Indians <b>carved</b> <b>into</b> pipes. <b>The</b> area is also noted for quartzite quarries.|$|R
