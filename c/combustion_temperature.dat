25|$|The very-high {{temperature}} of lightning naturally produces {{small amounts of}} NOx, NH3, and HNO3, but high-temperature combustion has contributed to a 6 or 7 fold increase in the flux of NOx to the atmosphere. Its production {{is a function of}} <b>combustion</b> <b>temperature</b> - the higher the temperature, the more NOx is produced. Fossil fuel combustion is a primary contributor, but so are biofuels and even the burning of hydrogen. The higher <b>combustion</b> <b>temperature</b> of hydrogen produces more NOx than natural gas combustion.|$|E

25|$|If {{the black}} liquor dry solids is below 20% or water content in black liquor is above 80% the net heating value of black liquor is negative.

50|$|One of {{the primary}} {{concerns}} in internal combustion emissions is a factor called the NOx fraction, or the amount of nitrogen/oxygen compounds the engine produces. This level is government regulated for emissions as commonly seen at inspection stations. High compression causes high <b>combustion</b> <b>temperatures.</b> High <b>combustion</b> <b>temperatures</b> lead to higher NOx emissions, thus forced induction can give higher NOx fractions.|$|R
25|$|Emissions may {{be reduced}} through more {{efficient}} and higher <b>combustion</b> <b>temperature</b> and through more efficient production of electricity within the cycle. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) of emissions from coal-fired power stations is another alternative but the technology is still being developed and will increase the cost of fossil fuel-based production of electricity. CCS may not be economically viable, unless the price of emitting CO2 to the atmosphere rises.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{pyrotechnic}} compositions, {{for example}} MTV, give a great flame emission upon combustion and yield a temperature-dependent signature {{and can be}} understood as gray bodies of high emissivity (~0.95). Such payloads are called blackbody payloads. Other payloads, like iron/potassium perchlorate pellets, only yield a low flame emission but also show temperature-dependent signature. Nevertheless, the lower <b>combustion</b> <b>temperature</b> as compared to MTV results in a lower amount of energy released in the short-wavelength IR range. Other blackbody payloads include ammonium perchlorate/anthracene/magnesium and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) binder.|$|E
25|$|Color and {{temperature}} of a flame {{are dependent on}} the type of fuel involved in the combustion, as, for example, when a lighter is held to a candle. The applied heat causes the fuel molecules in the candle wax to vaporize. In this state they can then readily react with oxygen in the air, which gives off enough heat in the subsequent exothermic reaction to vaporize yet more fuel, thus sustaining a consistent flame. The high temperature of the flame causes the vaporized fuel molecules to decompose, forming various incomplete combustion products and free radicals, and these products then react {{with each other and with}} the oxidizer involved in the reaction. Sufficient energy in the flame will excite the electrons in some of the transient reaction intermediates such as the Methylidyne radical (CH) and Diatomic carbon (C2), which results in the emission of visible light as these substances release their excess energy (see spectrum below for an explanation of which specific radical species produce which specific colors). As the <b>combustion</b> <b>temperature</b> of a flame increases (if the flame contains small particles of unburnt carbon or other material), so does the average energy of the electromagnetic radiation given off by the flame (see Black body).|$|E

40|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{continues}} to tighten pollutant emission regulations throughout the United States. As a result, {{the need to}} reduce air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) remains a challenge for pipeline operators. NOx formation is primarily a function of in-cylinder <b>combustion</b> <b>temperatures.</b> A challenge for engine researchers is to identify methods to lower <b>combustion</b> <b>temperatures</b> while maintaining complete combustion. Blending hydrogen into an engine’s fuel can lower in-cylinder <b>combustion</b> <b>temperatures</b> and reduce pollutant emissions. Hydrogen has a wider flammability range in comparison to natural gas, which allows for leaner engine operation and lower <b>combustion</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Specifically, the very high molecular diffusivity of hydrogen creates a more uniform mixture of fuel and air. Hydrogen also has very low ignition energy, which translates into easier combustion. This paper presents test results of using hydrogen as a fuel additive for a large bore, two stroke cycle, single cylinder, natural gas fueled Ajax engine in a test laboratory. The engine was first operated at the test point on pure natural gas and allowed to stabilize. Then a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas at various molar percentages wa...|$|R

2500|$|The Rayleigh flow {{model has}} many {{analytical}} uses, most notably involving aircraft engines.

[...] These properties make the Rayleigh flow model applicable for heat addition to the flow through combustion, assuming the heat addition does not result in dissociation of the air-fuel mixture. [...] Producing a shock wave inside the combustion chamber of an engine due to thermal choking is very undesirable due to the decrease in mass flow rate and thrust. [...] Therefore, the Rayleigh flow model is critical for an initial design of the duct geometry and <b>combustion</b> <b>temperature</b> for an engine.|$|E

40|$|Burning fuels in an O 2 /H 2 O {{atmosphere}} {{is regarded as}} the next generation of oxy-fuel combustion for CO 2 capture and storage (CCS). By combining oxy-fuel combustion and biomass utilization technology, CO 2 emissions could be further reduced. Therefore, this work focuses on investigating the combustion characteristics of single particles from bituminous coal (BC) and pine sawdust (PS) in O 2 /N 2, O 2 /CO 2 and O 2 /H 2 O atmospheres at different O 2 mole fractions (21 %, 30 %, and 40 %). The experiments were carried out in a drop tube furnace (DTF), and a high-speed camera was used to record the combustion processes of fuel particles. The <b>combustion</b> <b>temperatures</b> were measured by a two-color method. The results reveal that the particles from BC and PS all ignite homogeneously. Replacing N 2 by CO 2 results in a longer ignition delay time and lower <b>combustion</b> <b>temperatures.</b> After substituting H 2 O for N 2, the ignition delay time is shortened, which is mainly caused by the steam gasification reaction (C + H 2 O → CO + H 2) and steam shift reaction (CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2). In addition, the <b>combustion</b> <b>temperatures</b> are first decreased at low O 2 mole fractions, and then increased at high O 2 mole fractions because the oxidation effect of H 2 O performs a more important role than its volumetric heat capacity and thermal radiation capacity.
