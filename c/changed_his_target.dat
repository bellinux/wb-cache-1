Some variants allow [...] "poison", which can be implemented by adding strong flavors such as Tabasco sauce to the victim's food or a piece of paper placed underneath the victim's food with the word poison written on it. Another form is the use of a [...] "black spot". If a player opens a paper, sealed with tape, staples or any other of such, and there is a black spot inside, the player is eliminated.|$|R

5000|$|After the Polish Constitution of March 1921 {{severely}} limited {{the powers of}} the presidency (intentionally, to prevent a President Piłsudski from waging war), Piłsudski declined to run for the office. On 9 December 1922 the Polish National Assembly elected Gabriel Narutowicz of Polish People's Party [...] "Wyzwolenie"; his election, opposed by the right-wing parties, caused public unrest. On 14 December at the Belweder Palace, Piłsudski officially transferred his powers as Chief of State to his friend Narutowicz; the Naczelnik was replaced by the President.Two days later, on 16 December 1922, Narutowicz was shot dead by a right-wing painter and art critic, Eligiusz Niewiadomski, who had originally wanted to kill Piłsudski but had <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>target,</b> influenced by National-Democrat anti-Narutowicz propaganda.|$|E
50|$|Some years later, {{when the}} regent of Shu, Zhuge Liang, {{deployed}} {{for his second}} campaign against the rival state of Wei, the Wei marshal, Cao Zhen, correctly predicted Zhuge's route of advancement, and recommended Hao Zhao to build fortifications for Chencang, assuring the young emperor, Cao Rui, of the defense. However, Hao Zhao was only assigned 1,000 men for the building project. After the failure on Mount Qi and Jieting, the Shu regent indeed <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>target</b> to Chencang as Cao Zhen foresaw. This time, Zhuge Liang brought with him a selection of siege weapons, and 100,000 troops. He determined to march through Chencang, {{in order to establish}} a foothold for further military actions. When the attackers reached the fortress-city, the defences had not been completed as Cao Zhen had not sent additional forces as reinforcements.|$|E
5000|$|On May 31, 1947, as Peng Dehuai {{learned the}} news of the defeat of the {{communist}} 2nd Column, he immediately <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>target</b> of his next battle by telegraphing Mao Zedong on the same day with the local communist party boss Xi Zhongxun, claiming that:”The 82nd Division of the Ma clique in Qinghai was very tough and our force had concentrated in preparation for first annihilating the 81st Division of Ma clique in Ningxia, and then to strike the 82nd Division.” Half a month later, the communist scored a victory in Huan (环) county against the nationalist 81st Division of Ma clique in Ningxia, {{but it was not until}} the Xifu Campaign in 1948 did Peng Dehuai was able to fulfill his wish of engaging the nationalist 82nd Division of the Ma clique in Qinghai, but once again, the communist was defeated. Also on May 31, 1947, the political commissar of the communist 2nd Column, Wang Enmao (...) wrote in his diary admitting that the defeat with extreme heavy casualties, which caused the delay of the Eastern Gansu Campaign planned by the communists. On June 1, 1947, Wang Zhen telegraphed Peng Dehuai and Xi Zhongxun to report that the campaign was lost and Wang Zhen himself was responsible, claiming that the forces of Ma clique in Qinghai was very capable, and they acted swiftly and bravely in battles, and this was not an exaggeration to make any excuses. The communist 359th Brigade along suffered over 800 fatalities and had exhausted most of the ammunition, and thus had to retreat to a different region for several days to regroup and re-supply.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the primary}} goals of teacher edu-cation is to enlarge the {{capacity}} of the teacher to control his teaching behavior. Hunt (6) has likened this to the training of therapists. He has pointed out that the goal of training for therapy is neither to produce persons who are always reflective (nondirective), nor to train persons always to counsel in a structured manner. The &dquo;good&dquo; therapist can be reflective when nondirection is appropriate and structured when direction is appropriate. He <b>changes</b> <b>his</b> professional behavior as <b>his</b> <b>target</b> shifts. So it is with teachers. A teacher who cannot help children discover principles for themselves is a cripple of sorts; for the discovery method, {{as far as we can}} specu-late, is uniquely useful for particular edu-cational purposes. On the other hand, a teacher who could employ only dialectical or discovery methods would be equall...|$|R

5000|$|Following Kelsey and Loveita's evictions, the HouseGuests {{hoped to}} take control in the Blast From the Past Head of Household competition. In this competition, HouseGuests were asked {{questions}} based on items contained in a time capsule given to the HouseGuests. The HouseGuest with the most points {{will be the new}} Head of Household. Tim was the winner. On Day 29, HouseGuests were given the task to play [...] "Big Brother Says". HouseGuests must perform all tasks Big Brother gives them. The HouseGuests passed their task and earned a pizza party. Tim chose to hold a house meeting and revealed that his nominations would be based on a HouseGuests vote with the voting rules being adopted from his season of Big Brother Australia. Each HG had 5 nomination points (represented by Gummy Koalas from his HoH box) to give to 2 HouseGuests. Most of the HouseGuest voted according to Tim's rules but Dallas chose not to participate, leading to Dallas himself getting 5 Koala as a penalty. On Day 29, Tim nominated Dallas (who has received 30 Koalas) and Ramsey (who received 9 Koalas) for eviction. On Day 30, Tim, Dallas, and Ramsey chose Cassandra, Jared, and Mitch to play in the End of the Rainbow Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to roll their ball past the obstacles and up and over their rainbow and catch it on the other side. If a HouseGuest drops their ball, their counter will drop to zero. The first HouseGuest to roll their ball 300 times without dropping it will win the Power of Veto. Ramsey won the Power of Veto. On Day 32, Ramsey took himself off the block, and Tim named Maddy as the replacement nominee. On Day 33, Emmett surprised Kelsey and Loveita to give them the secret task to hide black and white poker chips throughout the House. The HouseGuests were then split into team to find their team's poker chips in ten minutes. The team who finds more poker chips will receive a reward, and the losing team will receive a punishment. The white team of Ramsey, Nick & Phil, Joel, Cassandra, and Raul won and received a cocktail party with Emmett and Tim. The black team of Dallas, Jared, Maddy, Mitch, and Nikki lost and were forced to clean the House. Despite Dallas receiving the most votes on the gummy koala poll, Tim <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>target</b> to Maddy, hatching a plan to use his tie breaking vote to backdoor her. On Day 35, however, neither Nikki nor Ramsey sided with Tim, and as a result, Dallas was evicted by a 5-3 vote, with Cassandra, Joel, and Nick & Phil voting to evict Maddy.|$|E
30|$|When 1923 Kanto {{earthquake}} (M 7.9) destroyed Yokohama and Tokyo severely, Kinkichi Musha [1891 – 1962], {{who was a}} {{high school}} English teacher and involved in words compilation for English–Japanese dictionary, <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>target</b> of collection from English words to the historical materials related to earthquakes. Since 1928, Torahiko Terada [1878 – 1935], who was the famous physicist and the essayist, encouraged Musha’s effort. Terada was instrumental in the establishment of the Earthquake Research Institute (ERI), and was considered as the affectionate father to young scientists at ERI. After Terada passed away, Akitsune Imamura [1870 – 1948] sponsored Musha. He mainly compiled information from documents available in the Ueno imperial library in Tokyo, where most historical materials were gathered from former clans’ colleges for samurais in the Edo era. He added his compilation to Tayama’s, and published them in mimeograph printing. The first volume (Musha 1941) was published before the Pacific War began, and the quality of it was not bad. The print and paper quality of the second and third volumes (Musha 1943 a, b) was very poor {{due to the lack of}} supplies in Japan, even 2  years before the end of the war. It is often very difficult to interpret even in its original print.|$|E

5000|$|More recently, {{film critic}} Dennis Schwartz gave the film a more {{favorable}} review, writing, [...] "This action-packed one-hour mystery story was the first film in a series spun off from the successful radio program of the '30s and '40s. It starts off with some whistling and a monologue by the unseen Whistler, {{just as it was}} done on radio: 'I am the Whistler...and I know many things, for I walk by night.' ... This well-done suspense story continues with the panicky Earl trying to track down the killer to cancel the contract, while the killer thinks he can scare <b>his</b> <b>target</b> to death by just tailing him. The film's theme is that man cannot <b>change</b> <b>his</b> destiny, and if his destiny is to die by murder...that's what it will be. The Whistler states at the end: 'I know because I am the Whistler.' The result is an entertaining B film." ...|$|R
