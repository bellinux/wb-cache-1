Reluctantly, Ahab orders the harpooneers {{to inspect the}} casks. Queequeg, sweating all day below decks, develops a <b>chill</b> <b>and</b> soon is almost mortally feverish. The carpenter makes a coffin for Queequeg, who fears an ordinary burial at sea. Queequeg tries it for size, with Pip sobbing and beating his tambourine, standing by and calling himself a coward while he praises Queequeg for his gameness. Yet Queequeg suddenly rallies, briefly convalesces, and leaps up, back in good health. Henceforth, he uses his coffin for a spare seachest, which is later caulked and pitched to replace the Pequods life buoy.|$|E
40|$|Chilling (0 - 18 °C) and {{freezing}} (< 0 °C) are two distinct types of cold stresses. Epigenetic regulation {{can play an}} important role in plant adaptation to abiotic stresses. However, it is not yet clear whether and how epigenetic modification (i. e., DNA methylation) mediates the adaptation to cold stresses in nature (e. g., in alpine regions). Especially, whether the adaptation to <b>chilling</b> <b>and</b> freezing is involved in differential epigenetic regulations in plants is largely unknown. Chorispora bungeana is an alpine subnival plant that is distributed in the freeze-thaw tundra in Asia, where <b>chilling</b> <b>and</b> freezing frequently fluctuate daily (24 h). To disentangle how C. bungeana copes with these intricate cold stresses through epigenetic modifications, plants of C. bungeana were treated at 4 °C (<b>chilling)</b> <b>and</b> - 4 °C (freezing) over five periods of time (0 - 24 h). Methylation-sensitive amplified fragment-length polymorphism markers were used to investigate the variation in DNA methylation of C. bungeana in response to <b>chilling</b> <b>and</b> freezing. It was found that the alterations in DNA methylation of C. bungeana largely occurred over the period of <b>chilling</b> <b>and</b> freezing. Moreover, <b>chilling</b> <b>and</b> freezing appeared to gradually induce distinct DNA methylation variations, as the treatment went on (e. g., after 12 h). Forty-three cold-induced polymorphic fragments were randomly selected and further analyzed, and three of the cloned fragments were homologous to genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase, UDP-glucosyltransferase and polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein. These candidate genes verified the existence of different expressive patterns between <b>chilling</b> <b>and</b> freezing. Our results showed that C. bungeana responded to cold stresses rapidly through the alterations of DNA methylation, <b>and</b> that <b>chilling</b> <b>and</b> freezing induced different DNA methylation changes. Therefore, we conclude that epigenetic modifications can potentially serve as a rapid and flexible mechanism for C. bungeana to adapt to the intricate cold stresses in the alpine areas...|$|R

500|$|Ross {{had always}} been an avid hunter, and he {{embarked}} on a hunting trip along the Navasota River with his son Neville and several family friends during Christmas vacation in 1897. While hunting, he suffered acute indigestion and a severe <b>chill</b> <b>and</b> decided to go home early while the others continued their sport. He arrived in College Station on December 30 and consulted a doctor. Ross remained in pain for several days, {{and in the early}} evening of January 3, 1898, he died, aged 59years and 3months. Although no death certificate was filed, [...] "evidence points to a coronary heart attack as the probable cause of death." [...] The entire Texas AMC student body accompanied Ross's body back to Waco, where Confederate veterans in gray uniforms formed an honor guard. Several thousand people attended Ross's burial at Oakwood Cemetery. To further memorialize him, students at Texas AMC held the first Silver Taps ceremony, a tradition still followed when a current student at Texas A dies.|$|E
500|$|Balzac's {{trademark}} realism {{begins on}} the first page of the novel, wherein Crevel is described wearing a National Guard uniform, complete with the Légion d'honneur. Details from the 1830s also appear in the novel's geographic locations. The Hulot family home, for example, is found in the aristocratic area of Paris known as the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Bette's residence is on {{the opposite end of the}} social spectrum, in the impoverished residential area which surrounded the Louvre: [...] "Les ténèbres, le silence, l'air glacial, la profondeur caverneuse du sol concourent à faire de ces maisons des espèces de cryptes, des tombeaux vivants." [...] ("Darkness, silence, an icy <b>chill,</b> <b>and</b> the cavernous depth of the soil combine to make these houses a kind of crypt, tombs of the living.") Descriptions of her meager quarters are– as usual in Balzac's work– an acute reflection of her personality. The same is true of the Marneffe home at the outset: it contains [...] "les trompeuses apparences de ce faux luxe" [...] ("the illusory appearance of sham luxury"), from the shabby chairs in the drawing-room to the dust-coated bedroom.|$|E

This extensive building is used during the milder {{months of the year}} for horticultural shows, concerts and miscellaneous gatherings. In the winter the doors of this place are thronged with a crowd of sleighs and sleigh drivers, while inside, skaters and spectators form a living, moving panorama, pleasant to look upon. The place is lighted by gas, and men and women, old and young, with a plentiful sprinkling of children, on skates, are practicing all sorts of gyrations. The ladies are prettily and appropriately dressed in skating costumes, {{and some of them are}} proficient in the art of skating. The spectators sit or stand on a raised lege around the ice parallelogram, while the skaters dart off, singly or in pairs, executing quadrilles, waltzes, curves, straight lines, letters, labyrinths, and every conceivable figure. Now and then some one comes to grief in the surging, moving throng; but is quickly on his or her feet again, the ice and water shaken off, and the zigzag resumed. Children skate; boys and girls; ladies and gentlemen, and even dignified military officers. Some skate well, some medium, some shockingly ill; but all skate, or essay to do so. It is the grand Montrealese pastime, and though the ice is sloppy, and the air <b>chill</b> <b>and</b> heavy with moisture, everybody has a good time.” ...|$|E
500|$|The band began {{recording}} demos of {{new material}} in 2009. All three members brought song ideas that {{they worked on}} for years. As the band got back together, Barker said that the trio immediately [...] "got inspired" [...] by practicing their old songs and listening to them again, {{and they decided to}} record demos. There were four demos done, and only one was near completion, [...] "Up All Night". The trio wanted to release it as a single then, but quickly they realized that it was too ambitious to complete it before their reunion tour began in July. Sessions were stalled by the summer 2009 reunion tour, during which the band reconnected musically and emotionally. During the tour, Barker got the phone call that DJ AM had overdosed and died in New York, which heavily affected him. In addition to the tragedy regarding DJ AM, DeLonge was diagnosed with skin cancer the following year, but it eventually was cleared. The band did a large amount of writing before leaving on tour, but upon completion of the tour, they took time off to [...] "take a couple of months and <b>chill</b> <b>and</b> do other stuff," [...] with intentions to regroup in 2010.
