25|$|Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, Doctorow's first novel, was {{published}} in January 2003, {{and was the first}} novel released under one of the Creative Commons licences, allowing readers to circulate the electronic edition as long as they neither made money from it nor used it to create derived works. The electronic edition was released simultaneously with the print edition. In March 2003, it was re-released with a different <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>licence</b> that allowed derivative works such as fan fiction, but still prohibited commercial usage. It was nominated for a Nebula Award, and won the Locus Award for Best First Novel in 2004. A semi-sequel short story named Truncat {{was published}} on Salon.com in August 2003.|$|E
500|$|Similar to the {{announcement}} that ultimately led {{to the release of}} Ghosts I–IV, a post on the band's website in April 2008 read [...] "2 weeks!" [...] On May 5, Nine Inch Nails released The Slip via their website without any advertisement or promotion. The album was made available for download free of charge with a message from Reznor, [...] "this one's on me," [...] protected under the same <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>licence</b> as Ghosts, and has seen individual downloads surpassing 1.4million. [...] The Slip has since been released on CD as a limited edition set of 250,000.|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} whether <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>licences</b> {{are applicable}} to and compatible with design. The first part {{focuses on the}} peculiar and complex nature of a design, which can benefit from a copyright and a design protection. This shows how it can affect the use of <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>licences.</b> The second and third parts deal with a specific case study. Some Internet platforms have recently emerged that offer users the possibility to download blueprints of design products {{in order to build}} them. Designers and creative users are invited to share their blueprints and creations under <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>licences.</b> The second part of the article assesses whether digital blueprints can be copyrightable and serve as the subject matter of <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>licences,</b> while the last part assesses whether the right to reproduce the digital blueprint, as provided by <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>licences,</b> extends to the right to build the product...|$|R

500|$|The release {{also drew}} criticism. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who {{independently}} released his sixth album Ghosts I-IV under a <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>licence</b> the following year, thought {{it did not}} go far enough, calling it [...] "very much a bait and switch, {{to get you to}} pay for a MySpace-quality stream as a way to promote a very traditional record sale." [...] Singer Lily Allen called it [...] "arrogant", saying: [...] " [...] millions of pounds. It sends a weird message to younger bands who haven't done as well. You don't choose how to pay for eggs. Why should it be different for music?" [...] In the Guardian, journalist Will Hodgkinson wrote: [...] "Spare a thought for the thousands upon thousands of bands and singers who, nowhere near Radiohead's levels of fame and fortune, now have pretty much no chance of ever making a living from their music." [...] Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth told the Guardian the release [...] "seemed really community-oriented, but it wasn't catered towards their musician brothers and sisters, who don’t sell as many records as them. It makes everyone else look bad for not offering their music for whatever." ...|$|E

40|$|Digital {{technology}} presents ongoing {{challenges to}} the traditional copyright model. This paper discusses and critiques one response to these challenges: <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>licences.</b> Although there are many positive features of <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>licences,</b> certain aspects have attracted criticism. This paper describes the positive features of the licences, considers {{some of the more}} contentious issues and concludes that until community norms and expectations in relation to digital creative works align more with the current legal environment for those works provided by copyright law, any attempt to reconceptualise that legal environment by working within its constraints is unlikely to be successful. In other words, the perceived failures of <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>licences</b> may be a symptom of a broader problem - the failure of the copyright system itself to engage with the community...|$|R

40|$|Since its {{launch in}} 2001, the <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> open content {{licensing}} initiative has received both praise and censure.

This paper aims to provide a brief overview {{and analysis of the}} practical application of the <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>licences</b> five years after their launch. It looks at how the <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> <b>licences</b> are being used and who is using them, and attempts to identify likely motivations for doing so. By identifying trends in how this licence use has changed over time, it also attempts to rebut arguments that <b>Creative</b> <b>Commons</b> is a movement of academics and hobbyists, and has no value for traditional organisations or working artists...|$|R
