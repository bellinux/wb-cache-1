40|$|The {{spectral}} reflectance {{of snow in}} the range of 0. 60 to 2. 50 microns wavelengths was studied in a <b>cold</b> <b>laboratory</b> using natural snow and simulated preparations of snow. A white barium sulfate powder was used as the standard for comparison. The high reflectance (usually nearly 100 %) of fresh natural snow in visible wavelengths declines rapidly at wavelengths longer than the visible, as the spectral absorption coefficients of ice increase. Aging snow becomes only somewhat less reflective than fresh snow in the visible region and usually retains a reflectance greater than 80 %. In the near infrared, aging snow tends to become considerably less reflective than fresh snow...|$|E

Here, through <b>cold</b> <b>laboratory</b> mechanical tests with a new shear apparatus we demonstrate time-dependent effects of isothermal sintering on interface strengthening at various normal pressures. Measurements showed that interfacial strength evolved rapidly, conforming to a power law (mean exponent ≈ 0. 21); higher pressure corresponded to higher initial strength and sintering rates.

The hydrodynamic simulation is achieved by matching five dimensionless parameters. Particular care is taken to eliminate electrostatics from the bed using traces of an anti-static additive.

40|$|The {{study is}} based on {{experimental}} work conducted in alpine snow. We made microwave radiometric and near-infrared reflectance measurements of snow slabs under different experimental conditions. We used an empirical relation to link near-infrared reflectance of snow to the specific surface area (SSA), and converted the SSA into the correlation length. From the measurements of snow radiances at 21 and 35 [*]GHz, we derived the microwave scattering coefficient by inverting two coupled radiative transfer models (the sandwich and six-flux model).

Vertical profiles of static pressure and radial profiles of particle volume fraction are compared in experiments simulating atmospheric and pressurized conditions.

40|$|International audienceHere we show {{preliminary}} results of shear tests {{carried out with}} a new shear test apparatus designed and constructed by Politecnico di Torino, DISEG (Italy). The ultimate objective of the work is to develop an instrument for in situ measurements of the mechanical properties of weak snow layers. At the present, it is a portable force-controlled apparatus with adjustable shear-loading rate and normal pressure for specimen dimensions 0. 16 m × 0. 16 m × 0. 08 m. The first series of <b>cold</b> <b>laboratory</b> experiments were focused on calibration, experimental methodology, and, in particular, on sintering (conducted at CEN / Météo-France). As an illustration of the instrument’s performance, here we show a set of tests dedicated to sintering effects on snow interface strengthening with time. The protocol of experiments could be briefly described as follows: two snow blocks were placed {{on top of one another}} and immediately subjected to rapid horizontal loading at a constant rate of about 19 N s− 1 (i. e., effectively cutting the sintering time to zero); then the same samples were left for four hours and re-tested; finally, the same procedure was repeated after 16 more hours. For each test, shear displacements and force were recorded with high-frequency gauges. Interfacial strength evolved rapidly under constant normal pressure, air temperature and relative humidity (about 0. 1 kPa, − 10 °C, and 70 %, respectively) and corresponded to an increase of failure load by an order of magnitude (about 0. 3 kPa h− 1; that is comparable to field measurements by Birkeland et al., 2006). Following further <b>cold</b> <b>laboratory</b> testing with various types of snow and, possibly, some technical modifications, we intend to continue the development of the instrument for its future usage in the field at slab avalanche release zones...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Snow samples (115 mm in diameter, 16 - 18 mm in height) {{were taken}} from the field and shortly {{afterwards}} tested in a <b>cold</b> <b>laboratory</b> using a direct simple shear apparatus of Norwegian manufacture. The effects of strain rate and tem-perature on snow strength, stiffness and toughness were studied. The transition from ductile to brittle behaviour was found to be at a strain rate between 10 - 4 and 10 - 3 s- 1 for the snow types and temperatures tested. Stiffness up to peak stress proved to be highly temperature dependent. Tough-ness is also significantly temperature dependent, while snow strength seems to depend only slightly on temperature. The dependence of the shear strength on temperature seems partly hidden by the scatter in strength data due to variations inherent in sampling and testing...|$|E

40|$|Pressurized {{fluidization}} is {{a promising}} new {{technology for the}} clean and efficient combustion of coal.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Natural dry-snow slab {{avalanches}} {{start with}} a failure within a weak snow layer. In {{order to understand the}} mechanical behaviour and the failure mechanism, we performed loading experi-ments with homogeneous and layered snow samples under controlled conditions in a <b>cold</b> <b>laboratory.</b> For simulating loading conditions similar to the natural snow pack, we designed and built an apparatus where a snow sample can be tilted by a ‘slope angle ’ and is loaded via the gravitational force. The deformation within the snow sample was measured optically with a pattern recognition algorithm. Shortly before macroscopic failure (breaking of the whole sample) we observed a concentration of deformation (softening) within the weak layer. Additionally, we measure acoustic emissions during the shear experiments to quantify the microscopic failure (breaking of bonds) in the snow sample before the complete failure. Our results support the assumption that the dominating mechanisms for snow deformation are the competing processes of breaking and sintering of bonds between grains...|$|E

Results revealed that capillary barriers and preferential flow are relevant processes ruling the speed of water infiltration in stratified snow.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to find a}} method for {{translation}} of heat transfer data from <b>cold</b> <b>laboratory</b> units to boiler conditions. From a compilation of existing data on heat transfer to walls in hot and cold circulating fluidized beds it is concluded that the results can be translated approximately by compensating for changes in the thermal conductivity of the gas and thermal radiation. A more general methodology is developed by deriving the criteria for thermal similarity. The only criterion that was added to those for fluid-dynamic similarity was the ratio of heat capacity of gas and particles. The thermal scaling is tested by comparing heat transfer measurements in a boiler with measurements in a scaled laboratory model. The results show that the Nusselt numbers were not the same in the boiler and the scaled model, which can be a result of the characteristic length-scale chosen, a too low heat capacity of the scaled particles or a failure to scale the local fluid-dynamics at the wall...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We present {{high speed}} video images of slab {{fracture}} experiments.

Over the course of four days, the bending and resulting tensile fracture of 66 samples were captured by a high speed camera at rates of 1000 and 1900 frames per second. The purpose of capturing the tests on video was to observe {{the size of the}} fracture process zone and to calculate the speed of crack propagation. Slab samples were seeded with tracer particles for image analysis calculations, with the resulting pixel resolution in the sub-millimeter range. The samples were back-lit to illuminate the propagation of the crack. Dry slabs of differing density, hardness, crystal form and size, and temperature were sampled. Slabs of the same composition but different size were tested to investigate the size effect. The peak strength, stiffness, and shape of the loading curve were found to be very sensitive to the loading rate...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Ice crystal {{orientation}} fabric {{data from}} ice cores contain important {{information concerning the}} internal structure and the flow behaviour of ice sheets. When ice cores are recovered from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, crystal orientation measurements are performed immediately to obtain fundamental physical property information. In the past, we have measured the c-axis orientation of ice crystals by a manual optical method using a universal stage. This method is very time-consuming, involving tedious work in a <b>cold</b> <b>laboratory.</b> Recently, automated systems have been developed that enable measurement of c-axis orientation, grain size and other microstructures. However, in order to detect the full crystal orientation of an ice crystal, we also need information on its a-axis orientation. A variety of other crystal orientation measurement methods have previously been discussed, but some shortcomings for ice-core studies cannot be neglected. We have developed a crystal-orientation analysing device using the Laue X-ray diffraction method. As this device can measure the orientations of all crystal axes with high accuracy, {{it is possible to}} obtain new microstructure information on natural ice crystals. For the first time, we are able to quantify very low subgrain misorientation angles in polar ice-core samples, allowing us to investigate micro-deformation features of individual crystals. Here we discuss the analysis process, which is customized to measure standard ice thin sections, and show preliminary results...|$|E
