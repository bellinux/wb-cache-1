Four treatments were tested and we followed the steps of saline wash, drain, immersion in saline solution containing lactic acid for pH adjustment (4. 3 to 4. 5), salt addition (1. 5 or 3 %), traditional pasteurization or fast heat treatment, cooling and storage (0 to 4 °C). The products were subjected to the physical, chemical, microbiological and sensory analyses and showed stability and safety for consumption up to 180 days in storage under refrigeration (0 to 4 °C). Consumers showed preference for product containing 1. 5 % NaCl and subjected to fast heat treatment. The results suggest that caviar substitute developed with rainbow trout roes presents potential to production. ...|$|R

50|$|There {{are a few}} {{reasons as}} to why exactly this species is declining. To begin with, they are being {{severely}} overfished. Ever since the 1900s, they have been poached at an alarming rate. After World War II, in 1948, 61 metric tons of Kaluga was caught, an unbelievable number for a species of their size (Krikhtin et al. 1997). They are extremely vulnerable to extinction by poaching because they have late sexual maturity. On average their sexual maturity lasts from 6 to 25 years of age. <b>Sturgeon</b> <b>Caviar</b> output, including the Kaluga, from 1957 to 2005, averaged about 117 tons per year. The animals are being hunted down for their unfertilized eggs, because <b>sturgeon</b> <b>roe</b> is considered a delicacy to people all across the world (Yang et al. 2006). This market cuts down on Kaluga population and only hastens the process of their extinction. Another reason for the endangerment is river pollution, especially near spawning grounds. This has led to deformed eggs, and has caused defects in birth.|$|R

The <b>sturgeon</b> yield <b>roe</b> (eggs) that are processed into caviar. Overfishing has depleted {{a number of the}} historic fisheries. In recent years, overfishing has threatened the sturgeon population to the point that environmentalists advocate banning sturgeon fishing completely until the population recovers. The high price of <b>sturgeon</b> <b>caviar,</b> however, allows fishermen to afford bribes to ensure the authorities look the other way, making regulations in many locations ineffective. Caviar harvesting further endangers the fish stocks, since it targets reproductive females.|$|R
