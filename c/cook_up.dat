Born in Ohio, he had multiple aliases {{and spoke with}} an affected cockney accent. He had worked as Taylor's valet and <b>cook</b> <b>up</b> until seven months before the murder.

Following the murder, Sands was never heard from again.|$|E
25|$|The seafood safari episode {{saw many}} firsts for the Great BBQ Challenge. The first dessert to be cooked {{entirely on the}} BBQ, the first entree and the first tears of the series. Restaurateur Fenton shocked the judges with his {{signature}} dish, the great Aussie pavlova with boozy summer fruits. Darwin cook Lisette served up antipasto and Perth IT professional Laz had all the right flavours with his stir fry vegetables and lamb chops. During the screen test Fenton's explosive nature impressed Mark and Julia while Laz came out on top with his clear delivery and knowledge base. The final challenge was to <b>cook</b> <b>up</b> a seafood feast. Laz's cook in the bag technique came under criticism from Ben as he didn't clean the flat plate between courses and mixed his meal with the charred remains of the previous dish. Fenton's Moreton Bay bugs prepared with Asian flavours, secured the win from the judges and moved him to tears and into the semi finals.|$|E

500|$|Many of Cibber's plays, listed below, were hastily cobbled {{together}} from borrowings. Alexander Pope said Cibber's drastic adaptations and patchwork plays {{were stolen from}} [...] "crucified Molière" [...] and [...] "hapless Shakespeare". The Double Gallant (1707) was constructed from Burnaby's The Reformed Wife and The Lady's Visiting Day, and Centlivre's Love at a Venture. In the words of Leonard R. N. Ashley, Cibber took [...] "what he could use from these old failures" [...] to <b>cook</b> <b>up</b> [...] "a palatable hash out of unpromising leftovers". The Comical Lovers (1707) was based on Dryden's Marriage à la Mode. The Rival Fools (1709) was based on Fletcher's Wit at Several Weapons. He rewrote Corneille's Le Cid with a happy ending as Ximena in 1712. The Provoked Husband (1728) was an unfinished fragment by John Vanbrugh that Cibber reworked and completed to great commercial success.|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four, {{calling it a}} disappointment. Vitaris heavily criticized Mulder's line: [...] "I'm not a psychologist"—reportedly an ad lib from Duchovny himself—noting that it {{undermines}} established continuity within the series including the character's background in psychology. Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, praises the installment, saying, [...] "Place a devil in the plot and I'll follow you {{to see what you}} can <b>cook</b> <b>up....</b> I enjoyed this tale of a devil looking to be just a normal dad immensely." [...] In his view the episode showed a return to the earlier horror-based narratives the series was known for; though he praises the casting of Campbell, he writes that moments between Mulder and Scully are lacking.|$|E

2500|$|Grandmaster Larry Evans {{wrote that}} Adams' [...] "tournament results were damaged by his dogmatism. Playing under the self-inflicted {{handicap}} of arming his opponents with advance {{knowledge of his}} 'best' lines, he felt honor-bound to steer straight into them even though his adversary invariably had a <b>cook</b> <b>up</b> his sleeve. By the time Weaver found a refutation and published it, another player found a different cook and so on ad infinitum." [...] According to Chess Review, this phenomenon may explain Adams' poor result at Hastings 1950–51.|$|E
