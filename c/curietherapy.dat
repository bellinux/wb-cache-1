40|$|Aim: Study the {{curative}} {{treatments for}} prostate cancer administered in the Centre region for a comparison of professional practices with professional references. Methods: Descriptive study of patients under the general scheme for whomthere was a request in 1998 for full reimbursement of theirmedical expenses paid {{for prostate cancer}} and a curative treatment (radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy or <b>curietherapy)</b> performed in the Centre region (France). Results: The study included 232 patients. The decision to administer a curative treatment was made for 19. 8 % of these patients although the life expectancy was less than ten years. The same decision was made for 23 patients for whom an element of presumption of the unconfined character of the cancer was indicated. In the extended report, ilio-obturator lymphadenectomy was not practised on 62 patients when {{it would have been}} indicated according to the reference standards. The same applies to tomodensitometry on 20 patients and bone scintigraphy on ten patients. A radical prostatectomy was performed on 118 patients and 114 have received radiotherapy treatment. Of the 109 patients operated who had been identified at the biopsy as at stages T 1 /T 2 /No/Nx, 45 % were actually at stages pT 3. The boundaries were invaded upon examination of the sample in 25 of the 118 patients operated on. The percentage of patients presenting urinary incontinence tended to fall among patients who were operated on, whereas the opposite was true for patients receiving radiotherapy treatment. Conclusion: This study confirmed that the consequences of curative treatments should not be underestimated...|$|E
