The late Silas Wright, {{in a letter to the}} Chicago convention, contributed his, which was worth something; and I now contribute mine, which may be worth nothing. At all events, it will mislead nobody, and therefore will do no harm. I would not borrow money. I am against an overwhelming, <b>crushing</b> <b>system.</b> Suppose that, at each session, Congress shall first determine how much money can, for that year, be spared for improvements; then apportion that sum to the most important objects. So far all is easy; but how shall we determine which are the most important? On this question comes the collision of interests. I shall be slow to acknowledge that your harbor or your river is more important than mine, and vice versa. To clear this difficulty, let us have that same statistical information which the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Vinton] suggested at the beginning of this session. In that information we shall have a stern, unbending basis of facts--a basis in no wise subject to whim, caprice, or local interest. The prelimited amount of means will save us from doing too much, and the statistics will save us from doing what we do in wrong places. Adopt and adhere to this course, and, it seems to me, the difficulty is cleared.|$|E

One way of processing rubbish is by machine. Producing machine for rubbish commonly is crushing machine or pressing machine. The purpose of this thesis is to design pressing machine for organic rubbish by capacity 250 kg/hours. This design is based on the integrated concept of cutting system from pressing result. <b>Crushing</b> <b>system</b> is designed by using knives arrangement that is rotated in its axes. The pressing process is designed by using shaft wheel mechanism and pressing plate that is equipped by spring. While, cutting system by using 2 blades is positioned rotating in axes end. The design is initiated by calculation of machine capacity and is continued by calculation of driving force of electrical motor. Then, there is needed calculation of design machines components needed; they are knives, axes, pulley and belt, cone gearwheel, axis, shaft and crank mechanism. Besides, there is also needed supporting system planning contains knives seizer, crushing cylinder wall, frame and machine cover and pelat mechanism and spring. The result of design is machine that consists of 3 systems; they are <b>crushing</b> <b>system,</b> pressing system and cutting system. This machine needs driving force of electric motor by 2, 5 HP (1, 84 kW). <b>Crushing</b> <b>system</b> by using 7 movements of cutting knife in the axis by speed of rotation 300 rpm. Pressing system is using mechanism of shaft wheel boost pressing piston. Shaft movement has speed rotation of 60 rpm, it means there is 60 times rotation in a minute.

In this paper, {{we describe the}} <b>Crusher</b> <b>system’s</b> three-pronged approach for safely and reliably moving between widely-spaced waypoints.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an investigation on the utilisation of carbon fibre composite elements designed into a <b>crushing</b> <b>system</b> {{with the aim}} of improving energy absorption for crashworthy structures. An experimental evaluation of the crushing behaviour of pressurised composite tubes is presented, with the intent to develop a variable load energy absorbing system in which, the crushing force can be controlled through the radius size of trigger mechanism and the use of pressurised composite tubes. The influence of plug triggering radius on the energy absorption characteristics was determined from using different trigger radii from 0 mm (sharp corner) to 6 mm. Internal pressurisation is presented as a method to vary the crushing force of the tubes. A novel sealing-crushing system was demonstrated to achieve a simultaneously crushing and maintaining constant internal pressure under dynamic impact condition. Experiments were carried out for the composite tubes crushed axially at 9 bar and 18 bar internal pressure levels. The experimental program included quasi-static testing carried out at UNSW in Australia and dynamic testing at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) in Stuttgart, Germany. For dynamic testing, a new generation of <b>crushing</b> <b>system</b> was developed and tested. The contribution of the force due to the internal pressure was significant to the crushing force of the tubes. It was improved by a proportion of the unpressurised crushing force (up to 60 % in one case). Internal pressurisation of composite tubes has been presented as a method for achieving an ideal variable load energy absorber. Explicit finite element study was also carried to simulate the experiment. The finite element analysis contributed {{to the understanding of the}} experimental results as well as providing a predictive tool to minimise the need for further testing. This investigation included the application of a stacked-shell finite element modelling methodology incorporating detailed information about trigger chamfer, different friction zones between a composite tube and crushing tool. Based on the extensive experimental work and FE simulation, this thesis has demonstrated the potential for an adaptable composite crushing element under a range of impact energy scenarios as a proposed variable load energy absorber for realistic crash conditions...|$|E

High {{manganese steel}} shows superior wear resistance when used under primary <b>crushing</b> <b>system</b> than when used under secondary and tertiary modes of crushing.

In this paper, we describe an end-to-end stereo computation co-processing system optimized for fast throughput that has been implemented on a single Virtex 4 LX 160 FPGA. This system is capable of operating on images from a 1024 x 768 3 CCD (true RGB) camera pair at 15 Hz. Data enters the FPGA directly from the cameras via Camera Link and is rectified, pre-filtered and converted into a disparity image all within the FPGA, incurring no CPU load. Once complete, a rectified image and the final disparity image are read out over the PCI bus, for a bandwidth cost of 68 MB/sec.

According to the previous results, in this paper the study has been extended to power consumption aspects related to the main quality features of the extracted olive oil, restricting the analysis only to the hammer crushing (Coratina cultivar), which represents the worst case. In particular, {{the effect of the}} olives delivery on the power consumption and quality of the extracted oil has been studied. The experimental trials, carried out on a laboratory plant during the 1993 - 94 and 1994 - 95 olive-oil seasons, show that, even though the diagram of power consumption has a parabolic increasing trend, the specific power decreases with the olives delivery. Anyway, studying the olives hammer crushing process also from the qualitative point of view (polyphenols number, acidity, peroxide number and induction time), it is possible to define an optimal range of olives delivery values. This optimal range (140 kg/h- 240 kg/h for the studied hammer crusher) represents the better working solution from both {{the point of view of}} the power consumption and the quality of the extracted oil.
