40|$|Injection-dependent {{minority}} carrier lifetime measurements are a valuable characterisation method for semiconductor materials, particularly those for photovoltaic applications. For a sample containing defects which obey Shockley-Read-Hall statistics, {{it is possible}} to use such measurements to determine (i) the location of energy levels within the band-gap and (ii) the ratios of the capture coefficients for electrons and holes. In this paper, we discuss a convenient methodology for determining these parameters from lifetime data. Minority carrier lifetime is expressed as a linear function of the ratio of the total electron concentration to the total hole concentration for p-type (or vice versa for n-type) material. When this is plotted on linear scales, a single-level Shockley-Read-Hall centre manifests itself as a straight line. The gradient and intercepts of such a plot can be used to determine recombination parameters. The formulation is particularly instructive when multiple states are recombination-active in a sample. To illustrate this, we consider oxide precipitates in silicon as a case study and analyse lifetime data {{for a wide variety of}} p-type and n-type samples as a function of temperature. We fit the data using both a single two-level defect and two independent single-level defects and find the latter can fit the lifetime curves in all cases studied.
