5|$|In some projects, use of rodenticides for {{biological}} pest control {{was replaced by}} the installation of nest boxes. It has been shown that the use of nest boxes is less <b>costly</b> <b>than</b> traditional control with rodenticides.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, the 747X {{family was}} unable to garner enough {{interest}} to justify production, and it was shelved along with the 767-400ERX in March 2001, when Boeing announced the Sonic Cruiser concept. Though the 747X design was less <b>costly</b> <b>than</b> the 747-500X and -600X, it was criticized for not offering a sufficient advance from the existing 747-400. The 747X {{did not make it}} beyond the drawing board, but the 747-400X being developed concurrently moved into production to become the 747-400ER.|$|E
5|$|England experimented {{briefly with}} milled coinage, but it wasn't until Peter Blondeau brought his method of minting coins {{there in the}} mid-seventeenth century that such coinage began in earnest in that country. Blondeau also invented a {{different}} method of marking the edge, which was, according to him, faster and less <b>costly</b> <b>than</b> the method pioneered by Olivier. Though Blondeau's exact method was secretive, numismatists have asserted that it likely resembled the later device invented by Jean Castaing. Castaing's machine marked the edges by means of two steel rulers, which, when a coinage blank was forced between them, imprinted legends or designs on its edge. Castaing's device found favour in France, and it was eventually adopted in other nations, including Britain and the United States, but it was eventually phased out by mechanised minting techniques.|$|E
50|$|As the {{complexity}} of these chips increases, the cost also increases. These processors are relatively <b>costlier</b> <b>than</b> their counterparts without the prefetch input queue.|$|R
5000|$|Butterfly {{networks}} {{are more complex}} and <b>costlier</b> <b>than</b> other topologies like linear array, ring and 2-D mesh due to higher number of links required to sustain the network.|$|R

5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add {{lettering}} and decoration {{to the edge}} of a coin. Such lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping, which was a common problem resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a method of marking the edges with lettering which would make it possible to detect if metal had been shaved from the edge. This method involved using a collar, into which the metal flowed from the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more <b>costly</b> <b>than</b> later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{success of}} the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, {{and the other to}} determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more <b>costly</b> <b>than</b> any Earth-based telescope. The U.S. Congress questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, public spending cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project.|$|E
5|$|Winemakers {{can also}} control the {{influence}} of oak by using alternatives to the standard barrique barrels. Larger barrels have a smaller wood-to-wine ratio and therefore less pronounced oak flavors. Winemakers in Italy and Portugal sometimes use barrels made from other wood types such as chestnut and redwood. Another method that winemakers consider is tea bagging with oak chips or adding oak planks to the wines while fermenting or aging it in stainless steel tanks. While these methods are less <b>costly</b> <b>than</b> oak barrels, they create more pronounced oak flavors, which tend not to mellow or integrate {{with the rest of}} the wine's components; nor do they provide the gradual oxidation benefit of barrel aging.|$|E
50|$|Afghanistan also borders Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan, so {{alternate}} supply routes, {{termed the}} Northern Distribution Network, exist to move supplies into Afghanistan through these countries. However, these routes are longer and <b>costlier</b> <b>than</b> the routes through Pakistan.|$|R
5000|$|Doodh patti chai (...) is a tea {{beverage}} {{consumed in}} Nepal, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, in which milk, together with sugar, is boiled with tea. This milk-based tea {{is quite common}} in the Indian Subcontinent. It is marginally <b>costlier</b> <b>than</b> regular, water-based tea.|$|R
50|$|Tungsten carbide is {{also used}} for making {{surgical}} instruments meant for open surgery (scissors, forceps, hemostats, blade-handles, etc.) and laparoscopic surgery (graspers, scissors/cutter, needle holder, cautery, etc.). They are much <b>costlier</b> <b>than</b> their stainless-steel counterparts and require delicate handling, but give better performance.|$|R
5|$|Following his {{swearing}} in as Lord Protector in 1653, Oliver Cromwell {{became a}} proponent of Blondeau's coinage method, which had yet to find favour in the nation's minting establishment. In 1654, Cromwell's government placed Blondeau {{in charge of a}} planned mint in Ireland, where the coinage was heavily debased by fraudulent means. The proposed mint never came into existence, but in 1656, Blondeau was given official appointment to strike £2,000 worth of coins bearing Cromwell's portrait with captured Spanish silver. The former Royal Mint superintendent, William John Hocking, believed that the edge lettering on Blondeau's coinage was created by means of a perforated steel strip, through which the coin's metal flowed during striking, creating the raised designs and wording. Hocking suggested that this technique would have been less <b>costly</b> <b>than</b> the older method involving the split collar, because the steel strip could be replaced more economically. However, the numismatist Peter B. Gaspar determined that Blondeau's Cromwell-era coinage was struck without a collar, which suggests that he used a machine to impart the edge lettering prior to striking.|$|E
5|$|The Palais Rohan {{remained}} the hôtel de ville until 1805. That year, the municipality {{presented it to}} Napoleon, who returned the Hôtel deHanau in exchange. Like the palace, the hôtel had been state-owned since the Revolution. The 1805 arrangement proved favourable for the municipality: {{the maintenance of the}} Hôtel deHanau was less <b>costly</b> <b>than</b> that of the larger Palais Rohan. It pleased Napoleon, for whom the palace was the more conspicuous display of grandeur. As for the palace, imperial ownership meant renewed splendour. The present to Napoleon was officially accepted by decree on 21January 1806; the interiors were then refurbished by the architect Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine. In the years before the Franco-Prussian War and the return of Alsace to Germany, the Palais Rohan was the property of the French state, which was in turn an empire, a kingdom, a monarchy, a republic, and again an empire.|$|E
5|$|Three {{hypotheses}} might {{account for}} consistent foraging specializations across individuals: food source variation, phenotypic differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when the use of two skills is more <b>costly</b> <b>than</b> specialist foraging. The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ {{in their ability to}} use each foraging skill and stably specialize on the most profitable one. The pattern of specialization is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given skill depends on the phenotypic composition of the flock. The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on the most profitable skill, but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each skill when initially given two equally profitable alternatives. At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern of specialization. Individuals in flocks adjusted their use of the two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different skill resulting in a variant of both the food source variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|Combination therapy {{may seem}} <b>costlier</b> <b>than</b> {{monotherapy}} {{in the short}} term, but when used appropriately, it causes significant savings: lower treatment failure rate, lower case-fatality ratios, fewer side-effects than monotherapy, slower development of resistance and consequently, less money needed {{for the development of}} new drugs.|$|R
5000|$|Troq Chai (...) , {{also known}} as Chitrali Chai, is a {{preparation}} of tea drunk in Pakistan in which salt, together with lemon, is boiled with the tea. This tea is common in Chitral, and Kalash valleys of Pakistan. It is <b>costlier</b> <b>than</b> regular tea, which is water-based.|$|R
50|$|I {{wanted to}} show NTR in a new look. We did a photo shoot and bought costumes from places {{around to make sure}} that each costume is not <b>costlier</b> <b>than</b> 1500 rupees. Deepa {{designed}} the costumes of NTR. We had all costumes ready even before the movie is started.|$|R

50|$|Expansion {{continued}} with {{the launch of}} the Junior-Lion (ஜூனியர் லயன்), Mini-Lion (மினி லயன்) and Thigil comics (திகில் காமிக்ஸ்), all of which were published in parallel, on a monthly basis. Festivals like Diwali, Pongal and summer holidays promised special Digest Issues, which were bigger and <b>costlier</b> <b>than</b> the regular comic. These were the Golden years in Tamil Comics history.|$|R
50|$|Similar floods {{occurred}} in November 1979 Louisiana flood and November 7-8, 1989 Louisiana flood, although the May 1995 event was more extensive and <b>costlier</b> <b>than</b> both combined. It {{was the worst}} flooding the city had experienced between hurricanes Betsy in 1965 and Katrina in 2005. There has been no comparable recorded flood in New Orleans caused by rain alone.|$|R
25|$|The International Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), {{adopted by}} the IMO, has {{mandated}} that marine vessels shall not consume fuel (bunker fuel, diesel, etc) with a sulphur content greater than 0.1% from the year 2020. Replacement of high sulphur bunker fuel with sulphur free LNG is required on major scale in marine transport sector as low sulphur liquid fuels are <b>costlier</b> <b>than</b> LNG.|$|R

25|$|In 2013, The Seattle Times {{reported}} that global coffee prices dropped more than 50 percent year-over-year. In Thailand, black ivory coffee beans are fed to elephants whose digestive enzymes reduce the bitter taste of beans collected from dung.

25|$|Speed {{cushions}} {{are often}} less <b>costly</b> <b>than</b> speed humps or tables, and most cities report {{them to be}} just as effective. In some jurisdictions, narrower speed cushions are placed at more frequent intervals to allow ambulances to pass while driving over the centre line. Large trucks (e.g. UPS, FedEx) are also not slowed down.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamp {{fixtures}} {{are more}} <b>costly</b> <b>than</b> incandescent lamps because they require a ballast {{to regulate the}} current through the lamp, but the lower energy cost typically offsets the higher initial cost. Compact fluorescent lamps are now available in the same popular sizes as incandescents and are used as an energy-saving alternative in homes.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, a University of Connecticut study {{indicated}} that {{five of the six}} states rank 43rd or lower for manufacturing costs, meaning that manufacturing in New England is generally <b>costlier</b> <b>than</b> {{in other parts of the}} U.S. Only Maine was less costly. Vermont, Rhode Island and New Hampshire tied for last place. Historic manufacturing cities like Lowell, Massachusetts have attempted to reuse mill buildings for residential and commercial purposes.|$|R
50|$|Although {{this system}} is <b>costlier</b> <b>than</b> {{alternative}} methods, it provides greater flexibility in carrier operations, since it imposes less onerous design elements on fixed wing aircraft than alternative methods of launch and recovery such as STOVL or STOBAR, allowing for a greater payload for more ordinance and/or fuel. CATOBAR can launch aircraft that lack a high thrust to weight ratio, including heavier non-fighter aircraft such as the E-2 Hawkeye and Grumman C-2 Greyhound.|$|R
30|$|This {{brings us}} to the overall {{comparison}} of the objective function: the cost. Our approach is to calculate this cost function separately for each time value in the future. This makes it behave very different from the conventional static picture of cost sensitive learning — e.g. an error in the immediate time frame is now <b>costlier</b> <b>than</b> that same error occurring at a future time.
