5000|$|Several {{perceived}} failings in the Madras Public Libraries Act {{have been}} addressed in subsequent Acts elsewhere. For example, the Hyderabad legislation, which later became the Andhra Pradesh Public Libraries Act, states {{that there should be}} a completely separate department of government to administer the libraries; that the head of the State Library Committee (in this case called the State Library Council) should be elected rather than defaulting to the portfolio of the current Education Minister; and that all local administrative areas should have their own library authority. Furthermore, the amount and extent of the cess collected was improved by extending the range of taxes upon which the surcharge was levied; and the government, through the State Library Council, has a duty to train the librarians. A key strategy which was embodied in the Act was the formulation of a hierarchical system whereby the local libraries were connected to the District libraries and they, in turn, were connected to the State Central Library and the National Library. <b>Centralised</b> <b>acquisition</b> and resource sharing was envisaged. This strategy had formed a part of the Second Five Year Plan but it appears not to have been enforced with any haste; Brahmanda Barua wrote in 1992 that throughout India [...] "The network principle has nowhere been applied in organising the libraries." ...|$|E

The ENCR-JRC project "Incidence and Mortality in Europe" ([URL] index. php/activities/encr-jrc-project) is finalised to create a standardised and comparable database for monitoring cancer incidence and mortality and provide regular information on the burden of cancer in Europe. The description, format, type of files and variables of the call are detailed in the submission guidelines, available both in the ENCR-JRC portal ([URL] and in the ENCR website at the following address: [URL] The reliability and utility of the in¬formation provided by cancer registries depends {{on the quality of}} the data collected; to this purpose, the ENCR, in cooperation with the JRC, set up a Working Group involving the main stakeholders in cancer data domain in order to establish a comprehensive and standardised list of data quality checks to be adopted by European cancer registries and European projects. The outcome of the Working Group was a proposal on one common procedure for data quality checks among the European cancer registries, reaching final agreements on case definition, variables to be collected and their format, and internal consistency rules; the final outcome of the project was an ENCR-endorsed recommendations document to serve as guidelines during the data acquisition procedure. Moreover, in order to enable cancer registries to perform data quality checks on their own and test the adherence of their data to the format required by the ENCR-JRC call for data, the JRC has developed a software respecting the rules codified in the above-mentioned guidelines. This software represents a first step in the process of providing cancer registries with a user friendly data-checking and quality control tool, and aims to standardize the procedures to be followed by European cancer registries when submitting data in order to improve their quality and comparability. The present version of the JRC – ENCR cancer registries data quality check software includes •	checks on the data files format (for incidence, mortality, lifetables and population) and on variables names and order according to the data call protocol •	verification of variables values •	cross checks among variables, internal consistency The software is distributed to cancer registries together with this manual.
