40|$|On {{the basis}} of studies {{conducted}} for the U. S. Air Force Aerospace Medical Research Laboratories (1, 2) specification of the dynamic response index or DRI, which {{is a measure of}} human spinal compression and rrobability of injury, has been adopted as a new criterion for d,. temining the acceptable tolerance level of humans to the personnel ejection environment. Prior to the adoption of the DRI the maximum acceleration and maximum time rate of change of acceleration were the primary determinants. The specification of the DRI is more realistic, however, in that it relates directly to stresses actually developed within the ejectee. This study was conducted to determine a more optimum ballistic cycle for the <b>catapult</b> <b>phase</b> of rocket catapult operation in terms of minimization of the DRI for a selected class of acceleration-time output. THE DYNAMIC RESPONSE INDEX The dynamic response index arose from an attempt to analyticaliy describe the effect of acceleration on an ejectee in terms of spinal compression, 4 (ft), and then relate this effect to the probability of injury. A plot of the operational injury rate vs DRI is shown in Figure 1 (3). Experimental studies have led to a second order differential equation relating spinal compression k to the longitudinally applied acceleration, A(t). This relation i...|$|E
