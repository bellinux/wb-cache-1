5|$|On 1 July 1905, the Met and the District both {{introduced}} electric {{units on}} the inner circle until later that day a Met multiple unit overturned the positive <b>current</b> <b>rail</b> on the District and the Met service was withdrawn. An incompatibility {{was found between the}} way the shoe-gear was mounted on Met trains and the District track and Met trains were withdrawn from the District and modified. Full electric service started on 24 September, reducing the travel time around the circle from 70 to 50 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{successful}} referendum held locally in 2003, METRO {{is currently in}} the beginning design phases of a 10-year expansion plan to add five more sections to connect to the <b>current</b> <b>rail</b> system. An 8.3mile (13.4km) expansion has been approved to run the service from the Uptown through Texas Southern University, ending at the University of Houston campus.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 1980s the 1940 {{rolling stock}} fleet was giving {{increasingly}} difficult service. The decision was taken to acquire new vehicles as an extension to a rolling stock acquisition programme on the Central line of London Transport (LT). This required implementation of fourth rail traction current system to maintain consistency with the LT fleet: a new aluminium centre <b>current</b> <b>rail</b> was provided. (The original steel positive rail was replaced by an aluminium one in 2008.) The new vehicles had passenger operated door opening buttons, which were unlikely to be required on the Waterloo & City line.|$|E

25|$|L13A/B - Created in 1974, this {{locomotive}} {{consisted of}} two 1938 Stock Driving Motor cars coupled back to back. Modifications included the addition of high level air pipes to allow coupling to other Departmental vehicles, reciprocating compressors, {{and the addition of}} power lines between the two cars. These gave the locomotive a very long shoegear span, since all four bogies were fitted with shoe beams, enabling it to cross gaps in the <b>current</b> <b>rail</b> at very low speeds. The locomotive was built so that L14A/B, which had proved the usefulness of a long shunting locomotive, could be scrapped.|$|E
25|$|The Trans-Hudson Express Tunnel or THE Tunnel, {{which later}} {{took on the}} name of the study itself, was meant to address the western, or Hudson River, crossing. Engineering studies {{determined}} that structural interferences made a new terminal connected to Grand Central or the current Penn Station unfeasible and its final design involved boring under the <b>current</b> <b>rail</b> yard to a new deep cavern terminal station under 34th Street. While Amtrak had acknowledged that the region represented a bottleneck in the national system and had originally planned to complete work by 2040, its timetable for beginning the project was advanced in part due to the cancellation of ARC, a project similar in scope, but with differences in design. That project, which did not include direct Amtrak participation, was cancelled in October 2010 by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who cited potential cost overruns. Amtrak briefly engaged the governor in attempt to revive the ARC Tunnel and use preliminary work done for it, but those negotiations soon broke down. Amtrak said it was not interested in purchasing any of the work. Senator Menendez later said some preparatory work done for ARC may be used for the new project. Costs for the project were $117 million for preliminary engineering, $126 million for final design, $15 million for construction and $178 million real estate property rights ($28 million in New Jersey and $150 million in New York City). Additionally, a $161 million partially refundable pre-payment of insurance premiums was also made.|$|E

50|$|A {{feature of}} PC Power and Cooling units {{is that their}} units use a lone, high-current +12 V rail for DC output {{to the rest of}} the system, as opposed to {{multiple}} lower <b>current</b> <b>rails</b> that run in parallel.This single-rail configuration is reminiscent of high-end power supplies in the early to mid 2000s, before an industry shift towards using split +12V rails for reliability, stability, and economical reasons.|$|R
500|$|Electric {{services}} {{began on}} 13 June 1905 between Hounslow and South Acton, using {{the line from}} Mill Hill Park to South Acton for a passenger service for the first time. Hounslow Town station was reopened, trains reversing at the station before continuing to Hounslow Barracks using a new single track curve. On 1 July 1905 electric trains began running from Ealing to Whitechapel, and {{on the same day}} the Metropolitan and District railways both introduced electric units on the inner circle. However, a Metropolitan multiple unit overturned the positive <b>current</b> <b>rail</b> on the District Railway, and investigation showed an incompatibility between the way the shoe-gear was mounted on the Met trains and the District Railway track, and the Met trains were withdrawn from the District lines. After modification the Met returned and electric trains took over on 24 September, reducing the travel time around the circle from seventy to fifty minutes. [...] By September, after withdrawing services over the unelectrified East London Line and the [...] east of East Ham, the District were running electric services on all remaining routes. From December 1905 the L service was hauled by electric locomotives from Mansion House to Earl's Court, where a L steam locomotive took over.|$|E

2500|$|Rail gauge {{in former}} Soviet {{territory}} {{differs from the}} gauge {{in the rest of}} the world. Rail tracks in the former Soviet territories are on a broad-gauge track of 1,524 millimeters (60 inches) versus the global standard gauge of 1,435 millimeters used in China, Europe, Iran, Turkey. [...] The Russian Empire and the Soviet Union intentionally used a different gauge (ostensibly to block invaders from entering Russia by rail). Consequently, trains on the <b>current</b> <b>rail</b> line from China to Kazakhstan must stop at the border, where cargo is unloaded and then reloaded onto trains on the broad-gauge rail line in Kazakhstan for transit through Central Asia.|$|E

50|$|The {{locomotives}} had a wheelbase of only 9 ft, {{and this}} was too short to operate the track circuits. Since this made their use impracticable, each was permanently coupled to a tender, which consisted of a bogie removed from a redundant District line Q Stock car. The weight of the bogie was increased to 17 tons, and it was fitted with tripcocks and sleet brushes, {{so that it could}} be used for clearing snow and ice from the <b>current</b> <b>rails.</b> Although the tenders were permanently coupled to the locomotives, they carried separate numbers, and were identified as DT81, DT82 and DT83. The tender increased the wheelbase to 28 ft.|$|R
50|$|The {{de-icing}} bogies carried ice-cutters, {{which were}} held against the <b>current</b> <b>rail</b> by a compressed air cylinder. Each had a rotating head with ridged steel rollers, {{to break up}} the ice. Sleet brushes with metal prongs were mounted either side of the cutter, so that the rail was swept before and after cutting, whichever way the locomotive was moving. Anti-freeze was applied to the rail by spray nozzles, supplied from a tank mounted in the central section, and accessible through a sliding door. Two operators were required, one to drive and the other to operate valves, so that when the <b>current</b> <b>rail</b> changed sides, the application of anti-freeze followed. In 1955, the process was upgraded, and the detection of the <b>current</b> <b>rail</b> was made automatic. When there was no rail, the sprays shut down, as they also did when the locomotive stopped.|$|E
