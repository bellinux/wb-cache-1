40|$|Increasing energy demand, {{coupled with}} the recent {{emphasis}} on domestic production, has resulted {{in an increase in}} natural gas exploration and pipeline construction in the central Appalachian region. Very {{little is known about the}} effects of natural gas pipeline construction on sediment production. The goals of this project were to measure erosion and examine the effects of vegetation and precipitation characteristics on erosion on a newly constructed pipeline in the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia. The study explored whether seed rate, slope class, or aspect, influenced erosion. The <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>pipeline</b> was buried beneath the surface on study hillslopes ranging from 30 - 68 % and beneath a less steep segment with slopes ranging from 18 - 26 %. A mixture of native herbaceous-plant seeds and straw mulch were applied following construction. Two different seeding rates were applied to compare vegetative recovery and to determine if increasing the seed rate would decrease erosion. A 1 -time seed rate, or the normal Forest Service application rate, and a 3 -time seed rate (1 -time + twice that rate) were tested. Two aspects (northwest-facing and southeast-facing) and four precipitation variables (30 -minute maximum intensity, duration, total rainfall amount, and time since last event) were defined. Sediment concentrations were compared for differences between two slopes, two seed rates, and two aspect classes. Precipitation variables were analyzed to identify those that could explain significant amounts of the variability in erosion from the pipeline. The 1 -time seed rate sections produced less sediment than the 3 -time seed rate sections, but this was probably more a function of subsurface flow differences associated with the sections seeded with the lighter rate and the water bar construction. Precipitation intensity explained the most variability in erosion. Study sites with gentler slopes produced less sediment than the steeper sections, as expected. As vegetation became established, sediment concentrations decreased for all study sections and reached low and relatively constant levels by approximately the end of August 2009...|$|E

40|$|Time, {{cost and}} quality are the prime {{objectives}} of any project. Unfortunately, today’s project management {{does not always}} ensure the realisation of these objectives. The main reasons of project non-achievement are changes in scope and design, changes in Government policies and regulations, unforeseen inflation, under-estimation and mis-estimation. An overall organisational approach with the application of appropriate management philosophies, tools and techniques can only solve the problem. The present study establishes a methodology for achieving success in implementing projects using a business process re-engineering (BPR) framework. Internal performance characteristics are introspected through condition diagnosis that identifies and prioritises areas of concern requiring attention. Process re-engineering emerges as a most critical area for immediate attention. Project process re-engineering is carried out by eliminating non-value added activities, taking up activities concurrently by applying information systems rigorously and applying risk management techniques throughout the project life cycle.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{data-driven}} approach in determining an optimal inspection interval for a petroleum pipeline system. The approach {{accounts for the}} determination of both the probability of failure and its associated consequences. The probability of failure is estimated by fitting the historical data of failure of the pipeline into either a homogenous Poisson process or non-homogenous Poisson process (power law). The analysis of historical data reveals the Poisoneous form that gives better description of the failure process. The consequences of failure are calculated {{in terms of economic}} loss, environmental damage and loss of human life. Both the failure probability and consequences are utilized to estimate the total loss of an operating pipeline system. A risk based integrity maintenance optimization of the pipeline is achieved by minimizing the economic loss, while taking the human risk and maintenance budget as constraints. The proposed framework is utilized in the maintenance planning of a very long <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> petroleum <b>pipeline</b> system. The outcomes are robust and well validated. The framework can be applied to any engineering system that requires inspection and maintenance planning. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
