6000|$|This is the generally-current belief. On this {{assumption}} the received geological classifications {{appear to be}} framed. The Silurian system, the Devonian system, the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>system,</b> etc., are set down in our books as groups of formations which everywhere succeed {{each other in a}} given order; and are severally everywhere of the same age. Though it may not be asserted that these successive systems are universal; yet it seems to be tacitly assumed that they are. In North and South America, in Asia, in Australia, sets of strata are assimilated to one or other of these groups; and their possession of certain mineral characters and a certain order of superposition are among the reasons assigned for so assimilating them. Though, probably, no competent geologist would contend that the European classification of strata is applicable to the globe as a whole; yet most, if not all geologists, write as though it were. Among readers of works on Geology, nine out of ten carry away the impression that the divisions, Primary, Secondary and Tertiary, are of absolute and uniform application; that these great divisions are separable into subdivisions, each of which is definitely distinguishable from the rest, and is everywhere recognizable by its characters as such or such; and that {{in all parts of the}} Earth, these minor systems severally began and ended at the same time. When they meet with the term [...] "Carboniferous era," [...] they take for granted that it was an era universally carboniferous--that it was, what Hugh Miller indeed actually describes it, an era when the Earth bore a vegetation far more luxuriant than it has since done; and were they in any of our colonies to meet with a coal-bed, they would conclude that, as a matter of course, it was of the same age as the English coal-beds.|$|E
6000|$|Up to 1839 it was inferred, {{from their}} {{crystalline}} character, that the metamorphic rocks of Anglesea were more ancient than any rocks of the adjacent main land; {{but it has}} since been shown that they are {{of the same age}} with the slates and grits of Carnarvon and Merioneth. Again, slaty cleavage having been first found only in the lowest rocks, was taken as an indication of the highest antiquity: whence resulted serious mistakes; for this mineral characteristic is now known to occur in the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>system.</b> Once more, certain red conglomerates and grits on the north-west coast of Scotland, long supposed from their lithological aspect to belong to the Old Red Sandstone, are now identified with the Lower Silurians. These are a few instances of the small trust to be placed in mineral qualities, as evidence of the ages or relative positions of strata. From the recently-published third edition of Siluria, may be culled numerous facts of like implication. Sir R. Murchison considers it ascertained, that the siliceous Stiper stones of Shropshire are the equivalents of the Tremadock slates of North Wales. Judged by their fossils, Bala slate and limestone are of the same age as the Caradoc sandstone, lying forty miles off. In Radnorshire, the formation classed as upper Llandovery rock, is described at different spots, as [...] "sandstone or conglomerate," [...] "impure limestone," [...] "hard coarse grits," [...] "siliceous grit"--a considerable variation for so small an area as that of a county. Certain sandy beds on the left bank of the Towy, which Sir R. Murchison had, in his Silurian System, classed as Caradoc sandstone (evidently from their mineral characters), he now finds, from their fossils, belong to the Llandeilo formation. Nevertheless, inferences from mineral characters are still habitually drawn and received. Though Siluria, in common with other geological works, supplies numerous proofs that rocks of the same age are often of widely-different composition a few miles off, while rocks of widely-different ages are often of similar composition; and though Sir R. Murchison shows us, as in the case just cited, that he has himself in past times been misled by trusting to lithological evidence; yet his reasoning all through Siluria, shows that he still thinks it natural to expect formations of the same age to be chemically similar, even in remote regions. For example, in treating of the Silurian rocks of South Scotland, he says:--"When traversing the tract between Dumfries and Moffat, in 1850, it occurred to me, that the dull reddish or purple sandstone and schist {{to the north of the}} former town, which so resembled the bottom rocks of Longmynd, Llanberis, and St. David's, would prove to be of the same age;" [...] and further on, he again insists upon the fact that these strata [...] "are absolutely of the same composition as the bottom rocks of the Silurian region." [...] On this unity of mineral character it is, that this Scottish formation is concluded to be contemporaneous with the lowest formations in Wales; for the scanty paleontological evidence suffices for neither proof nor disproof. Now, had there been a continuity of like strata in like order between Wales and Scotland, there might have been little to criticize in this conclusion. But since Sir R. Murchison himself admits, that in Westmoreland and Cumberland, some members of the system [...] "assume a lithological aspect different from what they maintain in the Silurian and Welsh region," [...] there seems no reason to expect mineralogical continuity in Scotland. Obviously, therefore, the assumption that these Scottish formations are of the same age with the Longmynd of Shropshire, implies the latent belief that certain mineral characters indicate certain eras. Far more striking instances, however, of the influence of this latent belief remain to be given. Not in such comparatively near districts as the Scottish lowlands only, does Sir R. Murchison expect a repetition of the Longmynd strata; but in the Rhenish provinces, certain [...] "quartzose flagstones and grits, like those of the Longmynd," [...] are seemingly concluded to be of contemporaneous origin, because of their likeness. [...] "Quartzites in roofing-slates with a greenish tinge that reminded us of the lower slates of Cumberland and Westmoreland," [...] are evidently suspected to be of the same age. In Russia, he remarks that the carboniferous limestones [...] "are overlaid along the western edge of the Ural chain by sandstones and grits, which occupy much the same place in the general series as the millstone grit of England;" [...] and in calling this group, as he does, the [...] "representative of the millstone grit," [...] Sir R. Murchison clearly shows that he thinks likeness of mineral composition some evidence of equivalence in time, even at that great distance. Nay, on the flanks of the Andes and in the United States, such similarities are looked for, and considered as significant of certain ages. Not that Sir R. Murchison contends theoretically for this relation between lithological character and date. For on the page from which we have just quoted (Siluria, p. 387), he says, that [...] "whilst the soft Lower Silurian clays and sands of St. Petersburg have their equivalents in the hard schists and quartz rocks with gold veins in the heart of the Ural mountains, the equally soft red and green Devonian marls of the Valdai Hills are represented on the western flank of that chain by hard, contorted, and fractured limestones." [...] But these, and other such admissions, seem to go for little. While himself asserting that the Potsdam-sandstone of North America, the Lingula-flags of England, and the alum-slates of Scandinavia are of the same period--while fully aware that among the Silurian formations of Wales, there are oolitic strata like those of secondary age; yet his reasoning is more or less coloured by the assumption, that formations of like qualities probably belong to the same era. Is it not manifest, then, that the exploded hypothesis of Werner continues to influence geological speculation? ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Neogene {{evolution}} of the Ene and southern Ucayali basins of the Subandes has been controlled by two stacked thrust wedges that differ in terms of tectonic styles. The lower thrust wedge is formed by deep-seated décollements within the basement related to thick-skinned foreland structures inherited from an Early <b>Carboniferous</b> thrust <b>system.</b> Seismic reflection data show that this Paleozoic compressional system has been eroded and unconformably covered by Late Carboniferous clastic sediments. It generated an irregular Paleozoic sedimentary architecture controlling the Neogene thrust propagation. The upper thin-skinned thrust wedge developed within this Paleozoic sedimentary series and constitutes the Subandean zone. Cross-section balancing shows an along-strike homogenous horizontal shortening of ~ 56 km (~ 30 %) across the Ene-southern Ucayali thrust system. This amount of shortening was vertically partitioned onto the two stacked thrust wedges. The N-S thickness variations of the Paleozoic sedimentary prism controlled the eastward propagation of the upper thrust wedge. The southern thickening of the Paleozoic series generated major décollements and the shortening excess is of 7 km (16 %) {{in comparison to the}} north. Consequently, the northern lack of shortening onto the upper thrust wedge was transferred to the Early Carboniferous compressional structures of the lower thrust wedge. We suggest that this vertical partitioning of the shortening was accommodated by a regional oblique ramp: the Tambo transfer zone.

Evidence is drawn from integrated analysis of over 50, 000 line kilometres of seismic data and well data, together with regional source rock screening, reservoir analysis and basin modelling. Visean-Namurian marine and non-marine mudstones and coal source rocks are interbedded within fluvial and marine reservoir sandstones within a stacked succession up to 5 km thick.

A variety of structural and stratigraphic traps are possible, including intraformational Carboniferous traps, with a regional seal at Permian (Zechstein) level. Synthesis of many previously unpublished datasets demonstrates the Visean–Namurian play south of the Mid North Sea High as part of an extensive petroleum system from the East Irish Sea, across onshore to offshore UK and into The Netherlands sector of the North Sea.

40|$|Fusain occurs {{widely in}} Carboniferous coals and sediments. It is now {{recognised}} to represent charcoal {{and be the}} product of wildfire. The occurrence of fire is partly constrained by atmospheric oxygen levels, availability and nature of fuel and by aspects of climate (rainfall and seasonability in particular). The majority of fires in the Carboniferous were probably started by lightning strikes or by volcanic activity. Experiments on the charring of modern plants {{has shown that the}} reflectance of charcoal (and hence fusain) is directly related to temperature of formation. Different fire types may yield fusain assemblages of differing reflectance spectrums, but it may be significant that many modern charcoal assemblages yield only semifusinites (as seen by reflectance microscopy). The significance of these findings is assessed in relation to the use of fusinites and semifusinites as depositional indicators, as interpreted from coal petrology. Fires may have a dramatic effect on ecosystems, not only causing changes in vegetational succession but also severe erosion can occur following a major fire which can be traced in depositional systems. In this paper we document three major <b>Carboniferous</b> sedimentary <b>systems</b> affected by fire: clastic sedimentary systems, using extensive fusain deposits in mid-Lower Carboniferous, near-shore sediments in Donegal, Ireland; volcanic systems using late Early Carboniferous, volcaniclastic sequences in the Midland Valley of Scotland; and coal and coal-bearing sequences in the Upper Carboniferous (Westphalian B) of the Pennine Basin, England.

The S 2 fabric is reworked by upright folds F 3 {{that are responsible for}} a major shortening of the whole accretionary system. For both the eclogite and blueschist, peak and retrograde P–T conditions have been thermodynamically constrained at 25 – 26 kbar and 425 – 500 °C and 10 – 13 kbar and 500 − 550 °C respectively, suggesting a shared exhumation history. The garnet-whole rock-amphibole isochron in the blueschist yielded Lu–Hf and Sm–Nd ages of 326. 0 ± 2. 9 Ma and 318. 4 ± 3. 9 Ma respectively, interpreted to date the prograde to peak metamorphic assemblage. The retrograde path of the eclogite is characterized by heterogeneous omphacite recrystallization into a mylonitic fine-grained matrix and crystallization of blue amphibole. Microstructures in both pristine porphyroclastic and recrystallized fine-grained domains in the eclogite indicate a gradual evolution from constriction-dominated (L>S-type) to flattening-dominated (S>L-type) type of deformation, increase of fabric intensity reflected by gradually growing M-indexes and the development of lattice preferred orientation (LPO) typical for dislocation creep under slightly hydrated conditions. Recrystallization of the matrix in the blueschist is homogeneous, which indicates a matrix dominated channel flow during exhumation. These LPOs evolutions suggest a significant mechanical coupling with the upper plate concomitant with oroclinal bending of the Kazakh orocline. Lock up of Kazakh orocline is responsible for further stress increase resulting in horizontal shortening of South Tianshan accretionary wedge and development of D 3 upright folding and steepening of the whole sequence...|$|R

40|$|Growth {{faulting}} is {{a common}} feature of many deltaic environments and is vital in determining local sediment dispersal and accumulation, and hence in controlling the resultant sedimentary facies distribution and architecture. Growth faults occur {{on a range of}} scales, from a few centimetres to hundreds of metres, with the largest growth faults frequently being under-represented in outcrops that are often smaller than the scale of feature under investigation. This paper presents data from the exceptionally large outcrops of the Cliffs of Moher, western Ireland, where a growth-fault complex affects strata up to 60 m in thickness and extends laterally for 3 km. Study of this Namurian (Upper <b>Carboniferous)</b> growth-fault <b>system</b> enables the relationship between growth faulting and sedimentation to be detailed and permits reconstruction of the kinematic history of faulting. Growth faulting was initiated with the onset of sandstone deposition on a succession of silty mudstones that overlie a thin, marine shale. The decollement horizon developed {{at the top of the}} marine shale contact for the first nine faults, by which time aggradation in the hangingwall exceeded 60 m in thickness. After this time, failure planes developed at higher stratigraphic levels and were associated with smaller scale faults. The fault complex shows a dominantly landward retrogressive movement, in which only one fault was largely active at any one time. There is no evidence of compressional features at the base of the growth faults, thus suggesting open-ended slides, and the faults display both disintegrative and non-disintegrative structure. Thin-bedded, distal mouth bar facies dominate the hangingwall stratigraphy and, in the final stages of growth-fault movement, erosion of the crests of rollover structures resulted in the highest strata being restricted to the proximity of the fault. These upper erosion surfaces on the fault scarp developed erosive chutes that were cut parallel to flow and are downlapped by the distal hangingwall strata of younger growth faults. ...|$|R

Ice Age Nebraska was subject to glacial activity and home to creatures like the giant bear Arctodus, horses, mammoths, mastodon, shovel-tusked proboscideans, and Saber-toothed cats. Local Native Americans devised mythical explanations for fossils like attributing them to water monsters killed by their enemies, the thunderbirds.

40|$|This paper {{integrates}} {{interpretations of}} modern long-offset seismic datasets with potential field anomalies derived from dense grids of 2 D gravity and magnetic data {{to present a}} regional-scale synthesis of Devonian, Carboniferous and Early Permian basin development beneath the UK Central North Sea. The 95 000 km 2 study area has had little modern exploration for petroleum systems beneath the Upper Permian. Seismic interpretation and potential field modelling confirm that along the southern fringe of the Central North Sea, as in northern England, Lower Carboniferous basin development was strongly influenced by the disposition of granite-cored Lower Palaeozoic basement blocks – Farne Block, Dogger Block and Devil's Hole High. This study adds a previously unidentified WNW–ESE trending pre-Devonian basement block, the Auk–Flora Ridge, that exerted a profound control on Late Devonian to Mesozoic structural evolution of the south-Central North Sea. From the Flora Field, where it is overlain by relatively thick mid-Devonian to earliest Permian strata, the sub-Permian relief of this block becomes progressively shallower towards the NW. On its southern flank lies a parallel half-graben, akin to the Stainmore Trough in northern England, and interpreted as also containing several thousand feet of Lower Carboniferous strata. As indicated by the coal measures section in well 39 / 7 - 1, these strata are likely to include prolific source rocks, which have been modelled as being fully mature for oil generation in Quadrant 29. Potential field modelling extends this interpretation beyond the current seismic coverage, and suggests that Carboniferous to earliest Permian basin development in the Central North Sea was strongly influenced by an underlying Scottish–Norwegian SW–NE trending Caledonoid structural fabric. An earliest Permian, Lower Rotliegend unit thickens southwards towards the Auk–Flora Ridge, and rests unconformably on one or more undrilled NE–SW trending Carboniferous basins. Red-bed fluvial facies akin to those at Flora are likely to dominate the substantial post-Dinantian fill of these basins, but significant thicknesses of Westphalian coal-measure source rocks may also be present locally. As in central Scotland, the Dinantian strata underlying a widespread mid-Carboniferous unconformity in these basins are likely to contain further coal-measure intervals and local developments of oil-shale source rocks. These Westphalian and Dinantian source rocks are key elements of a <b>Carboniferous</b> petroleum <b>system</b> that remains largely untested across {{large areas of the}} Central North Sea. ...|$|R

Study of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) digital data shows that maximum discrimination of different rocks is achieved in bands 5, 4, and 2 in red, green and blue, respectively. Maximum spectral contrast of Nisai limestone lithofacies uses band ratios 7 / 5 (R), 4 / 3 (G) and 3 / 2 (B). Laboratory spectral measurements suggest Nisai lithofacies are best discriminated in lower wavelength regions (TM bands 1, 2, 3, and 4). Late Paleocene to early Oligocene Nisai Formation records carbonate platform, slope and basinal deposition. Newly formed structural highs and lows, due to emplacement of ophiolites on the western passive margin of Indo-Pakistan subcontinent, controlled deposition and thickness of Nisai lithofacies. Revised age of the ophiolite emplacement, based on benthic forams, is early Paleocene. Siliciclastic Khojak Formation includes newly identified upper continental slope, prodelta, delta front, lower and upper delta plains lithofacies. These lithofacies represent prograding fluvial-dominated, wave-modified Katawaz delta that axially fed Khojak submarine-fan turbidites to the southwest. Sandstone detrital modes and paleocurrent analysis suggest derivation from the early Himalayan orogen and longitudinal dispersal down the basin axis. Decrease in quartz, and increase in total lithics from bottom to top reflect gradual uplift and unroofing of the early Himalaya. Diagenetic relationships suggest complex paragenetic sequence of chlorite-quartz-calcite cementation. Himalaya-derived molasse, delta, and turbidite fan sediments are related in time and space. Molasse sedimentation began in late Paleocene, when early Himalayan orogenic highlands formed. However, sedimentation on the modern Indus delta-fan {{began in the early}} Miocene. This age-range discrepancy implies that a major portion of the Himalayan marine record is missing. Khojak strata are that missing record.

The Paleozoic formations from the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian system {{are found in the}} Western Himalaya region in Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. The Mesozoic Deccan Traps formation is seen over most of the northern Deccan; they are believed {{to be the result of}} sub-aerial volcanic activity. The Trap soil is black in colour and conducive to agriculture. The <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>system,</b> Permian System and Triassic systems are seen in the western Himalayas. The Jurassic system is seen in the western Himalayas and Rajasthan.Tertiary imprints are seen in parts of Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and along the Himalayan belt. The Cretaceous system is seen in central India in the Vindhyas and part of the Indo-Gangetic plains. The Gondowana system is seen in the Narmada River area in the Vindhyas and Satpuras. The Eocene system is seen in the western Himalayas and Assam. Oligocene formations are seen in Kutch and Assam. The Pleistocene system is found over central India. The Andaman and Nicobar Island are thought to have been formed in this era by volcanoes. The Himalayas were formed by the convergence and deformation of the Indo-Australian and Eurasian Plates. Their continued convergence raises the height of the Himalayas by 1 cm each year.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{contribution}} to the redefinition of the base of <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>system.</b> At present the criterion for the definition of the Devonian–Carboniferous boundary is the first occurrence of a conodont species. In order to evaluate the stratigraphic potential for new criteria for the definition of the Devonian–Carboniferous boundary, the distribution of conodont species of Bispathodus, Branmehla, Palmatolepis, Polygnathus, Protognathodus, Pseudopolygnathus and Siphonodella across the boundary is presented and discussed. An updated biozonation scheme across the boundary based on the First Appearance of Bispathodus ac. aculeatus, Bispathodus costatus, Bispathodus ultimus, Protognathodus kockeli, Siphonodella bransoni and Siphonodella duplicata is proposed, and it is suggested that the new criterion for the definition of the base of the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>system</b> be the First Appearance Datum of Pr. kockeli or Si. bransoni...|$|E

Gas drilling {{is probably the}} only technology to overcome this problem. However, the applicability of gas drilling technology should be investigated first。It was studied by analyzing the rock strength both experimentally and theoretically. Stress status of many rock elements near well face was tested which showed a 2 D compression status rather than 3 D in conventional slurry drilling technology conditions. Therefore there was a horizontal stress for underground rocks, in a similar magnitude with upper burden pressure. The domination of the confining pressure, different with normal conditions, may mislead {{the selection of the}} failure criterion. We proved the correction of the Mohr-coulomb criterion as the most suitable failure criterion in gas drilling conditions. As a result, the applicability of gas drilling technology in <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>system</b> of Dzungaria basin was concluded...|$|E
