5|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>malformation</b> or {{underdevelopment}} (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is {{a characteristic}} of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In very rare cases, the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. Congenital brain malformations outside the cerebellum can, in turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in some forms of Arnold–Chiari malformation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>malformation,</b> {{hereditary}} disorders, {{and acquired}} conditions can affect cerebellar structure and, consequently, cerebellar function. Unless the causative condition is reversible, {{the only possible}} treatment is to help people live with their problems. Visualization of the fetal cerebellum by ultrasound scan at 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy {{can be used to}} screen for fetal neural tube defects with a sensitivity rate of up to 99%.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{relative}} importance of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> {{as a cause of}} death {{in the first year of}} life is increasing along with the control of preventable causes of perinatal mortality. Aim: To identify risk factors for <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations.</b> Patients and Methods: Retrospective case-control study of births registered in the database of The Latin American Collaborative Study of <b>Congenital</b> <b>Malformations</b> (ECLAMC), in the period 2001 - 2010. Results: Birth weight and gestational age were significantly lower in cases than controls, behaving as risk factors and associated with a greater severity of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations.</b> The risk and severity of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> increased along with mother&# 8217;s age. Fetal growth retardation, a history of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> in the family, physical factors and acute illnesses of the mother in the first trimester of pregnancy were also significant risk factors for <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> and their severity. The educational level of the mother was a protective factor for <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> and their severity. Conclusions: Variables previously identified as risk factors for <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations,</b> were significantly related with the occurrence of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> and their severity...|$|R

25|$|Infant {{mortality}} {{is the death}} of an infant {{in the first year of}} life, often expressed as the number of deaths per 1000 live births (infant mortality rate). Major causes of infant mortality include dehydration, infection, <b>congenital</b> <b>malformation</b> and SIDS.|$|E
25|$|Other common causes include trauma, {{autoimmune}} disease, {{high blood}} calcium, hypothermia, and {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP).

5000|$|A {{follow-up}} analysis for Ganirelix {{done by the}} Marketing Authorisation Holder compared the number of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> between individuals whose mothers were treated with Ganirelix compared with individuals whose mothers were treated with a GnRH agonist. The total number of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> was higher in the ganirelix group than in the GnRH agonist group (7.6% vs. 5.5%). [...] This falls within the range for the normal incidence of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations,</b> and current data do not suggest that Ganirelix increases the incidence of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> or anomalies. No important differences {{in the frequency of}} ectopic pregnancies and miscarriage were noted with the use of Ganirelix.|$|R
30|$|The main {{endpoint}} of {{this study}} was the presence of congenital defects in the newborn. Furthermore, intrauterine developmental defects were assessed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD)- 10 classification [29]. Specifically, the presence of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> of the genital organs, <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> of the urinary system, <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> and deformities of the musculoskeletal system and other <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> were evaluated [29]. The results obtained were compared against the national statistical data for Kiev during the same 5 -year period from primiparous pregnancies in women who had not used Canephron® N. The status of the newborn infant was evaluated using the 10 -point Apgar scoring system one minute after birth [30].|$|R

40|$|Background: Chronic {{pesticide}} {{exposure is}} a recognized risk for human health. The frequency of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> in exposed people, {{can be used}} for epidemiological studies assessing reproductive risk secondary to toxic exposure. Aim: To study the association between the incidence of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> and parent’s exposure to pesticides. Material and methods: A prospective study of cases and controls. The exposure could be caused by occupational activities or residence around fumigated crops. The records of cases and controls from the surveillance carried out in the Hospital Regional de Rancagua were analyzed. This hospital is active member of a collaborative study of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> in Latin America. Results: In two years there was a total of 453 newborns (18 stillborn) with <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations,</b> with an incidence of 41. 24 ‰. Considering only children born alive, the paired analysis of cases and controls showed an association of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> with a history of maternal exposure, with an attributable fraction of 54. 4 %. Conclusions: These results, showing an association between pesticide exposure and <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations,</b> should be analyzed in the future by a logistic regression test.

40|$|Background: In many countries, 1 to 3 % of newborn infants are {{conceived}} by assisted reproduc-tive techniques (ART). Despite {{the success of}} ART, there is concern {{about the risk of}} <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> among these infants. We report our experience to determine whether use of ART is associated with an increase in major <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> or adverse pregnancy outcomes. Materials and Methods: Historical cohort study of major <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> (MCM) was performed in 978 births from January 2008 to December 2010. The data for this analysis were derived from a Tehran’s ART linked data file by simple sampling method. In our study, the risk of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> was compared in 326 ART infants and 652 naturally conceived (NC) infants. We also performed multiple logistic regression analyses to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the independent association of ART on each outcome.

25|$|As {{with all}} {{chemotherapeutic}} agents, docetaxel administered to pregnant animals causes {{a variety of}} embryofetal toxicities, including death, when given {{during the period of}} organogenesis. Yet adequate studies investigating maternal and fetal effects in humans are lacking. One small systematic review that examined the use of taxanes to treat breast cancer in pregnancy showed that, out of 19 patients, only three congenital malformations occurred. Two cases of cerebral ventriculomegaly observed in the study were documented prior to the administration of chemotherapy, suggesting an alternate cause of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformation.</b> The third case involved pyloric stenosis in an infant whose mother received a combination regimen of docetaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel; because the fetus was exposed to multiple drugs in utero, it remains difficult to identify docetaxel as the causative teratogenic agent. Further studies are needed to better assess the safety of docetaxel in pregnancy and determine appropriate dosing in pregnant women.|$|E

30|$|Two {{studies on}} <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> in general have yielded contradicting results, with one study {{reporting}} {{a high rate}} of <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> after in utero exposure to lithium (Reis and Kallen 2008) and another study reporting no association between lithium exposure and <b>congenital</b> <b>malformations</b> (Jacobson et al. 1992). Additionally, several case reports have been published on congenital diaphragmatic hernia (Hosseini et al. 2010), goiter (Frassetto et al. 2002; Nars and Girard 1977), cardiovascular complications (Park et al. 1980; Long and Willis 1984; Arnon et al. 1981; Wilson et al. 1983), bilateral hip dislocation (Deiana et al. 2014) and neural-tube defect (Jacobson et al. 1992).

Reports of diaphragmatic herniation due to injury date back {{at least as far}} as the 17th century. [...] Petit was the first to establish the difference between acquired and [...] congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which results from a <b>congenital</b> <b>malformation</b> of the diaphragm.

2500|$|Hernias {{may also}} {{occur as a}} result of <b>{{congenital}}</b> <b>malformation,</b> a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. When the pleuroperitoneal membranes fail to fuse, the diaphragm does not act as an effective barrier between the abdomen and thorax. Herniation is usually of the left, and commonly through the posterior lumbocostal triangle, although rarely through the anterior foramen of Morgagni. The contents of the abdomen, including the intestines, may be present in the thorax, which may impact development of the growing lungs and lead to hypoplasia. This condition is present in 1 out of 2,000 births. [...] A large herniation has a mortality rate of three out of four, and requires immediate surgical repair.|$|E
