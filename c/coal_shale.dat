40|$|The {{low-temperature}} oxidation law of {{coal and}} rock mass {{is the basis}} to study spontaneous combustion in goafs. In this paper, the low-temperature oxidation laws of <b>coal,</b> oil <b>shale,</b> and mixtures of <b>coal</b> and oil <b>shale</b> were studied by using laboratory programmed heating experiments combined with a field beam tube monitoring system. The results from the programmed heating experiments showed that the heat released from oil shale was less than that from coal. Coal had a lower carbon monoxide (CO) -producing temperature than oil shale, and the mixture showed obvious inhibiting effects on CO production with an average CO concentration of about 38 % of that for coal. Index gases were selected in different stages to determine the critical turning point temperature for each stage. The field beam tube monitoring system showed that the temperature field of the 1105 co-mining face of <b>coal</b> and oil <b>shale</b> in the goaf of the Liangjia Coal Mine presented a ladder-like distribution, and CO concentration was the highest for coal and lower for the mixture of <b>coal</b> and oil <b>shale,</b> indicating that the mixture of <b>coal</b> with oil <b>shale</b> had an inhibiting effect on CO production, consistent with {{the results from the}} programmed heating experiments...|$|R

He secured a large number of contracts for lighting cities and towns all across the United States.|$|E

At the same time, some reckoned neat benzole was a little strong for the average engine and started to mix it with petrol. This led in 1922 to the replacement of benzole fuel with a [...] "fifty-fifty mixture" [...] of benzole and petroleum which addressed the supply issue and could be seen as an early example of customer responsiveness. Neat benzole continued to be marketed as an effective anti-knocking performance enhancing additive.|$|E

50|$|Military {{service in}} the First World War {{introduced}} many British men to motoring for the first time: returning survivors began, where funds permitted, to purchase small motor cars or motor bikes, while others set up in business to maintain and repair the motor cars of the wealthy. Before the war motor fuel suppliers in the UK had typically included pharmacies, cycle shops or even blacksmiths, but after the war commercial roadside garages began to appear, slowly at first. Because garages were initially sparse the Automobile Association itself set up twelve strategically located filling stations, supplying fuel only to its own members and making no profit from the transactions. Initially the AA fuel stations supplied only National Benzole which was seen a particularly patriotic fuel choice because the <b>coal</b> <b>shale</b> which was the principal ingredient of benzole was domestically produced. In 1927 the AA dismantled its small chain of service stations as {{the growth of a}} commercially motivated service station network rendered them unnecessary, but by this time National Benzole was a nationally established fuel brand in the UK.|$|E
50|$|Mineral {{resources}} include {{deposits of}} anthracite <b>coal,</b> <b>shale</b> and fireclay {{and have been}} exploited for several hundred years, the most significant of which (coalmining) having had {{a major impact on}} the development of the town. Up until the late 1960s, coal mining was the key economic activity in Castlecomer and the surrounding areas. Mining in Castlecomer began in the mid 17th Century with the extraction of iron ore. Huge areas of oak woodland were cleared to feed the smelting furnaces. coal deposits were found beneath the shale and these were to form the basis of the coal mining industry in the area which lasted for over 300 years. In the mid 17th century, Christopher Wandesforde, from Yorkshire was invited to Ireland by the Lord Lieutenant and granted a large estate in Castlecomer which included the Castlecomer coalfield. The Wandesforde family were responsible for the opening up of a number of coal seams (The Old Three Foot Seam, The Jarrow Seam and The Skehana Seam). The Leinster Coalfield is centred on Castlecomer and extends into counties Laois and Carlow. The coal seams were often quite narrow but the coal itself was very high-quality anthracite with a low sulphur content. Castlecomer coal was sold within a twenty-mile radius of the collieries and the coal was transported by horse and cart. Over time, several important plant and animal fossils have been discovered amongst the shale quarries of Castlecomer. Coal mining ceased in 1969.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present the {{possibilities}} of <b>coal</b> <b>shale</b> combustion in furnaces with bubbling fluidized bed. <b>Coal</b> <b>shale</b> can be autothermally combusted in the fluidized bed, despite the low calorie value and high ash content of fuel. Established concentrations of CO (500 ppm) and VOC (30 mg/m 3) have indicated a high conversion degree of combustible material during combustion process. Average concentrations of SO 2 and NOx in the flue gas were higher than this received from the combustion of high quality hard coal, 600 ppm and 500 ppm, respectively. Optional reduction of SO 2 and NOx emission may require the installation of flue gas desulphurization and de-NOx systems...|$|E
