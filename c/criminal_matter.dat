500|$|Prior {{restraint}} {{has generally}} been regarded by U.S. courts, particularly the U.S. Supreme Court, as being [...] "the most serious and least tolerable" [...] of restrictions on the First Amendment. The Blackstone Commentaries defined {{freedom of the press}} as [...] "laying no previous restraints upon publication, and not in freedom from censure for <b>criminal</b> <b>matter</b> when published." [...] The Supreme Court had however never held that prior restraint was unconstitutional. On the contrary, in Near v. Minnesota 283 U.S. 697 (1931), Chief Justice Charles E. Hughes remarked that in wartime, [...] "no one would question but that a government might prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting service or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops." [...] He further suggested that obscenity or incitement to insurrection would be similar grounds for prior restraint. The court subsequently upheld free speech exceptions such as restrictions on demonstrations in Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569 (1941), and censorship of motion pictures in Times Film Corp. v. City of Chicago, 365 U.S. 43 (1961).|$|E

The American minister to Chile, Patrick Egan, a political friend of Blaine’s, granted asylum to Chileans who were seeking refuge from the Chilean Civil War. Chile was already suspicious of Blaine because of his War of the Pacific diplomacy ten years earlier, and this incident raised tensions even further. When sailors from the Baltimore took shore leave in Valparaíso, a fight broke out, resulting {{in the deaths of}} two American sailors and three dozen arrested. When the news reached Washington, Blaine was in Bar Harbor recuperating from a bout of ill health and Harrison himself drafted a demand for reparations. The Chilean foreign minister, Manuel Antonio Matta, replied that Harrison’s message was “erroneous or deliberately incorrect" [...] and said that the Chilean government was treating the affair the same as any other <b>criminal</b> <b>matter.</b> Tensions increased as Harrison threatened to break off diplomatic relations unless the United States received a suitable apology. Blaine returned to the capital and made conciliatory overtures to the Chilean government, offering to submit the dispute to arbitration and recall Egan. Harrison still insisted on an apology and submitted a special message to Congress about the threat of war. Chile issued an apology for the incident, and the threat of war subsided.|$|E

[...] She added that, [...] "When I was working consistently without being affected by the interferences mentioned above, I filed and paid my taxes. This only stopped when it was necessary to withdraw from society, in order to guarantee the safety and well-being of myself and my family." [...] On June 29, 2012, Hill appeared in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in Newark and pleaded guilty to the charges; her attorney said she would make restitution for the back taxes she owed. By April 22, 2013, Hill had paid back only $50,000 of the $554,000 she owed immediately; U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo criticized Hill, saying [...] "This is not someone who stands before the court penniless. This is a <b>criminal</b> <b>matter.</b> Actions speak louder than words, and there has been no effort here to pay these taxes." [...] Hill also faced possible eviction from her rented home in South Orange as well as a civil lawsuit from the town for running a business out of a home without a zoning permit.|$|E

2500|$|The {{priest is}} bound under the severest {{penalties}} {{to maintain the}} [...] "seal of confession", absolute secrecy about any sins revealed to him in confession. This strict confidentiality {{is known as the}} Seal of the Confessional. According to 983 §1 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, [...] "The sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner and for any reason." [...] Priests, and anyone who witnesses or overhears the confession (say, an interpreter, caregiver, or aide of a person with a disability) may not reveal what they have learned during confession to anyone, even under the threat of their own death or that of others. This is unique to the Seal of the Confessional. Many other forms of confidentiality, including in most states attorney-client privilege, allow ethical breaches of the confidence {{to save the life of}} another. But a priest, or anyone else who witnesses or overhears any part of the confession, who breaks that confidentiality incurs latae sententiae (automatic) excommunication reserved to the Holy See. In a <b>criminal</b> <b>matter,</b> a priest may encourage the penitent to surrender to authorities, however, this is the extent of the leverage he wields: he cannot make this a condition of the absolution and he may not directly or indirectly disclose the matter to civil authorities himself.|$|E
