25|$|The {{reactors}} for Units 1, 2, and 6 were {{supplied by}} General Electric, those for Units 3 and 5 by Toshiba, and Unit 4 by Hitachi. All six reactors {{were designed by}} General Electric. Architectural design for General Electric's units was done by Ebasco. All construction was done by Kajima. Since September 2010, Unit 3 has been fueled by a small fraction (6%) of plutonium containing mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, rather than the low enriched uranium (LEU) used in the other reactors. Units 1–5 were built with Mark I type (light bulb torus) containment structures. The Mark I <b>containment</b> <b>structure</b> was slightly increased in volume by Japanese engineers.

Water in the condensers for reactors 2 and 3 is shifted to outside storage tanks so that the condensers can remove more contaminated water from inside the reactors.

25|$|On 26 and 27 March 2012 {{the inside}} of the {{containment}} vessel of reactor 2 was inspected with a 20 meter long endoscope. With this a dosi-meter was brought into the vessel to measure the radiation levels inside. At the bottom of the primary <b>containment</b> <b>structure,</b> 60 centimeters of water was found, instead of the 3 meters expected at that place. The radiation level measured was 72.9 Sievert per hour. Because of this, the endoscope could only function a few hours at this place. For reactors number 1 and 3, no endoscopic survey was planned at that time, because the actual radiation levels at these places were too high for humans.|$|E

25|$|The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant {{consisted}} of six GE light water boiling water reactors (BWRs) {{with a combined}} power of 4.7 gigawatts, {{making it one of}} the world's 25 largest nuclear power stations. It was the first GE-designed nuclear plant to be constructed and run entirely by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). Reactor 1 was a 439 MWe type (BWR-3) reactor constructed in July 1967, and commenced operation on 26 March 1971. It was designed to withstand an earthquake with a peak ground acceleration of 0.18 g (1.74m/s2) and a response spectrum based on the 1952 Kern County earthquake. Reactors 2 and 3 were both 784 MWe type BWR-4s. Reactor 2 commenced operation in July 1974, and Reactor 3 in March 1976. The earthquake design basis for all units ranged from 0.42g (4.12m/s2) to 0.46g (4.52m/s2). After the 1978 Miyagi earthquake, when the ground acceleration reached 0.125g (1.22m/s2) for 30seconds, no damage to the critical parts of the reactor was found. Units 1–5 have a Mark-1 type (light bulb torus) containment structure; unit 6 has Mark 2-type (over/under) <b>containment</b> <b>structure.</b> In September 2010, Reactor 3 was partially fueled by mixed-oxides (MOX).|$|E

2500|$|The RBMK {{design was}} built {{primarily}} to be powerful, quick {{to build and}} easy to maintain. Full physical containment structures for each reactor would {{have more than doubled}} the cost and construction time of each plant, and since the design had been certified by the Soviet nuclear science ministry as inherently safe when operated within established parameters the Soviet authorities assumed proper adherence to doctrine by workers would make any accident impossible. Additionally, RBMK reactors were designed to allow fuel rods to be changed without shutting down (as in the pressurized heavy water CANDU reactor), both for refueling and for plutonium production (for nuclear weapons). This required large cranes above the core. As the RBMK reactor is very tall (about [...] ), the cost and difficulty of building a heavy <b>containment</b> <b>structure</b> prevented the building of additional emergency containment structures for pipes on top of the reactor. In the Chernobyl accident, the pressure rose to levels high enough to blow the top off the reactor, breaking open the fuel channels in the process and starting a massive fire when air contacted the superheated graphite core. After the Chernobyl accident, some RBMK reactors were retrofitted with a partial <b>containment</b> <b>structure</b> (in lieu of a full containment building), which surround the fuel channels with water jackets in order to capture any radioactive particles released.|$|E

Understanding and measuring transport through cracked concrete is important for describing the initial condition of radioactive waste <b>containment</b> <b>structures</b> at the Savannah River Site (SRS) and for predicting performance of these structures over time. This report transmits {{the results of a}} literature review on transport through cracked concrete which was performed by Professor Jason Weiss, Purdue University per SRR 0000678 (RFP-RQ 00001029 -WY). This review complements the NRC-sponsored literature review and assessment of factors relevant to performance of grouted systems for radioactive waste disposal. This review was performed by The Center for Nuclear Waste Regulatory Analyses, San Antonio, TX, and The University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen Scotland and was focused on tank closure. The objective of the literature review on transport through cracked concrete was to identify information in the open literature which can be applied to SRS transport models for cementitious <b>containment</b> <b>structures,</b> fills, and waste forms. In addition, the literature review was intended to: (1) Provide a framework for describing and classifying cracks in <b>containment</b> <b>structures</b> and cementitious materials used in radioactive waste disposal, (2) Document the state of knowledge and research related to transport through cracks in concrete for various exposure conditions, (3) Provide information or methodology for answering several specific questions related to cracking and transport in concrete, and (4) Provide information {{that can be used to}} design experiments on transport through cracked samples and actual structures...|$|R

2500|$|Smaller, low {{pressure}} containment.

There are no sources of stored energy that could cause a rapid pressure rise (such as Hydrogen or steam) in the containment.

40|$|Fixed-Cone valves {{are often}} used to {{dissipate}} energy and regulate flow at the low level outlet works of dams. Fixed-Cone valves, also known as Howell-Bunger valves, create an expanding conical jet allowing {{the energy of the}} water to dissipate over a large area. However, in many applications constructing the large stilling basin necessary for these valves is either not possible or not feasible. In order to reduce the relative size of the stilling basin, hoods or concrete <b>containment</b> <b>structures</b> have been used in conjunction with Fixed-Cone valves. This paper compares two methods of energy dissipation used in conjunction with concrete <b>containment</b> <b>structures.</b> The first method of energy dissipation is the use of baffles, and the second is a deflector ring with end sill. In order to determine which type of energy dissipation method was most effective for this particular application, measurements and observations were taken in order to compare the amount of energy dissipated by the structure and the Fixed-Cone valve, the air demand of the structure, the velocities downstream of the structure, and flow stability downstream of the structure.

40|$|Two {{modified}} stress-strain {{relations for}} bonded and unbonded internal tendons are proposed. The proposed relations can simulate the post-cracking behavior and tension stiffening effect in prestressed concrete <b>containment</b> <b>structures.</b> In {{the case of}} the bonded tendon, tensile forces between adjacent cracks are transmitted from a bonded tendon to concrete by bond forces. Therefore, the constitutive law of a bonded tendon stiffened by grout needs to be determined from the bond-slip relationship. On the other hand, a stress increase beyond the effective prestress in an unbonded tendon is not section-dependent but member-dependent. It means that the tendon stress unequivocally represents a uniform distribution along the length when the friction loss is excluded. Thus, using a strain reduction factor, the modified stress-strain curve of an unbonded tendon is derived by successive iterations. In advance, the prediction of cracking behavior and ultimate resisting capacity of prestressed concrete <b>containment</b> <b>structures</b> using the introduced numerical models are succeeded, and the need for the consideration of many influencing factors such as the tension stiffening effect, plastic hinge length and modification of stress-strain relation of tendon is emphasized. Finally, the developed numerical models are applied to prestressed concrete <b>containment</b> <b>structures</b> to verify the efficiency and applicability in simulating the structural behavior with bonded and/or unbonded tendons. close 3...|$|R
