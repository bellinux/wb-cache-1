5|$|By {{the early}} <b>Cretaceous</b> {{and the ongoing}} breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were {{becoming}} strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians, iguanodontians, and brachiosaurids through Europe, North America, and northern Africa. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large spinosaurid and carcharodontosaurid theropods, and rebbachisaurid and titanosaurian sauropods, also found in South America. In Asia, maniraptoran coelurosaurians like dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and oviraptorosaurians became the common theropods, and ankylosaurids and early ceratopsians like Psittacosaurus became important herbivores. Meanwhile, Australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians, hypsilophodonts, and iguanodontians. The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct {{at some point in}} the late early <b>Cretaceous</b> or early late <b>Cretaceous.</b> A major change in the early <b>Cretaceous,</b> which would be amplified in the late <b>Cretaceous,</b> was the evolution of flowering plants. At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with tooth batteries, taken to its extreme in hadrosaurids. Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid Nigersaurus.|$|E

5|$|Krause {{wrote that}} UA 8699 {{was the first}} {{marsupial}} to be identified from Madagascar and the first from the Mesozoic of any part of Gondwana. Marsupials {{date back to the}} Eocene in Australia and Africa and to the Paleocene in South America; although <b>Cretaceous</b> marsupials have been recorded there, none of the records are unambiguous. Marsupials were certainly present in the Northern Hemisphere during the late <b>Cretaceous.</b> He interpreted UA 8699 as evidence that marsupials must already have colonized the southern continents by the late <b>Cretaceous,</b> presumably having reached Madagascar through South America and Antarctica. By the late <b>Cretaceous,</b> boreosphenidans must already have been in the process of replacing archaic mammals like gondwanatheres on the southern continents, as suggested by the presence of Deccanolestes, a placental, in the <b>Cretaceous</b> of India.|$|E
5|$|Macroolithus {{is known}} from myriad Late <b>Cretaceous</b> {{locations}} in China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan.|$|E
5|$|Many fossil sites {{worldwide}} contain beetles {{from the}} <b>Cretaceous.</b> Most are in Europe and Asia and {{belong to the}} temperate climate zone during the <b>Cretaceous.</b> Lower <b>Cretaceous</b> sites include the Crato fossil beds in the Araripe basin in the Ceará, North Brazil, as well as overlying Santana formation; the latter was near the equator at that time. In Spain, important sites are near Montsec and Las Hoyas. In Australia, the Koonwarra fossil beds of the Korumburra group, South Gippsland, Victoria, are noteworthy. Major sites from the Upper <b>Cretaceous</b> include Kzyl-Dzhar in South Kazakhstan and Arkagala in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Since Ankylosaurus {{and other}} Late <b>Cretaceous</b> North American ankylosaurids grouped with Asian genera (in a tribe the authors named Ankylosaurini), Arbour and Currie {{suggested}} that earlier North American ankylosaurids had gone extinct {{by the late}} Albian or Cenomanian ages of the Middle <b>Cretaceous.</b> Ankylosaurids thereafter recolonised North America from Asia during the Campanian or Turonian ages of the Late <b>Cretaceous,</b> and diversified there again, leading to genera such as Ankylosaurus, Anodontosaurus, and Euoplocephalus. This explains a 30 million year gap in the fossil record of North American ankylosaurids between these ages.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{unambiguous}} termite fossils date to {{the early}} <b>Cretaceous,</b> but given the diversity of <b>Cretaceous</b> termites and early fossil records showing mutualism between microorganisms and these insects, they likely originated earlier in the Jurassic or Triassic. Further evidence of a Jurassic origin {{is the assumption that}} the extinct Fruitafossor consumed termites, judging from its morphological similarity to modern termite-eating mammals. The oldest termite nest discovered is believed to be from the Upper <b>Cretaceous</b> in West Texas, where the oldest known faecal pellets were also discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the Ferugliotheriidae is overall more limited, both in extent and time, than that of Sudamericidae; sudamericids have been {{recorded}} from the Late <b>Cretaceous</b> to Miocene of Argentina, the Late <b>Cretaceous</b> of Madagascar and India, the Middle Eocene of Antarctica, and perhaps the <b>Cretaceous</b> of Tanzania (TNM 02067, tentatively referred to Sudamericidae). Nevertheless, ferugliotheriids {{may be the only}} gondwanatheres to have had a presence in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 {{mitochondrial}} {{and nuclear}} DNA phylogenetic {{study of the}} parrots, cockatoos and related taxa by utilizing among others the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, provides confirmatory evidence for a Gondwanaland origin of the ancestral parrots in the <b>Cretaceous</b> period, and an Australasia divergence of the ancestral cockatoos from the parrots in either late <b>Cretaceous</b> (66 mya) or Paleogene (45 mya) periods depending on baseline assumptions.|$|E
5|$|Abelisauroids are {{typically}} {{regarded as a}} <b>Cretaceous</b> group, though the earliest abelisaurid remains are known from the Middle Jurassic of Argentina (classified as the species Eoabelisaurus mefi) and possibly Madagascar (fragmentary remains of an unnamed species); possible abelisaurid remains (an isolated left tibia, right femur and right tibia) were also discovered in Late Jurassic Tendaguru Beds in Tanzania. Abelisaurid remains are mainly known in the southern continents, which once made up the supercontinent of Gondwana. When first described in 1985, only Carnotaurus and Abelisaurus were known, both from the Late <b>Cretaceous</b> of South America. Abelisaurids were then located in Late <b>Cretaceous</b> India (Indosuchus and Rajasaurus) and Madagascar (Majungasaurus), which were closely connected {{for much of the}} <b>Cretaceous.</b> It was thought that the absence of abelisaurids from continental Africa indicated that the group evolved after the separation of Africa from Gondwana, around 100 million years ago. However, the discovery of Rugops and other abelisaurid material {{from the middle of the}} <b>Cretaceous</b> in northern Africa disproved this hypothesis. Mid-Cretaceous abelisaurids are now known from South America as well, showing that the group existed prior to the breakup of Gondwana. In 2014, the description of Arcovenator escotae from southern France provided the first indisputable evidence of the presence of Abelisaurids in Europe. Arcovenator presents strong similarities with the Madagascan Majungasaurus and Indian abelisaurids, but not with the South American forms. Arcovenator, Majungasaurus and Indian forms are united in the new clade Majungasaurinae.|$|E
5|$|Argon-argon radiometric dating {{indicates}} that the Kaiparowits Formation was deposited between 76.1 and 74.0million years ago, during the Campanian stage of the Late <b>Cretaceous</b> period. During the Late <b>Cretaceous</b> period, {{the site of the}} Kaiparowits Formation was located near the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland sea that split North America into two landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland peat swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms. This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late <b>Cretaceous</b> terrestrial life in the world.|$|E
5|$|Averianov, Archibald, and Martin instead placed UA 8699 in {{the context}} of faunal {{similarity}} and exchange between the late <b>Cretaceous</b> faunas of Europe and Africa, noting the presence of similar animals, such as snakes (Medtsoia) and sauropods (Lirainosaurus and Repetosaurus), in the <b>Cretaceous</b> faunas of Madagascar and the Spanish locality Laño. They proposed the relationship between Lainodon, which is from Laño, and UA 8699 as another example of this relationship and cited a previous prediction by Gheerbrant and Astibia that zhelestids similar to Lainodon would be found in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Avialans diversified into a {{wide variety}} of forms during the <b>Cretaceous</b> Period. Many groups {{retained}} primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves). While the earliest forms, such as Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis, retained the long bony tails of their ancestors, the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened {{with the advent of the}} pygostyle bone in the group Pygostylia. In the late <b>Cretaceous,</b> around 95 million years ago, the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell.|$|E

5|$|Coria and Salgado {{suggested}} that the convergent evolution of gigantism in theropods could {{have been linked to}} common conditions in their environments or ecosystems. Sereno and colleagues found that the presence of carcharodontosaurids in Africa (Carcharodontosaurus), North America (Acrocanthosaurus), and South America (Giganotosaurus), showed the group had a transcontinental distribution by the Early <b>Cretaceous</b> period. Dispersal routes between the northern and southern continents appear to have been severed by ocean barriers in the Late <b>Cretaceous,</b> which led to more distinct, provincial faunas, by preventing exchange. Previously, it was thought that the <b>Cretaceous</b> world was biogeographically separated, with the northern continents being dominated by tyrannosaurids, South America by abelisaurids, and Africa by carcharodontosaurids. The subfamily Carcharodontosaurinae, in which Giganotosaurus belongs, appears to have been restricted to the southern continent of Gondwana (formed by South America and Africa), where they were probably the apex (top) predators. The South American tribe Giganotosaurini may have been separated from their African relatives through vicariance, when Gondwana broke up during the Aptian–Albian ages of the Early <b>Cretaceous.</b>|$|E

Oligocene volcanic rocks are found in far west Texas in the Big Bend area. A blanket of Miocene sediments known as the Ogallala formation in the western high plains region is an important aquifer. Located far from an active plate tectonic boundary, Texas has no volcanoes and few earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Zhe-Xi Luo {{and colleagues}} {{alternatively}} proposed that a tribosphenic molar pattern had arisen twice (compare Figure 3, top)—once {{giving rise to}} the marsupials and placentals (Boreosphenida), and once producing Ambondro, the <b>Cretaceous</b> Australian Ausktribosphenos, and the living monotremes, which {{first appeared in the}} <b>Cretaceous</b> (united as Australosphenida). They characterized Australosphenida by the shared presence of a cingulum on the outer front corner of the lower molars, a short and broad talonid, a relatively low trigonid, and a triangulated last lower premolar.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Cretaceous,</b> {{a shallow}} seaway spread into the {{interior}} of North America from the Gulf of Mexico in the south into Utah and later to the Arctic Ocean in the far north. Geologists call this shallow sea the <b>Cretaceous</b> Seaway or Western Interior Seaway. The seaway divided North America into two halves: an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient Appalachian Mountains and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains; formed from shallow thrust faulting caused by the Sevier orogeny. As the shoreline moved back and forth, the Bryce area alternated from {{being part of the}} Sevier landmass to being under the <b>Cretaceous</b> Seaway. Alternating layers of nonmarine, intertidal, and marine sediments lay {{on top of each other}} as a result.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 was {{described}} in 2004 by Francisco Goin and colleagues, who tentatively interpreted the tooth as a left last upper molar. Although they saw similarities with South American ungulates, some early rodents, and multituberculates, they believed the tooth was most likely of a gondwanathere. Among gondwanatheres—a small and poorly known group otherwise known from the <b>Cretaceous</b> through Eocene {{of some of the}} southern continents (Gondwana)—they thought the <b>Cretaceous</b> Argentinian Ferugliotherium to be the most similar.|$|E

5|$|Members of this {{superfamily}} first {{arose in}} the late <b>Cretaceous.</b> Leidyosuchus of Alberta is the earliest known genus. Fossil alligatoroids have been found throughout Eurasia as land bridges across both the North Atlantic and the Bering Strait have connected North America to Eurasia during the <b>Cretaceous,</b> Paleogene, and Neogene periods. Alligators and caimans split in North America during the late <b>Cretaceous</b> and the latter reached South America by the Paleogene, before {{the closure of the}} Isthmus of Panama during the Neogene period. The Chinese alligator likely descended from a lineage that crossed the Bering land bridge during the Neogene. The modern American alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the Pleistocene. The alligator's full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the 1990s and it suggests the animal evolved at a rate similar to mammals and greater than birds and most cold-blooded vertebrates. However, the full genome, published in 2014, suggests that the alligator evolved much more slowly than mammals and birds.|$|E

5|$|On {{the west}} side of the {{peninsula}} there are sandstone cliffs along the ocean, called the Sunset Cliffs. Geologically these cliffs are known as the Point Loma Formation.

5|$|Originally, {{the rocks}} in which Carnotaurus was found were {{assigned}} to {{the upper part of the}} Gorro Frigio Formation, which was considered to be approximately 100 million years old (Albian or Cenomanian stage).

5|$|Several highly {{successful}} insect groups—especially the Hymenoptera (wasps, bees and ants) and Lepidoptera (butterflies) {{as well as}} many types of Diptera (flies) and Coleoptera (beetles)—evolved in conjunction with flowering plants during the <b>Cretaceous</b> (145 to 66 million years ago). The earliest bees, important pollinators today, appeared in the early <b>Cretaceous.</b> A group of wasps sister to the bees evolved {{at the same time as}} flowering plants, as did the Lepidoptera.
