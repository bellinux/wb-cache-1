30|$|This {{study showed}} that {{expensive}} fish oil can be replaced by <b>cashew</b> <b>kernel</b> oil in C. gariepinus diet without negatively affecting growth performance. So, this lipid source might be recommended {{in order to reduce}} fish production cost. However, inclusion of <b>cashew</b> <b>kernel</b> oil in the diet of C. gariepinus produced tissue with low concentrations of long chain n- 3 PUFA.

40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{this paper}} {{mathematical}} models describing thin layer drying of <b>cashew</b> <b>kernels</b> in a batch dryer were presented. The range of drying air temperature was 70 – 110 °C. The initial moisture {{content of the}} <b>cashew</b> <b>kernels</b> was 9. 29 % (d. b.) and the final moisture content was {{in the range of}} 3. 5 to 4. 6 % dry-basis. Seven different thin layer mathematical drying models were compared according to their coefficients of determination (R 2) mean square error (MSE) and mean relative deviation modulus (P) to estimate drying curves. The effects of the drying air temperature and time on the drying model constants and coefficients were predicted by multiple regression analysis using linear and non-linear type models. The results have shown that among the models, the Page model was found to be the best for describing the drying behaviour of <b>cashew</b> <b>kernels</b> with R 2, MSE and P values of 0. 9830, 0. 00311 and 5. 046 respectively...|$|R
