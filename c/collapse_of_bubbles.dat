The chemical effects of ultrasound {{are concerned with}} understanding the effect of sonic waves on chemical systems, this is called sonochemistry. [...] The chemical effects of ultrasound do not come from a direct interaction with molecular species. Studies have shown that no direct coupling of the acoustic field with chemical species on a molecular level can account for sonochemistry or sonoluminescence. Instead, sonochemistry arises from acoustic cavitation: the formation, growth, and implosive <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>bubbles</b> in a liquid.|$|E
50|$|The violent <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>bubbles</b> (cavitation) near solid {{surfaces}} {{and the resulting}} impinging jet constitute the mechanism used in ultrasonic cleaning. The same effect, but on a larger scale, is used in focused energy weapons such as the bazooka and the torpedo. Pistol shrimp also use a collapsing cavitation bubble as a weapon. The same effect is used to treat kidney stones in a lithotripter. Marine mammals such as dolphins and whales use bubbles for entertainment or as hunting tools. Aerators cause dissolution of gas in the liquid by injecting bubbles.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{irradiation}} {{with high}} intensity sound or ultrasound, acoustic cavitation usually occurs. Cavitation - the formation, growth, and implosive <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>bubbles</b> irradiated with sound — is {{the impetus for}} sonochemistry and sonoluminescence. [...] Bubble collapse in liquids produces enormous amounts of energy from the conversion of kinetic energy of the liquid motion into heating {{the contents of the}} bubble. The compression of the bubbles during cavitation is more rapid than thermal transport, which generates a short-lived localized hot-spot. Experimental results have shown that these bubbles have temperatures around 5000 K, pressures of roughly 1000 atm, and heating and cooling rates above 1010 K/s. [...] These cavitations can create extreme physical and chemical conditions in otherwise cold liquids.|$|E

Because of the potential damage caused by the coherent <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>bubble</b> clouds, {{there is a need}} for effective numerical models to predict their behavior. This paper presents a newly developed computational methodology to solve a continuum model of bubbly cavitating flow in which a Lagrangian finite volume technique is used to accurately and efficiently track all flow variables in space and time. We also present results for the solution of a one-dimensional model problem, namely cavitating shock waves produced by the normal motion of a wall bounding a semi-infinite domain of fluid.

50|$|In chemistry, {{the study}} of sonochemistry is {{concerned}} with understanding the effect of ultrasound in forming acoustic cavitation in liquids, resulting in the initiation or enhancement of the chemical activity in the solution. Therefore, the chemical effects of ultrasound do not come from adirect interaction of the ultrasonic sound wave with the molecules in the solution. The simplest explanation {{for this is that}} sound waves propagating through a liquid at ultrasonic frequencies do so with a wavelength that is significantly longer than that of the bond length between atoms in the molecule. Therefore, the sound wave cannot affect that vibrational energy of the bond, and can therefore not directly increase the internal energy of a molecule. Instead, sonochemistry arises from acoustic cavitation: the formation, growth, and implosive <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>bubbles</b> in a liquid. The collapse of these bubbles is an almost adiabatic process, thereby resulting in the massive build-up of energy inside the bubble, resulting in extremely high temperatures and pressures in a microscopic region of the sonicated liquid. The high temperatures and pressures result in the chemical excitation of any matter that was inside of, or in the immediate surroundings of the bubble as it rapidly imploded. A broad variety of outcomes can result from acoustic cavitation, including sonoluminescence, increased chemical activity in the solution due to the formation of primary and secondary radical reactions, and increase chemical activity through the formation of new, relatively stable chemical species that can diffuse further into the solution to create chemical effects (for example, the formation of hydrogen peroxide from the combination of two hydroxyl radicals formed following the dissociation of water vapor inside the collapsing bubbles what water is exposed to ultrasound.|$|E

Resistance of cavitation erosion for high polymer materials is ranged between half and 30 times in comparison with that for carbon steels. Cavitation erosion for high polymer materials is caused by fatigue as well as metals. As high polymer materials have relatively small acoustic impedance, impact loads applied by <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>bubbles</b> becomes so small. Therefore, the resistance and incubation period of cavitation erosion for high polymer materials can be evaluated by strain energy in fatigue by taking account of impact energy due to <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>bubbles...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of ultrasonic energy can inactivate many enzymes. The ultrasound shock waves produce cavitation and acoustic streaming in the liquid medium, which generates adequate mechanical, thermal, and chemical effects to inactivate enzymes.

40|$|The present work is {{concerned}} with direct numerical simulations for the shock-bubble and bubble-bubble interactions using the improved ghost fluid method in which the Riemann solutions are utilized to diminish numerical oscillations near interfaces. The influence <b>of</b> <b>bubble</b> size and bubble-bubble distance on the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> in-line two <b>bubbles</b> and in-line three bubbles are investigated to understand {{the conditions under which}} the bubble-bubble interactions accelerate or decelerate the bubble collapse. It is shown that when the in-line bubbles collapse by the incident shock wave, the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> the downstream <b>bubble</b> can be accelerated by the shock waves due to the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> upstream <b>bubbles,</b> while the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> the upstream <b>bubbles</b> is decelerated by the expansion wave cased by the reflection of the incident shock wave at the surface <b>of</b> the downstream <b>bubbles.</b> Also, there exists the bubble-bubble distance in which the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> the downstream <b>bubble</b> is most accelerated. When the downstream bubble is smaller than the upstream bubble, the downstream bubble collapses more violently than the single bubble at any distance between the <b>bubbles.</b> The phase <b>of</b> the downstream <b>bubble</b> at the impact of the shock waves generated from the upstream bubbles is important in determining the acceleration <b>of</b> the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> the downstream <b>bubble.</b> It is also shown that the pressure increase in liquid near the axis of symmetry around the downstream bubble increases with the increase <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>bubbles</b> and with the decrease of the bubble-bubble distance because the pressure increase in liquid is caused by the superposition of the shock waves generated from all bubbles...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{shows that}} asset price bubbles {{typically}} precede financial crises and financial crises {{are accompanied by}} the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>bubbles.</b> In addition, stock market booms and busts are typically associated with credit market booms and busts. The recent US housing and stock market bubbles and the subsequent Great Recession that began in late 2007 provide an example. The stock market booms in the early 1990 s and the subsequent Asian financial crisis in 1997 provide another example. There are also many other related episodes of financial crises in emerging economies. Motivated by these observations, Miao and Wang (2011 a) propose a theory of credit-driven stock price bubbles. We show that a positive feedback loop mechanism generates stock price bubbles when firms borrow against the stock market value of their collateralized assets to finance investment. We assume that firms face stochastic investment opportunities and bubbles improve investment efficiency. We also study stochastic bubbles and policy implications. In the present paper, we apply the theory developed by Miao and Wang (2011 a) to {{an environment in which}} firms face idiosyncratic productivity shocks and credit constraints. We show that both bubbleless and bubbly equilibria can exist. In the bubbly equilibrium, more productive firms have higher stock price bubbles. These bubbles allow firms to relax credit constraints and improve investment efficiency and capital allocation. Consequently, more capital is allocated to more productive firms, leading to a rise in total factor productivity (TFP). 1 On the other hand, the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>bubbles</b> tightens the credit constraints and worsens investment efficiency. Thus, the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>bubbles</b> leads to a recession and a fall of TFP. Our theory may help explain the empirical evidence documented b...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} change in the {{adjustment}} mechanism of Japan's labor market before and after the <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>bubble</b> economy around early 1990 s. Comparison of Phillips curves among industrialized countries shows that Japan's Phillips curve has become much flatter in the 1990 s. The steeper Phillips curve before the 1990 s would be attributable to nominal wage flexibility reflecting flexible bonus payments or annual spring wage negotiations, slow employment adjustment, and the large discouraged worker effects. On the other hand, the flatter Phillips curve after 1990 s and onward would be attributable to the existence of downward nominal wage rigidity under the low and negative inflation rate as well as a decline in discouraged worker effects. Therefore, it is concluded that while slow employment adjustment mechanism did not change so much, fast wage adjustment mechanism deteriorated to some extent due to downward nominal wage rigidity in the 1990 s, and also flexible labor supply adjustment such as discouraged worker effects got smaller in the 1990 s. We also explore the reasons for a persistent rise in Japan's unemployment rate after <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>bubble</b> economy, emphasizing a lack of nominal shock absorption due to downward rigidity in nominal wages that created unemployment, slow employment adjustment mechanism that prevented the employment from recovering, and weak discouraged worker effects that kept unemployment rate high. ...|$|R
