The article chooses Na, LiPb and LBE {{three kinds}} of metal coolant, and makes a {{comparative}} analysis of the thermophysical properties of Na, LiPb and LBE when they are at liquid state. The results show that Na has the lowest density and the largest thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity. There is a small difference between LBE and LiPb in terms of density, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity. LiPb has the largest kinematic viscosity. The thermal conductivity of Na decreases as temperature rises, which is opposite of LBE and LiPb. The kinematic viscosity of LiPb increases as temperature rises.

However, it is easily identified by the roughness of leaf touch. The large trichomes develop {{on both sides of}} the leaf blades. The direction of trichome is both acropetal and basipetal. It is clearly distinguished from the extremely long trichome controlled by Pub gene. About 2, 300 varieties of our Barley Germplasm Center were screened by the leaf touch to find nine varieties with large trichome. Two of them were six-rowed local variety from Pakistan, and other seven were two-rowed varieties from Europe and Japan. All of them were hulled type. Crosses of six large trichome varieties with a normal Japanese variety resulted in the large trichome type F 1 s, suggesting the dominant nature of the trait. The large trichome line Hokuiku 17 was crossed with various linkage testres to study the mode of inheritance and the linkage relationship of the gene. In the F 2 populations, the large trichome was controlled by a single dominant gene named Ltr (large trichome), which was independentiy inherited from the following marker genes; br and gl- 5 on chromosome 1; li and ν on chromosome 2; uz on chromosome 3; K and gl- 3 on chromosome 4; trd on chromosome 5; ο on chromosome 6.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of PCR-based tools for characterisation of organisms has greatly advanced {{our understanding of}} the phylogenies and species boundaries in entomopathogenic fungi, especially the widespread taxa Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae. These fungi have received a lot of interest due to their potential as biocontrol agents of pests. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the fundamental ecology of these fungi in both managed and natural ecosystems, but such information is necessary both for risk assessments prior to release of biocontrol agents in the environment as well as if we wish to understand the distribution of the fungi and their impact on host populations. This latter focus is essential if the fungi are to be included in pest management strategies based on conservation biological control. 	A series of unspecific PCR methods have been used to characterise isolates of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae, and many studies have concluded that the fungi contain a lot of genetic diversity. The problem with these methods is that they provide little phylogenetic information of the fungi and the <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used to explicitly compare data between studies. Sequences from specific targets in the DNA provide tools for explicit comparison between isolates across studies. There is now a range of primer sets published along with reference sequences in GenBank to make these comparisons possible. Multi-gene phylogenies have revealed that both B. bassiana and M. anisopliae are complexes of species that contain cryptic taxa or clades. Using merely morphological characteristics will not result in the same degree of taxa identification as will the use of DNA sequence data. Similarly, when using microsatellite markers for population genetic studies of fungal communities, it is necessary to first separate the populations in clades as allele sizes can convert across populations. In the near future, USDA-ARS in Beltsville will launch a web-based platform (MBID, Metarhizium-Beauveria ID) including lists of primers, databases of reference sequences and type isolates of new described species for the reliable identification of taxa for the scientific community. This tool should provide a common framework and nomenclature for scientists and create basis for making comparisons among studies. There should be great potential {{to learn more about the}} ecology of the entomopathogenic fungi with the application of these molecular markers. However, designing an appropriate sampling scheme in the environment is absolutely necessary to conduct these ecological studies.

40|$|AbstractThe {{well-known}} Pontryagin Duality Theorem {{states that}} a locally compact, commutative topological group is isomorphic to its second character group, i. e., the character group of its character group. Here the character group carries the compact-open topology. There are various papers dealing with generalizations of the theorem to not necessarily locally compact commutative groups. In 1971 we suggested {{to replace the}} compact-open topology in the general case by the continuous convergence structure. This structure coincides with the compact-open topology if the group is locally compact and gives at least better categorical properties in the so-called c-duality theory. We just {{mention the fact that}} the natural mapping from a convergence group (always assumed to be commutative) into its second c-character group is always continuous. In recent years this approach has attracted again attention. In this paper we study the behaviour of the c-duality under the usual topological constructions. We show that the c-character group of a product of convergence groups is isomorphic the the coproduct (in the category of convergence groups) of the c-character groups and that the c-character group of a coproduct is isomorphic the the product of the c-character groups. So products and coproducts of c-reflexive convergence groups are c-reflexive again. Also the character group of a quotient group is isomorphic to its annihilator group. As it is well known, subgroups are very difficult to handle, since its <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> always <b>be</b> extended to the whole group. We give sufficient conditions to guarantee that the c-character group of a subgroup is isomorphic to a quotient of the c-character group of the whole group and also that a subgroup of a c-reflexive group is c-reflexive. In the last section we handle topological groups. We show that the c-character group of a topological group is locally compact and so the second c-character group is also topological. We show that the natural mapping from the group into its second character group is an embedding if and only if the group is locally quasi-convex, a notion introduced by Banaszczyk in 1991...|$|R
40|$|Formulae {{and special}} <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{reproduced}} here. Please see the pdf {{version of the}} Abstract for an accurate reproduction. ] The thesis provides a comprehensive study on the behaviour of sand {{with a small amount}} of fines [i. e. 1 / 3 plastic fines and 2 / 3 non-plastic fines]. The work is carried out experimentally under axi-symmetric conditions using the triaxial apparatus. Conventional drained triaxial tests are conducted on isotropic consolidated specimens and all the tests indicate that sand with fines does not manifest any unusual behaviour under drained conditions. However in undrained shearing the so-called reverse behaviour is noted. The study demonstrates that the reverse behaviour conforms to the critical state framework because significant changes in the position and geometry of the critical state [CS] and isotropic consolidation [IL] lines are caused by the presence of fines. These changes cannot be adequately modelled by the intergranular void ratio as proposed by Thevanayagam and Mohan (2000). This study also demonstrates that the original state parameter [special character] as proposed by Been and Jefferies (1985) <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an adequate parameter to predict the undrained behaviour trend. A new parameter termed modified state parameter [special character] is proposed to account for the combined effects of density and confining pressure. The suitability of the modified state parameter to characterise the response of parent sand and sand with fines is assessed for a range of void ratios and confining pressures. The effect of drained stress history is an important factor affecting the subsequent undrained response. Drained pre-shearing to failure is found to improve considerably the subsequent undrained response to the extent that liquefaction may not occur. Different drained pre-shearing histories have different effects on the undrained response. However in these tests [special character] has limitations in quantifying the subsequent undrained stress-strain response. Hence, a new framework of yielding parameter [special character] extends the capability of [special character] and additional data is presented to demonstrate the suitability of this concept. The implementation of [special character] depends on whether the previous stress state reached during the stress history is below or at failure. The effects of drained pre-shearing on the position and movement of failure surface are investigated. It is found that drained pre-shearing to failure at larger confining pressures has the effect of shifting upwards part of the drained failure surface. The shift at larger stress ratios [special character] may be described in terms of dilatancy and modified state parameter at failure. The so-called strain path tests are conducted to study the influence of strain increment ratio on the deformation behaviour of sand with fines. It is found that the value of [special character] has significant effects on the stress-strain behaviour. Along negative [special character] paths the soil strain softens in the form of decreasing the shear resistance before reaching the failure state. In contrast, along positive [special character] paths the soil strain hardens to an asymptotic stress ratio. The asymptotic stress ratio decreases with increasing [special character] along a linear relationship. The framework of [special character] cannot quantify the stress-strain response along positive and negative strain paths. Consequently an instability parameter [special character] is proposed to extend the capabilities of [special character] and the reliability of this parameter is further assessed. The behaviour along a range of positive and negative [special character] paths is investigated on pre-sheared specimens. In negative [special character] the effective stress paths reach a surface located higher than the monotonic failure surface on which they trace downward towards the origin of stress space. The results indicate this surface may be the same as the drained failure envelope which has been shifted as a result of drained pre-shearing. In positive [special character] paths a large improvement is noted in both the strength and stiffness of the soil. Note: The parameters [special character] and [special character] are all generalisations of [special character] so that the behaviour under complex conditions can be characterised...|$|R
40|$|From {{the studies}} of the {{ontogeny}} of the seed plants and the true ferns the different characters in these two groups are summarized in Table 1. [Table] The supposed phylogenetic original plants composed under the consideration of those characters listed in Table I are as follows : 1. That of the ferns resembles the prothallium of the living ones. The cell division occurs when the nucleus divides in the cell, making uninuclear multicelullar filament first, leaving a growing point {{at the tip of}} the body. After a little while it grows 2 -dimentionally due to the division of the growing point cell by terns, producing the cells of the thallus. Semiterraneus. The reproductive cells are zoospores. 2. That of the seed plant resembles the seedling of the living seed plant, composed of a stalk and a leafy upper portion. The initial cell developes first as the multinuclear cell, then to the uninuclear multicellular thallus. Subterraneus. The reproductive cells are swarm spores. In the later phylogenetic stage there appeared different kinds of sexual reproduction in the above two, which induced the alternation of the n-(gametophyte) and 2 n-(sporophyte) generations, the terraneus habit, the differentiation of the vascular bundles, the spore formation in the sporophyte generation, and the resting type spores in the fern plants, while the parasitic type in the seed plants. Now we can find out the resemblances of those two types in the item 1 and 2 in the living green algae, belonging to different systematic types. They suggest to us that the seed plants and the ferns derived from different ancestors and were parallel existences in the phylogenetic ages having no implication between them. In Table 1 we can find out that there we can trace back the cause of the differences of many characters in both groups into the protoplasmic character in their initial cells. And the latter more importantly leads the writer to consider that such fundamental character as that which concerns to the protoplasmic behaviours conducting the ontogeny in such large group as the seed plants could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> derived from such a differentiated group as the ferns. As for the common characters in them, (1) they have similar type chloroplasts. However, we can find out a similar case in the green algae as well as in the green plants in other systematic groups. It is one of certain universal characters with certain broad distributions in the plant kingdom; (2) they have vascular bundle, which is considered an important character by which they are classified in the same group as the vascular plants, but it looks to the writer that this character <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a unique one in these two groups; it appears in the moss, though very primitive, and the sieve tube develops in the brown algae such as laminaria. Thus the cause of the appearance of the vascular bundles is to be considered as the results of the plant body developed 3 -dimentionally and thickened in the 2 n-generation due to the doubling of the nuclear phase, namely there appears a part in the center of the body, where the light <b>can</b> <b>not</b> reach from the outside so that the cells <b>can</b> <b>not</b> develop as the synthetic tissue and also there accumurate the synthetic products transferred from the differentiated synthetic tissue outside; thus there developes the reserving tissue, then conductive sieve cells or tubes. The self-digestion in certain cells among those reserve cells may cause the xylem elements. The latter may be the ones which were induced by the terrestrial habit. In short the possibilities of the appearance of the reserve or conductive tissue exist in several different kinds of the plant groups, and the terrestrial habit forced the development of the tendencies. Consequently the presence of these two common <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> recognized as the direct proof of the assumption that the ferns and seed plants have the intimate phylogenetic relationship. Here the writer wishes to say that in the field of the phylogenetic studies we have to consider more details from the comparative studies of the ontogeny in the plants, and we have to select in this field the different standards from those in {{the studies of}} the derivation of certain small groups or some organs in the living things...|$|R

Our method uses animator-driven data to produce high quality {{lip synchronization}} in multiple languages. Our method is well-suited for animation pipelines, since it uses static facial poses or blendshapes and can be directly edited by an animator, and modified as needed on a per-character basis. We demonstrate a lip animation (lip sync) algorithm for real-time applications {{that can be used to}} generate synchronized facial move-ments with audio generated from natural speech or a text-to-speech engine. Our method requires an animator to construct animations using a canonical set of visemes for all pairwise combinations of a reduced phoneme set (phone bigrams). These animations are then stitched together to construct the final animation, adding velocity and lip-pose constraints. This method can be applied to any charac-ter that uses the same, small set of visemes. Our method can operate efficiently in multiple languages by reusing phone bigram anima-tions that are shared among languages, and specific word sounds can be identified and changed on a per-character basis. Our method uses no machine learning, which offers two advantages over tech-niques that do: 1) data can be generated for non-human <b>characters</b> whose faces <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> easily retargeted from a human speaker’s face, and 2) the specific facial poses or shapes used for animation can be specified during the setup and rigging stage, and before the lip animation stage, thus making it suitable for game pipelines or circumstances where the speech targets poses are predetermined, such as after acquisition from an online 3 D marketplace...|$|R

Within the framework of this theory the attention of many authors was for long attracted to the study of linear groups over various asso-ciative rings containing the subgroup of diagonal matrices. One should remark that the most complete survey devoted to the subject is presented in 1. In the course of such an investigation the question about the description of subgroups of the special linear group of degree 2 over a field that contain the subgroup of diagonal matrices (with determinant 1) turned out to be unexpectedly tough (2., 3., 4., 5.). Such situation is favored by linear groups of small degrees which <b>are</b> <b>not</b> subject to many of rules that apply to linear groups of larger degrees. Accordingly, while small linear groups sound straightforward, many of very real problems concerning them are far from being settled. For exam-ple, the solution of the above question given in 6. has extremely calculating <b>character</b> and, therefore, <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> extended to groups which contain not the whole group of diagonal matrices but only a part (a subgroup) of thi...|$|R

The mobility and peak drift velocity of this material are predicted to be extremely high and superior to that of gallium nitride. However, many material properties such as {{the origin of the}} n-type conductivity and the electronic band gap <b>are</b> <b>not</b> well understood. Moreover, there is limited information on the stoichiometry and the level of impurity contaminations in the films from different growth techniques. The n-type conductivity observed for as-grown indium nitride films has long been attributed to nitrogen vacancies, implying that the material is nitrogen deficient. A band gap value around 2 eV, as measured by the optical absorption method, is suggested by some authors to be a result of the formation of an InNIn 2 O 3 alloy. Alternatively, the observation of a lower absorption edge, suggesting a band gap around 0. 7 eV, may be caused by Mie scattering at indium clusters that may form during film growth. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy and x-ray techniques provide only qualitative composition information. The quantitative interpretation of the results relies on calibration samples which <b>are</b> <b>not</b> available for indium nitride. In Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, while quantitative, the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen signals cannot be separated unless the film is very thin ([tilde] 150 nm). However, with heavy ion Elastic Recoil Detection (ERD) analysis all the elements in indium nitride films can be fully separated even for a film thickness of [tilde] 800 nm. In this work, indium nitride films from different growth techniques have been analysed with ERD using 200 MeV 197 Au projectiles. The observed nitrogen depletion during the ERD analysis was monitored as a function of projectile fluence using a gas ionisation detector with a large solid angle. Different models have been tested and {{it has been shown that}} the bulk molecular recombination model accurately describes the nitrogen depletion so that the original nitrogen-to- indium ratio can be measured with an accuracy of [plus or minus] 3 [percent]. The correlation of nitrogen depletion rate and stopping power of the projectile ion has been investigated. The study has shown that the rate of depletion is slower for low-Z projectiles. It has been shown that for a film with good structural properties, no loss of nitrogen occurs during the ERD analysis with low-Z projectiles such as 42 MeV 32 S. Thus, the original nitrogen-to-indium ratio can be obtained without any theoretical modelling, and with a precision of better than [plus or minus] 1 [percent]. All the indium nitride films studied in this work, for which X-ray diffraction shows no metallic indium, are nitrogen-rich which is contradictory to expectation. Therefore, the common assertion that nitrogen vacancies are the cause of n-type conductivity in as-grown films is difficult to explain. Instead, the existence of In vacancies, N antisites and interstitial N 2 may be speculated. The carbon and oxygen contamination is an issue for films grown by all common growth techniques. However, the suggested correlation of oxygen content in the film with the apparent band gap <b>is</b> <b>not</b> supported by the ERD results. Instead, a correlation between nitrogen-to-indium ratio and the measured band gap has been observed for films grown by RF-sputtering. This work reports the implantation of radioisotope probes using negative ions. The 111 In/Cd probe was selected for this work as it is a common Perturbed Angular Correlation (PAC) probe and ideally suited for the study of indium nitride. For the synthesis of the probe 111 In/Cd, several possibilities, such as the production of 111 In/Cd via nuclear fusion evaporation reactions and from commercially available 111 InCl 3 solutions, were explored. Different materials, including powders of Al 2 O 3 and In 2 O 3, were investigated as a carrier for the probe in the ion source of the radioisotope implanter. It has been established that combining the 111 InCl 3 solution as the source and In 2 O 3 powder as the carrier material gives optimum implantation efficiency. The radioisotope implanter facility has been developed to a stage that the radioisotope probe 111 In/Cd can be routinely implanted into materials as molecular 111 InO¯ ions. An implantation rate of 3 x 10 4 [th] Becquerel per hour has been demonstrated. Measurements on different materials (Ag, In, Ni, Si, InP) have shown that condensed matter spectroscopies such as Low Temperature Nuclear Orientation, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance on Oriented Nuclei (NMRON) and Perturbed Angular Correlation can be reliably performed. NMRON measurements on silver indicate a new resonance frequency of 75. 08 MHz for 111 InAg at 8. 0 T. The local lattice environment of indium nitride thin films has been investigated with PAC spectroscopy. Several methods of introducing a radioisotope probe into a host material have been investigated for indium nitride. The thermal diffusion of the radioisotope probe 111 In/Cd into indium nitride at a temperature below the dissociation temperature (about 550 [degrees] C) <b>was</b> <b>not</b> possible. The probe was, however, successfully introduced into indium nitride films with ion implantation techniques. Recoil implantation at MeV energies following fusion evaporation reactions and ion implantation at keV energies, both have been investigated for indium nitride films. An interaction frequency of v = 28 MHz has been measured for the 111 In/Cd probe in indium nitride. This result is consistent with that obtained for indium nitride bulk grains. The PAC results suggest that all types of indium nitride films have a highly disordered lattice which could only be partially improved by annealing. Furnace annealing in nitrogen atmosphere above 400 [degrees] C resulted in the dissociation of the film. However, such dissociation could be avoided with rapid thermal annealing up to 600 [degrees] C. More detailed defect studies with PAC require the availability of better material. This study has also shown that indium nitride is highly sensitive to ion beam irradiation. Severe depletion of nitrogen during exposure to ions with MeV and KeV energies is an issue for the ion beam characterisation and processing of indium nitride...|$|R
