[...] And as Ermine {{commenced}} her refusal, she {{went on in the}} same coaxing way, with a description of her plans for Ermine's comfort, giving her two rooms on the ground floor, and assuring her of the absence of steps, the immunity from all teasing by the children, of the full consent of her sister, and the wishes of the <b>Colonel,</b> <b>nay,</b> when Ermine was still unpersuaded of the exceeding kindness it would be to herself. [...] "You see I am terribly young, really," [...] she said, [...] "though I have so many boys, and my aunt thinks it awkward for me to have so many officers calling, and I can't keep them away because they are my father's and Sir Stephen's old friends; so please do come and make it all right!" ...|$|R

[...] "I was very angry and wild at the time when he and I met last, <b>Colonel</b> Wolfe. <b>Nay,</b> perhaps he was right in sending back those trinkets, hurt as I was at his doing so. Go down to him, will you be so kind, sir? and tell him I am sorry, and ask his pardon, and--and, God bless him for his generous behaviour." [...] And here the young gentleman turned his head away, and rubbed his hand across his eyes.|$|R
