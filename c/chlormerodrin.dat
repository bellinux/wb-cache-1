40|$|ABSTRACT The {{reactions}} of three organic mercurial compounds, <b>chlormerodrin,</b> parachloromercuribenzoate (PCMB), and parachloromercuribenzenesulfonate (PCMBS) with intact red blood cells, hemolyzed red cells, hemoglobin solutions, and hemoglobin-free ghosts have been characterized. Both PCMB and PCMBS react with only 2 to 3 sulfhydryl groups per mole of hemoglobin in solution, whereas <b>chlormerodrin</b> reacts with 6 to 7. In hemoglobin-free ghosts, however, all three reagents react {{with a similar}} number of sulfhydryl groups, approximately 4 X 10 - 17 moles per cell, or about 25 per cent of the total stromal sulfhydryl groups, which react with inorganic mercuric chloride. In the intact cell the membrane imposes a diffusion barrier; <b>chlormerodrin</b> and PCMB penetrate slowly, whereas PCMBS does not. Kinetic studies of <b>chlormerodrin</b> binding to intact cells reveal {{that the majority of}} stromal sulfhydryl groups is located inside the diffusion barrier, with only 1 to 1. 5 per cent (or 1 to 1, 400, 000 sites per cell) located outside of this barrier. Reaction of PCMBS with intact cells is limited to this small fraction on the outer membrane surface. All three reagents are capable of inhibiting glucose transport in the red cell. With <b>chlormerodrin</b> and PCMBS it was demonstrated that the inhibition results from interactions with the sulfhydryl groups located on the outer surface of the membrane...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} and found {{valuable}} a numerical value best {{designated as the}} “renal <b>chlormerodrin</b> uptake”. This represents not a transient state, like the renogram, but a measurement of the biological ability of the renal tubules to firmly bind 203 Hg <b>chlormerodrin</b> presented to them as a very small standard dose passing through the kidney. Normal kidneys bind a remarkably fixed portion, {{and there is a}} consistent parallel between retention and tubular function...|$|E
40|$|The [203]Hg-labelled <b>Chlormerodrin</b> {{has been}} mainly used for kidney scintigraphy. However, [197]Hg-labelled <b>Chlormerodrin</b> has the {{possibilities}} of repeated examinations and application to pediatrics because [197]Hg has shorter half-life and less radiation exposure to patients than [203]Hg. Here fundamental and clinical investigation on [197]Hg-Chlormerodrin for kidney scanning agent was performed with an idea that this scanning agent will be widely used in place of [203]Hg. <b>Chlormerodrin</b> in the near future. Total 20 cases were examined using [197]Hg-Chlormerodrin and these results were {{compared with those of}} [203]Hg-Chlormerodrin. There were some differences in conditions of taking the scintigrams, but no differences on obtained scintigrams were recognized. The most suitable time period for taking the scintigrams with [197]Hg-Chlormerodrin was 3 to 24 hours after the intravenous administration. The remaining radioactivity of [197]Hg-Chlormerodrin in kidney 10 days after the intravenous administration was not observed because of its short physical halflife of 2. 7 days and excretion in urine. The radioactivities of [197]Hg-Chlormerodrin in the urine decreased as 100 : 10 : 1 = in the first 24 hours: the second 24 hrs. : the third 24 hrs. No radioactivity was recognized after the third day...|$|E
40|$|Emergence of drug {{resistance}} {{has been observed}} frequently in the urinary tract infections, {{and the importance of}} proper choice of antimicrobic agents has been repeatedly stressed for its treatment. Clinically it seems, however, to be most important to eradicate the {{drug resistance}} purposefully. <b>Chlormerodrin</b> reported by Seneca et al. is the only one for its purpose. Considerations based on the long term examinations of drug sensitivity of bacteria infected in the urinary tract of the chronic traumatic paraplegics in our hospital suggest that the intravenous administration of urea 30 - 60 g daily is far more effective than <b>chlormerodrin</b> to eradicate the drug resistance of bacteria infected in the urinary tract, at least clinically. The role of urea in urine on the pathogenesis of urinary tract infectio n and on the emergence and eradication of drug resistance should be evaluated bacteriologically and clinically in future...|$|E
40|$|From an industrial-health standpoint, {{mercury is}} well known because simple mercury {{compounds}} volatilize at room temperature (1 â€” 3). Chiormero drin, {{the most commonly used}} radioactive mercury compound, is not generally recognized as a volatile substance. Yet, the pharmacological activity of a mercurial diuretic depends on the lability of the carbon-mercury bond. Therefore, solutions of chlor merodrin might be expected to contain free radio active mercury and to release mercury vapors into the air because both elemental mercury and mer curic chloride vaporize slowly. Our study shows that radioactive <b>chlormerodrin</b> releases radioactivity into the air at room temperature, producing a contamina tion in the rooms where it is used. This radioactivity has a tendency to adsorb to glassware and to amal gamate into gold jewelry. Although 203 Hg levels have not been sufficient to pose a health hazard in our lab oratory, a slow buildup of contamination could occur. This problem warrants consideration because of the long physical and biological half-life of 203 Hg. METHOD In these studies, pharmacologicallyprepared 203 Hg and 197 Hg <b>chlormerodrin</b> were used as they were received from multiple suppliers. <b>Chlormerodrin</b> was shipped in rubber-stoppered multi-injection bottles containing 5 or 15 mc radioactive mercury in about 10 ml of solution. We determined release of radio active vapor by placing each bottle in separate 400 -mi glass chambers (beakers) containing an open well in which 2 ml of 40 % trichloracetic acid solu tion (TCA) had been pipetted. The chambers were sealed with Paraflim and masking tape and left at room temperature in subdued light for 24 hr. At that time 1. 0 ml of trichioracetic acid solution was removed, and its gamma activity was determined in a scintillation well counter. Sufficient counts were obtained to result in a 5 % average statistical count ing error when radioactivity was measurable (detec tion limit is about 5. 0 X 10 Â...|$|E
40|$|Nine examples, {{in seven}} patients, {{from a large}} cadaver renal {{allograft}} program, illustrate the value of radio-hippuran photoscans in differentiating causes of post-implant oliguria. Hippuran scans are shown to be more valuable than <b>chlormerodrin</b> scans when renal function is acutely depressed. Hippuran scans aided {{in the decision to}} remove kidneys in four cases of severe oliguria and to retain kidneys in two others. In two further examples, extravasation of urine was detected by scanning after radio-hippuran injection when other tests had failed to do so...|$|E
40|$|Available {{data are}} {{inadequate}} concerning the physi ologic mechanisms of localization {{of the major}} techne tium-labeled renal imaging agents, although they are achieving increasing clinical use. A few reports of studies of these compounds describe their organ distribution in laboratory animals (1 â€” 3) and their potential for clinical use in humans (4, 5). Arnold and co-workers reported high renal cortical concentrations of DMSA in the dog and in human studies (6), which appeared {{similar to those of}} the mercury <b>chlormerodrin</b> compounds (7). These data have been quoted to support the suggestion that Tc- 99 m DMSA may be the best available techne tium-labeled agent for determining relative functional renal mass. It has been shown that organ distribution of DMSA can be altered markedly by the method of preparation, and especially by the original pH (8 â€” 10, 22). Th...|$|E
40|$|When {{malignant}} cells, {{animal and}} human, were exposed in vitro to solutions of heavy metals oi other selected compounds, {{three types of}} cell blebs were produced: (1) acentric blebs, arising {{from one side of}} the cell, e. g., by <b>chlormerodrin,</b> meralluride sodium, mercuric chloride; (2) symmetrical blebs; which completely enveloped the cell, e. g., by strong silver protein, auric chloride, p-chloromercuribenzoate; (']) scallop blebs, numerous small spherical elevations which completely covered the cell, e. g., by N-ethyl-maleimide, trivalent arsenicals, iodoacetamide. As indicated by vital stains and morphologic appearance, the blebs arose in healthy cells. They also can be made to appear in vivo in ascites tumor cells by intraperitoneal administration of a blebbing agent. All the bleb-producing chemicals have the property of reacting with protein-sulfhydryl groups by alkylation, oxidation or mercaptide formation. The three bleb types have been induced in 8 mouse and 2 rat ascites tumor cells; in 4 human and 1 mouse malignant cell lines; and in 3 normal cell lines grown in tissue culture. In contrast, cells from normal solid tissues of liver, lung, spleen, kidney, testis and brain from mouse, rat and rabbit failed to produce blebs. A possible interpretation for these observations is presented...|$|E
40|$|Conventional renal {{cortical}} imaging agent, 203 Hg <b>chlormerodrin,</b> {{has become}} replaced by 99 mTc tagged agents, {{because of its}} high radiation hazard to attain high quality imaging especially by scintillation camera. Among these reported agents with 9 gmTc labeling, a new radiopharmaceutical, 90 mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), was evaluated for its validity of renal cortical visualization. Primaily, ten subjects with normal renal function were selected for kinetic studies. The initial distribution was mainly seen in the plasma compartment with negligible quantities of the label on red blood cells. Plasma clearance as well as urine accumulation data indicated that more than 50 % of the administered dose was retained in the kidney, at least, during the present observation until 24 hours. These characteristics with higher affinity for renal cortex than these of other reported agents appear to be well suited for renal cortical imaging. By reviewing clinical studies of more than hundred cases, excellent cortical imaging was proved to be useful for the regional characterization of renal cortex and, further, to facilitate the definite delineation of cortical abnormalities even in an equivocal case who underwent the pyelography and/or selective renal angiography...|$|E
40|$|I n {{view of the}} {{clinical}} importance of myocardial lesions, a technique for visualizing them in the intact patient is clearly desirable. The advent of scintilla-tion scanning suggested a promising ap-proach to this problem. The first encourag-ing result was the finding that dogs with experimental myocardial infarcts showed less concentration of rubidium- 86 {{in the area of}} infarction than in normal myo-cardium. 1 This permitted clear visualiza-tion of the infarct if the heart were subse-quently removed from the dog, but the high energy of the gamma emission of rubidium- 86 made it unsuitable for studies of the heart in situ. The next step, demon-stration of experimental myocardial in-farcts through the intact chest wall of the living animal, was first successfully ac-complished by the use of mercury- 203 -labeled <b>chlormerodrin.</b> 2 When applied to human beings, however, this technique proved to be only irregularly successful. 3 The development of a method for obtain-ing suitable quantities of cesium- 131 for use in human beings has now permitted the use of the latter isotope in myocardial scanning. 3 The present communication demonstrates the usefulness of cesium- 131 in experimental myocardial infarcts in dogs and in myocardial infarcts in human beings...|$|E
40|$|The rnicrosomal enzyme inhibitor, / 3 -diethyl-aminoethyl diphenylpropylacetate {{hydrochloride}} (SKF 525 -A), {{has been}} demonstrated to induce natruresis when infused into the renal artery of the dog (Marshall and Williamson, 1964). Ex-cretion of chloride parallels sodium output {{and there is also}} a small increase in excretion of potassium. In contrast to other natruretic agents, S}F 525 -A has a very short duration of action. Sodium excretion is increased during the first minute of administration and this in-crease is maintained only as long as the agent is infused. Sodium excretion returns to control levels within 1 or 2 minutes after the drug is discontinued. These effects {{are similar to those of}} local anesthetics (Hook and Williamson, 1964). Pitts et at. (1958) demonstrated that the natruretic effect of chlorothiazide or acetazolam-ide could be superimposed upon a maximal natruresis produced by <b>chlormerodrin.</b> This suggested that these agents inhibit renal sodium transport by different mechanisms. They con-cluded that these natruretic agents may inhibit different transport mechanisms or interfere with different enzymatic reactions supplying energy to a single transport mechanism. The rapid onset of natruresis upon infusion of SKF 525 -A and the equally rapid termination of activity upon withdrawal suggest that the natruretic action of this agent differs from the natruretic action of other agents. If this is true, then it should be possible, using the method employed by Pitts et al. (1958), to superimpose the natruretic action of SKF 525 -A upon the Received for publication March 30, 1964. 1 Preliminary presentation of these data was made at the meeting of the Federation of Amen...|$|E
40|$|Renin {{activities}} were measured in plasma from an artery {{and from the}} hepatic, portal, and renal veins of anesthetized dogs. A significant arterial-hepatic venous renin difference was observed during control periods and after elevation of arterial renin by stimulation of endogenous renin secretion (in-duced by acute salt depletion) or by infusion of exogenous renin. There was good quantitative agreement between the calculated rates of renin infusion and hepatic renin clearance. No significant arterial-portal venous renin dif-ference was observed. Infusion of exogenous renin decreased the usual renal venous-arterial renin difference; slight net renal inactivation of renin was observed in only 2 of 12 periods. We conclude that the liver is the major site of renin inactivation. ADDITIONAL KEY WORDS angiotensin kidney spleen pancreas <b>chlormerodrin</b> gastrointestinal tract sodium depletion liver function anesthetized dogs B The plasma concentration of renin is de-termined by the relative rates of renin re-lease and inactivation. Yet, to date, {{there have been few}} studies concerned directly with the sites or rate of renin inactivation. The present experiments were designed to in-vestigate this problem by measuring arterio-venous differences for renin across several vascular beds. The word "inactivation " is not meant to connote a specific mechanism, but only to indicate the finding of an arterio-venous difference in renin activity. Methods All experiments were performed on mongrel dogs of either sex, weighing 12 to 20 kg. They were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, 30 mg/kg intravenously, with supplements given as required. All infusions were administered through indwelling venous catheters; arterial blood pres-sure was monitored from a femoral artery. In most dogs, catheters were introduced into a jugular and femoral vein and, through a flank in...|$|E
