40|$|The use of {{tragacanth}} as a {{film coating}} material on rnedici-nal tablets has been investigated in this study. Different methods and materials {{have been used for}} the <b>coating</b> of medicinal <b>tablets.</b> <b>Tablets</b> are <b>coated</b> for various reasons. Some of these are; the ability of coatings to mask unpleasant taste and odor and to pro-tect from atmospheric gases, to control the disintegration site of tablets and provide sustained release action, to prevent incompati-bilities between the ingredients, to facilitate product identifica-tion and to improve product appearance. Because of certain drawbacks of sugar coating, studies on compression and film coating have been carried out. The aim of film coating is to provide coating which disintegrates in the gas-tric or in the intestinal fluid. The subject of our study is film coa-ting which disintegrates in the gastric fluid.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} use of ultra-fast MRI techniques to quantitatively characterise the dissolution process of controlled drug release dosage forms. Implementations and validations of two quantitative single shot RARE based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols are described. Quantitative T 2 (spin-spin relaxation time constant) and diffusion weighted single shot RARE images, both with acquisition time of less than 3 minutes, were achieved by preconditioning the standard RARE sequence with a hard pulse CPMG echo train or an alternating phase bipolar pulsed field gradient spin echo (APGSTE) diffusion sequence respectively. T 2 -preconditoined RARE and diffusion-preconditioned RARE experiments were carried out on 5 phantoms with T 2 values between 29 – 2200 ms. The optimisation of the phase encoding start value (PESV) parameter in the MRI pulse sequence was carried out, and four centric phase encoding schemes were also investigated. Phantoms imaged using the conventional RARE phase encoding scheme under the optimal PESV value of - 0. 2, showed a percentage error difference of 11 % for absolute water concentration (C wat) maps, and an error of 2 % in T 2. Similarly an error of less than 2 % in the molecular self diffusion coefficient (D) was found compared to the corresponding reference value. The two quantitative preconditioned RARE pulse sequences were then used to follow the dissolution of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) in both static and flowing environments.

The present study evaluates the application potential of neem gum, as an aqueous film coating material, using ciprofloxacin hydrchloride (drug) as a model drug. Initial study of physical mixture indicated absence of chemical interaction in between drug and NG. Aqueous coating solution of NG was optimized and consisted of neem gum (13. 34 %w/w), triethyl citrate (1. 25 %w/w), talc (0. 25 %w/w) and titanium dioxide (0. 17 %w/w). The coating parameters such as pan revolutions (rpm), inlet air pressure, inlet temperature, and pan load were optimized. The uncoated and <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> were evaluated for hardness, disintegration time, dissolution, drug content. The <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> were subjected to accelerated stability conditions for 1 month and the results were compared with marketed drug <b>tablet.</b> Any <b>coating</b> defects, except surface roughness, were absent in case of NG <b>coated</b> <b>tablets.</b> NG <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> depicted satisfactory mechanical strength. Dissolution study of NG <b>coated</b> <b>tablets</b> depicted 90 % of drug release in 10 minutes and 100 % of drug release at 30 minutes. Accelerated storage conditions didn’t affect the tablet hardness and % drug release. The coating process efficiency, coating uniformity and loss on drying confirmed that the coating solution was optimum and coating parameters were robust. Industrial relevance. A paradigm shift, from organic solvent-based to water-based film coating of pharmaceutical dosage forms, apparent in pharmaceutical industries, is due to Government regulation, high cost of the organic solvents, safety issues {{associated with the use of}} organic solvents. Currently, the commercially available edible coatings utilize synthetic cellulosic polymers namely, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone, polydextrose. A particular disadvantage of HPMC coating is hardening of the coating over time and thereby prolonged tablet disintegration time. Neem gum is a promising natural, biodegradable, cheap and eco-friendly film former which can be employed for aqueous film <b>coating</b> of <b>tablets,</b> containing bitter taste or moisture sensitive drug. Moreover neem gum is an effective film former in lower concentrations (10 - 15 % w/w) and may be a cost-effective alternative over conventional film formers. Keywords.
