40|$|The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>storing</b> corn in {{the crib}} {{on the farm}} {{is made up of}} three main items, shrink, {{interest}} and insurance, and destruction by vermin. The biggest item <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> is the shrink, or loss of moisture. This amounts to about 10 percent. This shrink, however, is offset or more than offset by the highest price received for the improved grade which results from the shrink. Interest and insurance come to nearly half a cent a bushel a month. It costs half a cent a bushel, therefore, to store corn, if the loss by vermin, or the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> a rat-proof crib, is not included. If it is included, the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>storing</b> corn is a cent a bushel a month. On the average, the price of corn rises from winter to summer· more than enough to cover this cost. After big crops, the price of corn usually rises more than it docs after small crops. After small crops, the price of corn may not rise enough to cover the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>storing.</b> It is advisable, then, to store corn after a big or average crop, but not after a crop 95 percent of average size, or smaller. This rule worked 21 times out of the last 23 years.
