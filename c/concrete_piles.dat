5|$|Due to {{the steep}} slope {{on which the}} {{building}} is situated, {{it had to be}} specially designed out of concrete to fit into its foundations correctly. From the front, the building appears to have only three floors. However, from the rear, all of its six floors can be seen. One part of the building's foundation was made of <b>concrete</b> <b>piles,</b> and the other as a continuous foundation. Usually, these two approaches do not mix well but Horodecki somehow succeeded in overcoming this technical problem.|$|E
5|$|Mandurah {{had grown}} rapidly {{as a tourist}} {{destination}} in the post war period, and on 17 April 1953 a new bridge connecting Old Coast Road to Mandurah was opened. Construction of the new bridge, adjacent to the old bridge, began in September 1951, and was designed with reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>piles.</b> The old wooden bridge had rapidly deteriorated due {{to the presence of}} marine organisms, and needed considerable attention to maintain it in a usable condition. The opening ceremony was attended by the Chairman of the Mandurah Road Board, W. Anderson, Leader of the Opposition, Ross McLarty, Minister for Works, John Tonkin; Commissioner of Main Roads, Digby Leach; C. H. Henning, MLC; engineer in charges of bridges, Ernest Godfrey; local government representatives, and a number of schoolchildren who were given a half-day off school.|$|E

25|$|The geology of the site, {{a former}} farmer's field on a slight slope, {{with a heavy}} clay soil that is subject to {{seasonal}} movements when wet, meant that substantial foundations and drainage had to be constructed. The main support for the above ground structures consists of 210 <b>concrete</b> <b>piles</b> extending vertically downwards into the soil, each up to 7 metres deep. These pilings were engineered in June 2009 by a specialist company, Wig-Palen, from Belgium, using a 62-ton machine to drill and compact the required holes. Concrete was then poured into the hollow drill {{to fill the void}} as the drill was extracted, and steel reinforcement cages were then placed into the still-wet concrete. This screw-piling technique ensured that the cemetery foundations were both end-bearing and friction-bearing in nature, increasing the stability of the pilings and the structures they support.|$|E

25|$|Petre's intention, {{which is}} clear from the almost 90 pages of {{drawings}} held in the diocesan archives, was to design the most impressive cathedral in Australasia. Building began in 1878 and the structure was consecrated in 1886. Its construction is notable for its foundations: 40 massive <b>concrete</b> <b>piles,</b> each over 1.2 metres (four feet) in width, sunk 10 metres (35ft) into the ground, give the cathedral a firm foundation on the volcanic bedrock. The nave is 24 metres (80ft) in length and 16 metres (52ft) in height. The walls are in black basalt with dressings of white Oamaru stone, a combination for which Dunedin and Christchurch architecture is noted (see also Dunedin Railway Station). Petre was later to have two further opportunities for cathedral design, but St. Joseph's remains his largest work in the Gothic style.|$|E
25|$|The {{size of the}} Cross of Sacrifice, a {{standard}} Commission structure used for cemeteries with over 40 graves, varies according {{to the number of}} burials in a cemetery. For this cemetery, a Type-A Cross, around 4 metres wide at the base and 6 metres high, would be used. Carved from Massangies, a French limestone, the shaft of the cross alone would weigh four tonnes, while the entire raised stone terrace would weigh many more tonnes. To support the weight of the Cross and the raised terrace on which it would stand, special foundations of twenty-six vertical 7-metre deep <b>concrete</b> <b>piles</b> were prepared, each capable of supporting ten tonnes, four of which would support the Cross itself. A connecting network was also built between the piles to ensure the load was spread evenly. The raised terrace includes ramps to allow access by wheelchair, and bastions for flower displays.|$|E

The results showed that screening effectiveness of steel pipe piles is generally better than that of solid piles, and that a <b>concrete</b> hollow <b>pile</b> barrier can be ineffective due to its stiffness. The influence of pile length on screening effectiveness is more significant than that of pile spacing and the distance between the vibrating foundation and the pile barrier. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|A {{number of}} civil {{engineering}} structures are constructed of concrete (plain and reinforced). The {{interaction of the}} concrete structure with the surrounding soil often influence some capacity parameters related to the limiting loads, or stress for the structure in question. One of the basic assumption of Terzaghi’s in deriving the bearing capacity equation is “the base of the footing is rough”, to what degree? Other areas of importance are skin friction component of a <b>concrete</b> <b>pile</b> capacity, both driven and bored. For <b>concrete</b> driven <b>pile,</b> the effect of concrete–soil interface properties on estimation of skin frication capacity is reliably well predicted by relevant equations for example Nordlund [1], However, for bored in-situ <b>concrete</b> <b>pile</b> both qualitative and quantitative assumptions are made {{on the influence of}} interface friction. The most common one for a C-∅ soil is the tangent of two-third of internal angle of friction of the soil as the angle of wall friction value for the soil concrete interface. A similar value is assumed in the stability analysis of a retaining wall.|$|R

2500|$|Prefabricated piles {{are driven}} into the ground using a pile driver. Driven piles are either wood, {{reinforced}} concrete, or steel. Wooden piles are made from the trunks of tall trees. <b>Concrete</b> <b>piles</b> are available in square, octagonal, and round cross-sections (like Franki piles). They are reinforced with rebar and are often prestressed. Steel piles are either pipe piles {{or some sort of}} beam section (like an H-pile). Historically, wood piles used splices to join multiple segments end-to-end when the driven depth required was too long for a single pile; today, splicing is common with steel piles, though <b>concrete</b> <b>piles</b> can be spliced with mechanical and other means. Driving piles, as opposed to drilling shafts, is advantageous because the soil displaced by driving the piles compresses the surrounding soil, causing greater friction against the sides of the piles, thus increasing their load-bearing capacity. Driven piles are also considered to be [...] "tested" [...] for weight-bearing ability because of their method of installation; thus the motto of the Pile Driving Contractors' Association is [...] "A Driven Pile...Is a Tested Pile!".|$|E
