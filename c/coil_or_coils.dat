5000|$|Most of {{the work}} to develop coilguns as hyper-velocity {{launchers}} has used [...] "air-cored" [...] systems {{to get around the}} limitations associated with ferromagnetic projectiles. In these systems, the projectile is accelerated by a moving coil [...] "armature". If the armature is configured as one or more [...] "shorted turns" [...] then induced currents will result {{as a consequence of the}} time variation of the current in the static launcher <b>coil</b> (<b>or</b> <b>coils).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{armature}} may be {{a permanent}} magnet, {{in which case the}} <b>coil</b> <b>or</b> <b>coils</b> can exert both repulsive and attractive force on the armature. If there are two coils, they will be wound and connected so that their like poles face each other, so that when (for example) the poles facing the armature are both negative, one pole will attract the armature's south pole while the other will repel its north pole. When the armature reaches the extreme of its movement, polarity to the coils is reversed.|$|E
5000|$|... "Magnetic {{field coil}} power amplifier" [...] — audio {{amplifiers}} of the vacuum-tube era used transformers, incorporating coils of wire, {{to convert the}} high-voltage, low-current output of the output tubes to a low-voltage, high-current output suitable for loudspeakers. Output transformers are no longer necessary with amplifiers, including Carver's, that use transistors. Carver's , first applied in his model M400 power amplifier, describes a power supply whose input switches on and off at an ultrasonic rate {{to adapt to the}} varying power demand of the amplifier. The innovation is in the power supply, not the amplification circuitry, and in the use of switching, not in the use of a <b>coil</b> <b>or</b> <b>coils.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Pickups are {{transducers}} {{attached to}} a guitar that detect (or [...] "pick up") string vibrations and convert the mechanical energy of the string into electrical energy. The resultant electrical signal can then be electronically amplified. The {{most common type of}} pickup is electromagnetic in design. These contain magnets that are tightly wrapped in a <b>coil,</b> <b>or</b> <b>coils,</b> of copper wire. Such pickups are usually placed right underneath the guitar strings. Electromagnetic pickups work on the same principles and in a similar manner to an electrical generator. The vibration of the strings creates a small voltage in the coils surrounding the magnets. This signal voltage is carried to a guitar amplifier that drives a loudspeaker.|$|E
40|$|The {{eddy current}} method of {{nondestructive}} evaluation involves the induction of eddy currents in a conductive test object by a time-varying field {{produced by a}} suitable distribution of impressed currents and the detection of the resultant field. The method is ordinarily used at frequencies sufficiently low to neglect effects due to displacement current; hence a theoretical analysis entails calculating the self-impedance of the coil {{in the presence of}} the test object. In practice, one often needs only the change in impedance produced by the test object or by changes in the nominal properties of the test object (e. g., changes in its geometry or position with respect to the test <b>coil</b> <b>or</b> <b>coils,</b> or distributed or localized changes in the resistivity of the test object) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Distal {{anterior}} {{cerebral artery}} (DACA) aneurysms are less common, accounting for 3. 1 to 9. 2 &#x 0025; of all intracranial aneurysms. The clinical characteristics and surgical techniques are quite {{different from those of}} other aneurysms of Willis circle. Objective: We aimed to investigate the clinical and radiographic characteristics of ruptured distal {{anterior cerebral artery}} (DACA) aneurysms and the efficacy of endovascular treatment for these lesions. Patients and Methods: From 1998 to 2008, 41 patients with 44 DACA aneurysms were treated by endovascular coiling, including parent vessel occlusion using <b>coils</b> <b>or</b> <b>coils</b> combined with n-butyle- 2 -cyanoacrylate (NBCA) in two, endosaccular coiling alone in 39, and stent-assisted coiling in three. Results: Technical success was achieved in 40 (97. 6 &#x 0025;) patients. Among the 41 aneurysms successfully treated with endosaccular <b>coiling</b> <b>or</b> stent-assisted <b>coiling,</b> complete occlusion was obtained in 37, neck remnant in two, and partial occlusion in two. Two patients with poor pretreatment conditions died of cerebral vasospasm. The morbidity was 4. 87 &#x 0025;. One case each of unruptured recurrence and rebleeding were seen in follow-up DSA of 34 patients and MRA in five cases. Conclusion: Our preliminary results show that endovascular treatment for DACA aneurysms is safe and effective.

40|$|Endovascular {{treatment}} of ruptured intracranial aneurysms with detachable coils has proven a favorable alternative to surgical clipping.

To achieve reconstruction of intracranial vessels with preservation of the parent artery, the use of stents has the greatest potential for assisted coil embolization.
