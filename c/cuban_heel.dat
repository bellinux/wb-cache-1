25|$|Cowboy {{boots are}} a {{specific}} style of riding boot which combines function with fashion. They became popular among cowboys {{in the western}} United States during the 19th century. Traditional cowboy boots have a <b>Cuban</b> <b>heel,</b> rounded to pointed toe, high shaft, and, traditionally, no lacing. They are normally made from cowhide leather but may be made from more exotic skins such as ostrich, anaconda, or elephant skins.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 18th century, men's shoes have {{featured}} lower heels than most women's shoes. Some attribute it to Napoleon who disliked high heels; {{others to the}} general trend of minimizing non-functional items in men's clothing. Cowboy boots remain a notable exception, {{and they continue to}} be made with a taller riding heel. The two-inch (5cm) <b>Cuban</b> <b>heel</b> featured in many styles of men's boot derives its heritage from certain Latino roots, most notably various forms of Spanish and Latin American dance, including flamenco, as most recently evidenced by Joaquín Cortés. Cuban heels were first widely popularized by Beatle boots (variant of the Chelsea boot), as worn by the English rock group the Beatles during their introduction to the United States.|$|E
50|$|Heel styles now {{vary from}} the {{original}} French (pyramidal) or point heel which was made most famous by the Aristoc Point Heel design to the Cuban and Havana heels—darkened reinforced heel design finishing in a square top rather than pointed top—the <b>Cuban</b> <b>heel</b> being defined by being much thinner and finishing higher up the calf than the Havana heel.|$|E

50|$|Beatle {{boots are}} tight-fitting, Cuban-heeled, ankle-length boots with a pointed toe. They {{originated}} in 1963 when Brian Epstein discovered Chelsea boots while browsing in the London footwear company Anello & Davide.

50|$|Winklepicker shoes, {{inspired}} by the Poulaines worn by the medieval French nobility, were a conspicuous contrast to the brothel creepers worn by Teddy Boys. The male shoes were lace-up Oxford style with a low heel and an exaggerated pointed toe. A Chelsea Boot style (elastic-sided with a two-inch, and later as much as two-and-one-half-inch, <b>Cuban</b> <b>heel)</b> was notably worn by the Beatles but although it had a pointed toe, was {{not considered to be}} a winklepicker. Winklepicker shoes from Stan's of Battersea were also worn by the Teddy Girls as well as being a fleeting fashion for young women generally.|$|E

60|$|Saxon {{smiled with}} appreciation, pointed out her foot, velvet-slippered with high <b>Cuban</b> <b>heels,</b> and {{slightly}} lifted the tight black skirt, exposing a trim ankle and delicate swell of calf, the white flesh gleaming through the thinnest and flimsiest of fifty-cent black silk stockings. She was slender, not tall, yet the due round lines of womanhood were hers. On her white shirtwaist was a pleated jabot of cheap lace, caught {{with a large}} novelty pin of imitation coral. Over the shirtwaist was a natty jacket, elbow-sleeved, and to the elbows she wore gloves of imitation suede. The one essentially natural touch about her appearance was the few curls, strangers to curling-irons, that escaped from under the little naughty hat of black velvet pulled low over the eyes.|$|R
5000|$|Shake Some Action was {{the first}} album by the newly reconstituted version of the Flamin' Groovies, who had {{returned}} from a five-year hiatus during which lead singer Roy Loney departed the band, leaving guitarist Cyril Jordan as its de facto leader. The band drastically reshaped their musical style, stripping down the blues and rockabilly influences of their previous work {{in favor of a}} more retro, guitar-oriented power pop style emulating that of the 1960s British Invasion scene. The new band took to wearing velvet-collared three-piece suits and <b>Cuban</b> <b>heels</b> in an attempt to recreate the fashion sense of the era.

50|$|Shortly {{before it}} closed a {{recording}} studio was installed on the premises. This was a rather modest affair that was housed in what was essentially a walk in cupboard. The studio was popular with local bands, and clients included Johnny and the Self Abusers who were playing regularly at another Glasgow music pub called The Mars Bar, that featured mainly Punk acts. Johnny and the Self Abusers split up and its members went on to form The <b>Cuban</b> <b>Heels</b> and Simple Minds.With the bands playing in the upstairs lounge there was a resident DJ in the bar area from 1973 onwards. This was called The Pony Express and played rock music to the bar customers. DJ Gordon Elrick also ran theme nights including the popular Tuesday Club where regulars dressed up and mimed to old standards.|$|R

They recorded their eponymous album (which was to be called Building on the Sand before a last minute change) at Rock City, Shepperton in January of 1980. However, before the albums release, Rudden left due to [...] "artistic differences" [...] with Bonomi and McKinven and was replaced firstly by Russell Barrie for a very brief period in one or two gigs (Barrie is seen dressed in pink on the cover of their single [...] "Science") and then by Nick Clark from <b>Cuban</b> <b>Heels</b> (Clark is credited on the album, although it was Rudden who played.)

Read {{was the only}} white player amongst Locke, Derrick Johnson and Rosko Gee, who went onto to become members of Bob Marley's band and Traffic. At this time Read also rehearsed with a rock trio in Pimlico, London, and after one rehearsal, came across Jesse Hector and Alan Butler, ex-mods who arrived to rehearse without a drummer - they jammed and decided to work together, and inside eight weeks got backing and {{management}} from an East End market worker called Graham Breslau. Read {{came up with a}} band name - Crushed Butler - and they recorded a demo at Regent Sound Studios in Denmark Street called 'It's My Life'. The trio played their first gig at the Country Club, West Hampstead, supporting Osibisa. Crushed Butler dressed in hand-cut slash neck red T-shirts, straight legged Levis with studded belts. Hector had short cropped hair with massive mutton chops, Butler had a crop cut centre parting hairdo and large sideburns, Read had a lion's shag of dark hair and continually sported a black leather vintage motorbike jacket, with a blue/white hooped T-shirt and <b>Cuban</b> <b>heels.</b> Altogether their image looked liked the Clash several years before the Clash formed, and Hector's voice sounded like John Lydon only in 1969.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999 McFarlane {{described}} de Castro as a [...] "permanent fixture of the pub/concert/festival {{circuit and}} was praised for his vocal abilities" [...] as [...] "one {{of the best}} soul singers working in Australia" [...] during the 1970s. In a seachange mood, to further demonstrate the diversity of his musical palette, Leo de Castro and the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Heels</b> were formed in Hobart in late 1989, with Steve 'Keys' Grahame on piano/keyboards, Marcus [...] "Piz" [...] Pizzolato (ex Mary Lou and the Brokenhearted) on lead guitar, Mick 'Moonie' McCallum (ex Rainbow Stew) on pedal steel, Simon Gethen (ex Albino Spade/Tim Brewster and the Blues Roosters) on bass, and Dennis Matthews (ex Sydney Clubs/Mary Lou and the Brokenhearted) on drums. This seasoned troupe performed soulful renditions of country songs by George Jones, Hank Williams, Merle Haggard, Gram Parsons and The Flying Burrito Brothers, among many other classic country music greats. In September 2008 de Castro was farewelled from Hobart by Sarah Shofield on [...] "Leo de Castro and Dutch Tilders" [...] episode of ABC Tasmania's radio show, Breakfast with Robbie Buck.

5000|$|Nick Levine from Digital Spy {{positively}} reviewed [...] "Sweet About Me," [...] {{giving it}} {{four out of}} five stars. Levine comended Xenomania's production on the track, calling it [...] "authentic" [...] and [...] "fresh". He also praised Gabriella Cilmi's vocals on the song, [...] "Most impressive of all is Cilmi's voice, which manages to be sweet and coarse all at the same time, much like a drizzling of honey on a slice of toast." [...] Jake Taylor of Sputnikmusic deemed [...] "Sweet About Me" [...] {{as one of the best}} songs released by an Australian artist on debut. He wrote, [...] "A lot of songs focus on the chorus as the returning point for the listener's attention, but 'Sweet About Me' dumps that for a well rounded mix of brilliant singing and layered pop production on all levels." [...] Contactmusic.com complimented [...] "Sweet About Me" [...] saying it brings a little fun back to pop. The song received a {{four out of five}} star rating from Fraser McAlpine of the BBC who compared Cilmi to British singers Amy Winehouse and Duffy, [...] "Perky song, this. Well suited to grabbing your attention even in the middle of the sudden run of post-Winehouse soul sirens, largely because it swings a bit, and seems to have some spark of its own, rather than stiffly wearing its '60s influences like a pair of slightly-too-small <b>cuban</b> <b>heeled</b> boots to that of Duffy." [...] Mark Reid of The New Zealand Herald described the track as [...] "incredibly catchy". The song was classed as an obvious highlight on Lessons to Be Learned by Colin Polonowski of The Digital Fix. Andrew Cock of The Dwarf said that [...] "Sweet About Me" [...] is as catchy as ever and will continue to receive wide public acclaim. Cock noted, [...] "At times this song seems so sweet it oozes honey, feeling deliberately boppy." [...] Cilmi's vocal performance on the song was praised by Paul Cashmere of Undercover FM, [...] "From the sultry opening notes of the debut single 'Sweet About Me', the world will quickly come to know it's uncovered a major new vocal talent in Gabriella Cilmi." ...|$|R
