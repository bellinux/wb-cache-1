40|$|Abstract The paper {{presents}} {{results for}} the speciation analysis of lead in dusts derived from dedusting of technological gasses from metallurgical processes of non-ferrous metals with different elementary content, made in accordance with two equal sequential extractions. Analytical procedure A provided possibilities for determination of fraction of Pb 2 +, metallic lead and fraction <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>lead</b> sulfides. The second procedure (procedure B) was sequential extraction in accordance with Tessier. The results obtained in accordance with procedure A indicate that, regardless of the dust origin, the dominant group of Pb compounds is composed of lead salts which are soluble under alkaline conditions or lead compounds that form plumbites in the reaction with NaOH...|$|E

40|$|Electric Arc Furnace Dust (EAFD) is an {{industrial}} waste obtained as {{a by-product of}} the stainless steel manufacturing industry. It <b>contains</b> heavy metals, <b>mainly</b> <b>lead</b> (Pb), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) and hence, has been listed as a hazardous waste under the code of 10 02 07 * in the European Waste Catalogue. In the UK, the Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) has been introduced under the Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations in July 2005. The recent amendment in the UK Landfill Regulations meant that all hazardous wastes have to be pre-treated prior to landfill disposal. Therefore, according to the WAC, EAFD waste has to be pre-treated prior to disposal due to mainly the leaching potential of heavy metals it contains. Various technologies {{have been used to}} pre-treat hazardous wastes prior to landfill disposal. Solidification/Stabilization (S/S) is one technique that has been demonstrated to have potential for the treatment and possible reuse {{of a wide range of}} hazardous wastes. It mainly aims to reduce the mobility of the waste and hence reduce the leachability of pollutants of concern. S/S products can either be disposed of in landfill after pre-treatment or might be reused in the construction industry depending on the structure and chemical characteristics of the final products. Consequently, the aim of this study is two-folds; (1) to evaluate and determine the optimum process conditions for a final product that not only complies with the WAC but has also potential for reuse; (2) evaluate the potential of using cost-effective alternative materials for cement replacemen...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of bimetallic silver-cobalt clusters {{with less than}} 50 atoms is studied experimentally and their associated geometries are predicted by classical modeling. The clusters are created by laser vaporization and inert gas condensation. Their mass distribution is analyzed with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. For clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> silver, we find strong quantum size effects related to itinerant behavior of the silver and cobalt valence electrons. In the case of clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> cobalt, no pronounced size effects appear in the mass spectra. Photofragmentation experiments reveal that neutral silver atom evaporation is the favorable channel, suggesting that the Ag{single bond}Co bonds are weaker than the Co{single bond}Co bonds. Consistently, and for both sets of clusters, Metropolis Monte-Carlo simulations predict these clusters to have icosahedral based structures that may depend on temperature. In clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> silver, cobalt sits at the cluster center and fragmentation proceeds by the evaporation of silver surface atoms. In clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> cobalt, silver atoms also locate at the periphery and are more weakly bound to the cluster than cobalt surface atoms. © 2006 Elsevier B. V.
