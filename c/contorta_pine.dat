These changes may to alter natural ecosystems dependent on historical and current climate conditions. Increasing mountain pine beetle (MBP) outbreaks within the southern Sierra Nevada are the result of these alterations. This study better understands MPB behavior within Sequoia National Park (SNP) and model its current and future habitat distribution. Variables contributing to MPB spread are vegetation stress, soil moisture, temperature, precipitation, disturbance, and presence of Ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa) and Lodgepole (Pinus <b>contorta)</b> <b>pine</b> trees. These variables were obtained using various modeled, insitu, and remotely sensed sources. The generalized additive model (GAM) was used to calculate the statistical significance of each variable contributing to MPB spread and also created maps identifying habitat suitability. Results indicate vegetation stress and forest disturbance to be variables most indicative of MPB spread. Additionally, the model was able to detect habitat suitability of MPB with a 45 % accuracy concluding that a geospatial driven modeling approach can be used to delineate potential MPB spread within SNP...|$|E

The ecophysiological impacts of this practice on tree saplings remain poorly understood. In this study, I examined the physiological and morphological impacts of increased light intensity, due to post-fire salvage logging, on the conifer Pinus <b>contorta</b> (<b>pine)</b> and deciduous broadleaf Salix lucida (willow) tree and shrub species in the Crowsnest Pass region of southern Alberta. Photosynthetic gas-exchange and plant morphological measurements were taken throughout the summer of 2013 on approximately ten year-old saplings of both species. Neither species exhibited photoinhibition, but different strategies were observed to acclimate to increased light availability. Willow saplings were able to slightly elevate their light-saturated rate of net photosynthesis (Amax) when exposed to higher photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), thus increasing their growth rate. Willow also exhibited increased leaf inclination angles and leaf mass per unit area (LMA), to decrease light interception in the salvage-logged plot. By contrast, pine, which exhibited lower Amax and transpiration (E), but higher water-use efficiency (WUE = Amax/E) than willow, increased {{the rate at which}} electrons were moved through and away from the photosynthetic apparatus in order to avoid photoinhibition. Acclimation indices were higher in willow saplings, consistent with the hypothesis that species with short-lived foliage exhibit greater acclimation. LMA was higher in pine saplings growing in the logged plot, but whole-plant and branch-level morphological acclimation was limited and more consistent with a response to decreased competition in the logged plot, which had much lower stand density.

40|$|Abstract Molecular genetic {{methods were}} used to de-termine whether {{artificial}} defoliation affects ectomycor-rhizal (EM) colonization, EM fungal species richness, and species composition in a mixed Pinus <b>contorta</b> (lodgepole <b>pine)</b> /Picea engelmannii (Engelmann spruce) forest in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. All lodgepole pines in three replicate plots were defoliated 50 %, while Engelmann spruce were left untreated. This was done to determine how defoliation of one conifer species would affect EM mutualisms of both treated and neighboring, untreated conifers. The results indicated no significant effect on either EM colonization (142. 0 EM tips/core in control plots and 142. 4 in treatment plots) or species richness (5. 0 species/core in controls and 4. 5 in treatments). However, the relative abundance of EM of the two tree species shifted from a ratio of approximately 6 : 1 without treatment (lodgepole EM:spruce EM), to a near 1 : 1 ratio post-treatment. This shift may be responsi-ble for maintaining total EM colonization and species richness following defoliation. In addition, EM species composition changed significantly post-defoliation; the system dominant, an Inocybe species, was rare in defoli-ation plots, while Agaricoid and Suilloid species that were rare in controls were dominant in treatments. Fur-thermore, species of EM fungi associating with both lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce were affected, which indicates that changing the photosynthetic capaci-ty of one species can affect mycorrhizal associations of neighboring non-defoliated trees...|$|R
40|$|Foliar {{moisture}} content {{is an important}} factor regulating how wildland fires ignite in and spread through live fuels but {{moisture content}} determination methods are rarely standardised between studies. One such difference lies between the uses of rapid moisture analysers or drying ovens. Both of these methods are commonly used in live fuel research but they have never been systematically compared to ensure that they yield similar results. Here we compare the foliar moisture content of Pinus <b>contorta</b> (lodgepole <b>pine)</b> at multiple sites for an entire growing season determined using both oven-drying and rapid moisture analyser methods. We found that moisture contents derived from the rapid moisture analysers were nearly identical to oven-dried moisture contents (R 2 = 0. 99, n = 68) even though the rapid moisture analysers dried samples at 145 °C v. oven-drying at 95 °C. Mean absolute error between oven-drying and the rapid moisture analysers was low at 2. 6 % and bias was 0. 62 %. Mean absolute error was less than the within-sample variation of an individual moisture determination method and error was consistent across the range of moisture contents measured. These results suggest that live fuel moisture values derived from either of these two methods are interchangeable and it also suggests that drying temperatures used in live fuel moisture content determination may be less important than reported by other studies...|$|R
40|$|In north-west Canada, Pinus <b>contorta</b> (lodgepole <b>pine)</b> {{has been}} {{migrating}} northwards and westwards for millennia. Its regeneration is currently enhanced by fire, which may {{act as a}} trigger for local population expansion. Using Holocene charcoal records from four small ( 4000 ?years after the first local appearance of Pinus, suggesting {{a long period of}} stasis at low densities. Population increases – based on pollen accumulation rates (PARs) – occurred at different times at the four sites. Estimated expansion periods were ~ 2500 – 800 ?years, and population doubling times were ~ 150 – 600 ?years, similar to previous estimates. Estimated fire return intervals (FRIs) fluctuated over time. At all sites, the Pinus expansion began during a phase with a relatively short FRI, but only one difference between the mean FRIs before and during the Pinus rise was statistically distinguishable. Nor was the subsequent higher abundance of pine associated with shorter FRIs. It is unlikely that regional pine expansion is primarily linked to changes in climate or a climate-mediated fire regime, although expansion may have been triggered at individual sites during a period of high fire frequency. The long period of stasis at low population densities suggests intrinsic control of population growth; possibly Pinus expansion was initially constrained by lowered reproductive fitness (Allee effect) and/or interaction with local site-based factor...|$|R

This was a follow-up study to another LCI study conducted for Pacific Northwest softwood lumber and southern pine lumber (Milota 2004; Milota et al. 2004; Milota et al. 2005).

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about how foliar {{moisture}} and chemistry change after a mountain pine beetle attack and even less is known about how these intrinsic foliar characteristics alter foliage ignitability. Here, we examine the fuel characteristics and ignition potential of Pinus <b>contorta</b> (lodgepole <b>pine)</b> foliage during the early stages of a mountain pine beetle attack. Foliar samples were taken periodically from multiple trees identified as green (healthy, unattacked), recently attacked, or red (dead). The fuel moisture con- tent, chemical composition, and time to ignition of needles from each attack category were quantified. Foliar moisture contents varied by an order of magnitude between the attack categories and were lowest for red needles (� 12 % on average), highest for green needles (� 109 % on average), and most variable for needles of recently attacked trees. Dry matter proportions of fiber in the needles of attacked and red trees were nearly twice that of green needles. Starch and sugar levels were much lower in the needles of attacked and red trees than green trees. Crude fat contents also differed between the attack categories. Time to ignition was strongly related to time since beetle attack. Ignition times varied from as little as 11 s for red needles to 41 s for green needles. A combined model of foliar moisture content, fiber, and crude fat explained 92 % of the variation in the foliar time to ignition. Results show that decreased mois- ture contents and changes in foliar chemistry increase the foliar flammability of mountain pine beetle- attacked trees. This suggests that less heat would be required to ignite the foliage of attacked trees and thus crown fire potential may be higher in attacked stands as long as foliage is retained on the tree.

The idea came {{from the fact that the}} Swedish government is evaluating a notification from the National Forest Agency that suggests lodgepole pine to be allowed for commercial plantation even in southern Sweden. Two experimental sites have been visited, one in Östergötland and one in Småland. At the sites measurements were taken in two provenances of lodgepole pine and in one of Scots pine. Based on the measurements calculations were made with five functions created by Elfving & Norgren (1993). The calculations showed that lodgepole pine grows better than Scots pine on both locations but the differences are greater on locations with harsh climate conditions. Of the two provenances of lodgepole pine, the southernmost had the largest basal area and the largest standing volume on both sites. The Scots pine had suffered damage from various agents on the site in Småland and the comparisons between the species were not reliable at that location. Besides the measurements, seven different quality indicators were classified subjectively. Deviations from straightness were higher for Scots pine than lodgepole pine on both locations. Based on this study, lodgepole pine seems to be well adapted to be used as a complement to the native Scots pine on poor soil and locations with harsher climate conditions even in Götaland.

All six species established from seed on tephra deposits less than 20 cm deep. Cultivation of the tephra surface crust yielded more established seedlings than either total removal of tephra deposit or untreated tephra. Where differences between species were significant, Pseudotsuga menziesii was tallest and Tsuga heterophylla the shortest of the species tested. Seedlings grown on tephra were generally shorter than those grown on underlying soil, regardless of surface treatment. The principal factors affecting establishment in this study were: 1) loss of seed prior to germination, 2) failure of germinating seeds to penetrate the tephra surface crust, and 3) the occurrence of extended drought and/or extreme surface temperatures...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports the}} results from a 5  year {{simulation}} of forest thinning intended to reduce fire hazard on publicly managed lands in the western United States. A state simulation model of interrelated timber markets {{was used to evaluate}} the timber product outputs. Approximately 84  million acres (34  million hectares), or 66 % of total timberland in the western United States, is publicly managed; of this 78  million acres (31. 6  million hectares) are managed by the federal agencies. We considered three budget scenarios using a least-expensive highest-hazard area first policy. Our intention with this simulation is not to definitively answer questions about where or how to conduct treatments to reduce fire hazard on public lands but rather to begin to develop tools {{that can be used to}} inform such a policy debate. Considerable development of this tool is still needed before it will be useful for that purpose. Our initial simulations nonetheless provide insight into what might happen if available funds were allocated to the least-expensive highest-hazard areas across the west. Using assumptions of (1) an annual "subsidy" (payments for treatments), (2) the treatment costs, (3) the priority ranking by forest type, (4) fire hazard level, and (5) the wildland-urban interface (WUI) status, the simulation suggests that lodgepole <b>pine</b> (Pinus <b>contorta),</b> ponderosa <b>pine</b> (Pinus ponderosa), spruce (Picea spp.) -fir (Abies spp.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) are projected to be major forest types treated in the West. A combination of our treatment ranking assumptions and the low total treatable WUI acres on public timberland caused the model to concentrate almost exclusively on all the WUI stands and non-WUI ponderosa pine forest type at the budget of $ 150  million and $ 300  million. With the further increase of budget, a large proportion of treated acres are lodgepole pine and spruce-fir forest types using the thin-from-below approach. About 41 % of the volume removals are sawtimber for all the public timberland treated under the low budget scenario ($ 150  million/year), 58 for moderate budget ($ 300  million/year), 50 for the high budget scenario ($ 1500  million/year). Under the moderate budget case ($ 300  million a year), about 19 % of the total wood removed is projected to come from trees less than 5 -inches (12. 7  cm) in diameter at breast height (dbh), and another 16 % of the biomass is expected from trees 20 -inches (50. 8  cm) dbh and above. ...|$|R
