50|$|Cobalt(II) {{hydroxide}} or <b>cobaltous</b> <b>hydroxide</b> is the {{inorganic compound}} with the formula Co(OH)2. It is a rose-red powder. An unstable blue form, so-called Î±-Co(OH)2, {{has also been}} reported. It is most used as a drying agent for paints, varnishes, and inks, {{in the preparation of}} other cobalt compounds, as a catalyst and in the manufacture of battery electrodes.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to prepare spherical cobalt powder of about 400 nm from aqueous <b>cobaltous</b> <b>hydroxide</b> slurry under hydrogen reduction conditions using palladium chloride as a catalyst. The reduction kinetics showed good agreement with a surface reaction core model equation, and the activation energy of 35. 6 kJ/mol {{was obtained from the}} Arrhenius plot at the temperature range of 145 - 195 degreesC. Additionally, a relationship between the half-life of the reduction, the induction period, and the hydrogen gas pressure was found to be as t(1 / 2) - t(i) = aP(H 2) (1 -n).
