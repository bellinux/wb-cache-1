50|$|This mineral is {{generally}} found in tin-rich <b>contact</b> <b>metamorphic</b> skarn <b>deposits.</b> There {{is a possibility}} that malayaite is a hydrothermal altered form of cassiterite-quartz assemblage or some tin-bearing mineral.

50|$|Bornite is an {{important}} copper ore mineral and occurs widely in porphyry copper deposits along with the more common chalcopyrite. Chalcopyrite and bornite are both typically replaced by chalcocite and covellite in the supergene enrichment zone of copper deposits. Bornite is also found as disseminations in mafic igneous rocks, in <b>contact</b> <b>metamorphic</b> skarn <b>deposits,</b> in pegmatites and in sedimentary cupriferous shales. It is important as an ore for its copper content of about 63 percent by mass.|$|R
50|$|The first {{commercial}} copper mining district in Nevada was at Yerington in Lyon County. The Ludwig Mine opened in 1865, but the district produced only modest amounts of copper until a railroad {{was built to}} the district in 1911, and a smelter built in 1912 at nearby Thompson. The Anaconda Copper Mine produced from an open pit from 1918 to 1978. The copper ore bodies are <b>contact</b> <b>metamorphic</b> replacement <b>deposits</b> in limestone. Production through 1921 was 39 thousand tonnes of copper.|$|R
50|$|Chrysoberyl {{can also}} {{grow in the}} country rocks near to {{pegmatite}}s, when Be- and Al-rich fluids from the pegmatite react with surrounding minerals. Hence, {{it can be found}} in mica schists and in <b>contact</b> with <b>metamorphic</b> <b>deposits</b> of dolomitic marble. Because it is a hard, dense mineral that is resistant to chemical alteration, it can be weathered out of rocks and deposited in river sands and gravels in alluvial deposits with other gem minerals such as diamond, corundum, topaz, spinel, garnet, and tourmaline. When found in such placers, it will have rounded edges instead of sharp, wedge-shape forms. Much of the chrysoberyl mined in Brazil and Sri Lanka is recovered from placers, as the host rocks have been intensely weathered and eroded.|$|R
