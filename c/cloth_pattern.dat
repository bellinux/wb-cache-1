40|$|Apparel CAD {{systems are}} {{required}} to generate virtual wear simulation before a garment is actually made to visualize the wear effects. The natural shapes of garments are determined by three main factors: mechanical properties of fabric materials, geometrical and topological shapes of 2 D <b>cloth</b> <b>patterns</b> and {{the shape of a}} human body. In this paper, we focus on simulation of cloth mechanical behavior and its interaction with human body during contact. By taking a flared skirt as an example, we visualize the draping, fitting and pressure distribution in apparel design. The simulation starts with 2 D patterns that are arranged around a body. Undergoing sewing, the patterns are brought together along seam lines and then form a draped shape. During the sewing and draping, the motion of <b>cloth</b> <b>patterns</b> is governed by a number of mechanical equations. The comparison of the simulated skirts and the actual ones confirms the simulation accuracy. Moreover, the visualized distributions of various stresses reveal the effect of fabric anisotropy. The visualized pressure on human body show distributions that are related to contact between body and garment and can be useful for apparel mechanical functional design.

40|$|ABSTRACT:- Computer-aided cloth {{design is}} one of the quite popular {{research}} themes in recent years, and the authenticity of it’s simulated result and the efficiency of simulation are two main research questions. The cloth behavior not only determines the authenticity of simulation, but also influences the efficiency of simulation. So 3 D virtual clothing is simulated and rendered by the way of 2 D patterning technique in this study. In this method, the outlines of 2 D cloth patterns are first drawn with B-spline curve, and the cloth particles on the <b>cloth</b> <b>pattern</b> are then created. A logical method is used to construct the particles’ interrelations and triangular meshes on the <b>cloth</b> <b>pattern,</b> such that the established 2 D cloth patterns can be used in the 3 D simulation. Finally the 3 D virtual cloth is simulated by an approximate implicit method. Through the proposed method, not only the simulation result which accord with the fabric behavior of the cloth can be gotten, but also the feeling of different cloth and improvement the authenticity of the cloth can be presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} of realistic characters {{has become increasingly}} important {{to the production of}} blockbuster films, TV series and computer games. The outfit of character {{plays an important role in}} the application of virtual characters. It is one of the key elements reflects the personality of character. Virtual clothing refers to the process that constructs outfits for virtual characters, and currently, it is widely used in mainly two areas, fashion industry and computer animation. In fashion industry, virtual clothing technology is an effective tool which creates, edits and pre-visualises cloth design patterns efficiently. However, using this method requires lots of tailoring expertises. In computer animation, geometric modelling methods are widely used for cloth modelling due to their simplicity and intuitiveness. However, because of the shortage of tailoring knowledge among animation artists, current existing cloth design patterns can not be used directly by animation artists, and the appearance of cloth depends heavily on the skill of artists. Moreover, geometric modelling methods requires lots of manual operations. This tediousness is worsen by modelling same style cloth for different characters with different body shapes and proportions. This thesis addresses this problem and presents a new virtual clothing method which includes automatic character measuring, automatic <b>cloth</b> <b>pattern</b> adjustment, and cloth patterns assembling. There are two main contributions in this research. Firstly, a geodesic curvature flow based geodesic computation scheme is presented for acquiring length measurements from character. Due to the fast growing demand on usage of high resolution character model in animation production, the increasing number of characters need to be handled simultaneously as well as improving the reusability of 3 D model in film production, the efficiency of modelling cloth for multiple high resolution character is very important. In order to improve the efficiency of measuring character for cloth fitting, a fast geodesic algorithm that has linear time complexity with a small bounded error is also presented. Secondly, a <b>cloth</b> <b>pattern</b> adjusting genetic algorithm is developed for automatic cloth fitting and retargeting. For the reason that that body shapes and proportions vary largely in character design, fitting and transferring cloth to a different character is a challenging task. This thesis considers the cloth fitting process as an optimization procedure. It optimizes both the shape and size of each <b>cloth</b> <b>pattern</b> automatically, the integrity, design and size of each <b>cloth</b> <b>pattern</b> are evaluated in order to create 3 D cloth for any character with different body shapes and proportions while preserve the original cloth design. By automating the cloth modelling process, it empowers the creativity of animation artists and improves their productivity by allowing them to use a large amount of existing cloth design patterns in fashion industry to create various clothes and to transfer same design cloth to characters with different body shapes and proportions with ease...|$|E

In this thesis work, we propose an easy-to-use and inexpensive system that facilitates 3 -D articulated user-input using the hands, enabling new user-interfaces and applications.

Internally, the system generates 2 D <b>cloth</b> <b>pattern</b> and shows the 3 D model {{as a result of}} applying simple simulation to the pattern. We introduce Plushie, an interactive system that allows nonprofessional users to design their own original plush toys. To design a plush toy, one needs to construct an appropriate two-dimensional (2 D) pattern. However, it is difficult for non-professional users to appropriately design a 2 D pattern. Some recent systems automatically generate a 2 D pattern for a given three-dimensional (3 D) model, but constructing a 3 D model is itself a challenge. Furthermore, an arbitrary 3 D model cannot necessarily be realized as a real plush toy, and the final sewn result can be very different from the original 3 D model. We avoid this mismatch by constructing appropriate 2 D patterns and applying simple physical simulation to it on the fly during 3 D modeling. In this way, the model on the screen is always a good approximation of the final sewn result, which makes the design process much more efficient. We use a sketching interface for 3 D modeling and also provide various editing operations tailored for plush toy design. Internally, the system constructs a 2 D <b>cloth</b> <b>pattern</b> {{in such a way that}} the simulation result matches the user’s input stroke. Our goal is to show that relatively simple algorithms can provide fast, satisfactory results to the user whereas the pursuit of optimal layout and simulation accuracy lies outside this paper’s scope.

40|$|Overview We {{present a}} method for {{capturing}} the geometry and parameterization of fast-moving cloth using multiple video cameras, without requiring camera calibration. Our cloth is printed with a multi-scale pattern that allows capture at both high speed and high spatial resolution even though self-occlusion might block any individual camera from seeing {{the majority of the}} cloth. We show how to incorporate knowledge of this pattern into conventional structurefrom-motion approaches, and use a novel scheme for camera calibration using the pattern. We use bundle adjustment to obtain accurate reconstruction results and use the parameterization to drive several stages of post processing including strain reduction and a cloth simulation to fill in gaps. We demonstrate our algorithm by capturing, retexturing and displaying several sequences of fast moving <b>cloth.</b> <b>Pattern</b> Selection Our cloth is printed with a pattern that contain...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} design an {{original}} plush toy, {{one needs to}} construct an appropriate 2 D pattern. However, {{it is difficult for}} ordinary people to design 2 D pattern appropriately. Therefore existing patterns for plush toys or balloon have been designed by professional designers. To help people to design their own original plush toys, we are developing two systems for pattern design. The first system, Pillow, starts with an existing 3 D model and lets the user interactively specify segmentation boundaries by drawing seam lines on the model surface. Given the user-defined segmentation, the system generates 2 D patterns by flattening the pieces. The system then visualizes the shape of the resulting plush toy by applying a simple physics simulation. This closed loop interaction allows the user to experiment with various seam line designs without actually sawing a real fabric. The second system, Plushie, is a tool for desinging an original plush toy from scratch using a sketch-based modeling interface under physical constraints. The resulting model is always associated with a 2 D <b>cloth</b> <b>pattern</b> and thus the user can generate a model that is guaranteed to be realizable as a plush toy. These two systems make the construction of 2 D patterns easier and enable the user to design his or her own original plush toys. We introduce some results of sawing plush toys and balloon.
