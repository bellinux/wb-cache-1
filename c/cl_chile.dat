40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a comparison between the characteristics of two public Web spaces: the pages under the. KR (South Korea) domain, and the pages under the. <b>CL</b> (<b>Chile)</b> domain. We show several similarities that contribute to validate more general models for the characteristics of the Web, specially in terms of link structure. The key findings are: • We downloaded 4. 7 million pages from the. kr (Korea) domain and 3. 2 million pages from the. <b>cl</b> (<b>Chile)</b> domain. • Domains in Korea host on average 6 Web sites each, while in Chile, a domain has on average only 1. 1 Web sites. • Korean Web sites have almost 4 times as many pages as Chilean Web sites. • Chilean Web pages are about 50 % larger than Korean pages. • The most used technology in Korea for dynamic pages is ASP, and in Chile, PHP. • There is a strong preference of Microsoft formats for audio and video in the Korean Web. • The distribution of links in terms of in-degree and out-degree for both collections are nearly the same...|$|E

Traditionally the city of Buenos Aires and various municipalities choose their own [...] "Municipal" [...] champions who get wildcards into the final rounds. The same wildcard advantage is also given to national or regional champions of recognized competitions; in 2015 these include Uruguay (UY), <b>Chile</b> (<b>CL),</b> Brazil (Rio de Janeiro, BR), USA (US), Russia (RU), China (CN), Tokyo (JP), Seoul (KR), France (Paris, FR), United Kingdom (London, UK), EU (Italy).|$|R

Department of Biological Sciences, Biorganic Chemistry Laboratory, Universidad de Talca, casilla 747, Talca, <b>Chile,</b> <b>CL.</b> Nothofagus obliqua (roble blanco), Nothofagus glauca (roble colorado), Lithraea Caustica (litre), Quillaja saponaria (quillay) and Cryptocarya alba (peumo), {{classified}} as hardwood species, {{were subjected to}} chemical and spectroscopic analysis. A high extinction coefficient at 280 [*]nm correlates with the high free phenolic group content of the lignins of these species. Nothofagus glauca exhibited a high methoxyl content (19. 3 %) and the lower phenolic content (1. 38 %). The chemiluminescent behaviour of these lignins {{was found to be}} directly proportional to phenolic groups content and inversely proportional to the methoxyl content...|$|R

The Association adopted {{the goals of the}} World Association of Medical Editors (WAME) and therefore it will foster "cooperation and communication among Editors of Chilean biomedical journals; to improve editorial standards, to promote professionalism in medical editing through education, self-criticism and self-regulation; and to encourage research on the principles and practice of medical editing". Twenty nine journals covering a closely similar number of different biomedical sciences, medical specialties, veterinary, dentistry and nursing, became Founding Members of the Association. A Governing Board was elected: President: Humberto Reyes, M. D. (Editor, Revista Médica de Chile); Vice-President: Mariano del Sol, M. D. (Editor, Revista Chilena de Anatomía); Secretary: Anna María Prat (CONICYT); Councilors: Manuel Krauskopff, Ph. D. (Editor, Biological Research) and Maritza Rahal, M. D. (Editor, Revista de Otorrinolaringología y Cirugía de Cabeza y Cuello). The Association will organize a Symposium on Biomedical Journal Editing and will spread information stimulating Chilean biomedical journals to become indexed in international databases and in SciELO-Chile, the main Chilean scientific website (www. scielo. <b>cl)</b> (Rev Méd <b>Chile</b> 2001; 129 : 95 - 98...|$|R
