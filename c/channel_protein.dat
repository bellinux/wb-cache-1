5|$|Genetic {{mutations}} in the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit (Cav1.1) {{have been described}} in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in the genes coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium <b>channel</b> <b>protein</b> type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E

25|$|As with sodium channels, the {{potassium}} channels {{have their}} own toxins that block <b>channel</b> <b>protein</b> action. An {{example of such a}} toxin is the large cation, tetraethylammonium (TEA), but it is notable that the toxin does not have the same mechanism of action on all potassium channels, given the variety of channel types across species. The presence of potassium channels was first identified in Drosophila melanogaster mutant flies that shook uncontrollably upon anesthesia due to problems in cellular repolarization that led to abnormal neuron and muscle electrophysiology. Potassium channels were first identified by manipulating molecular genetics (of the flies) instead of performing <b>channel</b> <b>protein</b> purification because there were no known high-affinity ligands for potassium channels (such as TEA) at the time of discovery.|$|E

40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that adult canine ventricular myocytes express three distinct gap junction <b>channel</b> <b>proteins,</b> connexin 40 (Cx 40), connexin 43 (Cx 43), and connexin 45 (Cx 45). These proteins have unique cytoplasmic domains that likely confer connexin-specific physiological properties. To {{determine whether the}} three distinct <b>channel</b> <b>proteins</b> are distributed in identical or different populations of gap junctions, we performed double-label immunofluorescence on disaggregated canine ventricular myocytes incubated simultaneously with a mouse monoclonal anti-Cx 43 and affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies against Cx 40 or Cx 45. Analysis of double-labeled cardiac myocytes using laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed virtually identical patterns of immunoreactivity for both the Cx 43 ICx 40 and Cx 43 ICx 45 pairs. Double-label immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that ultrastructurally identified cardiac myocyte gap junctions contain multiple <b>channel</b> <b>proteins.</b> Thus, three <b>channel</b> <b>proteins</b> colocalize in canine cardiac myocyte gap junctions. The presence of multiple functionally distinct connexins suggests complex possibilities regarding the composition of individual channels and the regulation of intercellular coupling.

40|$|Cell {{migration}} {{is an important}} cell physiological process, which is among others controlled by regulated ion channel activity. It was revealed that potassium channels, in particular calcium-activated potassium channels (KCa 3. 1), are required for optimal cell migration. In order to study the dynamics of individual <b>channel</b> <b>proteins</b> in the plasma membrane, single <b>channel</b> <b>proteins</b> were identified and tracked during cell migration. The identification was based on dual-colour labeling with quantum dots (QD) and it was proven that more than 90 % of the observed QDs correspond to single potassium <b>channel</b> <b>proteins.</b> In migrating MDCK-F cells (Ncells = 10) single QD-labeled channels (NQD = 534) were visualised and tracked using time lapse total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Analysis of the trajectories of hKCa 3. 1 channels allowed the classification of their dynamics. KCa 3. 1 <b>channel</b> <b>proteins</b> moved subdiffusively in the plasma membrane with a mean diffusion coefficient Dα = 0. 0673 ± 0. 0005 μm 2 /sα and a mean subdiffusion exponent α = 0. 824 ± 0. 003.

25|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF, mucoviscidosis) is {{a genetic}} disease with increased viscosity of various secretions leading to organ failure of lung, pancreas and other organs. It is caused {{in nearly all}} cases by a deletion of phenylalanine 508 of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). This mutation causes a maturation defect of this ion <b>channel</b> <b>protein</b> with increased degradation, mediated by HSPs. Deletion of the co-chaperone AHA1 (activator of heat shock 90kDa protein ATPase homolog 1) leads to stabilization of CFTR and opens up a perspective for a new therapy.|$|E
25|$|Aconitine binds to the {{receptor}} at the neurotoxin {{binding site}} 2 on the alpha-subunit of the <b>channel</b> <b>protein.</b> This binding {{results in a}} sodium-ion channel that stays open longer. Aconitine suppresses the conformational change in the sodium-ion channel from the active state to the inactive state. The membrane stays depolarized due to the constant sodium influx (which is 10-1000 fold greater than the potassium efflux). As a result, the membrane cannot be repolarized. The binding of aconitine to the channel also leads to the channel to change conformation from the inactive state to the active state at a more negative voltage.|$|E
25|$|The CLCN2 gene encodes a {{chloride}} <b>channel</b> <b>protein</b> that {{is heavily}} expressed in brain regions inhibited by GABA. It {{is believed to}} be important in maintaining a proper chloride reversal potential needed in inhibitory neurotransmission by GABA. There are three known mutations in CLCN2 associated with JME, M200fsX231, 74_117del, and G715E. Neither the M200fsX231 nor the 74_117del mutation yield current when expressed in cells. Since these channels are responsible for the removal of intracellular chloride, these mutations are expected to lead to increased chloride concentrations and, thus, altered chloride reversal potential (ECl). As chloride is conducted through the normally inhibitory GABA receptors, this alteration in ECl may lead to either decreased GABAergic currents or GABAergic currents that are actually excitatory. The G715E mutation, on the other hand, produces normal sized currents but has altered voltage dependent activation. For this mutant, activation occurs at more positive potentials compared to wild-type channels. This may cause increased neuronal excitability.|$|E

2500|$|Sodium {{channels}} {{were the}} first voltage-gated ion channels to be isolated in 1984 from the eel Electrophorus electricus by Shosaku Numa. The pufferfish toxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), a sodium channel blocker, was used to isolate the sodium <b>channel</b> <b>protein</b> by binding it using the column chromatography technique for chemical separation.

Most ion <b>channel</b> <b>proteins</b> are oligomeric complexes with the conductive pore located at the central subunit interface. The long-term activity of many K+ <b>channel</b> <b>proteins</b> is dependent on the concentration of extracellular K+; however, the mechanism is unclear. Thus, this project focused on mechanisms underlying structural stability of tetrameric K+ channels. Using KcsA of Streptomyces lividans as a model K+ channel of known structure, the molecular basis of tetramer stability was investigated by: 1. Bioinformatic analysis of the tetramer interface. 2. Effect of two local anesthetics (lidocaine, tetracaine) on tetramer stability. 3. Molecular simulation of drug docking to the ion conduction pore. The results provide new insights regarding the structural stability of K+ channels and its possible role in cell physiology...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, {{a great deal of}} {{attention}} has been focused on discovering the protein partners that form mechanoelectrical transduction (MeT) channels in somatic mechanoreceptors. Two classes of ion <b>channel</b> <b>proteins</b> are leading candidates: amiloride-sensitive channel (ASCs) and transient receptor potential (TRP) <b>channel</b> <b>proteins.</b> Here, we surveyed the literature to establish that most, if not all mechanoreceptor neurons in mice express multiple ASC and TRP <b>channel</b> <b>proteins.</b> But, the landscape of ion channel co-expression in mechanoreceptor neurons is only beginning to be mapped. Future work aimed at refining such maps for mammalian mechanoreceptor neurons will be critical for deeper understanding. Also, each of these potential MeT channel subunits operates within a large company of other ion channel actors that increase the complexity, flexibility, and robustness of somatosensory neuron function. Recently, two additional classes of membrane proteins (Piezo and TMC) have been linked to mechano-transduction. This situation is likely to exist in other mechanoreceptor neurons, including those responsible for touch and pain sensation in mammals...|$|R
2500|$|Also {{known as}} ionotropic receptors, {{this group of}} {{channels}} open in response to specific ligand molecules binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor protein.

Examples of such channels include the cation-permeable [...] "nicotinic" [...] Acetylcholine receptor, ionotropic glutamate-gated receptors, acid sensing ion channels (ASICs), ATP-gated P2X receptors, and the anion-permeable γ-aminobutyric acid-gated GABAA receptor.|$|E

2500|$|It {{may seem}} {{counterintuitive}} that a channel should allow potassium ions {{but not the}} smaller sodium ions through. However in an aqueous environment, potassium and sodium cations are solvated by water molecules. When moving through the selectivity filter of the potassium channel, the water-K+ interactions are replaced by interactions between K+ and carbonyl groups of the <b>channel</b> <b>protein.</b> The diameter of the selectivity filter is ideal for the potassium cation, but {{too big for the}} smaller sodium cation. Hence the potassium cations are well [...] "solvated" [...] by the protein carbonyl groups, but these same carbonyl groups are too far apart to adequately solvate the sodium cation. Hence, the passage of potassium cations through this selectivity filter is strongly favored over sodium cations.|$|E

2500|$|The large {{majority}} of studies into the structural basis for KCNE1 modulation of Kv channels focus on its interaction with KCNQ1 (previously named KvLQT1). [...] Residues in the transmembrane domain of KCNE1 lies close to the selectivity filter of KCNQ1 within heteromeric KCNQ1-KCNE1 channel complexes., [...] The C-terminal domain of KCNE1, specifically from amino acids 73 to 79 is necessary for stimulation of slow delayed potassium rectifier current by SGK1. The interaction of KCNE1 with an alpha helix in the S6 KvLQT1 domain contributes to the higher affinity this channel has for benzodiazepine L7 and chromanol 293B by repositioning amino acid residues to allow for this. [...] KCNE1 destabilizes the S4-S5 alpha-helix linkage in the KCNQ1 <b>channel</b> <b>protein</b> in addition to destabilizing the S6 alpha helix, leading to slower activation of this channel when associated with KCNE1.
