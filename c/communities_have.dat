5|$|<b>Communities</b> <b>have</b> {{formed around}} the creation, play and {{discussion}} of LARP. These <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> developed a subculture that crosses over with role-playing, fan, reenactment, and drama subcultures. Early LARP subculture focused on Tolkien-like fantasy, but it later broadened to include appreciation of other genres, especially the horror genre with the rapid uptake of the World of Darkness setting in the 1990s. Like many subcultures, LARP groups often have a common context of shared experience, language, humour, and clothing that can be regarded {{by some as a}} lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|After the {{destruction}} of the Second Temple and the exile of the majority of Jews from the land of Israel, Jewish cuisine continued to develop in the many countries where Jewish <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> existed since Late Antiquity, influenced by the economics, agriculture, and culinary traditions of those countries.|$|E
5|$|Plant <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> been {{classified}} into nine categories: lowland subtropical rainforest, submontane rainforest, cloud-forest and scrub, lowland swamp forest, mangrove scrub and seagrass, coastal scrub and cliff vegetation, inland scrub and herbland, offshore island vegetation, shoreline and beach vegetation, and disturbed vegetation.|$|E

5|$|The dune, {{limestone}} {{and salt}} lake vegetation communities on North Island {{are considered to}} have high conservation significance. The dune and limestone <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> high biodiversity, are highly sensitive to disturbance and regenerate slowly. The salt lake community is considered significant because of the rarity of salt lakes on offshore islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Darby Creek {{and several}} other nearby creeks house most of the herptiles in Delaware County. The macroinvertebrate communities of the creek mainly consist of Limestone Agricultural Stream communities. No mussel <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> been described on the creek. In the 2000s, the dry weight of periphyton in the creek was 248.2 grams per square meter.|$|E
5|$|Among some Betsimisaraka it is {{considered}} fady for a brother {{to shake hands with}} his sister, or for young men to wear shoes during their father's lifetime. Among many Betsimisaraka, the eel {{is considered}} sacred. It is forbidden to touch, fish or eat eel. Although many coastal Malagasy <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> a fady against the consumption of pork, this is not universal or common among the Betsimisaraka, who often keep pigs in their villages.|$|E

5|$|Developer <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> {{used the}} SDK to port later {{versions}} of Windows Mobile OS to older devices {{and making the}} OS images available for free, thus providing the devices with the current feature set. Microsoft has tolerated this procedure for some time but decided in February 2007 to ask developers to take their OS images off the net, which in turn raised discussions. At the same time Microsoft offered upgrades to Windows Mobile 6 versions to manufacturers for free.|$|E
5|$|In North America and elsewhere, some Heathen <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> formalized such values into {{an ethical}} code, the Nine Noble Virtues (NNV), {{which is based}} largely on the Hávamál from the Poetic Edda. There are {{different}} forms of the NNV, with the number nine having symbolic associations in Norse mythology. Opinion is divided on the NNV; some practitioners deem them too dogmatic, while others eschew them for not having authentic roots in historical Germanic culture, negatively viewing them {{as an attempt to}} imitate the Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments. The NNV are not universal among Heathens, and it has for instance been noted that they are rare among Swedish practitioners.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> {{their own}} {{particular}} style of cuisines, {{such as the}} Jains, Kayasths and Muslims. There are also certain sub-regional delicacies. Awadhi cuisine is world-famous for dishes such as kebab, biryani, keema and nihari. Sweets occupy an important place in the Hindu diet and are eaten at social ceremonies. People make distinctive sweetmeats from milk products, including khurchan, peda, gulabjamun, petha, makkhan malai, and chamcham. The chaat in Lucknow and Banarasi Paan is known across India for its flavour and ingredients.|$|E
25|$|The Sephardic Jewish <b>community</b> <b>had</b> been in Hebron {{continuously}} {{for approximately}} 800 {{years and the}} Ashkenazi <b>community</b> <b>had</b> roots there that went back for about one century. Jews living there claim that they are resettling areas where Jews have lived since time immemorial.|$|R
5000|$|In the Piercy Report of 1944, the {{settlement}} was called Garson Lake or Whitefish Lake. The <b>community</b> <b>had</b> seventeen families with 50 {{children under the}} age of 18. The <b>community</b> <b>had</b> no services of any kind and was not accessible by road.|$|R

5|$|Several ethnic {{minority}} <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> centred on Whitechapel Road. The road was {{a focal point}} of the Jewish Community from the 1850s to the 1930s, with many Jewish shops and market stalls. Towards {{the latter part of the}} 20th century, the street became an established settlement of the British Bangladeshi community, who now sell a range of authentic Asian food and clothes in the market and on shop fronts. Altab Ali Park sits on the site of the original church at the western end of Whitechapel Road, and is a memorial to an Asian worker who suffered a fatal racial attack in 1978.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese Indonesian {{population}} of Sumatra accounts {{for nearly half}} of the group's national population. Although they are generally more urbanized than Indonesia's indigenous population, significant rural and agricultural communities exist throughout the country. Declining fertility rates have resulted in an upward shift in the population pyramid, as the median age increases. Emigration has contributed to a shrinking population, and <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> emerged in more industrialized nations {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Some have participated in repatriation programs to the People's Republic of China, while others emigrated to Western countries to escape anti-Chinese sentiment. Among the overseas residents, their identities are noticeably more Indonesian than Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Whitebark pine <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> {{been heavily}} damaged {{due to the}} effects of blister rust, a non native fungus. In Glacier and the {{surrounding}} region, 30% of the whitebark pine trees have died and over 70% of the remaining trees are currently infected. The whitebark pine provides a high fat pine cone seed, commonly known as the pine nut, that is a favorite food of red squirrels and Clark's nutcracker. Both grizzlies and black bears are known to raid squirrel caches of pine nuts, one of the bears' favorite foods. Between 1930 and 1970, efforts to control the spread of blister rust were unsuccessful, and continued destruction of whitebark pines appears likely, with attendant negative impacts on dependent species.|$|E

50|$|By 1885, Golden had a post office, and the <b>community</b> <b>had</b> a {{population}} of 100 by 1890. A bank opened in the city in 1907. The <b>community</b> <b>had</b> {{a population}} zenith of 650 in 1914 and boasted a telephone connection, and the Golden Rule, a community newspaper.|$|R
5|$|Direct trade {{links between}} the Mediterranean lands and India had been {{established}} in the late 2nd century BC by the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. Greek navigators learned to use the regular pattern of the monsoon winds for their trade voyages in the Indian Ocean. The lively sea trade in Roman times is confirmed by the excavation of large deposits of Roman coins along much of the coast of India. Many trading ports with links to Roman <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> been identified in India and Sri Lanka along the route used by the Roman mission. Archaeological evidence stretching from the Red Sea ports of Roman Egypt to India suggests that Roman commercial activity in the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia declined heavily with the Antonine Plague of 166 AD, {{the same year as}} the first Roman embassy to Han China, where similar plague outbreaks had occurred from 151 AD.|$|E
5|$|On the microeconomic scale, {{companies}} have used telecommunications {{to help build}} global business empires. This is self-evident {{in the case of}} online retailer Amazon.com but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer Walmart has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors. In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In Bangladesh's Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In Côte d'Ivoire, coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price.|$|E
5|$|Since Sri Lanka gained {{independence}} from Britain in 1948, {{relations between the}} majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil <b>communities</b> <b>have</b> been strained. Rising ethnic and political tensions, along with ethnic riots in 1956, 1958, 1977, 1981 and 1983, {{led to the formation}} and strengthening of militant groups advocating independence for Tamils. The ensuing civil war resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000people and the forced disappearance of thousands of others. The civil war ended in 2009 but there are continuing allegations of atrocities being committed by the Sri Lankan Military and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam during its final months. A United Nations panel found that as many as 40,000 civilians may {{have been killed in the}} final months of the civil war. The end of the civil war has not improved conditions in Sri Lanka, with press freedom not being restored and judiciary coming under political control.|$|E
