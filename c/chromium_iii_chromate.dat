Reduction of the chromium (VI) to <b>chromium</b> (<b>III)</b> by hydrazinium sulfate was investigated. The influence of hydronium ion concentration, contact time, hydrazinium sulphate dosage and temperature has been tested in batch runs. The process was found to be acid, temperature and concentration dependent. The suitability of weathered basalt andesite products as a potential sorbent was assessed for the removal of <b>chromium</b> (<b>III)</b> following batch mode of operation. The effect of various parameters such as hydronium ion concentration, shaking time, sorbent dose, initial metal ion concentration and temperature on the removal of <b>chromium</b> (<b>III)</b> from aqueous solution was studied. Thermodynamic parameters (∆H°, ∆S ° and ∆G°) for the sorption process were evaluated. Analysis of sorption obtained results showed that the sorption pattern followed the Freundlich, Langmuir and Dubinin-Kaganer-Radushkevich isotherms. The process follows pseudo second order rate and surface diffusion is identified as the predominating mechanism. The sorption process was shown to be reversible by the recovery of sorbed <b>chromium</b> (<b>III)</b> upon extraction with 0. 5 M nitric acid. The sorbent, before and after sorption, was characterized by fourier transform infrared spectrometer, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmision electron microscope and thermo-gravimetric analyse methodes.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a chromating process, in which different anodes are used for deposition and oxidation of <b>Chromium</b> (<b>III)</b> ions to <b>Chromium</b> (IV) ions, in which the oxidation anode as above is used. USE - Used for regenerating solutions containing chromic acid by anodic oxidation of <b>Chromium</b> (<b>III)</b> to <b>Chromium</b> (IV) in electrolytic chromating baths, which are used for electroplating, chromation, etching e. g. acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) plastics and anodizing e. g. aluminum.

In anodic operation, it becomes coated with lead dioxide. However, lead anodes form sludge and have limited dimensional stability.
