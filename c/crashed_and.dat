5|$|In 1915 a Farman {{aeroplane}} crash-landed at Southcote Farm next to Southcote Junction. The {{pilot was}} able to jump from the plane before it <b>crashed,</b> <b>and</b> ran alongside it until it collided with a hedge near the railway embankment.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the French {{government}} made an official investigation, concluding {{that it was}} possible that the aircraft had reached Newfoundland. In 1989, the NBC television series Unsolved Mysteries advanced the theory that the two aviators made it across the ocean, but <b>crashed</b> <b>and</b> perished in the woods of Maine. One of Nungesser's relatives, William Nungesser, made several trips to Maine to search, focusing his energies around the north slope of Round Lake Hills in Washington County, Maine, as well as the area around Lake Winnipesaukee.|$|E
5|$|Loring {{also had}} its share of {{incidents}} that did not result in fatalities over the years. On 6 March 1955, a B-36 Peacemaker <b>crashed</b> <b>and</b> burned in a snowbank at Loring. All crewmembers were able to escape unharmed. On 26 June 1958, a B-52D (55‑0102) burned on the ground at Loring and was destroyed. On 25 May 1969, a KC-135A (56–3602) broke in two after aborting takeoff. The cause was a frozen water injection surge tube. On 19 July 1970, a B-52G (58‑0208) also caught on fire and was destroyed on the ground.|$|E

5|$|As {{the riders}} entered the flat lands near the Belgian coast, the winds became more problematic. Around {{three-quarters of the}} peloton had been dropped or had {{withdrawn}} from the race {{by the time the}} riders turned back inland. Gert Steegmans (Trek Factory Racing) was blown sideways into a ditch; the wind knocked several other riders over and caused Martin Velits (Etixx-Quick Step) and Lars Bak (Lotto-Soudal) to withdraw from the race. Mark Cavendish <b>crashed</b> <b>and</b> was forced to chase to attempt to rejoin the leading riders. The conditions were so severe that some team officials called for the race to be neutralised to ensure the riders' safety. Shortly afterwards, two large groups came back together. The main peloton was therefore made up of around 100 riders and was approximately two minutes behind the breakaway. The breakaway was caught soon afterwards.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{sought to}} investigate the relationship between capacity and safety on freeway roadways in New Jersey. Using the State's roadway database, capacity was estimated for State roadways using the procedures in the Highway Capacity Manual. Crash prediction models were developed relating <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> rates to the geometric variables used to estimate capacity {{as well as to}} capacity and v/c ratio. The research showed that as capacity increases the number of <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> rate also increases. As v/c ratio increased the number of <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> rate decreased indicating that congestion may result in reduced speeds and as a result a lower number of <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crash</b> rates. The research points to the need to include operational parameters in performing road safety evaluations...|$|R

40|$|The {{magnitude}} of leftward bias demonstrated in pseudoneglect {{has been found}} to differ between younger and older adults in laboratory settings. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the association between age and asymmetries in navigation in a naturalistic setting by examining the frequency of the location of impact on participants' vehicles during <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> near <b>crashes.</b> The location of impact following <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> near <b>crashes,</b> <b>and</b> participant's age and gender were retrieved from the SHRP 2 NDS database, a large scale naturalistic driving study. Over the course of the study, data were collected from 3, 546 participants driving in the United States of America (right-side traffic directionality), which included 1, 465 <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> 2, 722 near <b>crashes.</b> During <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> near <b>crashes,</b> irrespective of age, the location impact was most often on the front side of the participant vehicle. In contrast with results from laboratory environments, age was not associated with the location of impact during <b>crashes</b> <b>and</b> near <b>crashes,</b> <b>and</b> overall, <b>crashes</b> were over-represented on the left side of the vehicle compared to the right. Specifically, crashes were 1. 41 times as likely to occur on the left compared to the right side of participants' vehicles. Overall, these findings inform future research that attempts to apply laboratory research, regarding asymmetry in navigation, to naturalistic settings...|$|R
5|$|Further medal {{success was}} {{anticipated}} at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, which were attended by 24 Australian athletes. Zali Steggall, who months earlier {{had become the}} first Australian woman to win a World Cup event and was ranked sixth in the world, won the country's first individual medal with a bronze in slalom skiing. Her time of 1m 32.67s was only 0.27s behind the gold medallist.

5|$|The Egyptian army {{unleashed}} {{its full}} anti-aircraft arsenal and hit Alon's plane, {{but he managed}} to crash-land unharmed at 20:05, performing a ground loop. Weizmann landed at 20:15. Eddie Cohen, a volunteer pilot from South Africa, <b>crashed</b> <b>and</b> died, although it is unknown whether he was hit by anti-aircraft fire, or a technical problem caused the plane to malfunction. A report by Dan Tolkovsky, the Israeli Air Force operations officer at the time, stated that Cohen likely attempted to land at the Hatzor Airbase instead of Ekron, where eyewitnesses saw a burning plane crashing in the distance. He was the first Israeli Air Force KIA, and was buried in Tel Aviv (Nahalat Yitzhak) after his remains were found at the end of 1949.|$|E
5|$|The race's {{penultimate}} day {{of racing}} {{was scheduled to}} go from Bari to Naples. During the stage, Lucien Petit-Breton <b>crashed</b> <b>and</b> was forced to abandon the race. The route had the riders go through rough roads that were heavy with dust and occasional passed over streams, thus flooding the roads. The riders were also chase by enraged buffalo. All of those factors caused the riders to end the stage a few kilometers short of Naples, in Pompeii with Alfredo Sivocci winning the day. The last stage ended back in Rome, where the race began. Ezio Corlaita took his second stage win as 24 riders that began the Giro finished the day. Bianchi's Carlo Galetti became the first rider to win two editions of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1944, the {{squadron}} had expanded its operations to New Guinea, making courier flights to Merauke initially, and later Wewak, Noemfoor and Hollandia. It transferred to Essendon, Victoria, on 1September. The unit was {{now one of}} eight Australian transport squadrons, all of which operated {{under the control of}} RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. Their primary duty was supporting the Australian military, though they could also be released for urgent requests by General Douglas MacArthur's South West Pacific Area headquarters. A Lodestar <b>crashed</b> <b>and</b> burned on takeoff at Merauke on 26January 1945 but all aboard escaped injury; it was the only hull loss suffered by the type in Australian service. No.37 Squadron received its first three Douglas C-47Dakotas the following month, {{and by the end of}} March had a complement of eighteen aircraft: nine Dakotas, seven Lodestars, a Douglas DC-2, and a deHavilland Tiger Moth. The next month it began operating detachments out of Parafield, South Australia, and Morotai in the Dutch East Indies.

5|$|Just {{before the}} line opened on 22 July 1847, the Wear Valley Railway absorbed the Shildon Tunnel, Bishop Auckland & Weardale Railway, Weardale Extension Railway and Wear & Derwent Railway {{and then the}} S leased the Wear Valley Railway and Middlesbrough & Redcar Railways for 999 years. This {{required}} a payment of £47,000 each year, exceeding the SD's net revenue; traffic from the Derwent Iron Company was reduced {{during a period of}} financial difficulty and the Black Boy colliery switched to sending its coal to Hartlepool. No dividend was paid in 1848 and the next few years; lease payments were made out of reserves. The S announced a bill in November 1848 to permit a lease by and amalgamation with the YN, but this was withdrawn after the YN share price <b>crashed</b> <b>and</b> its chairman Hudson resigned after questions were raised about his share dealings.

5|$|OTUs, {{employing}} as {{they did}} warplanes that were more advanced and more powerful than trainers, and teaching combat techniques that often carried high risk, generally suffered higher accident rates than other flying training schools. On 3March 1943, a Wirraway of No.4 OTU crashed near Williamtown, killing both crewmen. Two others died when their Vengeance <b>crashed</b> <b>and</b> burned near Goulburn during a cross-country exercise on 4August. On 16August, a Vengeance flew into trees after apparently pulling out late from a dive, resulting in two fatalities. A Vengeance blew up in flight during dive-bombing practice at Williamtown on 14September, killing both crewmen. On 5October, a Vengeance on a dive-bombing exercise crashed into the sea near Newcastle; both crewmen were reported as missing, believed killed. No.4 OTU suffered two more fatalities when a Vengeance struck a hill near Braidwood during a cross-country flight on 26November 1943. Another Vengeance hit the water and exploded in Nelson Bay on 7April 1944 after failing to recover from a dive, killing the two-man crew.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of his military career in the United States, and while he did not keep an ongoing record, he estimated that he had flown 89 combat missions. This number was disputed by the records of the Army Air Corps {{and other members of the}} 394th Bomber Squadron. For example, one pilot in the same bomb group as Roddenberry flew eighty missions, but took three times longer than Roddenberry had claimed to do so. In October, he was assigned to Fort Worth, Texas and then the 18th Replacement Wing at Salt Lake City. He was subsequently moved to the Office of Flight Safety based in Oakland, California. In February 1944, he moved back to March Field and was promoted to Captain and subsequently flew all over the United States in his role as a plane crash investigator. During this time he was in another accident as a passenger on a military flight that <b>crashed</b> <b>and</b> caught fire. Roddenberry pulled three men to safety.

On 9 April, Pattle claimed a Junkers Ju 88 (actually a Do 17) damaged. He left the burning machine as it disappeared into cloud. Pattle received confirmation that the aircraft <b>crashed</b> <b>and</b> he drove out with a member of the squadron to bring back souvenirs. On 10 April, he flew as fighter escort for No. 11 Squadron Blenheims on a mission over Betjol, Yugoslavia. They were attacked by flights of Messerschmitt Bf 110s and Bf 109s. Pattle shot down a Bf 110 which was seen to crash in flames and a Bf 109 whose pilot bailed out. On Good Friday, Pattle led his squadron into battle against German bombers minelaying over Volos harbour. He dispatched a Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 into the sea.
