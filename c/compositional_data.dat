40|$|<b>Compositional</b> count <b>data</b> are {{discrete}} vectors {{representing the}} numbers of outcomes falling into any of several mutually exclusive categories. Compositional techniques based on the log-ratio methodology are appropriate in those cases where the total sum of the vector elements is not of interest. Such <b>compositional</b> count <b>data</b> sets can contain zero values which are often the result of insufficiently large samples. That is, they refer to unobserved positive values {{that may have been}} observed with a larger number of trials or with a different sampling design. Because the log-ratio transformations require data with positive values, any statistical analysis of count compositions must be preceded by a proper replacement of the zeros. A Bayesian-multiplicative treatment has been proposed for addressing this count zero problem in several case studies. This treatment involves the Dirichlet prior distribution as the conjugate distribution of the multinomial distribution and a multiplicative modification of the non-zero values. Different parameterizations of the prior distribution provide different zero replacement results, whose coherence with the vector space structure of the simplex is stated.

Besides silica, soda and lime which are the major components, magnesia, potash and phosphorus are typically minor impurities associated with a plant ash soda flux, while iron, titania and alumina may enter the glass as natural sedimentary contamination of the silica sand source [8, 11, 16, 25, 36, 37, 61 : p. 162 T].

The present article extends Thurstonian modeling of binary choice data (Brown & Maydeu-Olivares, 2011 a) to “proportion-of-total” (compositional) formats. Following Aitchison (1982), <b>compositional</b> item <b>data</b> are transformed into log-ratios, conceptualized as differences of latent item utilities. The mean and covariance structure of the log-ratios is modelled using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), where the item utilities are first-order factors, and personal attributes measured by a questionnaire are second-order factors. A simulation study with two sample sizes, N= 300 and N= 1000, shows that the method provides very good recovery of true parameters and near-nominal rejection rates. The approach is illustrated with empirical data from N= 317 students, comparing model parameters obtained with compositional and Likert scale versions of a Big Five measure.
