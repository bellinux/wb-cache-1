40|$|Polymeric self-resettable circuit {{protection}} devices have been manufactured {{for many years}} with an extrusion based process. These devices add negligible resistance to a circuit at normal power operating conditions but increases in resistance by several orders of magnitude at a pre-determined level of power {{in order to protect}} the circuit from over- current or over-voltage conditions. After the electrical surge stops, and power returns to a normal level, the resistance of the device drops, and the circuit may resume its normal operation. These devices are used in computers, cell-phones, and other consumer and industrial electronic devices where normal fuses are not convenient or practical. The current manufacturing process extrudes long sheets of 2 -mm thick polymer lined with 0. 05 -mm thick foil on both sides. This foil-polymer-foil structure, called plaque, is punched into 13 mm x 8 mm x 2 mm rectangles, called chips. The chips undergo heat treatment and radioactive cross-linking steps before wire leads are soldered onto them for easy electrical connection to either test or circuit boards. Though effective, this process produces more waste and remains less flexible than an injection-compression (IC) molding process. With this new process, devices are made individually in a multi- <b>cavity</b> <b>mold,</b> skipping the punching and soldering steps. This thesis explores IC molding and its benefits and drawbacks for manufacturing {{circuit protection}} devices. IC molded devices were manufactured, tested, and compared to standard devices, produced by the extrusion process, in the areas of physical and electrical performance. (cont.) Budget considerations prevented the study of individually IC molded devices and instead a 150 mm x 75 mm mold cavity was used to create an IC molded plaque from which chips could be punched and wire leads attached. In this way, any electrical variations across the IC molded plaque, produced by flow or thermal properties of the new process, could be studied with electrical tests, and physical variations across the IC molded plaque could be examined with a peel test. Cycle life data and data comparing device resistance to device temperature show that the new manufacturing process has potential to create equal or better performing devices than the existing extrusion process. by Joseph T.

40|$|This project {{addresses}} {{improvements in}} metal casting processes by reducing scrap {{and reducing the}} cost of production, due to scrap reduction from investment casting and yield improvement offered by lost foam casting as compared to no-bake or green sand molding. The objectives for the investment casting portion of the subtask are to improve knowledge of fracture toughness of mold shells and the sources of strength limiting flaws and to understand the effects of wax reclamation procedures on wax properties. Applying 'clean steel' approaches to pouring technology and cleanliness in investment casting of steel are anticipated to improve incoming materials inspection procedures as they affect the microstructure and toughness of the shell. This project focused on two areas of study {{in the production of}} steel castings to reduce scrap and save energy: (1) Reducing the amount of shell cracking in investment cast steel production; (2) Investigate the potential of lost foam steel casting The basic findings regarding investment casting shell cracking were: (1) In the case of post pouring cracking, this could be related to phase changes in silica upon cooling and could be delayed by pouring arrangement strategies that maintained the shell surface at temperature for longer time. Employing this delay resulted in less adherent oxidation of castings since the casting was cooler at the time o fair exposure. (2) A model for heat transfer through water saturated shell materials under steam pressure was developed. (3) Initial modeling result of autoclave de-waxing indicated the higher pressure and temperature in the autoclave would impose a steeper temperature gradient on the wax pattern, causing some melt flow prior to bulk expansion and decreasing the stress on the green shell. Basic findings regarding lost foam casting of steel at atmospheric pressure: (1) EPS foam generally decomposes by the collapse mode in steel casting. (2) There is an accumulation of carbon pick-up {{at the end of the}} casting opposite the gate. (3) It is recommended that lost foam castings in steel be gated for a quiescent fill in an empty <b>cavity</b> <b>mold</b> to prevent foam occlusion defects from the collapse mode. The energy benefit is primarily in yield savings and lower casting weight per function due to elimination of draft and parting lines for the larger lost foam castings. For the smaller investment casting, scrap losses due to shell cracking will be reduced. Both of these effects will reduce the metal melted per good ton of castings. There will also be less machine stock required per casting which is a yield savings and a small additional energy savings in machining. Downstream savings will come from heavy truck and railroad applications. Application of these processes to heavy truck castings will lighten the heavy truck fleet by about ten pounds per truck. Using ten years to achieve full penetration of the truck fleet at linear rate this will result in a fuel savings of 131 trillion BTU over ten years...|$|E

40|$|In {{metal casting}} processes, surface {{tension of the}} molten metal {{typically}} resists filling of the metal into the mold. The effects are greater for smaller <b>mold</b> <b>cavities,</b> and ultimately, the smallest cavities may not be filled. Surface tension forces can be overcome by applying pressure (head) to the molten metal, thus forcing metal into the cavities.

Filling-pressure windows are investigated for cylindrical-shaped <b>mold</b> <b>cavities</b> on both a theoretical and experimental basis.
