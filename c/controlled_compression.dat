50|$|The Helical Camshaft {{would allow}} both the Atkinson Cycle and LIVC {{to be applied}} simultaneously. The high CR would allow even greater amount of LIVC to be used at idle thus further {{reducing}} pumping losses and improving efficiency. The resulting engine would have a fuel economy very similar to (or better than) a diesel - and it could run on the cheaper LPG fuel. It would also be lighter in weight and cheaper to make than a diesel. A car fitted with such an engine {{would appear to be}} a much simpler and cheaper alternative to a “hybrid” car. (But a hybrid fitted with a Helical Camshaft/Atkinson/LIVC engine would be more economical still). One of the more recent “fashionable” areas of engine research at present is the Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (or HCCI) engine. It amounts to running a spark ignition engine at light or part load in a similar fashion to a diesel engine. HCCI requires the compression pressure to be very quickly and accurately altered so that the more-or-less <b>controlled</b> <b>compression</b> ignition doesn’t suddenly blossom into full-blown detonation. One of the main strengths of the Helical Camshaft is that it can do exactly that. However, {{it would seem that the}} easily controlled LIVC (with or without Atkinson high CR effects) is a much simpler way to control an engine than the decidedly risky HCCI process - and it is doubtful that HCCI is more fuel-efficient than LIVC, etc.|$|E

We {{report on}} {{computer}} <b>controlled</b> <b>compression</b> of femtosecond laser pulses using a programmable liquid crys-tal {{spatial light modulator}} which is feedback-controlled by an evolutionary algorithm. This algorithm generates the opti-mal laser field {{on the basis of}} feedback from the experiment by optimizing the laser pulse iteratively. Without knowledge of the (chirped) input pulses, the experimental signal (second harmonic light=SHG) is maximized by the algorithm, thus re-sulting in fully compressed pulses. This method only makes use of the experiment’s response (SHG signal) on the formed pulses. No other parameters need to be considered. This ap-proach leads to many experimental applications in all fields of optics and ultrafast spectroscopy where particularly shaped pulses are advantageous. PACS: 42. 65. Re; 02. 10. Jf; 07. 05.

40|$|Abstract. Thermomechanical {{behavior}} of Al-Mg-Si alloys {{has been studied}} to investigate the effect of microstructural features such as pre-existing substructure and distribution of particles on the deformation characteristics. The <b>controlled</b> <b>compression</b> tests {{have been carried out}} to get the basic information on how the alloy responds to temperature, strain amount and strain rate. Microstructural features after forging have been discussed in terms of the thermomechanical response of Al-Mg-Si alloys. As already well mentioned, we have found that the high temperature deformation of Al-Mg-Si brought the recovered structure. However, the abnormally large grains seems to occur in a certain condition as a result of deformation assisted grain growth, which means that hot forging of Al-Mg-Si alloys could lead to the undesirable microstructures and the consequent mechanical properties such as fatigue strength...|$|E
40|$|Reactivity <b>controlled</b> <b>compression</b> {{ignition}} through in-cylinder blending {{gasoline and}} diesel {{to a desired}} reactivity has previously been shown to give low emission levels and a clear simultaneous efficiency advantage. To determine the possible viability of the concept for on-road application, the control space of injection parameters with respect to combustion phasing is presented. Four injection strategies have been investigated, and for each the respective combustion phasing response is presented. Combustion efficiency is shown to be greatly affected by both the injection-timing and injection-strategy. All injection strategies are shown to break with the common soot-NOx trade-off, with both smoke and NOx emissions being near or even below upcoming legislated levels. Lastly, pressure rise rates are comparable with conventional combustion regimes with the same phasing. The pressure rise rates are effectively suppressed by the high dilution rates used...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} in {{peripheral nervous system}} returns to the cell body of neurons in central nervous system in a retrograde manner which leads to brain and spinal degeneration. It is probable that Achillea biebersteinii might prevent the injury progress. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of alcholic extract of Achillea biebersteinii leaves on spinal α motoneurons degenarion after sciatic nerve compression in rats. Methods: 30 male wistar rats were divided randomly into groups of <b>control,</b> <b>compression,</b> compression with treatment of 50, 75, 100 mg/kg doses. Sciatic nerve was exposed to compression for 60 s using locker pincers. Extract injection was done intraperitoneally {{in the first and}} second weeks after compression. Then 28 days after compression under perfusion method, the lumber spinal cord was sampled. After cutting and coloring, the density of motoneurons was measured using dissector methods. Results: The study results demonstrated a meaningful difference between <b>compression</b> and <b>control</b> groups in regard with neuronal density (P= 0. 000). Neuronal density showed also a significant meaningful increase (P< 0. 01) in alcoholic extract treatment groups of 50, 75, 100 mg/kg compared to the compression group. Conclusion: The study findings revealed that Alcohlic extracts of Achillea biebersteinii leaves, containing growth and regeneration factors, has neuroprotective effect on spinal cord alpha motoneurons after injury. The extract with 75 mg/kg dose was reported as the most effective one. ...|$|R

In turn, for JPEG 2000 [38] and SPIHT [35], the required CR can be approximately provided by setting the corresponding desired bpp. In some applications this is an obvious advantage of the modern wavelet-based coders although, as it will be shown below, {{this is not the case}} for the considered application. Note that for JPEG 2000 it is also possible to vary QS but not bpp although this is not the basic option [38].|$|R
