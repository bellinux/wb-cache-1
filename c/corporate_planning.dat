40|$|The {{financial}} {{advisory firm}} Greenhill Caliburn identified three key {{areas of risk}} with NBN Co's <b>corporate</b> <b>plan</b> including rollout cost, take up rates and average revenue. Our interpolation between recent trends and indications in these three areas and projections in NBN Co’s <b>corporate</b> <b>plan</b> suggests a significant gap between NBN Co’s likely targets and projections in its <b>corporate</b> <b>plan.</b> Any short fall between actual results and planning targets should be apparent by the 2013 financial year. With an election due soon after that, this would {{provide an opportunity to}} revise the <b>corporate</b> <b>plan,</b> most likely by retaining copper based access for longer. Policy issues need to be considered in the context that copper will remain a component of high-speed broadband networks for much longer than envisaged in the current NBN <b>corporate</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|R

500|$|In 2000, Iwata took a {{position}} at Nintendo {{as the head of}} its <b>corporate</b> <b>planning</b> division and took a seat on the board of directors. Over the next two years, he sought to reduce the cost and length of game development while preserving quality. During his first two years at Nintendo, the company saw profit increases of 20 and 41percent, values which are at least partially attributable to his work. When Yamauchi, the company's president since 1949, retired on May24, 2002, Iwata succeeded as Nintendo's fourth president with Yamauchi's blessing. He was the first Nintendo president unrelated to the Yamauchi family through blood or marriage since its founding in 1889. Yamauchi left the company in Iwata's hands with a final request: [...] "that Nintendo give birth to wholly new ideas and create hardware which reflects that ideal. And make software that adheres to that same standard." [...] Iwata inherited a company that promoted individualism, with a policy established by Yamauchi to create new development positions as needed. However, this inhibited efficient collaboration between certain departments.|$|E
