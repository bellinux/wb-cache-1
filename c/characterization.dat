Furthermore, we show a duality theorem for quasiconvex programming by using set containment <b>characterizations.</b> Notions of quasiconjugate for quasiconvex functions, especially 1, - 1 -quasiconjugate, 1 -semiconjugate, H-quasiconjugate and R-quasiconjugate, play important roles to derive <b>characterizations</b> {{of the set}} containments...|$|R

An investigator will be vitally interested to know if their model fits the requirements of a particular distribution.

Various <b>characterizations</b> of distributions have been established in many different directions. In this section, two main <b>characterizations</b> of the OGE family are presented. These <b>characterizations</b> are based on: (i) a simple relationship between two truncated moments; (ii) a single function of the random variable.|$|R
40|$|This paper studies new Lancaster <b>characterizations</b> of bivariate multivariate Poisson, {{negative}} binomial {{and normal}} distributions which have diagonal expansions in multivariate orthogonal polynomials.

Multivariate Poisson-Charlier, Meixner and Hermite-Chebycheff orthogonal polynomials, {{used in the}} <b>characterizations,</b> are constructed from classical 1 -dimensional orthogonal polynomials and multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials. New classes of transition functions of discrete and continuous time Markov chains with these polynomials as eigenfunctions are characterized.

5|$|The <b>characterization</b> of Neville Sinclair was {{inspired}} by movie star Errol Flynn, or rather by the image of Flynn that had been popularized by Charles Higham's unauthorized and fabricated biography of the actor, in which he asserted that Flynn was, among other things, a Nazi spy. The film's Neville Sinclair is, like Higham's Flynn, a movie star known {{for his work in}} swashbuckler roles, and who is secretly a Nazi spy. Because Higham's biography of Flynn was not refuted until the late 1980s, the image of Flynn as a closet Nazi remained current all through the arduous process of writing and re-writing the script.

In this work, we study <b>characterizations</b> for multiobjective programming problem solutions when functions belonging to the problem are differentiable. These <b>characterizations</b> need some conditions of convexity. In differentiable scalar programming problems the concept of invexity is very important. We prove that it is also necessary for the multiobjective programming problem and give some <b>characterizations</b> of multiobjective programming problem solutions under weaker conditions. We define analogous concepts to those of stationary points and to the conditions of Kuhn–Tucker and Fritz–John for the multiobjective programming problem...|$|R
