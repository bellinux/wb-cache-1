40|$|The matured laser-diagnostic {{techniques}} of planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) {{were applied to}} a prototype gas turbine burner operating on various fuels. The work was performed to provide verification of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models of the combustion of atypical fuels in a gas turbine combustor. The burner was operated using methane and three synthesized fuels of interest- one with hydrogen as the principle component and two with a low heating value (15 MJ/m 3). Experiments were performed at pressures from 1 to 9 bar, with the fuel/air mixture at both ambient (~ 300 K) and elevated temperature. The burner, which was supplied by Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery, is a down-scaled prototype of that used in the SGT- 750 gas turbine. It is composed of three individual sectors that are arranged concentrically, a centermost pilot sector, intermediate sector and main sector. Each sector contributes a premixed fuel/air flow, while swirl elements in each sector promote flame stabilization and recirculation in the combustion region. There are dedicated fuel feeds allowing for localized setting of fuel/air mixture {{at each of the}} sectors. The <b>central</b> <b>pilot</b> sector of the burner was separable from the full burner assembly and was examined in detail. Information was generated regarding the use of syngas to fuel the burner. This information is intended to be used for the validation of CFD models of the experiments, including optimization of reduced chemical kinetic mechanisms for the specific fuels. Laminar flame speed measurements were made for several syngas fuel candidates from which the high-hydrogen syngas fuel was selected. Burner performance at the lean stability limit was examined using the fuels of interest. It was found that increasing the fuel/air ratio in the <b>central</b> <b>pilot</b> sector improved the lean limit onset of flame extinction up {{to the point that the}} <b>central</b> <b>pilot</b> extinguished. Optimization of the burner nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission by fuel partitioning among the three sectors was performed. The response in emission level with fuel/air ratio was not universal among the fuels tested. The largest portion of work in this thesis is the visualization of the burner combustion field by laser diagnostic methods. The flame shape was imaged by the PLIF of the OH radical distribution. PLIF imaging of the <b>central</b> <b>pilot</b> sector was recorded for atmospheric and elevated pressure for iterations of inlet air temperature, fuel type and equivalence ratio. When comparing the OH-LIF distribution for various fuels and pressures it was found that equivalence ratio had the greatest effect on the distribution of OH signal from the exit of the <b>central</b> <b>pilot</b> sector. Lean equivalence ratios showed a diffuse signal typical of the post combustion region. Near stoichiometric equivalence ratios yielded a distribution having a clearly defined inner edge indicating combustion occurring outside of the pilot sector. At rich equivalence ratios the OH signal was lifted away from the pilot burner exit. Comparison of OH-PLIF and chemiluminescence signal for methane combustion supported the characterization that the pilot sector efflux varied from post combustion to attached and then lifted flame in conjunction with the increase in equivalence ratio from lean to rich. OH-PLIF imaging was collected for staging of fuel to all three sectors of the burner at atmospheric pressure. The flow field in the combustion region produced by the full burner was visualized using PIV for each of fuels of interest, illustrating the recirculation zone. Finally the OH-LIF distribution was imaged for the combustion region of the entire burner at elevated pressure during operation at a single equivalence ratio with various dilutions of natural gas. There was little discernible change in flame shape as the pressure was changed from 3, 4. 5 and 6 bar and energy content was changed from 30, 40 and 45 MJ/m^ 3 Wobbe index...|$|E

40|$|Noise {{generated}} in gas turbine combustors can exist in several forms-broadband noise, sharp resonant peaks, and regular or intermittent nonlinear pulsing. In the present study, dynamic pressure measurements {{were made in}} several JP- 5 -fueled combustor configurations, at various mean pressures and temperatures. The fluctuating pressure was measured at mean pressures from 6 to 14 atm and inlet temperatures from 550 K to 850 K. The goal of the present work was to study the effect of changes in mean flow conditions on combustor noise: both broadband noise and sharp tones were considered. In general, {{the shape of the}} broadband noise spectrum was consistent from one configuration to another. The shape of the spectrum was influenced by the acoustic filtering of the combustion zone. This filtering ensured the basic consistency of the spectra. In general, the trends in broadband noise observed at low mean pressures were also seen at high mean pressures; that is, the total sound level decreased with both increasing equivalence ratio and increasing inlet temperature. The combustor configurations without a <b>central</b> <b>pilot</b> experienced higher broadband noise levels and were more susceptible to narrow peak resonances than configurations with a <b>central</b> <b>pilot.</b> The sharp peaks were more sensitive to the mean flow than was the broadband noise, and the effects were not always the same. In some situations, increasing the equivalence ratio made the sharp peaks grow, while at other conditions, increasing the equivalence ratio made the sharp peaks shrink. Thus, it was difficult to predict when resonances would occur; however, they were reproducible. Acoustic coupling between the upstream and downstream regions of the combustor {{may play a role in}} the sharp-peaked oscillations. Noise was also observed near lean blow out. As with other types of noise, lean blow out noise was affected by the combustion chamber acoustics, which apparently maintains the fluctuations at a uniform frequency. However, the actual conditions when this type of noise was experienced appeared to simply follow the lean blow out limit as it varied with mean temperature and pressure...|$|E

40|$|The {{near field}} {{combustion}} {{region of the}} multi-jet CGRI burner has been modelled as a two step methane/air reaction system; finite rate chemistry results correspond well with previously reported experimental data, while the eddy dissipation model produces qualitatively erroneous results. The burner nearfield consists of 14 jets (seven strong oxidant jets and 7 weaker fuel jets) which form a ring around a <b>central</b> <b>pilot.</b> This generates a unique flow field in which fuel jets are quickly entrained with furnace gases into a central core oriented along the burner axis. Such jet arrangement accomplishes high levels of flue gas re-circulation without the need to premix oxidant or fuel streams with the flue gases outside the combustion chamber. CFD modelling was performed using FLUENT with k-ε turbulence model and 2 -step chemistry for the methane/air reaction. The results agree well with the flow field and the species concentration data and reveal rather complicated flow pattern. The success in the near field modelling provides confidence in the current attempts to execute full furnace modelling with CGRI burners installed...|$|E
40|$|WOS: 000347870800085 International audienceThis study {{describes}} a new experiment {{to apply the}} pulverization technology for energy production from solid olive residue (olive cake). This is {{a contribution to the}} valorization of olive residue as a source of renewable energy available in the majority of mediterranean countries. A new burner made up of a coaxial cylindrical tube is especially designed and fabricated to produce an axisymetric turbulent reactive pulverized jet. A sample of olive cake comes from Tunisian origin is prepared for the experiment; this sample is crushed, dried and garbled in order to obtain small particles with a size below 200 mu m. In order to start the combustion of the pulverized olive cake jet and maintain the main flame, two types of pilot flame were used: a central premixed flame of methane/oxygen and an annular diffusion flame of methane. This paper shows the experimental parameters to obtain a feasible jet flame of olive cake in free air. The improvements to the burner in order to enhance the combustion have been presented. The effects of particle size and pilot flame position have been discussed. Results show that the olive cake jet flame is obtained only with particles at a size below 200 mu m. The combustion with an annular pilot flame ensures better burning conditions than a <b>central</b> <b>pilot</b> flame. The preheating system can improve the olive cake combustion...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} on the <b>central</b> <b>pilot</b> body (RPLrich- pilot-lean) of Siemens prototype 4 th generation DLE burner to investigate the flame behavior at atmospheric pressure condition when varying equivalence ratio, residence time and co-flow temperature. The flame at the RPL burner exit was investigated applying OH planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and high-speed chemiluminescence imaging. The results from chemiluminescence imaging and OH PLIF show that {{the size and shape}} of the flame are clearly affected by the variation in operating conditions. For both preheated and non-preheated co-flow cases, at lean equivalence ratios combustion starts early inside the burner and primary combustion comes to near completion inside the burner if residence time permits. For rich conditions, the unburnt fuel escapes out through the burner exit along with primary combustion products and combustion subsequently restarts downstream the burner at leaner condition and in a diffuse-like manner. For preheated co-flow, most of the operating conditions yield similar OH PLIF distributions and the flame is stabilizing at approximately the same spatial positions. It reveals the importance of the preheating co-flow for flame stabilization. Flame instabilities were observed and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is applied to time resolved chemiluminescence data to demonstrate how the flame is oscillating. Preheating has strong influence on the oscillation frequency. Additionally, combustion emissions were analyzed to observe the effect on NOX level for variation in operating conditions...|$|E
