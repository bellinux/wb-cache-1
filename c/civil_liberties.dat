5|$|The rise of totalitarian {{regimes in}} Germany, Russia, and other {{countries}} who rejected {{freedom of speech and}} association had a large impact on the <b>civil</b> <b>liberties</b> movement in the U.S.; anti-communist sentiment rose and <b>civil</b> <b>liberties</b> were curtailed.|$|E
40|$|The current {{literature}} {{has failed to}} differentiate between the collapse of democratic and authoritarian rules or whether democratic regimes collapse {{for the same reasons}} as do authoritarian regimes. Therefore, the {{current literature}} is silent on whether democracies are more fragile or less susceptible to economic and political breakdowns. Using a multitude of political instability variables, this paper explores empirically, whether political freedom and <b>civil</b> <b>liberty</b> (a proxy for democracy) has any effect on the stability of the political order. The empirical results of the paper confirm the hypothesis that democracy is conducive to political stability; the higher the level of political freedom and <b>civil</b> <b>liberty,</b> the more stable countries are. The paper also presented a Granger-causality test of political instability and the level of political freedom and <b>civil</b> <b>liberty.</b> The test results indicate that the level of political freedom and <b>civil</b> <b>liberty</b> Granger-cause the level of political instability, while the level of political instability does not Granger-cause the level of political freedom and <b>civil</b> <b>liberty.</b> The test results indicate that Granger-causality runs one-way from political freedom and <b>civil</b> <b>liberty</b> to political instability and not the other way. A further comprehensive research is needed on the multi-layered and the complex relationship among democracy and the resilience of the political order.

5|$|In March 2016, the New York <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> Union (NYCLU), the New York City {{office of}} the American <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> Union, {{wrote a letter to}} Mayor de Blasio {{outlining}} their privacy concerns. In the letter, representatives for the NYCLU wrote that CityBridge could be retaining too much information about LinkNYC users. They also stated that the privacy policy was vague and needed to be clarified. They recommended that the privacy policy be rewritten so that it expressly mentions whether the Links' environmental sensors or cameras are being used by any NYPD or city systems.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of the ACLU {{were divided}} on the best tactics to use to promote <b>civil</b> <b>liberties.</b> Felix Frankfurter felt that {{legislation}} was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme Court could not (andin his opinionshould not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But Walter Pollack, Morris Ernst, and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee <b>civil</b> <b>liberties.</b> A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, {{and there was a}} growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.|$|E

5|$|A major {{aspect of}} <b>civil</b> <b>liberties</b> {{progress}} after World War II was the undoing centuries {{of racism in}} federal, state, and local governments an effort generally associated with the Civil Rights Movement. Several <b>civil</b> <b>liberties</b> organizations worked together for progress, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the ACLU, and the American Jewish Congress. The NAACP took primary responsibility for Supreme Court cases (often led by lead NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall), with the ACLU focusing on police misconduct, and supporting the NAACP with amicus briefs. The NAACP achieved a key victory in 1950 with the Henderson v. United States decision that ended segregation in interstate bus and rail transportation.|$|E
5|$|After {{several years}} of {{comparatively}} weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that {{a bill of rights}} listing and guaranteeing <b>civil</b> <b>liberties</b> be included. Other delegatesincluding future Bill of Rights drafter James Madisondisagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of <b>civil</b> <b>liberties</b> were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.|$|E
