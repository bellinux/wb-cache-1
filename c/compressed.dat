5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using goats, which were <b>compressed</b> for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness. Goats which had been <b>compressed</b> to 2.25 bar absolute or less {{showed no signs of}} DCS after rapid decompression to the surface. Goats <b>compressed</b> to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed no signs of DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new lossless binary image compression method. The method {{consists of four}} stages: preprocessing, quadtree <b>compressing,</b> run length <b>compressing</b> and statistical model-based <b>compressing.</b> The preprocessing stage {{is to reduce the}} entropy of a binary image. In the quadtree <b>compressing</b> stage, a breadth first traversal (BFT) linear quadtree is used to <b>compress</b> the image. The run length <b>compressing</b> stage uses the run length method to encode the tree list and colour list of the BFT linear quadtree. The statistical model-based <b>compressing</b> stage applies the Huffman coding algorithm to <b>compress</b> the remaining data of the BFT linear quadtree further. Experimental results show that this method can provide an impressive compression result...|$|R

In the paper, {{in order}} to {{investigate}} the situation of impact on wet molding for straw of <b>compressing</b> speed and moisture ratio, {{and look for the}} inside law between them, closed <b>compress</b> experimental study on the wet molding for wheat straw pellet fuel was done by electrical universal material experimental machine and experimental provision made by oneself.

The result, which low <b>compressing</b> speed and low moisture ratio were propitious to wet molding, was gotten. The molding stage can be divided to loose stag, transitional stage, <b>compressing</b> stage. Partial elastic deformation mainly occurred In loose stage, and its mathematical model was linear equation. Elastic deformation mainly occurred In transitional stage, and its mathematical model was exponential equation. Plastic deformation mainly occurred In <b>compressing</b> stage, and its mathematical model was linear equation.

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the clinical effects of Thai herbal <b>compress.</b> Methods. International and Thai databases were searched from inception through September 2014. Comparative clinical studies investigating herbal <b>compress</b> for any indications were included.

Mean {{changes of the}} outcomes from baseline were compared between herbal <b>compress</b> and comparators by calculating mean difference. Results.

The overall effects of Thai herbal <b>compress</b> on reducing osteoarthritis (OA) and muscle pain were not {{different from those of}} nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, knee exercise, and hot <b>compress.</b> However, the reduction of OA pain in the herbal <b>compress</b> group tended to be higher than that of any comparators (weighted mean difference 0. 419; 95 % CI − 0. 004, 0. 842) with moderate heterogeneity (I 2 = 58. 3 %, P= 0. 048).
