40|$|Changes often happen {{during the}} process of the {{construction}} project. Main changes could be absence of workers, breakdown of machines, and adverse weather. These changes can impact the project at all kinds of levels. Meanwhile, the project manager needs to make appropriate decisions to minimize the impact of changes. Typical decisions would be re-allocation of resources and re-arrangement of the tasks. However, how to make appropriate decisions for change management is not easy to answer. In this context, we propose the Decision-based Change Management (DCM) approach as a change management tool to deal with the change scenarios in construction engineering. The DCM approach is intended to help the project managers (especially new project management practitioners) to assess the level of change impacts and select an appropriate <b>change</b> <b>option</b> for project revision. The DCM approach in this thesis is applied to the cases of sub-project of pipeline installation in the Wastewater Treatment Plant Project, which addresses how to find an appropriate <b>change</b> <b>option</b> to deal with the change scenarios concerning absence of the workers for a period of time. In specific, three change options are categorized for the DCM approach based on two types of schedule revision activities (Patch Actions & Repair Actions). When a change scenario occurs, three key change impact factors are used to estimate the level of change impact for this change scenario during the implement procedure of the DCM approach. Then, a proper <b>change</b> <b>option</b> can be chosen to revise the schedule based on the estimated level of change impact. At last, we propose evaluating two criteria (project delay and re-organization efforts) to examine the quality of the revised schedules. Experimental results of the cases indicate validity of the DCM approach to tackle most of the change scenarios concerning absence of the workers in the construction project. ...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous {{imbibition}} (SI) is {{the main}} recovery mechanism in low matrix perme- ability, naturally fractured reservoirs. However, for imbibition to occur, the reservoir rock should be preferentially water-wet. Several {{studies have indicated that}} smart water may increase the water-wetness of an oil-wet carbonate reservoirs. Published experimental data suggest that sulfate ion in the injected fluid can alter wetting state of the carbonate from preferentially oil-wet to water-wet. Numerical and analytical models have been developed to describe SI process in carbonate reservoirs. The suggested models attempt to capture the complex inter- actions among different phases and species during SI process. In this study, using the already existing surfactant model of ECLIPSE 100 simulator, dynamic e ect of adsorption of sulfate on wettability alteration in core scale is modelled. Wettability <b>change</b> <b>option</b> of the surfactant model is employed to capture change in wettability due to adsorption of sulfate ion. Using the procedure of weight factor, wettability of the core shifts dynamically from oil-wet to water-wet conditions proportional to the adsorbed amount of sulfate. Laboratory experiments have been matched with the established procedure. The result showed that the wettability <b>change</b> <b>option</b> under surfactant model in ECLIPSE 100 is capable of modelling the change in wettability due to adsorption of sulfate ion. The model is able to predict experimental data using the procedure of weight factor. Moreover, a correlation between weight factor and Amott wettability index is established.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{issue in the}} evolution of software models is change propagation: given a primary change that is made to a model in order to meet a new or changed requirement, what additional secondary changes are needed to maintain consistency within the model, and between the model and other models in the system? In practice, there are many ways of propagating changes to fix a given inconsistency, and how to justify and automate the selection between such <b>change</b> <b>options</b> remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a number of postulates, inspired by the mature belief revision theory, that a change propagation process should satisfy to be considered rational and minimal. Such postulates enable us to reason about selecting alternative <b>change</b> <b>options,</b> and consequently to develop a machinery that automatically performs this task. We further argue that a possible implementation of such a change propagation process can be considered as a classical state space search in which each state represents a snapshot of the model in the process. This view naturally reflects the cascading nature of change propagation, where each change can require further changes to be made...|$|R

40|$|New {{product design}} {{as well as}} design {{revision}} to remedy defects is complicated by an inability to precisely predict product performance. Designers often jind that they are conjident about the performance of some design alternatives and uncertain about others. Similarly, alternative design changes may differ substantially in uncertainty, potential impact, and cost. This paper describes a method for including the effects of uncertainty {{in the evaluation of}} economic benejits of various design change options. The results indicate that the most projitable <b>change</b> <b>option</b> sequence depends not only on relative costs but also on the relative degree of uncertainty and on the magnitude of the potential design defects. The method demonstrates how design change alternatives can be compared using the engineering design of a beam. Finally, the validity of some common engineering change heuristics are discussed relative to their associated, quantitatively determined limits. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 1561040...|$|E

However, the precise magnitudes of economic impacts of global warming as well as abatement and mitigation costs of climate change are not known and may be learned after time.
