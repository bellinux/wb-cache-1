5|$|Burnham {{was born}} on May 11, 1861 on a Dakota Sioux Indian {{reservation}} in Minnesota, to a missionary family living near the small pioneer town of Tivoli (now gone), about 20 miles (32km) from Mankato. His father, the Reverend Edwin Otway Burnham, was a Presbyterian minister educated and ordained in New York; {{he was born in}} Ghent, Kentucky. His mother Rebecca Russell Burnham had spent most of her childhood in Iowa, having emigrated with her family from Westminster, England at the age of three. In the Dakota War of 1862, Chief Little Crow and his Sioux warriors attacked the nearby town New Ulm, Minnesota; Burnham's father was in Mankato buying ammunition at the time, so when Burnham's mother saw Sioux approaching her cabin dressed in war paint, she knew she had to leave and could never escape carrying her baby. She hid Frederick in a basket of green corn husks in a <b>corn</b> <b>field</b> and fled for her life. Once the Sioux attack had been repulsed, she returned to find their house burned down, but the baby Frederick was safe, fast asleep in the basket with the corn husks.|$|E

25|$|A {{localized}} but damaging tornado outbreak produced 11 tornadoes {{in eastern}} North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota {{on the evening}} of August 26, 2007. A large EF3 tornado passed near Rugh Lake, North Dakota, destroying garages and outbuildings on three farms, tossing grain bins, and snapping numerous trees. Gravel roads were deeply scarred by flying debris, five bison were killed, and two heavy combines were thrown and smashed to pieces by the tornado. The strongest tornado of the outbreak was a large, rain-wrapped EF4 wedge that devastated the town of Northwood, North Dakota. This multiple-vortex tornado began to the southwest of town, snapping numerous trees and striking the Northwood Muni-Vince Airport at EF1 strength, where several planes were damaged. A metal storage building and a small airplane hangar were reduced to bare slabs at that location. The tornado grew to nearly a mile wide and reached EF3 strength as it struck Northwood directly. Of the roughly 460 homes in Northwood, 90% of them sustained some type of damage. The local health center, bank, fire station, school, supermarket, and grain elevator were all damaged. Near the grain elevator, several rail cars were knocked off the tracks. Hundreds of trees were snapped, uprooted, or damaged throughout town, and one person was killed in a mobile home park that was destroyed at the north edge of town. A small area of EF4 damage was noted as the tornado exited at the northeast corner of town. An agricultural company, a construction company, and a car dealership were completely destroyed in this area. The construction company was entirely flattened, with steel beams twisted and thrown into nearby fields. A large metal storage tank that originated in this area was found 1.5 miles away in a <b>corn</b> <b>field.</b> Numerous vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards from the car dealership, many of which were mangled beyond recognition. Farm fields in this area were heavily scoured, and mature corn stalks in one field were snapped at the base and flattened to the ground, with husked ears of corn found scattered about. EF1 damage was observed further to the northeast before the tornado dissipated. In addition to the fatality, 18 other people were injured in Northwood. Later that evening, an EF2 tornado touched down near Reynolds, North Dakota, snapping numerous trees near the Red River, and flattening a flag pole and an antique windmill to the ground. The tornado crossed into Minnesota, where a quonset hut and a pole shed were destroyed before the tornado dissipated near Eldred. Eight other weak tornadoes occurred that evening as well.|$|E

The ending scene was co-directed by Emmanuel Previnarie, Sze Kwan Chong and Marc Asmode, where they used a flying camera on a small helicopter to accomplish an aerial shot of Utada on the <b>corn</b> <b>field.</b> Regarding the female animation at the start, Utada believed it was a representation of her and further exclaimed their inspiration of the video was from the 1997 film Princess Mononoke; [...] "The people who were doing the on-the-spot filming seemed to have my sort of make.

500|$|Responsible for the film's {{production}} design was Rick Heinrichs, who Burton {{intended to use}} on Superman Lives. While the production crew {{was always going to}} build a substantial number of sets, the decision was taken early on that to fulfill Burton's vision best would necessitate shooting Sleepy Hollow in a totally controlled environment at Leavesden Film Studios. The {{production design}} was influenced [...] by Burton's love for Hammer Film Productions and Black Sunday—particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages. Heinrichs was also influenced by American colonial architecture, German Expressionism, Dr. Seuss illustrations, and Hammer's Dracula Has Risen from the Grave. One sound stage at Leavesden was dedicated to the [...] "Forest to Field" [...] set, for the scene in which the Headless Horseman races out of the woods and into a field. This stage was then transformed into, variously, a graveyard, a <b>corn</b> <b>field,</b> a field of harvested wheat, a churchyard, and a snowy battlefield. In addition, a small backlot area was devoted to a New York City street and waterfront tank.|$|E

500|$|Fitch {{continued}} {{to control the}} aircraft's descent by adjusting engine thrust. With the loss of all hydraulics, the crew were unable to control airspeed independent from sink rate. On final descent, the aircraft was going 220 knots and sinking at 1,850 feet per minute (approximately 407km/h forward and 34km/h downward speed), while a safe landing would require 140 knots and 300 feet per minute (approximately 260km/h and 5km/h respectively). Fitch needed a seat for landing; Dvorak offered up his own, {{as it could be}} moved to a position behind the throttles. Dvorak sat in the cockpit's jump seat for landing. Fitch noticed the high sink rate and that the plane started to yaw right again, and pushed the throttles to full power in an attempt to mitigate the high sink rate and level the plane. There wasn't enough time for the flight crew [...] to react. The tip of the right wing hit the runway first, spilling fuel, which ignited immediately. The tail section broke off from the force of the impact, {{and the rest of the}} aircraft bounced several times, shedding the landing gear and engine nacelles and breaking the fuselage into several main pieces. On the final impact, the right wing was shorn off and the main part of the aircraft skidded sideways, rolled over onto its back, and slid to a stop upside-down in a <b>corn</b> <b>field</b> to the right of Runway 22. Witnesses reported that the aircraft [...] "cartwheeled" [...] end-over-end, but the investigation did not confirm this. The reports were due to misinterpretation of the video of the crash that showed the flaming right wing tumbling end-over-end and the intact left wing, still attached to the fuselage, rolling up and over as the fuselage flipped over.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 12 October 1954 with a night shoot at Chessington Zoo and continued from 18 October 1954 into December. The budget was £42,000, low {{even by the}} standards of Hammer at the time. [...] Special effects technician Les Bowie recalled, [...] "We did Quatermass on a budget so low it wasn't a real budget. I did it for wages not as a proper effects man who gets allocated a certain budget for a movie". The shots of the emergency services rushing to the rocket crash site {{at the beginning of the}} movie were filmed in the village of Bray, Berkshire, where Hammer's studios were located. The scenes with the crashed rocket were shot in a <b>corn</b> <b>field</b> at Water Oakley, near Bray. It was originally intended to make the crash site look more spectacular by setting fire to the field but bad weather put paid to this idea. Guest used a wide-angle lens for these shots to convey a feeling of vastness to the scene. Carroon's encounter with the little girl was filmed at the East India Docks in London. A second unit, under cameraman Len Harris, conducted additional location shooting around London for the montage scenes of the police search for Carroon. For the shot of the lights of London going out when the electricity is diverted to Westminster Abbey, an agreement was made with one of the engineers at Battersea Power Station to turn off the lights illuminating the outside of the station; however the engineer misunderstood and briefly cut all the power along the River Thames. Most of the remaining location shooting was done in the Windsor area. The rest of the film was shot at Hammer's Bray Studios, with the New Stage there housing the sets for the hospital and the interior of Westminster Abbey. Michael Carreras had written to the Abbey seeking permission to film there but was refused. The rooms of Down Place, the former country house Bray Studios were built around, were used for other scenes such as Inspector Lomax's office. Art director James Elder Wills, in his final film for Hammer, made great use of the existing architecture of Down Place to enhance the effectiveness of his sets.|$|E

40|$|Mason, Charles E. The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, is an Asian {{species that}} now dominates the stink bug complex in many {{cultivated}} crops throughout the mid-Atlantic U. S. Sweet <b>corn</b> and <b>field</b> <b>corn</b> (Zea mays L.) are preferred host plants of H. halys, and the bug can cause kernel injury on developing ears. Currently, {{there is limited}} information available on which plant growth stages are most sensitive to H. halys feeding, or the density of bugs required to cause yield and quality reductions on sweet <b>corn</b> and <b>field</b> <b>corn.</b> In 2011 and 2012, sweet <b>corn</b> and <b>field</b> <b>corn</b> ears were infested at different growth stages: R 1 (silking), R 2 (blister), R 3 (milk), and R 4 (dough, <b>field</b> <b>corn</b> only) at densities of zero, one, three, and five H. halys adults per ear for seven days. At harvest, four sweet <b>corn</b> and three <b>field</b> <b>corn</b> yield measurements were assessed and ears were inspected for quality reductions. In sweet corn, the greatest yield loss from H. halys occurred when infestations were initiated during early stages of ear development (R 1 and R 2), and the greatest quality reductions (damaged kernels) occurred during later stages of ear development (R 2 and R 3). In <b>field</b> <b>corn,</b> the greatest yield losses and quality reductions occurred when infestations were initiated at R 3. A density of one H. halys per ear resulted in levels of kernel damage great enough to cause significant quality reductions in both sweet <b>corn</b> and <b>field</b> <b>corn.</b> This study highlights the ability of H. halys to cause substantial economic losses in both sweet <b>corn</b> and <b>field</b> <b>corn</b> {{in a relatively short}} period of time at low population densities. Therefore, infestations by this insect must be considered when making pest management decisions in regions where it has become established.
