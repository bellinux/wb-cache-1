40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines literary {{representations of}} the Partition of India in 1947 as it affected the southern princely state of Hyderabad, Deccan. Through my focus on Hyderabad, I interrogate and reject the assumption generally made in scholarly analyses of Partition that this momentous, life-changing event did not significantly affect South India. In doing so, I also question {{the origins of the}} self-professed secular, egalitarian, and democratic Indian nation by shedding light on the invasion of Hyderabad and the subsequent erasure of this event from Indian historiography and mainstream culture. Different literary texts respond differently to this fraught, suppressed history. Engaging with questions about gendered and classed violence, trauma, and silence, I study three literary texts written several decades after Partition: Anita Desai’s novel Clear Light of Day (1980, English), Samina Ali’s novel Madras on Rainy Days (2004, English), and Kishorilal Vyas “Neelkanth’s” short story “Durga” (2005, Hindi). In my analysis, I utilize the theorizations of Partition scholars such as Jill Didur and Nandi Bhatia about how literature destabilizes the hegemony of mainstream and official narratives of cataclysmic historical events such as Partition. I also draw on Didur’s argument that literature not only has the power to upturn such historical narratives, which silence alternative narratives, but that literature itself must also be scrutinized as a narrative, ideologically motivated and politically interested. Retrospectively engaging in different measures with Partition, Hyderabad, and communalism, each literary text in my corpus points to the ongoing impact of Partition on Hyderabadis and throws crucial light on the issues of citizenship, class, gender, and narrative in the context of Partition and Hyderabad. In the process, they demonstrate/expose the implicit as well as explicit assumption in Partition Studies that the South was immune to the cartographic <b>cracking</b> of <b>India...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to do close {{readings}} of the Pakistani author Bapsi Sidhwa’s novels The Pakistani Bride and <b>Cracking</b> <b>India.</b> It sheds light on {{the ways in which}} the image of the female body is used in the two novels and in what ways this image represents the novels’ feminist message. The close readings reveal many similarities between the novels’ treatment of the female body, but also interesting developments that take place in Sidhwa’s feminism from The Pakistani Bride of the 1970 s to <b>Cracking</b> <b>India</b> of the 1980 s. The Pakistani Bride focuses on female suffering and the powerlessness experienced by women within the patriarchal society depicted. The suffering is linked closely to the female body, and the control exercised over it by male society. The female protagonists of the novel rebel against patriarchy, but in spite of this male control takes over in the end. The novel does not change the society in which it is set, but it does show the reader a reality which must be told. <b>Cracking</b> <b>India</b> is a more optimistic novel than The Pakistani Bride. The novel focuses on the cracks in the patriarchal system – cracks that can be used for self realisation or for the common good. The women of the novel all perform their own acts of rebellion or challenge to patriarchy and, even though some of them are punished for their independence, the novel still lets these women speak and be heard at the end of the story. <b>Cracking</b> <b>India</b> opens for a future in which women will be able to look at the world through their own eyes and gather their own knowledge and power. The feminism of The Pakistani Bride and <b>Cracking</b> <b>India</b> is a feminism which aims to break the silence regarding the oppression of women in Pakistan. Since the novels set out to inform and shock the reader into action, the feminism has a focus on the description of the different ways on which female bodies are oppressed in the patriarchal society of the novels. Because the female body is something that is supposed to be hidden and not talked about, showing abuse and injustice through the female body makes the message doubly powerful. The novels’ focus on injustice and violence aim to enrage the reader into taking action. The eyes of women looking at the world are introduced as an inspiration to women of patriarchal societies to question traditions, to gain their own knowledge of the world and to assert their intellectual power...|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{focus on}} {{literary}} {{representations of the}} partition of British India in 1947 during which approximately one million people were massacred, eight to ten million people were displaced, and women of minority communities were systematically raped, mutilated and humiliated. I draw on novels such as Attia Hosain 2 ̆ 7 s Sunlight on a Broken Column (1961) and Bapsi Sidhwa 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Cracking</b> <b>India</b> (1991), set during partition, {{to show how the}} framework of nationalism relied on specific and normative constructions of gender, sexuality, class, and religious identity.

By examining the testimonials of survivors though feminist approaches to shame, I illustrate some of the gaps in literary representations of partition violence that were primarily written by middle-class authors in order to show how we can read resistance by the survivors. In the second half my dissertation, the focus shifts from the survivors to the perpetrators and the continuation of such violence (usually dubbed 2 ̆ 2 riots 2 ̆ 2) in contemporary India. I draw on moral and social/political philosophers, such as Immanuel Kant and Hannah Arendt, and postcolonial theorists to uncover the ways in which the perpetrators have sought to legitimize the violence which I analyze as repeated expressions of their entitlement to national membership, majority religious identity, and normative construction of gender and sexuality. ...|$|E
40|$|Women Writing Independence, Partition and Communal Violence {{explores the}} {{important}} role literature has played in interrogating and supplementing historical accounts of women's experiences of Independence and Partition. It analyses how fiction highlights recurrent absences and inconsistencies in most historical accounts {{with regard to the}} significance of 1947 to women. Chapter One, Representing Partition, considers the descriptions of women's lives in the mid- 1940 s in historical texts, newspaper accounts and autobiographies. It emphasises how the effects of events upon women have often been elided or understated. Chapter Two, Gestures of Defiance and Subversion, focuses on Attia Hosain's Sunlight on a Broken Column (1961) and Anita Desai's Clear Light of Day (1980). It examines their portrayal of women's status in Indian society pre and post- 1947 and investigates whether national freedom was matched by equal progress in the rights of women. Chapter Three, Woman as Sign, concentrates on Jyotirmoyee Devi's The River Churning (1967) and Bapsi Sidhwa's <b>Cracking</b> <b>India</b> (1988). It explores how Devi and Sidhwa delineate the repercussions for women of the brutalities of 1946 - 47. It contends that these novels' particular strengths lie in their revelations of women's lives after assault/abduction and of their participation in social work. Chapter Four, Learningfrom Past Lives, analyses Manju Kapur's Difficult Daughters (1998) and Shauna Singh Baldwin's What the Body Remembers (1999). It scrutinises how the texts present the transmission of memories across generations and how family or community recollections can unsettle selective and sanitised versions of history. This thesis underlines the vital function of literature in depicting the direct impact of this cataclysm upon women in 1947 and in the decades thereafter.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} role of humor in contemporary South Asian and African postcolonial literature, arguing that humor opens new spaces for historically marginalized individuals to be heard. I argue {{that in addition to}} its unique capacities to question and rebel against colonial authority, humor helps those who deploy it to resist victimhood and enact a psychological rebellion against the circumstances of colonialism and its legacies, and facilitates a sense of community through laughter among both those who deploy it and those who enjoy it as audience members. I establish a theoretical framework based in the work of Aristotle, Henri Bergson, Sigmund Freud and Mikhail Bakhtin, then analyze four modes of humor [...] satire, irony, black humor, and the grotesque [...] as they are incorporated in Ngũgĩ wa Thiong 2 ̆ 7 o 2 ̆ 7 s Wizard of the Crow (Kenya, 2007); Arundhati Roy 2 ̆ 7 s The God of Small Things (India, 1997); Bapsi Sidhwa 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Cracking</b> <b>India</b> (Pakistan; first published in 1988 as Ice-Candy Man); Manjula Padmanabhan 2 ̆ 7 s play Harvest (India, 1997); Aravind Adiga 2 ̆ 7 s The White Tiger (India, 2008); Indra Sinha 2 ̆ 7 s Animal 2 ̆ 7 s People (India, 2008) and Ousmane Sembène 2 ̆ 7 s Xala (Senegal, 1973).

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{question}} of “identity” in feminism through an intertextual reading of African-American and Pakistani women’s writing. Its comparative approach to women-centred counter-narratives is also informed by a transnational, postcolonial frame alert to continuities between colonialism and neocolonialism. Although “identity” has become less central in some current linguistic and ontological modes of feminist inquiry, given the enduring relevance of identities both as social meaning-making processes and as repressive political categories, this thesis reshifts focus towards identities by foregrounding their emancipatory potential for feminist politics. Through critical engagement with Judith Butler’s and Allison Weir’s theories of relationality and with the epistemological and ontological dimensions of selected counter-narratives, this thesis reconceives identities as relations of interconnection and interdependence, thus encompassing but also moving beyond definitions in terms of restrictive social categories. Through investigating the (re) narration of histories and (re) presentation of discourses in Harriet Jacobs’s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861), Toni Morrison’s Beloved (1987), Bapsi Sidhwa’s <b>Cracking</b> <b>India</b> (1991), and Kamila Shamsie’s Burnt Shadows (2009), the thesis seeks to develop a relational conception of identities, agency, and coalition in a feminist historicist, relational framework. As well as expanding the sparse comparative scholarship on Pakistani and American literatures, this study considers the peculiar positionality of African-Americans vis-à-vis other “postcolonial” groups {{in the emergence of}} the U. S. as a neocolonial power. A valuable lens for understanding such transnational politics is found in a feminist analysis of the intersecting histories of racism and imperialism and their contemporary neocolonial manifestations. The contribution of this thesis is thus twofold: it newly brings together the arenas of African-American and Pakistani women’s counter-narratives that renegotiate identities and histories in relational terms; in doing so, it also starts to imagine an anti-imperialist transnational feminist political paradigm that conceives individual and collective identities and political alliances within a relational social ontology. ...|$|E
40|$|Melodrama and the Secular Subject argues that, {{if in the}} West, melodrama {{emerged as}} {{templates}} of moral virtue and action {{to cope with the}} void once occupied by the authority of the Church and Monarchy, in postcolonial and transnational contexts this argument is turned on its head: melodrama generates models of secular relationality through affective networks of public culture. I situate melodramatic representation in relation to the emergence of the Indian nation as a new global power and the violent assertion of its government as a security state. The changes wrought by recent policies favoring neoliberalization and communal or religious extremism intersect as the popularity of Indian film industries present themselves as crucial nodes in the national and global mediascape. Furthermore, the dissertation argues that India's postcolonial predicament lies in the state's inability to resolve its contradictory definitions of secularism and citizenship. The state's conflicting definitions of secularism [...] as separation of state and religion, on the one hand, as respect for religious difference, on the other [...] result in an impasse resolved through the violent disavowal of gendered and other difference and the imposition of a single de-facto masculinist Hindu identity. State secular policy casts minoritized women and subaltern groups as the nation's failed citizen subjects, thereby producing a subaltern spectral citizenry. Constituting an aesthetics of "failure," the dissertation argues that those very narrative and aesthetic features used to denigrate postcolonial fiction and Bollywood film melodrama as unrealistic, excessive, and escapist, such as coincidence, impersonation, doublings, and flashbacks, though resembling irrational failures of realist representation, offer alternative concepts of temporality and ethical understanding. Through strategies of public consumption and spectatorial address, the melodramatic representations the dissertation examines, such as Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children, Deepa Mehta's film adaptation, Earth, of Bapsi Sidhwa's novel <b>Cracking</b> <b>India,</b> and Manil Suri's novel Death of Vishnu throw into crisis the very category of citizenship. The circuits of affect and action produced in this traffic of melodramatic texts highlight the importance of moving beyond understandings of popular culture as false consciousness or mass culture to public culture, a new site for political expression and intervention. i...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of English, Washington State UniversityMy {{dissertation}} examines acts {{of seeing}} and {{looking in the}} late colonial and newly postcolonial societies of twentieth-century South Asia and Ireland. It argues that such acts are instrumental for maintaining, resisting, and destabilizing the dynamics of power existing between representatives of British imperial power and colonized populations. Fictional representations of these dynamics {{of power and the}} contested spaces wherein these power dynamics are at play abound within the twentieth-century novel. By presenting readers with the complete, albeit distanced, gazes of third-person omniscient narrators or the more immediate and personal gazes of first-person narrators, the form of the novel encourages readers to perform the role of spectator. This project focuses upon two specific acts of looking [...] acts of surveillance and acts of spectatorship [...] as they are fictionalized in selected Irish and South Asian novels. My hypothesis is that the necessity for engaging in surveillance and spectatorship is heightened in the contested spaces of late colonial and newly postcolonial societies because resistance and challenges to the established order [...] either that of the imperial ruler or that of the post-imperial political regime [...] is also heightened. The form of the novel is especially useful for an analysis of how acts of surveillance and spectatorship impact existing dynamics of power because narrative mirrors the practice of surveillance by encouraging readers to engage in acts of seeing and looking. Ultimately, what is at stake is determining the ways in which acts of seeing and looking along with the form of the novel identify methods by which individuals or groups of individuals in fictionalized colonial and postcolonial societies mount resistance to the political, social, or cultural power with which surveilling entities are endowed and in so doing resist and dismantle oppressive political and social institutions and regimes.

40|$|This thesis explores {{representations}} {{of children with}} disabilities in recent postcolonial fictions from New Zealand, Africa and South Asia. It contends that while disabled characters appear frequently within postcolonial texts, disability is rarely considered critically within postcolonial literary studies and that this is a significant omission. In turn, humanities-based disabilitY studies has not yet paid adequate attention to conceptions of disability arising from non-Western cultura. 1 contexts. In order to begin to address these theoretical elisions, I apply disability theory in my textual analysis, interrogating how disability intervenes. in, and facilitates, critical fictional engagements with postcolonial cultural histories. My research focuses specifically on the figure of the exceptional child who, in postcolonial Iiter?ry criticism, is typically interpreted in metaphorical terms {{as a symbol of the}} vulnerable or damaged postcolonial community or nation. While current literary disability theory similarly. ' proposes. that disability is most often deployed within fiction as a metaphorical device, and is inevitably depoliticised in the process, I examine the materialist explorations of normalcy, embodiment and health that occur in my selected texts. I identify how disability is mobilised as a material, socially situated presence which enables the writers' cultural critiques. This thesis is divided into six chapters, each examining a novel with a disabled child protagonist. The first two chapters, on Patricia Grace's Potiki (1986) and Ken Hulme's the bone people (1983), consider disability in relation to indigenous cultural politics in New Zealand; Chapters Three and Four engage with the intersections between disability and gender in Tsitsi Dangarembga's Nervous Conditions (1988) and Bapsi Sidhwa's <b>Cracking</b> <b>India</b> (1991); and the final two chapters, focusing on Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (1981) and Ben Okri's The Famished Road (1991), explore postmodernist {{representations of}} exceptionality. My analysis demonstrates that these texts repres~nt disability in politicised, situated and unsentimental terms, an approach that is necessitated by the complex cultural histories in which the fictions are located. I conclude that further collaborations between postcolonial studies and disability studies are essential in order to advance current thinking on disability in non-Western contexts and to expand postcolonial theory's attention to conditions of difference.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of {{representations}} of cultural and political identity in a selection of literary and cinematic texts (in English and in regional South-Asian languages in translation), all of which situate South-Asian cultural and political subjectivity in relation to specific narrative constructions of space. I suggest that through these successive depictions {{it is possible to}} plot narratives of belonging. Furthermore, in each chapter I explore these constructions of homeland at different nodal points in the history of colonial and independent South-Asia, and trace out their aesthetic and geopolitical implications. In my first chapter I address a wide variety of nineteenth century colonial and indigenous writings, including William Lambton's and George Everest's records of the cartographic surveying of India, Honoria Lawrence's and Harriet Tytler's personal journals, and Mirza Ghalib's poetry and prose written during the 1857 rebellion. These contemporary narratives are framed against Satyajit Ray's cinematic adaptation of Premchand's historical short story, The Chess-Players (1977). My second chapter investigates constructions of national and cultural belonging which develop out of representations of village-life in novels written during the struggle for Indo-Pakistani independence, namely; Bibhutibhushan Banerji's Pather Panchali (1928) in translation, Mulk Raj Anand's The Village (1940) and Raja Rao's Kanthapura (1938). Again, I examine South-Asian cinema, in this case Satyajit Ray's post-colonial filmic reworking of Banerji's novel. In my third chapter I analyse representations of Partition in Sadat Hasan Manto's Urdu short-stories (published in the aftermath of Partition) and in Intizar Husain's historical novel, Basti (1979) - in both cases working from translations of the original texts. Also covering Partition writings in English, I examine Khushwant Singh's Train to Pakistan (1956) and Bapsi Sidhwa's <b>Cracking</b> <b>India</b> (1988). My final chapter deals with metropolitan post-colonial identities and the Indian Emergency of 1975, in Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (1981) and Nayantara Sahgal's Rich Like Us (1985). Throughout the thesis, whilst underlining the political salience of cultural constructions such as identity and belonging, I also maintain a theoretical perspective which attempts to show how these narratives are continually shadowed by the fact of cross-cultural transaction and slippage. In discourses which are constructed upon a more or less ambivalent implementation of difference, such as colonialism and certain forms of nationalism, I focus on the way in which these narratives are modified, negotiated, or transgressed across their own borders. In contemporary postcolonial writings I argue that homeland has become a more flexible concept, and underline the way cross-cultural negotiation has developed as a means of identity and belonging in itself...|$|E

This thesis analyses the ways in which four selected Anglophone contemporary novels by Indian and Pakistani writers refer to, represent and discuss historical and contemporary events that have repeatedly been categorized as examples of ‘religious violence,’ i. e. violent conflicts where the religious identities of both perpetrators and victims were the major reason or pretense for their involvement in those conflicts. The four novels analyzed in this thesis and the events they refer to are Bapsi Sidhwa’s <b>Cracking</b> <b>India</b> (1991) about Partition 1947, Shashi Tharoor’s Riot (2001) about the riots accompanying the Ram Janmabhumi campaign in the early 1990 s, Raj Kamal Jha’s Fireproof (2006) about the anti-Muslim pogrom in Gujarat 2002, and Salman Rushdie’s Shalimar the Clown (2005) about the Kashmir conflict. Embedded as they are in the ‘real,’ empirical world, these novels engage with and respond to what they are surrounded by — a world abounding with violence and violent conflicts which seem to be directly related to religion in one way or another. Drawing on the debates about the question of religion’s relation to violence in different fields and conscientiously factoring in the specific historical contexts that the novels refer to and were written in, this study aims at identifying {{the ways in which the}} four selected examples of literary fiction represent, respond to and discuss historical instances of religious violence and how they negotiate the relation between religion and the violence they describe. This thesis’ overarching question is how these novels, representing those violent events on a fictional level, position themselves regarding the relation between religion, religious alterity, hostile Othering and violence. The approach to answering my principal question importantly involves looking at the ways in which these fictional texts refer to and include contemporary public discourses on the topic of religion’s relation to violence in India. In this respect, I am especially interested in literary representations and negotiations of the complex dynamics of marginalization, repression or silencing of memories of traumatizing events in dominant discourses in the public domain. My central hypothesis is that by way of narrating specific instances of religiously connoted violence, the novels scrutinize and highlight processes of hostile Othering {{on the basis of}} religious alterity and thereby bring to the fore its consequences both for the individuals directly involved and society as a whole. I contend that these novels deplore the status of religious alterity as singular category of perceiving the socio-cultural ‘Other’ and, by virtue of providing a multifaceted, complex image of India’s and Pakistan’s inhabitants, argue for a conceptual pluralization of identities and illustrate the advantages of perceiving others not as same but instead as diversely different...|$|E
