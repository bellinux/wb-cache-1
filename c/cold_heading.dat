40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. A {{large number}} of NGAS high {{efficiency}} coolers (HEC) have been manufactured for six different space payload designs using a linear configuration <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> that is integrally mounted to the compressor. One of the payloads has been in orbital operation since 2005 and a second since 2009. For some applications it may be desirable {{to have a different}} <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> mechanical and thermal interface in order to ease integration into the system. For that purpose we have developed both one and two stage HEC coolers that incorporate coaxial <b>cold</b> <b>heads</b> that are integrally mounted to the compressor. The single thermal and mechanical mounting interface of this integral configuration eases integration with a payload and reduces its complexity compared to a split <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> version that requires two warm interfaces rather than one. In this paper we present the measured performance of the single stage HEC coaxial <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> cooler in its integral configuration and compare its performance with the linear <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> version.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{industrial}} cold forging processes is <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> of steel wire or rod to produce screws, bolts, nuts and rivets. The process is limited by a complicated interplay of many factors. The cold work (pre-drawing) is one of them. Although several investigations into the effects of pre-drawing on the formability of metals during <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> processes have been conducted, so far no attention has been given to the numerical simulations of this phenomenon. The current work aims at examining effects of pre-drawing on formability during <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> through numerical simulations. Physical tests in the literature investigating the effects of pre-drawing on the formability of three metals are simulated using ABAQUS 6. 4, with three successive FE models: the drawing model, the cutting model and the upsetting model. A new combined linear kinematic/nonlinear isotropic hardening constitutive model is proposed and derived to account for the Bauschinger effect existing in reverse plastic deformation. The new model is implemented into ABAQUS/Explicit v 6. 4 by a user subroutine VUMAT, which is verified by one-element numerical tests under tension, compression and reverse loading conditions. In addition, for the purpose of comparison, the Johnson-Cook isotropic hardening model is also applied for the materials. The Cockroft and Latham criterion is employed to predict surface fracture. Although considerable discrepancies between the experimental and simulation results are observed, the proposed combined hardening model is more accurate in predicting material behavior in the reverse loading than the Johnson-Cook isotropic hardening model. In addition, the simulation results show that the proposed combined hardening material model has the potential to correctly predict the material behavior in the reverse loading process...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{mechanism}} of void and microcrack formation along the adiabatic shear bands (ASB) was studied for processing dual phase steel by <b>cold</b> <b>heading.</b> Experimental investigation along with finite element simulation has confirmed that this mechanism depends on two types of instabilities, namely geometrical and thermal instabilities. The geometric instability occurs {{in the presence of}} second phase particles (inclusions) and in relation to the material flow orientation, whilst the thermal softening arises due to the localized plastic deformation inside the ASB. Progressive deformation was observed to cause the elongation of voids in the direction of shearing that formed microcracks in the ASB of the cold headed specimen. In addition, transformed bands were observed in the highly deformed zones {{as a result of the}} temperature in the ASB exceeding the Ac 3 transformation temperature 8470 C. The superposition of the location of the ASB region containing the voids and micro-cracks with the phase transformation zone indicates that the development of optimized processing conditions is particularly critical for preventing fracture during <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> of dual phase steels.

40|$|The {{advantage}} of cryocooler {{is the small}} size of its <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> due to this it can be mounted on top of a Dewar, thus reducing overall size of the liquefier setup making it possible to use it in demanding sites and laboratories where the consumption of liquid nitrogen is not in higher quantities. So the dewar which is mostly used to store liquid cryogen, here is used for production and storage purposes. A cryocooler based Nitrogen liquefaction system was designed and developed which can be an ideal solution to the liquid nitrogen usage in laboratories. This setup uses a Cryomech Single stage Gifford-Mcmahon cryocooler to provide cooling and condensation of nitrogen at 80 K with the refrigeration capacity of 266 W (Rated) at 80 K and a dewar specially fabricated with wider neck than usual dewar to accommodate <b>cold</b> <b>head.</b> The Gifford-Mcmahon cryocooler consist of compressor package, Helium Flex lines and <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> which is {{the heart and soul of}} this setup. The <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> is mounted into the top of the dewar and it extends down into the neck of the dewar for the purpose of cooling the nitrogen entering the dewar to 80 K (- 193 ºC) at 0. 5 bar gauge pressure which is the operating pressure for this dewar. The nitrogen gas liquefies on contact with the <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> heat exchanger. The liquefied nitrogen drips off the heat exchanger down into the dewar. This process would typically lower the pressure inside the dewar, but the regulator allows more nitrogen gas to enter the dewar to maintain the pressure at the preset level. The flow rate of the nitrogen gas into the dewar is controlled by the rate of liquefaction inside the dewar. In the experimental dewar maximum liquefaction rate of 74 Ltr/day and in the main dewar liquefaction rate of 64 Ltr/day were achieved. The difference in liquefaction rate was due to the high radiation load coming on cryogen reservoir of main dewar...|$|R
40|$|As low {{temperature}} cryocoolers become more frequently used to cool superconducting magnets, it becomes increasingly {{apparent that the}} connection between the cooler and the magnet has an effect on the design and performance of the magnet. In general, the use of small coolers can be considered in two different temperature ranges; (1) from 3. 8 to 4. 8 K for magnet fabricated with LTS conductor and (2) from 18 to 35 K for magnets fabricated using HTS conductor. In general, both temperature ranges call for the use of a two-stage cooler. The best method for connecting a cooler to the magnet depends on a number of factors. The factors include: (1) whether the cooler must be used to cool down the magnet from room temperature, (2) whether the magnet must have one or more reservoirs of liquid cryogen to keep the magnet cold during a loss of cooling, and (3) constraints on the distance from the cooler <b>cold</b> <b>heads</b> and the magnet and its shield.
