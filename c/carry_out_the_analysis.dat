Ideally there should be at least 10 times as many candidate items as the desired final length of the test, and several times more people in the sample than there are items in the pool. A variety of statistical procedures are applied to the responses to the candidate items, in order to eliminate unsatisfactory items. For example, under classical test theory, items will be eliminated if the answers to them: ...|$|E
50|$|Many {{spectral}} {{methods in}} the past have been called upon the spectral decomposition of a covariance matrix to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis.</b> A very important breakthrough came about when the eigen-structure of the covariance matrix was explicitly invoked, and its intrinsic properties were directly used to provide a solution to an underlying estimation problem for a given observed process. A class of spatial spectral estimation techniques is based on the eigen-value decomposition of the spatial covariance matrix. The rationale behind this approach is that one wants to emphasize the choices for the steering vector a(θ) which correspond to signal directions. The method exploits the property that the directions of arrival determine the eigen structure of the matrix.The tremendous interest in the subspace based methods is mainly due to the introduction of the MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification) algorithm. MUSIC was originally presented as a DOA estimator, then it has been successfully brought back to the spectral analysis/system identification problem with it is later development.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} method is based on optical near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) where the optical absorbance, i.e. the fraction of intensity of the incident light that is absorbed by the oil sample, is used to estimate the oil acidity. An oil sample is placed in a cuvette and analyzed by a spectrophotometer {{on a wide range of}} wavelengths. The results (i.e. the absorbance data for every tested wavelength) are thus processed by a statistical algorithm, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Partial Least Squares regression (PLS), to estimate the oil acidity. The feasibility to measure olive oil free acidity and peroxide value by NIR spectroscopy in the wavenumber range 4,541 to 11,726 cm−1 was reported. Many commercial spectrophotometers exist [...] that can be used for analysis of different quality parameters in olive oil. The main advantage of NIR spectroscopy is the possibility to <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> on raw olive oil samples, without any chemical pretreatment. The main drawbacks are the high cost of commercial spectrophotometer and the need of calibration for different types of oil (produced by olives of different varieties, different geographical origin, etc.).|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The {{majority}} of radioelectronic systems are hardware-software systems. Their reliability {{is defined as}} the reliability of hardware and software. Methods for estimating software allow to predict reliability based on experiments and tests during the testing verification and validation time, but there is no specific models for assessing the reliability during operation time. Problem statement. In many approaches, when assessing the reliability of hardware-software systems consider that software reliability is equal to 1, and consider only reliability of hardware. In other approaches consider that the reliability of PAS depends on the software and hardware reliability. Hardware and software features differ significantly. Important is to create methodology for determining the reliability of hardware-software systems considering hardware and software adequate models. Developing software reliability models.
