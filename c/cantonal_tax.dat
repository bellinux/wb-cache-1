40|$|In {{response}} to the increasing international pressure on Switzerland to reform the ring-fenced elements in its tax system, the Swiss Government has put forward a comprehensive tax reform package. The proposal comprises, among other things, {{the introduction of a}} licence box, a substantial reduction in the <b>cantonal</b> profit <b>tax</b> rates and an allowance for excess corporate equity. We apply a computable general equilibrium model to quantify the economic effects of this reform. Our results reveal that the licence box, combined with the reduction in the <b>cantonal</b> profit <b>tax,</b> limits the outflow of the tax base of those companies that benefit from the current preferential tax treatment. The reduction in the <b>cantonal</b> profit <b>tax</b> and the fact that regularly taxed companies also benefit from the licence box render the reform package costly, such that the tax revenues will decline after the reform...|$|R

After creditors pursued him he moved his family to the Engadin valley (altitude 5,954 feet/1,815 meters) in another part of Switzerland.

5000|$|The basic right {{protected}} by the constitution is that of public confession of adherence to a religious community {{and the performance of}} religious cult activities. Article 36 of the constitution introduces a limitation of these rights if they conflict with public interest or if they encroach upon the basic rights of others. Thus, ritual slaughter is prohibited as conflicting with Swiss animal laws. Performance of cultic or missionary activities or religious processions on public ground may be limited. The Jesuit order was banned from all activity on Swiss soil from 1848 to 1973. The use of <b>cantonal</b> <b>taxes</b> to support <b>cantonal</b> churches (which has been argued as constituting a breach of [...] "negative" [...] religious freedom) has been ruled legal by the Federal Supreme Court.

25|$|Switzerland is {{a federal}} {{republic}} in which {{the sovereignty of the}} constituent states (the cantons) is limited by the enumerated powers delegated to the federal state (the Confederation) through the federal constitution. Consequently, the original authority to levy taxes is vested in the individual cantons of Switzerland through their constitutions. Within the bounds of the authority delegated to them by cantonal law, the municipalities may also levy taxes. The extent of that authority varies from canton to canton. While the formal framework of the most important <b>cantonal</b> direct <b>taxes</b> has been harmonised through the 1990 Federal Tax Harmonisation Law, the cantons (and, as the case may be, the municipalities) remain free to set their tax rates or establish new taxes, except on tax objects already taxed under federal law.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{responsibility}} for funding and organising {{private and public}} transport systems in Switzerland is shared between the federal, the cantonal and the municipal level. Due to the spe-cific character of transport, mainly its non-territorial or “mobile ” character, co-ordination among the different government levels {{is at the same}} time essential and very difficult. This pa-per investigates into the funding of road infrastructures and the respective distribution of re-sponsibilities and resources across different levels of government. It compares a number of em-pirical data from the current funding framework with normative rules set by fiscal federalism and other public finance theories. The paper has three sections: a first section compares ear-marked taxes with road expenditures across the three government levels. A second section pres-ents a cross-sectoral analysis of <b>cantonal</b> vehicle <b>taxes</b> and <b>cantonal</b> road expenditures. The third section sets the federal road subsidies to the cantons against the spillovers resulting from intercantonal road traffic. Although in general the present road funding system with earmarked fuel and vehicle taxes is adequate, it presents a number of shortcomings. Funding is overcen-tralized, i. e. it gives the federal level too much influence on infrastructural issues in the canton...|$|R
