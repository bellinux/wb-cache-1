This method splits the building into stories, and the vertical structures of each story into masonry panels, which are analyzed individually by a new push-over analysis. The behavior of each panel is reproduced with an evolutive strut-and-tie model, which simulates the uncracked and cracked behavior of the panel subjected to a vertical constant force and a lateral force that increases up to the complete development of the failure mechanism. The evolutive strut-and-tie model provides the <b>capacity</b> <b>curve</b> of the panel. The composition of the capacity curves of all the panels of a story provides the <b>capacity</b> <b>curve</b> of this story. The capacity curves of all {{the stories of the}} building can be used to obtain either the maximum drift that the building can withstand or the behavior factor of the structure.

The proposed method is applied to a school building. The comparison between seismic safety assessed with this method and with a linear dynamic analysis, all other parameters being equal, shows that the latter approach is overly-conservative.
