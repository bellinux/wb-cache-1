5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if <b>company</b> <b>A</b> wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and <b>company</b> <b>A</b> is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, <b>company</b> <b>A</b> was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
