40|$|This study {{provides}} an overview of policy measures targeting pharmaceutical expenditure in Europe and analyses their impact on originator pharmaceutical prices. Panel data methods are used to examine the market of ACE Inhibitors in six European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom) over period 1991 - 2006. We find that although some measures are effective in reducing originator prices, others appear to have an insignificant effect. Results suggest that supply side measures such as mandatory generic substitution, regressive pharmacy mark-ups and <b>claw-backs</b> are effective in reducing pharmaceuticals prices. Results are not as strong for demand side measures. Profit controls and the use of cost-effectiveness analysis appear to {{have a negative effect on}} prices, while results on reference pricing are inconclusive. Findings also indicate that, although originator prices are not immediately affected by generic entry, they may be influenced by changes in generic prices post patent expiry...|$|R

50|$|Current {{vehicle bodies}} are {{designed}} around the mechanicals of existing engine/transmission setups. It is restrictive {{and far from}} ideal to install petro-hydraulic mechanicals into existing bodies not designed for hydraulic setups. One research project's {{goal is to create}} a blank paper design new car, to maximize the packaging of petro-hydraulic hybrid components in the vehicle. All bulky hydraulic components are integrated into the chassis of the car. One design has claimed to return 130 mpg in tests by using a large hydraulic accumulator which is also the structural chassis of the car. The small hydraulic driving motors are incorporated within the wheel hubs driving the wheels and reversing to <b>claw-back</b> kinetic braking energy. The hub motors eliminates the need for friction brakes, mechanical transmissions, drive shafts and U joints, reducing costs and weight. Hydrostatic drive with no friction brakes are used in industrial vehicles. The aim is 170 mpg in average driving conditions. Energy created by shock absorbers and kinetic braking energy that normally would be wasted assists in charging the accumulator. A small fossil fuelled piston engine sized for average power use charges the accumulator. The accumulator is sized at running the car for 15 minutes when fully charged. The aim is a fully charged accumulator which will produce a 0-60 mph acceleration speed of under 5 seconds using four wheel drive.|$|E

We study a broadly appli-cable principal agent setting, in which the agent exerts effort for an immediately observable task (acquisition) and a task for which information is only gradually available over time (diligence). Optimal compensation contracts trade off the cost and benefit of delay resulting from agent impatience and the informational gain.

In particular, higher acquisition incentives make it more likely that deferral regulation increases equilibrium diligence.

40|$|In this Article, I {{offer some}} {{considerations}} on a possible compromising {{solution for the}} controversy between the European Union (EU) and the United States (U. S.) on the regulation of geographical indications of origin (GIs) {{as part of the}} negotiations in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Notably, I advocate that the EU and the U. S. consider adopting a solution similar to that adopted in the Canada and European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). In particular, I note that, even though CETA accepted several of the EU’s requests to <b>claw-back</b> names that were not previously protected in Canada, it also includes important exceptions to balance the effect of this <b>claw-back</b> process with respect to several (highly contested) names at issue. Thus, the solution adopted in CETA represents a win–win solution for Canada and the EU, and a similar solution could resolve the GI controversy in the TTIP. My position in this Article is that, far from being just an “EU thing,” an appropriate level of GI protection can promote local businesses, high(er) quality products, and more accurate consumer information about products everywhere, including in the U. S. Notably, a rigorous system of GI protection—-one that is based on products grown and manufactured locally and where geographical names are protected against misuse from parties operating outside the geographical areas—-would provide more accurate product information to U. S. consumers and could motivate U. S. producers to invest in and maintain high(er) quality local products. In turn, this could lead to more innovation in the U.

We first {{assess the impact of}} current pension programs on annual income distribution among the elderly, and then estimate the potential impact of post- 2004 Reform pension programs on lifetime income distribution. We show that social security substantially reduces inequality among the elderly on an annual income basis, but that it is mostly due to an income transfer from the young rather than redistribution within the elderly. We also confirm that the potential distributive impact of post- 2004 Reform pension programs on lifetime income is quite limited, compared to that implied by the analysis on an annual income basis. Moreover, we estimate the distributive impact of alternative pension reforms with a bend-point system or <b>claw-back</b> system, both of which have been applied in other advanced countries.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the program of {{compensation}} reform at financial institutions – despite recent wide-ranging changes – remains incomplete. A considerable body of theoretical and empirical research has been developed which, for the most part, suggests that compensation incentives embedded in compensation contracts at banks encouraged risk-taking behaviour which contributed to the Global Financial Crisis. Extensive reforms to compensation rules at financial institutions have been implemented across the globe, including increased use of deferral, mandatory capping of bonuses {{and the introduction of}} <b>claw-back</b> powers. Relying on observations on the failures of Icelandic and UK banks, and legal and economic analyses of compensation reforms in each jurisdiction, this paper argues that some elements of the Icelandic and UK reform programs ought to be transposed to the EU level. Arguably, these recommendations will help improve the resilience of the European banking system and contribute to greater financial stability...|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{different}} alternatives how {{a common}} unemployment insurance {{system for the}} euro area (EA) could be designed and assess their effectiveness {{to act as an}} insurance device in the presence of asymmetric macroeconomic shocks. Running counterfactual simulations based on micro data for the period 2000 - 13, we highlight and quantify the trade-off between automatic stabilization e¤ects and the degree of cross-country transfers. In the baseline, we focus on a non-contingent scheme covering short-term unemployment and find that it would have absorbed a significant fraction of the un- employment shock in the recent crisis. However, 5 member states of the EA 18 would have been either a permanent net contributor or net recipient. Our results suggest that <b>claw-back</b> mechanisms and contingent benefits could limit the degree of cross-country redistribution, but might reduce desired insurance e¤ects. We also discuss moral haz- ard issues at the level of individuals, the administration and economic policy. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} costs and {{benefits}} of clawback provisions that enable firms to recover incentive compensation from top management if financials are restated. In a simple contracting model, we find that a clawback provision effectively lengthens the hori-zon of incentives and curbs misreporting. However, such a provision can add noise to the underlying performance measure, reducing managerial effort and firm value. Our empirical tests support the model’s predictions regarding which types of firms are likely to voluntarily use clawback provisions. We also document that <b>claw-back</b> provisions are associated with higher reporting quality, greater CEO pay-for-performance sensitivity, and higher CEO compensation. (JEL G 30, G 34, G 38) Following the financial crisis of 2007 – 2008, considerable attention has been focused on the structure of compensation contracts for top man-agement.

40|$|Abstract: We {{argue that}} a {{fundamental}} reason {{for the short term}} perspective of corporate executives is the short term orientation of shareholders themselves and the financial markets that drive the performance benchmarks of CEOs. Although some shareholders are prepared to take a more long-term view they are generally not rewarded for their loyalty to the company. While lengthening stock option vesting periods and introducing <b>claw-back</b> provisions into CEO compensation contracts help induce a more long term orientation of CEOs, we argue that it is also necessary to reinforce this more long-term performance-based compensation with a better alignment between shareholders and CEOs horizons. One way of moving towards such an alignment is to introduce L-Shares (or L-shares). These shares provide an additional reward to shareholders that have held on to their shares for a contractually specified period of time, the loyalty period. The reward would be {{in the form of a}} warrant giving the right to purchase a pre-determined number of new shares at a pre-specified price and granted to loyal investors at the expiration of the loyalty period. This paper discusses how L-shares can be structured and distributed, how they may be valued and how they affect liquidity and control of the corporation...|$|E
40|$|Childcare {{policies}} play {{a crucial}} role in helping parents reconcile care and employment-related tasks. This paper quantifies the net cost of purchasing full-time centre-based childcare in OECD countries taking into account a wide range of influences on household budgets, including fees charged by childcare providers as well as childcare-related tax concessions and cash benefits available to parents. Building on these calculations, family resources are evaluated for different employment situations in order to assess the financial trade-offs between work and staying at home. Results are disaggregated to identify the policy features that present barriers to work for parents whose employment decisions are known to be particularly responsive to financial work incentives: lone parents and second earners with young children requiring care. The results indicate that the cost of purchasing childcare services should be analysed in conjunction with other social and fiscal policies that affect family incomes. While childcare fees can be very high, high prices may not impede employment if tax-benefit systems incorporate well-balanced provisions that help parents pay for these services. Conversely, even highly subsidised childcare markets can leave parents with little financial gain from employment if high tax burdens or benefit <b>claw-back</b> rates give rise to adverse work incentives...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we analyze the {{strategies}} of IPO share allocation in Italy. We examine a sample of 181 IPOs listed on the Italian Exchange from 1997 to 2007, in which shares have been assigned both to the public (with no discrimination among the bidders) and to professional institutional investors (with discretionary policies typical of book building). We focus on the portioning of the shares between the two categories of investors above. In Italy <b>claw-back</b> clauses allow underwriters to ‘shift ’ tranches of shares from one category to the other, ‘adjusting ’ the allocation policy declared in the official prospectus. The IPO literature highlights that underwriters may ‘reward ’ information revealed by professional investors with underpriced shares and leave some money on their table. We posit that underwriters have a further power: they {{have the option to}} subtract shares from the retail investors ’ table {{and put them on the}} other table. We propose a simple model in which we disaggregate the changes in the allocation choices between the two categories of investors, considering the ‘oversubscription ratio’, the ‘IPO scaling ratio ’ and the ‘demand satisfaction ’ ratio.

40|$|This paper compares {{marginal}} {{and average}} tax rates on working and saving under our current federal tax system {{with those that}} would arise under a federal retail sales tax, specifically the FairTax. The FairTax would replace the personal income, corporate income, payroll, and estate and gift taxes with a 23 percent effective retail sales tax plus a progressive rebate. The 23 percent rate generates more revenue than the taxes it replaces, but the rebate's cost necessitates scaling back non-Social Security expenditures to their 2000 share of GDP. The FairTax's effective marginal tax on labor supply is 23 percent. Its effective marginal tax on saving is zero. In contrast, for the stylized working households considered here, current effective marginal labor taxes are higher or much higher than 23 percent. Take our stylized 45 year-old, married couple earning $ 35, 000 per year with two children. Given their federal tax bracket, the <b>claw-back</b> of the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the FICA tax, their marginal tax is 47. 6 percent. The FairTax imposes a zero marginal tax on saving meaning that reducing this year's consumption by a dollar permits one to increase {{the present value of}} future consumption by a dollar. In contrast, the existing federal tax system imposes very high marginal taxes on future consumption.

40|$|This study set out {{to assess}} the {{provisions}} of Kenya s 2010 Constitutional framework in providing safeguards to the limitation of rights and fundamental freedoms vis-à-vis the international legal instruments protecting human rights. Concepts and purpose of limitation of fundamental rights and freedoms and notes that underlie limitation of rights is discussed. Limitation {{must take into account}} the protection of public interest and the rights of individuals. The structures of limitation clause are in general form and limit all set of rights or in specific form which limits specific rights. ICCPR does not have a general limitation clause and instead opts for a right-specific limitation clause. The limitation clause in CESCR allows for rights to be limited along the lines of progressive realization and not of immediate application since the rights are resource based. The African Charter embodies three types of limitations: right specific norm-based limitation; right specific <b>claw-back</b> clauses and the general limitation clause. Kenya s 2010 Constitution uses a single clause in limiting the rights under article 24 and grounded on article 24 (1). The study reveals that in order to limit rights, the state must balance the rights and interests of the individual with that of the state; the limiting measures taken should not outweigh the actual circumstances necessitating the restriction; be non-discriminatory; and not make a country avoid her obligation under international law.

40|$|Sovereignty is {{the reason}} why States seek to apply their jurisdictions. All States like to extend their jurisdictions as far as they can, so some of them have adopted {{extraterritorial}} policies in exercising their jurisdictions. In this manner the United States has approved several extraterritorial Laws in respect of competition law and sanctions, causing some coercion to non-target states. In response to this long-arm jurisdiction by the U. S., some countries, such as the U. K., Canada, Australia, Mexico etc., as well as the E. U., took actions of their own in order to nullify these extraterritorial laws. These measures, which are mostly applied to the jurisdictional field, could be described as jurisdictional countermeasures. They can be divided into prescriptive, adjudicative and executive measures, which include blocking statutes, <b>claw-back</b> statutes, non-recognition, procedural restrictions, non-execution and retaliatory measures. Not all of these measures are prohibited by international law and some {{can be viewed as a}} just retorsion against that State. However, where the application of these measures is prohibited by international law – in cases such as the non-recognition of foreign judgments and other jurisdictional regulations in international treaties like mutual judicial assistance agreements – they are countermeasures. If these actions are in response to an illegal extraterritorial law, they should comply with the conditions for countermeasures as cited in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts 2001 as approved by the International Law Commission...|$|E
40|$|New {{models of}} job {{placement}} have emerged {{over the last}} few years that focus on cre-ating demand among employers for people with disabilities. Partnerships between employers and vocational rehabilitation agencies represent one of these approaches. This study investigated the factors that underpin the establishment, development, and maintenance of such partnerships. Using a qualitative approach, semi-structured inter-views were conducted with employers and vocational rehabilitation agencies currently involved in partnerships. The identified factors underpinning partnerships were similar to those obtained from previous research. However, it was also found that these charac-teristics may differ according to the stage of development of partnerships. Implications of these findings for rehabilitation counselor practice are discussed. he opportunity to work has been a fundamental ~ right in Western societies and has been reflected in government intervention into labor markets since the early 20 th century. This right has included people with disabilities who have suffered considerable and sus-tained disadvantage in obtaining work. Government ac-ceptance of a role in redressing this situation has resulted in the provision of vocational rehabilitation services (Brab-ham, Mandeville, & Koch, 1998; Danek et al., 1996). Over the past 60 years, billions of dollars have been spent on vocational rehabilitation programs. This expenditure has been justified on economic as well as social grounds, with proponents arguing that the vocational rehabilita-tion system has more than paid for itself (Smith, 1986) through reductions in social security payments and <b>claw-back</b> through increased tax receipts. Recently, however, given the large expenditures for vocational rehabilitation services, their effectiveness has been questioned in both the United States and Australi...|$|E
40|$|In October 2009, the Commission of the European Union {{published}} its {{proposal for}} a regulation dealing with the private international law aspects of succession. Towards {{the end of last}} year, the UK Government exercised its right not to opt-in to the Regulation at that stage. This thesis examines the reasons behind the UK’s decision not to opt-in and considers the possible ways in which the UK’s concerns might be addressed {{during the course of the}} on-going negotiations. In doing this, the thesis will discuss the main points of contention in the regulation, which evidence a gulf between the English common law and the civil law of continental Europe, and how this might be overcome. This thesis attempts to illustrate that the current intransigence of some Member States as regards certain aspects of the regulation shows a disregard for the historical evolution of the civilian legal tradition in those countries. By emphasising the historical development of such civilian concepts as forced heirship and domicile, this thesis suggests that there is greater scope for a compromise solution than has been envisaged until now. By a similar token, domestic reform within the UK indicates that there is room for manoeuvre within the common-law approach to succession. Based on this, the thesis argues for more flexible negotiating positions during discussions relating to the Regulation. Overall, the conclusion that the thesis draws is that problems relating to <b>claw-back</b> and the connecting factor(s), in particular, are not insurmountable. It asserts that a greater cognizance of history coupled with an increased awareness of the failings of domestic regimes can lead to compromises which would ultimately promote a more acceptable regulation to which the UK would feel more comfortable opting-in...|$|E
40|$|The $ 7 billion {{needed for}} the Federal Government to fund {{the last two years}} of the Gonski plan can be easily financed. The Government has a {{potential}} revenue pool of at least $ 34 billion a year by reducing several tax concessions to high income earners and by clamping down on rampant tax evasion by high income earners and large Australian and multinational corporations. The only thing stopping this is the unwillingness of the Government to challenge the privileges of the wealthy and big business. The potential revenue gains per year are: High income earners (top 20 %) Superannuation: $ 16. 3 billion Capital gains: $ 4. 7 billion Negative gearing: $ 2 billion Family trusts: Not quantified Overseas tax havens: Not quantified Total: $ 23 billion Corporate tax evasion Large Australian public companies: $ 4. 2 billion (50 % of Tax Justice Network estimate) Overseas companies: $ 2 billion (scaling up of International Centre for Tax and Development estimate) Total: $ 6. 2 billion Other tax concessions Refund of unused dividend franking credits: $ 4. 6 billion Grand total: $ 33. 8 billion Even a partial <b>claw-back</b> of revenue lost through these tax concessions and corporate tax evasion would fund Gonski. The funding needed to finance the average $ 3. 5 billion a year for each of {{the last two years of}} Gonski is only 10 % of the total tax revenue forgone annually. In addition, there are many more tax shelters that provide significant benefits to high income earners and corporations. The Turnbull Government should stop using the Budget deficit as an excuse not to fund the last two years of Gonski. Labor should stop dithering about committing to the plan it devised while in government. The fundamental question is whether the Turnbull Government (and the Labor Opposition) is prepared to make the rich and big business pay their fair share of tax and invest it in reducing disadvantage in education to improve the lives of the low income students, improve workforce skills and participation and increase productivity. If the Prime Minister really believes in the need to develop an innovative, agile, knowledge- based economy it should be a straightforward choice.

40|$|May 26, 2011, {{marked the}} ten-year {{anniversary of the}} {{establishment}} of the African Union, and with the sudden death of Muammar al Gaddafi, who was instrumental {{in the creation of the}} African Union, the time is ripe to fully re-assess the ability of the African Union to ensure state compliance with the Constitutive Act of the African Union (Constitutive Act) and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (African Charter). The African continent has a long history of massive human rights abuses. Prior to 2001, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was responsible for ensuring that African states complied with international law and respected the human rights of their citizens. Given the OAU’s many failures, including its inability to stop or prevent human rights violations, member states of the OAU elected to overhaul the OAU and establish the African Union on May 26, 2001. Previous writings by legal scholars on the African Union have generally concluded that the African Union, like its predecessor the OAU, has been unable to protect human rights in Africa or ensure state compliance with the democratic and human rights principles set forth in the African Charter. This Article contributes to the body of scholarship on the effectiveness of the African Union by analyzing the African Union’s response to the political and humanitarian crises in Madagascar, Guinea-Conakry, Zimbabwe, Libya, and Kenya from both a realist and institutionalist perspective on state compliance with international law. This Article argues that while the African Union’s handling of the crises in Madagascar and Guinea-Conakry indicates that the African Union is successfully providing incentives for its smaller and less powerful member states to comply with the Constitutive Act and the African Charter, the African Union’s ultimate resolution of the crisis in Zimbabwe and its feeble responses to the political turmoil in Libya and Kenya signal that the African Union continues to be plagued by a number of problems, including, but not limited to, the following: limited political will, failure to timely and uniformly impose sanctions, state reporting failures, and inadequately drafted governing instruments. This Article will propose a number of solutions to these problems, such as revising the African Charter to eliminate <b>claw-back</b> clauses, amending the Constitutive Act, revising the protocol establishing the Peace and Security Council to remove the principle of equitable regional representation and rotation, better utilizing the African Union Commission on International Law, and revising the protocols establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights and the African Court of Justice and Human Rights...|$|E
