40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to find a new}} and better approach to estimate forest LAI in fully closed canopy condition. Although there have been many previous studies to estimate LAI using optical remote sensor data, there are not enough evidences whether the red and near-IR reflectance are still effective to estimate forest LAI in closed canopy situation. In this study, we have conducted a simple correlation analysis between LAI and spectral reflectance at two different settings: 1) spectral measurements on the multiple-layers of leaf samples and 2) Landsat ETM+ reflectance with field-measured LAI on the <b>close</b> <b>canopy</b> forest stands. In both cases, the correlation coefficients between LAI and spectral reflectance were higher in short-wave infrared (SWIR) and visible wavelength regions. Although the near-IR reflectance showed positive correlations with LAI, the correlations strength is weaker than in SWIR and visible region. The higher correlations were found with the spectral reflectance data measured on the simulated vegetation samples than with the ETM+ reflectance on the actual forests. In addition, there was no significant correlation between the forest LAI and NDVI, in particular when the LAI values were over three and full canopy situation. The SWIR reflectance may be important factor to improve the potential of optical remote sensor data to estimate forest LAI in <b>close</b> <b>canopy</b> situation...|$|E

This operation was the culmination of investigations over the previous 8 years into the causes of slow growth of spruce plantations (Picea spp.) over appreciable areas of soils derived from Culm Measures, notably at Wilsey Down forest, Cornwall, and Halwill forest, Devon. At these sites, many plantations dating from the early 1930 's are almost com-pletely 'checked', having failed to <b>close</b> <b>canopy</b> in up to 30 years.

40|$|This work {{analyzed}} the litter decomposition rates registered in riparian native and reforested forest fragments, {{to test the}} hypothesis that the decomposition is dependent on the structural and the floristic composition of the vegetation. The work was carried out in the upper São Francisco River Basin from September 2001 to August 2002. The decomposition rate was measured by quantifying the monthly mass loss of 12 litterbags (20 x 20 cm) containing five grams of dry leaf in each one and located randomly in the two fragments analyzed. Mass loss kinetics was faster in the native forest, reaching the T 50 % in 5 months (02 / 2002) while loss in the reforested area was 30 % during the same period. This could be reflecting the successional stage characteristic of each fragment and the local climate since the conditions at the native forest (<b>close</b> <b>canopy,</b> less luminosity, higher humidity and cooler constant temperatures) favor the proliferation of microorganisms. This can also be due to differences in floristic composition since the reforested area presents reduced species diversity, with a dominance of Bauhinia variegata L. In addition, the native riparian forest fragment presented higher levels of organic matter content which could contribute to accelerate the litter decomposition rates in this fragment...|$|E

Accuracy of the classification model was estimated by cross-validation and by calculating the percentage of correctly classified pixels on the resulting maps using an independent sampling.

Predictive accuracy of both models was estimated by calculating NRMSE for the independent validation sample.

40|$|International audienceMapping zonations of {{mangrove}} species (ZMS) {{is important}} when assessing {{the functioning of}} such specific ecosystems. However, the reproducibility of remote sensing methods for discriminating and mapping mangrove habitats is often overstated {{due to the lack}} of temporal observations. Here, we investigated the potential use of temporal series of high-resolution multispectral satellite images to discriminate and map four typical Asian ZMS. This study was based on the analysis of eight images acquired between 2001 and 2014 over the mangrove area of Nusa Lembongan, Bali, Indonesia. Variations between years in the top-of-atmosphere reflectance signatures were examined as functions of the acquisition angles. We also applied maximum likelihood supervised classification to all of the images and determined the variability in the classification errors. We found that the distinction between spectral signatures of ZMS characterized by a <b>close</b> <b>canopy</b> was fairly independent of the season and sensor characteristics. By contrast, the variability in the multispectral signatures of ZMS with open canopies and associated classification errors could be attributed to variability in ground surface scattering. In both cases, sun-viewing geometry could alter the separability between ZMS classes in near-nadir viewing or frontward sun-viewing configurations, thereby explaining why the overall accuracy of ZMS classification might vary from 65 % to 80 %. Thus, multitemporal analysis is an important stage in the development of robust methods for ZMS mapping. It must be supported by physical-based research aiming to quantify the influences of canopy structure, species composition, ground surface properties, and viewing geometry parameters on ZMS multispectral signatures...|$|E

The present study was carried out to investigate the importance of habitat quality and habitat heterogeneity for the diversity, distribution and abundance of avifauna in and around Neora Valley National Park (NVNP) during April-May 2010. A total of 73 bird species belonging to 25 families were recorded during the present study applying a modified point count method. Forest edges were found to be most diverse with a total count of 54 bird species having an abundance of 172. 53 number of birds ha- 1.

However there is debate as to whether removal of these invaders is effective at improving water resources. More information is needed about the partitioning of species-specific water use and root water uptake distributions in this spatially complex karst environment. This study aimed to find what site factors are driving differences in brush transpiration on the Edwards Plateau during the spring season. The species-specific transpiration and pre-dawn leaf water potentials of ashe juniper, honey mesquite and the co-dominant live oak trees were monitored over a 10 week period during spring 2009. Three sites were chosen, a <b>close</b> <b>canopy</b> forest site and two open savannas with relatively deeper soils. Repeated measures mixed model statistical analysis found that species differences were larger than site differences, however one species, ashe juniper was more sensitive to site differences.

40|$|To further {{understand}} the importance of row spacing as an agronomic practice, a study was conducted to evaluate how levels of row spacing determines the critical period of weed control (CPWC) in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). The experiment was laid out as a split-plot design with eight periods of weed interference as the main plots and three row spacing (60, 75 90 cm) as the subplots with three replications of each treatment combination. Period of weed interference consisted of weed removal for 14, 35, 54, and 77 days after emergence (DAE), and weed infestation for 14, 35, 54, and 77 DAE. Results indicated that the mean yield of cowpea was higher at narrow spacing (60 cm) than at wide spacing (90 cm) under season-long weed infestation plots but no difference in yield was found among the row spacing in the season-long weed removal plots. There was no difference {{in the beginning of the}} CPWC among the row spacing. However, 90 cm row spacing requires longer period of weed removal to avoid unacceptable yield loss when compared to 60 cm row spacing. The end of the CPWC coincides with the period of canopy closure by the crop. This finding suggests that it took the crop longer time to <b>close</b> <b>canopy</b> at wide row spacing (90 cm) compare to reduced row spacing. The differences in the duration of weed control intervention in crop row spacing suggest the importance of integrating decisions regarding row spacing and period of weed control in weed management strategies...|$|E
