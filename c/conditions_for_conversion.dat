5000|$|While {{salvation}} {{is indeed}} a gift in Oneness belief, it must be received. [...] This reception of salvation is generally what is considered conversion, and is accepted {{in the majority of}} evangelical Churches. The first mandate is true faith in Jesus Christ, demonstrated by obedience to God's commands, and a determination to submit to his will in every aspect of one's life. Oneness adherents reject the notion that one may be saved through what they call [...] "mental faith": mere belief in Christ, without life-changing repentance or obedience. Thus, they emphatically reject the idea that one is saved through praying a Sinner's Prayer, but rather the true saving faith and change of life declared in scripture. Oneness Pentecostals have no issue with the Sinner's Prayer itself, but deny that it alone represents [...] "saving faith"; the Bible, accordingly mandated repentance, baptism by water and spirit with receipt of the Holy Spirit as the manifestation of the spirit part of the rebirth experience, this represents the manifestations of true, godly faith that was obeyed and done by the early Church believers not only in Jerusalem but also those who are in Samaria, in Europe, even in Asia and at one point to an Ethiopian Eunuch. Thus, one who has truly been saved will gladly submit to the biblical <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>conversion.</b> According to these believers, Jesus and the Apostles taught that the New Birth experience includes repentance (the true Sinner's Prayer), and baptism in both water and God's Spirit.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} problem of motion planning for systems with velocity constraints which restrict the system velocities but do not reduce the reachable configuration space. Such constraints are nonholonomic. Traditional motion planning methods assume that a robot can move in any direction. These plans cannot be followed by nonholonomic systems, such as car-like mobile robots which cannot move sideways. The theory of exterior differential (particularly Pfaffian) systems is presented as an analysis method for nonholonomic systems. The Goursat normal form for Pfaffian systems of codimension two is shown to be equivalent to the two-input chained form for nonholonomic control systems.

40|$|Methods for the {{detection}} and quantification of ammonium picrate and picric acid in soil and water were developed. Picrate ions were extracted from water directly or from acetone extracts of soil by solid-phase, acidic, ionexchange materials. Elution from the ion exchangers was accomplished by converting the retained picrate to picric acid using strong aqueous, acid– organic solvent mixtures. The resulting colorless solution was then converted back to a colored picrate solution by dilution with water. Quantification and correction for background interferences were based on spectrophotometric measurements. A colorimetric, chemical confirmation of picrate was possible for the water method. The method detection limits were determined to be 1. 3 μg/g for soil and 3. 6 μg/L for water.

40|$|Due to the {{physicochemical}} {{properties of}} nitrogen oxides as active molecules, {{the removal of}} this group of pollutants has always been considered {{as a matter of}} concern for specialists. The present study seeks to develop the removal technique of nitrogen oxides "as a major type of air pollutant" by means of non-thermal plasma process under atmospheric conditions. Besides having the potential to reduce energy consumption in the pollutant removal process, non-thermal plasma technology also provides particular flexibility for the simultaneous removal and mitigation of the secondary pollutants. In this research we have used the Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma process to achieve an effective conversion of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx). As a result of the collisions between the electrons and the airflow containing NOx, active radicals and molecules are generated in a limited and controlled volume (plasma reactor) and the conversion and removal process is then carried out in the presence of hydrocarbon as reducer gas. The key factors for NOx conversion especially in the non-thermal plasma condition are the geometric structure and design of the reactor, type of discharge, type of power supply, temperature, space velocity, propane/NOx mole ratio, and voltage. In the present study, the factors of temperature, mole ratio of the reducer and input voltage were examined. The results showed that the optimal <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>conversion</b> of NOx into N 2 and O 2 are temperature of 180 °C, propane/NOx mole ratio of 0. 5, and voltage of 5 KV.

For enzymatic conversion of penicillin G into 6 -APA by PGA impregnated bacterial cells, a maximum reaction time of 4 h was found adequate. The procedure for extraction and crystallization of 6 -APA from the enzyme reaction mixture was standardized. Isolation process was carried out under controlled pH conditions and 6 -APA crystals were recovered from the reaction mixture via filtration, concentration and drying. The maximum PGA activity was observed in Escherichia coli strain BDCS-N-FMu 12 (6. 4 mg 6 -APA h - 1 mg - 1 wet cells) whereas Bacillus megaterium (ATCC 14945 used as check) exhibited only 2. 4 mg 6 -APA h - 1 mg - 1 wet cells. The overall yield of 6 -APA crystals obtained after enzymatic conversion of penicillin G ranged between 37 - 55 and 47 - 68 % in foreign and local strains, respectively.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} optically induced switching between {{bright and}} dark charged divacancy defects in 4 H-SiC. Photoluminescence excitation and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal the excitation <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> such charge <b>conversion.</b> <b>For</b> an energy below 1. 3 eV (above 950 nm), the PL is suppressed {{by more than}} two orders of magnitude. The PL is recovered {{in the presence of}} a higher energy repump laser with a time-averaged intensity less than 0. 1...|$|R
40|$|Frequency {{conversion}} process is studied {{in a medium}} of atoms with a Λ configuration of levels, where transition between two lower states is driven by a microwave field. In this system, conversion efficiency can be very high {{by virtue of the}} effect of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Depending on intensity of the microwave field, two regimes of EIT are realized: "dark-state" EIT for the weak field, and Autler-Townes-type EIT for the strong one. We study both cases via analytical and numerical solution and find optimum <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> the <b>conversion.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
