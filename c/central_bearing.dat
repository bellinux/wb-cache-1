6000|$|During {{the last}} night we had been kept awake by the {{drumming}} and fifing, singing and shouting, weeping and howling, pulling at accordions and striking the monotonous Shingungo. Merolla names this cymbal Longa, and describes it justly as two iron bells joined by an arched bar: I found it upon the Tanganyika Lake, and suffered severely from its monotonous horrors. Monteiro and Gamitto (p. 232) give an illustration {{of what is known}} in the Cazembe's country as [...] "Gomati:" [...] The Mchua or gong-gong of Ashanti has a wooden handle connecting the cones. Our palhabote had brought up the chief Mashel's bier, and to-day we have the satisfaction of seeing it landed. A kind of palanquin, covered with crimson cloth and tinsel gold like a Bombay [...] "Tabút," [...] it had three horns or prominences, two capped with empty black bottles, and the <b>central</b> <b>bearing</b> the deceased's helmet; it was a fancy article, which might have fitted him of Gath, with a terrific plume and the spoils of three horses in the sanguine hues of war. Although eight feet long by five broad, the coffin was said to be quite full. The immense respect which the Congoese bear to their rulers, dead as well as alive, prevented my verifying the accounts of the slave dealers. I knew that the chief who had died at Kinsembo, had been dried on a bamboo scaffolding over a slow fire, and lay in state for some weeks in flannel stockings and a bale of baize, but these regions abound in local variations of custom. Some declared, as we find in Proyart, that the corpse had been mummified by the rude process of smoking; others that it had been exposed for some days to the open air, the relatives sitting round to keep off the flies till preliminarily bandaged. According to Barbot (iii. 23), the people of Fetu on the Gold Coast and the men of Benin used to toast the corpse on a wooden gridiron; and the Vei tribe, like the Congoese, still fumigate their dead bodies till they become like dried hams. This rude form of the Egyptian rite is known to East as well as to West Africa: Kimera, late King of Uganda, was placed upon a board covering the mouth of a huge earthern pot heated from below.|$|E

50|$|The {{new engine}} has a Lanchester {{vibration}} damper {{on the front}} end of its crankshaft. Its camshaft and valves are overhead, the valves being set at an angle of 45 degrees {{on either side of the}} spark plug. At the back of the engine there is a vertical shaft to drive the camshaft. The camshaft works the inlet valves through rockers and by horizontal pushrods works the exhaust valves on the opposite side. The whole mechanism is enclosed and the covers are easy to remove. The double springs on the valve stems have variable tension. Though removing the cylinder head is not as simple as on a conventional design its removal does not affect the timing of the engine or its magneto. The crankshaft has three bearings, the camshaft four. The air supply to the carburettor is routed through a tunnel in the crankcase and in this way the air is slightly warmed while cooling the crankshaft's <b>central</b> <b>bearing.</b> The pistons are manganese with tubular connecting rods and the gudgeon pins receive positive oiling.|$|E

40|$|International audienceHow the {{patterns}} of niche occupancy vary from species-poor to species-rich communities is a fundamental question in ecology that has a <b>central</b> <b>bearing</b> on the processes that drive patterns of biodiversity. As species richness increases, habitat filtering should constrain the expansion of total niche volume, while limiting similarity should restrict the degree of niche overlap between species. Here, by explicitly incorporating intraspecific trait variability, we investigate the relationship between functional niche occupancy and species richness at the global scale. 2. We assembled 21 datasets worldwide, spanning tropical to temperate biomes and consisting of 313 plant communities representing different growth forms. We quantified three key niche occupancy components (the total functional volume, the functional overlap between species and the average functional volume per species) for each community, related each component to species richness, and compared each component to the null expectations. 3. As species richness increased, communities were more functionally diverse (an increase in total functional volume), and species overlapped more within the community (an increase in functional overlap) but did not more finely divide the functional space (no decline in average functional volume). Null model analyses provided evidence for habitat filtering (smaller total functional volume than expectation), but not for limiting similarity (larger functional overlap and larger average functional volume than expectation) as a process driving the pattern of functional niche occupancy. 4. Synthesis. Habitat filtering is a widespread process driving the pattern of functional niche occupancy across plant communities and coexisting species {{tend to be more}} functionally similar rather than more functionally specialized. Our results indicate that including intraspecific trait variability will contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the processes driving patterns of functional niche occupanc...|$|E

40|$|The prime {{purpose of}} the work in hand is to present factors/concepts {{important}} in generating a motivating environment in our compulsory school system, with a focus on the classroom, the analysis being based on the goals stated in the national curriculum. Expressed in greater and more explicit detail, {{the purpose of this study}} was initially to a) investigate how pupils and school principals perceive that schools have achieved the goals of the curriculum for the compulsory school system (Swedish Ministry of Education, 1994), and b), with reference to Lpo 94 identify and analyse important concepts in the school environment and then study these in a correlation analysis. The relationships discovered indicate which factors/concepts are important in achieving a positive and motivating school environment in the later years of the compulsory education system. In the current study, various types of studies have been carried out. In order to map out pupils' perceptions concerning to what extent the various goals expressed in Lpo 94 have been achieved, a quantitative research approach was chosen to enable the analysis of perceptions from a large number of pupils. The quantitative approach was thus used to study relevant concepts in Lpo 94 and relationships between concepts. The data based on pupils' perceptions were gathered using questionnaires, in Studies I-III, which were processed using various statistical methods. In order to interpret and understand school principals' perceptions concerning to what extent the various goals expressed in Lpo 94 have been achieved, qualitative analysis methods were used. Data collection has focussed on "soft data" in the form of qualitative interviews in Study I and interpretive analyses in the form of qualitative analysis of the text material. The classroom variables that are particularly significant in influencing outcomes are Teacher relationships, Influence-Effect and Teacher competence. On the basis of the tentative model the variable Responsibility together with the variables Attitudes and Self-confidence are the result variables that this study indicates as significant in enabling good self-confidence in pupils and a positive attitude to learning. In the current study fairly strong causal relationships are proved between the latent variables Attitudes and Self-confidence. The original tentative model can be modified on the basis of this study. The modified tentative model includes the three original result variables Attitudes, Responsibility and Self-confidence. These variables are, on the basis of the current work, <b>central,</b> <b>bearing</b> in mind the goal of creating a motivating school environment...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} double-blind, randomized {{study was}} to evaluate the ad-vantage of the face-bow application with modification of the vertical jaw-relation within {{the frame of the}} secondary clinical remount of complete dentures. Therefore, the oral health related quality of life (OHRQOL) of the patients was determined before and after the intervention. Methodology 31 complete dentures of patients without craniomandibular dysfunction (prosthesis age < 4 weeks) were clinically remounted with the use of intraoral <b>central</b> <b>bearing</b> reg-istration. The patients were divided in two groups, where one group (MW) was trans-ferred into the articulator through arbitrary upper arch model mounting (reference points: Bonwill triangle and Balkwill angle) and the other group (GB) through arbitrary model mounting with the application of a face-bow. A questionnaire in form of the OHIP-G 49, which encompasses 49 questions that are again allocated to the seven di-mensions of the OHRQOL (functional limitations, pain, mental indisposition, physiolog-ical impairment, mental impairment, social impairment, handicap), was used as appro-priate instrument regarding the OHRQOL measurement. Measurements were taken at the point of time T 0 (Baseline), T 1 (3 days after the clinical remount), and T 2 (84 days after the clinical remount). Outcome At the point of time T 0, the total amount value of the OHIP-G 49 for the MW-group was 48. 6 and for the GB-group 45. 5. At the point of time T 1, a significant decrease to 31. 6 was noted for the MW-group, for the GB-group to 43. 2. At the point of time T 2 the amount average in comparison to T 0 was approximately equal for both groups – MW 29. 1 and GB 29. 4. On the dimension level of the OHIP-G 49, a decrease in all dimensions between T 0 and T 1 could be observed for group MW, whereas for group GB a reduction in only 4 of the 7 dimensions could be noted. Between T 1 and T 2 again for MW a reduction in all dimensions could be observed, for GB in 6 of 7 dimensions. On the level of single questions (item level), between T 0 and T 1 significant reductions could be observed at 9 single questions (items) for group MW and 2 items for group GB. Between T 0 and T 2, the MW group had significant reduc-tions in 12 items and the GB group in 3 items. Discussion In comparison with standards for complete dentures patients in the German population, at the point of time T 0 both groups were superior. The clinical remount for complete dentures patients lead to a further improvement in OHRQOL. For group MW, the im-provement of OHRQOL after the intervention occurred in a shorter timeframe than for group GB. Additionally, more dimensions and items were affected. On a long-term ba-sis, comparable results for both groups show. A face-bow application at vertical modification of dimensions within the frame of the secondary clinical remount of complete dentures does not lead to an improvement of OHRQOL with respect to an arbitrary model application...|$|E
