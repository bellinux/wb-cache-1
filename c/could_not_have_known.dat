When interviewed by Mulder and Scully, he reveals details about the crime that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> from the media accounts, which causes Mulder to believe that Bruckman has psychic ability. Mulder insists that Bruckman join them in {{a visit to the}} crime scene at the doll collector's apartment. Thanks to {{seemingly}} psychically gained information from Bruckman, her body is soon found in a nearby lake.|$|E
5|$|Hal Rogers's brother John {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{even though he}} was in state prison serving a sentence for the rape of a woman who had shared his trailer, {{at the time of the}} murders. Police, investigating the woman's rape allegation, found evidence indicating that he had also sexually assaulted Hal's daughter Michelle, although charges involving this assault were later dropped because of her reluctance to testify. The St. Petersburg Times said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was dismissed as a suspect.|$|E
5|$|Stowell's article {{attracted}} intense attention, {{and placed}} Albert Victor {{among the most}} notable Ripper suspects, but his innocence was soon proven. Gull died before Albert Victor, and so <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> about Albert Victor's death. All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of pneumonia, and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression, it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis. The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure. While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute, for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888, he {{would probably have to}} have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873, six years before he visited the West Indies. Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution, when Albert Victor was serving in the British army, making regular public appearances, and visiting friends at country houses. Newspaper reports, Queen Victoria's diary, family letters, and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public, or meeting foreign royalty, or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders.|$|E

25|$|On December 27, 1847, when Young {{organized}} a new First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve only had seven of its twelve members present {{to represent a}} council to decide the Presidency. William Smith, John E. Page, and Lyman Wight had previously denounced the proceedings and were not present. John Taylor and Parley P. Pratt were in the Salt Lake Valley and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> of the proceedings. This left just seven present, a majority of one meaning Young would have to vote for himself {{in order to gain}} a majority quorum vote in favor of his leadership. Young chose two of the other apostles, Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards, as his counselors in the First Presidency. This left only four members of the Quorum of the Twelve present to vote in favor of creation of the new First Presidency: Orson Hyde, Wilford Woodruff, George A. Smith, and Orson Pratt. The Church of Jesus Christ views this action as a violation of church law compromising the authority of Sidney Rigdon without a majority quorum vote. The LDS Church actively opposes this view of the proceedings.|$|E
500|$|Other {{than his}} brief {{mention in the}} Analects, nothing is concretely known of Zuo Qiuming's life or identity, nor of what {{connection}} he might have with the Zuo zhuan.

[...] Even if he is the [...] "Zuo" [...] referenced in the Zuo zhuans title, this attribution is questionable because the Zuo zhuan describes events from the late Spring and Autumn period that the Zuo Qiuming of the Analects <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Of her return, Budig {{said the}} reason she {{decided to take the}} offer was because of timing. She stated that her life is in Los Angeles, and that ABC did a lot to make the {{transition}} easier for her. Viewers reasoned that Singh's treatment by ABC was not Budig's fault, since she had been approached by Frons himself and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> exactly what would transpire in the upcoming weeks. When asked of Singh, Budig praised her work but seemed aware of how the writers had altered Greenlee's character and of the audience's dissatisfaction with the change; in response to this, she hinted that this issue would not be the case with her return. [...] "I think [...] brought in a different perspective on the character," [...] she said. [...] "Obviously, I played this character for six years and I have a different take on Greenlee." ...|$|E

In fact, Hansen never {{actually}} mentioned money when he produced the envelopes, only asking {{whether or not there was}} any correspondence between the AD's office and the Stanley family. By refusing to acknowledge that he had, in fact, sent something to Stanley's family and then backtracking when confronted with evidence that contradicted his statement, Hansen knew Parker was hiding something. Hansen also admitted that Parker could've just lied about the contents of the envelopes and his investigation would've been stopped cold. As Hansen said years after the incident, [...] "That was the defining moment. All (Parker) had to say was, 'I'm glad you asked, I sent him an insurance form,' and we would've had to start all over, because every dot that we connected started from the premise that we know he sent something." ...|$|E

Williamson accuses Levene of robbing the office. Levene quickly folds and admits that he and Dave Moss were the thieves. Levene tries to bribe Williamson, offering half of his future sales. Williamson reveals that the Nyborg sale is worthless, as the couple is elderly, mentally ill and just like talking to salesmen because they're so lonely. Levene asks why Williamson wants him turned in, and why he would give him the lead in the first place. Williamson simply states he doesn't like Levene, for the years of verbal abuse, and the old man's flippant nature. [...] Roma comes back from his interrogation and Williamson goes in the back room to speak with the detective. Alone with a devastated Levene, Roma proposes the two men work together. The door opens and the detective demands to speak with Levene, shoving him into the back room.|$|E
2500|$|The 20th century Reform Rabbi Gunther Plaut {{observed}} that in [...] the people – not Moses, as recorded in [...] and [...] – chose the officials who would share {{the tasks of}} leadership and dispute resolution. Jeffrey Tigay, Professor Emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania, however, reasoned that although Moses selected the appointees as recorded in [...] and , {{he could not have}} acted without recommendations by the people, for the officers would have numbered in the thousands (according to the Talmud, 78,600), and Moses <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that many qualified people, especially as he had not lived among the Israelites before the Exodus. Professor Robert Alter of the University of California, Berkeley, noted several differences between the accounts in [...] and [...] all of which he argued reflected the distinctive aims of Deuteronomy. Jethro conceives the scheme in [...] but is not mentioned in [...] and instead, the plan is entirely Moses's idea, as Deuteronomy is the book of Moses. In [...] Moses entrusts the choice of magistrates to the people, whereas in [...] he implements Jethro's directive by choosing the judges himself. In [...] the qualities to be sought in the judges are moral probity and piety, whereas [...] stresses intellectual discernment.|$|E
2500|$|Skeptics such as Paul Kurtz and Ray Hyman {{say that}} DuBois {{does not have}} psychic powers. Skeptic James Randi says that people such as DuBois give the {{appearance}} of psychic powers through cold reading techniques. For example, DuBois, when doing her first reading of Schwartz, told him that his deceased friend was telling her, [...] "I don't walk alone," [...] which Schwartz understood to be a reference to his friend's confinement to a wheelchair, which DuBois <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> about. Randi says that Schwartz leapt to an unsupportable conclusion, since the notion of [...] "not walking alone" [...] can mean any number of things, and [...] "certainly does not describe being in a wheelchair." [...] Randi also asserts that experiments that allegedly yield positive results of psychic powers, such as the ones done with DuBois, are not conducted using proper scientific controls. In light of Schwartz's assertion that [...] "some" [...] of his experiments with DuBois were performed under such conditions, Randi questions why the rest of them were not, and points to a report demonstrating that a few of Schwartz's experiments were not performed according to standard scientific protocol. Schwartz's point-by-point response to Randi's criticisms was published in 2005.|$|E
