50|$|The two {{classrooms}} in Block A are very intact, retaining {{most of their}} early linings, joinery and hardware. As a consequence they are important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of early school design under RG Suter (1868-1873), and changes to school design under Robert and John Ferguson (1879-1893) to incorporate requests by educationalists for more windows, greater ventilation, and wide verandahs. The differing approaches to school design demonstrated in the early Waterford school building include: the different window layouts in the two rooms; the exposed roof timbers in the 1871 room compared with the <b>ceiling</b> <b>lining</b> in the 1888-1889 room with battened ceiling vent leading to a gable vent (now blocked up); the exposed framing inside the gable {{end of the second}} classroom (now enclosed with fibrous sheeting); and the differences in window pivoting arrangements. The external framing also is laid out differently in the two building parts.|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} of the hall is a large and well lit space with a timber floor and vaulted <b>ceiling</b> <b>lined</b> with timber. The nave has square timber posts on each side supporting the clerestory and is continuously arcaded. There is a modern kitchen in the western end and a stage at the other.|$|R
50|$|Internal framing is {{provided}} by substantial timber columns, bearers and joists, with <b>ceilings</b> <b>lined</b> with galvanised ripple iron {{to the ground and}} first floors. Steel box beams are also used in some areas to increase clear spans. Flooring consists of rough sawn timber boards, some areas of which have been sheeted over, and piers to the basement and sub-floor are masonry. The roof has timber framed trusses with bolted connections, forming a saw-tooth profile, with glass louvred clerestory windows. <b>Ceilings</b> are <b>lined</b> on the rake with beaded tongue and groove boarding, and the roof is sheeted with corrugated iron.|$|R
50|$|Inside {{there are}} three rooms where the {{original}} beaded tongue-in-groove timber wall and <b>ceiling</b> <b>lining</b> is visible: {{at the end of}} the southern projection of the plan and beside this to the north, as well as in the small room formed at the joint of the two wings of the house. The first two rooms are painted, while the third is not. It is reputed to be the lumber room and would have provided access between the western length of verandah and the formal living and dining rooms of the north-facing wing. Where the original lining remains there are simple timber cornices and picture rails, however later lengths of timber beading have replaced the skirting boards. The wall and ceiling linings are largely fibrous cement sheeting in the private and utilitarian rooms, with an area of more recent vertical timber tongue-in-groove boarding to the west-facing laundry and bathroom. The rooms changed during the 1970s renovation are lined with unpainted sheeting held within a framework of flat metal. The floors are lined with carpet, vinyl or tiles. Only on the unenclosed verandahs is the original timber boarding visible. The ceiling on the western verandah is unlined.|$|E

40|$|AbstractExhaust {{efficiency}} in tunnel fires with mechanical means was discussed. Heat exhaust efficiency and smoke exhaust efficiency were defined and studied under two different exhaust modes (longitudinal exhaust and transverse exhaust) respectively. Exhaust efficiency depends on smoke generation rate, exhaust rate, heat loss through walls of tunnel, configuration of extraction installations and so on. Under smoke extraction, smoke exhaust efficiency equals 1 if a quasi-steady vented stage without upstream outflow forms, otherwise smoke exhaust efficiency {{is less than}} 1. Heat exhaust efficiency is always less than 1 since part of the heat released by the fire is lost through the solid boundaries of tunnel by radiative and convective heat transfer between the smoke and <b>ceiling</b> <b>lining.</b> Based on experimental data obtained {{from a series of}} fire tests in a model tunnel, heat exhaust efficiency was estimated and influencing factors were discussed. In tunnel fires with transverse mechanical exhaust system, heat exhaust efficiency varies from 20 % to 50 %. Heat exhaust {{efficiency in}}creases along with the reduction of the number of exhaust inlets turned on while extracting and decreases along with the increase of the area of exhaust inlet. However, quantitative influence of inlet position on exhaust efficiency still need further study and will be reported later...|$|E

40|$|Realizou-se um estudo epidemiol√≥gico de observa√ß√£o de 63 unidades terminadoras de su√≠nos, com o objetivo de identificar os fatores de risco associados √† ocorr√™ncia de artrite no abate. Em cada granja foram acompanhados cerca de 220 su√≠nos por 110 dias e anotadas 42 vari√°veis, uma objetiva (condena√ß√£o por artrite) e 41 explicativas (fatores de risco), desde a chegada dos leit√µes na propriedade at√© o servi√ßo de inspe√ß√£o federal no abate. Foram utilizados m√©todos descritivos e an√°lises multivariadas. Das 63 granjas estudadas 39, 7 %, 33, 3 % e 27, 0 % apresentaram, respectivamente, nenhuma (0, 0 %), baixa (¬£ 0, 7 %) e alta (> 0, 7 %) ocorr√™ncia de carca√ßas condenadas por artrite. Observou-se associa√ß√£o entre a ocorr√™ncia de artrite com baixo ganho de peso di√°rio, baixo rendimento de carne na carca√ßa, convers√£o alimentar ruim e baixo peso de carca√ßa. Os fatores de risco associados √† ocorr√™ncia da artrite foram: granjas com hist√≥rico de condena√ß√µes por artrite, mais de cinco anos sem reforma do piso, lote do sexo macho, aus√™ncia de forro nas instala√ß√µes, limpeza das baias somente uma vez ao dia, condi√ß√µes ruins de transporte para o abate, galp√µes com mais de 250 su√≠nos alojados e mais de 10 fornecedores de leit√µes na forma√ß√£o do lote. An {{epidemiological}} {{observational study}} {{was carried out}} in 63 swine finisher units aiming to identify the risk factors associated to the occurrence of arthritis at slaughter. In each farm, about 220 animals were evaluated for 110 days, and 42 variables, one objective (swine condemned for arthritis) and 41 explicative, were collected from the arrival of the pigs to the farm until submitted to the Federal Inspection at slaughter. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and multivariate methods. Out of the 63 studied farms, 27. 0 %, 33. 3 % and 39. 7 % had high (> 0. 7 %, low ¬£ 0. 7 %) and no occurrence (0. 0 %) of animals condemned for arthritis. There was an association between the occurrence of arthritis and low daily weight gain, low carcass meat yield, poor feed conversion rate and low carcass weight.
