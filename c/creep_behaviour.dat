5000|$|Another {{field of}} {{research}} is the appearance and propagation of tears in the fabric, this issue has been partially investigated [...] and represents a fundamental data in {{the determination of the}} safety factor which should be used for a specific structure. Because tear propagation generally occurs at 25% UTS, the safety factor is generally higher than four. The test is carried out on a sample taken from a dismounted structure or by using conditioned samples of fabric which aim to reproduce the in-situ conditions. The load profile should reproduce the expected overload by pulling the sample until breakage, which should start far from the sample edge and the clamping system. The repetition of the test and different temperatures (generally -20 °C and +70 °C) offers important information about the joint behaviour at extreme conditions, such as heavy snow fall with temperatures below zero or a blast of wind during a hot summer. This type of test is generally required by designers and manufacturers and those in charge of the evaluation of the structure behaviour and the final test of the structure. Finally, in order to prevent collapses due to ponding and fluttering, the <b>creep</b> <b>behaviour</b> should be carefully considered in the design, choosing anchorages which enable periodical re-tensioning according to the predicted fall in the level of pre-stress. It is based on a monoaxial test but an accurate investigation requires the use of virgin cruciform samples of fabric and the force is applied by means of counter weights. The creep is defined as the “increase in strain with time when a constant force is applied” [...] and aims to describe the material behaviour when a constant force is applied {{over a long period of}} time. This has a considerable effect on the design and realisation of the membrane structure because a progressive increase in the material strain leads to a considerable reduction in the level of pre-stress initially induced in the structure. The sample should be maintained at a constant temperature and for specific applications it may require a proper climatic chamber for investigations at high and low temperatures.There are no complete studies about the dynamic behaviour of coated fabric and foils for structural applications. A dynamic test on coated fabrics can evaluate the response under fast loading and unloading cycles due to blasts of wind or other sources of stress. It should consider a conditioned fabric which reproduces the in-situ conditions and the testing apparatus should be able to apply a high speed load profile which is generally not possible with a common testing rig equipped with electric servomotors. The results of this type of test, despite the absence of research which can support these expectations, can highlight anomalies in the fabric strength and in the tear propagation with consequent adjustments in the safety factor applied.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Creep {{performance}} of soldered connections is significant to the reliability evaluation and lifetime prediction of microelectronic and optoelectronic/photonic packaging systems. In this work, <b>creep</b> <b>behaviours</b> of a tin-based composite solder reinforced by nano-sized metal particles and a lead-free Sn-Ag-Bi solder were characterized, with a comparison to Sn 60 Pb 40 solder. The {{results show that}} the nano-composite solder has much better creep resistance than Sn 60 Pb 40. The lead-free Sn-Ag-Bi solder has superior creep performance to both Sn 60 Pb 40 and nano-composite solders. The creep fractography analysis shows that a progressive shear deformation occurred as the main creep fracture mechanism. Sn 60 Pb 40 solder joints deform dominantly by transgranular sliding, while Sn-Ag-Bi and nano-composite solder joints creep by intergranular mechanism through grain boundary sliding and boundary voids growth. The mechanism of enhancing the creep resistance of nano-composite solder joints is that uniformly dispersed nano-sized particulates provide effective resistance by impeding grain boundary sliding and dislocation movement, besides the alloying effect of increasing elasticity modulus of the solder. ...|$|R

The sliding kinetics and global equilibrium are described at a large scale and the evolving shearing strength at the sliding surface derives from the local analysis of the shearing band and its vicinity.

Results are found in terms of dimensionless numbers. Calculation of the slide evolution requires special numerical techniques described in the paper. Band permeability is found to be the dominant property controlling the triggering of fast motions. The creeping stage and the eventual slide blow-up are intimately linked.

40|$|Along {{the central}} {{segment of the}} San Andreas Fault (SAF) near Parkfield, California, dis-placement occurs by a {{combination}} of aseismic creep and micro-earthquake slip. To constrain the strength and parametrize a constitutive relation for the <b>creeping</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the cen-tral segment of the SAF, we conducted friction experiments on clay-rich gouge retrieved by coring the Central Deforming Zone (CDZ) of the SAF at 2. 7 km vertical depth. The gouge was flaked rather than powdered to preserve the natural scaly microfabric, and formed into 2 -mm-thick layers that were sheared using a triaxial deformation apparatus. Experiments were conducted at in situ effective normal stress (100 MPa), pore pressure (25 MPa) and temper-ature (80 – 120 ◦C) conditions using brine pore fluid with the ionic composition of the in situ formation fluid. Velocity-stepping (0. 006 – 0. 6 µm s− 1) and temperature-stepping experiments were conducted on brine-saturated gouge, and slide-hold-slide experiments were conducted on brine-saturated and room-dry gouge. Results are used to quantify the effects of rate, state, temperature and pore fluid on the strength of the CDZ gouge. We find that the gouge is ex-tremely weak (µ < 0. 13) and rate-strengthening, consistent with findings of previous studies on the CDZ gouge. We also find that, in a rate and state friction framework, slip history has...|$|R
