25|$|In general, elite Aksumite {{buildings}} such as palaces {{were constructed}} atop podia built of loose stones {{held together with}} mud-mortar, with carefully cut granite <b>corner</b> <b>blocks</b> which rebated back a few centimeters at regular intervals as the wall got higher, so the walls narrowed as they rose higher. These podia are often all that survive of Aksumite ruins. Above the podia, walls were generally build with alternating layers of loose stone (often whitewashed, like at Yemrehana Krestos Church) and horizontal wooden beams, with smaller round wooden beams set in the stonework often projecting out of the walls (these are called 'monkey heads') on the exterior and sometimes the interior. Both the podia and the walls above exhibited no long straight stretches, but were indented at regular intervals so that any long walls consisted {{of a series of}} recesses and salients. This helped to strengthen the walls. Worked granite was used for architectural features including columns, bases, capitals, doors, windows, paving, water spouts (often shaped like lion heads) and so on, as well as enormous flights of stairs that often flanked the walls of palace pavilions on several sides. Doors and windows were usually framed by stone or wooden cross-members, linked at the corners by square 'monkey heads', though simple lintels were also used. Many of these Aksumite features are seen carved into the famous stelae {{as well as in the}} later rock hewn churches of Tigray and Lalibela.|$|E
500|$|The 1849 {{church is}} a small, one-and-a-half-story, front-gable building. The main façade (northwestern elevation) has two main entrances, {{enclosed}} by white-painted wood, recessed panel doors, and capped by white-painted stone lintels with two stone <b>corner</b> <b>blocks.</b> The church's exterior is brickwork, laid in Flemish bond on the main façade and a five-course American bond on the northeastern, southeastern and southwestern elevations. Two blue-gray stained glass windows (installed in 1905) are symmetrically placed above the main entrances, each capped by stone lintels with two stone <b>corner</b> <b>blocks.</b> The main façade is crowned by a white painted entablature molding with two cornice returns, exemplifying Greek Revival architectural design. In {{the top of the}} gable, a square date stone engraved [...] "1849" [...] is embedded in the brickwork above a gooseneck light fixture. Although the church is now topped by a metal standing-seam roof, it was originally sheathed by wooden shakes.|$|E

500|$|On the church's northeastern {{elevation}} {{there are}} three large, symmetrical stained-glass windows, each with a fixed upper sash and a lower hopper sash. Like the main façade's doorways and windows, the sills, lintels and lintel <b>corner</b> <b>blocks</b> of the stained-glass windows are white-painted stone. Below the windows is an exposed coursed-stone foundation with five tie-rod masonry anchor plates. A small brick chimney is present on this elevation. The church's southwestern elevation also has a coursed-stone foundation, with five tie-rod anchor plates, banked into the ground below three symmetrical stained-glass windows with fixed upper sashes and lower hopper sashes and encased with white-painted stone sills, lintels and lintel <b>corner</b> <b>blocks.</b> On this elevation are a small brick chimney in the roof slope and metal snowbirds along the roof line. Downspouts are located at the southern corners of the northeastern and southwestern elevations. The church's southeastern (rear) elevation has an exposed coursed-stone foundation [...] high, due to its location on sloping ground. At {{the center of this}} elevation is a protruding, gabled brick extension for the interior altar, with symmetrical stained-glass windows on both sides. The gabled protrusion is capped by aluminum flashing. An 1895 wrought-iron fence encloses the property's northwestern perimeter, and a paved brick walkway provides pedestrian access from the driveway to the two main entrances.|$|E
500|$|The {{main body}} of the tower is divided into the two-storey plinth, whose {{exterior}} is made of alpine limestone, and the three-storey tower shaft sheathed in sandstone. The shaft's seemingly massive <b>corner</b> <b>blocks</b> are decorative fixtures held in place by visible iron hooks. Below the roof, the cornice spans around the still-visible bases of the former corner towerlets. The two-story attic is covered by [...] the sweeping, red-tiled, late Gothic spire, in which two spire lights are set to the West and East. They are crowned by ornamental urns with pinecone knobs reconstructed in 1983 from 18th-century drawings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract––In this paper, a <b>corner</b> <b>block</b> list — a new {{efficient}} topological representation for non-slicing floorplan {{is proposed}} with applications to VLSI floorplan and building block placement. Given a <b>corner</b> <b>block</b> list, {{it takes only}} linear time to construct the floorplan. Unlike the O-tree structure, which determines the exact floorplan based on given <b>block</b> sizes, <b>corner</b> <b>block</b> list defines the floorplan independent of the block sizes. Thus, the structure is better suited for floorplan optimization with various size configurations of each block. Based on this new structure and the simulated annealing technique, an efficient floorplan algorithm is given. Soft blocks and the aspect ratio of the chip {{are taken into account}} in the simulated annealing process. The experimental results demonstrate the algorithm is quite promising. 1...|$|R
2500|$|An {{exception}} to the typical, uniform grid is the plan of Savannah, Georgia (1733), known as the Oglethorpe Plan. It is a composite, cellular city block consisting of four large <b>corner</b> <b>blocks,</b> four small blocks in between and a public square in the centre; the entire composition of approximately ten acres (four hectares) {{is known as a}} ward. Its cellular structure includes all the primary land uses of a neighborhood and has for that reason been called fractal. [...] Its street configuration presages modern traffic calming techniques applied to uniform grids where certain selected streets become discontinuous or narrow, thus discouraging through traffic. The configuration also represents an example of functional shared space, where pedestrian and vehicular traffic can safely and comfortably coexist.|$|E

This article proposes a compact algorithm for placement based on <b>corner</b> <b>block</b> list. By introducing the dummy blocks in CBL, our algorithm can intellectively employ dummy blocks in the packing to represent the placement including empty rooms, which <b>corner</b> <b>block</b> list cannot represent. Our algorithm can obtain the fast convergence to an optimal solution. Based on the compact approach, we propose {{a new way to}} handle arbitrary shaped rectilinear modules.

40|$|We {{propose to}} use a <b>corner</b> <b>block</b> list (CBL) {{representation}} for mosaic floorplans. In a mosaic floorplan, each room has only one block assigned to it. Thus, there is a unique corner room on the to p {{right corner of the}} chip. <b>Corner</b> <b>block</b> deletion and <b>corner</b> <b>block</b> insertion keep the floorplan mosaic. Through a recursive deletion process, a mosaic floorplan can be converted to a representation that is named as CBL. Given a CBL, it takes only linear time to construct the floorplan. The CBL is used for the application to very large-scale integration floorplan and building block placement. We adopt a simulated annealing process for the optimization. Soft blocks and the aspect ratio of the chip are taken into account in the optimization process. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm is quite promising...|$|R
