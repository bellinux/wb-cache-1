5|$|On 23 February 2004, the U.S. Army {{announced}} that {{they had decided to}} terminate all work on the Comanche program. At the time, it was stated that the Army had determined that a number of upgrades would be necessary in order for the RAH-66 to be capable of surviving on the battlefield in the face of current anti-aircraft threats; however, the Army had instead decided to re-direct the bulk of its funding for rotary development toward the renovation of its existing helicopter fleet of attack, utility, and reconnaissance aircraft. Specifically, the Army also had plans to reuse the funds allocated to the Comanche program to speed up development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which could also perform the scouting role intended for the vehicle. At the time of its termination, the Comanche program had reportedly spent US$6.9billion. The <b>contract</b> <b>termination</b> fees involved were estimated to total US$450–680million for the main program partners Sikorsky and Boeing.|$|E

In the Feast or Fired match, four {{briefcases}} are held above four different turnbuckles on poles, with three having future title shots for the TNA World Heavyweight, TNA X Division, and TNA World Tag Team Championships; the remaining briefcase holds a pink slip, leading to that wrestler's <b>contract</b> <b>termination.</b> A wrestler must retrieve the briefcase {{and then leave}} the ring {{in order to gain}} official possession of the case.

30|$|In {{the second}} step of our analysis, we {{investigate}} the behavior of active users of the provider’s Facebook brand page and non-users over time. Specifically, we analyze social media interactions {{with respect to their}} effect on the churn propensity and the resulting customer lifetime. For this purpose, we compute the Kaplan–Meier estimates for active, passive and total <b>contract</b> <b>terminations</b> to measure the customer survival over time for both groups. Analogous to the full sample in Study 2, we use the propensity score matching approach to reduce the selection bias with respect to the social media interactions prior to <b>contract</b> <b>terminations.</b> 4 The results in “Appendices 1 and 2 ” indicate that the matched sample has had its biases reduced (on average, 92.9  % for all variables).|$|R

25|$|After World War I, Harold Oliver, {{arguably the}} state's best player, {{was close to}} {{retiring}} from league football playing only 1 game in 1919 and 8 in 1920. However keen supporters of the club hoping to replicate its pre-war success raised funds and bought him a motorbike so he could commute from his farm in Berri for the 1921 season. Oliver would captain the club to the 1921 premiership, winning his fourth in the process. In 1922 after playing only 5 league matches for the season his football career {{came to an end}} due to commitments regarding his farm and disputes regarding game compensation. His <b>contract</b> <b>termination</b> meant he was paid ₤76 of ₤100 pounds for the season making him one of the highest-paid footballers of the era. At the end of the 1922 SAFA season, Port Adelaide travelled to Sydney and played a combined New South Wales side on the Sydney Cricket Ground winning the match. In following seasons most of Port Adelaide's champion players from before the war started to retire and the club's performances declined.

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} social media interactions and customer churn, in the first step, we employ a probit model with sample selection (Van de Ven et al. 1981). For this purpose, we use the full sample of 334, 111 customers and apply a Heckman correction {{to account for the}} self-selection of Facebook as a communication channel. We employ the same set of explanatory variables as in Study 1, include the upselling behavior and use the sign-up date to account for differences in customer tenure. For the sample selection component, we use the same explanatory variables as in the propensity score matching (i.e., age, gender, usage, and purchasing power). To reduce complexity, we chose all <b>contract</b> <b>terminations</b> as the dependent variable (i.e., both active and passive terminations).|$|R
