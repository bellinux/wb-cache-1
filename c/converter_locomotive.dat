40|$|Abstract:- The paper {{analyses}} and experimentally verifies two different modulation strategies {{based on a}} Space Vector Modulation (SVM) technique, specifically designed for three-phase Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) inverters. Proposed technique was designed to maintain, also in NPC inverters, all the advantages of SVM used in traditional two-level inverters. The employment of two different modulation strategies, when different operating conditions occurs, allows {{the improvement of the}} harmonic content of the output currents produced by NPC inverters. After {{a detailed description of the}} Space Vector Modulation technique, the two modulation strategies are compared by the means of some significant experimental results.

5000|$|This {{category}} {{does not}} cover railways with a single-phase (or DC) supply which is converted to three-phase on the locomotive or power car, e.g. most railway equipment from the 1990s and earlier using solid-state converters. The Kando system of the 1930s developed by Kálmán Kandó and used in Hungary and Italy used rotating <b>converters</b> on the <b>locomotive</b> to convert the single-phase supply to three phases, as did the Phase-splitting system on the Norfolk and Western Railroad in the USA.|$|R

2500|$|In March 1998, Adtranz {{announced}} its intent to consolidate its product range into seven modular product platforms. [...] The electric locomotive platform with {{the brand name}} [...] "Octeon" [...] was {{to be based on}} Adtranz's newest types for Germany (the Class 145 and Class 101). [...] Adtranz originally intended to introduce Octeon types alongside existing products, and applied the name to its new products outside Germany {{at the end of the}} nineties, like the FS Class E464 or the heavy-haul locomotive Iore. [...] The GTO thyristor based <b>converters</b> of these <b>locomotives</b> were from the water-cooled Camilla family, which was developed by ABB as successor for the oil-cooled converters in the SBB-CFF-FFS Re 460. [...] The Octeon brand name did not catch on and was abandoned when Bombardier acquired Adtranz in 2001.|$|R
40|$|The growing {{complexity}} of the AC and DC traction systems {{in terms of both}} new technologies and automation requires a careful control of the Power Quality disturbances. Among the disturbances, the waveform distortions are of special concern because of the widespread use of power static <b>converters</b> for both <b>locomotive</b> drives and auxiliary services. Unfortunately, the spectral components of these converters can be highly time-varying both in amplitude and frequency with consequent difficulties in detecting the waveform components and defining proper distortion indices. In this paper the Prony method was tested for this purpose and a novel approach for the analysis of traction non-stationary signals, based on the “subspace” methods, is proposed: the “rootMusic” harmonic retrieval method which is an example of highresolution eigen structure-based methods. Both methods can allow an accurate and useful estimation of amplitude and frequency of spectral components with their changes in time...|$|R
40|$|In the {{technology}} sector of power electronics and control, the multilevel converter technology {{is still a}} rather new research area, but the application possibilities {{in the field of}} power drives and energy will demand more solutions with this promising technology. In the future, more converter systems will be realized with the multilevel topology. Up to now, multilevel converters have only been used in very particular applications, mainly due to the high costs and complexity of the multilevel converter system. The high costs are {{due to the fact that}} the latest technology on semiconductors, magnetic material for inductor and transformer cores and control system technology had to be used. But nowadays new developments in the fields of power semiconductors such as the IGBT, IGCT and perhaps in the future SiC switches as well as improvements of the performance of magnetic cores used in medium frequency transformers will favor the multilevel converters for many other application fields. It can be noted that the industrial trend is moving away from heavy and bulky passive components towards power converter systems using more and more semiconductor elements controlled by powerful processor systems integrating intelligent multi-task control algorithms. The presented work is a contribution to the large field of multilevel converters. It shows a certain kind of multilevel converter in a single phase and a three-phase configuration, called the series-connected four-quadrant converters (SCFQ). The two specialties of the presented converter type are a) that all the multilevel converter steps are fed by an identical DC voltage and b) that every multilevel converter step is realized with an individual AC-DC converter or four-quadrant converter. This type of multilevel converter is called multilevel converter with symmetrical feeding. In this work, a general theoretical development has been done for the use of this multilevel converter type. A special type of DC-DC converter is presented, in order to feed the individual four-quadrant converters of the multilevel converter with a constant DC voltage. All the developments and methods used are based on mathematical expressions. Various simulations using the latest software simulation tools are accomplished and are used to study different cases. The feasibility of the developments is underlined with a series of experimental results with all types of the used converters, which have been realized in the framework of this thesis. The main application for the multilevel converter presented in this work is the frontend power <b>converter</b> in <b>locomotives.</b> Instead of using a heavy low-frequency transformer to reduce the high-voltage from the catenary to a supportable voltage for the semiconductors, a multilevel converter concept is used. The multilevel converter is directly coupled to the catenary. There are many advantages compared to the existing solutions. In the same context, a novel solution of a multilevel converter has been developed for a locomotive usable on different power lines. The converter allows not only the operation on the high AC voltage power line (15 kV), but also can be coupled to a medium-voltage DC power line (3 kV). Three different configuration types of the <b>locomotive</b> <b>converter</b> have been developed and tested in a complex simulation environment. Besides the locomotive application, there are many more interesting applications for the symmetrical multilevel converter, e. g. in the fields of energy transmission (FACTS, static VAR compensators, electronic high-voltage transformers, etc.) and industrial drives. But certainly in the future with the availability of cheap semiconductors adapted to the needs of the multilevel converter, even more applications in lower power fields will be realized...|$|R
50|$|In October 2006, GNER put 89001 up {{for sale}} with a six-week {{deadline}} for bids. The AC Locomotive Group launched an appeal and fundraising effort to save the locomotive which was ultimately successful, purchasing the locomotive in December 2006. The locomotive is mostly complete although {{a number of major}} components require expensive overhaul before the loco could run on the main line again. A thorough survey has been undertaken to establish exactly what is required, and costs drawn up. Cosmetic work in 2007 saw the loco return to its original InterCity Executive colour scheme. Electrical restoration work has focussed on repairing and/or refurbishing the items that led to the locomotive being withdrawn from service, namely the traction motors and their associated field <b>converter</b> electronics. The <b>locomotive</b> was lifted by Harry Needle Railroad Company at Barrow Hill Engine Shed in December 2010, and three traction motors were removed including the one known to be faulty. These are currently (February 2011) being examined at Bowers to allow repair cost estimates to be made. Two of the field converters have been removed, one is faulty and again repair estimates are being sought. Initially it is intended, as funds become available, to allow one power group (i.e. one bogie) to become fully operational.|$|R

Under the management and {{on the base of}} plans of Kálmán Kandó, three phase electric traction (two upper wires + rails) of feed 3 kV and 15 Hz - produced by a different power station - was realised for thirty years from 1902.
