5|$|The Mendips are {{the most}} southerly Carboniferous {{limestone}} uplands in Britain. They are composed of three major anticlinal structures, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The limestone is quarried for building stone and the other rocks for use in road construction and as a <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregate.</b> Sand, gravel and peat are extracted {{in other parts of}} the county.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Variscan mountain-building, the Mendip area now {{comprises}} at least four anticlinal fold structures, with an east-west trend, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The latter are quarried for use in road construction and as a <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregate.</b> The Mendips were considerably higher and steeper 200 to 300million years ago, and subsequent erosion has resulted in a range of surface features including gorges, dry valleys, screes, swallets and others typical of karst landscapes. These are complemented underground by a large number of caves both beneath the plateau and {{at the base of the}} southern escarpment. Wookey Hole is one example of the caves of the area. There are also areas of limestone pavement and other karst features. Dissolution of the limestone produced many of the gorges including Cheddar Gorge and Burrington Combe. Springs are a common feature of the eastern part of the hills, a number of which have associated tufa deposits.|$|E
25|$|Dolomite {{is used as}} an {{ornamental}} stone, a <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregate,</b> and {{a source}} of magnesium oxide, {{as well as in the}} Pidgeon process for the production of magnesium. It is an important petroleum reservoir rock, and serves as the host rock for large strata-bound Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) ore deposits of base metals such as lead, zinc, and copper. Where calcite limestone is uncommon or too costly, dolomite is sometimes used in its place as a flux for the smelting of iron and steel. Large quantities of processed dolomite are used in the production of float glass.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{recently}} {{conducted at the}} Hong Kong Polytechnic University to investigate {{the possibility of using}} recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates</b> and crushed clay brick as aggregates in unbound subbase materials. The results showed that the use of 100 % recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates</b> increased the optimum moisture content and decreased the maximum dry density of the subbase materials compared to those of natural subbase materials. Moreover, the replacement of recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates</b> by crushed clay brick further increased the optimum moisture content and decreased the maximum dry density. This was mainly attributed to the lower particle density and higher water absorption of crushed clay brick compared to those of recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates.</b> The CBR values (unsoaked and soaked) of the subbase materials prepared with 100 % recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates</b> were lower than those of natural subbase materials. The CBR values further decreased as the replacement level of recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates</b> by crushed clay brick increased. Nevertheless, the soaked CBR values for all recycled subbases were greater than 30 %, which is a minimum strength requirement in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the recorded percentage swells for all subbases were less than 0. 13 % which can be considered negligible. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

2500|$|The Energy Information Administration (EIA) {{states on}} its website that [...] "a paper mill uses 40 percent less energy to make paper from {{recycled}} paper {{than it does to}} make paper from fresh lumber." [...] Some critics argue that it takes more energy to produce recycled products than it does to dispose of them in traditional landfill methods, since the curbside collection of recyclables often requires a second waste truck. However, recycling proponents point out that a second timber or logging truck is eliminated when paper is collected for recycling, so the net energy consumption is the same. An Emergy life-cycle analysis on recycling revealed that fly ash, aluminum, recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregate,</b> recycled plastic, and steel yield higher efficiency ratios, whereas the recycling of lumber generates the lowest recycle benefit ratio. Hence, the specific nature of the recycling process, the methods used to analyse the process, and the products involved affect the energy savings budgets.|$|E

For each concrete family mixes with 0 %, 10 %, 30 %, 50 % and 100 % replacement ratios of fine natural aggregates (FNA) by fine recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates</b> (FRA) were analysed.

The cement content was kept 350 kg for those mixtures that don't have any 3 m Nano-Silica. To improve the compressive strength of samples, Nano-Silica replaced with 10 % of cement weight in concrete mixtures. By doing the tests, the results showed that, adding Nano-silica to the samples with less percentage of fine recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates,</b> lead to more increase on the compressive strength...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of fine recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates</b> as replacement for sand in mortar and the use as cement replacement and filler is investigated. Mortar with fine recycled aggregates is examined on its mechanical and physical properties. The samples are also examined on a microscopic scale. The fine recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates</b> are made with one-year old concrete made in the laboratory. Fine recycled aggregates (FRCA) are added as a cement replacement (0 %, 10 % and 20 %), as a sand replacement replacing different fractions of natural sand, and as a filler (5 %, 10 % and 25 %). For the cement replacement and filler, the fines are made as fine as possible: (< 0, 32 and < 0, 16 mm). Fine recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates</b> used as a cement replacement have a negative influence on all properties. For the use as a sand replacement, the mixtures show an increase in strength, but {{a significant decrease in}} workability. The use as a filler is proven feasible for mix proportion using up to 10 % of fine recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates.</b> This has a positive influence on the properties of mortar. status: publishe...|$|R

A pilot-scale permeable reactive barrier (PRB), using recycled <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates</b> as reactive material, was installed in low-lying acid sulphate soil terrain for acidic groundwater remediation. Column experiments were previously undertaken with synthetic groundwater to ascertain the dominant reactions occurring within the PRB. Results showed that armouring of the reactive material surface by precipitated Al- and Fe-bearing minerals significantly reduced its acid neutralisation capacity (ANC). The purpose of this current study was to validate this decline in ANC through characterisation of the virgin and armoured <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates,</b> and precipitates that formed on the concrete. Samples of <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates</b> and precipitates were analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy-Energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT). The conclusions drawn from these analyses are that Al-bearing (gibbsite 14. 3 %, boehmite 10. 9 %) and Fe-bearing (goethite 38. 2 %) mineral precipitates of diverse morphology form as a thin layer coating the aggregate surfaces. A reduction of CaO in the armoured <b>concrete</b> <b>aggregates</b> by 47 % correlates with the reduction in ANC of the virgin concrete by 50 % due to armouring...|$|R
