40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is give some field notes on {{exploring}} {{the idea that a}} generalized Tate construction tk reduces chromatic level in stable homotopy theory. The first parts introduce the construction and discuss <b>chromatic</b> <b>reduction.</b> The next section makes a computation and gives the duals of L(n) = L(n) 1. The last part looks ahead, mentioning how this computation could be extended to finding the duals of Steinberg summands in corresponding Thom spectra of negative representations, L(n) -q, and presents an equivariant loopspace machine. Finally, observations made are pulled together and brought back to compute the base case of the generalized Tate construction, evaluated on a sphere. Results parallel work of A. Cathcart, B.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} the chromatic polynomial χ(G, λ) of an unlabeled graph G. It is shown that χ(G, λ) = (1 |A(g) |) Σπ ∈ A(g) χ(g, π, λ), where g is any labeled version of G, A(g) is the automorphism group of g and χ(g, π, λ) is the chromatic polynomial for colorings of g fixed by π. The above expression shows that χ(G, λ) is a rational polynomial of degree n = |V(G) | with leading coefficient 1 |A(g) |. Though χ(G, λ) does not satisfy <b>chromatic</b> <b>reduction,</b> each polynomial χ(g, π, λ) does, thus yielding a simple method for computing χ(G, λ). We {{also show that}} the number N(G) of acyclic orientations of G {{is related to the}} argument λ = − 1 by the formula N(G) = (1 |A(g) |) Σπ ∈ A(g) (− 1) s(π) χ(g, π, − 1), where s(π) is the number of cycles of π.

Vol. 622, pp. 28 – 43, Springer-Verlag, New York/Berlin, 1977) cycle index sum equations for counting unlabeled acyclic digraphs...|$|E
40|$|An {{elementary}} <b>chromatic</b> <b>reduction</b> for gain graphs {{and special}} hyperplane arrangements. (English summary) Electron. J. Combin. 16 (2009), no. 1, Research Paper 121, 31 pp. Summary: “A gain graph is a graph whose edges are labelled invertibly by gains from a group. Switching is {{a transformation of}} gain graphs that generalizes conjugation in a group. A weak chromatic function of gain graphs with gains in a fixed group satisfies three laws: deletioncontraction for links with neutral gain, invariance under switching, and nullity on graphs with a neutral loop. The laws are analogous {{to those of the}} chromatic polynomial of an ordinary graph, though they are different from those usually assumed of gain graphs or matroids. The three laws lead to the weak chromatic group of gain graphs, which is the universal domain for weak chromatic functions. We find expressions, valid in that group, for a gain graph in terms of minors without neutral-gain edges, or with added complete neutral-gain subgraphs, that generalize the expression of an ordinary chromatic polynomial in terms of monomials or falling factorials. These expressions imply relations for all switching-invariant functions of gain graphs, such as chromatic polynomials, that satisfy the deletion-contraction identity for neutral links and are zero on graph...|$|E
30|$|Chroma noise {{reduction}} has application in astrophotography too. PixInsight [17] is an advanced image processing platform {{produced by the}} Spanish company Pleiades Astrophoto. It is a modular application for chroma {{noise reduction}} based on two principal algorithms: the SGBNR (Selective Gaussian Blur Noise Reduction) and the SCNR (Subtractive <b>Chromatic</b> Noise <b>Reduction).</b> The first one is an efficient method to reduce the noise in the medium and large-dimensional scales, while the second one is a technique developed to remove noise in the green channel of coloured deep-sky astrophotos.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for evaluating the}} bidimension of a finite binary relation, i. e., the number of biorders (Guttman relations) needed to yield the relation as their intersection. In case the relation is induced by a binary data matrix, the bidimension equals the minimal number of dimensions needed for {{a representation of the}} data matrix according to the conjunctive model of C. H. Coombs and R. C. Kao (Nonmetric factor analysis, Engineering Research Bulletin No. 38, Univ. of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 1955). Central to the evaluation of the bidimension is its characterization, provided by J. -P. Doignon, A. Ducamp, and J. -C. Falmagne (Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 28, 73 – 109, 1984), as the chromatic number of some associated hypergraph. A procedure is described to reduce hypergraphs of this kind to subhypergraphs with the same <b>chromatic</b> number. This <b>reduction</b> can be used throughout in applying a recurrence relation that expresses the chromatic number of a hypergraph in terms of the chromatic numbers of some of its subhypergraphs...|$|R
40|$|For {{some years}} we have been making studies with Cladocera on the {{occurrence}} of mutations and their inheritance in parthenogenesis. Four mutant characters have been studied in Daphnia longispina. The inheritance is complete, since every parthenogenetic young from a mutant individual genetically possesses the mutant character (except, of course, for the occasional interference of another mutation). This is in accord with expectation, {{in view of the}} absence of <b>chromatic</b> <b>reduction</b> and segregation in the maturation of the parthenogenetic (diploid) eggs in Cladocera. It was of further interest to obtain, if possible, sexual reproduction and hybrid offspring between mutant clones and the “wild” type. Sexual eggs (haploid and requiring fertilization) are frequently obtainable, and males may usually be obtained when desired, but {{it is not easy to}} obtain, simultaneously, ovarian sexual eggs and functional males from just the stocks desired. When sexual eggs and active males are obtained at the same time, fertilization frequently does not occur, and the fertilized eggs when obtained give exceedingly poor hatches, so that many fruitless attempts preceded the obtaining of the desired hybrids. Forty hybrids have been or are now being studied and some data obtained on the inheritance of the two mutant characters involved in the stock used in the crosses. The characters involved are sex-intergradedness and “excavated” head. Twenty-nine of these hybrids are from wild type × mutant, and 11 are from the reciprocal cross. Nineteen of these hybrids genetically possess the mutant character, excavated head, and 19 show sex intergradedness. It seems probable, therefore, that each of these characters is a dominant mendelian character and is heterozygous in the mutant clones used in the crosses. Further breeding and study will be necessary before the full extent of the inheritance of these characters is determined...|$|E
