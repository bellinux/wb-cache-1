This two-dimensional (temperature and luminosity) classification scheme is based on spectral lines sensitive to stellar temperature and surface gravity, which is related to luminosity (whilst the Harvard classification is based on just surface temperature). Later, in 1953, after some revisions of list of standard stars and <b>classification</b> <b>criteria,</b> the scheme was named the Morgan–Keenan classification, or MK (by William Wilson Morgan and Philip C.
