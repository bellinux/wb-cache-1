5000|$|Phenylpiracetam (INN: fonturacetam, {{brand names}} Phenotropil Фенотропил, <b>Carphedon),</b> is a phenylated analog {{of the drug}} piracetam. It was {{developed}} in 1983 to produce a medication for Soviet Cosmonauts to treat the prolonged stresses of working in space. Phenylpiracetam was created at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Biomedical Problems in an effort lead by psychopharmacologist Valentina Ivanovna Akhapkina (Валентина Ивановна Ахапкина). [...] In Russia it is now available as a prescription drug. Research on animals has indicated that phenylpiracetam may have anti-amnesic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and memory enhancement effects.|$|E
5000|$|At the 2006 Winter Olympics she won {{the silver}} in the women's 15 km {{individual}} race, but on February 16, 2006, she was disqualified from further competition for failing a drug test when she {{tested positive for the}} stimulant <b>carphedon.</b> The International Olympic Committee panel found her guilty, and she was expelled from the games and stripped of her medal. She was then banned for two years from competition, and the authorities in Turin started a criminal investigation into the matter [...] The head of the Russian Anti-Doping Committee said that Pyleva took an over-the-counter medication for an ankle injury prescribed by her personal doctor who is not a team doctor, which contained <b>carphedon.</b> It was the only time when Pyleva was injured and took any healing medication while training for a major competition. According to its label, the medication is not forbidden and is officially recommended by its manufacturer for treating sporting related injuries. But the Russian manufacturer did not include the complete compound list for the medication, which is what allegedly led to this catastrophic mistake [...] The manufacturer has been officially warned by the Russian government, while the doctor in question has been banned for two years as well, and has said that she in turn is planning to sue the drug manufacturer [...] Several days after the incident, the IBU president Anders Besseberg {{said in an interview that}} [...] "Pyleva may and must defend her good name in law proceeding against the plant", but ruled out any reduction of the two year disqualification from competition [...]|$|E
40|$|Performed {{has been}} the {{evaluation}} and revealed {{has been the}} absence of the mutagenous and recombinogenous properties of the number of the new GAMK-derivatives medicinal preparations such as GAMK, phenibut, gammalgine, <b>carphedon,</b> hammoxine and omega in the experiments by the count of the somatic mosaicism of the Drosophila and chromosome aberrations in the cells of the mammal's marrow. The antimutagenous properties of the GAMK-derivatives have been detected. The gammoxin and omega are capable of reducing the mutagenous and the recombinogenous influence of ethylenimine and ionizing radiation. The specifity of the antimutagenous and antirecombinogenous action of the GAMK-derivatives in relation to the inductors of the mutagenesis has been revealed. The importance of the methods of introduction of the GAMK-derivatives for their protective properties illustration has been shown.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the prevalence of illicit drugs use among young adults, in particular elite athletes. This study considers the data obtained from anti-doping analyses performed on nearly 100, 000 urine samples from 2000 to 2009 by the World Anti-Doping Agency accredited Italian Anti-Doping Laboratory. The percentage of adverse analytical findings varies on a yearly basis, but it is in the range 1. 0 - 1. 8 % (not considering atypical findings, such as an altered endogenous steroid profile). Among positive results, there is a high prevalence of stimulants and drugs of abuse. The drug of abuse found most frequently is the tetrahydrocannabinol (cannabis) metabolite, accounting for 0. 2 - 0. 4 % of the total samples analysed (18 % of the positive results). The second most frequently encountered drug is cocaine, as detected from cocaine metabolites, accounting for 0. 1 % of the total samples analysed (7 % of positive results). Other stimulants found included amphetamines, ephedrines, <b>carphedon,</b> modafinil, and anorexic compounds. No amphetamine-like designer drugs were detected. These data are indicative of the widespread prevalence of cocaine and cannabis use among the young adult population. However, due to the particular population studied, it must be considered an underestimation of the phenomenon among elite athletes with respect to the general population. © 2011 Taylor & Francis...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} between ultrasonication and microwave irradiation as tools {{to achieve a}} rapid sample treatment {{for the analysis of}} banned doping substances in human urine by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed. The following variables were studied and optimised: (i) time of treatment, (ii) temperature, (iii) microwave power and (iv) ultrasonic amplitude. The results were evaluated and compared with those achieved by the routine method used in the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accredited Antidoping Laboratory of Rome. Only under the effect of the ultrasonic field was it possible to enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction rate of conjugated compounds. Similar reaction yield to the routine method was achieved after 10 min for most compounds. Under microwave irradiation, denaturation of the enzyme occurs for high microwave power. The use of both ultrasonic or microwave energy to improve the reaction rate of the derivatisation of the target compounds with trimethyliodosilane/methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (TMSI/MSTFA/NH 4 I/ 2 -mercaptoethanol) was also evaluated. To test the use of the two systems in the acceleration of the reaction with TMSI, a pool of 55 banned substances and/or their metabolites were used. After 3 min of ultrasonication, 34 of the 55 compounds had recoveries similar to those obtained with the classic procedure that lasts for 30 min (Student's∈t test, n∈=∈ 5), 18 increased to higher silylation yields, and for the compounds 13 β, 17 α-diethyl- 3 α, 17 β-dihydroxy- 5 α-gonane (norboletone metabolite 1), metoprolol and metipranolol the same results were obtained increasing the ultrasonication time to 5 min. Similar results were obtained after 3 min of microwave irradiation at 1, 200 W. In this case, 30 of the 55 compounds had recoveries similar to the classic procedure (Student's t test, n∈=∈ 5) whilst 18 had higher silylation yields. For the compounds 3 α-hydroxy- 1 α-methyl- 5 α-androstan- 17 -one (mesterolone metabolite 1), 17 α-ethyl- 5 β-estrane- 3 α, 17 β, 21 -triol (norethandrolone metabolite 1), epioxandrolone, 4 -chloro- 6 β, 17 β- dihydroxy- 17 α-methyl- 1, 4 -androstadien- 3 -one (chlormetandienone metabolite 1), <b>carphedon,</b> esmolol and bambuterol the same results were obtained after 5 min under microwave irradiation. © 2010 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
