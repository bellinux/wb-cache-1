40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} study the effect of {{cross-flow}} directions of an internal coolant on film cooling performance, the discharge coefficients and film cooling effectiveness with one inlet and double outlet hole injections were simulated.

50|$|In the Chernobyl disaster, the {{moderator}} was not {{primarily responsible for}} the primary event; instead, a massive power excursion during a mishandled test caused the catastrophic failure of the reactor vessel and a near-total loss of <b>coolant</b> <b>supply,</b> and as a result, the fuel rods rapidly melted and flowed together while in an extremely-high-power state, causing {{a small portion of}} the core to reach a state of runaway prompt criticality and leading to a massive energy release, resulting in the explosion of the reactor core and the destruction of the reactor building. However, the massive energy release during the primary event superheated the graphite of {{the moderator}}, and the disruption of the reactor vessel and building allowed the superheated graphite to come into contact with atmospheric oxygen; as a result, the graphite moderator caught fire, sending a plume of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere and over a very widespread area.|$|E

The Falcon, already operational on Air Defense Command aircraft, {{was designed to be}} used against bombers, and its slow seeker cooling times (as much as six or seven seconds to obtain a lock on a target) rendered it largely ineffective against maneuvering fighters.

5000|$|One notable feature advertised at {{the time}} was the [...] "limp home" [...] {{fail-safe}} mode which allowed the engine to continue running for a limited time without any <b>coolant.</b> <b>Supplying</b> fuel to only one cylinder bank in turn, the engine would [...] "air cool" [...] the inactive bank. This technique, combined with its all-aluminum construction and large oil capacity, allows the engine to maintain safe temperatures, allowing a Northstar-equipped car to be driven with no coolant for about 100 mi (161 km) without damage. However, the head gaskets are prone to leak, causing loss of some coolant, and high engine temperatures. These high temperatures are not enough to cause the engine to enter fail-safe mode so they can cause the block to crack.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{carry out}} the edge {{grinding}} for glass plates of flat panel displays, {{a large amount of}} <b>coolant</b> is <b>supplied</b> to prevent burning and melting on the ground surface. However, due to the repulsion of the winding air along the surface of the wheel rotating at high speed, a large amount of coolant is wasted without reaching the grinding point. This research aims to improve the grinding performance for glass edge grinding using a small amount of <b>coolant</b> <b>supplied</b> through a floating nozzle instead of a conventional nozzle. A special floating nozzle with its end covering the narrow groove formed on the wheel was made. The edge of a glass plate with a thickness of 0. 7 mm was ground under the conditions of grinding speed Vs= 1570 m/min, depth of cut a= 0. 5 mm, and feed rate Vw= 5 m/min. With a conventional nozzle, the amount of coolant needed was 3 l/min. With a floating nozzle, the amount was drastically reduced to only 0. 1 l/min. No damage occurred on the ground surface. The ground surface was also improved with the floating nozzle. The grinding force was measured. It was found that the fluctuation of grinding force in the case of floating nozzle was smaller than the one in the case of conventional nozzle...|$|R

40|$|The {{results are}} given {{of the film}} cooling {{numerical}} simulation of three different schemes including single-array of the traditional round inclined holes, as well as inclined holes arranged in the cylindrical or triangular dimples (craters).

40|$|In {{setting up}} a reactor plant for the transportation-power module of the {{megawatt}} class an important task is to optimize the path of flow, i. e. providing moderate hydraulic resistance, uniform distribution of the coolant. Significant contribution to the hydraulic losses makes one selected design of the <b>coolant</b> <b>supplies.</b> It is, in particular, hemispherical or semi-elliptical shape of the supply reservoir, which is selected to reduce its mass, resulting {{in the formation of}} torusshaped vortex in the inlet manifold, that leads to uneven coolant velocity at the inlet into the core, the flow pulsations, hydraulic losses. To control the flow redistribution in the core according to the level of energy are used the switchgear - deflectors installed in a hemispherical reservoir <b>supplying</b> <b>coolant</b> to the fuel elements (FE) of the core of gas-cooled reactor. This design solution has an effect on the structure of the flow, rate in the cooling duct, and the flow resistance of the collector. In this paper we present the results of experiments carried out on the gas dynamic model of coolant paths, deflectors, and core, comprising 55 fuel rod simulators. Numerical simulation of flow in two-parameter model, using the k-ε turbulence model, and the software package ANSYS CFX v 14. 0 is performed. The paper demonstrates that experimental results are in compliance with calculated ones.

A {{floating}} nozzle {{is characterized}} by the property of intercepting airflow around a superabrasive grinding wheel and <b>supplying</b> <b>coolant</b> to a grinding point surely by adhesion of the coolant to the wheel surface. In this method, a small clearance between the wheel surface and the nozzle tip is automatically adjusted.

In grinding difficult-to-machine materials, it has been discovered that the grinding performance of superabrasive wheel improves, when the <b>coolant</b> is <b>supplied</b> using this nozzle. In this research, the basic behavior of the coolant adhering to the surface of a rotating wheel is investigated experimentally. The results confirmed that the coolant forms a thin layer on the wheel surface. Compared with a conventional nozzle, the coolant effectively reaches the grinding point by the floating nozzle, even at a low flow rate. This means that only the coolant that is necessary for grinding is supplied. In addition, it is found that the energy consumption in terms of the current to the machine spindle motor is comparatively small...|$|R

40|$|The {{machining}} process 'grinding' is generally critically assessed concerning {{the amounts of}} heat produced during the process operation. Relatively high friction effects in abrasive machining cause heat generation {{which can lead to}} thermal damage in the surface layer of machined parts. Furthermore an inefficient cooling and lubrication system can result in higher tool wear and surface roughness. Therefore the application of cooling lubricants is of utmost importance in grinding. Usually the optimization of the <b>coolant</b> <b>supply</b> system including the selection of the coolant itself is based only upon empirical know-how or practical trial-and-error-tests. Systematic approaches using broader experimental investigations and thus resulting optimized grinding parameters or using fluid mechanical investigations in the <b>coolant</b> <b>supply</b> nozzle or in the grinding gap are not or only rarely applied.

40|$|Materials {{used in the}} {{manufacture}} of aero-engine components generally comprise of nickel and titanium base alloys. Advanced materials such as aero-engine alloys, structural ceramic and hardened steels provide serious challenges for cutting tool materials during machining due to their unique combinations of properties such as high temperature strength, hardness and chemical wear resistance. These materials are referred to as difficult-to-cut since they pose a greater challenge to manufacturing engineers due to the high temperatures and stresses generated during machining. The poor thermal conductivity of these alloys result in the concentration of high temperatures at the tool-workpiece and tool-chip interfaces, consequently accelerating tool wear and increasing manufacturing cost. The past decade has witnessed a radical approach to product manufacture, particularly in the developed economy, in order to remain competitive. Modern manufacturing philosophies, principles and techniques geared primarily towards reducing non value added activities and achieving step increase in product manufacture have been widely adopted. Recent advances in the machining of aero-engine alloys include dry machining at high speed conditions, the use of high pressure and/or ultra high pressure <b>coolant</b> <b>supplies,</b> minimum quantity lubrication, cryogenic machining and rotary (self-propelled) machining technique.

Identified a number of shortcomings of the existing methods of automatic control of the process. As a result, the authors proposed a method for drying particulate materials in the device with swirling flow and the microwave energy supply and its automatic control algorithm. The description of the operating principle of the drying apparatus consists in that the particulate material is wet by using a tangential flow of <b>coolant</b> <b>supplied</b> to the cylinder-drying apparatus which also serves the axial coolant flow, whereby the heat transfer fluid with the particulate material begins to undergo a complex circular movement along the circumference apparatus, thereby increasing its speed and its operation control algorithm.
