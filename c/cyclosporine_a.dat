25|$|Initially, rapamycin was {{developed}} as an antifungal drug against Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans. Few years later its immunosuppressive properties were detected. Later studies {{led to the}} establishment of rapamycin as a major immunosuppressant against transplant rejection, along with <b>cyclosporine</b> <b>A.</b> By using rapamycin in combination with cyclosporin A, it enhanced the rejection prevention in renal transplantation.

25|$|Globally, {{pioneering}} {{experimental studies}} in the surgical technique of human organ transplantation {{were made in the}} early 1900s by the French surgeon Alexis Carrel, and successful transplants starting spreading worldwide after the Second World War. China herself began organ transplantation in the 1960s, which grew to an annual peak of over 13,000 transplants in 2004; and, despite some deaths from infection and hepatitis, the transplant programme has been successful in saving many lives. Though the number of transplants fell to under 11,000 annually by 2005, China still has one of the largest transplant programmes in the world. China explores innovative surgery, such as the world's first flesh and bone face transplant, performed by Professor Guo Shuzhong. Organ donation, however, has met resistance, and involuntary organ donation is illegal under Chinese law, as it is against Chinese tradition and culture, which attach symbolic life affirming importance to the kidney and heart. China is not alone in encountering donation difficulties; demand outstrips supply in most countries. The world-wide shortage has encouraged some countries—such as India—to trade in human organs. Reports of organs being removed from executed prisoners in China for sale internationally had been circulating since the mid-1980s, when a 1984 regulation made it legal to harvest organs from convicted criminals with the consent of the family or if the body goes unclaimed. Development of an immunosuppressant drug, <b>cyclosporine</b> <b>A,</b> made transplants a more viable option for patients.|$|E
