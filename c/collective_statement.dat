2500|$|In a 1982 {{published}} {{conversation about}} black feminism and lesbian activism with her sister, Beverly Smith, Barbara Smith, {{co-author of the}} Combahee River <b>Collective</b> <b>Statement</b> expresses concerns that, [...] "to the extent that lesbians of color must struggle simultaneously against the racism of white women (as against sexism), separatism impedes the building of alliances with men of color". Smith writes that race places lesbians of color in a different relation to men as white lesbians, as [...] "white women with class privilege don't share oppression with white men. They're in a critical and antagonistic position whereas Black women and other women of color definitely share oppressed situations with men of their race". Smith makes {{a distinction between the}} theory of separatism, and the practice of separatism, stating that it is the way separatism has been practiced which has led to [...] "an isolated, single-issued understanding and practice of politics, which ignores the range of oppressions that women experience".|$|E

According to the IRIN news service, an Interior Ministry official, speaking {{on the condition of}} anonymity, said: “We presented an appeal to revoke the previous ruling on the basis that neither the Egyptian constitution nor Islamic law recognize Bahaism [...] as a religion unto itself.” [...] Then on 13 May 2006 Kifayah, a loosely organized group of civil society organizations, journalists, writers, artists and academics, issued a <b>collective</b> <b>statement</b> calling for an end to discrimination against Bahá'ís.

2500|$|On November 30, 2010, [...] the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{released}} the [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" [...] Comprehensive Review Working Group (CRWG) report authored by Jeh C. Johnson, General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and Army General Carter F. Ham. It outlined {{a path to}} the implementation of repeal of DADT. The report indicated that there was a low risk of service disruptions due to repealing the ban, provided time was provided for proper implementation and training. It included the results of a survey of 115,000 active-duty and reserve service members. Across all service branches, 30 percent thought that integrating gays into the military would have negative consequences. In the Marine Corps and combat specialties, the percentage with that negative assessment ranged from 40 to 60 percent. The CRWG also said that 69 percent of all those surveyed believed they had already worked with a gay or lesbian and of those, 92 percent reported that the impact of that person's presence was positive or neutral. The same day, in response to the CRWG, 30 professors and scholars, most from military institutions, issued a joint statement saying that the CRWG [...] "echoes more than 20 studies, including studies by military researchers, all of which reach the same conclusion: allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly will not harm the military .... We hope that our <b>collective</b> <b>statement</b> underscores that the debate about the evidence is now officially over...." [...] The Family Research Council's president, Tony Perkins, interpreted the CRWG data differently, writing that it [...] "reveals that 40 percent of Marines and 25 percent of the Army could leave".|$|E

Queer of color critiques seeks an intersectional approach to disidentifying with the larger themes of [...] "racialized heteronormativity and heteropatriarchy" [...] {{in order to create}} a more representative and revolutionary critique of social categories. An example of queer of color critique can be seen in the Combahee River <b>Collective's</b> <b>statement,</b> which addresses the intersectionality of oppressions faced by black lesbians.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{challenges}} {{to affirmative action}} practices in higher education have pressed college and university presidents to clarify and sometimes to legally defend the educational value of diversity. On the public front, they have made themselves available to the media (Lee Bollinger interviewed in Weiss, 2001) and written articles for periodicals and alumni magazines (Rudenstine, 1996). Even former presidents have joined in this effort by empirically docu-menting the value of affirmative action (Bowen & Bok, 1998). Some {{of the most prestigious}} and selective institutions in the nation have also issued <b>collective</b> <b>statements.</b> For example, the Association of American Universi-ties (AAU) purchased advertising space in the New York Times to issue a statement that emphasized the significance of racial diversity to the very concept of higher education. They cautioned that without diversity the quality and texture of education would be significantly diminished (AAU, 1997).

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 524 p. The dissertation compares the legal thought of four of the most active radical groups of the English Revolution [...] the Levellers, the Diggers, the Quakers, and the Fifth Monarchy Men. Analyzing the printed works of each group this study examines both legal theory and concrete criticisms and proposed reforms of the law. It attempts to show the relationship between each group's legal ideas and its political, social, and economic thought. In doing this, the dissertation reveals how law reform is also a good standard with which to measure more general similarities and differences within the mental worlds of the radicals. Many of the same reform demands appeared in the popular pamphlets and <b>collective</b> <b>statements</b> produced by each group. Yet, it is also demonstrated how different radicals took standard, accepted seventeenth-century legal and constitutional concepts and adapted them to their own needs and worldviews. By charting this creative adaptation, this dissertation touches upon broader themes concerning law and society in seventeenth-century England...|$|R

40|$|This {{essay is}} {{intended}} to be read as a supplement to the article “Iraq and the Serious Consequences of Word Games: Language, Violence and Responsibility in the Security Council,” which was published in the German Law Journal in 2002. The date of publication of the 2002 article (1 November) was exactly one week before the Security Council voted on Resolution 1441 (8 November). Resolution 1441 subsequently became (and has remained) the site of interpretative debate {{on the question of whether}} states, notably the US and the UK, needed express authorization in a new (post-Resolution 1441) Security Council resolution in order for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 to have been lawful. As the original essay was able to take into account the evolution of negotiations only up to 28 October 2002, before going to press, the present essay continues the narrative by tracing the trajectory of Resolution 1441 ’s textual language from the provisions of the first US–UK draft (of October 21, 2002) to the final form that Security Council Resolution 1441 took when adopted on 8 November 2002. The article also digests, primarily by way of two charts, the positions taken by key States on the meaning of Resolution 1441 after its adoption. The focus is the explanation of vote by each of the 15 Security Council members as well as two <b>collective</b> <b>statements</b> by France and Russia, joined by China in one case and by Germany in the second case. As noted briefly in the article, the normative politics of word games identified in the original and the present German Law Journal article is relevant, inter alia, to any legal analysis that the UK Iraq Inquiry may carry out as part of its eventual report of the involvement of the UK in the war...|$|R

Therefore the sequential race track betting gives a natural approach to inducing the consensus probabilities in Eisenberg and Gale. These consensus probabilities are di#erent from the average of the subjective probabilities which is used in the conventional way of combining individually held opinions into a <b>collective</b> group <b>statement.</b> We compare these probabilities and this leads to a potential explanation of the favorite-longshot bias consistently observed in the studies of race track betting...|$|R
