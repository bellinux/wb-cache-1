50|$|Following {{the death}} of Charlemagne, {{the lack of a}} figure with equal {{prestige}} led the new institution into disagreement. At the same time the universal church of Rome had to face emergence of the lay interests of the City itself, spurred on by the conviction that the Roman people, though impoverished and abased, had again the right to elect the Western Emperor. The famous <b>counterfeit</b> <b>document</b> called the Donation of Constantine, prepared by the Papal notaries, guaranteed to the Pope a dominion stretching from Ravenna to Gaeta. This nominally included the suzerainty over Rome, but this was often highly disputed, and as the centuries passed, only the strongest Popes were to be able to assert it. The main element of weakness of the Papacy within the walls of the city was the continued necessity of the election of new popes, in which the emerging noble families soon managed to insert a leading role for themselves. The neighbouring powers, namely the Duchy of Spoleto and Toscana, and later the Emperors, learned how to take their own advantage of this internal weakness, playing the role of arbiters among the contestants.|$|E
40|$|AbstractForgery {{detection}} of official documents is a continuous challenge encountered by documents’ forensic experts. Among {{the most common}} <b>counterfeited</b> <b>documents</b> we may find citizen cards, passports and driving licenses. Forgers are increasingly resorting to more sophisticated techniques to produce fake documents, trying to deceive criminal polices and hamper their work. Having an updated past <b>counterfeited</b> <b>documents</b> image catalogue enables forensic experts {{to determine if a}} similar technique or material was already used to forge a document. Thus, through the modus operandi characterization is possible to obtain more information about the source of the <b>counterfeited</b> <b>document.</b> In this paper we present an information system to manage <b>counterfeited</b> <b>documents</b> images that includes a two-fold approach: (i) the storage of images of past <b>counterfeited</b> <b>documents</b> seized by questioned documents forensic experts of the Portuguese Scientific Laboratory in a structured database; and (ii) the automation of the counterfeit identification by comparing a given fraudulent document image with the database images of previously catalogued <b>counterfeited</b> <b>documents.</b> In general, the proposed information system aims to smooth the counterfeit identification and to overcome the error prone, manual and time consuming tasks carried on by forensic experts. Hence, we have used a scalable algorithm under the OpenCV framework, to compare images, match patterns and analyse textures and colours. The algorithm was tested on a subset of counterfeited Portuguese citizen cards, presenting very promising results...|$|R

50|$|On 5 March 1992, German {{magazine}} Stern {{published a}} claim that the Israeli prosecution concealed crucial information about the Travniki card being a forgery, and that the Israelis had the full co-operation of the German police and the Ministry of Justice. The article stated that on 23 January 1986, {{three weeks before the}} trial, Superintendent Amnon Bezaleli took the original Trawniki card for examination at the German police force's main criminal-identification laboratory at the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) in Wiesbaden. Bezaleli was the prosecution's central witness on the Trawniki document. According to Stern, the BKA, after a cursory examination, told Bezaleli that this was a <b>counterfeit</b> <b>document</b> forged in a more or less amateur way. The laboratory's preliminary analysis addressed the following points: the face in the photograph, which the prosecution identified as Demjanjuk's, had been pasted onto the uniform using photomontage techniques; the picture was not originally attached to the card, but had been transferred from another document; there was no match between the seal on the Travniki picture and that on the document itself. The analysts did not have time to compare Demjanjuk's known signature with the Demjanjuk signature on the Travniki document. Dr. Louis Ferdinand Werner, head of the BKA, speculated to Bezaleli in a private conversation that the card was counterfeit. Bezaleli consulted people from the state prosecutor's office in Jerusalem, then instructed Werner to stop all tests on the card.|$|E
40|$|Graphic design {{applications}} {{are often used}} for the editing and design of digital art. The same applications {{can be used for}} creating counterfeit documents such as identity documents (IDs), driver’s licences, passports, etc. However, the use of any graphic design application leaves behind traces of digital information that can be used during a digital forensic investigation. Current digital forensic tools examine a system to find digital evidence, but they do not examine a system specifically for the creating of counterfeit documents created through the use of graphic {{design applications}}. The paper in hand reviews the system-generated digital forensic evidence gathered from certain graphic design applications, which indicates that a <b>counterfeit</b> <b>document</b> was created. This inference is made by associating the digital forensic information gathered with the possible actions taken, more specifically, the scanning, editing, saving and printing of counterfeit documents.

40|$|The {{system is}} a single hyperspectral imaging {{instrument}} that has the unique capability to acquire both fluorescence and reflectance high-spatial-resolution data that is inherently spatially and spectrally registered. Potential uses of this instrument include plant stress monitoring, <b>counterfeit</b> <b>document</b> detection, biomedical imaging, forensic imaging, and general materials identification. Until now, reflectance and fluorescence spectral imaging have been performed by separate instruments. Neither a reflectance spectral image nor a fluorescence spectral image alone yields as much information about a target surface as does {{a combination of the}} two modalities. Before this system was developed, to benefit from this combination, analysts needed to perform time-consuming post-processing efforts to co-register the reflective and fluorescence information. With this instrument, the inherent spatial and spectral registration of the reflectance and fluorescence images minimizes the need for this post-processing step. The main challenge for this technology is to detect the fluorescence signal in the presence of a much stronger reflectance signal. To meet this challenge, the instrument modulates artificial light sources from ultraviolet through the visible to the near-infrared part of the spectrum; in this way, both the reflective and fluorescence signals can be measured through differencing processes to optimize fluorescence and reflectance spectra as needed. The main functional components of the instrument are a hyperspectral imager, an illumination system, and an image-plane scanner. The hyperspectral imager is a one-dimensional (line) imaging spectrometer that includes a spectrally dispersive element and a two-dimensional focal plane detector array. The spectral range of the current imaging spectrometer is between 400 to 1, 000 nm, and the wavelength resolution is approximately 3 nm. The illumination system consists of narrowband blue, ultraviolet, and other discrete wavelength light-emitting-diode (LED) sources and white-light LED sources designed to produce consistently spatially stable light. White LEDs provide illumination for the measurement of reflectance spectra, while narrowband blue and UV LEDs are used to excite fluorescence. Each spectral type of LED can be turned on or off depending on the specific remote-sensing process being performed. Uniformity of illumination is achieved by using an array of LEDs and/or an integrating sphere or other diffusing surface. The image plane scanner uses a fore optic with a field of view large enough to provide an entire scan line on the image plane. It builds up a two-dimensional image in pushbroom fashion as the target is scanned across the image plane either by moving the object or moving the fore optic. For fluorescence detection, spectral filtering of a narrowband light illumination source is sometimes necessary to minimize the interference of the source spectrum wings with the fluorescence signal. Spectral filtering is achieved with optical interference filters and absorption glasses. This dual spectral imaging capability will enable the optimization of reflective, fluorescence, and fused datasets as well as a cost-effective design for multispectral imaging solutions. This system has been used in plant stress detection studies and in currency analysis...|$|E

40|$|Graphic design {{applications}} {{are often used}} for the editing and design of digital art. The same applications {{can be used for}} creating <b>counterfeit</b> <b>documents</b> such as identity documents (IDs), driver’s licenses or passports, among others. The products of graphic {{design applications}}, however, leave behind traces of digital information which can be used during a digital forensic investigation. Although current digital forensic tools are designed to scrutinise systems with the purpose of finding digital evidence, the tools are not designed to examine such systems specifically for the purpose of identifying <b>counterfeit</b> <b>documents.</b> This dissertation reviews the digital evidence relating to the creation of <b>counterfeit</b> <b>documents</b> and gathered from graphic design applications. Digital evidence gathered in this way consists mainly of identifying and corroborating the counterfeiting events that occurred on a particular system. Firstly, such an analysis is accomplished by establishing linkages between the digital forensic information that has been gathered and the specific actions that were performed when the <b>counterfeit</b> <b>documents</b> were created. Such actions comprise scanning, editing, saving, and printing. The researcher is able to compile a dossier of the digital forensic information that is generated by such actions by analysing the files that were generated by making use of a particular graphic design application for document creation. Secondly, the researcher extends the analysis to the actual files created by the application user. These files can be used as evidence to establish linkages between the content of the <b>counterfeit</b> <b>documents</b> that are being investigated and the document editing actions that are necessary for creating such documents. The researcher gathers digital forensic information of this kind by analysing the different file types that are associated with these applications. The researcher then gathers the associated timeline evidence separately by means of a third analysis that identifies timestamps from the application’s system files and evidence files. The researcher is then able to draw a timeline from the timestamps to illustrate the sequence of events that occurred. From the digital evidence gathered in this way it is possible to propose a two-pronged counterfeiting investigation process. This proposed investigation process is application and platform independent. The researcher concludes the study by transforming the model into a working prototype by demonstrating how the prototype is capable of analysing and extracting digital forensic information from certain graphic design application file types and log files. Such a prototype is capable of identifying the system that was utilised for <b>counterfeiting</b> particular <b>documents</b> or identifying whether a specific <b>document</b> is <b>counterfeited</b> or not.
