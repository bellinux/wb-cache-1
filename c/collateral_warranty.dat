60|$|But {{though this}} {{hereditary}} relation was created very early, {{it must not}} be mistaken for such a regular inheritance as we see at this day: it was an inheritance only according to the principles from whence it was derived; by them it was modified. It was originally a military connection; and if a father loft his son under a military age, so as that he could neither lead nor judge his people, nor qualify {{the young men who}} came up under him to take arms,--in order to continue the cliental bond, and not to break up an old and strong confederacy, and thereby disperse the tribe, who should be pitched upon to head the whole, but the worthiest of blood of the deceased leader, he that ranked next to him in his life?[54] And this is Tanistry, which is a succession made up of inheritance and election, a succession in which blood is inviolably regarded, so far as it was consistent with military purposes. It was thus that our kings succeeded to the throne throughout the whole time of the Anglo-Saxon, empire. The first kings of the Franks succeeded in the same manner, and without all doubt the succession of all the inferior chieftains was regulated by a similar law. Very frequent examples occur in the Saxon times, where the son of the deceased king, if under age, was entirely passed over, and his uncle, or some remoter relation, raised to the crown; but {{there is not a single}} instance where the election has carried it out of the blood. So that, in truth, the controversy, which has been managed with such heat, whether in the Saxon times the crown was hereditary or elective, must be determined in some degree favorably for the litigants on either side; for it was certainly both hereditary and elective within the bounds, which we have mentioned. This order prevailed in Ireland, where the Northern customs were retained some hundreds of years after the rest of Europe had in a great measure receded from them. Tanistry continued in force there until the beginning of the last century. And we have greatly to regret the narrow notions of our lawyers, who abolished the authority of the Brehon law, and at the same time kept no monuments of it,--which if they had done, there is no doubt but many things of great value towards determining many questions relative to the laws, antiquities, and manners of this and other countries had been preserved. But it is clear, though it has not been, I think, observed, that the ascending collateral branch was much regarded amongst the ancient Germans, and even preferred to that of the immediate possessor, as being, in case of an accident arriving to the chief, the presumptive heir, and him on whom the hope of the family was fixed: and this is upon the principles of Tanistry. And the rule seems to have taken such deep root as to have much influenced a considerable article of our feudal law: for, what is very singular, and, I take it, otherwise unaccountable, a <b>collateral</b> <b>warranty</b> bound, even without any descending assets, where the lineal did not, unless something descended; and this subsisted invariably in the law until this century.|$|E
50|$|The term “collateral warranty” {{originates}} in property law. In 1839 Francis Hilliard wrote: “A <b>collateral</b> <b>warranty</b> {{is where the}} heir neither does nor could derive his title to the land from the warrantor; and yet is both de-barred from claiming title and bound to recompense in case of eviction.”.

40|$|Microcredit (Mc) {{is defined}} as a loan of small {{financial}} amount, provided to beneficiaries in the absence of appropriate collateral guarantees. Considering the Italian regulation, there are two categories of microcredit: Mc for entrepreneurial purposes, intended to micro-entrepreneurs and self-employed workers, and Mc for social or solidarity purposes, intended to single persons with specific situations of socioeconomic vulnerability. Mc for entrepreneurial purposes refers to loans up to € 25, 000 (in some specific cases up to € 35, 000); furthermore, the same beneficiary can receive different loans, one after the other. Mc is supplied in the absence of <b>collaterals,</b> but personal <b>warranties</b> and other forms of guarantees are allowed. The provider not only supplies a microcredit to the debtor but also some assistance and experts’ advices in order to support him/her to manage and develop his/her business. This thesis firstly introduces the theme of microcredit with a wide description of its history and its developing around the world. The modern concept of microcredit first started in Bangladesh during 1970 s, when Muhammad Yunus founded the Grameen Bank. Afterward, we analyse under a juridical perspective the European framework and the Italian regulation, with the recent ministerial decrees 1, then we examine the European and national tools implemented to foster the offer of microcredit for microenterprises and self-employed workers. Subsequently, we outline a current overview of microcredit sector in Italy and offer some considerations concerning the restrictive effects that the national regulation could generate in terms of access to microcredit in the future. These considerations are supported by elaborations conducted using data extracted from database “AIDA” and related to specific categories of firms. Then, we consider the socioeconomic characteristics related to microcredit, analysing its structural elements and showing its potentialities but also the possible drawback effects. The fundamental research question is related to the role of microcredit in Italy, considering the current regulation and the national socioeconomic context. After, we focus on the potential use of microcredit to finance farms and microenterprises in rural areas. Some considerations are developed referring to the European policies for rural development and the care for socioeconomic improvement of rural areas promoted by Rural Development Programmes (RDPs) 2014 - 2020. Respect to the specific research question, the purpose is to underline the specificities - concerning both implementation and opportunities – regarding the possible applications of microcredit in agriculture and rural development. Afterward, we describe a case study focused on a survey on social farming. The research question is if microcredit could be suitable to finance social farms and therefore to foster social farming in Italy. A short description about what is social farming and a presentation of the recent national framework regulation are done; subsequently, the thesis presents the results of the above-mentioned survey conducted on a sample of social farms, interviewed by questionnaires using a Computer Assisted Web Interviewing” (CAWI). The objective is to give an overview of social farms in Italy, focusing on their structure, their financial needs, the services offered and the effects of the new regulation regarding the possibilities of current social farms to be recognised by the law. The specific research question is to understand if microcredit can be a suitable instrument to finance a relevant segment of social farms and consequently to foster social farming in Italy. Finally, some conclusions are offered. In a nutshell, in the italian context the economic weight of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is very relevant and wide segments of firms - firstly, many microenterprises - don't access to the traditional credit circuit. Therefore, microcredit could take on an important role to finance specific targets and to foster the creation of new businesses, delivering also assistance and experts' advices to the entrepreneurs. The public system of guarantee funds to sustain the provision of microcredit seems to work well on the whole, {{but it has to be}} consolidated. Microcredit could take on a relevant role also in rural areas, where the supply of financings and business services is often even more lacking. Nevertheless, the national regulation establishes restrictions to access to microcredit that could be overly restrictive with respect to the objectives that the institutions want to achieve through this instrument. Both the analysis conducted on different categories of firms using data from database AIDA 2 and the results concerning the specific case study on social farms seem to confirm this element. Therefore a deep study about the current regulation of microcredit should be conducted to assess whether the above-mentioned restrictions have to be amended.

50|$|The {{meaning is}} {{different}} {{when considering the}} actual and most common use of the term. Today a <b>collateral</b> <b>warranty</b> generally defines an agreement ancillary to another principal contract and/or a letter of appointment. For the benefice of a third party, it imposes an extended duty of care and a broader liability on two separate parties involved in a contract. Collateral warranties may be provided by designers, building contractors and specialist sub-contractors. The need for collateral warranties exists when the party that commissions a building will not carry the burden {{in the event of}} defects.|$|E

Denning LJ said {{this was not a}} claim for rectification because that is concerned with contracts and documents, not with intentions. In order to get rectification, it is necessary to show that the parties were in complete agreement on the terms of their contract, but by an error wrote them down wrongly. He said {{there might have been a}} case in misrepresentation or mistake but that was not pleaded and it is very different from rectification. He added that they probably should not have dropped the claim for <b>collateral</b> <b>warranty</b> that the beans would comply with a demand for feveroles.|$|E
40|$|Collateral Warranties are {{contractual}} {{agreements between}} parties who otherwise {{might not be}} in a contractual arrangement. In {{the case of an}} Architect it is unlikely he will have a contractual relationship with purchaser, tenant and funder of the constructed building. Therefore the purpose of <b>Collateral</b> <b>Warranty</b> is to create contractual relationship between the Architect and these parties. Particular issue are raised in relation to clauses dealing with "reasonable skill and care". What does this phrase mean and how does a judge, decide whether this standard has been achieved? The objective of this research is to determine the implication of <b>Collateral</b> <b>Warranty</b> on Architects and look into the circumstances in which the Architect is either liable or not towards those defects in performing his duty. This research will be limited to cases in Malaysia, United Kingdom and United States of America, regarding detailed provision of variation clauses in relation to ‘collateral warranties’ and Architects in "exercise reasonable skill and care’ in the most commonly used standard forms of contracts, i. e. PAM 2006 Form, PWD 203 A (Rev. 10 / 83), RIBA CE/ 99, SFA/ 99, JCT and provision under Common Law. Finding from this research, Architect can be pursued by parties other than his client in <b>Collateral</b> <b>Warranty.</b> At the same time, Architect will under no circumstances have a greater liability to the third party than he already owes to the client. The use of phrase such as ‘utmost skill and care’ and ‘highest degree of skill and care’ do not tend to add to the Architect’s obligation, as the benchmark by which his performance to be judge is the exercise of such reasonable skill and care as would be exercise by a reasonably competent member of his profession. When the Architect is asked to provide <b>collateral</b> <b>warranty,</b> he is entitled to additional fees calculated on a time basis. Architect is also not liable to gives warranty on "fitness for purpose" as his obligation is to provide adequate advice in his profession to ensure client’s interest is achieved...|$|E

40|$|It is {{submitted}} {{that it is}} {{a common}} practice in the construction industry for contractors to give guarantee to employers for rectification of defects by way of collateral warranties. It is also normal for employers to assign these warranties to subsequent purchasers or lessees to enable them to directly sue the contractors when defects occur. This mechanism is effective if the defects occur subsequent to the assignment. The general principle is that the assignment may not be effective if the defects or the cause of actions are already in existence at the time when the assignment is made. However, this may not always necessarily be the case. A brief examination of the case law on this issue shows that there are certain situations, by applying certain principles, considering the wordings of the assignments and the facts of the case, courts have allowed claims for accrued cause of actions under collateral warranties. The objective of this research is to identify the principles that the judges used when dealing with the assignments that involved accrued cause of action. The methodology used in this research is by way of quantity analysis of the relevant case law. The scope of this research includes Malaysian and English cases on assignment of <b>collateral</b> <b>warranty</b> and accrued cause of action. In particular, the assignment required from the building contractor to the subsequent building owner. From the analysis, {{it was found that the}} assignment only covers the damages caused before the assignment is made and not the right to sue against the loss caused after the assignment. Further, if there is a prohibition that prevents the transfer of contract, it includes the prohibition of assignment as well; and if the assignment requires prior consent of the parties, the assignment without consent would be invali...|$|E
