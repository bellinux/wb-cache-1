40|$|We propose CentRoute a <b>centralized</b> on-demand tree-based <b>routing</b> {{protocol}} for resource constrained wireless sensor networks. CentRoute is a unicast routing protocol that utilizes source routing to form paths from a node {{to the sink}} and vice-versa. Each node in the network can connect to a single tree at a time which is controlled by a dynamically selected root (or sink). By <b>centralizing</b> <b>routing</b> decisions {{at the root of the}} tree, which is not subject to the same resource constraints as the rest of the nodes, CentRoute can avoid routing instabilities and inconsistencies, such as loops. The protocol has constant state requirements on the resource-constrained nodes and as a result can scale to networks of high density. Its on-demand nature results in a low control overhead, as the paths are maintained only when data flows through them. We evaluate the performance of our protocol using simulations as well as an experimental testbed...|$|R

Fibbing is expressive, and readily supports flexi-ble load balancing, traffic engineering, and backup routes. Based on high-level forwarding requirements, the Fibbing controller computes a compact augmented topology and in-jects the fake components through standard routing-protocol messages.

An approach {{to support such}} applications and provide inter-domain guarantees, enabling new avenues for innovation, is using <b>centralized</b> inter-domain <b>routing</b> brokers. These entities <b>centralize</b> <b>routing</b> control for mission-critical traffic across domains, working in parallel to BGP. In this work, we propose using IXPs as natural points for stitching inter-domain paths {{under the control of}} inter-domain routing brokers. To evaluate the potential of this approach, we first map the global substrate of inter-IXP pathlets that IXP members could offer, based on measurements for 229 IXPs worldwide. We show that using IXPs as stitching points has two useful properties. Up to 91 % of the total IPv 4 address space can be served by such inter-domain routing brokers when working in concert with just a handful of large IXPs and their associated ISP members. Second, path diversity on the inter-IXP graph increases by up to 29 times, as compared to current BGP valley-free routing. To exploit the rich path diversity, we introduce algorithms that inter-domain routing brokers can use to embed paths, subject to bandwidth and latency constraints. We show that our algorithms scale to the sizes of the measured graphs and can serve diverse simulated path request mixes. Our work highlights a novel direction for SDN innovation across domains, based on logically centralized control and programmable IXP fabrics.
