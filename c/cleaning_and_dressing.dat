40|$|Background Few {{guidelines}} {{exist for}} the initial management of wounds in disaster settings. As wounds sustained are often contaminated, {{there is a high}} risk of further complications from infection, both local and systemic. Healthcare workers with little to no surgical training often provide early wound care, and where resources and facilities are also often limited, and clear appropriate guidance is needed for early wound management. Methods We undertook a systematic review focusing on the nature of wounds in disaster situations, and the outcomes of wound management in recent disasters. We then presented the findings to an international consensus panel with a view to formulating a guideline for the initial management of wounds by first responders and subsequent healthcare personnel as they deploy. Results We included 62 studies in the review that described wound care challenges in a diverse range of disasters, and reported high rates of wound infection with multiple causative organisms. The panel defined a guideline in which the emphasis is on not closing wounds primarily but rather directing efforts toward <b>cleaning,</b> debridement, <b>and</b> <b>dressing</b> wounds in preparation for delayed primary closure, or further exploration and management by skilled surgeons. Conclusion Good wound care in disaster settings, as outlined in this article, can be achieved with relatively simple measures, and have important mortality and morbidity benefits. © 2014 Société Internationale de Chirurgie...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Neglecting {{polarized}} light as an adjuvant therapy for pressure ulcers and methodology distinctions in the trials engaging {{polarized light}} {{are the reasons}} for many dilemmas and contradictions. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the effects of polarized light therapy in pressure ulcer healing. Methods. This prospective randomized single-blind study involved 40 patients with stage I-III of pressure ulcer. The patients in the experimental group (E) were subjected, besides polarized light therapy, to standard wound <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>dressing.</b> Standard wound <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>dressing</b> were the only treatment used in the control group (C). A polarized light source was a Bioptron lamp. Polarized light therapy was applied for six min daily, five times a week, four weeks. The Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) was used in the assessment of outcome. Statistic analysis included Mann Whitney Test, Fisher Exact Test, Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Results. There were significant differences between the groups at the end of the treatment regarding the surface of pressure ulcer (E: 10. 80 ± 19. 18; C: 22, 97 ± 25, 47; p = 0. 0005), rank of pressure ulcer (E: 5. 90 ± 2. 48; C: 8. 6 ± 1. 05; p = 0. 0005) and total PUSH score (E: 7. 35 ± 3. 17; C: 11. 85 ± 2. 35; p = 0, 0003). The patients in the experimental group had significantly better values of the parameters monitored than the patients in the control group. Conclusion. After a four-week polarized light therapy 20 patients with stage I-III ulcer had significant improvement in pressure ulcer healing, so it could be useful to apply polarized light in the treatment of pressure ulcers...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT CONTEXT: Myiasis {{is caused}} by larval {{infestation}} that usually occurs in exposed wounds. Dermatobia hominis {{is the most common}} fly species responsible for this parasitic infection. Genital piercing is an ornamental practice used in certain social circles. At placement, it transverses the skin surface and, as such, may be related to complications. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 31 -year-old man with a history of wound infection secondary to genital piercing who was exposed to an environment with flies, leading to myiasis. Mechanical removal and systemic antiparasitic drugs are possible treatments for myiasis. However, prevention that includes wound <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>dressing</b> {{is the best way to}} avoid this disease. CONCLUSIONS: Genital piercing can lead to potential complications and myiasis may occur when skin lesions are not properly treated...|$|E

In previous work, we demonstrated that a keratin biomaterial hydrogel appeared to reduce burn wound progression. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that a modified keratin hydrogel could reduce burn wound progression and speed healing. Standardized burn wounds were created in Yorkshire swine and treated within 30 minutes with keratin hydrogel (modified and unmodified), collagen hydrogel, or silver sulfadiazine (SSD). Digital images of each wound were taken for area measurements immediately prior to <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>dressing</b> changes. Wound tissue was collected and assessed histologically at several time points. Wound area showed a significant difference between hydrogels and SSD groups, and rates of reepithelialization at early time points showed an increase when keratin treatment was used compared to both collagen and SSD. A linear regression model predicted a time to wound closure of approximately 25 days for keratin hydrogel while SSD treatment required 35 days.

To prevent this, various techniques are used: seed heat treatment, ultrasound treatment, brush <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> seed <b>dressing</b> with plant extracts or natural chemicals. In 2008, the efficiency of wheat seed treatment with the stone meal was tested and the results of preliminary investigation are presented. Two tests were performed using the official procedure for seed health testing. Test 1 : Heavily infected wheat seed was treated with the stone meal EKORAST (particle size < 0. 08 mm). Dry and wet treatment procedures were applied: both with 1, 2, 10 and 20 %. Heavy application (10 and 20 kg per 100 kg of seed) significantly increased germination and energy of wheat seed, and it was effective against bacterial pathogens and some fungi, but only partially effective against heavy infection of Fusarium spp. However, the amounts of stone meal (10 and 20 %) are practically not applicable, and adhesion of stone meal to the seed should be improved.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To obtain {{knowledge}} about the use and distribution of hazardous chemicals in Danish industry. This knowledge is used to regulate the occupational environment and prevent hazardous exposure. METHODS [...] A national survey {{on the use of}} chemicals was carried out in 1989 in a stratified sample of 1448 Danish businesses. 13, 000 different chemical products were reported. Information on components in the chemical products was obtained from the Danish product register data base (PROBAS) and by inquiries to suppliers and manufacturers. At {{the end of the study}} the composition of about 9400 of the products was known. A model was developed to estimate national numbers of chemical exposure events as a supplement to data on weights of chemicals used. RESULTS [...] Data are presented for 36 chemical substances with chronic toxic effects and high estimated national numbers of exposure events for the industry groups included in the survey. Seven of the 36 substances are carcinogens, 17 are reproductive toxicants, 12 are allergens, and 18 are neurotoxicants according to listings of chronic toxicants used by the Danish authorities. The largest national number of exposure events was estimated for the industry groups manufacture of fabricated metal products, <b>and</b> personal services, <b>cleaning,</b> <b>and</b> hair <b>dressing.</b> These should have special attention in further preventive work.

50|$|Infected meat, however, {{should be}} {{eliminated}} through systematic meat inspection in production, and consequently, consumers will more often encounter meat exogenously spoiled by bacteria or fungi {{after the death}} of the animal. One source of infectious organisms is bacteraemia, the presence of bacteria in the blood of slaughtered animals. The large intestine of animals contains some 3.3×1013 viable bacteria, which may infect the flesh after death if the carcass is improperly dressed. Contamination can also occur at the slaughterhouse through the use of improperly cleaned slaughter or dressing implements, such as powered knives, on which bacteria persist. A captive bolt pistol's bolt alone may carry about 400,000 bacteria per square centimeter.

30|$|The Checketts–Otterburn PTI {{classification}} {{is commonly}} used {{as a guide to}} decision-making because it provides valuable information regarding treatment [34]. This classification distinguishes between two groups of PTI—minor (grades 1 – 3) and major (grades 4 – 6)—with the main difference being that the external fixation pin has to be removed in cases of major infection (see Table 1). Although PTI is common, very few cases lead to major complications, and most PTI are mild and may therefore respond to increased local pin site care. It is thus legitimate and safe to start treatment of a grade 1 PTI by increasing the frequency of local <b>cleaning</b> <b>and</b> <b>dressing</b> changes; it is also advisable to use more absorbent dressings in cases with excessive exudate. Hydrofibres can absorb large amounts of wound fluids, including exudate with bacteria. This is then transformed into a soft gel which creates a moist environment to support the body’s healing process. Furthermore, silver-releasing dressings have been proven to be as effective as oral antibiotics for controlling PTI; they could thus constitute the first-line therapy [78]. For a grade 2 Checketts–Otterburn PTI, not only should pin site care be improved, but patients should be treated with a course of oral antibiotics. Swabbing of the infected pin site is advised before initiating 7 – 10  days of oral antibiotics aimed at S. aureus. If the PTI resolves within that 7 - to 10 -day course of antibiotic, the medication can be discontinued, and regular pin site care may be resumed. A patient with grade 3 Checketts–Otterburn PTI should be admitted to hospital for intravenous antibiotics, inpatient pin site care and limb elevation. If these grade 3 PTI do not respond adequately to treatment, the pins or wires involved should be removed and changed, but external fixation can continue.|$|E
