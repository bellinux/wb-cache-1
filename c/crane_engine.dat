50|$|High-tide in the River Mersey {{had been}} about 11:15 pm and the East Float was full of water, at around 12:25 am the {{foundation}} of the coffer dam gave way without warning, the fifteen workers were overwhelmed by water and debris. A platform carrying the <b>crane,</b> <b>engine</b> and boiler collapsed into the excavation, it is believed trapped the men underwater. Fourteen-men were killed, but one survived by clinging on the dock wall until he was rescued. The engine-driver and boy acting as a signaller were swept into the water but were rescued, the boy being trapped between baulks of timer later had his leg amputated. The disaster widowed seven women and left 13 children fatherless. It took a month for divers to recover all the bodies, and the victims were buried in three mass graves in Flaybrick Hill Cemetery, Birkenhead, now known as Flaybrick Memorial Gardens.|$|E

50|$|In 1865 Ralph Coulthard {{retired and}} the works {{was taken over}} by William Black and Thomas Hawthorn, who {{concentrated}} on industrial tank locomotives, both four and six coupled. The company supplied steam locomotives to collieries and works, particularly in North East England.

When they started the <b>crane's</b> <b>engine,</b> the engine vibrations sent the crane toppling backwards into the water. One man, John Gibson, jumped clear. Sause and Harold Holmes were knocked unconscious and then were rescued by Gibson; the fourth man, Charles Sanderson, was trapped in the cab and drowned {{at the bottom of the}} river.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} powered by three Caterpillar Diesel Generator sets. One ran {{at all times}} {{providing}} power for the station. Multiple storage tanks were situated around the station to hold fuel for these generators. On a lower level from the station was a boat house and a <b>crane</b> <b>engine</b> building. The crane was operated by another Caterpillar engine. The island had no landing place with sheer cliffs rising on all sides. To get on or off the island, other than by helicopter, the crane was {{hooked up to a}} sixteen-foot fiberglass boat with an outboard engine, The men would climb into the boat and be swung by the crane {{over the edge of the}} island and dropped the sixty feet to the water. To get back on the boat had to be maneuvered under the hook at the base of the cliff, attached and lifted back up. Needless to say this was not any easy feat and was seldom done in rough weather. Resupply was accomplished the same way, hoisting cargo nets of supplies up onto the boathouse deck.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{continuous}} evolution in computers and information technology, real-world combinatorial optimization problems are NP-problems, {{in particular in}} the domain of planning and scheduling. Thus, although exact techniques from the Operations Research (OR) field, such as Linear Programming, could be applied to solve optimization problems, they are difficult to apply in real-world scenarios since they usually require too much computational time, i. e: an optimized solution is required at an affordable computational time. Furthermore, decision makers often face different and typically opposing goals, then resulting multi-objective optimization problems. Therefore, approximate techniques from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field are commonly used to solve the real world problems. The AI techniques provide richer and more flexible representations of real-world (Gomes 2000), and they are widely used to solve these type of problems. AI heuristic techniques do not guarantee the optimal solution, but they provide near-optimal solutions in a reasonable time. These techniques are divided into two broad classes of algorithms: constructive and local search methods (Aarts and Lenstra 2003). They can guide their search processes by means of heuristics or metaheuristics depending on how they escape from local optima (Blum and Roli 2003). Regarding multi-objective optimization problems, the use of AI techniques becomes paramount due to their complexity (Coello Coello 2006). Nowadays, the point of view for planning and scheduling tasks has changed. Due to the fact that real world is uncertain, imprecise and non-deterministic, there might be unknown information, breakdowns, incidences or changes, which become the initial plans or schedules invalid. Thus, there is a new trend to cope these aspects in the optimization techniques, and to seek robust solutions (schedules) (Lambrechts, Demeulemeester, and Herroelen 2008). In this way, these optimization problems become harder since a new objective function (robustness measure) {{must be taken into account}} during the solution search. Therefore, the robustness concept is being studied and a general robustness measure has been developed for any scheduling problem (such as Job Shop Problem, Open Shop Problem, Railway Scheduling or Vehicle Routing Problem). To this end, in this thesis, some techniques have been developed to improve the search of optimized and robust solutions in planning and scheduling problems. These techniques offer assistance to decision makers to help in planning and scheduling tasks, determine the consequences of changes, provide support in the resolution of incidents, provide alternative plans, etc. As a case study to evaluate the behaviour of the techniques developed, this thesis focuses on problems related to container terminals. Container terminals generally serve as a transshipment zone between ships and land vehicles (trains or trucks). In (Henesey 2006 a), it is shown how this transshipment market has grown rapidly. Container terminals are open systems with three distinguishable areas: the berth area, the storage yard, and the terminal receipt and delivery gate area. Each one presents different planning and scheduling problems to be optimized (Stahlbock and Voß 2008). For example, berth allocation, quay crane assignment, stowage planning, and quay crane scheduling must be managed in the berthing area; the container stacking problem, yard crane scheduling, and horizontal transport operations must be carried out in the yard area; and the hinterland operations must be solved in the landside area. Furthermore, dynamism is also present in container terminals. The tasks of the container terminals take place in an environment susceptible of breakdowns or incidences. For instance, a Quay <b>Crane</b> <b>engine</b> stopped working and needs to be revised, delaying this task one or two hours. Thereby, the robustness concept can be included in the scheduling techniques to take into consideration some incidences and return a set of robust schedules. In this thesis, we have developed a new domain-dependent planner to obtain more effi- cient solutions in the generic problem of reshuffles of containers. Planning heuristics and optimization criteria developed have been evaluated on realistic problems and they are applicable to the general problem of reshuffling in blocks world scenarios. Additionally, we have developed a scheduling model, using constructive metaheuristic techniques on a complex problem that combines sequences of scenarios with different types of resources (Berth Allocation, Quay Crane Assignment, and Container Stacking problems). These problems are usually solved separately and their integration allows more optimized solutions. Moreover, in order to address the impact and changes that arise in dynamic real-world environments, a robustness model has been developed for scheduling tasks. This model has been applied to metaheuristic schemes, which are based on genetic algorithms. The extension of such schemes, incorporating the robustness model developed, allows us to evaluate and obtain more robust solutions. This approach, combined with the classical optimality criterion in scheduling problems, allows us to obtain, in an efficient in way, optimized solution able to withstand a greater degree of incidents that occur in dynamic scenarios. Thus, a proactive approach is applied to the problem that arises with the presence of incidences and changes that occur in typical scheduling problems of a dynamic real world. Rodríguez Molins, M.

50|$|The company rapidly {{developed}} {{a range of}} traction engines, steam rollers, ploughing engines, agricultural implements and stationary engines. One of their forgotten achievements is the invention (see British Patent 763 of 1880) of the traction-centre engine, for driving steam-powered fairground roundabouts. This is often wrongly attributed to Savage of King's Lynn. In the 1890s, McLaren {{developed a}} range of vertical triple-expansion engines for the new industry of electricity generation. The zenith of this effort {{was a pair of}} 3000 ihp engines for Leeds Corporation’s Whitehall Road Power Station. After the start of the 20th century, the company introduced a tractor for direct haulage and a range of powerful direct-ploughing engines. The largest of these, rated 125 ihp, was fitted with superheater, feedwater heater and fully lagged cylinders. This provided a very efficient engine, which won many awards both at home and abroad. Other minor products were, showmen's <b>engines,</b> <b>crane</b> <b>engines,</b> portable engines, railway locomotives and Darby Steam-Diggers.|$|R

40|$|Staff {{is proposing}} {{to address issues}} {{regarding}} two-engine on-road and off-road cranes by making both <b>engines</b> of two-engine <b>cranes</b> subject to the In-Use Off-Road Diesel Vehicle regulation and to remove the upper engines from the Portable ATCM regulation performance requirements. These issues facing the crane operators are related to safety and feasibility of repowering or retrofitting <b>crane</b> <b>engines,</b> and the complexity and unnecessary cost associated with complying with multiple regulations without any appreciable emission benefits. Two-engine cranes are defined as mobile diesel-powered machines with a hoisting mechanism mounted on a specially constructed truck chassis or carrier; one engine provides motive power, and a secondary engine is used to lift and move materials and objects. There are three general categories of two-engine cranes: lattice boom (conventional), all terrain or truck mounted. All terrain and truck mounted crane are very similar and can be categorized as truck mounted hydraulic cranes. The motive or drive engine is on-road engine. The secondary engine is off-road engine. B. Issues Concerns by crane operators regarding on-road cranes raised late during the off-road regulatory development process {{and could not be}} evaluated and workshopped in time to include them in the off-road regulation. The crane owners and operators requested that the two-engine cranes be included in the In-Use Off-Road Diesel Regulation...|$|R
50|$|Most <b>engine</b> <b>cranes</b> are {{equipped}} with a telescopic boom which can be extended to reach engine blocks located further into the engine compartment. At {{the end of the}} boom there is a grab hook where lifting chains, slings or a load leveler can be attached for lifting purposes.|$|R
50|$|These {{telescopic}} cranes are single-engine machines, {{with the}} same engine powering the undercarriage and the crane, similar to a crawler crane. In a rough terrain <b>crane,</b> the <b>engine</b> is usually mounted in the undercarriage {{rather than in the}} upper, as with crawler crane. Most have 4 wheel drive and 4 wheel steering which allows them to traverse tighter and slicker terrain than a standard truck crane with less site prep. In addition, there are rough terrain cranes with the operating cab mounted on the lower as opposed to the P&H in the above image.|$|R

50|$|Indo Farm {{commenced}} {{commercial production}} of tractors in October 2000 at its plant located at Baddi in District Solan, Himachal Pradesh. Spread over {{an area of}} 34 acres, the plant started with {{the production of a}} single model.

Within a year of its operations, the company had successfully indigenized the engine components, manufacturing and assembly processes, and accordingly stopped import of engines. In 2008, the company diversified into manufacturing and marketing of Pick-N-Carry cranes of 9 tonnes - 20 tonnes capacity and has recently commenced production of mobile tower <b>cranes</b> too. <b>Engines</b> being the company's core competence area, it is now making engines for generator sets that are exported overseas.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the reasons}} that the van was less popular with fleet {{operators}} than the Bedford and Ford Transit models it sold against was that, as on the BMC J2 and J4 models the forward-control design restricted access to the engine and made engine changes labour-intensive; the only way to remove the engine without dropping the suspension subframe was to remove the windscreen and <b>crane</b> the <b>engine</b> out through the passenger door. A 1974 road test of a motor caravan version fitted with the 1725cc engine reported a maximum speed of 70 mph and a 0-50 mph (80 km/h) time of 25 seconds, indicating a higher top speed but, in this form, slower acceleration than the BMC competitor.

60|$|We came then {{near the}} river. We {{spent a long}} time walking about the noisy streets flanked by high stone walls, {{watching}} the working of <b>cranes</b> and <b>engines</b> and often being shouted at for our immobility by the drivers of groaning carts. It was noon when we reached the quays and, as all the labourers seemed to be eating their lunches, we bought two big currant buns and sat down to eat them on some metal piping beside the river. We pleased ourselves with the spectacle of Dublin's commerce--the barges signalled from far away by their curls of woolly smoke, the brown fishing fleet beyond Ringsend, the big white sailing-vessel which was being discharged on the opposite quay. Mahony said it would be right skit to run away to sea on one of those big ships and even I, looking at the high masts, saw, or imagined, the geography which had been scantily dosed to me at school gradually taking substance under my eyes. School and home seemed to recede from us and their influences upon us seemed to wane.|$|R
5000|$|Railway {{station in}} Novocherkassk was opened in 1863. The idea of {{building}} the railway from Aksay to Alexandro-Grushevskaya (Shakhty) via Novocherkassk was proposed by appointed ataman Mikheil Homutov. Homutov requested the Minister for War of Russian Empire to build this railway line. In his opinion, new railway should {{solve the problem of}} delivery of coal from deposits near Alexandro-Grushevskaya to barges on the river Don. This resolution was supported by the imperial decrees of 16 May 1860. Rolling stock, hydraulic <b>cranes</b> and steam <b>engines</b> were purchased in Belgium. The construction and operation of the Grushevsko-Don Railways was managed by a special committee headed by Count Valerian Panaev (engineer).|$|R

30|$|The {{design of}} most complex {{products}} and systems like <b>crane</b> vessel, diesel <b>engines</b> etc., are mainly done by redesigning or making changes on existing predecessor designs until all new arising requirements are met (Smith et al. 2012; Romli and Harmin 2015). The main goal of any product redesigning exercise {{is to create}} new products and systems that meet the customer requirements {{as well as the}} product reliability. In identifying product component(s) to be redesign, the customer/user requirements which are mainly considered (Risdiyono and Koomsap 2013; Liu et al. 2012, 2014; Shieh et al. 2008; Shin et al. 2015) and achieved through customer surveys using the quality function deployment (QFD) tool, often fail to guarantee or cover aspects of the product reliability. According to Dietrich (2006), only very few customers will specify the traditional reliability requirements in terms of mean time between failures (MTBF), Failure rate or the probability of failure occurrence.

Then the locomotive was returned to the Betriebswerk, where it first went to the coaling plant, where its coal was replenished. Next the engine proceeded to the ashpit where the boiler was cleaned out by the shed workers (Betriebsarbeiter). This involved emptying the ash and clinker from the smokebox and grate into an ashpit sunk between the tracks. This was a particularly dirty job. After completely cleaning out the boiler the engine was run to the water <b>cranes,</b> where the <b>engine's</b> water tanks were refilled. The next stop was the sanding point. At smaller Betriebswerke, refilling the sanders was manual work using buckets and ladders.|$|R
