2500|$|Simpson {{along with}} Robert Dale Owen {{was a party}} leader and {{political}} candidate of The Philadelphia Party, {{also known as the}} Working Men's Party (18281831). Simpson and Owen embraced some of the radical social principles of Thomas Jefferson regarding banks, believing that labor created all wealth and that inequality was caused by excessive ownership of private property and other monopolies. By 1800 most people who worked at common trades, on farms or did other <b>common</b> <b>labor</b> preferred the party of Jefferson and James Madison over the party of Washington and Alexander Hamilton. In the Jacksonian period, Working Men's parties arose including associations of farmers, factory workers and city mechanics. Trade unions consisted of skilled artisans organized in their respective craft societies, such as Philadelphia's cordwainers, hatters and carpenters. These various organizations were America's first labor movement. They were often led by men who had not themselves been workers; Simpson was one of these. The [...] "Workies" [...] sought universal male suffrage, free public education, and protection from debtor imprisonment. They opposed compulsory service in the militia and competition from prison contract labor.|$|E

A collier working by the piece is supposed, at Newcastle, to earn commonly about double, and {{in many parts of}} Scotland about three times, the wages of <b>common</b> <b>labor.</b> His high wages arise altogether from the hardship, disagreeableness, and dirtiness of his work. His employment may, upon most occasions, be as constant as he pleases. The coal-heavers in London exercise a trade which in hardship, dirtiness, and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers; and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal-ships, {{the employment}} of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant. If colliers, therefore, commonly earn double and triple the wages of <b>common</b> <b>labor,</b> it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal-heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages. In the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago, it was found that, at the rate at which they were then paid, they could earn about four times the wages of <b>common</b> <b>labor</b> in London.” ...|$|E

Benevolence to the whole species, and want of feeling for every individual with whom the professors come in contact, form the character of the new philosophy. Setting up for an unsocial independence, this their hero of vanity refuses the just price of <b>common</b> <b>labor,</b> as well as the tribute which opulence owes to genius, and which, when paid, honors the giver and the receiver, and then pleads his beggary as an excuse for his crimes. He melts with tenderness for those only who touch him by the remotest relation, and then, without one natural pang, casts away, as a sort of offal and excrement, the spawn of his disgustful amours, and sends his children to the hospital of foundlings.

60|$|As <b>common</b> <b>labor,</b> {{which is}} a mode of pain, is the {{exercise}} of the grosser, a mode of terror is the exercise of the finer parts of the system; and if a certain mode of pain be of such a nature as to act upon the eye or the ear, as {{they are the most}} delicate organs, the affection approaches more nearly to that which has a mental cause. In all these cases, if the pain and terror are so modified as not to be actually noxious; if the pain is not carried to violence, and the terror is not conversant about the present destruction of the person, as these emotions clear the parts, whether fine or gross, of a dangerous and troublesome incumbrance, they are capable of producing delight; not pleasure, but a sort of delightful horror, a sort of tranquillity tinged with terror; which, as it belongs to self-preservation, is one of the strongest of all the passions. Its object is the sublime.[33] Its highest degree I call astonishment; the subordinate degrees are awe, reverence, and respect, which, by the very etymology of the words, show from what source they are derived, and how they stand distinguished from positive pleasure.|$|E

60|$|It is that new-invented virtue {{which your}} masters canonize that led their moral hero {{constantly}} to exhaust the stores of his powerful rhetoric in {{the expression of}} universal benevolence, whilst his heart was incapable of harboring one spark of common parental affection. Benevolence to the whole species, and want of feeling for every individual with whom the professors come in contact, form {{the character of the}} new philosophy.

60|$|Thus far we have, {{throughout}} this discussion, proceeded on the supposition that competition is free, {{so far as}} regards human interference; being limited only by natural causes, or by the unintended effect of general social circumstances. But law or custom may interfere to limit competition. If apprentice laws, or the regulations of corporate bodies, make the access to a particular employment slow, costly, or difficult, the wages of that employment may be kept much above their natural proportion to the wages of <b>common</b> <b>labor.</b> In some trades, however, and to some extent, the combinations of workmen produce a similar effect. Those combinations always fail to uphold wages at an artificial rate unless they also {{limit the number of}} competitors. Putting aside the atrocities sometimes committed by workmen in the way of personal outrage or intimidation, which can not be too rigidly repressed, if the present state of the general habits of the people were to remain forever unimproved, these partial combinations, in so far as they do succeed in keeping up the wages of any trade by limiting its numbers, might be looked upon as simply intrenching round a particular spot against the inroads of over-population, and making the wages of the class depend upon their own rate of increase, instead of depending on that of a more reckless and improvident class than themselves.|$|E

40|$|The Erdélyi Fiatalok (Transylvanian Youth), a {{group of}} young Hungarian intellectuals in Transylvania, {{undertook}} in the 1930 s “to know” the Hungarian village. They did so in order to know themselves better as Hungarians because they were convinced that the essential qualities of the “race” had been preserved in their purest form in the village, far removed from the cosmopolitan, modern city. Just as urgent, in their minds, was the need to establish close links between the intellectuals and the rural population, if the Hungarian community in Transylvania was to survive. Their way of achieving their goals was to carry out the systematic investigation of village life in all its diverse aspects and to base their work on up-to-date sociological theory and research methods. While drawing on the experience of their Hungarian colleagues elsewhere, they were perhaps most indebted to the ideas and practices developed by the sociological school of Bucharest, headed by Dimitrie Gusti, professor of sociology at the University. Gusti and his team of researchers welcomed the participation of the Transylvanian Hungarians in their work, and the resulting <b>common</b> <b>labors</b> offered an encouraging example of Romanian-Hungarian cooperation. In the end, the initiatives of the Erdélyi Fiatalok were thwarted by events beyond their control and perhaps by their own idealism...|$|R
