40|$|We have {{obtained}} H_α fluxes and luminosities for {{a sample of}} 95 accordant galaxies from observations of 31 Hickson Compact Groups (HCGs) in the North hemisphere. This sample is the largest H_α selected catalogue of galaxies having H_α <b>calibrated</b> <b>fluxes</b> so far. The results obtained from a preliminary analysis of a subsample of 66 galaxies show that the H_α luminosity of galaxies is correlated with velocity dispersion and compactness of groups. Such correlations would point toward a scenario in which H_α brightest galaxies reside in compact groups having higher probability of galaxy interaction i. e. lower values of velocity dispersion. Moreover such relations seem {{to depend on the}} environment in which HCGs themselves are embedded.

40|$|Abstract. Deep {{narrow band}} {{interference}} lters observa-tions are presented for 7 type I galactic planetary nebu-lae (PNe). Except for the nearly circular planetary neb-ula A 39, the observations show overall dimensions appre-ciably {{larger than those}} quoted so far. The observed PN (NGC 6302 excepted) could have linear diameters larger than 1 pc. Our new observations imply ionized masses of-ten larger than 1 M, suggesting {{that much of the}} mass ejected by the PN precursor is contained in faint outer extensions. This might contribute to the solution of the decit " in PNe. We have also provided <b>calibrated</b> <b>fluxes</b> for some specic emission lines.

We construct luminosity functions (LFs) for the complete sample, separately for arm and interarm regions, and for H II regions {{within and outside the}} limiting radius corresponding to the bright optical disk.

LFs for H II regions in the arms, in the interarm regions, in the inner part, and in the outer part of the galaxy all have the same slopes. We show and discuss the diameter distribution of the H II regions, both for the complete sample and for the separate arm, interarm, inner, and outer disk samples. There is no evidence for a different population of H II regions in the spiral arms, nor is there evidence for the existence of a significant population of density-bounded H II regions.

The flux of methane {{from the soil}} is calculated by two methods: a) Direct by placing a static open chamber at the soil surface, b) Indirect, using the ZZ 2 Rn concentrations profile and the 222 Rn flux in the soil surface in parallel with the methane concentration (222 Rn <b>calibrated</b> <b>fluxes).</b> The methane flux has been determined in two kinds of soils (sandy and loamy) in the surroundings of MJilaga (SPAIN).

Our method uses large-field-CCD images and long-slit spectra, and is part of the ongoing Beijing-Arizona-Taipei-Connecticut Sky Survey. The CCD images are taken with the NAOC 0. 6 / 0. 9 m f/ 3 Schmidt telescope at the Xinglong Observing Station, using a multicolor filter set. Spectra of 10 of the brightest HII regions are obtained using the NAOC 2. 16 m telescope with a Tek 1024 X 1024 CCD. The continua of the spectra are calibrated by flux-calibrated images taken from the Schmidt observations. We determine the continuum component of our H-alpha + [NII] image via interpolation from the more accurately-measured backgrounds (M 81 starlight) obtained from the two neighboring (in wavelength) BATC filter images. We use the <b>calibrated</b> <b>fluxes</b> of H-alpha + [NII] emission from the spectra to normalize this interpolated, continuum-subtracted H-alpha + [NII] image.

40|$|Efforts were {{concentrated}} on the spectral resolution of the Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL). This year's work was targeted towards the analysis of calibration techniques to enable the AOL to measure absolute radiances of both passive and active modes of operation. Absolute spectral calibration of the AOL is {{necessary in order to}} fully understand and monitor the sensitivity and stability of the total system. Calibration is also needed to obtain valid surface truth data, with which to improve the accuracy of satellite-borne oceanic color scanners. In particular, accurate measurements of oceanic chlorophyll concentrations rests upon reliable irradiance calibrations of both laser induced and solar induced chlorophyll fluoresence. An analysis was performed on the spectral calibration methods used by the AOL. The optical path of the instrumentation was examined to study how the radiance from a calibration sphere was influenced. Ray tracing analysis was performed, including the Cassegrain-telescope optics. It was determined that the calibration radiance was significantly effected by optical-defocusing, due to close positioning of the calibration sphere with respect to the telescope.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is the study of}} the {{exchange}} processes at atmosphere/biosphere interface, with a particular focus on momentum and heat transport over complex terrain morphology, varying surface roughness, and a wide range of atmospheric thermal conditions. The surface roughness object of the research is a sparse canopy layer evolving in time along the vegetative season, and characterized by a multiplicity of temporal and spatial scales influencing the properties of the turbulent fluxes. Both experimental and modelling approaches characterize the study methodology. Measurements are first performed in laboratory in order to <b>calibrate</b> <b>flux</b> sensors (i. e., ultrasonic anemometers), and subsequently into three N-W Italy vineyards fields, collecting long term turbulent flux observations over the canopy. Bulk and higher order statistics are explored from these dataset to investigate the turbulent properties of the momentum and heat transfer processes. The analysis is carried out using a conventional quadrant analysis technique and is tested against two models approximating the joint probability density function of the flow variables. Because of direct measurements at field scale are too costly and time consuming, the need to more easily measured parameters for applications in the meteorological and agricultural fields has motivated the examination of a land-surface model, by performing a validation against vineyard data and a sensitivity analysis on canopy parameters. The overall results suggest an improvement procedure for the estimation of turbulent heat flux using sonic anemometers, an insight on the perturbing effect of coherent structures on gradient-diffusion theory, and the key role of canopy parameterizations in the applicative model...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} has demonstrated that a small, remotely operated radio telescope can perform well enough to monitor blazar radio variability over periods of months to years. Such observations are not possible using premier telescope facilities, given observing time demands, and they enable scintillation effects intrinsic to the source to be disentangled from scintillation due to scattering of radio waves by the interstellar medium. This exercise provides insight into the nature of the source, and also provides a probe of turbulence in the interstellar medium. The University of Tasmania’s 30 m antenna near Ceduna in South Australia was converted to a radio telescope facility in 1997 from its former use as an Earth station. The COntinuous Single dish Monitoring of Intraday variables at Ceduna (COSMIC) campaign started in March 2003, and extended to early 2005. It observed a number of blazars, with the telescope remotely operated from Tasmania. The blazars were divided into groups lying south and north of the zenith at Ceduna, with each group served by a calibrator source and observed in turn for periods of 10 - 15 days.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{one particular}} {{issue that the}} authors came across when developing a DC Motor Duty Meter - a comprehensive condition monitoring tool for large DC motors based on flux density measurement inside the motor air gap. This particular issue crucial for the project was how to calibrate, with high accuracy, {{a large number of}} flux density sensors to be used to measure the flux density distribution along the surface of the motor poles. From available literature and IEEE standards, the recommended and most common way to generate a calibration magnetic field is based on Helmholtz coil principle, which in practice is limited to small flux density magnitudes. A method used by the authors and described in this paper utilizes a step test and simple calculations based on Faraday's Law. The novelty of the described method is in particularities of the system, measurements and calculations, which make the method highly immune to typical sources of errors. The method can be used to produce a very accurate and uniform magnetic field with densities ranging from fractions of Tesla to above one Tesla to <b>calibrate</b> <b>flux</b> sensors in this flux range.

40|$|The impact {{cratering}} {{record of}} the Moon and the terrestrial planets provides important clues about the formation and evolution of the Solar System. Especially intriguing is the epoch 3. 8 - 3. 9 Gyr ago (Ga), known as the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB), when the youngest lunar basins such as Imbrium and Orientale formed. The LHB was suggested to originate from a slowly declining impactor flux or from a late dynamical instability. Here we develop {{a model for the}} historical flux of large asteroid impacts and discuss how it depends on various parameters, including the time and nature of the planetary migration/instability. We find that the asteroid impact flux dropped by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude during the first 1 Gyr and remained relatively unchanged over the last 3 Gyr. The early impacts were produced by asteroids whose orbits became excited during the planetary migration/instability, and by those originating from the inner extension of the main belt (E-belt; semimajor axis 1. 6 <a< 2. 1 au). The profiles obtained for the early and late versions of the planetary instability initially differ, but end up being similar after ~ 3 Ga. Thus, the time of the instability can only be determined by considering the cratering and other constraints during the first ~ 1. 5 Gyr of the Solar System history. Our absolute calibration of the impact flux indicates that asteroids were probably not responsible for the LHB, independently of whether the instability happened early or late, because the <b>calibrated</b> <b>flux</b> is not large enough to explain Imbrium/Orientale and a significant share of large lunar craters. Comets and leftovers of the terrestrial planet formation provided additional, and probably dominant source of impacts during early epochs. Comment: The Astronomical Journal, in pres...|$|R
40|$|Stellar {{population}} {{models of}} absorption line indices {{are an important}} tool {{for the analysis of}} stellar population spectra. They are most accurately modelled through empirical calibrations of absorption line indices with the stellar parameters effective temperature, metallicity, and surface gravity, the so-called fitting functions. Here we present new empirical fitting functions for the 25 optical Lick absorption line indices based on the new stellar library MILES. The major improvements with respect to the Lick/IDS library are the better sampling of stellar parameter space, a generally higher signal- to-noise, and a careful flux calibration. In fact we find that errors on individual index measurements in MILES are considerably smaller than in Lick/IDS. Instead we find the rms of the residuals between the final fitting functions and the data to be dominated by errors in the stellar parameters. We provide fitting functions for both Lick/IDS and MILES spectral resolutions, and compare our results with other fitting functions in the literature. A Fortran 90 code is available online in order to simplify the implementation in stellar population models. We further calculate the offsets in index measurements between the Lick/IDS system to a <b>flux</b> <b>calibrated</b> system. For this purpose we use the three libraries MILES, ELODIE, and STELIB. We find that offsets are negligible in some cases, most notably for the widely used indices Hbeta, Mgb, Fe 5270, and Fe 5335. In a number of cases, however, the difference between <b>flux</b> <b>calibrated</b> library and Lick/IDS is significant with the offsets depending on index strengths. Interestingly, there is no general agreement between the three libraries for a large number of indices, which hampers the derivation of a universal offset between the Lick/IDS and <b>flux</b> <b>calibrated</b> systems.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new method to <b>calibrate</b> the relative <b>flux</b> levels in spectra from the HIRES echelle spectrograph on the Keck-I telescope. Standard data reduction techniques that transfer the instrument response between HIRES integrations leave {{errors in the}} flux of 5 – 10 %, because the effective response varies. The flux errors are most severe near the ends of each spectral order, where there can be discontinuous jumps. The source of these errors in uncertain, but may include changes in the vignetting connected to the optical alignment. Our new flux calibration method uses a calibrated reference spectrum of each target to calibrate individual HIRES integrations. We determine the instrument response independently for each integration, and hence we avoid the need to transfer the instrument response between HIRES integrations. The procedure {{can be applied to}} any HIRES spectrum, or any other spectrum.

It is designed to obtain 1 % RMS <b>flux</b> <b>calibrated</b> low resolution spectra in the wavelength range 370 – 960 [*]nm with signal-to-noise ratios > 100 for stars with V< 10 in short integration times of ∼ 1 minute. The strategy to calibrate the system using A-type stars is outlined. PHASES will make possible a complete characterization of stars, some of them hosting planets. From the comparison of observed spectra with accurate model atmospheres stellar angular diameters will be determined with precisions of ∼ 0. 5 %. The light curves of transiting systems will be then used to extract the radius of the planet with similar precision. The demanding scientific requirements to be achieved under extreme observing conditions have shaped the optomechanical design. A computational model and a high-precision interferometric system have been developed to test the performance of the instrument...|$|R
40|$|While the {{near-infrared}} wavelength {{regime is}} becoming more and more important for astrophysics there are few spectrophotometric standard star data available to <b>flux</b> <b>calibrate</b> such data. On the other hand <b>flux</b> <b>calibrating</b> high-resolution spectra is a challenge even in the optical wavelength range, because the available flux standard data are often too coarsely sampled. We describe a method to obtain reference spectra derived from stellar model atmospheres, which allow users to derive response curves from 300 nm to 2500 nm also for high-resolution spectra. We verified that they provide an appropriate description of the observed standard star spectra by checking for residuals in line cores and line overlap regions in the ratios of observed spectra to model spectra. The finally selected model spectra are then empirically corrected for remaining mismatches and photometrically calibrated using independent observations. In addition we have defined an automatic method to correct for moderate telluric absorption using telluric model spectra with very high spectral resolution, that can easily be adapted to the observed data. This procedure eliminates the need to observe telluric standard stars, as long as some knowledge on the target spectrum exists...|$|R
40|$|In principle, the MID-infrared Interferometric {{instrument}} (MIDI) at the Very Large Telescope Array (VLTI) {{should always}} measure the same <b>calibrated</b> total <b>flux</b> spectrum {{for a specific}} source, independent of the instrument settings and the baseline geometry. In the data on the Circinus galaxy, however, there is (a) a general offset of the flux values for 2009 and (b) a slow drift of the total fluxes at short wavelengths during two nights (2008 - 04 - 17 and 2009 - 04 - 14). The latter seems {{to depend on the}} hour angle of the observation. In this document, a more detailed analysis of these two effects is carried out and summarised. The goal is to find an explanation for these variations in the photometry. Comment: 15 pages, 17 figures and 3 tables (original version from Oct. 2009...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We present high {{signal-to-noise}} ratio Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph observations of 17 Virgo early-type galaxies.

To <b>flux</b> <b>calibrate</b> these extended sources, we have devised a new procedure that allows us to obtain the intrinsic spectral energy distribution and to disentangle resolved and unresolved emission within the same object. We have found that 13 objects of the sample (76...|$|R
