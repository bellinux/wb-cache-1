5|$|Evolves environments {{are based}} on Earth's as the design team {{wanted to create a}} world that felt {{believable}} for players and had regions that made geological sense after an early concept design was found to be too extreme. As a result, the design team drew inspiration from real-world landscapes. The design team wanted Evolve to be set in lush forests so that Hunters and Monsters could hide from each other. The design team tried using the Source game engine to create a forest landscape but they ultimately failed. The design team then researched Crytek's CryEngine, which powers games like Far <b>Cry</b> <b>and</b> Crysis. As the design team felt that Far <b>Cry</b> <b>and</b> Crysis set new standards for in-game environments, they decided to utilize CryEngine for Evolve. Evolves maps were designed to be dark and mysterious, so that the various characters can hide from each other, as well as presenting a sense of surprise when players are ambushed.|$|E

He parts with the widows and {{continues}} homeward, thinking that his story troubled Lukerya and made Vasilisa weep not because he told it well but because the tale was relevant to them nineteen centuries later. As he rides the ferry to his village, Ivan comes to believe that truth and beauty serve as the connectors of all human history and he is filled with joy and awe at life itself.|$|E

5|$|As the town, where Hamasaki {{is sitting}} on the bench, starts to rain, the {{atmosphere}} where Hamasaki is the doll starts to rain as well. Just after Hamasaki finishes singing the second chorus, an instrumental break happens and has Hamasaki looking at the now abandoned puppet show. A truck then drives past, which vibrates the puppet show's stage, causing the doll to fall on the ground and its strings become tangled. This happens to Hamasaki as the doll; she faints in the dark atmosphere land, with strings attached to her. Hamasaki, sitting on the bench, starts to <b>cry</b> <b>and</b> sings the remaining of the song. It ends with the taxi driver, who finishes day dreaming about the marionettes dolls, opening the door for Hamasaki to enter.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old. Females enter oestrus (typically five days long) from January to March. In males, {{spermatogenesis}} occurs mainly in February and March. In southern Turkmenistan, mating occurs from January to early February. The mating season is marked by noisy fights among males for dominance. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Vocalisations and flehmen are prominent during courtship. After a successful copulation, the female gives out a loud <b>cry</b> <b>and</b> reacts with aversion towards her partner. The pair then separate.|$|E
5|$|Back at home, Grampa babysits Bart and Lisa, who trick their {{grandfather}} into letting them throw their own party. At the lake the next morning, Homer tries to sneak away to go fishing, but Marge wakes up first. Marge is upset that Homer would choose fishing over their marriage, which Homer fails to understand as he visualizes Marge {{turning into a}} catfish. Homer takes a walk instead of returning to bed. On the dock, he finds an abandoned fishing pole. The pole, with General Sherman on the line, yanks him off the pier into a small rowboat, and onto the lake. From their cabin window, Marge watches Homer battle General Sherman and gets frustrated. At home, Bart and Lisa's party has ended and {{the house is a}} total mess.

40|$|Infant {{excessive}} <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> fussing {{has been}} linked to adverse maternal outcomes such as increased depression and stress, and decreased feelings of parenting self-efficacy. Infant crying has also been identified as the number one trigger caregivers report prior to an abusive action, placing infants who cry excessively at risk. Fathers and male caregivers have been identified as the primary offenders in the majority of infant abuse cases, suggesting a particular risk between fathers <b>and</b> infants who <b>cry</b> excessively. However, the relationship between excessive <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> fathers has not been explored to the same extent as mothers. In an effort to address the identified risks of infant <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> fathers, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate how fathers 2 ̆ 7 well-being is impacted by infant <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> fussing.

One hundred and ninety-two fathers of infants under one year of age completed online measures of depression (EPDS), parenting stress (PSI/SF), parenting self-efficacy (MSE), and coping (RWCC). Fathers reported amount of infant crying (categorized adhering to Wessel 2 ̆ 7 s Rule of Three for colic criteria) as well as concern about their infant 2 ̆ 7 s <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> fussing. Ten fathers participated in a semi-structured phone interview about the experience of and coping with infant <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> parenting in general.

5|$|For {{several years}} both Colla Ciotach and the Macfie chief lived on Colonsay, with Colla Ciotach {{residing}} at Kiloran and Macfie at Dùn Eibhinn. During {{this time the}} two feuded. Judging by the many hiding places which bear his name, such as leab' fhalaich Mhic a Phì ("MacPhee's Hiding Place"), Macfie was chased {{from one to another}} for quite sometime. Finally, in 1623, Malcolm Macfie was chased from Colonsay and pursued to Eilean nan Ròn (south-west of Oronsay). There, on the south-western corner of Eilean nan Ròn, called an t Eilean Iarach, he was spotted and taken by the MacDonalds. Popular lore has it that the Macfie chief was finally discovered when his hiding place amongst the seaweed was given away by a gull. As it hovered over Macfie's position, Colla Ciotach's men were alerted by its <b>cry</b> <b>and</b> spotted the clan chief on a ledge of rock {{at the edge of the}} sea. After being apprehended, the chief was then tied to a stone and summarily shot. Colla Ciotach, and several of his followers, appear in the Council Records in 1623 as being accused of killing the Macfie chief. Because of the death of their chief the Macfies finally lost control of Colonsay. The island then passed to the Macdonalds, as Colla Ciotach took the island for himself, and held it peacefully for many years.|$|E
5|$|Kelly {{admits to}} some problems, while making excuses for her boyfriend, {{such as his}} busy {{schedule}} and her own moodiness. Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to <b>cry</b> <b>and</b> laugh at the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) teaches Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{about his}} {{favorite}} movie, Die Hard, {{and attempts to}} recite all the dialogue from memory while an impressed Erin checks his accuracy using an online transcript. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and {{says that he is}} going to stay for a few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die Hard with Pete rather than just hear him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to <b>cry</b> <b>and</b> Pete tries to comfort her by placing his arm around her. In the meantime, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) about the Scranton Strangler case he was on.

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dorothy appears naked outside was {{inspired}} by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood when he and his brother saw a naked woman walking down a neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him <b>cry,</b> <b>and</b> he had never forgotten it. Principal photography of Blue Velvet began in February 1986 and completed in April. The film was shot at EUE/Screen Gems studio in Wilmington, North Carolina, which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to <b>cry</b> <b>and</b> clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

25|$|As {{previously}} stated, the C-Terminal {{domain of}} casein kinase 1 epsilon behaves as a pseudosubstrate when phosphorylated, inhibiting kinase activity. The C-Terminal domain {{has also been}} shown to be dephosphorylated by phosphatases such as Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in vitro and cell culture, which regulates levels of active casein kinase in vivo. Current theory of circadian rhythms hypothesizes that this phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of casein kinase 1 epsilon is important in modulation of the period of circadian rhythms in the cell, with increased phosphorylation decreasing casein kinase 1 epsilon activity (and subsequently increasing active <b>CRY</b> <b>and</b> PER) and dephosphorylation of casein kinase 1 epsilon resulting in a more active kinase (and lower levels of active <b>CRY</b> <b>and</b> PER).|$|E

40|$|Thirteen of {{the most}} common lepidopteran-specific Cry {{proteins}} of Bacillus thuringiensis have been tested for their efficacy against newly hatched larvae of two populations of the spiny bollworm, Earias insulana. At a concentration of 100 μg of toxin per milliliter of artificial diet, six Cry toxins (Cry 1 Ca, Cry 1 Ea, Cry 1 Fa, Cry 1 Ja, <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 Ab) were not toxic at all. Cry 1 Aa, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ja, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa did not cause mortality but caused significant inhibition of growth. The other Cry toxins (Cry 1 Ab, Cry 1 Ac, Cry 1 Ba, Cry 1 Da, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca) were toxic to E. insulana larvae. The 50 % lethal concentration values of these toxins ranged from 0. 39 to 21. 13 μg/ml (for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, respectively) for an E. insulana laboratory colony originating from Egypt and from 0. 20 to 4. 25 μg/ml (for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Da, respectively) for a laboratory colony originating from Spain. The relative potencies of the toxins in the population from Egypt were highest for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, <b>and</b> they were both significantly more toxic than <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba, followed by <b>Cry</b> 1 Da <b>and</b> finally <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia. In the population from Spain, Cry 9 Ca was the most toxic, followed in decreasing order by <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba, <b>and</b> the least toxic was Cry 1 Da. Binding experiments were performed to test whether the toxic Cry proteins shared binding sites in this insect. 125 I-labeled <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab <b>and</b> biotinylated <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca showed specific binding to the brush border membrane vesicles from E. insulana. Competition binding experiments among these toxins showed that only <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac competed for the same binding sites, indicating a high possibility that this insect may develop cross-resistance to Cry 1 Ab upon exposure to Cry 1 Ac transgenic cotton but not to the other toxins tested...|$|R
