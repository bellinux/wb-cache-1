2500|$|In 2010, a {{published}} report described the likely {{mechanism of action}} underlying not only the cases of liver failure but also cases of visual disturbances and exacerbations of myasthenia gravis. [...] The study showed that a pyridine moiety {{that is part of}} the telithromycin molecule acts as an antagonist on cholinergic receptors located in the neuromuscular junction, the <b>ciliary</b> <b>ganglion</b> of the eye and the vagus nerve innervating the liver. [...] Other macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin and the fluoroketolide, solithromycin, do not contain the pyridine [...] moiety and do not antagonize these cholinergic receptors significantly.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{different}} types of near response are caused by different underlying disease processes. [...] Adie's pupil is caused by damage to peripheral pathways to the pupil (parasympathetic neurons in the <b>ciliary</b> <b>ganglion</b> that cause pupillary constriction to bright light and with near vision). The pathophysiologic mechanism which produces an Argyll Robertson pupil is unclear, but {{is believed to be the}} result of bilateral damage to the pretectal nuclei in the midbrain. Studies have failed to demonstrate a focal localising lesion. Research has implicated the rostral midbrain in the vicinity of the cerebral aqueduct of the third ventricle as the most likely region of damage. A lesion in this area would involve efferent pupillary fibres on the dorsal aspect of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (associated with the response to light) while sparing the fibres associated with the response to near, which lie slightly more ventrally.|$|E
40|$|Cytosine arabinoside (ARA C), a {{competitive}} inhibitor of {{the incorporation of}} P’-deoxycytidine into DNA in other cell types, caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of KCI- and insulin-stimulated survival of postmitotic <b>ciliary</b> parasympathetic <b>ganglion</b> neurons, and the nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulated survival of postmitotic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons in vitro. The IC,, for survival was 2 x 1 O- 8 M for both types of neurons after 4 d under the culture conditions used. The inhibition of DRG survival by ARA C {{in the presence of}} varying concentrations of NGF indicated that ARA C acted as an apparent noncompetitive antagonist of NGF. This cytotoxic effect of ARA C was blocked by 2 ’deoxycytidine, but not by cytosine, 2 ’-deoxyadenosine, 2 ’deoxyguanosine, or 2 ’-deoxythymine, indicating that ARA C was interfering with a deoxycytidine-specific survival process...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the distribution of}} platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor in the rat eye. Methods. Platelet-activating factor receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was evaluated with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in RNAs from several rat ocular tissues. Distribution of the expression was determined with in situ hybridization in adult rat eye sections and a 35 S-labeled complementary RNA probe synthesized from the rat PAF receptor complementary DNA. In situ hybridization was also done witfi sections immunostained witfi OX- 42, a microglia marker. Results. RT-PCR revealed that levels of PAF receptor expression were similar among the ocular tissues studied. The in situ hybridization signals {{were found in the}} corneal epithelium, iris and <b>ciliary</b> body, and <b>ganglion</b> and microglial cells in the retina. Conclusions. Platelet-activating factor receptor mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in the rat eye with relative concentration in the corneal epithelium, iris and ciliary body, and retinal ganglion and microglial cells.

30|$|The International Headache Society {{recently}} defined strict {{clinical criteria}} for trigeminal neuralgia (TN) diagnosis (Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society 2013). Diagnosis of TN consists {{at least three}} attacks of unilateral facial pain occur fulfilling these criteria; (1) occurring {{in one or more}} trigeminal nerve division, (2) pain with at least three of the following four characteristics that are recurring paroxysmal attacks lasting from {{a fraction of a second}} to 2  min, severe intensity, electric shock-like shooting–stabbing or sharp in quality and precipitated by innocuous stimuli to the affected side of the face. In this new classification it has been proposed to differentiate TN into two types; type 1 (previously referred to as classic or typical TN), which is an idiopathic episodic pain with the previously reported clinical characteristics, lasting several seconds, with pain-free intervals between attacks and type 2, describing idiopathic trigeminal facial pain that is aching, throbbing, or burning pain for more than  % 50 of the time and is constant in nature with a minor component of sharp, episodic pain. It has been also theorized that TN type 1 can progress toward TN type 2 and that in this second type, the likehood of detecting a structural abnormality such as a tumor or a vascular malformation is higher (Eller et al. 2005). Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) may be involved in persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP) and unilateral headaches (Eller et al. 2005; Montano et al. 2015). A few motor nerves accompany the SPG sensory trunks. An irritation of the SPG motor root may; produce face and neck neuralgias by its connection with the facial nerve (FN), lesser occipital and cutaneous cervical nerves; account for disturbances in the eye and mandible region by its connections with the <b>ciliary</b> and otic <b>ganglions</b> and a variety of visceral symptoms by its connection with the vagus nerve; cause reflex otalgia by its connection with the tympanic plexus (Capra and Dessem 1992; Maarbjerg et al. 2014).|$|R

50|$|The {{sympathetic}} root of <b>ciliary</b> <b>ganglion</b> is one {{of three}} roots of the <b>ciliary</b> <b>ganglion,</b> a tissue mass behind the eye. It contains postganglionic sympathetic fibers whose cell bodies are located in the superior cervical ganglion. Their axons ascend with the internal carotid artery as a plexus of nerves, the carotid plexus. Sympathetic fibers innervating the eye separate from the carotid plexus within the cavernous sinus. They run forward through the superior orbital fissure and merge with the long ciliary nerves (branches of the nasociliary nerve) and the short ciliary nerves (from the <b>ciliary</b> <b>ganglion).</b> Sympathetic fibers in the short ciliary nerves pass through the <b>ciliary</b> <b>ganglion</b> without forming synapses.|$|E
50|$|The nerve also {{includes}} axons of type GVE, general visceral efferent, which provide preganglionic parasympathetics to the <b>ciliary</b> <b>ganglion.</b> From the <b>ciliary</b> <b>ganglion</b> post ganglionic fibers {{pass through the}} short ciliary nerve to the constrictor pupillae of the iris and the cilliary muscles.|$|E

Parasympathetic activation of the M3 muscarinic receptors causes ciliary muscle contraction, the effect of contraction is to decrease {{the diameter of the}} ring of ciliary muscle.

5000|$|The strange {{behavior}} of tonic pupils was first explained by Irene Loewenfeld in 1979.
