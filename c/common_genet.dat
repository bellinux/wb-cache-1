25|$|The Eastern Desert has a quite {{different}} range of fauna and has {{much in common with}} the Sinai Peninsula, showing the importance of the broad Nile in separating the two desert regions. Here are found the striped hyena, Nubian ibex, bushy-tailed jird, golden spiny mouse, Blanford's fox and Rüppell's fox. The sand partridge, streaked scrub warbler, mourning wheatear and white-crowned wheatear are typical of this region. The high rocky mountains of Gebel Elba in the south have a distinctive range of animals including the aardwolf, striped polecat, and <b>common</b> <b>genet,</b> and there may still be African wild ass in this area.|$|E
500|$|This species {{lives in}} small groups and is very shy, often {{remaining}} in dense vegetation to avoid detection, and therefore its ecology is very little studied. It is believed that the francolin may migrate from lower altitudes to higher altitudes and juniper forest in the warmer months. Its main predator is the <b>common</b> <b>genet.</b> The bird is most active and most likely to call between 6am and 9am. After this it may {{spend most of the}} day perched motionless in a tree up to [...] above the ground. It eats berries, seeds, termites and figs. It scratches the ground to collect seeds and, when it finds an area disturbed by warthogs, also scratches the ground for termites. It is monogamous and breeds between December and February.|$|E

50|$|In Spain, <b>common</b> <b>genets</b> breed between January and September, with a peak in February and March {{and another}} one in the summer. Mating {{behaviour}} and development of young has been studied in captive individuals. Copulation lasts about two to three minutes, and is repeated up to five times in the same night. After a gestation period of 10 to 11 weeks, up to four young are born. Newborn <b>common</b> <b>genets</b> weigh 60 to 85 g. They start eating meat at around seven weeks of age, and are fully weaned at four months of age. When five months old, they are skilled in hunting on their own.

Since 1998 the range also has a photovoltaic plant that powers its facilities.|$|E
50|$|Both {{male and}} females scent mark {{in their home}} ranges. Females mark their {{territory}} using scent glands on their flanks, hind legs, and perineum. Males mark less frequently than females, often spraying urine, rather than using their scent glands, and do so primarily during the breeding season. Scent marks by both sexes allow individuals to identify the reproductive and social status of other <b>genets.</b> <b>Common</b> <b>genets</b> also defecate at specific latrine sites, which are often located {{at the edge of}} their territories, and perform a similar function to other scent marks.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 15 immobilizations were {{performed}} on 12 <b>common</b> <b>genets</b> (Genetta ge­ netta) {{with a combination of}} ketamine hydro­ chloride (KE) and xylazine hydrochloride (XY).

40|$|Although tree hollows {{seem to be}} key {{structures}} {{for a wide range}} of forest mammals, their importance for Mediterranean forest carnivores remain poorly understood. Here we address this issue, by analysing daily resting site use by 21 radio-collared <b>common</b> <b>genets.</b> Tree hollows were used far more frequently during the wet season (October–April; 73. 1 % of daily locations) than in the dry season (May–September; 47. 6 %). Nests and underground dens were the second and third most frequently used resting sites, respectively, in both wet (17. 5 % and 9. 4 %) and dry (34. 1 % and 18. 3 %) seasons. Each individual reused a large percentage of its resting sites (65. 7 %). Some resting sites (17. 3 %) were used by more than one individual, but simultaneous sharing was exceedingly rare (0. 56 % of daily locations). Hollow use probability during the wet season varied little in relation to environmental variables, though there was a tendency to be higher away from riparian habitats (> 50 m) and to be lower in sites with very high shrub cover (> 80 %). Environmental influences were responsible for more variability in the dry season, when hollow usage was highest in hot days, in days with precipitation, far from riparian habitats, close to sources of human disturbance, in landscapes dominated by continuous forest habitats, and in sites with low shrub cover. Results support the importance of tree hollows for Mediterranean forest carnivores, probably because they provide safe shelter against unfavourable weather, predators and human disturbance. However, results also revealed the importance of riparian trees, which offer support for building nests close to sources of water and food during the dry season. Considering home range size and the average number of hollow-bearing trees used by each genet, we recommend that management of cork and holm oak forests should strive to safeguard at least 4. 6 hollow-bearing trees per 100 ha, while simultaneously maintaining large riparian trees. This will improve the resting habitat for <b>common</b> <b>genets,</b> while presumably favouring also other Mediterranean carnivores...|$|R
40|$|Many {{species that}} occur at low densities are not {{accurately}} estimated using capture–recapture methods as such techniques assume that populations are well–defined in space. To solve this bias, spatially explicit capture–recapture (SECR) models {{have recently been}} developed.

In this study, we used data from camera–trap surveys of <b>common</b> <b>genets</b> (Genetta genetta) in Serra da Malcata (Portugal), designed to compare abundance estimates produced by SECR models with traditional closed–capture models. Using the SECR models, we observed spatial heterogeneity in genet distribution and density estimates were approximately two times lower than those obtained from the closed population models. The non–spatial model estimates were constrained to sampling grid size and likely underestimated movements, thereby overestimating density.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 11 th International Mammalogical Congress, celebrado en Belfast (Irlanda) del 11 al 16 de agosto de 2013. Camera {{trapping}} methods {{provide valuable}} tools for monitoring carnivore communities, but detection rates are usually low due to these species low density. We assessed the detectability of Mediterranean carnivores by camera traps for several attractants in two study areas in Central Spain, analyzing the data with occupancy models. The combination of lynx urine (LU) and valerian extract (VE) provided {{for all the}} carnivore species higher detectability than any of these scents in isolation, increasing detectability between x 2 and x 7, depending on the species. The combination LU+VE produced higher detection probability for red foxes, Egyptian mongooses and Eurasian wildcats than a bait lure (raw chicken). However, raw chicken yielded a higher detectability for stone martens, <b>common</b> <b>genets</b> and Eurasian badgers. These results suggest valuable recommendations for new studies {{depending on whether the}} aim was to maximize the detectability of a particular species or to monitor the whole mesocarnivore community.
