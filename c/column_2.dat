40|$|We compare tropospheric <b>column</b> NO <b>2</b> {{between the}} UK Met Office {{operational}} Air Quality in the Unified Model (AQUM) and satellite observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) for 2006. <b>Column</b> NO <b>2</b> retrievals from satellite instruments {{are prone to}} large uncertainty from random, systematic and smoothing errors. We present an algorithm to reduce the random error of time-averaged observations, once smoothing errors have been removed with application of satellite averaging kernels to the model data. This reduces the total error in seasonal mean columns by 10 – 70 %, which allows critical evaluation of the model. The standard AQUM configuration evaluated here uses chemical lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) from the GEMS (Global and regional Earth-system Monitoring using Satellite and in situ data) reanalysis. In summer the standard AQUM overestimates <b>column</b> NO <b>2</b> in northern England and Scotland, but underestimates it over continental Europe. In winter, the model overestimates <b>column</b> NO <b>2</b> across the domain.

The sensitivity of AQUM summer <b>column</b> NO <b>2</b> to different chemical LBCs and NO x emissions data sets are investigated. Using Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) LBCs increases AQUM O 3 concentrations compared with the default GEMS LBCs.
