5|$|A <b>cytotoxic</b> agent can {{be linked}} to an anti-tumor {{antibody}} for drug targeting purposes. The word vedotin, for example, stands for monomethyl auristatin E which is toxic by itself but predominantly affects cancer cells if used in conjugates like glembatumumab vedotin.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, during wake periods {{differentiated}} effector cells, such as <b>cytotoxic</b> natural killer {{cells and}} CTLs (<b>cytotoxic</b> T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak. There are two theories {{as to why the}} pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin. Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of therapeutic antibodies {{for the treatment}} of patients with colorectal cancer has garnered well-deserved attention and excitement. 1 - 4 However, it is notable that traditional <b>cytotoxics</b> remain the backbone of systemic therapy for this disease. The benefits of both bevacizumab and cetuximab are augmented by concurrent administration of chemotherapy. 2, 3 In fact, both of these targeted therapeutics may be appropriately viewed as chemotherapy sensitizers. Therefore, efforts to refine understanding and optimize the clinical use of available <b>cytotoxics</b> remain important. In this issue, Goldberg et al 5 report outcomes for a subset of patients enrolled onto North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial 9741, a North American intergroup study of initial therapy for patients withmetastatic colorectal cancer.

40|$|The {{encapsulation}} of doxorubicin in a pegylated liposomal matrix {{led to a}} reformulated {{agent with}} a different toxicity profile and improved clinical utility. Liposomal doxorubicin is devoid of the cardiac toxicity associated with doxorubicin, but is associated with predictable muco-cutaneous toxicity. The liposomal formulation leads to improved delivery to the target tumor tissue, allowing enhanced uptake by cancer cells. These properties translate into clinical utility in recurrent ovarian cancer as demonstrated by phase II and III trials, this proven clinical efficacy leading to FDA approval in second-line therapy for ovarian cancer. New combinations with <b>cytotoxics,</b> in particular with carboplatin, have demonstrated an acceptable toxicity profile and clinical utility in platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. A favorable toxicity profile renders liposomal doxorubicin an ideal partner for combination regimens with other <b>cytotoxics,</b> and more recently with biological agents.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that Australia's {{population}} is ageing and that the incidence of cancer is highest in older age groups, so despite the fact that cancer incidence rates in Australia {{for both men and women}} are projected to remain stable to 2011, the total number of new cases of cancer is projected to increase. To reduce the resulting burden on the health care system it is imperative that patients be treated at home. The introduction of several new oral <b>cytotoxics,</b> allowing the administration of chemotherapeutic agents outside of traditional clinic settings, is making this goal attainable. While studies have shown that patients receiving chemotherapy prefer the oral route of administration over the parenteral route, there are many new challenges in administering these agents in non-traditional environments.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Production of {{high levels}} of IL- 6 is often {{correlated}} with resistance to <b>cytotoxics</b> or ionizing radiations, in cancer cell lines as in various cancer patients. We investigated whether monoclonal antibodies directed against IL- 6 may enable to reverse resistance of cancer cell lines. Methodology/Principal Findings: We exposed ten haematological cancer cells from lymphoma, myeloma or leukemia origins to <b>cytotoxics</b> or ionizing radiations and assessed the effects of anti-IL- 6 antibody addition on cell proliferation, apoptosis or IL- 6 signaling. A strong correlation between IL- 6 secretion, measured by ELISA, and resistance to doxorubicin as ionizing radiations was observed in the multiple myeloma U 266 and the Burkitt's lymphoma Daudi and Namalwa cells. Although an anti-IL- 6 antibody combined to both treatments efficiently blocked IL- 6 signaling in U 266 cells, expressing the IL- 6 receptor gp 80, it did not increase treatment-induced anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on these cells, {{as well as on}} Daudi and Namalwa cells. This lack of effect could be related to diverse factors: 1) a higher release of the soluble form of IL- 6 receptor gp 80 in response to doxorubicin and irradiation from all cell lines, 2) an impaired level of the IL- 6 pathway inhibitor SOCS 3 in Daudi cells, and 3) an increased release of IL- 10 and TNFα, two cytokines involved in cell radio- and chemoresistance.

5|$|Those {{cells that}} {{recognize}} coated pathogens have Fc receptors, which, {{as the name}} suggests, interact with the Fc region of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies. The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will phagocytose, mast cells and neutrophils will degranulate, natural killer cells will release cytokines and <b>cytotoxic</b> molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe. The activation of natural killer cells by antibodies initiates a <b>cytotoxic</b> mechanism known as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) – this process may explain the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies used in biological therapies against cancer. The Fc receptors are isotype-specific, which gives greater flexibility to the immune system, invoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens.|$|E

Eleven patients were completely protected from vomiting; 9 had mild to moderate nausea and vomiting, but none severe enough to require alternative anti-emetic 'rescue'. In 4 of the patients in whom BRL 43694 was delayed until 4 - 6 h after chemotherapy, vomiting had already begun; in each case immediate termination of vomiting occurred when BRL 43694 was infused. No adverse effects attributable to the anti-emetic were observed.
