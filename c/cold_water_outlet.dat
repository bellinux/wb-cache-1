40|$|There is {{evidence}} that drinking water may {{be a source of}} infections with pathogenic nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in humans. One method by which NTM are believed to enter drinking water distribution systems is by their intracellular colonization of protozoa. Our goal was to determine whether we could detect a reduction in the prevalence of NTM recovered from an unfiltered surface drinking water system after the addition of ozonation and filtration treatment and to characterize NTM isolates by using molecular methods. We sampled water from two initially unfiltered surface drinking water treatment plants over a 29 -month period. One plant received the addition of filtration and ozonation after 6 months of sampling. Sample sites included those at treatment plant effluents, distributed <b>water,</b> and <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> taps (point-of-use [POU] sites) in public or commercial buildings located within each distribution system. NTM were recovered from 27 % of the sites. POU sites yielded the majority of NTM, with > 50 % recovery despite the addition of ozonation and filtration. Closely related electrophoretic groups of Mycobacterium avium were found to persist at POU sites for up to 26 months. Water collected from POU <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>outlets</b> was persistently colonized with NTM despite the addition of ozonation and filtration to a drinking water system. This suggests that <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> POU <b>outlets</b> need to be considered as a potential source of chronic human exposure to NTM...|$|R

From the simple wheelie bin {{with water and}} ice, to the inflatable baths with complex water cooling units to recovery sessions in the ocean, the practice of <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> immersion is wide and varied. Research into <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> immersion was conducted as early as 1963 when Clarke 1 examined the influence of <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> on performance recovery after a sustained handgrip exercise.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> immersion on muscle oxygenation and performance during repeated bouts of fatiguing exercise in a group of healthy young adults. Twenty healthy subjects performed 2 fatiguing bouts of maximal dynamic knee extension and flexion contractions both concentrically on an isokinetic dynamometer with a 10 -min recovery period in between. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> immersion (treatment) or passive recovery (control) group. Changes in muscle oxygenation were monitored continuously using near-infrared spectroscopy. Muscle performance was measured with isokinetic dynamometry during each fatiguing bout. Skin temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle soreness ratings were also assessed. Repeated measures ANOVA analysis was used to evaluate treatment effects. The treatment group had a significantly lower mean heart rate and lower skin temperature compared to the control group (P < 0. 05). <b>Cold</b> <b>water</b> immersion attenuated a reduction in tissue oxygenation in the second fatiguing bout by 4 % when compared with control.
