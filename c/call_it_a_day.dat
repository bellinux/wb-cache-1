25|$|Slade {{returned}} to the UK in August 1976 to face the UK music business much changed from when they had left. Punk rock had now exploded and had become the dominant influence on youth culture and the music press. Despite Slade's {{reputation as one of}} the great high energy bands of their day, in this environment Slade had become irrelevant. Regardless, Slade were determined that they were now a better live act than ever and refused to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> The band began recording their seventh studio album in August. According to the Slade Fan Club, the band hoped to record a total of 16 tracks and pick the best to release on the album.|$|E

500|$|In 1937, deHavilland had {{her first}} top billing in Archie Mayo's comedy <b>Call</b> <b>It</b> <b>a</b> <b>Day,</b> about a middle-class English family {{struggling}} with the romantic effects of spring fever {{during the course of}} a single day. DeHavilland played daughter Catherine Hilton, who falls in love with the handsome artist hired to paint her portrait. The film did not do well at the box office and did little to advance her career. She fared better in Mayo's screwball comedy It's Love I'm After with Leslie Howard and Bette Davis. DeHavilland played Marcia West, a young debutante and theater fan enamored with a Barrymore-like matinee idol who decides to help the girl's fiancé by pretending to be an abominable cad. The film received good reviews, with Variety calling it [...] "fresh, clever, excellently directed and produced, and acted by an ensemble that clicks from start to finish", and praising deHavilland.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the family}} can <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> they arrive home and find Amber and Ginger waiting in their driveway. Amber shows Marge and the kids video footage of a drunk Homer marrying Amber in Vegas, while Ginger is next door with the widowed Ned Flanders. Homer tries to get his {{marriage}} to Amber annulled by the court, but Judge Constance Harm refuses, stating that Homer married Amber in Nevada and the marriage still stands, since Homer never officially divorced Amber. Marge is so angry that she banishes Homer, who takes up residence in Bart's treehouse with Amber. Homer still loves Marge and refuses to sleep with Amber, so he tries to sleep in Santa's Little Helper's kennel, but ends up getting its doorway stuck to his head and spends {{the rest of the}} night trying to get it off. The next day, Marge finds Homer asleep amid the broken remains of the doghouse, and she tells Homer that she is still angry at Homer over what he did, but she has a plan to get Amber out of their house.|$|E
500|$|Bridges left Brackley in {{the summer}} and signed for Northern Premier League side King's Lynn Town in May 2014. On {{securing}} the signing of Bridges for the season, manager Gary Setchell stated [...] "I’m probably very, very fortunate I’ve stumbled across Bridgo when he’s got a lot going on outside of football, business wise". Whilst out injured, and having already obtained his UEFA 'B' coaching badge, Bridges was made first-team coach at the club in February 2015. He combined the role alongside continuing to play in the first-team. King's Lynn were moved into the Southern Premier League for the 201516 campaign and Bridges continued to feature regularly in the Linnets midfield during the campaign, making 39 appearances in all competitions. Bridges retired from playing in May 2016 to [...] "concentrate on his successful business ventures and spend time with his family".

2500|$|The {{remaining}} members decided to continue, but their next album See Ya 'Round {{proved to be}} their last. It came out in November 1984 and was dominated by Neil Finn songs, [...] although Hester, now a permanent member, contributed one number. The first single from the album was Neil's stirring, bittersweet farewell to Tim and the Enz, [...] "I Walk Away" [...] which was released in September. It {{was followed by the}} darker [...] "One Mouth is Fed" [...] in November. By this time the group had finally decided to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> and they reunited with Tim and embarked on the rapturously received [...] "Enz with a Bang" [...] Australasian farewell tour in October/November 1984.

[...] Anderson also made a personal statement saying: [...] "There has been speculation about record sales and chart positions, but the bottom line is I need to do whatever it takes to get my demon back." [...] Suede's last concert at the London Astoria on 13 December 2003 was a two-and-a-half-hour marathon show, split into two parts plus encore. Anderson made an announcement, saying, [...] "I just want you to know. There will be another Suede record. But not yet." [...] Later, Osman would reveal that as they were walking to the studio set, Anderson whispered into his ear: [...] "Let's not do this anymore." ...|$|E

60|$|It seemed rummy to me, though, {{that the}} parcel of nice books {{was still there}} with the string and paper on it. It looked as if Motty, after seeing mother off at the station, had decided to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Some poets are whales at epics and {{all that}} sort of thing, while others <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> when they've written {{something}} that runs to a couple of verses, but where Tennyson had the bulge was that his long game was just as good as his short. He was great off the tee and a marvel with his chip-shots." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the bearded}} bloke had shot his bolt. He stood there, licked at last; and, {{watching}} him closely, I {{could see that}} he was now at the crossroads. I could spot what he was thinking as clearly as if he had confided it to my personal ear. He wanted to sit down and <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> I mean, but the thought that gave him pause was that, if he did, he must then either uncork Gussie or take the Fink-Nottle speech as read and get straight on to the actual prize-giving.|$|E

60|$|The {{only person}} who {{did not appear to}} be {{concerned}} was Ginger himself. He gathered up his loot, thrust it into his pocket, and elbowed his way to where Sally stood, now definitely established in the eyes of the crowd as a pariah. There was universal regret that he had decided to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> It was to the spectators as though a star had suddenly walked off the stage in the middle of his big scene; and not even a loud and violent quarrel which sprang up at this moment between two excitable gamblers over a disputed five-franc counter could wholly console them.|$|E

Any {{time you want to}} <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> and go off and watch a ball-game, {{all you have to do}} is to leave word that you have an urgent date to see Mr. Rockerfeller. Whereas I shall have to submerge myself in paper and only come up for air when the danger of suffocation becomes too great." ...|$|E
6000|$|The buzz-saw snarled {{and rattled}} {{in the yard}} [...] And made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood, [...] Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it.

[...] And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled, [...] As it ran light, or had to bear a load. [...] And nothing happened: day was all but done. [...] <b>Call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> I wish they might have said [...] To please the boy by giving him the half hour [...] That a boy counts so much when saved from work. [...] His sister stood beside them in her apron [...] To tell them [...] "Supper."

[...] "Don't let him cut my hand off-- [...] The doctor, when he comes. Don't let him, sister!" [...] So. But the hand was gone already. [...] The doctor put him in the dark of ether.

[...] Little--less--nothing!--and that ended it. [...] No more to build on there. And they, since they [...] Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs.|$|E
