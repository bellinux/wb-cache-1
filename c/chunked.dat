The first variant edition, dubbed the Red Pop edition, contains an album of cover songs entitled Smothered, Covered & <b>Chunked,</b> which features appearances by Psychopathic artists Twiztid, Anybody Killa, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Cold 187um and Boondox, as well as Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst and rapper Lil Wyte. The second variant, the Black Pop edition, contains the album Freaky Tales, consisting of a single, album-length rap, inspired by Too Short's song of the same name. The third variant, the White Pop edition, contains the remix album Mike E. Clark's Extra Pop Emporium, which features remixes, outtakes and leftover songs recorded during the Mighty Death Pop sessions; these tracks include appearances by Kottonmouth Kings, Three 6 Mafia, Color Me Badd, Ice Cube, Scarface, Geto Boys, Twiztid, Kreayshawn, Swollen Members and WillieD. ICP said in their December 21, 2012 Hatchet Herald edition {{that they will be}} releasing a sideshow EP for The Mighty Death Pop! in 2013. The EP is titled House Of Wax set to be released on November 25, 2014 packaged inside The First Six.|$|E

25|$|Another type of device {{people use}} {{to help their}} recall memory become {{efficient}} chunking. Chunking {{is the process of}} breaking down numbers into smaller units to remember the information or data, this helps recall numbers and math facts. An example of this chunking process is a telephone number; this is <b>chunked</b> with three digits, three digits, then four digits. People read them off as such when reciting a phone number to another person. There has been research done about these techniques and an institution tested two groups of people to see if these types of devices work well for real people, the results came back determining a significant performance difference between the group who did not use cognitive strategies and the group who did. The group using the techniques immediately performed better than the other group and when taking a pre-test and post-test the results indicated that the group using the techniques improved while the other group did not.|$|E

40|$|<b>Chunking</b> {{is widely}} theorized to be a {{fundamental}} building block of cognition, underlying language, motor control and general problem solving abilities. Recent studies of <b>chunking</b> {{have focused on}} a sequence learning paradigm known as the Discrete Sequence Production task, which is thought to reliably elicit <b>chunks.</b> These <b>chunks</b> have been documented in sequences that are executed at remarkable speeds, greatly exceeding the documented abilities of working memory in simple reaction time task contexts. These <b>chunks</b> further greatly exceed working memory capacity, with previously documented <b>chunk</b> sizes consisting of up to ten elements. Here, we question whether what other researchers have identified as <b>chunks</b> really are <b>chunks,</b> demonstrate that subjects can create putative <b>chunks</b> on demand, and further demonstrate that subjects {{may be able to}} create <b>chunks</b> of up to size 20 with extensive practice, with the salient prediction that there is no limit to <b>chunk</b> size.

50|$|If {{the file}} is {{strictly}} larger than one <b>chunk</b> size, {{a series of}} <b>chunks</b> at file offsets of 2n MiB (n ≥ 0) and one <b>chunk</b> {{right at the end}} of the file are hashed using a CRC32 (polynomial 0xEDB88320 reversed, 0x04C11DB7 normal). The last <b>chunk</b> of the power-of-two series ends strictly more than one <b>chunk</b> size before the end of the file, i.e. there is always at least one unread byte between the last two <b>chunks</b> (if there are that many <b>chunks).</b> The end-of-file <b>chunk</b> may be shorter than one <b>chunk</b> size; it starts at or after one <b>chunk</b> size into the file.

50|$|Consider a Bubblesort, where {{adjacent}} {{records are}} swapped {{in order to}} get them into the right order, so that records appear to “bubble” up and down through the dataspace. If this has to be done in <b>chunks,</b> then when we have sorted all the records in <b>chunk</b> 1, we move on to <b>chunk</b> 2, but we find that some of the records in <b>chunk</b> 1 need to “bubble through” <b>chunk</b> 2, and vice versa (i.e., there are records in <b>chunk</b> 2 that belong in <b>chunk</b> 1, and records in <b>chunk</b> 1 that belong in <b>chunk</b> 2 or later <b>chunks).</b> This will cause the <b>chunks</b> to be read and written back to disk many times as records cross over the boundaries between them, resulting in a considerable degradation of performance. If the data can all be held in memory as one large <b>chunk,</b> then this performance hit is avoided.|$|R
