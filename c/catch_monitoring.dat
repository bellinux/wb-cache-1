40|$|The October 2004 {{monitoring}} survey has seen seagrass area and density (biomass) {{recover from the}} record low levels that occurred in 2002. The beginnings of the recovery process first observed in 2003 had continued with biomass and area returning to levels that occurred prior to the 2002 decline. There was a corresponding reduction in colonising seagrass species and seeds stored in the sediment (seed bank), indicating {{that some of the}} recovery had occurred through germination of stored seeds. Results of the seagrass monitoring program indicate that the Port of Karumba's marine environment appears relatively healthy. The most likely drivers of the observed seagrass loss and recovery in Karumba were related to regional climate rather than human activities or port related factors. The recovery of the seagrass meadows corresponded with a return of some climatic factors such as rainfall and cloud cover (solar irradiance) to more typical levels for the region than had occurred during 2002 and 2003. Changes to the Karumba seagrass meadows may have implications for commercial and recreational fisheries in the region.

40|$|Abstract: This Environmental Assessment {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} establishing a maximized retention and monitoring program in the Pacific whiting shoreside fishery {{off the coast of}} Washington, Oregon, and California. The shorebased whiting fishery has been managed under exempted fisheries permit since 1992. Exempted fishing permits are intended {{to be used as a}} short-term temporary and exploratory response to issues that potentially should be addressed by permanent regulations. Establishing maximized retention requirements and a federal monitoring program will allow NMFS to: account for Chinook salmon catch as specified in the Endangered Species Act section 7 Biological Opinion for Chinook salmon catch in the Pacific groundfish fishery; meet standardized bycatch reporting requirements specified by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act; collect biological data on catch that would otherwise not be available; and create the regulatory structure necessary to efficiently manage the Pacific whiting fishery without exempted fishing permits.

40|$|Collecting {{reliable}} data on {{catch and}} effort {{is one of}} the most challenging tasks that coastal fisheries managers face. Reef fisheries cover dozens, if not hundreds, of spe-cies, and usually involve large numbers of autonomous operators who use a wide range of fishing techniques. Estimating how much fish is extracted from reefs in a particular area using data collected from commercial fishers at landing or sale sites is all but impossible, because commercial small-scale fishers rarely all land or sell their catch at the same place at a predictable time. Furthermore, even if successful, a survey of commercial fishers omits subsistence and recreational fishing activities, which often represent the largest part of all reef fisheries catches in the Pacific.

40|$|Location or stock-specific landing {{data are}} {{necessary}} to improve management of shark stocks, especially those imperiled by overexploitation {{as a result of}} the international shark fin trade. In the current absence of <b>catch</b> <b>monitoring</b> directly at extraction sites, genetic stock identification of fins collected from major market supply chain endpoints offers an overlooked but potentially useful approach for tracing the fins back to their geographical, or stock of, origin. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we used mitochondrial control region (mtCR) sequences to trace the broad geographical origin of 62 Hong Kong market-derived Sphyrna lewini fins. Of these fins 21 % were derived from the western Atlantic, where this species is listed as ‘Endangered’ by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). We also show that S. lewini mtCR sequences are geographically segregated in the western Atlantic (overall ΦST = 0. 74, n = 177 sharks), indicating that breeding females either remain close to, or home back to, their natal region for parturition. Mixed stock analysis simulations showed that it is possible to estimate the relative contributions of these mitochondrial stocks to fin mixtures in globally sourced trade hubs. These findings underscore the feasibility of using genetic stock identification to source market-derived shark fins to obtain essential and otherwise unavailable data on exploitation levels, and thus to productively inform stock assessment and management of S. lewini and potentially also of other fished shark species...|$|E

These {{new approaches to}} natural resource management advocate the inclusion of resource users {{in all aspects of}} management, including monitoring. Research suggests that involvement of local resource users in resource monitoring is beneficial as it promotes local empowerment, community stewardship and contributes to social and resource sustainability. This study aims to contribute knowledge about the nature and effectiveness of a community-based fisheries monitoring system at the Olifants River estuary in South Africa and documents lessons learned. This research reports on the revision and revitalisation of an existing community monitoring program operating at the Olifants River estuary and presents the results of data gathered from this one year monitoring program. It also compares these results with data gathered from previous years when the monitoring system was operational. Finally, {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the community monitoring system are discussed. A participatory research approach was followed by employing members of the Olifants River community as <b>catch</b> <b>monitors</b> and working closely with the fishers and monitors to better understand their perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the monitoring system. Findings of this research suggest that despite weaknesses in the community monitoring system, the data gathered provided useful information about the catch effort trends for the fishery for the year under consideration and also enabled some comparisons of selected fisheries indicators with previous data to be made. These comparisons suggest that catch per unit effort for the target species, harder (Liza richardsonii) is stable and there is no indication of overexploitation of this resource. A key weakness of the monitoring is that it is ad hoc and funding is insecure. Due to poverty levels in the community, local monitors may take up short-term employment opportunities in the community and thus neglect their monitoring responsibilities. This means that the data sets are not comprehensive. Key strengths include the fact that it is simple, cost effective and can be implemented by community members. Furthermore, local involvement in resource monitoring builds capacity and skills as well as local empowerment. Finally, this research contributes to knowledge that can inform the implementation of community monitoring programs proposed by the recently published Small-scale fishing policy of South Africa.

Place and Duration of Study: The study employed data collected from the river Titas in Brahmanbaria district of Bangladesh from 1997 to 2002. Methodology: A census of all constructed Fish Aggregating Devices (Kathas) in the study sites was undertaken. Catch data, including information on species composition and abundance, were collected from Katha fishers during the harvest season. Simultaneously a robust catch assessment was observed for four days per month. Randomly selected samples of catch by species by gear are recorded for each gear type.

40|$|Advances in the {{identification}} of attraction of mirids to semiochemicals has provided the opportunity to exploit synthetically produced sex pheromones and plant produced compounds for controlling pest species in crops. Sex pheromones of mirids are important for long range attraction of males to females and plant volatiles indicate egg laying sites for female mirids. The European tarnished plant bug (Lygus rugulipennis) causes large yield losses (10 -> 80 %) in conventional and organic strawberry. Following the successful development of these semiochemicals in combination with effective traps we investigated the ability of a mass trapping system to reduce damage in strawberry crops in combination with another strawberry pest, strawberry blossom weevil (Anthonomus rubi).

The diving operations were embedded in a regional and global trade network, and its actors operated in a roving manner on multiple spatial levels, taking advantage of unfair patron-client relationships and of the insufficient management in Zanzibar. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This study illustrates that roving dynamics in fisheries, which have been predominantly addressed on a global scale, also take place at a considerably smaller spatial scale. Importantly, while proposed management of the sea cucumber fishery is often generic to a simplified fishery situation, this study illustrates a multifaceted fishery with diverse management requirements. The documented spatial scales and processes in the scuba diving fishery emphasize the need for increased regional governance partnerships to implement management that fit the spatial scales and processes of the operation...|$|E
40|$|Discarding in {{fisheries}} {{is believed}} to be a waste of natural resources, as it is the part of the total catch brought on board but then returned to the sea dead or alive for any reason. This study aims to advance knowledge of the discards associated with the deep water rose shrimp fisheries in the south-central Mediterranean Sea. We address this issue by examining the data collected within the module of commercial <b>catch</b> <b>monitoring</b> (Campbiol) of European data collection framework (DCF) between January 2009 and December 2013. Multivariate data analysis and the generalized additive model (GAMs) were used to assess the spatio-temporal composition of the discard and factors influencing its distribution. Overall, discard represented 32. 9 ± 15. 4 % of the total catch. Multiple analysis of variance highlighted the significant effect on discard assemblage only for the factor of depth (p-value < 0. 05). In general, bony fish were the most discarded organisms (23. 5 ± 14. 4 %). Cartilaginous fish, crustaceans and other invertebrates represented approximately 13 % of the total catch. The fraction of discard in the catch presented significant variation regarding the years, depth and fishing ground. Our results showed that most of the discards in the deep water rose shrimp (DPS) fisheries are due to species that have a minimum legal size (Hake, DPS, Trachurus spp.), and are consequently subjected to the discard ban (art. 15 of the reg. EU 1380 / 2013). To avoid the landing of discards, specific measures aimed to minimize the unwanted catches of undersized species should be implemented...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCoral reef {{fisheries}} {{support the}} development of local and national economies and are the basis of important cultural practices and worldviews. Transitioning economies, human development, and environmental stress can harm this livelihood. Here we focus on a transitioning social-ecological system {{as a case study}} (Moorea, French Polynesia). We review fishing practices and three decades of effort and landing estimates with the broader goal of informing management. Fishery activities in Moorea are quite challenging to quantify because of the diversity of gears used, the lack of centralized access points or markets, the high participation rates of the population in the fishery, and the overlapping cultural and economic motivations to catch fish. Compounding this challenging diversity, we lack a basic understanding of the complex interplay between the cultural, subsistence, and commercial use of Moorea's reefs. In Moorea, we found an order of magnitude gap between estimates of fishery yield produced by <b>catch</b> <b>monitoring</b> methods (2 t km − 2 ∼ year − 1) and estimates produced using consumption or participatory socioeconomic consumer surveys (∼ 24 t km − 2 year − 1). Several lines of evidence suggest reef resources may be overexploited and stakeholders have a diversity of opinions as to whether trends in the stocks are a cause for concern. The reefs, however, remain ecologically resilient. The relative health of the reef is striking given the socioeconomic context. Moorea has a relatively high population density, a modern economic system linked into global flows of trade and travel, and the fishery has little remaining traditional or customary management. Other islands in the Pacific in similar contexts in Polynesia such as Hawaii, that continue to develop economically, may have small-scale fisheries that increasingly resemble Moorea. Therefore, understanding Moorea's reef fisheries may provide insight into their future...|$|E
40|$|Organophosphate {{pesticide}} spraying or {{the deployment}} of explosives as standard practices for controlling quelea breeding colonies or roosts that threaten small-grain crops in Africa have negative side-effects on non-target birds and on the environment. Mass-capture techniques were tested as an environmentally more friendly alternative. The birds caught {{could be used as}} food for local people. Traditional capture methods were also evaluated with a view to improving them. Large funnel traps, with and without bright lights, gave poor results because the behaviour of quelea and the thorny habitat made it difficult to drive the birds into the trap after dark. Locally made mist-nets functioned well. They allowed thousands of quelea to be caught. After a few days, parts of colonies where trapping had taken place were abandoned, and farmers reported a considerable reduction in the numbers of quelea raiding their fields. The proportion of non-target birds caught in the nets was very low and many were released unharmed. <b>Catches</b> were <b>monitored</b> by officials to ensure that only quelea were taken. With further refinement and the establishment of proper regulation, the use of mist-nets to control quelea colonies or roosts seems likely to be a viable alternative to aerial spraying of pesticides...|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{compliance}} with fisheries regulations regarding species caught {{and amount of}} the <b>catch</b> could be <b>monitored</b> when the fishing vessel returned to port, but with whaling factory ships, the whales were processed at sea, and the resulting products from all the baleen whales (whale oil, meat) were combined into a single commodity {{by the time the}} whaling ship reached port. As a consequence, a whaling operation that caught a protected right whale could cover up this infraction by combining the meat and oil with that from legal catches and misreporting it as a legal catch of a fin or several minke whales which would yield the same amount of product. Before DNA analysis of meat products became available very recently, such infractions could not be detected when the factory ship returned to port.|$|R
40|$|Purse seine fishing teams working {{along the}} coast of the Côte d'Ivoire are {{operated}} almost exclusively by fishermen originating from Ghana. The fishing temas concentrated at the Vridi settlement near to Abidjan have been investigated regularly from 1975 to 1985. Their fishing activity, which takes place in the sea or in lagoons, depending on the season, and the resulting <b>catches</b> have been <b>monitored</b> on a daily basis over this period. The fishing teams are entirely split between two groups of Ghanaian fishermen, the Ewe and the Fanti. The Fanti teams are typified by a tendency towards monospecific captures, an ability to change their landing sites and a rapid turnover of teams at Vridi. The Ewe, once installed at the study settlement, tend to stay for longer and as a result adapt their fishing activities to the resources being exploited. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
