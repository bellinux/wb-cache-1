25|$|A typical plywood {{panel has}} face veneers {{of a higher}} grade than the core veneers. The {{principal}} function of the core layers {{is to increase the}} separation between the outer layers where the bending stresses are highest, thus increasing the panel's resistance to bending. As a result, thicker panels can span greater distances under the same loads. In bending, the maximum stress occurs in the outermost layers, one in tension, the other in compression. Bending stress decreases from the maximum at the face layers to nearly zero at the <b>central</b> <b>layer.</b> Shear stress, by contrast, is higher {{in the center of the}} panel, and at the outer fibres.|$|E

In schizolytic dehiscence, a double-dividing {{wall with a}} central lamella (layer) forms between the cells; the <b>central</b> <b>layer</b> then breaks down thereby {{releasing}} the spores.

As new snow fell, the melt-crust became unstable until, on 23 February at 3:59 pm, it failed and caused an enormously powerful powder avalanche to crash down the mountainside, picking up more and more snow as it went. There was also 120 km//hour winds which caused the saltation layer of snow to move causing this disaster.|$|E
40|$|Platinum-group element abundances ranging up to 1, 200 ppb total are {{associated}} with weak, sporadic concentrations of disseminated sulfides in certain cyclic units of the Fox River sill, northeastern Manitoba. The sill is a 250 -km-long, predominantly ultramafic stratiform intrusion of Proterozoic age. The Main Layered series of the intrusion comprises a sequence of cyclic units defined mainly {{on the basis of}} the disappearance and abrupt reappearance of cumulus olivine. The lower <b>central</b> <b>layered</b> zone consists largely of olivine-rich adcumulates that contain little sulfide, whereas the overlying upper <b>central</b> <b>layered</b> zone comprises mainly orthocumulates that contain sporadic platinum-group element-bearing sulfides. Pyrrhotite (75 - 95 %), pentlanditc, chalcopyrite (< 5 %), and minor mackinawitc form the bulk of the texturally well-preserved interstitial sulfides. Ir, Rh, Pt, Pd, and to a lesser degree Au are strongly intercorrelated in the analyzed samples. This probably reflects their mutually consistent partitioning into the immiscible liquid sulfide phase that separated from the silicate melt, and the lack of significant preferential remobilization of any of these platinum-group elements. Ir appears to show partly compatible behavior, abou...|$|R

50|$|The renal {{corpuscle}} filtration {{barrier is}} composed of: the fenestrated endothelium of glomerular capillaries, the fused basal lamina of endothelial cells and podocytes, and the filtration slits of the podocytes. This barrier permits passage of water, ions, and small {{molecules from the}} bloodstream into Bowman's space (the space between the visceral and parietal layers). Large and/or negatively charged proteins are prevented from passing into Bowman's space, thus retaining these proteins in the circulation. The basal lamina is composed of 3 layers: lamina rara externa, lamina densa, and lamina rara interna. The lamina rara externa is adjacent to the podocyte processes. The lamina densa is the <b>central</b> <b>layer</b> consisting of type IV collagen and laminin. This layer acts as a selective macromolecular filter, preventing the passage of large protein molecules into Bowman's space. The lamina rara interna is adjacent to endothelial cells.

A blue-green intermediate layer is formed by Oscillatoria species. Purple sulfur bacteria are found in the pink <b>central</b> <b>layer.</b> Below the pink layer, an orange-black layer is formed predominately by a single species of purple sulfur bacteria, Thiocapsa pfennigii, and spirochetes.
