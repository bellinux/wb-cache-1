A number of questions could be answered by making a check in the appropriate box on the form. From 1850 through 1880 the Census Bureau employed [...] "a system of tallying, which, by reason of the increasing number of combinations of classifications required, became increasingly complex. Only a limited number of combinations could be recorded in one tally, so it was necessary to handle the schedules 5 or 6 times, for as many independent tallies."

40|$|Prior {{research}} {{focused upon}} {{the intersection of}} race, ethnicity, citizenship and identity produced {{as a result of}} the <b>Census</b> <b>Schedule.</b> In this dissertation, I focus on the Census, as an instrument of the state, to capture the process of inclusion and exclusion as it relates specifically to the intersection of sexualities and family formation. Using Sewell?s (1992) concept of dual structures, that is, cultural schemas and resources, I argue that sexuality is structural. Using mixed-methodology and three different data sources, I produce five different indices to determine settlement patterns of same-sex households in various geographic areas. Secondly, drawing on variables operationalized as cultural schema and resources, I identify characteristics of metropolitan areas that have arguably been related to levels of gay and lesbian concentration. In the multivariate context, the variables that are most influential in predicting levels of gay and lesbian concentration are physical temperature index, poverty rate, and heterosexual cohabitation rate. Variables focusing on characteristics of the metropolitan areas of relevance mainly to gays and lesbians such as those dealing with sodomy laws and anti-discrimination laws pertaining to sexual orientation, as well as the presence of political and religious conservatism are either not statistically important predictors or exhibited minimal influences. Through the Internet survey and thirty interviews, I examine how gay and lesbian couples answered the <b>Census</b> <b>Schedule.</b> The highest percentage of individuals marked single on the <b>Census</b> <b>Schedule,</b> suggesting that partnered homosexuals are being underenumerated by the Census Bureau. Furthermore, in regards to the Census and the state, two underlying ideas influence individuals? enactments of agency: legal consciousness and statistical consciousness. Legal consciousness refers to people?s lay understandings of the law, while statistical consciousness refers to everyday knowledge of statistics. In both cases the production of legal interpretation and statistics by authoritative sources is then variously understood, consumed, and employed by ordinary citizens for their distinct purposes. This understanding takes on forms of generally unquestioned folk knowledge, despite being socially constructed in specific historical-cultural contexts. The production and consumption of statistics serve as a pivotal point of contestation of power and resistance, especially for these interviewees...|$|E

40|$|Suppose a {{researcher}} has information on several attributes {{of a collection}} of individuals and that the data he has are available only in qualitative (synonyms are categorical, discrete, polytomous, or ordinal- or nominal- level), as opposed to quantitative (continuous or interval-level) form.

Then he might construct tables, such as Table 1, which show how many people have each set of traits; for example, how many young, unskilled, childless men in a sample were found in both the Boston <b>census</b> <b>schedule</b> in 1880 and the city directory in 1890.

The present study aimed to see the socio-demographic characteristics and reported morbidity wise variation of self-rated health and to examine the association between socio-demographic characteristics and self-rated health of the rural Santals. Methods: Using a standard household <b>census</b> <b>schedule</b> socio-demographic {{data were collected from}} 425 adult Santals of both sexes of Bankura district, West Bengal. SRH data were collected asking people to choose their current health status within five possible options: ‘very good, ’ ‘good, ’ ‘average, ’ ‘bad, ’ and ‘very bad. ’ Univariate and multivariate forward stepwise logistic regression analyses used to examine the association between SRH and socio-demographic characteristics. Results: Majority of the study participant rated their health as ‘average ’ followed by ‘bad, ’ ‘good, ’ and ‘very bad ’ irrespective of sex. Results of univariate logistic regression analyses showed that SRH has significant association with age group, level of education, occupation types, marital status, house type, and sex.

40|$|In {{preparation}} for the 1980 U. S. Census, the U. S. Census Bureau revamped considerably the way it defined, collected, and reported the ancestry of the American population. A long form of the <b>census</b> <b>schedule</b> was developed for application to one in six households. Prior to 1980, Basques were masked under Spanish nationals and French nationals in the final census reports and Basque-Americans were not distinguished at all. This article considers how Basque ethnicity came to be parsed and reported in three fashions—“Basque, Spanish,” “Basque, French,” and “Basque, n. e. c. ” (e. g. “not elsewhere classified”). So it was now possible for Americans to claim Basque ancestry regardless of their birthplace. For scholars of the Basque-American diaspora, the census went from being largely useless to a satisfying analytical tool. However, there have been additional changes in the reporting of ancestry in both the 2000 and 2010 censuses. While the tripartite distinctions are still employed during collection, the responses are currently aggregated into a single Basque category in the reporting process. Consequently, the U. S. census still {{provides an overview of}} the population that self-identifies as Basque, but with less precision than did the last two censuses of the 1900 s...|$|E
