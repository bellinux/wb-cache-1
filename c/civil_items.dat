After calibration by Rasch modeling (Rasch 1960) and other traditional item analysis methods (including goodness-of-fit, item facility, item discrimination, point-biserial correlations, item characteristic curves, and differential item functioning) several items were removed from the analysis due to exhibiting bias. This is further elaborated in OECD 2013 a. Of the 30 MCQs and 3 CRTs (comprising 6 to 8 items), between two and eleven items were removed from different systems. However, most of these were MCQ items (OECD 2013 a, 17).|$|R

40|$|At the {{conclusion}} of a nearly four year study cycle following the closing of the 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC- 12), the 2015 WRC in November of 2015 considered a number of agenda items and issues relevant to systems and spectrum allocations supporting communications, navigation and surveillance for the operation of civil aviation. Among a number of WRC- 15 agenda items and issues, the key agenda <b>items</b> affecting <b>civil</b> aviation included: unmanned aircraft systems use of the Fixed Satellite Service for command and control communications; global flight tracking; new allocations to International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT); and protection of the Fixed Satellite Service to support safe operation of aircraft. A number of other agenda items affecting or potentially affecting civil aviation were also addressed by WRC- 15.
