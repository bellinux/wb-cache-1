His family {{consisted}} of seven children—three brothers and four sisters—with Singh being the youngest son. As a young boy, Singh always hated school, as he was unable to cope with the restricted environment. One day, after being scolded by his <b>class</b> <b>teacher</b> for quarreling with one of his classmates, Singh ran away, and never returned to school. After that, Singh continued to help his parents in their farm, and grew up to be well-built and handsome youth. Shikar, a local Indian sport, was his favourite game. Though Singh wanted to join the army from his childhood, he was rejected twice, as he was too young, before he was accepted at the age of eighteen.|$|E

The majority of the teaching takes place in the Nash's building and in Tisdall's. Boys will use the specialist facilities for French, Art, ICT, Music and Design Technology.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} if the <b>class</b> <b>teachers</b> believe that their education has given them enough knowledge about dyslexia in order to succeed a successful education for these pupils.

The study aims to find out if <b>class</b> <b>teachers</b> believe that they have enough knowledge to determine whether a pupil has dyslexia. If they have knowledge of appropriate methods and if they know how to prevent that pupils fall behind in their literacy and also what factors they believes makes it problematic to implement a literacy for these pupils. I propose the following questions: Do the <b>class</b> <b>teachers</b> consider that their education has given them sufficient knowledge of dyslexia and its characteristics? What methods does the <b>class</b> <b>teachers</b> and special education teachers considers as useful for pupils with dyslexia? What does the <b>class</b> <b>teachers</b> consider can prevent that pupils with dyslexia fall behind in their reading and writing skills? What factors consider <b>class</b> <b>teachers</b> and special education teachers is problematic to to succeed a reading and writing education for pupils with dyslexia? This study is based on a qualitative method and my theoretical approach is based on Høien and Lundberg established view of what dyslexia is. The results show that teacher’s university studies do not provide sufficient knowledge about dyslexia and appropriate methods. This problem is also described in the research I have used. Attributed to this it is obvious that <b>class</b> <b>teachers</b> have enough knowledge what dyslexia is and they could tell which methods that are good to use. They could also declare how to prevent that pupil’s with dyslexia fall behind in their reading and writing education.

2500|$|Each class {{normally}} remains {{together as}} a cohort throughout their years, developing as a quasi-familial social group whose members know each other quite deeply. In the elementary years, a core teacher teaches the primary academic subjects. A central role of this <b>class</b> <b>teacher</b> is to provide supportive role models both through personal example and through stories drawn {{from a variety of}} cultures, educating by exercising creative, loving authority. Class teachers are normally expected to teach a group of children for several years, a practice known as looping. The traditional goal was for the teacher to remain with a class for the eight years of the [...] "lower school" [...] cycle, but in recent years the duration of these cycles has been increasingly treated flexibly. Already in first grade, specialized teachers teach many of the subjects, including music, crafts, movement, and two foreign languages from complementary language families (in English-speaking countries often German and either Spanish or French); these subjects remain central to the curriculum throughout the elementary school years.|$|E
