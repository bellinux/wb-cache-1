40|$|This report {{presents}} JRC {{data and}} quantitative analyses estimating {{the amounts of}} EU total, eligible and <b>covered</b> <b>deposits.</b> Three sources of data {{have been used to}} build the dataset: ­- a survey distributed by JRC in summer 2013 to all mandatory EU deposit guarantee schemes; - ECB public statistics on aggregated balance sheets of MFIs and ­- Bankscope data to cross check and combine data from the above sources. Considering all EU MS total deposits amount to roughly 14, 500 EUR billion in 2011 - 2012. Deposits eligible for protection from deposits guarantee schemes represent on average 74 % of the total deposits.

50|$|Climate {{directly}} {{affects the}} rate of weathering and leaching. Wind moves sand and smaller particles (dust), especially in arid regions where there is little plant <b>cover,</b> <b>depositing</b> it close or far from the entrainment source. The type and amount of precipitation influence soil formation by affecting the movement of ions and particles through the soil, and aid {{in the development of}} different soil profiles. Soil profiles are more distinct in wet and cool climates, where organic materials may accumulate, than in wet and warm climates, where organic materials are rapidly consumed. The effectiveness of water in weathering parent rock material depends on seasonal and daily temperature fluctuations, which favour tensile stresses in rock minerals, and thus their mechanical disaggregation, a process called thermal fatigue. By the same process freeze-thaw cycles are an effective mechanism which breaks up rocks and other consolidated materials.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{performed}} {{electron microscopy}} analysis of carbon tiles dismantled from the toroidal limiter of the Tore Supra tokamak.

On the contrary, the tile gap surfaces are <b>covered</b> with <b>deposits</b> whatever {{the region of}} the limiter. We analyzed both the topography and the microstructure of gap deposits. Deposits are tip-shaped and deposition is significant only down to ~ 1 mm, due to the limited penetration of ions. The direction of tips results from the combination of the ion speed along the magnetic lines and the drift associated to the local electric fields. The microstructure of deposits reveals the presence of graphitic species, such as onion-like nanoparticles, and our results therefore show that deposition results from local plasma chemistry similar to what is observed for cold plasmas...|$|R
