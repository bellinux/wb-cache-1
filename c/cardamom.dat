The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the <b>Cardamom</b> mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project. In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Khmer dialects, {{although}} mutually intelligible, {{are sometimes}} quite marked. Notable variations {{are found in}} speakers from Phnom Penh (Cambodia's capital city), the rural Battambang area, the areas of Northeast Thailand adjacent to Cambodia such as Surin province, the <b>Cardamom</b> Mountains, and southern Vietnam. The dialects form a continuum running roughly north to south. Standard Cambodian Khmer is mutually intelligible with the others but a Khmer Krom speaker from Vietnam, for instance, may have great difficulty communicating with a Khmer native of Sisaket Province in Thailand.|$|E

40|$|Oxidative {{stress in}} a patient with {{diabetes}} known to decrease the activity of GSH-PX and increase the level of blood glucose. Glibenclamide is commonly used by patients with diabetes to lower the blood glucose. However, the long-term use of glibenclamide may induce the damage of pancreatic β-cells. The extract containing flavonoids and vitamin C of <b>cardamoms</b> leaf can reduce free radicals. The effect of <b>cardamoms</b> leaf extract on the enzymes activity {{and the level of}} blood glucose in diabetic rats is yet unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of <b>cardamoms</b> leaf extract administration in the GSH-PX activities and the level of blood glucose of diabetic rats. The method used in this study was experimental with completely randomized design (CRD). There were three groups with five replicates for each. The first group, diabetic rats as control group were given no treatment; the second group, diabetic rats were given <b>cardamoms</b> leaf extract at the dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight; the third group, the diabetic rat were given glibenclamide at the dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight. Blood samples were taken three times at 0, 7, and 14 days after each treatment. Parameters measured were GSH-PX activity and the level of blood glucose. The data were analyzed using ANOVA F-test with a confidence level of 95 %. The result of this study showed that the <b>cardamoms</b> leaf extract treatment decreased the activity of GSH-PX activity and decreased the level of blood glucose at a significant level (p < 0. 05) from 278. 8 to 101. 4 mg/dl...|$|R

5|$|Kerala {{produces}} 97% of {{the national}} output of black pepper and accounts for 85% of the natural rubber in the country. Coconut, tea, coffee, cashew, and spices—including <b>cardamom,</b> vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg are the main agricultural products. 80% of India's export quality cashew kernels are prepared in Kollam. The key agricultural staple is rice, with varieties grown in extensive paddy fields. Home gardens made up {{a significant portion of}} the agricultural sector. Related animal husbandry is touted by proponents as a means of alleviating rural poverty and unemployment among women, the marginalised, and the landless. The state government promotes these activities via educational campaigns and the development of new cattle breeds such as the Sunandini.|$|E

5|$|The Gangavadi region {{consisted}} of the malnad region, the plains (Bayaluseemae) and the semi-malnad with lower elevation and rolling hills. The main crops of the malnad region were paddy, betel leaves, <b>cardamom</b> and pepper and the semi-malnad region with its lower altitude produced rice, millets such as ragi and corn, pulses, oilseeds {{and it was also}} the base for cattle farming. The plains to the east were the flat lands fed by Kaveri, Tungabhadra and Vedavati rivers where cultivations of sugarcane, paddy, coconut, areca nut (adeka totta), betel leaves, plantain and flowers (vara vana) were common. Sources of irrigation were excavated tanks, wells, natural ponds and water bodies in the catchment area of dams (Katta). Inscriptions attesting to irrigation of previously uncultivated lands seem to indicate an expanding agrarian community.|$|E

Neora Valley National Park that lies within the Kalimpong subdivision and is home to tigers. Acacia is the most commonly found species at lower altitudes, while cinnamon, ficus, bamboo and <b>cardamom,</b> are found in the hillsides around Kalimpong. The forests found at higher altitudes are made up of pine trees and other evergreen alpine vegetation. Seven species of rhododendrons are found in the region east of Kalimpong. The temperate deciduous forests include oak, birch, maple and alder. Three hundred species of orchid are found around Kalimpong.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the empire was largely {{dependent}} on agriculture. Sorghum (jowar), cotton, and pulse legumes grew in semi-arid regions, while sugarcane, rice, and wheat thrived in rainy areas. Betel leaves, areca (for chewing), and coconut were the principal cash crops, and large scale cotton production supplied the weaving centers of the empire's vibrant textile industry. Spices such as turmeric, pepper, <b>cardamom,</b> and ginger grew in the remote Malnad hill region and were transported to the city for trade. The empire's capital city was a thriving business centre that included a burgeoning market in large quantities of precious gems and gold. Prolific temple-building provided employment to thousands of masons, sculptors, and other skilled artisans.|$|E

The 470th cleared the population out of the Mekong River town and turned it into its administrative headquarters. PAVN Base Areas to the east were fed by Kratie while men and supplies headed for the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam were now circled westward, around Phanom Penh, through the foothills of the <b>Cardamom</b> Mountains and then east again to cross the border.|$|E
5|$|The {{tertiary}} sector comprises {{services such as}} transport, storage, communications, tourism, banking, insurance and real estate. In 2011–2012, it contributed 63.22% of the state's GDP, agriculture and allied sectors contributed 15.73%, while manufacturing, construction and utilities contributed 21.05%. Nearly half of Kerala's people depend on agriculture alone for income. Around 600 varieties of rice, which is Kerala's most used staple and cereal crop, are harvested from 3105.21km2; a decline from 5883.4km2 in 1990. 688,859tonnes of rice are produced per year. Other key crops include coconut; 899,198ha, tea, coffee; 23% of Indian production, or 57,000 tonnes, rubber, cashews, and spices—including pepper, <b>cardamom,</b> vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Khmer speakers speak Central Khmer, the dialect of the central plain where the Khmer are most heavily concentrated. Within Cambodia, regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of Central Khmer. Two exceptions are the speech of the capital, Phnom Penh, {{and that of the}} Khmer Khe in Stung Treng province, both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer. Outside of Cambodia, three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic Khmers native to areas that were historically part of the Khmer Empire. The Northern Khmer dialect is spoken by over a million Khmers in the southern regions of Northeast Thailand and is treated by some linguists as a separate language. Khmer Krom, or Southern Khmer, is the first language of the Khmer of Vietnam while the Khmer living in the remote <b>Cardamom</b> mountains speak a very conservative dialect that still displays features of the Middle Khmer language.|$|E
5|$|Tipu Sultan is {{credited}} to have founded state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom. In addition, he founded depots in foreign locations such as Karachi, Jeddah and Muscat, where Mysore products were sold. During Tipu's rule French technology {{was used for}} the first time in carpentry and smithy, Chinese technology was used for sugar production, and technology from Bengal helped improve the sericulture industry. State factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state held the monopoly in the production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, <b>cardamom,</b> betel nut, tobacco and sandalwood, as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries and sericulture was developed in twenty-one centers within the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|When {{merchant}} ships docked, {{the merchandise}} {{was taken into}} official custody and taxes levied on all items sold. The security of the merchandise was guaranteed by the administration officials. Traders of many nationalities (Arabs, Persians, Guzerates, Khorassanians) settled in Calicut, drawn by the thriving trade business. Ship building prospered and keeled ships of 1000–1200 bahares (burden) were built without decks by sewing the entire hull with ropes rather than fastening them with nails. Ships sailed to the Red Sea ports of Aden and Mecca with Vijayanagara goods sold {{as far away as}} Venice. The empire's principal exports were pepper, ginger, cinnamon, <b>cardamom,</b> myrobalan, tamarind timber, anafistula, precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, musk, ambergris, rhubarb, aloe, cotton cloth and porcelain. Cotton yarn was shipped to Burma and indigo to Persia. Chief imports from Palestine were copper, quicksilver (mercury), vermilion, coral, saffron, coloured velvets, rose water, knives, coloured camlets, gold and silver. Persian horses were imported to Cannanore before a two-week land trip to the capital. Silk arrived from China and sugar from Bengal.|$|E
50|$|Chhena kheeri {{is made by}} deep frying {{cubes of}} chhena cheese.
