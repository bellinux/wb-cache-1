25|$|One might inquire why the <b>contact</b> <b>potential</b> {{does not}} appear in Kirchhoff's law of {{voltages}} as one contribution to the sum of potential drops.

The sum of all the contact potentials is zero, and so they may be ignored in Kirchhoff's law.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{present a}} novel method, HMMSTR-CM, for protein contact map predictions. <b>Contact</b> <b>potentials</b> were {{calculated}} by using HMMSTR, a hidden Markov model for local sequence structure correlations. Targets were aligned against protein templates using a Bayesian method, and contact maps were generated by using these alignments. <b>Contact</b> <b>potentials</b> then {{were used to}} evaluate these templates. An ab initio method based on the target <b>contact</b> <b>potentials</b> using a rule-based strategy to model the protein-folding pathway was developed. Fold recognition and ab initio methods were combined to produce accurate, protein-like contact maps. Pathways sometimes led to an unambiguous prediction of topology, even without using templates. The results on CASP 5 targets are discussed. Also included is a brief update {{on the quality of}} fully automated ab initio predictions using the I-sites server. Proteins 2003; 53 : 497 – 502...|$|R

25|$|Operation of a {{solar cell}} can be {{understood}} from the equivalent circuit at right. Light, of sufficient energy (greater than the bandgap of the material), creates mobile electron–hole pairs in a semiconductor. Charge separation occurs because of a pre-existing electric field associated with the p-n junction in thermal equilibrium (a <b>contact</b> <b>potential</b> creates the field). This charge separation between positive holes and negative electrons across a p-n junction (a diode) yields a forward voltage, the photo voltage, between the illuminated diode terminals. As has been noted earlier in the terminology section, the photo voltage is {{sometimes referred to as}} the photo emf, rather than distinguishing between the effect and the cause. The charge separation causes a photo voltage that drives current through any attached load.|$|E
25|$|When solids of two {{different}} materials are in contact, thermodynamic equilibrium requires one of the solids assume a higher electrical potential than the other. This is called the <b>contact</b> <b>potential.</b> Dissimilar metals in contact produce what is known also as a contact electromotive force or Galvani potential. The magnitude of this potential difference is often expressed as a difference in Fermi levels in the two solids when they are at charge neutrality, where the Fermi level (a name for the chemical potential of an electron system) describes the energy necessary to remove an electron from the body to some common point (such as ground). If there is an energy advantage in taking an electron from one body to the other, such a transfer will occur. The transfer causes a charge separation, with one body gaining electrons and the other losing electrons. This charge transfer causes a potential difference between the bodies, which partly cancels the potential originating from the contact, and eventually equilibrium is reached. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Fermi levels are equal (the electron removal energy is identical) and {{there is now a}} built-in electrostatic potential between the bodies.|$|E
2500|$|Electromotive force, {{also called}} emf (denoted [...] and {{measured}} in volts), is the voltage developed by any source of electrical energy {{such as a}} battery or dynamo. It is generally defined as the electrical potential for a source in a circuit. In the open-circuit case, charge separation continues until the electrical field from the separated charges is sufficient to arrest the reactions. Years earlier, Alessandro Volta, who had measured a <b>contact</b> <b>potential</b> difference at the metal–metal (electrode–electrode) interface of his cells, had held the incorrect opinion that contact alone (without taking into account a chemical reaction) was {{the origin of the}} emf.|$|E

It is shown that a localized potential dip forms at the low potential end of a DL, which interrupts the electron current through it according to the Langmuir criterion whenever the ion flux into the DL is disrupted.

2500|$|The diode {{possesses}} a [...] "built-in potential" [...] {{due to the}} <b>contact</b> <b>potential</b> {{difference between the two}} different materials {{on either side of the}} junction. This built-in potential is established when the junction is manufactured and that voltage a by-product of thermodynamic equilibrium within the cell. Once established, this potential difference cannot drive a current, however, as connecting a load does not upset this equilibrium. [...] In contrast, the accumulation of excess electrons in one region and of excess holes in another, due to illumination, results in a photo voltage that does drive a current when a load is attached to the illuminated diode. As noted above, this photo voltage also forward biases the junction, and so reduces the pre-existing field in the depletion region.|$|E

50|$|For <b>contact</b> <b>potential</b> {{measurements}} a lock-in amplifier is used {{to detect}} the cantilever oscillation at ω. During the scan VDC will be adjusted so that the electrostatic forces between the tip and the sample become zero and thus the response at the frequency ω becomes zero. Since the electrostatic force at ω depends on VDC − VCPD, the value of VDC that minimizes the ω-term corresponds to the <b>contact</b> <b>potential.</b> Absolute values of the sample work function can be obtained if the tip is first calibrated against a reference sample of known work function. Apart from this, one can use the normal topographic scan methods at the resonance frequency ω independently of the above. Thus, in one scan, the topography and the <b>contact</b> <b>potential</b> of the sample are determined simultaneously.This {{can be done in}} (at least) two different ways: 1) The topography is captured in AC mode which means that the cantilever is driven by a piezo at its resonant frequency. Simultaneously the AC voltage for the KPFM measurement is applied at a frequency slightly lower than the resonant frequency of the cantilever. In this measurement mode the topography and the <b>contact</b> <b>potential</b> difference are captured {{at the same time and}} this mode is often called single-pass. 2) One line of the topography is captured either in contact or AC mode and is stored internally. Then, this line is scanned again, while the cantilever remains on a defined distance to the sample without a mechanically driven oscillation but the AC voltage of the KPFM measurement is applied and the <b>contact</b> <b>potential</b> is captured as explained above. It is important to note that the cantilever tip must not be too close to the sample in order to allow good oscillation with applied AC voltage. Therefore, KPFM can be performed simultaneously during AC topography measurements but not during contact topography measurements.|$|E
