40|$|In {{this paper}} we present three {{theoretically}} grounded methods: prediction, reconstruction and interpolation, for measuring <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> on the bottleneck link of an end-toend path. The {{objective is to}} infer <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> as accurately as possible, while not injecting {{a significant amount of}} probe packets into the network. In the prediction-based method, we take advantage of the LRD characteristic of the <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> to predict the future traffic based on the recent information obtained by probe packets. In the reconstruction method, we rebuild the entire <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> process with the information obtained by probe packets. In the interpolation method, we periodically send closely-spaced probe packet pairs to sample <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> of the bottleneck link, and infer <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> between two sampling points using interpolation. The simulation study indicates that (i) the prediction-based and reconstruction methods can give good mean measurement of <b>cross</b> <b>traffic,</b> while the interpolation method usually captures the instantaneous value of <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> better; and (ii) all three methods are adaptive to the dynamic change of <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> and are quite robust in the presence of multiple bottleneck links on an end-to-end path...|$|R

40|$|The use of radar in {{automotive}} {{applications such}} as adaptive cruise control is limited to detecting target vehicles {{directly in front of}} the host vehicle. Vehicles around a curve on a highway and <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> vehicles at an intersection cannot be detected by current radar systems. This is primarily due to the limited beam width angle of the radar. The first part of this report examines and evaluates the novel concept of using passive roadside reflectors (PRRs) to increase the utility of the radar system. PRRs on the shoulder and the median of a road are designed that would enable the radar system to pick up <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> at highway intersections. Both simulations and experiments demonstrate that this concept could be effectively used for <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> distance measurement. A limitation of this technology is that <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> cannot be detected when the radar equipped vehicle is very close to the intersection due to the lateral offset of the radar from the location of the PRR. However, the system is still valuable for providing future warning of <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> at rural intersections. A number of options are explored for the use of PRRs to improve radar measurements on highway curves.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} the congestion-control {{problem in a}} commu-nication network with multiple traffic sources, each modeled as a fully-controllable stream of fluid traffic. The controlled traffic shares a common bottleneck node with high-priority <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> described by a Markov-modulated fluid (MMF). Each controlled source is assumed to have a unique round-trip delay. We wish to maximize a linear combination of the throughput, delay, traffic loss rate, and a fairness metric at the bottle-neck node. We introduce an online sampling-based burst-level congestion-control scheme capable of performing effectively under rapidly-varying <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> by making explicit use of the provided MMF model of that variation. The control problem is posed as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and is solved heuristically using a technique called Hindsight Opti-mization. We provide a detailed derivation of our congestion-control algo-rithm based on this technique. The distinguishing feature of our scheme relative to conventional congestion-control schemes is that we exploit a stochastic model of the <b>cross</b> <b>traffic.</b> Our empirical study shows that our control scheme significantly outperforms the conventional proportional-derivative (PD) controller, achieving higher utlization, lower delay, and lower loss under reasonable fairness. The performance advantage of our scheme over the PD scheme grows as the rate variance of <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> in-creases, underscoring the effectiveness of our control scheme under vari-able <b>cross</b> <b>traffic.</b> Keywords—Communication networks, congestion control, traffic mod-els, Markov-modulated fluid, Markov decision processes, online sampling.

These three parameters determine the dynamics of the queue in the diffusive approximation and all important distributions and averages of the packet separation.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a sender-side-only {{filtering}} method to improve the accuracy of buffer estimation. Buffer estimates are of interest in many applications, e. g. enhancing the performance and behavior of TCP, as well as improving the user experience of UDP applications. A conventional approach to estimate the buffer size of the bottleneck link is to estimate the packet round trip time (RTT) values that include the maximum and minimum queuing delays. By calculating the difference of these two values, one can then estimate the buffer size. However, such approach is shown to be problematic {{in the presence of}} lossy links, bursty <b>cross</b> <b>traffic,</b> and multiple bottleneck links. This paper introduces a new technique called Dispersion Delta Filtering (DDF) which takes not only the RTT range but also packet dispersion into consideration. The dispersion data is used to filter out RTT samples affected by bursty <b>cross</b> <b>traffic.</b> By filtering these nonrepresentative RTT samples, the proposed method is able to estimate the buffer more accurately under bursty <b>cross</b> <b>traffic</b> scenarios. We augment TCPW-BBE (TCP Westwood with Buffer and Bandwidth Estimation) to evaluate the accuracy of a buffer estimate with and without the proposed filtering algorithm. Simulation results show that by incorporating the proposed filtering technique, TCPW-BBE obtains a more accurate buffer estimate regardless of the rates of bursty <b>cross</b> <b>traffic,</b> the direction of bursty <b>cross</b> <b>traffic,</b> as well as the number of coexisting flows.
