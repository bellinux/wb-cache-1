40|$|AbstractThe {{austenitic}} stainless steel AISI 316 L is used in chemical and other industries due to its good corrosion properties; however, it has a poor wear resistance. Plasma assisted treatments such as diffusion process and/or coatings {{can be used in}} order to improve the tribological properties. The a:C-H-Si coatings have low friction coefficient and wear resistance; in addition, they are chemically inert although they present adhesion problems when they are deposited on metallic substrates. In this work, the mechanical behavior and adhesion of the a:C-H-Si coatings deposited on nitrided AISI 316 L stainless steel (duplex sample) and without nitriding (<b>coated</b> <b>sample)</b> were studied. The coatings were characterized by EDS and Raman. The hardness and Young Modulus were assessed with nanoindentation. The microstructure of the nitrided layer and the coatings was analysed by OM, SEM-FIB and XRD. Pin on disk and linear sliding tests were carried out. The adhesion was evaluated using Indentation Rockwell C and Scratch test. The coatings had high hydrogen content, over 40 %, and the film thickness was about 20 μm. The hardness was about 13 GPa and Young's Modulus was 73 GPa. The friction coefficient was less than 0. 2 and the wear resistance was better than in stainless steel without any treatment. In the linear sliding tests, the track depth in the duplex and coated samples was six times lower than in the untreated sample. The nitriding had influence on the adhesion; the critical load was 16. 2 N in the duplex sample and of 9. 6 N in the <b>coated</b> <b>sample.</b> In the indentation Rockwell C test, the duplex sample also had better adhesion than the only <b>coated</b> <b>sample...</b>|$|E
30|$|The coating {{effect on}} the {{electrochemical}} property was very clearly observed during cycling at high temperature (45 °C). The discharge capacity of the pristine film significantly decreased to nearly zero during 20 cycles (Figure 2 d). Cyclic performance of the coated film also deteriorated compared with Figure 2 a. However, the <b>coated</b> <b>sample</b> showed much enhanced cyclic performance over the pristine sample. The improved rate capability and cyclic performance of the <b>coated</b> <b>sample</b> have been explained by the protective effect of the coating layer. In general, {{the surface of the}} cathode forms an interface layer during cycling due to a reaction with the acidic electrolyte. The transition metals (Co, Ni, Mn) of the cathode could easily dissolve into the electrolyte so that the unwanted interface layer could be formed, which interrupts diffusion of the lithium ions and movement of electrons during cycling. A stable coating layer (AlPO 4) could protect the surface of the cathode electrode from an attack by the acidic electrolyte and suppress the formation of an unwanted surface layer, leading to the enhanced rate capability and cyclic performance.|$|E
