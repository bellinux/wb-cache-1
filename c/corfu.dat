5|$|On 13 February 1386 <b>Corfu</b> became {{once more}} a Venetian {{possession}} {{and this time}} Venetian rule would last {{until the end of}} the Republic. This was accomplished voluntary by the people of <b>Corfu.</b> On 10 May, the Corfiotes appointed five ambassadors to submit to the Venetian senate. The Ottomans made several attempts to capture <b>Corfu,</b> the first of which was in 1537. This attack led Venice to an alliance with the Pope and Emperor Charles V, known as the Holy League, against the Ottoman Empire. Another major unsuccessful Ottoman attack was that of July 1716.|$|E
5|$|On 21 September 1923, {{the ship}} transported to Taranto {{the bodies of}} the members of the Boundary Commission killed on <b>Corfu</b> on 27 August (their deaths sparked the <b>Corfu</b> incident). On 1 October, San Marco ferried the last {{occupation}} troops from <b>Corfu</b> to Brindisi. On 16 March 1924, she saluted King Victor Emmanuel III when he arrived in Fiume to attend the ceremony commemorating the city's annexation by Italy. San Marco escorted Crown Prince Umberto, travelling aboard San Giorgio, during his South American tour in July–September 1924.|$|E

5|$|On 25 July 1805, Nicolls was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} captain, and assigned command of a company which embarked in HMS Standard. During 1807 and 1808, Nicolls participated in the siege of <b>Corfu</b> and in a foray to Egypt. It was during this period, too, that he was honourably mentioned in dispatches for his part in the Dardanelles Operation, during which he captured a Turkish flag. In 1808 he led the boat attack from the Standard which captured the Italian gunboat Volpe off <b>Corfu.</b>|$|E
5|$|Production of For Your Eyes Only {{began on}} 2 September 1980 in the North Sea, with three days {{shooting}} exterior scenes for the scenes involving the St Georges spyboat. The interiors were shot later in Pinewood Studios, {{as well as}} the ship's explosion, which was done with a miniature in Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage. On 15 September principal photography started in <b>Corfu</b> at the Villa Sylva at Kanoni, above <b>Corfu</b> Town, which acted as the location of the Spanish villa.|$|E
5|$|Dividing the {{captured}} British sailors, Lejoille transferred half to Généreux and left half on Leander with a French prize crew under Louis Gabriel Deniéport. In direct contravention {{of the established}} conventions of war, both sets of prisoners were immediately ordered to effect repairs to the vessels. Only once both ships were ready for the journey to <b>Corfu</b> were the prisoners given bread and water, although the wounded were still denied medical attention. For ten days after the engagement the battered ships sailed northwards against the wind, Généreux forced to attach a tow to Leander to avoid leaving the prize behind. On 28 August, a sail appeared to the south. Panic broke out on Généreux, and Lejoille ordered the prisoners confined below and for preparations {{to be made to}} abandon Leander and make all speed for <b>Corfu.</b> The new arrival was in fact the 16-gun British sloop HMS Mutine under Lieutenant Thomas Bladen Capel, carrying the second copies of Nelson's despatches to Britain. Capel sighted the ships to the north, but assumed that they were Généreux and Guillaume Tell and so passed by displaying French colours. Lejoille was not fooled by the disguise but did not pursue the small vessel, continuing his passage to <b>Corfu</b> once Mutine had sailed out of sight.|$|E
5|$|Jews {{were also}} a native {{religious}} group to the Islands during the Venetian period. They were even fewer in number than the Catholics; in 1797 the number of Jews in <b>Corfu</b> {{appears to have been}} only two thousand. Jewish presence in <b>Corfu</b> can be traced since the times of the Principality of Taranto. In Cephalonia, there is evidence of Jewish habitation in the old capital, the Castle of St. George, since the early 17th century. When the capital of the island was transferred to Argostoli the Jews resettled there.|$|E
5|$|Mussolini sent a warship {{to shell}} the Greek island of <b>Corfu,</b> and Italian forces {{occupied}} the island on 31 August 1923. This contravened the League's covenant, so Greece {{appealed to the}} League {{to deal with the}} situation. The Allies agreed (at Mussolini's insistence) that the Conference of Ambassadors should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered. Italian forces then withdrew from <b>Corfu.</b>|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Vladimir Šaškijević {{replaced}} Pavić as captain. In August 1935, Dubrovnik visited <b>Corfu</b> and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia. In August 1937, Dubrovnik visited Istanbul and the Greek {{ports of}} Mudros {{in the northern}} Aegean Sea and Piraeus near Athens.|$|E
5|$|A death {{certificate}} discovered in 2009 shows that Beato {{was born in}} Venice in 1832 and died on 29 January 1909 in Florence. The {{death certificate}} also indicates {{that he was a}} British subject and a bachelor. It is likely that early in his life Beato and his family moved to <b>Corfu,</b> at the time part of the British protectorate of the Ionian Islands, and so Beato was a British subject.|$|E
5|$|Bojić's {{popularity}} grew exponentially {{following his}} death. Many of his poems received widespread critical acclaim for their {{portrayal of the}} Serbian Army's retreat {{during the winter of}} 1915–16 and its stay on <b>Corfu,</b> where thousands of soldiers succumbed to disease and exhaustion and were buried at sea. Bojić's work remained popular in Yugoslavia for much of the 20th century, cementing his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest Serbian poets of the Romantic period.|$|E
5|$|From May 1864, George {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} the Peloponnese, through Corinth, Argos, Tripolitsa, Sparta, and Kalamata, where he embarked on the frigate Hellas. Proceeding northwards along the coast accompanied by British, French and Russian naval vessels, the Hellas reached <b>Corfu</b> on 6 June, for the ceremonial handover of the Ionian Islands by the British High Commissioner, Sir Henry Storks.|$|E
5|$|In 1147 Manuel {{was faced}} with war by Roger II of Sicily, whose fleet had {{captured}} the Byzantine island of <b>Corfu</b> and plundered Thebes and Corinth. However, despite being distracted by a Cuman attack in the Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of Conrad III of Germany, and {{the help of the}} Venetians, who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet. In 1149, Manuel recovered <b>Corfu</b> and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent George of Antioch with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople's suburbs. Manuel had already agreed with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily. The renewal of the German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel's foreign policy {{for the rest of his}} reign, despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad's death.|$|E
5|$|In December 1943, the LRDG re-organised {{into two}} squadrons of eight patrols. Each patrol {{contained}} one officer and 10 other ranks. Major Moir Stormonth Darling was given {{command of the}} British Squadron and Major Kenneth Henry Lazarus the Rhodesian Squadron. Patrols were then parachuted north of Rome to obtain information about German troop movements, and also carried out raids on the Dalmatian Islands and <b>Corfu.</b>|$|E
5|$|In June and July 1930, Hrabri, Nebojša and {{the fleet}} {{auxiliary}} Sitnica again cruised the Mediterranean, visiting Alexandria and Beirut. In 1932, the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets. In September 1933, Nebojša and the submarine Osvetnik cruised {{the southern part}} of the central Mediterranean. In August 1936, Nebojša and Osvetnik visited the Greek island of <b>Corfu.</b>|$|E
5|$|In another {{patrol in}} July, U-14 sailed {{on the north}} side of the island of <b>Corfu</b> while headed for Santi Quaranta, Albania. Because the harbor at <b>Corfu</b> was {{occupied}} by the French fleet at the time, U-14 conducted a ruse de guerre by flying the submarine's former national flag, the French tricolor, in order to pass unmolested. Even though U-14s new conning tower made her look unlike any other Brumaire-class boat, one French patrol plane was successfully fooled by the ruse. When U-14s crew first spotted the aircraft, flying towards them from the direction of the sun, there was not enough time to submerge. As the aircraft drew near, its French markings—and its cargo of bombs—became apparent to the crew. With no other course of action possible, U-14s crew waved their hats and handkerchiefs at the plane. As the French pilot passed overhead, he returned the waves, apparently unaware of the U-boat's true nationality. The only success by U-14 on this cruise was the sinking of Marionga Goulandris, a Greek steamer, near Cape Matapan.|$|E
5|$|In the Ionian Islands, P.fluviatile {{is known}} to occur at only one site on <b>Corfu,</b> {{as well as on}} Kefalonia, Lefkada and Zakynthos. In the Aegean Islands, it is found on Skiathos and Skopelos (Sporades), on Euboea and Skyros, and at a single site on Andros in the Cyclades.|$|E
5|$|In the {{clashes with}} the Normans through the 1080s, the only {{effective}} Byzantine naval force was a squadron commanded, and possibly maintained, by Michael Maurex, a veteran naval commander of previous decades. Together with the Venetians, he initially prevailed over the Norman fleet, but the joint fleet was {{caught off guard}} and defeated by the Normans off <b>Corfu</b> in 1084.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1798, a British fleet {{surprised}} and almost completely destroyed the French Mediterranean Fleet at the Battle of the Nile {{in the aftermath}} of the successful French invasion of Egypt. This immediately reversed the strategic situation in the Mediterranean Sea, eliminating the French fleet based at Toulon as a significant threat and granting the British and their allies in the War of the Second Coalition naval dominance in the region. Over the next three years, British and allied squadrons enforced blockades against all significant French and Spanish naval bases in the region, including Alexandria, <b>Corfu</b> and Malta but particularly the significant harbours at Toulon and Cadiz. This drastically limited the movement of French troops and military materials across the Mediterranean, with the result that Malta and <b>Corfu</b> were captured and the army in Egypt was steadily reduced in size and effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 1917, as the Austro-Hungarian Fleet was {{preparing}} to attack the Otranto Barrage that blocked the exit from the Adriatic Sea, Varese was {{at the port of}} Butrino on the north coast of <b>Corfu.</b> She did not, however, sortie in response to the Austro-Hungarian movements. She became a cadet training ship from 1920 to 1922. She was stricken on 4 January 1923 and scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Production of For Your Eyes Only {{began on}} 2 September 1980 in the North Sea, with three days {{shooting}} exterior scenes with the St Georges. The interiors were shot later in Pinewood Studios, {{as well as}} the ship's explosion, which was done with a miniature in Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage. On 15 September principal photography started on <b>Corfu</b> at the Villa Sylva at Kanoni, above <b>Corfu</b> Town, which acted as the location of the Spanish villa. Many of the local houses were painted white for scenographic reasons. Glen opted to use the local slopes and olive trees for the chase scene between Melina's Citroën 2CV and Gonzales' men driving Peugeot 504s. The scene was shot across twelve days, with stunt driver Rémy Julienne – who would remain in the series up until GoldenEye – driving the Citroën. Four 2CVs were used, with modifications for the stunts – all had more powerful flat-four engines, and one received a special revolving plate on its roof so it could get turned upside down.|$|E
5|$|The Albanian state led also {{efforts to}} {{establish}} an independent orthodox church, contrary to {{the provisions of the}} Protocol of <b>Corfu</b> and thereby reducing the influence of Greek language in the region. According to a 1923 law, priests who were not Albanian speakers, as well as not of Albanian origin, were excluded from this new autocephalous church.|$|E
5|$|The Protocol of <b>Corfu</b> {{is often}} {{mentioned}} by Northern Epirote {{and human rights}} organizations when referring to the discrimination against the Greek minority in Albania. On the other hand, in Albanian historiography this agreement is scarcely mentioned or its interpretation is often grounded on different positions: {{it is seen as}} an attempt to divide the Albanian state and as a proof of the Great Powers' disregard for the national integrity of Albania.|$|E
5|$|The navy {{enjoyed a}} major {{comeback}} under the ambitious emperor Manuel I Komnenos (1143–1180), who used it extensively {{as a powerful}} tool of foreign policy in his relations with the Latin and Muslim states of the Eastern Mediterranean. During {{the early years of}} his reign, the Byzantine naval forces were still weak: in 1147, the fleet of Roger II of Sicily under George of Antioch was able to raid <b>Corfu,</b> the Ionian islands and into the Aegean almost unopposed. In the next year, with Venetian aid, an army accompanied by a very large fleet (allegedly 500 warships and 1,000 transports) was sent to recapture <b>Corfu</b> and the Ionian Islands from the Normans. In retaliation, a Norman fleet of 40 ships reached Constantinople itself, demonstrating in the Bosporus off the Great Palace and raiding its suburbs. On its return voyage however it was attacked and destroyed by a Byzantine or Venetian fleet.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), the {{subsequent}} peace treaties ceded the region to Albania. This turn of events catalyzed an uprising among the local Greeks, which led to the Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence, on February 28, 1914. The International Commission of Control, an organization responsible for securing peace and stability in the region, eventually intervened and the Protocol of <b>Corfu</b> was signed on May 17, 1914. However the protocol’s terms were never implemented because of the politically unstable situation in Albania following the outbreak of World War I, and it was eventually annulled in 1921 during the Conference of Ambassadors.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Marceau was converted into a floating workshop to support torpedo boats and submarines. She was initially based in Malta, but was later moved to <b>Corfu</b> and then to Bizerte in 1918. She was stricken from the naval register on 1 October 1920, and sold to a shipbreaking firm based in Toulon in 1921. While she was being towed to Toulon, a storm caused her to run aground off Bizerte. She remained visible there until the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Caio Duilio {{only went}} on four patrols during the war, and was {{operational}} {{for a total}} of 70 hours. She was based at Taranto starting in November 1918 to April 1919, but during that time, she deployed to <b>Corfu,</b> from 10 November 1918 to 26 January 1919. On 26 April 1919, Caio Duilio was sent to Smyrna to help mediate a dispute over ownership of the area. While there, she had a confrontation with the Greek armored cruiser , but this was defused when the Greeks landed troops to occupy Smyrna. On 9 June, she was relieved by the old pre-dreadnought battleship , allowing her to move to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|As the Russians withdrew, the French {{immediately}} despatched garrisons to the Ionian Islands, rapidly amassing over 7,400 French and Neapolitan {{troops on}} <b>Corfu</b> alone. This effectively turned the Adriatic into a sheltered French sea {{from which they}} could be free to despatch raiders against British convoys, colonies and Royal Navy blockade squadrons, which had controlled the Mediterranean since the Battle of Trafalgar two years earlier. To facilitate this, the French Navy placed significant orders at the Venetian naval yards, intending to build forces in the region with locally produced and crewed vessels.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} outset of his reign, Alexios {{had to meet}} the {{formidable}} threat of the Normans under Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemond of Taranto, who took Dyrrhachium and <b>Corfu,</b> and laid siege to Larissa in Thessaly (see Battle of Dyrrhachium). Alexios led his forces in person against the Normans, yet despite his best efforts his army was destroyed in the field. Alexios himself was wounded, but the death of Robert Guiscard in 1085 led to the Norman danger receding for a time.|$|E
5|$|Bretagne {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arsenal de Brest on 1 July 1912, {{launched}} on 21 April 1913, and completed in September 1915. She was commissioned into the French Navy on 10 February 1916. After entering service in 1916, Bretagne and her sisters {{were assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, their unit {{for the remainder of the}} war, Bretagne becoming flagship of the squadron. They spent the majority of their time at <b>Corfu</b> to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic. The fleet's presence was also intended to intimidate Greece, which had become increasingly hostile to the Triple Entente. Later in the war, men were drawn from their crews for anti-submarine warfare vessels. As the Austro-Hungarians largely remained in port for the duration of the war, Bretagne saw no action during the conflict. Indeed, she did not leave port at all for the entirety of 1917, due to a severe shortage of coal at <b>Corfu.</b> Around July 1918, the ship's foremast was replaced by a tripod foremast that mounted an experimental fire-control director and her mainmast was shortened to allow the ship to fly a captive kite balloon. Bretagne returned to Toulon in November 1918.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Nelson {{departed}} Alexandria, his {{first set of}} dispatches were already in French hands. Leander had been discovered off the western coast of Crete on 18 August 1798 by the French ship of the line Généreux, one of Villeneuve's escapees. After separating from Villeneuve's squadron on 17 August, Généreux was sailing to <b>Corfu</b> when it encountered the British fourth rate. The larger French ship soon overtook the British vessel and a heated exchange followed: French efforts to board Leander were driven back with heavy casualties, and Captain Thompson at one stage successfully raked his opponent, but gradually the heavier weight of Généreux inflicted severe damage to the British ship and after {{six and a half}} hours Thompson was forced to surrender. French captain Lejoille then authorised widespread looting of the personal effects of the British crew, whom he also forced to conduct repairs on both ships, an act against the established conventions of naval warfare. The prize was towed to <b>Corfu</b> for repairs, the two battered vessels briefly encountering Mutine, which escaped to the westwards before Généreux could give chase. In captivity Lejoille continued to refuse to allow the British officers medical attention or return their stolen property. Eventually returned to Britain, Thompson and Berry were knighted and heavily praised for their defence of their ship against heavy odds, while Lejoille was also commended for his success, assisted by his incorrect account of the battle published in French newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Conte di Cavour was {{the name}} ship of the three s built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1910s. She served during both World War I and World War II, {{although}} she was little used and saw no combat during the former. The ship supported operations during the <b>Corfu</b> Incident in 1923 and {{spent much of the}} rest of the decade in reserve. She was rebuilt between 1933 and 1937 with more powerful guns, additional armor and considerably more speed than before.|$|E
5|$|Despite her out-dated design, Démocratie {{served with}} the French Mediterranean Fleet {{throughout}} her career, including during World War I. She participated in the Battle of Antivari in late August 1914, and spent {{the majority of the}} war based on the coast of Greece, in <b>Corfu</b> and Mudros, to keep the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman navies bottled up in port, though she saw no further action. After the end of the war, she went into the Black Sea to assist in the enforcement of the terms of the Armistice with Germany. Démocratie was stricken in 1921 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Eldred {{arrived in}} Italy in July 1918 and {{eventually}} at Sub Chaser Base 25, located in <b>Corfu,</b> Greece in September 1918. There {{he served as}} a machinist aboard submarine chaser SC-244, where they patrolled the Strait of Otranto and were engaged in combat. While in <b>Corfu,</b> Eldred and many others got sick with the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic. The conditions at the hospital were so bad that he had to crawl to a stream to get water, which resulted in a permanent scar on his left hip. Eldred began his return to the United States and arrived in Malta on December 25, 1918. By February 1919, he was in Gibraltar. He was given the option of staying in the Navy until they arrived home in six months or being discharged and paying his own way home. He elected the discharge and was separated from the Navy on March 4, 1919. He met some U.S. Army soldiers who were en route to America aboard an Army troop ship. They took him aboard as a stowaway and loaned him an Army uniform. Eldred slept in a life boat {{on the way back to}} America.|$|E
5|$|From the Albanian perspective, adopted also by Italian and Austrian {{sources of}} that time, the Northern Epirote {{movement}} was directly {{supported by the}} Greek state, {{with the help of}} a minority of inhabitants in the region, resulting in chaos and political instability in all of Albania. In Albanian historiography, the Protocol of <b>Corfu</b> is either scarcely mentioned or seen as an attempt to divide the Albanian state and proof of the Great Powers' disregard for Albania's national integrity.|$|E
