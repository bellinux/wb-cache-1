40|$|A Distributed Switch {{is a set}} of FCDFs {{associated}} with at least one <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch,</b> that controls the operations of the set of FCDFs. Figure 42 shows an example of Distributed Switch composed of a <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> and two FCDFs. From an external point of view (i. e., outside the dotted and dashed black line in figure 42), a Distribut-ed Switch behaves as a Fibre Channel Switch. In particular, a Distributed Switch supports the instan-tiation of N_Port to F_Port links and of E_Port to E_Port links (ISLs). N_Port to F_Port links are supported by both FCDFs and Controlling Switches, while ISLs are supported only by Controlling Switches. This means {{that it is possible to}} connect a Distributed Switch to another Switch only through a <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch,</b> not through an FCDF. From an internal point of view (i. e., inside the dotted and dashed black line in figure 42), A_Port to A_Port links (ASLs) enable FC frames forwarding between <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> and FCDFs, as well as between FCDFs. ASLs are also used to exchange control information between <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> and FCDFs. The <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> uses one or more Virtual Domain_IDs Domain_ID to perform N_Port_ID allo-cations for N_Ports connected to the FCDF Set FCDFs of the Distributed Switch (i. e., a Virtual Domain_ID is used as the most significant byte in the N_Port_IDs allocated to N_Ports that are at-tached to an FCDF of the FCDF SetDistributed Switch). The <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> uses also another Domain_ID, called Principal Domain, for its normal functions as a Fibre Channel Switch. As a result, a Distributed Switch such as the one shown in figure 42 uses at least two Domain_IDs: one for the Principal Domain and one or more for the Virtual Domain.

40|$|Abstract: A new storage structure, {{called a}} uniform ladder, {{consists}} of a linear array of equal shift-register loops, each holding one record and linked by flow-steering switches. Data exchange across a loop boundary is mandatory if the <b>controlling</b> <b>switch</b> is on and forbidden if off. For MRU (Most Recently Used) storage management, the most important operation is the climbing of data {{to the top of}} the ladder from a depth of D loops, which takes only (D + 1) / 2 record periods in the uniform ladder. Program switching is en-hanced by efficient schemes for partial environmental exchanges and also by internal block transfers.

40|$|There face {{challenges}} to build power management circuit for microscale electrostatic vibration energy harvesting. Small capacitance variation limited by standard fabrication {{process is a}} common obstacle to obtain suﬃcient transduction for power conversion. The electronic circuit encounters an issue of compatibility to MEMS integration based on available techniques. A key function of the built interface circuit is able to drive and to power the whole system with only power extracted from ambient vibration. Thus, the energy harvesting system becomes completely autonomous without using any extra suppliers or biases. This work is to build an ASIC interface circuit for the MEMS electrostatic energy harvester where range of transducer capacitance is below∼ 10 pF. The designed circuit is therefore proper for typical comb-drive overlapping capacitive transducers. The circuit topology consists of three main elements: double charge pump, ﬂyback path and <b>controlling</b> <b>switch.</b> Among them, the switch plays an extremely important role to control the harvesting system. Optimization of switching sequence has signiﬁcant eﬀect on harvested power from electrostatic transducer. A control circuit is proposed to detect moments and then to turn on/oﬀ switch optimally. As a result, the designed circuit is automatic to control the switch during vibration cycles. To be the selfsustaining system, the circuit draws obtained energy stored in reservoir capacitor to power the entire interface circuit. With the current topology including clocking, a net energy of 7. 97 nJ is achieved during 1 second when capacitance variation of the transducer has Cmin = 2. 156 pF and Cmax = 8. 624 pF. Alternatively, a voltage-quadrupler circuit topology {{is designed to be}} adaptive to the comb-drive overlapping capacitive transducers. A major advantage of this self-sustaining conﬁguration is that by integration of transducer to series-connected rectiﬁer-capacitor combination, output voltage is boosted to inﬁnite value in principle. For example, with an initial voltage 3 V applied for transducer with nominal capacitance of 30 pF, the obtained voltage ramps up to about 14 V after only 40 ms...|$|E

40|$|In the dimmers {{and motor}} driving apperatuses, AC <b>control</b> <b>switches</b> {{consisting}} of thyristor are generally used {{in order to}} control the AC power of load. Those <b>switches</b> <b>control</b> the load voltage by adjusting the firing angle of thyristor, so the equivalent power factor considered as the difference between source voltage and load current are more lagging than that of preadjusting in spite of load characteristic. And the larger the firing angle, the lagger the equivalent power factor. But if we can control the AC power by adjusting not only the firing angle but also the extinction angle of thyristor, this defect is improved regardless of load characteristic.
