40|$|September 1997 The rapid {{internationalization}} {{of capital}} markets {{in recent times}} has manifested itself in mobility of equity investment {{as well as in}} a growing number of foreign crosslistings. The classic argument is that foreign listings lead to a lower cost of capital because they help overcome the segmentation of the local equity market. Firms obtain a broader investor base which accepts a lower rate of return by diversifying firm specific and country specific risks, which may be priced in a small market. Another financial reason to list abroad may be to establish an international reputation which enables the firm to use shares for employee stock-owner plans for their foreign personnel or to pay for foreign acquisitions. All these arguments suggest that the cost of financing is different across listing countries. There may be different causes for such differences. While for the trading of employee shares transaction costs may be significant, in general asymmetric information costs (such as adverse selection) or agency costs (due to differential enforcement costs) must be different depending on the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>listing.</b> This may lead firms to choose, for instance, listing in countries which are either more transparent (in order to overcom...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the prevalence of two significant impression management strategies, thematic and reading ease manipulation, across a range of distinct corporate communications and explore the determinants of such practices. While previous studies have examined thematic and reading ease manipulation, these have viewed such impression management techniques in isolation. This research is the first to simultaneously examine the prevalence of these impression management strategies across such a range of corporate communications. In particular, no previous studies have looked at the thematic and reading ease manipulation of standalone CSR reports or compared the various sections/disclosures included within the same annual report. Of significance are the inclusion of several additional themes, namely Activity; Optimism; Certainty; Realism and Commonality, advancing the scope of thematic manipulation research from the limited positive and negative themes. It is important to examine a range of correspondence because no one form of correspondence is the same. Financial notes are heavily regulated and audited and thus should be less susceptible to manipulation. CSR disclosures have little to no regulation or audit process and as such are very susceptible to manipulation. Likewise, the two distinct reports service different audiences, who can be expected to have different expertise. This research discovers what firm characteristics are determinates of the readability and thematic content in particular specific disclosure types, industries and <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>listing.</b> Financial performance tests reveal that there is evidence of manipulation of readability to obfuscate the disclosures of poor performing companies while the themes of these poorly performing companyâ€™s disclosures closely mirror those that are performing well. In addition to the traditional performance based tests, a novel new test that combines the traditional thematic positivity variable and readability shows that positive disclosures are significantly more readable than negative ones, strengthening the obfuscation hypothesis. This research also motivates the need of a purpose built reading ease formula based on corporate disclosures that outputs a result that allows the comparison of disclosures. Indeed a very basic example of such a formula is developed as a starting point for additional research...|$|E
