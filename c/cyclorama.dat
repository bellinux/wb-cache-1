5|$|A <b>cyclorama</b> {{painting}} by the French artist Paul Philippoteaux entitled The Battle of Gettysburg, {{also known as}} the Gettysburg <b>Cyclorama,</b> depicts Pickett's Charge {{from the vantage point of}} the Union defenders on Cemetery Ridge. Completed and first exhibited in 1883, it is one of the last surviving cycloramas in the United States. It was restored and relocated to the new National Park Service Visitor Center in September 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Gettysburg, {{also known}} as the Gettysburg <b>Cyclorama,</b> is a <b>cyclorama</b> {{painting}} by the French artist Paul Philippoteaux depicting Pickett's Charge, the climactic Confederate attack on the Union forces during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 3, 1863. Four versions were painted, two of which are among the last surviving cycloramas in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago {{exhibition}} was sufficiently successful to prompt businessman Charles L. Willoughby to commission a second version, {{which opened in}} Boston, Massachusetts, on December 22, 1884. From its opening until 1892, approximately 200,000 people viewed the painting. The Boston version was housed in a specially designed building, the <b>Cyclorama</b> Building, on Tremont Street, and {{was the site of}} popular public lectures on the battle. Two additional copies of the <b>cyclorama</b> were made: the third was first exhibited in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, beginning in February 1886 and a fourth debuted in Brooklyn, New York, in October 1886.|$|E
50|$|Hundreds of <b>cycloramas</b> were produced; however, {{only about}} thirty survive.|$|R
50|$|Pál Vágó (6 June 1853, Jászapáti - 15 October 1928, Budapest) was a Hungarian painter, {{known for}} his {{historical}} scenes and <b>cycloramas.</b>|$|R
50|$|In March 2012, Mayor Michael Bloomberg {{unveiled}} {{five new}} sound stages (a total of 30500 sq ft) at Steiner Studios. The new sound stages all feature {{two or three}} wall <b>cycloramas.</b>|$|R
5|$|On September 3, 1912, {{ground was}} broken {{for a new}} <b>cyclorama</b> {{building}} on Baltimore Street in Gettysburg, on Cemetery Hill (on {{the site of the}} present day Holiday Inn), near the entrance to the Soldiers' National Cemetery. It opened to the public in 1913, in time for the 50th anniversary of the battle, once again displayed as a full circular painting, rather than in sections. The unheated, leaky brick building took a further toll on the condition of the painting. The Boston <b>cyclorama</b> was purchased by the National Park Service in 1942, and moved to a site on Ziegler's Grove near the new Visitor's Center in 1961, after a second round of restoration.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Atlanta {{ranked among}} the fifty largest cities in the United States. The {{battlefield}} is now urban, residential, and commercial land, with many markers memorializing notable events of the battle, including McPherson's place of death. The marker was erected in 1956 by the Georgia Historical Commission. To commemorate the 140th anniversary of the battle, in 2004, two new markers were erected in the Inman Park neighborhood. The Atlanta <b>Cyclorama</b> building, built in 1921 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is a museum located in Grant Park containing a panoramic painting of the battle.|$|E
5|$|The barren desert {{surface of}} Ceti Alpha V was {{simulated}} on stage 8, the largest sound stage at Paramount's studio. The set was elevated 25 {{feet off the}} ground and covered in wooden mats, over which tons of colored sand and powder were dumped. A <b>cyclorama</b> was painted and wrapped around the set, while massive industrial fans created a sandstorm. The filming was uncomfortable for actors and crew alike. The spandex environmental suits Koenig and Winfield wore were unventilated, and the actors had to signal by microphone when they needed air. Filming equipment was wrapped in plastic to prevent mechanical troubles and everyone on set wore boots, masks, and coveralls as protection from flying sand.|$|E
5000|$|Iles {{was part}} of an Anglo-American syndicate, European Amusement Parks Ltd., which brought Luna Parks to Britain and Europe from around 1907. His {{business}} partners were Frank C. Bostock, a circus owner; H. C. McGarvie, an experienced showman [...] "who probably had more experience in international expositions than any other living human being"; and McGarvie's business partner Joseph Menchen, {{who had been in the}} seaside and trolley park entertainment business since 1899. He had constructed <b>cycloramas</b> based on the Johnstown Flood of 1889, and furnished the complex electrical lighting effects for the 'Trip to the Moon' and other <b>cycloramas</b> at Coney Island.|$|R
50|$|Peroni S.p.A. is {{a company}} {{headquartered}} in Gallarate, Italy. Peroni is an Italian brand that is worldwide known by theatrical productions because of its manufacturing of <b>cycloramas,</b> theater drapes and stage curtains and other materials for scenography.|$|R
50|$|Although {{it is most}} {{commonly}} used in the motion picture industry, early sources list duvetyne as a common fabric for dresses, suits, and coats. By the 1930s, however, it was widely noted for its use in constructing theatrical <b>cycloramas</b> and theater curtains.|$|R
5|$|The {{first version}} of the painting, {{completed}} in 1883 and originally exhibited in Chicago, was lost for some time. It was rediscovered in 1965 and purchased {{by a group of}} North Carolina investors in 2007 for an undisclosed amount. Until November 2005, the second painting, originally exhibited in the <b>Cyclorama</b> Building in Boston, was on display at the Gettysburg National Military Park. It was removed for restoration work and the exhibition was reopened September 2008 in the new Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center. The third version, exhibited in Philadelphia, is known to have been destroyed. The location of the fourth version, originally exhibited in Brooklyn, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Chicago work {{went on a}} tour {{of eight}} cities before returning to Chicago in 1933 where it was displayed at the World's Fair. It was in a warehouse until it was purchased by Winston-Salem, North Carolina, artist and collector Joseph Wallace King in 1965. King had first seen the painting in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair. Years later he described the painting and how magnificent it was seeing it displayed in Chicago to his friend Ed Grout of Maryland. Mr. Grout arranged a meeting with the nephew of George McConnel and the painting was purchased by Mr. King. King appeared on the panel game show I've Got A Secret on May 30, 1966, displaying a 22' by 25' section of the painting (his secret was that this was only part of the painting). It was revealed that King had been searching for it for some time, and now that he'd found it, he hoped to construct a new <b>cyclorama</b> building.|$|E
25|$|In February 2013 the {{landmark}} modernist <b>Cyclorama</b> Building and Visitor Center, designed by renowned architect Richard Neutra, was destroyed. The 19th century Gettysburg <b>Cyclorama</b> depicting the battlefield {{had previously been}} removed for restoration, and was reinstalled in the new rustic style Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} at Maidstone Manor Farm, Berkeley County, West Virginia. He entered the Maryland Institute at age 14, then {{attended}} the Royal Academy in Munich. He returned to the United States after twelve years abroad and worked painting <b>cycloramas</b> and as a magazine illustrator. He married twice, and fathered William Colston Leigh, Sr. (1901-1992).|$|R
50|$|CycloMedia is a Dutch company specialising in the {{large-scale}} and systematic visualisation of environments based on 360° panoramic photographs (<b>Cycloramas).</b> Using specialised technology, large public areas are photographed {{and stored in}} an online database. Overlapping panoramic images are captured at 5-meter intervals from public roads at street level, with the camera system mounted on a moving car.|$|R
5000|$|LED {{instruments}} can {{and have}} been used to replace any conventional lighting fixture, and some shows, such as Radiohead's 2008 tour, have used only LED lighting instruments. [...] However, most shows use LEDs only for lighting <b>cycloramas,</b> or as top, side or back light. They can also be used as 'audience blinders' (lights pointed directly at the audience from a low angle).|$|R
25|$|Strip lights, {{also known}} as <b>cyclorama</b> or cyc lights (thus named because they are {{effective}} for lighting the <b>cyclorama,</b> a curtain {{at the back of}} the stage), border lights, and codas (by the brand name), are long housings typically containing multiple lamps arranged along the length of the instrument and emitting light perpendicular to its length. Lamps are often covered with gels of multiple colors (often red, green, and blue, which, in theory, allow almost any color to be mixed) with each color controlled by a separate electrical dimmer circuit. Many striplights use round pieces of glass (called roundels) rather than plastic gels for color. Roundels can sustain heavy use for a long time without fading and are often found in more permanent installations.|$|E
25|$|The Ohio Monument {{dedicated}} to Andrews' Raiders {{is located at}} the Chattanooga National Cemetery. There is a scale model of the General on top of the monument, and a brief history of the Great Locomotive Chase. The General is now in the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History, Kennesaw, Georgia, while the Texas is on display at the Atlanta <b>Cyclorama.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{extraordinary}} <b>cyclorama</b> in {{the background}} was the largest backing ever used on a sound stage. It included models of the Empire State and the Chrysler buildings. Numerous chimneys smoke, lights come on in buildings, neon signs light up, and the sunset slowly unfolds as the movie progresses. Within {{the course of the}} film the clouds—made of spun glass—change position and shape eight times.|$|E
40|$|The use {{of digital}} {{panoramic}} imagery in processes at municipal and cadastral authorities has become common {{over the last}} decade. Applications are found among situational awareness, inventory of public areas, real estate valuation, assessment of permits and inspecting security risks. More and more the imagery is being used for measuring and map making. To enhance the quality and effectiveness of the applications and to improve the user friendliness of measuring and map making, a new dimension {{has been added to}} the panoramic images: the 3 rd dimension. The principle and process behind these so-called Depth <b>Cycloramas</b> is briefly explained and their possibilities in municipal practice are demonstrated. Differences with the employment of LiDAR point clouds concerning precision and possibilities are detailed. Attention is paid to the excellent possibilities offered by Depth <b>Cycloramas</b> for projecting 2 D and 3 D maps and designs, for stereo viewing and for deriving detailed 3 D information of object geometry and object texture...|$|R
25|$|LED {{instruments}} can {{and have}} been used to replace any conventional lighting fixture, and some shows, such as Radiohead's recent tour, have used only LED lighting instruments. Most shows use LEDs only for lighting <b>cycloramas,</b> or as top, side, or back light due to their low throw distance. They can also be used as audience blinders (lights pointed directly at the audience from a low angle).|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the International Panorama Council is to stimulate {{worldwide}} research and communication about existing and future panoramas and <b>cycloramas,</b> advocate for and help preserve the few surviving heritage panoramas, and promote professional affiliation. IPC serves as a bridge connecting the heritage era of the panorama art form to its contemporary and future manifestations, and strives to facilitate the formal international recognition and protection of panoramas by organizations like UNESCO and the Council of Europe.The International Panorama Council actively supports the preservation of historical panoramas and <b>cycloramas.</b> In 2007 and 2008 it started a lobbying campaign to save the endangered panorama painting and building [...] in Innsbruck, Austria.An initiative was taken to support {{the protection of the}} endangered Panorama Mesdag.A further goal of the IPC is to have the most important historical panoramas from 19c. enrolled as UNESCO World Heritage sites. A first step has been taken in July 2008 when the Waterloo Panorama was added to Belgium's tentative proposal for the UNESCO list. In February 2009 Panorama Mesdag applied for inclusion in the tentative list of the Netherlands.|$|R
25|$|The {{opening of}} samad is {{the gap in}} the housing from where the beam of light is {{intended}} to come. Many fixtures use a lens to help control the beam of light, though some, such as border or <b>cyclorama</b> lights, do not have any lenses or optics other than the reflector. The lens and the reflector, along with other beam-altering devices are both considered part of the optics system.|$|E
25|$|The album, which {{consists}} of a mix of contemporary classical idioms which gradually present an unfolding story, like a <b>cyclorama</b> (the panoramic backdrop used in film and theatre), was recorded at the Church of Saint Jude-on-the-Hill, Hampstead Garden Suburb, London, noted for its haunting acoustics. The church has been the chosen venue for many important recordings of film and concert music including the Chandos Records re-recordings of William Walton’s scores for Laurence Olivier's Shakespeare films, performed by The Orchestra and Chorus of The Academy of St Martin in the Fields and conducted by Neville Marriner, on which Goldstein worked as an assistant orchestrator.|$|E
25|$|In the two {{monochrome}} seasons, Reeves was occasionally {{filmed in}} front of aerial footage on back-projection screen, or against a neutral background which would provide a matte which would be optically combined with a swish-pan or aerial shot. That footage was matted onto various backgrounds depending {{on the needs of}} the episode: clouds, buildings, the ocean, mountain forests, etc., which he would appear to fly by. For the color episodes, the simpler and cheaper technique of a neutral <b>cyclorama</b> backing was used, usually sky-blue, or black for night shots. Techniques for landings involved Reeves jumping off a ladder or holding an off-camera horizontal bar and swinging down into frame.|$|E
25|$|In March 1881 Beverly {{provided}} the scenery for Michael Strogoff (Henry James Byron) at the Adelphi Theatre. In this play still-life accessories were, {{for the first}} time on the British stage, harmonised with the background, after the manner of the French <b>cycloramas.</b> At the same house in March 1883 he painted for the Storm-beaten of Robert Williams Buchanan, and in the October following for the opera of Rip Van Winkle at the Royal Comedy Theatre.|$|R
40|$|Mimi Colligan's "Canvas Documentaries" {{takes us}} {{on a tour}} of the <b>cycloramas</b> and various other forms of 'panoramic entertainments' that proliferated during the second half of the nineteenth century. It is beautifully {{designed}} and richly illustrated, and will become a standard reference for anyone with a serious interest in popular entertainment, urban history, adult education, the development of documentary and news media, or indeed just about any area of the visual arts from photography through to sculpture and 'sound and light' shows. In particular, "Canvas Documentaries" should prompt a rewrite of the standard histories of the cinema...|$|R
5000|$|Barker's Panorama was hugely {{successful}} and spawned {{a series of}} [...] "immersive" [...] panoramas: the Museum of London's curators found mention of 126 panoramas that were exhibited between 1793 and 1863. In Europe, panoramas were created of historical events and battles, notably by the Russian painter Franz Roubaud. Most major European cities featured more than one purpose-built structure hosting panoramas. These large fixed-circle panoramas declined in popularity in the latter third of the nineteenth century, though in the United States they experienced a partial revival; in this period, they were more {{commonly referred to as}} <b>cycloramas.</b>|$|R
25|$|Goldstein is a highly-awarded classically trained {{composer}} with prolific credits in film, TV and advertising. He {{began his}} career in theatre, at the Royal Shakespeare Company and Royal National Theatre, working with acclaimed directors including Trevor Nunn and Sir Peter Hall. Later, he began his screen career assisting on numerous important film score orchestrations including Cape Fear, directed by Martin Scorcese, and landmark re-orchestrations of classic film scores including Taxi Driver, performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Jonathan’s debut classical album, <b>Cyclorama,</b> was released worldwide to critical acclaim on the Brilliant Classics label and performed by The Balanescu Quartet and ensemble. In 2013, Jonathan’s Christmas hit, Magical Moments, reached No.1 in the Official UK Classical Charts where it stayed for three weeks over Christmas, ahead of J. S. Bach.|$|E
25|$|Most {{theatrical}} lamps are tungsten-halogen (or quartz-halogen), {{an improvement}} {{on the original}} incandescent design that used halogen gas instead of an inert gas. Fluorescent lights are rarely used other than as work lights (see below). Although they are far more efficient, they cannot be dimmed (run at less than full power) without using specialized dimmers, cannot dim to very low levels, do not produce light from a single point or easily concentrated area, and have a warm-up period during which they emit no light or do so intermittently. High-intensity discharge lamps (or HID lamps) are now common where a very bright light output is required, for example in large follow spots, HMI (hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide) floods, and modern automated fixtures. Because these types of lamps cannot be electrically dimmed, dimming is done by mechanical dousers or shutters that physically block portions of the lamp to decrease output. Some specially-designed fittings now use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a light source. LEDs are ideal where an intense but unfocused light source is required, such as for lighting a <b>cyclorama.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1891, the Boston <b>cyclorama,</b> {{housed in}} the <b>Cyclorama</b> Building, was {{exchanged}} temporarily with the <b>cyclorama</b> Crucifixion of Christ in Philadelphia. When it returned in 1892, it was stored in a [...] crate behind the exhibition hall, where it was subjected to damage from weather, vandals removing boards from the crate, and two fires. It was eventually purchased in its deteriorated state by Albert J. Hahne of Newark, New Jersey, in 1910. Hahne displayed sections of the <b>cyclorama</b> in his department store in Newark beginning in 1911, and sections were also shown in government buildings in New York City, Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. In the Baltimore exhibition, George E. Pickett's widow, [...] "Sallie" [...] Pickett, lectured on her husband's experiences and found herself very moved by the experience.|$|E
50|$|Skypans are {{available}} in different densities. Skypans of around 5,000 Watts can provide soft fill light for backdrops and <b>cycloramas</b> (cycs) in television, film and still photography. Skypans of around 10,000 Watts provide soft and even fill light for large backdrops and cycs, while ones rated up to 20,000 Watts would be more suitable for extremely large cycs. Softer fill light can be provided by adding diffusers. Generally, only two accessories are {{used in conjunction with}} the skypan; metal skirts that can be attached to the skypan to direct the spill of light, and gel frames.|$|R
50|$|Bennett also innovated {{in the way}} he printed pictures, {{building}} a revolving solar printing house that is now housed at the Smithsonian Institution. In addition, because early cameras were unable to accurately capture details of the sky or reflections in water after being adjusted for the light of a typical land photograph, Bennett wove together negatives from multiple photographs of land, sky and water before creating a final print. Bennett received much attention for his advanced techniques, and was commissioned by the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad to photograph the landscape along the company's track in Wisconsin. Bennett also took pictures outside the state, photographing an ice palace in St. Paul, Minnesota and the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Finally, Bennett photographed the huge circular paintings known as <b>cycloramas,</b> publishing sets of stereoviews on the Civil War <b>cycloramas</b> of the Battles of Shiloh, Gettysburg and Missionary Ridge, the engagement between the Monitor and the Virginia, as well as the Crucifixion.As portable film cameras became widespread in the 1890s, Bennett's career declined somewhat because tourists coming to see the Dells were able to take their own souvenir photos and no longer needed Bennett's postcards or portraits. Nevertheless, Bennett pressed on in his profession, selling gift shop type items from his studio to attract more customers and continuing as a professional landscape photographer until his death in 1908. Following his death, Bennett's family took over the photography studio, remodeling it in 1917. His descendants continued to operate the studio until 1999, when the building was restored to its 1908 appearance and became a historic site operated by the Wisconsin Historical Society.|$|R
2500|$|The Portuguese {{audience}} {{was familiar with}} photographic projection, first from <b>cycloramas,</b> dioramas and stereoscopic views and, later, from the magic lantern, with the projection of transparent photographs through a glass plate then coloured. On 28 December 1894, the German photographer Carlos Eisenlohr opened his [...] "Imperial Exhibition" [...] at the galleries of the Avenida Palace Hotel. He presented a novelty to this already knowledgeable Lisbon audience: the live photograph – shown not through an Edison Kinetograph, as announced at the time, but by the Elektrotachyscop or Schnellseher, also called the Electro-Tachiscópio Eisenlohr, an invention by Ottomar Anschutz. The device projected images of actions, of a dog passing by or the galloping of a horse, contained in small disks that produced moving images of extremely short periods.|$|R
