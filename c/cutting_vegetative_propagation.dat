40|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} of cultivated macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia, Macadamia tetraphylla {{and their}} hybrids) worldwide. The susceptibility of the two non-edible Macadamia species (Macadamia ternifolia and Macadamia jansenii) to P. cinnamomi is not well-understood. Commercial macadamia trees are established on grafted seedling (seed propagation) or own-rooted <b>cutting</b> (<b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation)</b> rootstocks of hybrids of the cultivated species. There is little information to support the preferential use of rootstock propagated by either seedling or own-rooted cutting methods in macadamia. In this study we assessed roots of macadamia plants of the four species and their hybrids, derived from the two methods of propagation, for their susceptibility to P. cinnamomi infection. The roots of inoculated plant from which P. cinnamomi was recovered showed blackening symptoms. The non-cultivated species, M. ternifolia and M. jansenii and their hybrids were the most susceptible germplasm compared with M. tetraphylla and M. integrifolia. Of these two species, M. tetraphylla was less susceptible than M. integrifolia. Significant differences were observed among the accessions of their hybrids. A strong association (R > 0. 75) was recorded between symptomatic roots and disease severity. Root density reduced with increasing disease severity rating in both own-rooted cuttings (R = 0. 65) and germinated seedlings (R = 0. 55). P. cinnamomi severity data were not significantly (P > 0. 05) different between the two methods of plant propagation. The significance of this study to macadamia breeding and selection of disease resistant rootstocks is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Skeletonization of binary {{images is}} an {{essential}} step in the inspection of many products, most notably printed circuit boards. It also is used in many other situations, an unusual example being the location of branching points on growing plants for purposes of <b>cutting</b> and <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation.</b> Commercially-available image processing boards typically can’t perform this operation, although they readily perform the easier task of repeated binary erosion. While a single skeletonization step cannot be done in one pass using a 3 x 3 neighborhood, one pass with a 4 x 4 neighborhood suffices. This result has been implemented in custom integrated circuits imbedded in proprietary products, but (to our knowledge) is not commercially available. This paper describes a new pipelined implementation of binary skeletonization which fits easily into the standard SKIPSM (Separated-Kernel Image Processing using finite State Machines) architecture and which can be built using standard ICs costing less than $ 200 total. The same approach also can be implemented in software, providing an order-of-magnitude increase in speed at no extra cost. Furthermore, this same SKIPSM architecture is highly versatile and programmable, allowing it to be software-reconfigured to perform hundreds of other pipelined image processing operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the optimal hormone treatment for rooting in bitter melon and the effect of defoliation on rooting and polyamine levels. Commercial preparation (diluted 1 : 10 and 1 : 20) gave extensive rooting within five days after treatment. The presence of leaf with the stem cutting was necessary for optimal rooting as defoliation drastically reduced rooting even when the rooting time was extended from 5 to 10 days. The presence of leaf also promoted the levels of putrescine three days after the hormone treatment just at the time of root emergence. Cuttings that did not have leaf did not show an increase in putrescine levels and did not produce roots. Spermidine levels also increased in the cuttings that rooted but there was no change in the levels of spermine in the cuttings that rooted. It appears that putrescine and spermidine play a role in regulating rooting in bitter melon <b>cuttings.</b> The <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation</b> conditions described show that it is a practically viable technique for small growers to produce large number of plantlets at the farm for selection and cultivation...|$|R
5000|$|Jatropha curcas {{has limited}} natural <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation</b> {{and is usually}} {{propagated}} by seed.

Low seed viability and the recalcitrant nature of oil seeds also limit seed propagation. However, clonal techniques can help in overcoming these problems that hinder mass propagation of this tree-borne oilseed species. <b>Vegetative</b> <b>propagation</b> has been achieved by stem cuttings, grafting, budding as well as by air layering techniques. [...] The investigation leads to the recommendation that cuttings should be taken preferably from juvenile plants and treated with 200 micro gram per litre of IBA (rooting hormone) to ensure the highest level of rooting in stem <b>cuttings.</b> These <b>vegetative</b> methods have potential for commercial propagation of these plants.|$|R
40|$|Many {{types of}} {{magnetic}} fields {{have already been}} investigated {{in order to find}} new methods to enhance plant growth. This study reports the positive effect of pulsed electromagnetic field on the main root characteristics (fresh weight, dry weight, root surface and length) of unrooted oregano stem <b>cuttings.</b> For oregano, <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation</b> is commonly used, with rooted or unrooted stem cuttings, because seed propagation is not suggested for commercial cultivation. Oregano seeds are very small and, thus, difficult to handle. Vegetative reproduction in organic cultivation faces the ethical problem of the use of hormones to induce the rooting process in propagation beds. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if magnetic field can replace hormones in plant propagation and what the results of the combination of both magnetic field and hormones would be. Two types of stem cuttings were used (apical and middle) and the experiment was established in two different seasons (spring and autumn). The findings showed that magnetic field alone stimulates the rooting process in plant material, with results similar to or even statistically significantly better than those obtained using hormones. However, the combination of magnetic field and hormones resulted in measurements statistically significantly lower than with magnetic field alone. Such methods can potentially be useful for plant materials growers, providing better oregano seedlings, especially in organic farming, where chemical compounds are forbidden...|$|R

30|$|The {{potential}} {{advantage of}} <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation</b> is {{the production of}} true-to-type plants on a sustainable basis, which is clearly not feasible with seeds. However, plants raised through <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation</b> maintain a definite vegetative time period before flowering, due to the physiological age of the mother plant. There is a danger that flowering, and death, could occur soon after propagation (Banik 1985). Therefore, before collecting the propagating material, plant age and relevant physiological details need to be ascertained for each species, noting {{that there may be}} environmental effects which can change this status. Relevant establishment records for the mother plants must be developed and maintained. Widely used <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation</b> methods for bamboo are rhizome or offset cuttings, layering and culm cuttings (Gaur 1985).|$|R
5000|$|In a wide sense, {{methods of}} <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation</b> include <b>cutting,</b> <b>vegetative</b> apomixis, layering, division, budding, {{grafting}} and tissue culture. Cutting {{is the most}} common artificial <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation</b> method, where pieces of the [...] "parent" [...] plant are removed and placed in a suitable environment so that they can grow into a whole new plant, the [...] "clone", which is genetically identical to the parent. Cutting exploits the ability of plants to grow adventitious roots (i.e. root material that can generate from a location other than the existing or primary root system, as in from a leaf or cut stem) under certain conditions.Vegetative propagation is usually considered a cloning method. However, there are several cases where vegetatively propagated plants are not genetically identical. Root cuttings of thornless blackberries will revert to thorny type because the adventitious shoot develops from a cell that is genetically thorny. Thornless blackberry is a chimera, with the epidermal layers genetically thornless but the tissue beneath it genetically thorny. Similarly, leaf cutting propagation of certain chimeral variegated plants, such as snake plant (Sansevieria trifasciata), will produce mainly nonvariegated plants.Grafting is often not a complete cloning method because seedlings are used as rootstocks. In that case only the top of the plant is clonal. In some crops, particularly apples, the rootstocks are vegetatively propagated so the entire graft can be clonal if the scion and rootstock are both clones.Apomixis (including apospory and diplospory) is a type of reproduction that does not involve fertilisation. In flowering plants, unfertilized seeds are involved, or plantlets that grow instead of flowers. Hawkweed (Hieracium), dandelion (Taraxacum), some citrus (Citrus) and many grasses such as Kentucky blue grass (Poa pratensis) all use this form of asexual reproduction. Bulbils are sometimes formed instead of the flowers of garlic.|$|R
