5|$|From {{the work}} of Heaviside (1887) it had become clear that the {{performance}} of telegraph lines, and most especially telephone lines, could be improved {{by the addition of}} inductance to the line. George Campbell at AT implemented this idea (1899) by inserting loading coils at intervals along the line. Campbell found that as well as the desired improvements to the line's characteristics in the passband there was also a definite frequency beyond which signals could not be passed without great attenuation. This was a result of the loading coils and the line capacitance forming a low-pass filter, an effect that is only apparent on lines incorporating lumped components such as the loading coils. This naturally led Campbell (1910) to produce a filter with ladder topology, a glance at the <b>circuit</b> <b>diagram</b> of this filter is enough to see its relationship to a loaded transmission line. The cut-off phenomenon is an undesirable side-effect as far as loaded lines are concerned but for telephone FDM filters it is precisely what is required. For this application, Campbell produced band-pass filters to the same ladder topology by replacing the inductors and capacitors with resonators and anti-resonators respectively. Both the loaded line and FDM were of great benefit economically to AT and this led to fast development of filtering from this point onwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An {{example of this is}} shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the <b>circuit</b> <b>diagram</b> represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an ideal filter response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.|$|E

500|$|Electrical {{systems are}} {{commonly}} described {{by means of}} a <b>circuit</b> <b>diagram.</b> [...] These are network diagrams that describe the topology of the electrical system using a specialised graph notation. [...] The <b>circuit</b> <b>diagram</b> does not try and represent the true physical dimensions of the electrical components or their actual spatial relationship to each other. [...] This is possible because the electrical components are represented as ideal lumped elements, that is, the element is treated as if it is occupying a single point (lumped at that point). [...] Non-ideal components can be accommodated in this model by using more than one element to represent the component. [...] For instance, a coil intended for use as an inductor has resistance as well as inductance. [...] This can be represented on the <b>circuit</b> <b>diagram</b> as a resistor in series with an inductor. [...] Thus, the first step in forming an analogy of a mechanical system is to describe it as a mechanical network in a similar way, that is, as a topological graph of ideal elements. [...] Alternative, more abstract, representations to the <b>circuit</b> <b>diagram</b> are possible, for instance the bond graph.|$|E

[...] The LC ladder network commonly used for low-pass filters can have many elements but is another example of a two-element-kind network.|$|E
500|$|Mechanical-electrical analogies are the {{representation}} of mechanical systems as electrical networks. [...] At first, such analogies were used in reverse to help explain electrical phenomena in familiar mechanical terms. [...] James Clerk Maxwell introduced analogies of this sort in the 19th century.

[...] The eardrum is the transducer between the acoustic waves in air in the ear canal and the mechanical vibrations in the bones of the middle ear. [...] At the cochlea there is another change of medium from mechanical vibrations to the fluid filling the cochlea. [...] This example thus demonstrates the power of electrical analogies in bringing together three domains (acoustic, mechanical and fluid flow) into a single unified whole. If the nerve impulses flowing to the brain had also been included in the model then the electrical domain would have made four domains encompassed in the model.|$|E
