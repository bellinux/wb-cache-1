She has cured a multiplicity of headaches by Squinstone's Eye-snuff; she wears a picture of Hahnemann in her bracelet and a lock of Priessnitz's hair in a brooch. She talked about her own complaints and those of her CONFIDANTE for the time being, to every lady in the room successively, from our hostess down to Miss Wirt, taking them into corners, and whispering about bronchitis, hepatitis, St. Vitus, neuralgia, cephalalgia, and so forth. I observed poor fat Lady Hawbuck in a dreadful alarm after some communication regarding the state of her daughter Miss Lucy Hawbuck's health, and Mrs. Sago turned quite yellow, and put down her third glass of Madeira, at a warning glance from Lady Blanche.|$|E

40|$|Spectrum sensing and {{direction}} of arrival (DOA) estimation have been thoroughly investigated, both separately and as a joint task. Estimating {{the support of a}} set of signals and their DOAs is crucial to many signal processing applications, such as Cognitive Radio (CR). A challenging scenario, faced by CRs, is that of multiband signals, composed of several narrowband transmissions spread over a wide spectrum each with unknown carrier frequencies and DOAs. The Nyquist rate of such signals is high and constitutes a bottleneck both in the analog and digital domains. To alleviate the sampling rate issue, several sub-Nyquist sampling methods, such as multicoset sampling or the modulated wideband converter (MWC), have been proposed in the context of spectrum sensing. In this work, we first suggest an alternative sub-Nyquist sampling and signal reconstruction method to the MWC, based on a uniform linear array (ULA). We then extend our approach to joint spectrum sensing and DOA estimation and propose the <b>CompreSsed</b> CArrier and DOA Estimation (CaSCADE) system, composed of an L-shaped array with two ULAs. In both cases, we derive perfect recovery conditions of the signal parameters (carrier frequencies and DOAs if relevant) and the signal itself and provide two reconstruction algorithms, one based on the ESPRIT method and the second on compressed sensing techniques. Both our joint carriers and DOAs recovery algorithms overcome the well-known pairing issue between the two parameters. Simulations demonstrate that our alternative spectrum sensing system outperforms the MWC in terms of recovery error and design complexity and show joint carrier frequencies and DOAs from our CaSCADE system's sub-Nyquist samples...|$|R

When the Rabi frequency is tuned to resonance with the oscillator the latter can be driven far from equilibrium. Blue detuned driving leads to a population inversion in the qubit and a bi-stability with lasing behavior of the oscillator; for red detuning the qubit cools the oscillator. This behavior persists at the symmetry point where the qubit-oscillator coupling is quadratic and decoherence effects are minimized. There the system realizes a "single-atom-two-photon laser".

Clusters with charge 1 / 2 are identified with merons. At θ = π they are inactive, such that the mass gap vanishes.
