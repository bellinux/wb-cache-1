5|$|Burtt {{had visited}} Niagara Falls in 1987 {{and used his}} {{recordings}} from his trip for the sounds of wind. He ran around a hall with a <b>canvas</b> <b>bag</b> up to record the sandstorm though. For the scene where WALL-E runs from falling shopping carts, Burtt and his daughter went to a supermarket and placed a recorder in their cart. They crashed it around {{the parking lot and}} then let it tumble down a hill. To create Hal (WALL-E's pet cockroach)'s skittering, he recorded the clicking caused by taking apart and reassembling handcuffs.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Abubakar Sadiq Ibrahim, an {{unemployed}} journalist, {{who said he}} wanted to see the daughter who lived with his estranged wife, crashed his Mercedes-Benz into a retaining wall on the span and threatened to explode a bomb. A black <b>canvas</b> <b>bag</b> on his front seat turned out to contain books and clothes.|$|E
25|$|On December 7, 1993, Colin Ferguson {{purchased}} {{a ticket for}} the 5:33p.m. eastbound train at the Atlantic Avenue station in Brooklyn. This train stopped at the Jamaica station in Queens. Ferguson boarded the third car of the eastbound Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) commuter train from Penn Station to Hicksville, along with more than 80 other passengers. Ferguson, who sat on the southwestern end of the car, was carrying his handgun and a <b>canvas</b> <b>bag</b> filled with 160 rounds of ammunition.|$|E

25|$|In 19th century Russia and Scandinavia, pigs {{were used}} as decoys and were transported in strong canvas sacks on horse-drawn sleighs. The pigs, kept in the canvas bags, were made to squeal {{in order to attract}} the wolves. Hunters would wait at a {{distance}} to shoot the wolves when they came out after the pig. Once the wolves arrived, the hunters would either shoot them or retrieve the pig and <b>canvas</b> <b>bag.</b> In the latter case, they took off down the road, luring the wolves behind. The wolves would be led to a palisade, where they would be trapped and shot.|$|E
25|$|With a storm {{continuing}} to blow on the 9th, {{the crew was}} able to lower the level {{of water in the}} hold and plug some of the holes and leaks. Bailing out water using a large improvised <b>canvas</b> <b>bag</b> continued from the 9th to the 13th and succeeded in maintaining the level of water in the hold below three feet. On the 13th they were again hit by a storm and cross seas and had to bail all night. On the 14th, heavy seas disabled the rudder. By the afternoon of 15 December, the Destroyer was to the southwest of Puerto Rico, heading for Martinique, and still weathering storms.|$|E
25|$|The {{perpetrators}} left three {{explosive devices}} connected {{to one another}} at the Inland Regional Center, contained inside the backpack left by Farook during the departmental event. The devices were described as pipe bombs constructed with Christmas lights and tied together, combined with a remote controlled car that was switched on. The poorly constructed devices failed to explode. Authorities believe that the pipe bombs were meant to target the emergency personnel responding to the scene. The device was hidden inside a <b>canvas</b> <b>bag,</b> and its build was similar to schematics published in Al Qaeda's Inspire magazine. Coworkers noticed the bag before the attack occurred, but thought that Farook would return for it and therefore did not investigate it.|$|E

40|$|Trapping and {{handling}} animals {{is an important}} aspect of wildlife research and management. Safety precautions to minimize the risk of injuries to wildlife researchers and animal subjects are mandated by state and federal laws. Use of a modified plastic funnel aided in researcher safety in a study of fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) on the Texas A&M University campus. Plastic funnels used in conjunction with <b>canvas</b> <b>bags</b> prevented animal bites or other injuries and simplified the handling and tagging of 175 fox squirrels. Studies employing the use of <b>canvas</b> <b>bags</b> with zippers for restraining squirrel-sized mammals should use the plastic funnel as an added safety precaution...|$|R

25|$|Rebeca is {{the second}} cousin of Úrsula Iguaran and the {{orphaned}} child of Nicanor Ulloa and his wife Rebeca Montiel. At first she is extremely timid, refuses to speak, and has the habits of eating earth and whitewash from {{the walls of the}} house, a condition known as pica. She arrives carrying a <b>canvas</b> <b>bag</b> containing her parents' bones and seems not to understand or speak Spanish. However, she responds to questions asked by Visitacion and Cataure in the Guajiro or Wayuu language. She falls in love with and marries her adoptive brother José Arcadio after his return from traveling the world. After his mysterious and untimely death, she lives in seclusion {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{protests from}} crewmen, {{who wanted the}} remains hosed over the deck, Callaghan insisted that the young Japanese airman had done his job {{to the best of}} his ability, with honor, and {{deserved}} a military funeral. Stephen Cromwell, a corpsman at the time, later recalled, [...] "I was able to recover his body and I called up to the bridge to ask if I should throw it overboard ... Captain Callaghan said, ‘No, when we secure, take it down to the sick bay, and we'll have a burial for him tomorrow.’" [...] Ivan Dexter, another crew member, gave his account of events to Herb Fahr, recalling that {{the top half of the}} Japanese pilot's body was scattered over the deck, while the bottom half fell with the rest of the plane into the sea. What remained of the body was brought to sick bay for examination, and various Missouri crew took souvenirs from the clothing, including the helmet, scarf, and jacket. Following examination, the remains were placed in a <b>canvas</b> <b>bag</b> with dummy shell casings to weigh it down.|$|E

5000|$|... 10 {{months of}} {{surveillance}} on the brothers revealed the brothers closing {{a deal on}} a gaming arcade but there was insufficient evidence for an arrest warrant so agents focused on determining where the black <b>canvas</b> <b>bags</b> came from. That paid off when one store owner recognised the bags as coming from his company and the special cord which came from a company in Georgia. The owner gave receipts he had left from years of business and after much searching, a receipt for three custom-sized black <b>canvas</b> <b>bags</b> {{was found to have}} been sold to Mark Harris, similar to the taser receipt found during a search of Michael Poland's home months earlier which convinced agents that Mark Harris was an alias for Michael Poland.|$|R
60|$|The ample {{profits of}} this iniquitous {{business}} were divided, between {{all the parties}} concerned in it; Scriggs, the marine, coming in for one third. His cook's mess-chest being brought on deck, four <b>canvas</b> <b>bags</b> of silver were found in it, amounting to a sum something short of as many hundred dollars.|$|R
50|$|Strict {{rules are}} {{enforced}} {{to maintain the}} course's pristine condition such as a prohibition of golf carts and a limit of eight clubs per player. As the course was literally carved out of a mountain, it can be quite demanding and clubs are carried in <b>canvas</b> <b>bags</b> to reduce the strain on caddies.|$|R
2500|$|Horrie, an Egyptian terrier, was befriended as a puppy by Australian soldier Private Jim Moody {{when he was}} {{stationed}} in the Ikingi Maryut area of Egypt in 1941.The dog became the unofficial mascot of Moody's unit, the 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion, and followed them as they moved around the Middle East and Greece during their various campaigns. According to the Australian War Memorial, Horrie was described by his owner as being [...] "intelligent and easily trained", and he was employed as an air sentry, alerting troops to approaching enemy aircraft. He was promoted {{to the rank of}} corporal, and during the evacuation of Greece, Horrie was aboard the troopship Costa Rica when it was sunk. He managed to survive, though, and later made it to Crete when he was subsequently wounded by a bomb blast. In 1942, after further service in Syria as part of the Allied garrison, Horrie was brought back to Australia when Moody was repatriated. In order to get around stringent quarantine laws which would have prevented him from bringing Horrie back, Moody smuggled the dog home in a <b>canvas</b> <b>bag,</b> which was reinforced with wooden slats so that the dog could breathe.|$|E
2500|$|The typical {{structural}} ironworker {{tools are}} the spud wrench, bolt bag, sleever bars, bull pins, drift pins and beaters. The spud wrench {{is the most}} important tool of a structural ironworker because it serves dual purposes. [...] It is a wrench to tighten bolts, and {{the opposite end of the}} wrench can be used to align holes of beams with columns. It is made from a steel alloy, and it has a gradual taper to easily align bolt holes on beams. The bolt bag is a heavy <b>canvas</b> <b>bag</b> used for storing bolts and nuts that erect a structure. A sleever bar is a steel alloy bar used to pry on beams to put them in place, when a spud wrench is insufficient. [...] A beater is forged steel head mallet with a lacquered hickory handle for beating a tapered pin or bull pin into the bolt hole to align the others at the beam end or [...] "point" [...] and stuff the rest of the holes. Drift pins have a tapper on both ends and get to be the largest diameter in the center. Are used for aligning holes made up of multiple plates.|$|E
2500|$|After her arrest, she {{was held}} at an annex to the Old Capitol Prison before being {{transferred}} to the Washington Arsenal on April 30. Two armed guards stood before {{the door to her}} cell from the beginning of her imprisonment until her death. Her cell, while airy and larger than the others, was sparsely furnished, with a straw mattress, table, wash basin, chair, and a bucket. Food was served four times a day, always of bread; salt pork, beef, or beef soup; and coffee or water. The other arrested conspirators had their heads enclosed in a padded <b>canvas</b> <b>bag</b> to prevent a suicide attempt. Sources disagree as to whether Surratt was forced to wear it as well. Although the others wore iron manacles on their feet and ankles, she was not manacled. (Rumors to the contrary were raised by reporters at the trial who could not see her or [...] "heard" [...] the clank of chains about her feet. The rumors were repeatedly investigated and denied.) She began to suffer menstrual bleeding and became weak during her detention. She was given a rocking chair and allowed visits from her daughter, Anna. She and Powell received the most attention from the press. The Northern press was also highly critical of her.|$|E

Following the war most were discharged, but gradually women have increased their presence in executive, managerial, administrative, technical and clerical positions.|$|R
50|$|Recently, tote bags {{have been}} sold as a more {{eco-friendly}} replacement for disposable plastic bags given {{how they can be}} reused multiples times over. However, a study by the UK Environment Agency found that cotton <b>canvas</b> <b>bags</b> have to be reused at least 327 times before they can match the carbon expenditure of a single disposable plastic bag. Meanwhile, tote bags made from recycled polypropylene plastic require 26 reuses to match.|$|R
5000|$|A week or {{so after}} the {{collision}} divers recovered 56 mailboxes, one bag, one parcel, five passengers' boxes, and two cases of merchandise from the wreck.

White Fang whined {{as he watched the}} operation.|$|R
60|$|Vessels for Cooling Water may be {{made that}} shall also act {{efficiently}} as flasks. Porous earthen jars are too brittle for long use, and their pores choke up if slimy water be put inside them. But the Arabs use a porous leather flask, called a Zemsemiya, which is hung on the shady side of the camel, and by evaporation keeps the water deliciously cool: it is a rather wasteful way of carrying water. <b>Canvas</b> <b>bags</b> are equally effective.|$|R
