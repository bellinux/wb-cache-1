5000|$|Nonwovens {{can also}} start with films and fibrillate, serrate or vacuum-form them with {{patterned}} holes. Fiberglass nonwovens are of two basic types. Wet laid mat or [...] "glass tissue" [...] use wet-chopped, heavy denier fibers in the 6 to 20 micrometre diameter range. Flame attenuated mats or [...] "batts" [...] use discontinuous fine denier fibers in the 0.1 to 6 range. The latter is similar, though run at much higher temperatures, to melt-blown thermoplastic nonwovens. Wet laid mat {{is almost always}} wet resin bonded with a <b>curtain</b> <b>coater,</b> while batts are usually spray bonded with wet or dry resin. An unusual process produces polyethylene fibrils in a Freon-like fluid, forming them into a paper-like product and then calendering them to create Tyvek.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of lacquer product application methods used in the furniture industry on emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The air samples for analyses came from three industrial plants, located in Poland, producing case furniture. In each of these plants, the fi nishing process was performed using waterborne lacquer products, but using different types of lacquer application machines and devices: automated finishing lines, automated vertical spray machines, a <b>curtain</b> <b>coater</b> and classical pneumatic spray guns. The compounds found in the air collected for analyses were adsorbed on a Tenax TA synthetic sorbent. The volatile compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry and thermal desorption. The results showed differences in the amounts of identified compounds depending on the type of the used lacquer application machine. It was found out that the use of automated finishing lines for lacquering of furniture elements does not only lead to an increase in the efficiency of the process, but also results in a reduction of pollution in the production halls...|$|E
40|$|In all coating applications, {{a liquid}} film {{displaces}} air {{in contact with}} a dry solid substrate. At a low substrate speed a thin uniform wetting line is formed on the substrates surface, but at a high speed the wetting line becomes segmented and unsteady as air becomes entrained between the substrate and the liquid. These air bubbles {{affect the quality of}} the coated product and any means to postpone this at higher speeds without changing the specifications of the coating liquid is desirable. This research assesses the validity of a theoretically based concept developed by Blake and Rushack [1] and exploited by Cohu and Benkreira [2] for dip coating. The concept suggests that angling the wetting line by an angle ß would increase the speed at which air is entrained by a factor 1 /cos ß. In practice, if achieved this is a significant increase that would result in more economical operation. This concept was tested in a fast coating operation that of curtain coating which is already enhanced by what is known as hydrodynamic assistance [2]. Here we are effectively checking an additional assistance to wetting. The work, performed on a purposed built <b>curtain</b> <b>coater</b> and a rotating die, with a range of fluids showed the concept to hold but provided the data are processed in a way that separate the effect of curtain impingement from the slanting of the wetting line...|$|E
