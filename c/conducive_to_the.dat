5|$|The {{fine-tuned}} Universe is {{the proposition}} that the conditions that allow life in the Universe can only occur when certain universal fundamental physical constants lie within a very narrow range, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the Universe would be unlikely to be <b>conducive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> establishment and development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood. The proposition is discussed among philosophers, scientists, theologians, and proponents of creationism.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Auxois is closely tied to its homeland, {{for which it is}} named. The rich {{pastures}} of the Auxois area, including the French Gold Coast, parts of Yonne, the Saône-et-Loire and northern Nièvre, are <b>conducive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> breeding of large draft horses. The recognition of the Auxois dates back to the early 20th century, making it relatively new compared to other French draft breeds.|$|E
5|$|In the south, {{conditions}} <b>conducive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{spread of}} malaria existed throughout Petén and Belize. At {{the time of}} the fall of Nojpetén in 1697, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war. Likewise, in Tabasco the population of approximately 30,000 was reduced by an estimated 90%, with measles, smallpox, catarrhs, dysentery and fevers being the main culprits.|$|E

5|$|Settlement {{continued}} {{to follow the}} river down the valley. At the confluence with Castle Creek, the valley widened and offered a flood plain <b>conducive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of a town. The slopes of the surrounding mountains proved to have the silver deposits the prospectors had anticipated, and very soon the mining camp became a small city, named Aspen after the trees that filled the surrounding forests. It grew rapidly, becoming {{the seat of the}} newly created Pitkin County, named after the governor its earliest settlers had disobeyed by coming there.|$|E
5|$|Tour {{operators}} {{continue to}} advertise the island as a lost paradise surrounded by mangroves where travellers' exotic dreams come to life, but {{this type of}} discovery tourism is not as popular as traditional beach-related tourism. Thus, visitors from France, Spain, and Italy often combine tours of the cases á impluvium in Enampore or Mlomp with {{a few days of}} relaxation in Carabane. The area is also very <b>conducive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interests of fishing enthusiasts. Along the beach, small stalls offer traditional crafts and clothes at prices lower than those in Cap Skirring or Saly. Badji Malang, a local painter, potter, sculptor, and poet, has created a camp in the area.|$|E
5|$|When Queen Beatrix succeeded {{her mother}} Juliana on the latter's abdication on 30 April 1980, the new queen {{decided to keep}} the holiday on 30 April {{as a tribute to}} her mother. (If 30 April fell on a Sunday, Koninginnedag was {{observed}} the previous day—this occurred most recently in 2006.) The reason was practical as well—Beatrix's actual birthday on 31 January would have been less <b>conducive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traditional outdoor activities. Rather than remaining at the palace and letting the Dutch people come to her, Beatrix instead usually visited two towns each year for Koninginnedag celebrations. Local crafts and customs were demonstrated for the royal family, who had the opportunity to join in.|$|E

5|$|Bapaume {{itself was}} a small town linked by rail to Albert and Arras. There were also four major roads running through the town; running to Albert in the south-west, to Peronne in the south-east; to Cambrai {{in the east and}} to the north lay Arras. Captured by the forces of Imperial Germany {{in the early stages of}} the war, it had been the focus of the British forces on the opening day of the Battle of Somme in 1916. Still in German hands, it had been largely {{destroyed}} in early 1917 following their withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line. Extensive booby traps had also been left and these troubled the Australians that moved into the town afterwards. It was subsequently recaptured by the Germans during the Spring Offensive. The land surrounding Bapaume was relatively flat and thus was <b>conducive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> use of tanks.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of a prion-like domain arises {{from the study of}} fungal prions. In yeast, prionogenic proteins have a portable prion domain that is both necessary and sufficient for self-templating and protein aggregation. This has been shown by attaching the prion domain to a reporter protein, which then aggregates like a known prion. Similarly, removing the prion domain from a fungal prion protein inhibits prionogenesis. This modular view of prion behaviour has led to the hypothesis that similar prion domains are present in animal proteins, in addition to PrP. These fungal prion domains have several characteristic sequence features. They are typically enriched in asparagine, glutamine, tyrosine and glycine residues, with an asparagine bias being particularly <b>conducive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aggregative property of prions. Historically, prionogenesis has been seen as independent of sequence and only dependent on relative residue content. However, this {{has been shown to be}} false, with the spacing of prolines and charged residues having been shown to be critical in amyloid formation.|$|E
5|$|Wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) {{is present}} {{in the center of the}} site and threatens to spread into {{herbaceous}} areas. It compromises sustainability of stations, including man orchid and bee orchid populations. Two distinct zones can be distinguished. The first, where the wood small-reed has a very high rate of recovery, is not hosting any heritage value. It is mowed early and disposed of. Grazing is not possible at the moment. The second, on the contrary, not densely colonized by this plant is much more of a fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle-bearing bush cricket or long-horned groundhopper. Differentiated management is applied depending on the issues. At orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning. The less dense areas where the grass is sparse (<b>conducive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis)) are pulled. In the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion. Finally, dense areas, well exposed, are left in that state.|$|E
