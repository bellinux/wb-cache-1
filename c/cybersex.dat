25|$|The most {{effective}} way to prevent sexual transmission of STIs is to avoid contact of body parts or fluids which can lead to transfer with an infected partner. Not all sexual activities involve contact: <b>cybersex,</b> phonesex or masturbation from a distance are methods of avoiding contact. Proper use of condoms reduces contact and risk. Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{findings}} by Daneback et al. (2005) reported of the 1828 participants they surveyed, {{one third of}} them reported engaging in <b>cybersex</b> and of that one third, 46% said {{they were in a}} committed relationship with someone else. While face to face sexual scripts for individuals of what is acceptable have been readily available, with the creation of the Internet, the rules of what constitutes infidelity are not as clearly established anymore. Yarab, Sensibaugh, & Allgeier (1998) found that couples often expect both sexual and mental exclusivity in their monogamous relationships, suggesting a need for more research in this particular area of infidelity.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{legislation}} has been {{drafted in the}} Philippines despite being met with up to eight petitions filed with the highest court in the Philippines questioning {{the constitutionality of the}} legislation. The Filipino legislation is intended, like the Canadian bill, to prevent <b>cybersex,</b> online child pornography, identity theft, and spamming. However, in addition to these crimes, the Filipino bill also makes libel a cybercrime punishable by up to twelve years. It is generally this last issue that has privacy and right’s groups concerned over the legislation. “It violates Filipinos' rights to free expression and it is wholly incompatible with the Philippine government's obligations under international law,” said Brad Adams, Asia director of US-based Human Rights Watch.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Stern {{signed an}} advance deal with ReganBooks worth around $3 million {{to write his}} second book, Miss America. Stern wrote about various topics, {{including}} his <b>cybersex</b> experiences on the Internet service Prodigy, a private meeting with Michael Jackson, his suffering with back pain and obsessive–compulsive disorder, and his run for Governor of New York. Following its release on November 7, 1995, Miss America sold 33,000 copies at Barnes & Noble stores which set a new one-day record for the chain, and 120,000 in its first week. It entered The New York Times Best-Seller list at number one and stayed on the list for 16 weeks. According to Publishers Weekly, 1.39 million copies were sold in 1995 alone which ranked it the year's third best-selling book. As with Private Parts, Stern's book signings attracted thousands. His November 30, 1995 appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno caused controversy after he appeared on the show with two bikini-clad women who kissed each other and received spanks from Stern. Leno, who urged that both acts would be edited out from the final broadcast, walked off the stage after the segment without thanking Stern.|$|E

2500|$|When {{compared}} with the general population, homosexuality and bisexuality are over-represented in the furry fandom by about a factor of 10. Of the US population, about 1.8% of persons self-identify as bisexual and 1.7% as homosexual according to a 2011 study from scholars at UCLA. In contrast, according to four different surveys 14–25% of the fandom members report homosexuality, 37–52% bisexuality, 28–51% heterosexuality, and 3–8% other forms of alternative sexual relationships. Approximately {{half of the respondents}} reported being in a relationship, of which 76% were in a relationship with another member of furry fandom. Examples of sexual aspects within furry fandom include erotic art and furry-themed <b>cybersex.</b> The term [...] "" [...] is sometimes used to indicate sexual activity or sexual material within the fandom—this applies to sexual activity and interaction within the subculture whether in the form of <b>cybersex</b> or offline.|$|E
2500|$|Other similar {{problems}} arise in other virtual economies. In the game The Sims Online, a 17-year-old boy going by the in-game name [...] "Evangeline" [...] was discovered to {{have built a}} cyber-brothel, where customers would pay sim-money for minutes of <b>cybersex.</b> Maxis canceled each of his accounts, but had he deposited his fortune in the Gaming Open Market {{he would have been}} able to keep a part of it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{possibilities}} for finding a potential mate or lifelong partner has increased {{due to the}} ease {{of being able to}} connect with people all across the world. The proliferation of sex chat rooms has increased the opportunity for people in committed relationships to engage in acts of infidelity on and off the Internet. [...] A cyber affair is defined as [...] "a romantic or sexual relationship initiated by online contact and maintained primarily via online communication" [...] (Young et al., 2000). Sexual acts online include behaviors such as <b>cybersex,</b> where two or more individuals engage in discussions about sexual fantasies over the Internet and is usually accompanied by sexual self-stimulation, , where discussions between two or more people move away from light hearted flirting, and emotional acts where people disclose intimate information to a significant other (Whitty, 2004). A new type of sexual activity online is when two people's avatars engage in sexual activity in virtual reality worlds such The Sims or Second Life. According to a report by Randall & Byers (2003) the majority of Americans believe that if a partner engaged in <b>cybersex</b> this constitutes as an act of infidelity.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for The Village Voice, Vince Aletti praised its [...] "unusu-ally busy, electronica- spiked soundscape," [...] {{revealing}} [...] "the process of psychic reconstruction". Aletti added, [...] "she combines a pure pop sensibility with ambition, vulnerability, freakishness, and extraordinary savvy. She's--in her inadequate word--special". However, Jackson's [...] "isolating control" [...] {{was regarded as}} its [...] "more bracing" [...] material. Entertainment Weekly observed its subject matter of [...] "computer liaisons to bondage and bisexuality", finding the most pervasive theme to be love. Roger Catlin of The Courant noted its aura [...] "washes away her sometimes strident political messages or her attempt to shock with sexuality", adding, [...] "the album shimmers with sensuality, openness and thirst for new adventures, musically and otherwise." [...] Len Righi of The Morning Call called it [...] "compelling, as she tackled almost every imaginable social ill and personal problem while still leaving room for freakiness and fun." [...] Jane Dark of City Pages stated it [...] "eludes genre-fication", leaving Jackson [...] "in a genre of her own". Alluded to [...] "an eroticon of <b>cybersex,</b> queer positivity, and mild bondage", Dark regarded its production [...] "a sexy motherfucker... abstractly electro tones come and go with sharp attack and sharper decay, appearing out of--and vanishing into--aggressively blank spaces". Jackson's [...] "flawed sweetness" [...] was also acclaimed; concluding, [...] "She's the principle that organizes the noise, and the particle around which songs become pearlescent". USA Today praised her usage of [...] "edgier beats and rawer emotions." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Season 4 finale, Leonard {{runs into}} Penny and Raj {{as they come}} out of his room in the morning, just after Leonard and Priya appear to break up upon Leonard's {{learning}} that Priya is soon moving back to India. At the start of Season 5, Leonard and Priya are trying to maintain a long-distance relationship via Skype (including a failed attempt at <b>cybersex)</b> with Priya continuing to treat Leonard like a submissive partner. Despite being the most eager to have sex, Leonard proves he is quite awkward in these situations. Leonard later goes to a wedding with Amy, and they seem to take a liking to each other, though Sheldon disapproves, karate-chopping Leonard and saying, [...] "She's not for you...not for you!". Later, despite feeling that he and Priya were in love and might get married, Leonard finds himself attracted to a comic book artist named Alice. The attraction is mutual, and they even share a kiss. Right when they are about to have sex, however, he tells Alice that he has a girlfriend, thus ending the relationship. Leonard then decides to confess his behavior to Priya via Skype, but he is shocked to learn that Priya has also betrayed him, sleeping with her former boyfriend; Priya defends that they both slipped up a little, but Leonard corrects her saying that he slipped a little, while she slipped a lot, bringing the conversation to a strained end. In the next episode, Leonard tells Sheldon that he is single, implying that he and Priya have broken up; his actions since then have confirmed their split occurred.|$|E
