25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less <b>chance</b> <b>you</b> will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E

On 3 January 2008, The Sydney Morning Herald's critic Michael Idato declared the series [...] "The Blue Murder of its time", referring to the critically acclaimed 1995 ABC TV drama Blue Murder, {{considered by many to}} be the finest crime drama ever produced in Australia. In a review on his blog on 17 January 2008, David Knox, stated that Underbelly [...] "is our own Sopranos", and awarded it 4.5 out of 5. He also commented [...] "If there are any criticisms to be found with Underbelly, they are few. One or two shots give away that period Melbourne was actually shot in 2007. And while watching these gangsters thrive on power with ballsy disdain, it was hard not to think of the behaviour of some television executives in recent history. This aside, Underbelly looks set to be one of the highlights of the 2008 television year." [...] A review appeared in the Herald Sun on 18 January 2008, in which critic Paul Anderson quoted: [...] "Whether you followed the Melbourne gangland war or not, there's a fair <b>chance</b> <b>you</b> will be blown away by the coming TV series Underbelly. [...] is a slick, violent and sexually charged dramatisation backed by a ripping soundtrack." [...] In an article appearing on 31 January 2008, The Daily Telegraph's TV editor, Marcus Casey, said of Underbelly after viewing the first four episodes: [...] "If the quality is maintained then, while not perfect, Underbelly should equal, if not better, Australia's best ever crime dramas – the Phoenix series and Blue Murder." ...|$|E

500|$|Mic {{organized}} {{a list of}} [...] "5 Reasons Claire Huxatable (sic) is the Ultimate Feminist Mom", and The Huffington Post crowned The Cosby Show [...] "One of the Most Feminist Shows of All Time" [...] due to individual contributions from both Clair and Cliff. Dubbed the [...] "feminist rant" [...] by media publications, Clair's speech to future son-in-law Elvin about gender roles in marriage in the episode [...] "Cliff in Love" [...] is often lauded {{as one of the}} character's greatest moments, to which the studio audience responded with enthusiastic applause. CNN ranked the rant their seventh favorite The Cosby Show moment. Slates Jason Bailey hailed the scene as [...] "Rashad’s finest moment on the show." [...] The rant has proven so popular that it continues to be frequently quoted and referenced on the Internet and social media. Pastes Shannon M. Houston believes that [...] "If you’re a woman, and you work, and you identify as a feminist, there’s a 90 percent <b>chance</b> <b>you</b> or someone you know has posted that clip". Additionally, Houston believes that the scene remains so popular because the discussion about women in the workplace has hardly changed since the episode first aired 30 years ago. According to Nico Lang of The Daily Dot, Clair taught an entire generation [...] "what a strong, successful woman looked like". Former United States First Lady Michelle Obama has constantly been compared to Clair, by which Obama admitted she is flattered because she considers the character to be an [...] "American icon". Patrice Evans of Jezebel wrote that although [...] "Michelle Obama might be taking the baton as the quintessential symbol of the professional black woman/doting mother ... she'll still need Barack to win a second term before she can approach the status of Clair Huxtable." [...] However, Rashad herself has discredited the Clair-Obama comparisons. LGBT rights activist Janet Mock cites Clair as one of her biggest influences: [...] "I wanted to be her; I wanted to be beautiful, be successful, and maybe have a great family and a brownstone in Brooklyn." ...|$|E

His last studio recordings as a leader were made in November 1971 for the English Black Lion label, near the end of a worldwide tour with the Giants of Jazz, a group which included Gillespie, Kai Winding, Sonny Stitt, Al McKibbon, and Blakey. Bassist McKibbon, who had known Monk for over twenty years and played on his final tour in 1971, later said: [...] "On that tour, Monk said about two words. I mean literally maybe two words. He didn't say 'Good morning,' 'Goodnight,' 'What time?' Nothing. Why, I don't know. He sent word back after the tour was over that the reason he couldn't communicate or play was that Art Blakey and I were so ugly." [...] A different side of Monk is revealed in Lewis Porter's biography, John Coltrane: His Life and Music; Coltrane states: [...] "Monk is exactly the opposite of Miles : he talks about music all the time, and he wants so much for you to understand that if, by <b>chance,</b> <b>you</b> ask him something, he'll spend hours if necessary to explain it to you."

The musical sequences are highly entertaining, uplifting and contagious". He also added that it’s everything a movie-goer would want in a movie and the timeless crowd-pleaser is most certainly highly recommended. He also added that Concepcion is simply sensational while Coleta could be in a Best Supporting Actor award. Cristina Martinez-Belen of Manila Bulletin also gave the film a positive review. She stated, [...] "...i’ve never enjoyed a Filipino movie as much as I enjoyed this(I Do Bidoo Bidoo) which is being dubbed the grand movie-oke of the year...very Filipino in soul and essence.

[...] Another raved that the music of the APO Hiking Society that’s featured in the film “rocks.” Still another went as {{far as to say that}} it’s the “Best Picture Of The Year.” Ria Limjap of SPOT.ph also gave the film a favorable review stating, [...] "The pamamanhikan scene is brilliant: old fashioned metaphoric speech, initiating an awesome salawikain battle that segues into one of the most charming numbers in the movie (“Salawikain”)." [...] The same goes with the review from Philippine Entertainment Portal (PEP), stating that the movie is a total charmer and its production design is just as excellent, while every backdrop looks meticulously planned. It further added, [...] "Well-choreographed musical numbers help the film feel fresh, and the decision to use songs from the APO Hiking Society hike the nostalgia." [...] He also praises that all casts are perfect for the role. A review from GMA News gave the film a 4/5 rating. The writer, Job B. De Leon states that, [...] "...beyond the music and the actors, it draws strength from its script as it probes the different angles of a teenage pregnancy–how a young couple tries to deal with uncertainty and responsibility, and how parents recover when their darlings color outside the lines of their pre-drawn aspirationsfor all the film's dramatic build-up, there is no climactic moralizing or grand confrontation. Instead the denouement is set to song and highlights to audiences, young and old alike, that together with values like love, friendship and family, the music of APO is forever". The Cinema Evaluation Board, who gave the film the highest rating, [...] "A" [...] states that the film has exceptional performances. Mell Navarro of Independent Cinema Artists of the Philippines commented, [...] "A must-see film! Wonderful! Brilliant!". According to Bong Austero of Manila Standard Today, [...] "...It (I Do Bidoo Bidoo) is in many ways even better than foreign musicals. For one, it features music that has relevance and meaning in our lives. Second, it’s a movie that makes you feel good about being Filipino." [...] He further stated, [...] "...we are told that it is not exactly making the kind of money that Praybeyt Benjamin or No Other Woman made, which is really sad because I Do Bidoo Bidoo is infinitely better than those two other films, which were major blockbusters...if you don’t patronize movies like I Do Bidoo Bidoo, then you should stop complaining about the sorry state of Philippine cinema."Ateneo de Manila University's official publication, The Guidon gave the film 4 stars of 5 and included it at #6 on their [...] "2012 Top Films".|$|E
