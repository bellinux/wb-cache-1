5|$|There {{are good}} {{examples}} of horizontal water mills, also known as Norse or <b>Clack</b> Mills, around Dutch Loch. Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs, built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill-stone was sited. Inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone, and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the paddles below. Some were still in use on Papa Stour {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of Clumlie, at Troswick in the south Mainland of Shetland.|$|E

Andy arrives and rebuilds the romantic tent in the yard for a flattered April. Leslie tells Ron about her mental block, worrying she will never again reproduce an idea better than harvest festival.

25|$|Construction {{on several}} {{arterial}} and connective streets {{is indicative of}} the area's strong commercial growth. Southwest Drive was widened from 2 lanes each direction (plus central left-turn lane) to 3 lanes each direction, totaling 7 lanes from Catclaw Drive to S. <b>Clack</b> Street and 6 lanes under the Winters Freeway. This project was completed in late 2008. Also, Catclaw Drive was reconstructed and reconfigured to create 2 northbound lanes, 1 southbound lane, and 1 shared left-turn lane. The frontage roads of the Winters Freeway, S. <b>Clack</b> Street and S. Danville Drive, were reconstructed from S. 14th St to the US 83/84 & Loop 322 interchange, with restriping and minor widening done between Southwest Drive and Buffalo Gap Road from 2 lanes each to 3 lanes each.|$|E

50|$|In Going Postal, Lord Vetinari, the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork {{arranged}} to have Lipwig survive his hanging. When Lipwig woke up, Vetinari offered him a job as Ankh-Morpork's Postmaster General which Lipwig could take or reject of his own free will (the alternative being, essentially, death, again of his own free will). At that time, the city's postal service had long since ceased operation, the remaining 2 employees doing useless things punctiliously every day. The task of restoring it had {{claimed the lives of}} four of Vetinari's clerks, and the competing and mercilessly corporate <b>Clacks</b> network, the Grand Trunk <b>Clacks</b> Company, was being run by a conman, Reacher Gilt. Lipwig nonetheless manages to revive the postal service by applying the principles of the con to honest work, introduces the postage stamp and causes the downfall of the Grand Trunk <b>Clacks</b> Company by exposing the fraudulent practices introduced by Gilt. By the beginning of Making Money, the <b>Clacks</b> network is run by the Ankh-Morpork Postal Service.|$|R

The mill was working by wind until the 1920s, when the mill became unable to turn to wind because of a broken curb. The mill was stripped of machinery and the cap and sails removed by Neve's in 1933.|$|E
