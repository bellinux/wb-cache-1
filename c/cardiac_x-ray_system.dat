40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether a reduction in radiation dose was found whilst maintaining a clinically acceptable level of image quality for trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) patients using a new cardiac interventional X-ray system with state-of-the-art image enhancement and X-ray optimisation, compared to the <b>cardiac</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>system</b> which was previously used for TAVI (the reference system). METHODS: Patient dose and image data were retrospectively collected from an AlluraClarity (Philips Healthcare) and Axion Artis (Siemens Healthcare), the new and reference X-ray systems respectively. Patient procedure dose area product (DAP) and fluoroscopy duration of 41 patient cases from each X-ray system were compared using a Wilcoxon test on median values. Significant reductions in patient dose (p<< 0. 001) were found for the new system with no significant change in fluoroscopy duration (p= 0. 052); procedure DAP reduced by 55 %, fluoroscopy DAP by 48 % and “cine” acquisition DAP by 61 %. Ten patient aortograms from each X-ray system (20 total) were scored by 32 observers on a continuous scale to assess the clinical image quality at the given phase of the TAVI procedure. Scores were dichotomised by acceptability and analysed using a Chi-squared test; {{there was no significant difference}} between the two X-ray systems (p= 0. 06). CONCLUSIONS: The new <b>cardiac</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>system</b> demonstrated a very significant reduction in patient dose with no loss of clinical image quality. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The huge growth of TAVI may impact on the radiation exposure incurred by cardiac patients and particularly on operators including not only interventional cardiologists, also anaesthetists for TAVI procedures; the cumulative exposure to interventional cardiologists performing high volume TAVI over a 30 - 40 year career may be harmful. The Phillips Clarity upgrade including improved digital image enhancement and optimised X-ray settings significantly reduced the amount of radiation used without reducing clinically acceptable image quality...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether a reduction in radiation dose was found for percutaneous coronary interventional (PCI) patients using a new <b>cardiac</b> interventional <b>X-ray</b> <b>system</b> with state-of-the-art image enhancement and X-ray optimisation, compared to the current generation <b>X-ray</b> <b>system,</b> and to determine the corresponding impact on clinical image quality. Patient procedure dose area product (DAP) and fluoroscopy duration of 131 PCI patient cases from each <b>X-ray</b> <b>system</b> were compared using a Wilcoxon test on median values. Significant reductions in patient dose (p<< 0. 001) were found for the new system with no significant change in fluoroscopy duration (p= 0. 2); procedure DAP reduced by 64 %, fluoroscopy DAP by 51 % and “cine” acquisition DAP by 76 %. The image quality of 15 patient angiograms from each <b>X-ray</b> <b>system</b> (30 total) was scored by 75 clinical professionals on a continuous scale for the ability to determine the presence and severity of stenotic lesions; image quality scores were analysed using a two-sample t-test. Image quality was reduced by 9 % (p<< 0. 001) for the new <b>X-ray</b> <b>system.</b> This demonstrates a substantial reduction in patient dose, from acquisition more than fluoroscopy imaging, with slightly reduced image quality, for the new <b>X-ray</b> <b>system</b> compared to the current generation system...|$|R
40|$|Modern <b>cardiac</b> <b>x-ray</b> imaging <b>systems</b> {{regulate}} their {{radiation output}} {{based on the}} thickness of the patient to maintain an acceptable signal at the input of the x-ray detector. This approach does not account for the context of the examination or the content of the image displayed. We have developed a machine vision algorithm that detects iodine-filled blood vessels and fits an idealized vessel model with the key parameters of contrast, diameter, and linear attenuation coefficient. The spatio-temporal distribution of the linear attenuation coefficient samples, when appropriately arranged, can be described by a simple linear relationship, despite the complexity of scene information. The algorithm was tested on static anthropomorphic chest phantom images under different radiographic factors and 60 dynamic clinical image sequences. It was found to be robust and sensitive to changes in vessel contrast resulting from variations in system parameters. The machine vision algorithm has the potential of extracting real-time context sensitive information that may be used for augmenting existing dose control strategies...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades there have been {{significant}} advances in the technology used in the field of <b>cardiac</b> <b>X-ray</b> imaging with the advent of fully digital X-ray detectors. However, the means by which the advantages of this technology are implemented at a systems level remain basic. Most modern <b>cardiac</b> <b>X-ray</b> imaging <b>systems</b> employ feedback control to maintain an adequate average output signal level to the X-ray detector based on the attenuation properties of the patient. This approach is not necessarily optimal over the range of clinical imaging tasks for an individual, or over an anthropomorphically heterogeneous population. Within this thesis methods are presented for extracting dynamic real-time information from within cardiac image sequences that are suitable for incorporation in automatic dose rate control systems that regulate their output based on clinically relevant image quality metrics. A framework is proposed that combines image quality metrics for contrast and noise on a per image frame basis to provide an overall indicator of image acceptability. These metrics are compared to the performance of experienced clinical observers. The methods presented have a wider applicability to other X-ray procedures that use dynamic imaging of blood vessels made visible by the use of contrast agents...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} closed-loop dose {{control system}} balances the radiation dose delivered {{to patients and}} the quality of images produced in <b>cardiac</b> <b>x-ray</b> imaging <b>systems.</b> Using computer simulations, this study compared two designs of automatic x-ray dose control in terms of the radiation dose and quality of images produced. The first design, commonly in <b>x-ray</b> <b>systems</b> today, maintained a constant dose rate at the image receptor. The second design maintained a constant image quality in the output images. A computer model represented patients as a polymethylmetacrylate phantom (which has similar x-ray attenuation to soft tissue), containing a detail representative of an artery filled with contrast medium. The model predicted the entrance surface dose to the phantom and contrast to noise ratio of the detail as an index of image quality. Results showed that for the constant dose control system, phantom dose increased substantially with phantom size (x 5 increase between 20 cm and 30 cm thick phantom), yet the image quality decreased by 43 % for the same thicknesses. For the constant quality control, phantom dose increased at a greater rate with phantom thickness (>x 10 increase between 20 cm and 30 cm phantom). Image quality based dose control could tailor the x-ray output to just achieve the quality required, which would reduce dose to patients where the current dose control produces images of too high quality. However, maintaining higher levels of image quality for large patients would result in a significant dose increase over current practice...|$|R
40|$|Background Interventional <b>X-ray</b> <b>systems</b> {{used for}} <b>cardiac</b> {{catheterisation}} procedures are operated by pre-programmed automatic dose rate control. Radiographic factors are automatically {{selected based on}} imaging geometry and estimated patient thickness - which depends on image projection as well as patient size. Purpose The aim {{of this research was}} to determine optimal X-ray beam energy for cardiac image acquisition in a system-independent manner, for a range of paediatric and adult patient sizes. Methods Patients and iodine based contrast medium were simulated using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and tin respectively. X-ray tube voltage (kVp) and Cu X-ray beam filtration were independently varied and images were captured on a flat panel detector based <b>cardiac</b> <b>X-ray</b> imaging <b>system.</b> Tin detail contrast was calculated and flat field image noise was measured to determine the contrast to noise ratio (CNR). Entrance surface and effective dose measurements were obtained to calculate CNR 2 / dose, which determined dose efficiency. Results Lower kVp was favoured, more so for thinner PMMA; as Cu increased, lower kVp was favoured. For the smallest phantom (8. 5 cm), CNR 2 / dose was highest at 50 kVp with 0. 4 mm Cu considering both dose measurements. For the largest phantom (30 cm), using 80 kVp with 0. 25 mm Cu and 85 kVp with no filtration provided the highest CNR 2 / dose for entrance surface and effective dose respectively. Conclusions Optimal beam energy can be used, with X-ray dose adjusted for clinically acceptable image quality and X-ray tube loading limits, for a given task and patient size...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{spectral}} filtration in digital ('cine') acquisition was investigated using a flat panel <b>cardiac</b> interventional <b>X-ray</b> imaging <b>system.</b> A 0. 1 -mm copper (Cu) and 1. 0 -mm aluminium (Al) filter {{added to the}} standard acquisition mode created the filtered mode for comparison. Image sequences of 35 patients were acquired, a double-blind subjective image quality assessment was completed and dose-area product (DAP) rates were calculated. Entrance surface dose (ESD) and effective dose (E) rates were determined for 20 - and 30 -cm phantoms. Phantom ESD fell by 28 and 41 % and E by 1 and 0. 7 %, for the 20 - and 30 -cm phantoms, respectively, when using the filtration. Patient DAP rates fell by 43 % with {{no statistically significant difference}} in clinical image quality. Adding 0. 1 -mm Cu and 1. 0 -mm Al filtration in acquisition substantially reduces patient ESD and DAP, with no significant change in E or clinical image quality...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to quantify the reduction in radiation dose facilitated by image processing alone for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patient angiograms, without reducing the perceived image quality required to confidently make a diagnosis. Methods: Incremental amounts of image noise were added to five PCI angiograms, simulating the angiogram as having been acquired at corresponding lower dose levels (10 - 89 % dose reduction). Sixteen observers with relevant experience scored the image quality of these angiograms in three states - with no image processing and with two different modern image processing algorithms applied. These algorithms are used on state-of-the-art and previous generation <b>cardiac</b> interventional <b>X-ray</b> <b>systems.</b> Ordinal regression allowing for random effects and the delta method were used to quantify the dose reduction possible by the processing algorithms, for equivalent image quality scores. Results: Observers rated the quality of the images processed with the state-of-the-art and previous generation image processing with a 24. 9 % and 15. 6 % dose reduction respectively as equivalent in quality to the unenhanced images. The dose reduction facilitated by the state-of-the-art image processing relative to previous generation processing was 10. 3 %. Conclusions: Results demonstrate that statistically significant dose reduction can be facilitated with no loss in perceived image quality using modern image enhancement; the most recent processing algorithm was more effective in preserving image quality at lower doses. Advances in knowledge: Image enhancement was shown to maintain perceived image quality in coronary angiography at a reduced level of radiation dose using computer software to produce synthetic images from real angiograms simulating a reduction in dose...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} method to {{automatically}} parameterize noise in <b>cardiac</b> <b>x-ray</b> image sequences. The aim was to provide context-sensitive imaging information for use in regulating dose control feedback systems that relates {{to the experience of}} human observers. The algorithm locates and measures noise contained in areas of approximately equal signal level. A single noise metric is derived from the dominant noise components based on their magnitude and spatial location in relation to clinically relevant structures. The output of the algorithm was compared to noise and clinical acceptability ratings from 28 observers viewing 40 different <b>cardiac</b> <b>x-ray</b> imaging sequences.

40|$|Dynamic <b>X-ray</b> imaging <b>systems</b> {{are used}} for interventional cardiac {{procedures}} to treat coronary heart disease. X-ray settings are controlled automatically by specially-designed X-ray dose control mechanisms whose role is to ensure an adequate level of image quality is maintained with an acceptable radiation dose to the patient. Current commonplace dose control designs quantify image quality by performing a simple technical measurement directly from the image. However, the utility of <b>cardiac</b> <b>X-ray</b> images is in their interpretation by a cardiologist during an interventional procedure, {{rather than in a}} technical measurement. With the long term goal of devising a clinically-relevant image quality metric for an intelligent dose control system, we aim to investigate the relationship of image noise with clinical professionals’ perception of dynamic image sequences. Computer-generated noise was added, in incremental amounts, to angiograms of five different patients selected to represent the range of adult cardiac patient sizes. A two alternative forced choice staircase experiment was used to determine the amount of noise which can be added to a patient image sequences without changing image quality as perceived by clinical professionals. Twenty-five viewing sessions (five for each patient) were completed by thirteen observers. Results demonstrated scope to increase the noise of <b>cardiac</b> <b>X-ray</b> images by up to 21 % ± 8 % before it is noticeable by clinical professionals. This indicates a potential for 21 % radiation dose reduction since X-ray image noise and radiation dose are directly related; this would be beneficial to both patients and personnel...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{illustrate}} the feasibility to use noise as a measure for data loss in compression of <b>cardiac</b> <b>X-ray</b> images. In lossy medical image compression, the requirements {{for the preservation of}} diagnostic integrity cannot be easily formulated in terms of a perceptual model. Especially since, in reality, human visual perception is dependent on numerous factors such as the viewing conditions and psycho-visual factors. In general, due to the low exposure, <b>cardiac</b> <b>X-ray</b> images tend to be relatively noisy. In the assumption that noise, in case it is not correlated with the signal, contains no diagnostic information, we propose a compression scheme, based on (overlapping) block transforms, exploiting the different spectral distributions of signal and noise. 1 INTRODUCTION 1. 1 Perception- versus noise-based quantization An important issue in lossy compression of medical images is the risk of destroying diagnostically relevant information.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to {{evaluate}} interventional radiology <b>x-ray</b> <b>system</b> performance in order to analyze its influence on patient dose. Entrance air kerma rate in fluoroscopy modes and aire kerma per image in cine modes were measured at the entrance of PMMA slabs (10 to 30 cm) in two interventional <b>x-ray</b> <b>systems.</b> Air kerma evaluation was performed in all image intensifiers (II) diameters and in all fluoroscopy and cine modes used in the clinical practice with an ionization chamber. High and low contrast resolution was evaluated for all PMMA thickness, II and modes, with two quality image tests (NEMA XR 21 and Leeds TOR- 18 FG). Significant differences were found in air kerma rate and air kerma per image in both <b>x-ray</b> <b>systems</b> for comparable II and modes. For example, for 24 cm PMMA thickness in fluoroscopic high dose mode, in one <b>x-ray</b> <b>system</b> delivers 0. 49 mGy/s and the other one 1. 87 mGy/s. However, differences in image quality were not significant. In the same conditions described above, Leeds test showed: 0. 032 (low contrast) and 1. 25 lpmm (spatial frequency). In addition, when phantom thickness increase, image quality decreases in <b>x-ray</b> <b>systems,</b> but in one of them, the difference is high.

40|$|Objectives To commemorate {{victims of}} {{electrical}} accidents {{that occurred in}} the first decades of radiology and relate these accidents to the evolution of the X-ray apparatus. Methods Digitised newspapers, scientific journals, books and reports of legal procedures were searched for electrical accidents involving <b>X-ray</b> <b>systems.</b> Information on the his-torical systems was retrieved from the scientific literature and brochures from manufacturers. Results We found 51 fatal and 62 non-fatal but serious elec-trical accidents. Most of them occurred between 1920 and 1940 and involved transformers that provided output currents well above the threshold for the induction of ventricular fibrillation. The accidents led to recommendations and regu-lations to improve safety for operators and patients, and spurred manufacturers to technical developments that culmi-nated in fully electrically shockproof systems by 1935. Conclusions Although largely forgotten, the development of the shockproof <b>X-ray</b> <b>systems</b> we take for granted today lasted about 4 decades and was associated with considerable human suffering. The complete solution of the problem is a success story of engineering realised by contributions from all parties involved.
