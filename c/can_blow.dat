5|$|Category1 storms usually cause no {{significant}} structural damage to most well-constructed permanent structures; however, they can topple unanchored mobile homes, {{as well as}} uproot or snap weak trees. Poorly attached roof shingles or tiles <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> off. Coastal flooding and pier damage are often associated with Category1 storms. Power outages are typically widespread to extensive, sometimes lasting several days. Even though it is the least intense type of hurricane, the storm can still produce widespread damage and can be a life-threatening storm.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{irritation}} can {{be avoided}} by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds {{than the rest of}} the bulb. Refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> the gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.|$|E
5|$|For {{their next}} mission, {{the party is}} sent to the city of Bafsk to prevent the {{construction}} of a large airship known as the Dreadnought; however, it takes off just as they arrive. After retrieving the Sunfire, a weapon which <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> up the Dreadnought, they watch helplessly as an airship with Hilda on board is captured by the Dreadnought. When the Dreadnought lands to stock up on supplies, the party rescues Hilda and throws the Sunfire into the airship's engine. Before escaping from the explosion, the party encounters a dark knight whom Maria thinks she recognizes as Leon.|$|E

5|$|Bond {{follows the}} {{diamonds}} to a pick-up by Bert Saxby, Whyte's head of security, and then onto a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where {{he finds that}} a satellite is being built by a laser refraction specialist, Professor Dr. Metz. Suspecting Whyte, Bond tries to confront him, but instead meets Blofeld, who captures the agent and explains {{to him that the}} satellite <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> up nuclear missiles. Blofeld admits that he intends to auction it to the highest bidder. Bond escapes and frees the captive Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using an offshore oil rig as his base. Bond attacks the rig, stopping Blofeld's operation and dispersing his organisation.|$|E
5|$|A {{recovered}} propeller {{showed that}} the engine had been running at near-cruising speed {{at the time of}} the impact. Additionally, the condition of the wheels proved that the undercarriage was still retracted, suggesting controlled flight into terrain rather than an attempted emergency landing. During the final portion of Star Dust flight, heavy clouds would have blocked visibility of the ground. It has therefore been suggested that, in the absence of visual sightings of the ground due to the clouds, a large navigational error could have been made as the aircraft flew through the jet stream—a phenomenon not well understood in 1947, in which high-altitude winds <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> at high speed in directions different from those of winds observed at ground level. If the airliner, which had to cross the Andes mountain range at , had entered the jet-stream zone—which in this area normally blows from the west and south-west, resulting in the aircraft encountering a headwind—this would have significantly decreased the aircraft's ground speed.|$|E
5|$|Everyone sits in silence, {{waiting for}} Parsons's manager to arrive. Jan {{suggests}} that Graham blow up another balloon for Tamsin. Sally, Si and Graham realise that, {{with the camera}} footage they have, they <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> up all the purple balloons and sell them to multiple bidders. Jan screams when she sees movement in Tamsin's bedroom, and it is realised that Frankie is still alive. Jan takes Tamsin {{out of the room}} and the remaining three agree, after panicked discussion, that they should kill Frankie. Si loses a coin toss and smothers Frankie with a cushion. Later, out on the street, Frankie's body is put into an ambulance. Si says to Sally and Graham that he will be in touch and leaves. Sally and Graham discuss selling the camcorder footage, and Jan runs inside to see that Tamsin is not in her chair or room. Upstairs, Tamsin crawls onto the bed containing the balloon, carrying a heart-shaped helium balloon. On the street, Sally, Graham and Jan see Tamsin opening the upstairs window. She releases the helium balloon with the balloon containing Frankie's breath attached. The two float skyward as Graham films.|$|E

5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E
25|$|Weather {{patterns}} play {{a crucial}} role in determining the migration route. Birds like to travel so that the temperature, pressure and humidity work with the tailwinds. Strong winds <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> birds off of their regular migration route. For example, the effects of a large storm lead to a higher presence of the white-rumped sandpiper on the King George Islands.|$|E
25|$|Other {{evidence}} {{supported this}} theory. During {{the investigation of}} Mrs. Muncey's murder, the doctor who performed the autopsy passed the vials to two local law enforcement officers who transported it to the FBI, where further testing occurred. The blood was contained in four vials, evidently with neither preservative nor a proper seal. The vials, in turn, were stored in a foam box, but nothing indicates the box was kept cool. Rather, in violation of proper procedure, the foam box was packed in the same cardboard box as other evidence, including House's pants and other clothing. The cardboard box was carried in the officers' car, and transported while they made the 10-hour journey from Tennessee to the FBI lab. Blood vials in hot conditions (such as a car trunk in the summer) <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> open. By the time the blood reached the FBI it had hemolyzed, or spoiled, due to heat exposure. By the time the blood passed from the FBI to a defense expert, roughly a vial and a half were empty, though the agent who had analyzed it testified he used at most a quarter of one vial. Blood, moreover, {{was found to have}} seeped onto one corner of the foam box and onto packing gauze inside the box below the vials.|$|E

25|$|A Santa Ana fog is a {{derivative}} phenomenon {{in which a}} ground fog settles in coastal Southern California {{at the end of}} a Santa Ana wind episode. When Santa Ana conditions prevail, with winds in the lower two to three kilometers (1.25-1.8 miles) of the atmosphere from the north through east, the air over the coastal basin is extremely dry, and this dry air extends out over offshore waters of the Pacific Ocean. When the Santa Ana winds cease, the cool and moist marine layer may re-form rapidly over the ocean if conditions are right. The air in the marine layer becomes very moist and very low clouds or fog occurs. If wind gradients turn on-shore with enough strength, this sea fog is blown onto the coastal areas. This marks a sudden and surprising transition from the hot, dry Santa Ana conditions to cool, moist, and gray marine weather, as the Santa Ana fog <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> onshore and envelope cities in as quickly as fifteen minutes. However, a true Santa Ana fog is rare, because it requires conditions conducive to rapid re-forming of the marine layer, plus a rapid and strong reversal in wind gradients from off-shore to on-shore winds. More often, the high pressure system over the Great Basin, which caused the Santa Ana conditions in the first place, is slow to weaken or move east across the United States. In this more usual case, the Santa Ana winds cease, but warm, dry conditions under a stationary air mass continue for days or even weeks after the Santa Ana wind event ends.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, Lieutenant Colonel Richard J. Dunn was {{appointed}} as bandmaster. As {{a former member}} of John Philip Sousa's Marine Band and with 26 years of military band leadership experience, Dunn quickly instituted changes within the band. The first was to the position of bugler, whose duties had fallen to the bandmaster since 1894. When informed that he was expected to fill the role, Dunn told college officials, [...] "I have blown enough bugles. I am the Bandmaster. Someone else <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> the bugle calls." [...] From then on, the Corps Bugler was chosen from the ranks of the Aggie Band.|$|E

Government weather services first assign names to systems that reach this intensity (thus the term named storm). Although {{tropical storm}}s are less intense than a hurricane they can produce significant damage. The shear force of winds <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> off shingles, and air borne objects can cause damage to power lines, roofing and siding. More dangerous is the heavy rainfall causing inland flooding.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics {{underwent}} {{some minor}} changes after Harrison presented the song to the Beatles in January 1969, {{when they began}} working at London's Twickenham Film Studios for the so-called Get Back project (released as the Let It Be album and film). He had initially written the second line of verse two as the more literal [...] "A wind <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> those clouds away", but bootlegs from the sessions reveal John Lennon suggesting the word [...] "mind" [...] to introduce a bit of [...] "psychedelia" [...] into the song.

500|$|The tone of {{the songs}} shifts after the first verse, growing more defiant, and the second verse of the song criticizes the {{violence}} under apartheid, with Gabriel singing about trying to sleep but being able to [...] "only dream in red" [...] because of his anger at the death of black people. The lyrics of the third verse seek to motivate the listener: [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> out a candle/But you can't blow out a fire/Once the flames begin to catch/The wind will blow it higher", suggesting that though Biko is dead, the movement against apartheid would continue. The lyrics express a sense of outrage, {{not only at the}} suffering of people under apartheid, but at the fact that that suffering was often forgotten or denied.|$|E

500|$|The {{substance}} that the suspect tried to detonate {{was more than}} [...] of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), a crystalline powder that is often the active ingredient of plastic explosives, the high explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP), and other ingredients. PETN {{is among the most}} powerful of explosives, and chemically resembles nitroglycerin. The powder was analyzed by the FBI at Quantico, and an FBI affidavit filed in the Eastern District of Michigan reflected preliminary findings that the device contained PETN. The authorities also found the remains of the syringe. The suspect apparently carried the PETN onto the plane in a -long soft plastic container, possibly a condom, attached to his underwear.

He had joined as a saxophonist, though he records learning the oboe: [...] "I long for the time when I <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> my oboe well enough {{to play in the}} band". [...] In his 18 months' service, Grainger [...] made frequent appearances as a pianist at Red Cross and Liberty bond concerts. As a regular encore [...] he began to play a piano setting of the tune [...] "Country Gardens". The piece became instantly popular; [...] sheet music sales quickly broke many publishing records.

500|$|On 4 June 2013, Azalea {{confirmed}} that British recording artist Rita Ora would feature on her debut studio The New Classic, after previously announcing Ora's feature on 26 December 2012.

Azalea then asked Perry if she could record [...] "Black Widow" [...] for her album, which Perry then agreed to. The record, however, was never sent to Azalea and on 1 August 2013, she denied that Ora would be collaborating with her on the album. Azalea then met Perry for the first time, as her supporting act at the iTunes Festival that year. At the festival, Perry approached Azalea with an offer to record [...] "Black Widow" [...] as she felt the song would suit her better. Azalea was then invited to Perry's after party that night, where the two exchanged numbers, and Perry sent Azalea the record. When Azalea received the song, it only consisted of a hook and a beat. She initially wanted Perry to sing the song's hook, but Perry was unable to because of time constraints. In an interview, Azalea mentioned, [...] "It needed someone who could really sing, as Katy's voice is awesome. The sky's the limit for Rita. Rita's a superstar and she will only get bigger. Rita is a great fit. Her voice <b>can</b> <b>blow</b> people away." [...] Azalea and Ora then begun recording [...] "Black Widow" [...] in November 2013 after the MTV Europe Music Awards, and completed it in January 2014.|$|E
