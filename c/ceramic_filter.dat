50|$|A further {{advantage}} of vacuum <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> {{is the high}} output capacity with a very low water content and drier filter cake. By comparison, {{the performance of a}} VDFK-3 <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> was compared with the existing BOU-40 and BLN40-3 drum type vacuum filters to filter aluminium hydroxide. From the results, the average moisture content was 5% lower when a vacuum <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> was used.|$|E
50|$|A vacuum <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> is {{designed}} to separate liquids from solids for dewatering purposes. The device consists of a rotator, slurry tank, <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> plate, distributor, discharge scraper, cleaning device, frame, agitating device, pipe system, vacuum system, automatic acid dosing system, automatic lubricating system, valve and discharge chute. The operation and construction principle of vacuum <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> resemble those of a conventional disc filter, but the filter medium {{is replaced by a}} finely porous ceramic disc. The disc material is inert, has a long operational life and is resistant to almost all chemicals. Performance can be optimized by taking into account all those factors which affect the overall efficiency of the separation process. Some of the variables affecting the performance of a vacuum <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> include the solid concentration, speed rotation of the disc, slurry level in the feed basin, temperature of the feed slurry, and the pressure during dewatering stages and filter cake formation.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} common types of ceramic water filter are pot type and candle type filters. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> systems {{consist of a}} porous <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> that is {{attached}} to, or sits {{on top of a}} plastic or ceramic receptacle. Contaminated water is poured into a top container. It passes through the filter(s) into the receptacle below. The lower receptacle usually is fitted with a tap.|$|E
50|$|Ceramic {{resonators}} look {{similar to}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters.</b> <b>Ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> are frequently {{used in the}} IF stages of superheterodyne receivers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> {{have been}} used for water {{treatment}} for several centuries. While they are being marketed for centralized water treatment systems, most <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> are now being manufactured for point of use applications.|$|R
30|$|<b>Ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> are {{resistant}} against solvent and high temperatures [5]. These filters have good aerosol particle removal efficiency. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> {{have a large}} use in industries particularly in the corrosive, high-temperature and high-pressure environment. These filters are recoverable. It is also possible to improve the filtration quality of these filters by ameliorating the holes and consequently the porosity of <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> results in decreasing the pressure drop and increasing the separation efficiency [6, 7, 8]. These filters offer a unique method {{in the treatment of}} effluents in industries. The <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> can also be used for gaseous separation, especially for isotope separations of an element in the nuclear industries [9, 10].|$|R

50|$|This step {{may not be}} {{necessary}} depending on {{the source of the}} cells. Animal tissue however is likely to yield connective tissue which must be removed. Commonly, filtration is achieved either by pouring through gauze or with a suction filter and the relevant grade <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Vacuum {{ceramic filters}} {{also have a}} longer service life while cloth filters have to be replaced, which {{eventually}} increases the moisture content of the cake, lowers the productivity and disturbs the production operations. [...] In addition, the <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> is both mechanically and chemically reliable enough to withstand regeneration.|$|E
30|$|<b>Ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> {{with lower}} {{percentage}} composition of burn out code 1, 2, 3 and code 4, 5, 6 were confirmed no significant variation however <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> code 7, 8, 9 were showed significant variation compared to others filter codes 1, 2, 3 and code 4, 5, 6. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> with similar composition of clay to saw dust ratio and fired at temperature of 750  °C and 800  °C have {{more or less}} the same removal efficiency of microbials.|$|R
30|$|The {{result of}} {{this study showed that}} most of the {{developed}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> for this work were found to be effective in removing microorganisms from contaminated water as compared with WHO guidelines (WHO 2012). Figure  3, also shows that the E. coli removal efficiency of all the <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> was relatively higher than the total coli form removal efficiency of the filter elements. The statistical ANOVA analysis confirmed that {{there was a significant difference}} in the total coliform removal efficiency of <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> (p[*]<[*] 0.05).|$|R
50|$|<b>Ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> {{tend to be}} used at 10.7 MHz {{to provide}} {{selectivity}} in broadcast FM receivers, or at a lower frequency (455 kHz) as the second intermediate frequency filters in a communication receiver. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> at 455 kHz can achieve similar bandwidths to crystal filters at 10.7 MHz.|$|R
50|$|In rare cases, due to {{the even}} {{structure}} of the cakes formed, the steady flow profile of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> media and the gas free filtrate flow cake, washing {{has proved to be}} efficient in ceramic disc filters. The formation of thicker cakes during filtration and higher vacuum level leads to greater removal of solute.|$|E
50|$|Ceramic {{filtration}} {{does not}} remove chemical contaminants per se. However, some manufacturers (especially of ceramic candle filters) incorporate a high-performance activated carbon core inside the <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> cartridge that reduces organic & metallic contaminants. The active carbon absorbs compounds such as chlorine. Filters with active carbon {{need to be}} replaced periodically because the carbon becomes clogged with foreign material.|$|E
5000|$|For {{general purpose}} HF radio reception, a {{passband}} of about 6-20 kHz is acceptable. The receiver's overall bandwidth is not {{determined by the}} roofing filter but by a following crystal filter, mechanical filter or DSP filter. These allow a much better filtering curve than a roofing filter, which often uses a high first IF above 40 MHz. Roofing filters are usually crystal or <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> types.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} {{portable}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters,</b> {{such as the}} MSR Miniworks, which work via manual pumping, and in-line <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters,</b> which filters drinking water that comes through household plumbing. Cleaning these filters {{is the same as}} with the clay pot filter but also allows for reverse-flow cleaning, wherein clean water is forced through the filter backwards, pushing any contaminants out of the ceramic pores.|$|R
5000|$|Vacuum <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> are to {{be found}} in the {{following}} industries: ...|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Wine To Water responded by partnering with Filter Pure to distribute 500 ceramic water filters. The filters provide clean water {{for a family of}} 10 for up to five years. Along with Filter Pure, Wine to Water has also begun to build a Haitian run <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> factory to ensure clean water will continue to get to those who need it most.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{the vacuum}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> {{has proved to}} be a great innovation, there are still some {{limitations}} involved when operating the equipment. Ceramic filters exhibit large fluctuations in the recoiling washing pressure (0.05~0.35 MPa). This raises the short-term negative pressure and induces dilute acid due to the falling suck phenomenon. Therefore, the cleaning effect of the ceramic plates and the efficiency of the filter will be negatively affected.|$|E
50|$|Washing {{is largely}} {{restricted}} to the upper portions where the cake surface is nearly horizontal in orientation, which occurs at {{the temperature of the}} feed. The <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> uses a sintered alumina disc to dewater slurry under low vacuum. The dewatering occurs by drawing water from the slurry by capillary action. This ensures that no air or particles are drawn into the filter medium to cause blockage. However, if too much wash water is applied then it can cascade down the cake and into the feed trough, where it merely dilutes the slurry.|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} integrity of <b>ceramic</b> candle <b>filters</b> {{is a key}} element for hot gas cleanup systems, They protect the heat exchanger and gas turbine components from getting clogged and also prevent erosion. <b>Ceramic</b> candle <b>filters</b> used in the recent demonstration plant have experienced degradation and fracturing. Preliminary examination of these <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> indicated that damage of the filters may have resulted from strength degradation at consistent high temperature operation, thermal transient events, excessive ash accumulation and bridging and pulse cleaning. The <b>ceramic</b> candle <b>filter</b> is a slender structure made of layers of porous materials. The structure has high acoustic attenuation which has greatly limited the conventional ultrasonic detection capability. In general, stiffness reduction of a structure will cause the change of the modal parameters of the structure. This study proposes a nondestructive approach for evaluating the structural properties of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> using dynamic characterization method. The vibration signatures of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> at different degradation levels are established using transient impact-response technique. Results from this study indicate that the vibration signatures of the filters can be used as an index to quantify the darnage condition of the filters. The results also indicate the feasibility of using the vibration mode shapes to predict the damage location. The application of this study can be implemented to develop a nondestructive evaluation method for future in-situ inspection of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters...</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{least one}} manufacturer, MSR, offers a in-line <b>ceramic</b> based <b>filter,</b> {{allowing}} use of local water supplies for refill. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> can be cleaned {{at home by}} back flushing with clean water so no replacements are needed.|$|R
30|$|There is {{a slight}} {{decrease}} in the removal efficiency with the decrease in percentage composition of the saw dust {{in the production of}} filter elements; this might be due to the decrease in porosity of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters.</b> Adsorption of cations might be affected by the surface area in contact of adsorbent and adsorbate this surface area in contact increase for highly porous <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{improvement}} is applied at the regeneration stage when the residual filter cake is removed by back-flushing the clean plant water {{to wash the}} internal <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter.</b> Filter cake dewatering of ceramic filters produces low final cake moistures at minimum operation and maintenance costs. The residuals moisture are removed from the filter cake due to capillary action within the ceramic elements, which rotate above the slurry level. This process gives maximum filtration, and the final cake can be maintained at the lowest moisture content due to the effective cleaning of both ceramic sectors. In addition, performance can be optimized by using an ultrasonic cleaning system to achieve efficient operation conditions for regeneration of plates. The use of filtrate in looped water cycle in the design operation can reduce the water consumption up to 30-50%. High filtrate purity can be obtained, as there is only 0.001-0.005 g/l solids in the filtrate produced from this process. This eventually results in the reduction of polymer flocculant consumption in thickeners.Ceramic scraper knives have been introduced to this design as {{they are able to}} shave through the mass formed in filter cake dewatering. The remaining layer of solid residue on the filter provides protection from mechanical abrasion. Therefore, the maintenance costs can be reduced while the service life of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> increases.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} over other filtration systems is {{the reduction in}} energy consumption, up to 90% because no air flows through the discs due {{to the use of}} capillary force acting on the pores. Air breakthrough is prevented by the fine pores of the filter, thus allowing retention of higher vacuum levels. Therefore, the vacuum losses are less, which means the vacuum pump required is smaller than in conventional disc filters, thus minimizing operating costs. Power consumed by a vacuum <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> with 45 m2 of filtration area is 15 kW while 170 kW is consumed by similar filters with cloth membranes.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} design {{criteria}} which {{vary according to}} the type of disc and the required filtering capacity. The typical filter for extracting iron contains 12 ceramic filtering plates of the filtering elements (discs), which have a diameter of about 2705 mm, making the total filter surface 120 m2. This filter is most suited to filter feed slurries with high solid concentrations (5-20% w/w) and particles ranging in size from 1-700 µm. The area of the filters available in the <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> is up to 45 m2, making them useful for metal and mineral concentrate processing.|$|E
40|$|Effective high {{temperature}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> are indispensable in the advanced, coal based power systems (IGCC and PFBC). To meet the environmental particulate emission requirements and improve thermal efficiency, <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> are utilized to cleanup the hot gas particulate to protect downstream heat exchanger and gas turbine components from fouling and corrosion. The mechanical integrity of <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> and an efficient dust cake removal system {{are the key}} issues for hot gas cleanup systems. The filters must survive combined stresses due to mechanical, thermal, chemical and steam attack throughout normal operations (cold back pulse cleaning jets), unexpected excessive ash accumulation, and the start up and shut down conditions. To evaluate the design and performance of <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters,</b> different long term filter testing programs were conducted. To fulfill this purpose, two Advanced Particle Filter (APF) systems were complete at Tidd PFBC Demonstration Plant in Brilliant, Ohio in late 1990 {{as part of the}} Department of Energy`s (DOE) Clean Coal Technology Program. However, many filter failures 1649 were reported prior to its desired life time. In Tidd APF vessel, 28 filters failed one time, The objectives of this program were to provide an understanding of the factors pertinent to the failures of <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> by characterizing filter properties and the dust cake removal mechanism, Researches were emphasized on understanding of changes of filter properties and back pulse cleaning mechanism to resolve the issues relating to filter permeability variations, ash bridging and micro-thermal cracks induced during cold back pulse cleaning. To perform failure analysis of <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters,</b> thermal numerical simulation, material laboratory analysis on filter materials and dust cake, and measurements on filter properties and back pulse intensity along filter axis within a bench scale filter chamber were conducted...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{need for}} simple and {{inexpensive}} water supply systems in small communities, mainly because of high costs and water resource shortages. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> used as a Point-of-Use (POU) system could serve as a safe and inexpensive means for supplying water. In this research we looked at the possibility of using Iranian traditional ceramics as filters for drinking water, bearing in mind the importance of <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> as a POU system. A number of parameters relating to water quality were measured before and after filtration through a ceramic pipe wall. We used ceramic pipes made of clay (with 90 % purity). It turned out that <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> are capable of eliminating indicator microorganisms and turbidity to a considerable degree. They can also remove 70 % of the waters color. But this system could not eliminate Dissolved Solids, Electrical Conductivity, Hardness and the Nitrate ion content of water. Using Mann-Withney U Test and T- Test, it is confirmed that increasing the thickness and number of ceramic pipes is not effective for improving some water parameters. This research showed <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> can be useful for household water treatment in places where there is microbial pollution or high turbidity...|$|R
50|$|One {{improvement}} over the standard design of ceramic vacuum filter is to use serialized pore size distributions of non-fibrous porous ceramic filters. The porosity {{of this type of}} ceramic can be varied from 20% to 60% by volume, which allows a low-pressure drop of liquid and gas flow. Custom sizes from 1 mm diameter/0.5 mm bore of porous ceramic filters are available for a range of designs. A non-fibrous porous <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> is more resistant in alkaline and acidic conditions compared to fibrous ceramic filters. Thus, it has a longer service life as it has good wearing and erosion resistance as well as being able to withstand high temperatures.|$|E
