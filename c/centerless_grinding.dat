2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} {{a grinding}} machine using specially dressed grinding wheels matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread grinding and centerless thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the centerless thread grinding process is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding.</b> The blanks are hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common centerless thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for a [...] long set screw.|$|E

The larger one is used to grind the surface of the workpiece and the smaller wheel is used to regulate the axial movement of the workpiece.

50|$|<b>Centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> is a {{machining}} process that uses abrasive cutting to remove material from a workpiece. <b>Centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> differs from centered grinding operations in that no spindle or fixture {{is used to}} locate and secure the workpiece; the workpiece is secured between two rotary grinding wheels, and the speed of their rotation relative to each other determines {{the rate at which}} material is removed from the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} forms of <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding,</b> {{differentiated}} {{primarily by the}} method used to feed the workpiece through the machine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> uses {{purpose-built}} <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> machines. Such {{a machine}} will always include the grinding wheel, regulating wheel, and some means of supporting a workpiece. Modern machines may involve {{computer numerical control}} to allow automation and improve precision. Grinding wheels are interchangeable, to allow for different grits and shapes. Machines designed to accommodate through-feed grinding operations will allow {{the angle of the}} regulating wheel to be adjusted, to accommodate parts of different sizes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> is {{typically}} used in preference to other grinding processes for operations where many parts must be processed {{in a short}} time.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} {{different}} types of cylindrical grinding: outside diameter (OD) grinding, inside diameter (ID) grinding, plunge grinding, creep feed grinding, and <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding.</b>|$|E
50|$|In end-feed <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding,</b> the {{workpiece}} is fed axially {{into the machine}} {{on one side and}} comes to rest against an end stop; the grinding operation is performed, and then {{the workpiece}} is fed in the opposite direction to exit the machine. End-feed grinding is best for tapered workpieces.|$|E
50|$|<b>Centerless</b> <b>{{grinding}}</b> {{is a form}} of grinding {{where there}} is no collet or pair of centers holding the object in place. Instead, there is a regulating wheel positioned {{on the opposite side of}} the object to the grinding wheel. A work rest keeps the object at the appropriate height but has no bearing on its rotary speed. The workblade is angled slightly towards the regulating wheel, with the workpiece centerline above the centerlines of the regulating and grinding wheel; this means that high spots do not tend to generate corresponding opposite low spots, and hence the roundness of parts can be improved. <b>Centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> is much easier to combine with automatic loading procedures than centered grinding; throughfeed grinding, where the regulating wheel is held at a slight angle to the part so that there is a force feeding the part through the grinder, is particularly efficient.|$|E
50|$|In-feed <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> is used {{to grind}} {{workpieces}} with relatively complex shapes, such as an hourglass shape. Before the process begins, the workpiece is loaded manually into the grinding machine and the regulating wheel is moved into place. The complexity of the part shapes and grinding wheel shapes required to grind them accurately prevent the workpiece from being fed axially through the machine.|$|E
50|$|The process {{starts with}} a {{standard}} salt bath nitrocarburizing cycle, which produces a layer of Îµ iron nitride.Next, the workpiece is mechanically polished; typical polishing processes include vibratory finishing, lapping, and <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding.</b> Finally, the workpiece is re-immersed into the salt quench bath for 20 to 30 minutes, rinsed, and oil dipped. This last step optimizes the corrosion resistance by creating a layer of iron oxide about 3 to 4 micrometers thick. It also gives the workpiece a black finish.|$|E
5000|$|In {{through-feed}} <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding,</b> {{the workpiece}} is fed through the grinding wheels completely, entering {{on one side}} and exiting on the opposite. The regulating wheel in through-feed grinding is [...] away from the plane of the grinding wheel {{in such a way as}} to provide a lateral force component, feeding the workpiece through between the two wheels. Through-feed grinding can be very efficient because it does not require a separate feed mechanism; however, it can only be used for parts with a simple cylindrical shape.|$|E
50|$|Cylindrical {{grinding}} (also called center-type grinding) is used {{to grind}} the cylindrical surfaces and shoulders of the workpiece. The workpiece is mounted on centers and rotated by a device known as a drive dog or center driver. The abrasive wheel and the workpiece are rotated by separate motors and at different speeds. The table can be adjusted to produce tapers. The wheel head can be swiveled.The five types of cylindrical grinding are: outside diameter (OD) grinding, inside diameter (ID) grinding, plunge grinding, creep feed grinding, and <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding.</b>|$|E
50|$|The outer {{diameter}} (OD) {{of the races}} are often centerless ground using the throughfeed process. <b>Centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> can achieve a very high degree of accuracy, especially when done in stages. These stages are: rough, semi-finish and finish. Each grinding stage is designed to remove enough stock material from the casing so that the next stage does not encounter any problems such as burning or surface chatter, the finish stage achieves the final dimension. Each grinding wheel {{at all of the}} aforementioned stages has a varying degree of abrasive quality (finish being the finest grade) to achieve the appropriate stock removal for the next stage and final surface finish required.|$|E
50|$|In <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding,</b> the {{workpiece}} is held between two wheels, rotating {{in the same}} direction at different speeds, and a workholding platform. One wheel, known as the grinding wheel (stationary wheel in the diagram), is on a fixed axis and rotates such that the force applied to {{the workpiece}} is directed downward, against the workholding platform. This wheel usually performs the grinding action by having a higher tangential speed than the workpiece at the point of contact. The other wheel, known as the regulating wheel (moving wheel in the diagram), is movable. This wheel is positioned to apply lateral pressure to the workpiece, and usually has either a very rough or rubber-bonded abrasive to trap the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|The Ball and Roller Bearing Company, {{also known}} as American Family Crafts and the Joseph Nutt House and Machine Shop, is a {{historic}} industrial complex at 20-22 Maple Avenue in Danbury, Connecticut. The complex includes three buildings, {{two of which are}} wood frame and one which is brick. The two wood frame buildings include the Queen Anne-style former home of Joseph Nutt, who established a machine shop providing services to Danbury's hat making industry in 1886. Nutt's home also served as his company's office, and is attached to a single-story monitor-roofed brick structure. The factory is most notable as the location where Lewis Heim, owner of the Ball and Roller Bearing Company, invented the modern <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> machine in 1917.|$|E
50|$|Each casing {{exits the}} {{grinding}} zone onto a high speed conveyor that delivers them to whatever storage and/or inspection arrangement a manufacturer may have, inspection is also {{carried out by}} the operator of the centreless line, by checking finish appearance, diameter, squareness and roundness by use of a dial test indicator in varying configurations, size allowances are permitted but are extremely tight depending on the customers requirements and can vary plus or minus within micrometres of finish diameter, Sizes can be adjusted on all grinding stages via a compensation button which can be pushed to remove extra material in varying micrometre units, the grinding wheel can move away at the same compensation to make the casings bigger if so required if the casing size moves from the operators target, and as the grinding wheel wears. Because a <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> line has typically three grinding machines the operator must be in complete control and must prevent blockages in transfers, grinding exits and packing areas, also size and quality must constantly be checked, so the operator is always alert while operating the line and checking for problems and quality issues.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> is {{a widely}} used {{manufacturing}} process in the mass production of precision parts.

40|$|In {{this work}} a novel {{nonlinear}} model for <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> is presented. The model describes the dynamic {{behavior of the}} process.

40|$|The work {{described}} {{investigates the}} lobing and chatter behavior, and approaches to suppress lobing and chatter {{in order to}} improve the workpiece roundness in <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding.</b> The problem of workpiece out-of-roundness {{is one of the main}} limitations for the applications of <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> as a high rate precision machining process. Lobing and/or chatter most often is the source of the problem. This work models the <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> process as a causal system between the potential grinding disturbances and the resulting workpiece out-of-roundness, and develops approaches to set up a <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> operation such that the workpiece out-of-roundness is kept minimum under the potential grinding disturbances. ^ A general <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> process model is proposed. The model can be simplified for lobing and chatter analysis. A Bidiagrammatical method is proposed to investigate the lobing stability. It was found that the upper and lower lobing growth rate can be estimated through the Bidiagrammatical method, and the lobing growth exhibits periodicity over the lobing frequency. A relative stability diagram is thus developed to provide guidance such that a proper setup angle Î² can be selected to suppress lobing. ^ During grinding, two types of workpiece surface waves can be generated: (1) standing wave; and (2) precessing wave. It was found that the standing waves are less stable, therefore, often cause significant workpiece out-of-roundness problem. A work-speed regulation method is proposed such that only precessing waves are generated during grinding, therefore, reduce the workpiece out-of-roundness. ^ Chatter stability is investigated by using a similar Bidiagrammatical method. It was found that chatter stability can be approximately assessed through lobing stability. Therefore, approaches to lobing suppression can be equally applied to suppress chatter. ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> process {{demonstrates}} superior grinding accuracy with {{extremely high}} productivity, {{but only if}} the setup conditions are properly set up. Otherwise, various unfavorable phenomena manifest during the grinding processes and become serious obstacles to achieving that high quality and productivity. These phenomena are associated with the fundamental stabilities of the <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> system, so it is essential to keep the system stable by setting up the appropriate grinding conditions. This paper describes the development of a model for finding the setup conditions that simultaneously satisfy the three stability criteria of <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> systems: (1) work rotation stability for safe operations; (2) geometrical rounding stability for better roundness; and (3) dynamic system stability for chatter-free grinding. The objective of the model development is to produce combinations of optimal setup conditions as the outputs of the model, and to rank the priority of the outputs using PI (performance index) functions based on the process aims (productivity or accuracy). The paper demonstrates that the developed model, named Opt-Setup Master, can generate the optimum setup conditions to ensure safe operations, better roundness and chatter-free grinding. It provides practical setup conditions as well as scientific parameters and fundamental grinding parameters. Finally, the paper verifies that the Opt-Setup Master provides the setup conditions that simultaneously satisfy all three stability criteria of the <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> system...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to design an innovative vacuum-hydrostatic shoe to solve the workpiece lobing and shoe wear problems in <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> of bearing raceways so as to improve workpiece quality and dimensional accuracies and to reduce the machining cost. The shoe combines a vacuum pocket to a hydrostatic bearing, thus providing a non-contact, high stiffness and good load-carrying capacity workpiece support. Based on the kinematics and mechanics in shoe <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding,</b> the study provides theoretical analyses to systematically reveal the workpiece holding and rotating mechanisms of the planar frictional drivehead. It addresses workholding stability issue for the first time from the viewpoint of driving capacity and constraining capability which are the two contradictory sides of <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding.</b> Dynamic modeling is presented to correlate the lobing and chatter with machine setup parameters and process parameters in both time and frequency domains. A methodology is advanced for the design of vacuum-hydrostatic shoe. A computer model is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the vacuum-hydrostatic shoe in improving workpiece roundness through lobing control. Experimental results show that with the vacuum-hydrostatic shoe, the geometric and workholding instabilities are effectively eliminated or suppressed, which in turn improves workpiece geometric accuracies and surface finish. The shoe has made possible high speed, wear and thermal damage free workpiece support for shoe <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> due to its non-contact support mechanism. With the application of the vacuum-hydrostatic shoe, the shoe <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> process becomes insensitive to the critical parameters, such as offset and shoe setup angles. As a result, the roundness error of a typical bearing raceway of 42 mm in diameter is significantly reduced from the current level of 1. 0 Î¼m to 0. 2 Î¼m. ...|$|E

40|$|Through-feed <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> is a {{precision}} finishing process used to manufacture circular components. This dissertation investigates the workpiece shape generating mechanism in the through-feed <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> process. Specifically, the workpiece lobing mechanism and axial guidance through the grinding gap were studied. ^ To study the workpiece lobing mechanism, a computer simulation of the plunge <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> process was developed. This simulation was experimentally verified {{by comparing the}} harmonic spectra of simulated workpieces with the spectra of workpieces ground with similar set-up parameters. The simulation correctly predicted which frequencies on the workpiece surface were more susceptible to roundness errors than others. These results were found to also be compatible with a previous linear lobing model (ZHOU 94). The plunge lobing analysis was then extended to the through-feed case {{by means of an}} average growth rate chart. This chart characterizes the workpiece lobing stability for a given through-feed set-up. Again, experimental studies were conducted to verify the accuracy of this model and it was determined that the average growth rate chart was effective in assessing the workpiece lobing stability for the case of short workpieces like bearing rings. ^ To address the problem of controlling the workpiece cylindrical form, a simulation of the workpiece supporting system was developed. These results confirmed the accuracy of previous researcher 2 Ì 7 s analytical estimates of the proper regulating wheel shape.

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation method for investigating the form generation mechanism in the <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> process is described. In this work, instantaneous {{change of the}} apparent depth of cut during grinding was modeled using absolute coordinate systems. The result of the simulation was not affected by the coordinate system (the location of the reference circle center and the radius of the reference circle). Also, analytical models of the interference phenomena at the contact points were developed to investigate their effects on the roundness profile of a centerless ground workpiece. In order to {{study the effects of}} grinding variables on grinding mechanism, details of the machining factor were formulated using such process variables as grinding wheel speed, wheel specification, regulating wheel speed, dressing condition, etc. A least squares contact line was formulated to include the effect of workpiece orientation relative to the grinding machine. Using these formulas, 2 -D, 3 -D infeed, and 3 -D through-feed <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> simulation models were developed. For the 3 -D through-feed simulation model, grinding forces of previous and/or following workpieces were assumed {{as a function of the}} current workpiece location. ^ The experiments and {{computer simulation}}s were carried out using three types of cylindrical workpiece shapes with varying flat length. To validate these models, simulation results were compared with the experimental results. It was found that the number of lobes and the angular displacement of peaks and corresponding valleys of the simulation results were identical with those of the roundness profiles of ground workpieces. Through 2 -D simulation, it was verified that grinding wheel interference is affected not only by geometry but also by machine elasticity. 3 -D simulation results revealed that the effect of flat end is propagated to the opposite end through workpiece reorientation. It was shown that the inherent tapering error of the through-feed <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> exists. The effects of the center height angle (Î²), the number of workpiece rotations, the regulating wheel tilt angle (Ï), and the slope of the grinding wheel inlet crown on the geometric tolerance of a cylindrically centerless ground workpiece were investigated. ...|$|E
