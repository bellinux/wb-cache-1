25|$|USA Today has {{traditionally}} maintained a policy not to endorse {{candidates for the}} United States Presidency or any other state or federal political office, which it has refrained from doing since its inception. Since 1984, its political editorials during the Presidential election cycle has focused instead on providing opinion on major issues relevant to the campaign based on the differing concerns of voters, the vast amount of information on ongoing Presidential campaigns, and the Board of Contributors' aim to provide a fair viewpoint through the diverse political ideologies of its members and avoid reader perceptions of bias. However, the board re-evaluates its non-endorsement policy through an independent process during each four-year election cycle, with any decision to circumvent the policy based on a <b>consensus</b> <b>vote</b> in which fewer than two of the editorial board's members dissent or hold differing opinions.|$|E
25|$|The Committee {{will have}} both an {{advisory}} and decision-making nature; with powers {{to submit proposals}} as well. It will be competent, inter alia, to: follow up on the integration process and keep the respective Congresses informed; Take the necessary steps for the future instatement of a Mercosur Parliament; Organize subcommittees to examine matters relating to the integration process; Submit its recommendations to the Common Market Council and Group {{as to how the}} integration process should be conducted and Southern Common Market formed; Make the adjustments necessary to harmonize the laws of the different member states and submit them to the respective Congresses; Establish relationships with private entities in each of the member states, as well as international agencies and bureaus so as to obtain information and specialized assistance with matters of interest: Establish relationships targeting cooperation with Congresses of the nonmember nations and entities involved in regional integration schemes; Subscribe to cooperation and technical assistance accords with public and/or private entities whether domestic, supranational or international. The Committee will be composed of a maximum of 64 acting parliamentary members, 16 per member state, and an equal number of alternates, appointed by the Congress to which they pertain, and with a term of office of at least two years. The meetings shall be conducted by a directors' board consisting of four presidents (one for each member state). The Committee will ordinarily meet twice a year, and extraordinarily whenever summoned by any of its five presidents. Meetings are held in the territory of each member state on a successive and alternating basis. Decision Making: Meetings of the Joint Parliamentary Committee will only be valid when attended by parliamentary delegations from all member states.

This was also compared with another hybrid fault-tolerant scheme called Acceptance Voting, using dynamic versions of <b>consensus</b> and majority <b>voting.</b> <b>Consensus</b> <b>voting</b> provides adaptation of the voting strategy to varying component reliability, failure correlation, and output space characteristics. Since failure correlation among versions effectively reduces the cardinality of the space in which the voter make decisions, <b>consensus</b> <b>voting</b> is usually preferable to simple majority voting in any fault-tolerant system.

30|$|<b>Consensus</b> <b>voting</b> is {{more stable}} than {{majority}} voting and always offers reliability at least equivalent to majority voting (McAllister and Vouk [1996]; Vouk et al. [1993]). Nevertheless, in terms of implementation, the <b>consensus</b> <b>voting</b> algorithm {{is more complex than}} the majority one, since the <b>consensus</b> <b>voting</b> algorithm requires multiple comparisons (Lee and Anderson [1990]). Blough performed a study on the effectiveness of voting algorithms (Blough and Sullivan [1990]). He states that the median voter is expected to perform better than the mean voting strategy. He also shows the overall superiority of the median strategy over the majority voting scheme (Blough and Sullivan [1990]). Furthermore, under circumstances in which some or all variants might not produce their results (e.g. some or all variants not providing their results within the maximum expected time frame; catastrophic failure of {{some or all of the}} variants), dynamic voters are the best option since they can process zero to n inputs. Finally, acceptance tests, exact majority, consensus and dynamic voters can process any type of variant outputs, while the remaining adjudicators must receive inputs in an ordered space (Pullum [2001]).|$|R

30|$|When {{dealing with}} greater {{variability}} in variant service interfaces, a straightforward <b>consensus</b> <b>voting</b> mechanism may not suffice. Some solutions accept {{a certain amount}} of variability and agree that a consensus is formed with multiple equivalent results. The solution by Dillen et al. ([2012]) supports formal <b>consensus</b> <b>voting,</b> called plurality voting in their paper. For each invocation of the scheme, the variant services will be partitioned based on the equivalence of their results. The result associated to the largest cluster will be accepted as the correct result (Dillen et al. [2012]). Abdeldjelil et al. ([2011],[2012]) describe a specific voting algorithm, called equivalence vote, that will decide if multiple concurrent service responses are equivalent or not. This is based on a pre-agreed amount of deviation for answers to be considered equivalent. Their algorithm requires the input to be an ordered set of equivalent results and also for the acceptable functional deviation to be specified.|$|R
40|$|A key aspect for any greedy pursuit {{algorithm}} used in compressed sensing {{is a good}} support-set detection method. For distributed compressed sensing, {{we consider}} a setup where many sensors measure sparse signals that are correlated via {{the existence of a}} signals' intersection support-set. This intersection support-set is called the joint support-set. Estimation of the joint support-set has a high impact on the performance of a distributed greedy pursuit algorithm. This estimation can be achieved by exchanging local support-set estimates followed by a (<b>consensus)</b> <b>voting</b> method. In this paper we endeavor for a probabilistic analysis of two democratic voting principle that we call majority and <b>consensus</b> <b>voting.</b> In our analysis, we first model the input/output relation of a greedy algorithm (executed locally in a sensor) by a single parameter known as probability of miss. Based on this model, we analyze the voting principles and prove that the democratic voting principle has a merit to detect the joint support-set.

30|$|According to Buys et al. ([2011]), their solution, called A-NVP composite, {{supports}} majority voting. However, {{for similar}} reasons to the Gotze et al. classification we decided their solution instead supports a dynamic majority voter. Moreover, the response latency of the A-NVP composite is guaranteed {{not to exceed}} a maximum response time defined by the client. If no absolute majority could be established before the maximum response time, an exception will be issued to signal that consensus {{could not be found}} (Buys et al. [2011]). In addition, according to Townend et al. ([2005]), their solution supports different types of voting algorithms to choose from. However, we inferred that the dynamic <b>consensus</b> <b>voting</b> is the only decision mechanism supported. The voter is dynamic as it can process 0 to n results, where n is the number of executed variant services. Specifically, the voting discards results of any variant service whose weighting falls below a user-defined value and subsequently performs <b>consensus</b> <b>voting</b> on the remaining results. The weighting is based on the confidence of that service returning a correct result.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To develop {{preliminary}} {{criteria for}} inactive disease and clinical remission for select categories of {{juvenile idiopathic arthritis}} (JIA), and to decide what such clinical states should predict in terms of probability of disease recurrence. METHODS: A Delphi serial questionnaire consensus-formation approach was used initially to gather criteria in use by pediatric rheumatologists (PR) for defining clinical remission in oligoarticular (persistent and extended), rheumatoid factor (RF) positive and negative polyarticular, and systemic JIA. Results from sequential questionnaires provided an agenda for a nominal group technique (NGT) conference to reach consensus on unresolved questions. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty PR from 34 countries responded to the questionnaires and 20 PR from 9 countries attended the conference. Draft criteria for inactive disease include the following: no active arthritis; no fever, rash, serositis, splenomegaly, or generalized lymphadenopathy attributable to JIA; no active uveitis; normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein; and a physician's global assessment of disease activity rated at the best score possible for the instrument used. According to <b>consensus</b> <b>vote,</b> 6 continuous months of inactive disease on medication defines clinical remission on medication, while 12 months of inactive disease off all anti-arthritis (and anti-uveitis) medications defines clinical remission off medication. The finalized criteria for remission off medication ideally should predict that a patient has </= 20 % probability of disease recurrence within the next 5 years. CONCLUSION: Using consensus formation techniques, we formulated preliminary criteria for inactive disease and clinical remission on and off medication for use in select categories of JIA.

40|$|Performing {{a search}} on the World Wide Web (WWW) and {{traversing}} the resulting links is an adventure {{in which one}} encounters both credible and incredible web pages. Search engines, such as Google, rely on macroscopic Web topology patterns and even highly ranked â€˜authoritativeâ€™ web sites may be a mixture of informed and uninformed opinions. Without credibility heuristics to guide the user in a maze of facts, assertions, and inferences, the Web remains an ineffective knowledge delivery platform. This report presents the design and implementation of a modular extension to the popular Google search engine, MEDQUAL, which provisions both URL and content-based heuristic credibility rules to reorder raw Google rankings in the medical domain. MEDQUAL, a software system written in Java, starts with a bootstrap configuration file which loads in basic heuristics in XML format. It then provides a subscription mechanism so users can join birds of feather specialty groups, for example Pediatrics, in order to load specialized heuristics as well. The platform features a coordination mechanism whereby information seekers can effectively become secondary authors, contributing by <b>consensus</b> <b>vote</b> additional credibility heuristics. MEDQUAL uses standard XML namespace conventions to divide opinion groups so that competing groups can be supported simultaneously. The net effect is a merger of basic and supplied heuristics so that the system continues to adapt and improve itself over time to changing web content, changing opinions, and new opinion groups. The key goal of leveraging the intelligence of a large-scale and diffuse WWW user community is met and we conclude by discussing our plans to develop MEDQUAL further and evaluate it.

So this paper proposes a heuristic classifier ensemble to improve the performance of classification learning. It is specially deal with multiclass problems which their aim is to learn the boundaries of each class from many other classes. Based on the concept of multiclass problems classifiers are divided into two different categories: pairwise classifiers and multiclass classifiers. The aim of a pairwise classifier is to separate one class from another one. Because of pairwise classifiers just train for discrimination between two classes, decision boundaries of them are simpler and more effective than those of multiclass classifiers. The main idea behind the proposed method is to focus classifier in the erroneous spaces of problem and use of pairwise classification concept instead of multiclass classification concept. Indeed although usage of pairwise classification concept instead of multiclass classification concept is not new, we propose a new pairwise classifier ensemble with a very lower order. In this paper, first the most confused classes are determined and then some ensembles of classifiers are created. The classifiers of each of these ensembles jointly work using majority weighting votes. The results of these ensembles are combined to decide the final vote in a weighted manner.
