5000|$|Although {{the design}} of the entire S3G reactor plant (<b>core,</b> <b>piping,</b> pumps, etc.) saw only limited use, a design version of the reactor core ("S3G3" [...] or [...] "S3G core 3") was later used for {{replacement}} cores for the Navy's 100 S5W reactor plants when refueled. Another unique feature of the S3G core 3 was the use of [...] "Y" [...] shaped control rods versus the standard cruciform control rods used in the S5W core. The core also utilized a rod configuration called [...] "skewed divergent" [...] for ease of maintenance.|$|R

50|$|The MSRE's <b>piping,</b> <b>core</b> vat and {{structural}} components {{were made from}} Hastelloy-N and its moderator was a pyrolytic graphite core. The fuel for the MSRE was LiF-BeF2-ZrF4-UF4 (65-29-5-1), the graphite core moderated it, and its secondary coolant was FLiBe (2LiF-BeF2), it operated as hot as 650 °C and operated for {{the equivalent of about}} 1.5 years of full power operation.|$|R
25|$|The MSRE {{was located}} at ORNL. Its <b>piping,</b> <b>core</b> vat and {{structural}} components {{were made from}} Hastelloy-N, moderated by pyrolytic graphite.

25|$|One {{additional}} design {{weakness of}} the two-fluid design was its complex plumbing.

More recent research has put into question the need for complex interleaving graphite tubing, suggesting a simple elongated tube-in-shell reactor would allow high total reactor power without complex tubing.|$|R

25|$|On 14 September at 11AM (JST) TEPCO began injecting {{water into}} the No. 2 reactor using the <b>core</b> spray system <b>piping</b> in {{addition}} to the feed water piping already being used as this method seemed to be effective in reducing the temperature in the No. 3 reactor. At that time the temperature {{at the bottom of the}} No. 2 reactor was still 114.4 degrees Celsius (237.92°F), compared to the 84.9°C degrees(184.82°F) in the No.1 reactor and the 101.3°C (214.34°F) in the No. 3 reactor. The new method has led to some temperature decrease, but not as significant as the decrease that occurred in the No.3 reactor.|$|R

25|$|In August, TEPCO began {{considering}} {{changing the}} core injection method for the no. 3 reactor {{as it was}} requiring a much larger quantity of water to cool and the temperatures remained relatively high compared to the nos. 1 and 2 reactors which required far less water. TEPCO has hypothesized {{that this may be}} because some fuel is still present above the core support plate inside the pressure vessel of the no. 3 reactor in addition to the fuel that has fallen {{to the bottom of the}} pressure vessel. The fuel on the bottom would be easily cooled by the existing method, but as the pressure vessel is leaking, any fuel located on the support plate was likely only being cooled due to the steam generated by the cooling of the melted fuel at the bottom. TEPCO began considering utilizing the reactor's core spray system pipes as an additional path of water injection and then reduce the amount of water through the existing feedwater piping system. A team of workers were sent inside the reactor building to inspect the core spray system pipes and it was found that the piping was undamaged. Hoses were then run from the temporary injection pumps located outside the building and connected to the <b>core</b> spray system <b>piping.</b> On 1 September, TEPCO began injecting water using the new route. The new injection method has been considerably effective in lowering the temperature of the reactor to below 100 degrees Celsius. As of 27 September, most of the no. 3 reactor's temperature readings are between 70–80 degrees Celsius. Later, TEPCO began utilizing the same method in the no. 2 reactor; it has not had as significant effect on the no. 2 reactor as it did on the no. 3.|$|R
40|$|Radioactive supernate, salt, and/or sludge wastes (i. e., {{high level}} wastes) are {{confined}} in 49 underground storage tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The waste is transported between tanks {{within and between}} the F and H area tank farms and other facilities on site via underground and {{a limited number of}} aboveground transfer lines. The Department of Energy - Savannah River Operations Office (DOE-SR) performed a comprehensive assessment of the structural integrity program for the Tank Farm waste transfer system at the SRS. This document addresses the following issues raised during the DOE assessment: (1) Inspections of failed or replaced transfer lines indicated that the wall thickness of some <b>core</b> and jacket <b>piping</b> is less than nominal; (2) No corrosion allowance is utilized in the transfer line structural qualification calculations. No basis for neglecting corrosion was provided in the calculations; (3) Wall loss due to erosion is not addressed in the transfer line structural qualification calculations; and (4) No basis is provided for neglecting intergranular stress corrosion cracking in the transfer line structural qualification calculations. The common theme in most of these issues is the need to assess the potential for occurrence of material degradation of the transfer line piping. The approach used to resolve these issues involved: (1) Review the design and specifications utilized to construct and fabricate the piping system; (2) Review degradation mechanisms for stainless steel and carbon steel and determine their relevance to the transfer line piping; (3) Review the transfer piping inspection data; (4) Life estimation calculations for the transfer lines; and (5) A Fitness-For-Service evaluation for one of the transfer line jackets. The evaluation concluded that the transfer line system piping has performed well for over fifty years. Although there have been instances of failures of the stainless steel core pipe during off-normal service, no significant degradation is anticipated during normal operations for the planned service life. General corrosion of stainless steel in high level waste environments was shown to be insignificant (i. e., little or no wall loss is expected for a time on the order of 180 years or more). Erosion is also not expected to limit the life of the pipes due to the low usage of the transfer lines and low fluid velocity during transfers. Quality controls on the material (e. g., corrosion evaluation testing) and procedures/specifications that limit contact with chloride bearing materials or liquids minimize the potential for the occurrence of stress corrosion cracking of the core pipe. General corrosion of the carbon steel jacket is not expected to be significant for a reasonable intended service life (e. g., on the order of 170 years). However, the carbon steel jackets are expected to continue to fail in local areas due to pitting corrosion. Life prediction estimates project that {{a significant increase in the}} number of jacket failures (i. e., through-wall penetrations) may occur after an additional 30 to 60 years of service life (i. e., between 2035 and 2065). A Fitness-For-Service evaluation was performed for a recently inspected jacket that showed evidence of pitting within a locally thinned area. The evaluation concluded that the line is still able to perform its intended function and can remain in service...|$|R
