50|$|Bob Hope Chrysler Classic - From 2003-06, USA Network {{covered the}} early action.

However, when Golf Channel took over coverage, the network only assigned live coverage to PGA West (both the Palmer and Nicklaus courses). All other courses used did not receive live coverage at all, with an hourly highlights package sent in and played, {{but none of it}} live. This has been the approach consistently taken by Golf Channel in regards to tournaments with multiple courses, including the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am and the Walt Disney World Golf Classic.

5000|$|On June 8, 2015, it was {{announced}} that NBC and Golf Channel had acquired rights to The Open Championship under a 12-year deal, replacing ESPN. The R&A was, reportedly, won over by NBC's rights fee (which is approximately doubled in comparison to ESPN), and the performance of NBC's broadcasts of the Premier League, which air in a similar weekend morning time slot in the U.S.. The deal restored a men's major back to NBC {{for the first time since}} 2014, gave Golf <b>Channel</b> <b>coverage</b> of its first-ever major, and returned the Open to broadcast network television. Originally stated to begin in 2017, it was reported on October 12, 2015 that ESPN had opted out the final year of its contract to NBC, thus causing NBC coverage to begin in 2016 instead, mirroring a similar move by the BBC to also opt out of what would have been its final year of Open coverage to new rightsholder Sky Sports.

40|$|A {{constantly}} available {{control channel}} facilitates control message exchange and spectrum coordination in cognitive radio (CR) ad hoc networks. When a dedicated control channel is unavailable, a control channel must be dynamically allocated in licensed channels and vacated {{for the presence}} of primary users (PUs). As a result, the establishment of such a control channel is a challenge. In this paper, an efficient recovery control channel (ERCC) design is proposed to address this challenge. This heuristic and distributed design approach is essentially based on the observed spectrum homogeneity in a neighborhood. By adaptively updating a list of channels commonly available to neighbors, each secondary user is able to efficiently establish new control channels among neighbors in response to PU activity changes. Therefore, a virtually “always on” control channel robust to PU activity can be realized by the proposed method. The contributions are summarized as follows: 1) The proposed method efficiently recovers control channels from PU activity changes and maintains network connectivity. 2) It extends the control <b>channel</b> <b>coverage</b> to facilitate broadcast and reduce control overhead and delay. 3) It minimizes the interference with PUs. Simulation results show that the proposed solution outperforms the classic group- and sequence-based solutions in the responsiveness to rapidly changing PU activity and the maintenance of connectivity. Furthermore, the increase in control <b>channel</b> <b>coverage</b> and the allocation of the highest quality channels to control channels can be well balanced with reliability and scalability in various network scenarios...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} a model giving new insight into {{electrokinetic}} fluid flow in microfluidic devices, and demonstrate its use {{as a tool for}} designing capillary electrophoresis (CE) systems; particularly lab-on-a-chip applications. The electroosmotic flow (EOF) {{is directly related to the}} zeta-potential which can be dynamically modified by applying a potential to a zeta-potential modification (ZPM) electrode close to the channel wall [1]. We investigate the effect on EOF where the zeta-potential is modified along a single channel wall, rather than complete <b>channel</b> <b>coverage.</b> We consider the effect for a single channel wall because it makes the fabrication process simpler. The EOF affects the amount of separation attainable in CE systems for a given channel length. We show that with control of the EOF, separations can be achieved in channels of shorter length. The use of a single electrode introduces peak broadening; we investigate the effect this has on the separation and the limits it places on the separation enhancement method...|$|E
40|$|Emerging {{vehicular}} safety applications require {{low latency}} communications and reliable packet dissemination for life saving safety messages. Significant developments {{have taken place}} {{over the past few}} years. IEEE WAVE and ISO CALM have been developed as international standards for ITS applications. Both WAVE and CALM support multichannel operations and use CSMA/CA as channel access mechanism. WAVE may impose a latency of 54 milliseconds for enabling multi-channel operations. CSMA/CA method can experience unpredictable delay and packet drop when channel is congested. In this paper, we propose an innovative technique to increase <b>channel</b> <b>coverage</b> and reduce latency for safety messages in multi-channel vehicular environments. We also propose an efficient congestion control protocol for vehicular communication networks that use CSMA/CA channel access mechanism. The proposed congestion control protocol guarantees that safety messages gain channel access while contending with other messages. Technologies presented in this paper improve reliability of the safety message dissemination and reduce latency for safety message transmission...|$|E
40|$|In a {{wireless}} communications network {{served by a}} high altitude platform (HAP) the cochannel interference {{is a function of}} the antenna beamwidth, angular separation and. sidelobe level. At the millimeter wave frequencies proposed for HAPs, an array of aperture type antennas on the platform is a practicable solution for serving the cells. We present a method for predicting cochannel interference based on curve-fit approximations for radiation patterns of elliptic beams which illuminate cell edges with optimum power, and a means of estimating optimum beamwidths for each cell of a regular hexagonal layout. The method is then applied to a 121 cell architecture. Where sidelobes are modeled As a flat floor at 40 -dB below peak directivity, a cell cluster size of four yields carrier-to-interference ratios (CIRs), which vary from 15 dB at cell edges to 27 dB at cell centers. On adopting a cluster size of seven, these figures increase, respectively, to 19 and 30 dB. On reducing the sidelobe level, the. improvement in CIR can be quantified. The method also readily allows for regions of overlapping <b>channel</b> <b>coverage</b> to be shown...|$|E
