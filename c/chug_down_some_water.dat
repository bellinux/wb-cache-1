50|$|Later, a Senator {{speaks to}} Congress, {{telling the story}} of a town in his state where the gangsters were put out of {{business}} when the people stormed the brewery. He calls for an end to Prohibition. After the headline “Beer Legalized”, crowds cheer, grain gets harvested, and beer gets made and delivered. At Butt's Beer Garden, Elmer and Jimmy arrive in an open car. Jimmy offers free beer, and the two get mobbed for autographs. The crowd steals their clothes, too. Hortense joins and asks if Elmer is hurt - he isn't. Jimmy, holding a frosty brew aloft, addresses the camera: “It's your turn next folks. It won't be long now.” He blows off the head and <b>chugs</b> <b>some</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} noon {{that they had the}} {{so-called}} raft built and the biplane fastened to it. The work had made them all hungry and they were glad that they had brought along a substantial lunch. They sat down {{in the shade of the}} woods to eat, washing the meal <b>down</b> with <b>some</b> <b>water</b> from a spring back of the old hut,--or rather of what was now left of the structure. While the boys ate they talked about Josiah Crabtree and Tad Sobber and the others who were their enemies.|$|R

He had been to Jerusalem to worship (Acts 8:27), and was {{returning}} home. The eunuch was sitting in his chariot reading the Book of Isaiah, and had come to Isaiah 53:7-8. Philip asked the Ethiopian, [...] "Do you understand what you are reading?" [...] He said he did not ("How can I understand unless I have a teacher to teach me?"), and asked Philip to explain the text to him. Philip told him the Gospel of Jesus, and the Ethiopian asked to be baptized. They went <b>down</b> into <b>some</b> <b>water</b> and Philip baptized him.|$|R
6000|$|The Princess Alicia, who {{happened}} to be looking in at the chamber-door, asking about breakfast, was very much alarmed when she saw her Royal Mamma in this state, and she rang the bell for Peggy, which {{was the name of the}} Lord Chamberlain. But remembering where the smelling-bottle was, she climbed on a chair and got it, and after that she climbed on another chair by the bedside and held the smelling-bottle to the Queen's nose, and after that she jumped <b>down</b> and got <b>some</b> <b>water,</b> and after that she jumped up again and wetted the Queen's forehead, and, in short, when the Lord Chamberlain came in, that dear old woman said to the little Princess, [...] "What a Trot you are!

60|$|It was, however, {{obvious that}} the men in camp could not help much and he nerved himself to make a hard choice. If he held on, all the canoes would go down the rapid; if he let two go, one might be saved. He cut the line made fast astern, the log and canoes vanished, and he and the Indian {{strained}} their muscles. They had lost ground they could not recover; the gravel bank was sliding past, and angry waves leaped about the rocks below. Somehow they must make the bank before they were carried <b>down.</b> There was <b>some</b> <b>water</b> in the canoe; Jim heard it splash about. She was horribly heavy and his pole would not grip the bottom. When it slipped the current washed its end under the craft.|$|R
50|$|Blart patrols {{the mall}} on a Segway to assure things {{are safe and}} clean. He goes to the {{surveillance}} room and trains Veck Simms (Keir O'Donnell), who is new but uninterested on the job. Meanwhile, Blart eventually becomes acquainted with Amy Anderson (Jayma Mays), the vendor of a new kiosk. He meets her one evening at a restaurant with other mall employees. Things initially go well, but Blart is sidetracked when he decides {{to participate in a}} nacho-eating contest with his friend Leon (Jamal Mixon). The hot sauce is more than Blart can handle, and he begins <b>chugging</b> <b>down</b> several alcoholic beverages causing him to become excessively drunk and incoherent. He crashes the party and makes a wild exit by falling through a window.|$|R
60|$|Soon after {{everything}} was ready the monkey jumped {{down from his}} tree, and creeping to the door began a long hypocritical speech, asking pardon for all he had done. He waited for an answer of some sort, but none came. He listened, but all was still; then he peeped, and saw no one; then he went in. He peered about for the crab, but in vain; however, his eyes fell on the egg, which he snatched up and set on the fire. But in a moment the egg had burst into a thousand pieces, and its sharp shell struck {{him in the face}} and scratched him horribly. Smarting with pain he ran to the bucket and stooped <b>down</b> to throw <b>some</b> <b>water</b> over his head. As he stretched out his hand up started the wasp and stung him on the nose. The monkey shrieked and ran to the door, but as he passed through down fell the mortar and struck him dead. 'After that the crab lived happily for many years, and at length died in peace under her own kaki tree.|$|R
50|$|In {{the console}} version, the player {{can play with}} three {{computers}} and no other human players, or with a friend or two with the remaining computer(s).

50|$|The {{pickup truck}} {{depicted}} in the series is a 1951 Ford F1. It was purchased at auction after the series ended and was later leased back to NBC for the spin offs Sanford Arms and Sanford. It has changed hands a few times over the years, eventually purchased by a real life junk dealer, Donald Dimmitt of Dimmitts Auto Salvage, in Argos, Indiana. Most recently it was purchased from Dimmitts Auto Salvage by Tim Franko and Jeff Canter, owners of BlueLine Classics, a classic car dealership in North Royalton, Ohio. The truck has been preserved by BlueLine Classics to its true condition as seen on the TV series and is proudly displayed in the BlueLine Classics showroom. It is often seen at car shows or <b>chugging</b> <b>down</b> the road in Ohio driven by the proud owners.|$|R

500|$|Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{praised the}} episode structure, writing [...] "The quick {{transitions}} and constant back-and-forth movement among subplots generated more energy that, {{when combined with}} several characters we either didn't know before or hadn't {{seen in a long}} time, made [...] "The Broken Man" [...] feel livelier." [...] Similarly, Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph also praised the episode, noting, [...] "Once again there was a sense Game of Thrones was steeling itself for battles - and expensive set-pieces - <b>chugging</b> <b>down</b> the track. A storm is brewing - for now, we were invited to enjoy what remains of the calm." [...] Jen Chaney of Vulture also felt the episode was more of a set up episode for storylines to be resolved in the close of the season, writing [...] "Although two bombs get dropped in this week's episode of Game of Thrones, it's an hour focused on putting the narrative chess pieces into place. [...] "The Broken Man" [...] doesn't finish off any of its major moves. Those bold turns are yet to come." ...|$|R
