40|$|The {{availability}} of a complete and accurate phase diagram is an essential requirement if {{a full understanding of}} the properties, and hence the potential applications, of an alloy system is to be gained. Although the general nature of the tungsten-platinum <b>constitutional</b> <b>diagram</b> has been known for many years, it is now apparent that intermediate phases which are not incorporated in the published phase diagrams may exist, and evidence to support this is presented. It might be expected that the combination of the highest melting point metal {{with one of the most}} oxidation resistant would result in materials with particularly useful technological properties, but few applications have in fact been found for alloys of tungsten with platinum. One such application is the composi-tion containing 4 weight per cent tungsten an...|$|E
40|$|Perfect liquid mixing but no solid {{diffusion}} {{is assumed}} in normal freezing. In addition, the molar compositions of the freezing solid and remaining liquid, respectively, follow the solidus and liquidus curves of the <b>constitutional</b> <b>diagram.</b> For the linear case, {{in which both}} the liquidus and solidus are perfectly straight lines, the normal freezing equation giving the fraction solidified at each melt temperature and the solute concentration profile in the frozen solid was determined as early as 1902, and has since been repeatedly published. Corresponding equations for quadratic, cubic or higher-degree liquidus and solidus lines have also been obtained. The equation of normal freezing for ideal ternary liquid solutions solidified into ideal solid solutions of the pseudobinary type is given. Sample computations {{with the use of}} this new equation were made and are given for the Ga-Al-As system...|$|E
40|$|Hume-Rothery’s {{breadth of}} {{knowledge}} {{combined with a}} quest for generality gave him insights into the reasons for solubility in metallic systems that have become known as Hume-Rothery’s Rules. Presented with solubility details from similar sets of <b>constitutional</b> <b>diagrams,</b> can one expect artificial neural networks (ANN), which are blind to the underlying metals physics, to reveal similar or better correlations? The aim is to test whether it is feasible to predict solid solubility limits using ANN with the parameters that Hume-Rothery identified. The {{results indicate that the}} correlations expected by Hume-Rothery’s Rules work best for a certain range of copper or silver alloy systems. The ANN can predict a value for solubility, which is a refinement on the original qualitative duties of Hume-Rothery’s Rules. The best combination of input parameters can also be evaluated by ANN. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the uranium-carbon system has been made and a <b>constitutional</b> <b>diagram</b> drawn {{on the basis of}} melting point, x-ray, and metallographic data. Three carbides of uranium have been detected and identified: UC, U~Ca, and UC 2. No com-pounds have been found containing a carbon content higher than that of UC~. UC and UC 2 are completely soluble in each other at elevated temperatures, forming a solid solution. The solid solution phase cannot be retained on cooling to room temperature in alloys containing between about 5. 0 to 9. 0 weight per cent carbon. A Widmanstiitten type of precipitation takes place on cooling, leaving either UC precipitated in a UC~ matrix or vice versa, depending on the carbon content of the alloy. In alloys contain-ing above about 9. 0 weight per cent total carbon, UC can quite effectively be retained in solid solution by quenching from temperatures above about 1800...|$|E
40|$|Here is {{investigated}} an golden alloy 585 {{as one of}} {{widely used}} gold alloy in jewelry production. Insufficient data, even in nowadays, exist about the production schedule of gold alloys, including melting, rolling and heat treatment regimes. The structures of complex alloys, such as used golden alloy, are less known and/or investigated. Principally, the <b>constitutional</b> <b>diagram</b> of Au-Ag-Cu system is known, as a (meta) stable equilibrium diagram. But, after relatively fast cooling from liquid state during casting will be obtained polycrystalline grains, different from equilibrium conditions. Such polycrystalline material frequently undergoes to rolling for obtaining a desired shape of (semi) product. Those processes, casting and rolling, will show the influence on the final structure to be obtained, also on properties of such treated alloy. The structural changes and obtained phases in metal working processes of 585 gold alloy still are not well examined, so here is provided an XRD examination after heavy reduction at cold rolling of a strip. The castings were in the flat form in dimension of 4, 5 x 50 x 50 mm, than cold rolled to 1, 5 mm, intermediate annealed and finally cold rolled to thickness of 0, 5 mm with height reduction of 66, 7 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between alloying content, microstructure and properties {{has been studied}} for high strength steel weld metals with 7 to 9 wt. % nickel. Neural network modelling suggested that manganese reductions lead to large impact toughness increases and that nickel must be added {{in a controlled manner}} with respect to manganese in order toincrease impact toughness. Carbon additions were predicted to enhance yield strength at limited loss to impact toughness. Following these predictions, shielded metal arc welding was used to produce experimental welds with manganese at 0. 5 or 2 wt. %, nickel at 7 or 9 wt. % while carbon was varied between 0. 03 and 0. 11 wt. %. Based on Themo-Calc calculations and the observed segregation behaviour, it was concluded that the weld metals solidified completely as austenite. With high resolution microscopy the microstructure was found to be a mixture of predominantly upper bainite and a coarse grained, previously not documented, constituent characterised to be coalesced bainite in dendrite core regions, with mainly martensite present in interdendritic regions for high manganese weld metals. Manganese reductions were found to promote upper bainite while carbon additions were found to promote martensite. A <b>constitutional</b> <b>diagram</b> was constructed that summarises microstructure as a function of manganese and nickel contents. In Part B o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{most widely}} {{excavated}} iron artifacts used as weapons or farm tools from central southern regions of Korea were subjects of non-metallic inclusion analysis through metallographic examination, microhardness measurement, and {{scanning electron microscopy}} with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Through metallographic inter-pretation and study of the analyzed results, the steel manufacturing and iron smelting using heat processing in the iron artifacts excavated from the central southern region of the ancient Korean peninsula was studied, and {{the analysis of the}} non-metallic inclusions mixed within the metal-lic structures was interpreted as the ternary phase diagram of the oxide to infer the type of iron ores for the iron products and the temperature of the furnace used to smelt them. Most of the ancient forged iron arti-facts showed Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 with high SiO 2 contents and relatively low Al 2 O 3 contents for iron ore, indicating t hat for Al 2 O 3 below 5 %, it is presumed that magnetic iron ores were reduced to bloom iron (sponge iron) with direct-reduction process for production. The temperature for extraction of wustite for Al 2 O 3 below 1 % was found to be 1, 020 ∼ 1, 05 0 ℃. Considering the oxide ternary <b>constitutional</b> <b>diagram</b> of glassy in-clusions, the steel-manufacturing temperature was presumed to have been near 1, 150 ∼ 1, 280 ℃ in most cases, and minimum melting tem-perature of casting iron part excavated in Daeseong-ri. Gyeonggi was near 1, 400 ℃, and it is thought that hypoeutectic cast iron of about 2. 3 % carbon was casted and fragility of cast iron was improved by de-carburizing in solid state...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{variations}} in alloying content on the microstructure and mechanical properties of {{high strength steel}} weld metals have been studied. Based on neural network modelling, weld metals were produced using shielded metal arc welding with nickel at 7 or 9 wt. %, manganese at 2 or 0. 5 wt. % while carbon was varied between 0. 03 and 0. 11 wt. %. From mechanical testing, {{it was confirmed that}} a large gain in impact toughness could be achieved by reducing the manganese content. Carbon additions were found to increase strength with only a minor loss to impact toughness as predicted by the modelling. The highest yield strength (912 MPa) in combination with good impact toughness (over 60 J at – 100 oC) was achieved with an alloying content of 7 wt. % nickel, 0. 5 wt. % manganese and 0. 11 wt. % carbon. Based on thermodynamic calculations and observed segregation behaviour it was concluded that the weld metals solidify as austenite. The microstructure was characterised using optical, transmission electron and high resolution scanning electron microscopy. At interdendritic regions mainly martensite was found. In dendrite core regions of the low carbon weld metals a mixture of upper bainite, lower bainite and a novel constituent—coalesced bainite—formed. Coalesced bainite was characterised by large bainitic ferrite grains with cementite precipitates and is believed to form when the bainite and martensite start temperatures are close to each other. Carbon additions were found to promote a more martensitic microstructure throughout the dendrites. Mechanical properties could be rationalised in terms of microstructural constituents and a <b>constitutional</b> <b>diagram</b> was constructed summarising microstructure as a function of manganese and nickel contents...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade CdхZn 1 -хTe (CZT) solid {{solutions}} became an important material in manufacturing of detectors of radioactive radiation. These solutions can gradually change the physical properties with change of their structure. In comparison with CdTe they are more radiation-resistant [...] However {{there is a problem}} of obtaining of such a homogeneous materials with resistivity of cmOm ⋅ 810 and above at room temperature. Because of the complexity of <b>constitutional</b> <b>diagram.</b> It is practically impossible to grow CdхZn 1 -хTe in the evacuated quartz ampoules by Bridgman method. We have elaborated a sublimation method for obtaining CdхZn 1 -хTe crystals. This method allows growing these homogeneous in composition compounds by passing liquid phase. CdхZn 1 -хTe as well as CdTe is characterized by the deficiency among which such defects as are Cd(Zn). Te vacancies a complex formation []−− − D,V Zn,Cd, [] 02 D,V Zn,Cd− − – type with a concentration reaches of 31610 −cm. That is why high resistance of CdхZn 1 -хTe crystals is reached by mears of the doping with elements from group VII a III of Mendeleyev table during the growing process. It occurs due to the compensation of the acceptor centers which are represented by the vacancies and formations on their basis. However, this does not solve a problem, as the lifetime of the charge carriers and their mobility decreases in compensated crystals. There exists another method of influence on electric activity of defects a impurities in a crystal. It is the method of passivation them by introduction of atomic hydrogen in a crystal. Passivation of both donor a acceptor centers is mostly investigated in GaAs and Si [1, 2]. The possibility of defect passivation also in CdTe is shown in [3, 4]. Not introducing new defects, by passivation of already existent in a crystal defects, it is possible to increase such important parameters as mobility a life time of the charge carriers [5]. That is why, we have investigated the effect of defect passivation in CdхZn 1 -хTe crystals...|$|E
