40|$|A {{numerical}} simulation {{of the flow}} in a carbon dioxide filter is shown in this paper. The filter {{is used in the}} urea production plant and it is connected to the suction of a compressor. The filter housing has a Tee shaped duct and an internal cartridge with a cylindrical shape. The Tee shape allows the <b>cartridge’s</b> <b>assembly.</b> The external diameter of the duct is bigger than the cartridge reducing the stream area to ensure a good filtration. To simplify the manufacturing process, the first design of the cartridge has 9 mm diameter holes distributed in circular and longitudinal pattern. It has 14 mm and 8 mm center distance in longitudinal side and circular side. The filter has an inlet diameter of 20 ” and a divergent outlet of 24 ”. The aim of this study is the analysis and optimization of the filter geometry in terms of total pressure between its inlet and outlet side. Moreover an optimization of the basket’s holes distribution was done. First of all the 2 D model of a first filter geometry was compared with a 3 D model. The comparison showed a good agreement of results. Then the outlet diameter, the inlet angle and the holes arrangement have been studied with a bi-dimensional CFD modeling approach. The final goal of the whole activity was to introduce a methodology to optimize a very complex geometry by using a simplified bi-dimensional model with low computational costs...|$|R
50|$|The {{disposable}} head philosophy uses a {{print head}} which is supplied {{as a part}} of a replaceable ink cartridge. Every time a cartridge is exhausted, the entire cartridge and print head are replaced with a new one. This adds to the cost of consumables and makes it more difficult to manufacture a high-precision head at a reasonable cost, but also means that a damaged or clogged print head is only a minor problem: the user can simply buy a new cartridge. Hewlett-Packard has traditionally favoured the disposable print head, as did Canon in its early models. This type of construction can also be seen as an effort by printer manufacturers to stem third party ink <b>cartridge</b> <b>assembly</b> replacements, as these would-be suppliers don't have the ability to manufacture specialized print heads.|$|E

A Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) is being developed for preliminary parachute drop tests at the Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) to simulate high-speed reentry to Earth from beyond Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) and to provide measurements of landing parameters and parachute loads. The avionics systems on CPAS also provide mission critical firing events to deploy, reef, and release the parachutes in three stages (extraction, drogues, mains) using mortars and pressure <b>cartridge</b> <b>assemblies.</b> In addition, a Mid-Air Delivery System (MDS) is used to separate the capsule from the sled {{that is used to}} eject the capsule {{from the back of the}} drop plane.

Providing high purity, 100 % dense standards of pure elements and compounds can be fabricated, the composition of solid solution alloys can be determined by measuring the CT number, which is a function of the absorption of the sample. Average densities across slices 1 mm thick can generally be determined to better than 1 percent. With present technology this spatial sensitivity is less than ideal, but important benefits can nevertheless be obtained by using CT, particularly single crystals, prior to making any destructive assault upon the sample.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of a pyroshock environment on the performance characteristics of a propellant used in pyrotechnic devices such as guillotine cutters. Near field pyroshock which is defined by acceleration amplitudes in excess of 10, 000 g at a frequency of greater than 10, 000 Hz is a highly transient environment that has a known potential to cause failure in both structural and electronic components.

This data will be compared to the base-lined ambient closed bomb data to evaluate the effects of the shock on the performance of the propellant. It is expected that the pyroshock environment will cause brittle failures of the propellant increasing the surface area of said propellant. This increase of surface area should result in increased combustion rate which should show as an increased pressure peak and decreased time to peak pressure in the pressure time data...|$|E
40|$|Under a NASA-ESA {{collaborative}} research project, three Al- 7 -weight-percentage Si samples (MICAST- 6, MICAST- 7 and MICAST 2 - 12) were directionally solidified aboard the International Space Station {{to determine the}} effect of mitigating convection on the primary dendrite array. The samples were approximately 25 centimeters in length with a diameter of 7. 8 millimeter-diameter cylinders that were machined from [100] oriented terrestrially grown dendritic Al- 7 Si samples and inserted into alumina ampoules within the Sample <b>Cartridge</b> <b>Assembly</b> (SCA) inserts of the Low Gradient Furnace (LGF). The feed rods were partially remelted in space and directionally solidified to effect the [100] dendrite-orientation. MICAST- 6 was grown at 5 microns per second for 3. 75 centimeters and then at 50 microns per second for its remaining 11. 2 centimeters of its length. MICAST- 7 was grown at 20 microns per second for 8. 5 centimeters and then at 10 microns per second for 9 centimeters of its remaining length. MICAST 2 - 12 was grown at 40 microns per second for 11 centimeters. The thermal gradient at the liquidus temperature varied from 22 to 14 degrees Kelvin per centimeter during growth of MICAST- 6, from 26 to 24 degrees Kelvin per centimeter for MICAST- 7 and from 33 to 31 degrees Kelvin per centimeter for MICAST 2 - 12. Microstructures on the transverse sections along the sample length were analyzed to determine nearest-neighbor spacing of the primary dendrite arms and trunk diameters of the primary dendrite-arrays. This was done along the lengths where steady-state growth prevailed and also during the transients associated with the speed-changes. The observed nearest-neighbor spacings during steady-state growth of the MICAST samples show a very good agreement with predictions from the Hunt-Lu primary spacing model for diffusion controlled growth. The observed primary dendrite trunk diameters during steady-state growth of these samples also agree with predictions from a coarsening-based model. The radial macrosegregation and "steepling" caused by thermosolutal convection during terrestrial growth of the Al- 7 Si was not observed in the space-grown MICAST samples...|$|E
40|$|Ground-based heat {{treatment}} tests are planned on an argon gas-filled tantalum cartridge developed as pan of a Diffusion Processes in Molten Semiconductors (DPIMS) experiment conducted on NASA's Space Shuttle. The {{possibility that the}} cartridge may creep during testing and touch the furnace walls is of real concern in this program. The present paper discusses the results of calculations performed to evaluate this possibility. Deformation mechanism maps were constructed using literature data {{in order to identify}} the creep mechanism dominant under the appropriate stresses and temperatures corresponding to the test conditions. These results showed that power-law creep was dominant when the grain size of the material exceeded 55 gm but Coble creep was the important mechanism below this value of grain size. Finite element analysis was used to analyze the {{heat treatment}} tWs assuming a furnace run away condition (which is a worst case scenario) using the appropriate creep parameters corresponding to grain sizes of 1 and 100 gm. Calculations were also conducted to simulate the effect of an initial 3 tilt of the <b>cartridge</b> <b>assembly,</b> the maximum possible tilt angle. The von Mises stress and su-ain distributions were calculated assuming that the cartridge was fixed at one end as it was heated from ambient temperature to 1823 K in 1. 42 h, maintained at 1823 K for 9. 5 h and then further heated to an over temperature condition of 2028 K in 0. 3 h. The inelastic axial and radial displacements of the cartridge walls were evaluated by resolving the von Mises strain along the corresponding directions. These calculations reveal that the maximum axial and radial displacements are expected to be about 2. 9 and 0. 25 mm, respectively, for both fine and coarse-grained materials at 2028 K. It was determined that these displacements occur during heat-up to temperature and creep of the cartridge is likely to be relatively insignificant irrespective of grain size. Furthermore, with a 3 ' tilt of the cartridge, the deflection is increased by only 0. 39 gm which is negligible. Since the gap between the furnace heating elements and the cartridge is about 7. 5 mm and less than the maximum radial dilation of 0. 25 mm at 2028 K, it is concluded that the cartridge is unlikely to touch the furnace walls during the experiments...|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{material}} science gained in microgravity research requires processing a sample in a high performance furnace. One such furnace currently being designed is the Quench Module Insert (QMI). The Principle Investigators, for whom the furnace is proposed, require high temperature gradients in their cylindrical samples to achieve the science objectives. One of the components critical to achieving high sample axial temperature gradients in the Quench Module Insert is a high performance cold zone to extract {{the heat from the}} sample. This cold zone employs a compliant, sliding thermal interface based on a Vel-Therm felt. This felt provides a conductive path between the Sample <b>Cartridge</b> <b>Assembly</b> (SCA) exterior surface and the interior surface of the water cooled chill block while allowing movement of the sample relative to the chill block. The Vel-Therm felt is composed of long polymer-based fibers affixed to a thin flexible substrate layer. The fibers are oriented perpendicular to this substrate giving the felt the appearance of a velvet fabric. The Vel-Therm felt heat extraction capability was quantified in earlier tests performed in an inert gas environment. The current activity, described in this paper, is intended to characterize the extraction capability of Vel-Therm felt in a vacuum environment similar to the QMI environment. This testing is necessary to quantify the thermal performance of the Vel-Therm felt and the sensitivity of that performance to key variables. The data derived from these tests will be incorporated into the current thermal models {{to improve the quality of}} the models and reduce uncertainty of the analytical results. In addition, the data will be used to help select the appropriate Vel-Therm felt and set proper operating limits as well as assess the performance range of the furnace. The objective of this test is to measure the heat extraction rate of the Vel-Therm felt as specified by the effective heat transfer coefficient. Therefore, the test setup was designed to force the bulk of the heat transfer through the area where the Vel-Therm felt was applied. A heat source, consisting of a ceramic heating element encased in a Copper (Cu) housing is mounted on four isolated support rods. A 6 -layer molybdenum radiation shield is used to insulate against heat loss from the heater and prevent heat exchange between the hot and cold sides of the test apparatus. The Vel-Therm felt is affixed to the surface of the cold sink, a water-cooled Cu chill block. An adjustable plate supports and isolates the cold sink from above and is used to control the amount of the deflection of the Vel- Therm when in contact with the Cu heating element housing. The primary means of establishing the power being conducted through the felt is to measure the energy being transferred to the water passing through the chill block. Analysis was performed to support the assumption that the source and sink surfaces were approximately isothermal under the specific test conditions. As a check on the amount of power passing through the felt, the power supplied to the heater was also measured. Thermocouples were strategically located throughout the test apparatus for measurement purposes. A bell jar was lowered over the assembly to impose vacuum conditions. Currently, variables tested have been fiber compression and fiber type and surface temperatures (both the hot and cold side temperatures are hypothesized to be important to the performance of the Vel-Therm.) Selected runs were repeated to ensure consistency and repeatability. Results obtained thus far reveal that Vel-Therm performance is significantly degraded by fibers being exposed to high compression. It also shows that performance is somewhat negatively impacted by previous compression, thereby, raising the question of repeatability. In addition, early results show a significant dependence on temperature. A computer aided mathematical analysis of the test setup is ongoing. The results will be correlated to actual results. The correlation will examine such details as parasitic loses, conduction down the power leads and many other concerns...|$|E
