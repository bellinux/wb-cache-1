40|$|The current {{research}} in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is showing the potential that the Information Technologies can have in music related applications. A major research challenge {{in that direction}} is how to automatically describe/annotate audio recordings {{and how to use}} the resulting descriptions to discover and appreciate music in new ways. But music is a complex phenomenon and the description of an audio recording has to deal with this complexity. For example, each music culture has specificities and emphasizes different musical and communication aspects, thus the musical recordings of each culture should be described differently. At the same time these <b>cultural</b> <b>specificities</b> give us the opportunity to pay attention to musical concepts and facets that, despite being present in most world musics, are not easily noticed by listeners.

5000|$|A {{different}} {{interpretation of}} [...] "universalization" [...] {{has been proposed}} by Gregory Paul Meyjes.

At the global level, Meyjes thus proposes universalization to denote a process of (largely) non-imposed socio-cultural exchange between state-level and sub-state-level groups and [...] "nations" [...] - i.e. a transnational process that informs the gradual emergence of a universal civilization.|$|E

5000|$|Debate {{concerning}} international co-productions centres on {{the potential}} for productions to have little <b>cultural</b> <b>specificity</b> in any of its home countries.

In Australia, for example, O'Regan and Ward have argued that an influx of international productions to Queensland's Gold Coast in the 1990s presented a distinct challenge to local producers. In {{the face of such}} challenges, local producers need to learn [...] "how to internationalise local film and television production in order to retain and hopefully build market shares; and how to develop new models of financing that combine both local and foreign sources." [...] One approach has been to reconcile this tension by creating [...] "local production with an explicit international orientation." [...] But not everyone agrees this is the best approach. For example, the idea that Australia should produce more 'deterritorialised' programming such as fantasy and science fiction has been met with disquiet in some sections of the industry.|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to notice that, despite the widespread dissemination of relationship education program around the world, when the present study began, there were not any records of others initiatives on relationship education in Brazil. As far as we known, the “Living as Partners” program is the pioneer scientific relationship education program in Brazil, addressing an unexplored field of research and intervention focused on Brazilian <b>cultural</b> <b>specificities.</b> The decision {{to develop a new}} program, instead of translate and adapt existing international programs, was made based on two major points. First, we had a funding research that demanded the development of an applied technology {{as a result of the}} investigation developed. Second, we wanted to address the <b>cultural</b> <b>specificities</b> of South Brazilian culture and demands, once the results of the previous research had evidenced some points that were not addressed by existing relationship education programs but are important to our local context. These points are largely employed myths regarding marital conflict and communication, the awareness of couples to their own history, and couple’s leisure, which was the most frequent reason for marital disagreement of the 750 couples on the research sample that preceded the development of the program. Even so, the core competencies addressed by the “Living as Partners” program are related to couples conflicts, given its importance to marital quality as attested by the national and international literature.|$|R
