40|$|This paper {{analyses}} what post 2020 targets may {{be necessary}} for the European CO 2 legislation for <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> {{in order to reach}} the overall sectoral goal of 60 % reduction of transport's greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 relative to 1990, as defined in the European Commission's White Paper. The required target levels are found to depend strongly on the contribution that <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> need to make to reaching the overall target, on the assumed growth of <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> <b>mobility,</b> and {{on the extent to which}} biofuels could be available for fuelling <b>passenger</b> <b>cars.</b> To what extent electric vehicles and other low emission vehicles such as plug-in hybrids and fuel cell electric vehicles are needed to meet the post- 2020 targets depends on the target level and on the minimum CO 2 emissions that can be reached in conventional vehicles. Almost all assessed scenarios, require significant amounts of low emission vehicles to be sold from 2030 or 2035 onwards. Electric and plug-in vehicles are in the early stage of market introduction now, but developments are fragile could end up in a 'valley of death'. Defining a sufficiently low <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> CO 2 target for 2025 may be an effective instrument to motivate manufacturers to continue their efforts in the marketing and further development of these vehicles. This is important for maintaining the momentum of the transition towards large-scale application of low CO 2 emitting vehicles...|$|R
40|$|While <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> <b>mobility</b> {{and related}} tail-pipe {{emissions}} within urban areas have received considerable attention, {{very little is}} known about the contribution of commercial vehicles to mobile source emissions. More specifically, it is desirable to investigate not only the total volume of emissions, but also emissions by link in the transportation network. In this paper a methodology is discussed that enables the estimation of commercial truck emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) or simply hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM) at the aggregate and link levels. This methodology has been applied to the Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. A truck origin-destination (O-D) matrix was supplied by the City of Hamilton. The concept of <b>Passenger</b> <b>Car</b> Equivalence (PCE) was used to transform this matrix into a <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> O-D matrix. The integrated land-use and transport model IMULATE has been modified to incorporate the transformed commercial vehicle matrix, along with the matrix of <b>passenger</b> <b>cars.</b> The relative contribution of trucks to mobile source emissions during the morning peak period can be shown at the link level, or aggregated to the regional level (Table 1. 0). A PCE value of zero implies the total absence of trucks in the network. Reported emission values in this case are attributed to <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> alone. PCE values greater than zero indicate the number of vehicles displaced in traffic flow by the presence of a single truck. Reported emissions under such conditions are affected by the presence of trucks. Table 1. 0 : Aggregate emissions and trips made for varying PCE value...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} the effect of exchanging <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> <b>mobility</b> for bicycle mobility on the number of fatalities and serious road injuries in the Netherlands. A precise calculation of this effect is not possible {{due to a lack of}} information, but we were able to give a first and rough approximation of the safety effect. The analysis considers a substitution of 10 % of car trips shorter than 7. 5 km by bicycle trips. The analysis is done ceteris paribus, thus, all relevant parameters are assumed to remain equal (except of course mobility). Assuming that the increase in bicycle trips is distributed equally over the network, time of day etc., as current bicycle mobility is, the increase in the number of fatalities and serious road injuries in crashes involving bicycles can be estimated. In the same way, the decrease in the number of fatalities and serious road injuries in crashes involving cars is estimated, assuming that the mobility decrease has the same safety properties as the remaining car mobility...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{transport}} mode <b>car</b> <b>passenger</b> {{accounts for a}} substantial share of the modal split. Travel demand models, however, often contain only a simplistic representation of this mode. Modeling <b>car</b> <b>passenger</b> trips realistically is complex, since the availability of this mode option depends {{on the presence of}} a car driver. Indeed an agent-based travel demand model is a solid foundation for a more realistic implementation of the <b>car</b> <b>passenger</b> mode. The paper describes the former implementation of the <b>car</b> <b>passenger</b> mode in the agent-based travel demand model mobiTopp and the weaknesses of this approach. It discusses different situations where <b>car</b> <b>passenger</b> trips occur, namely joint activities and ridesharing, and outlines a simple but flexible concept for the implementation of ridesharing. It describes the changes to mobiTopp that where necessary to implement the ridesharing concept and the experiences made with this new <b>car</b> <b>passenger</b> model...|$|R

40|$|Background: The risk {{of serious}} {{injury or death}} {{has been found to}} be reduced for some front {{compared}} to rear seat <b>car</b> <b>passengers</b> in newer vehicles. However, differences in injury severity between car occupants by seating position has not been examined. This study examines the injury severity risk for rear compared to front seat <b>car</b> <b>passengers.</b> Method: A retrospective matched-cohort analysis was conducted of vehicle crashes involving injured rear vs front seat <b>car</b> <b>passengers</b> identified in linked police-reported, hospitalisation and emergency department (ED) presentation records during 2001 - 2011 in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Odds ratios were estimated using an ordinal logistic mixed model and logistic mixed models. Results There were 5419 front and 4588 rear seat passengers in 3681 vehicles. There was a higher odds of sustaining a higher injury severity as a rear-compared to a front seat <b>car</b> <b>passenger,</b> with a higher odds of rear seat passengers sustaining serious injuries compared to minimal injuries. Where the vehicle occupant was older, travelling in a vehicle manufactured between 1990 and 1996 or after 1997, where the airbag deployed, and where the vehicle was driven where the speed limit was ≥ 70 km/h there was a higher odds of the rear passenger sustaining a higher injury severity then a front seated occupant. Conclusion: Rear seat <b>car</b> <b>passengers</b> are sustaining injuries of a higher severity compared to front seat passengers travelling in the same vehicle, as well as when travelling in newer vehicles and where the front seat occupant is shielded by an airbag deployed in the crash. Rear seat occupant protective mechanisms should be examined. Pre-hospital trauma management policies could influence whether an individual is transported to a hospital ED, thus it would be beneficial to have an objective measure of injury severity routinely available in ED records. Further examination of injury severity between rear and front seat passengers is warranted to examine less severe non-fatal injuries by car seating position and vehicle intrusion. 9 page(s...|$|R
