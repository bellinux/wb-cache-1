5|$|Vitus Bering {{had been}} a {{prominent}} sailor in Russia. After successful expeditions in 1725, 1728, and 1730, Bering was sent to explore {{what is now the}} Bering Sea area of the Pacific in 1740. He soon settled on Kamchatka, where he started a settlement and built two additional vessels, dubbed St. Peter and St. Paul. In 1741 Bering and his company started towards North America, but were stalled by a storm and in being delayed were forced to take land. During the storm they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the Alaskan coast. The storm proved too powerful so the ships turned around, along the way charting several of the Aleutians, including Gareloi. Since then, it has been barely studied, resulting in a fragmentary knowledge of its eruptions and possibly even unrecorded episodes.|$|E
5|$|Lion was hit twice more, {{during what}} came to be called the 'Run to the North', after the German battlecruisers made their own turn north. Beatty's ships {{maintained}} full speed to try to put some separation between them and the High Seas Fleet and gradually moved out of range. They turned north and then northeast to try to rendezvous with {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet. At 5:40pm they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers. The setting sun blinded the German gunners, and they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 5:47. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east, further away from the Germans. By 6:35 Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn, and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. At 6:44 Beatty turned his ships southeast and to the south-southeast four minutes later searching for Hipper's ships. Beatty took this opportunity to recall the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of New Zealand and then slowed down to eighteen knots and altered course to the south to prevent himself from getting separated from the Grand Fleet. At this moment Lions gyrocompass failed, and she made a complete circle before her steering was brought under control again. At 6:55 Scheer ordered another 180° turn, which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet, which had altered course itself to the south. This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer's T, and they badly damaged his leading ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 7:13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap into which he had sent them.|$|E
500|$|Abdulredha Buhmaid {{was among}} the protesters. He was shot by {{a bullet in the}} head, {{collapsed}} to the ground and {{in the words of a}} witness, [...] "blood was rushing from his head". Others sustained severe injuries inflicted by gunshots, two of whom also fell to the ground. Several eyewitnesses said army troops [...] "gave no warning", but one witness said he heard them issue a warning several minutes after the initial shooting. Another witness said they heard a [...] "faint voice of someone over a loudspeaker in the distance but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> what the speaker was saying".|$|E

60|$|There was {{something}} so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr. Wopsle's eye, {{and he seemed}} to be turning so many things over in his mind and to grow so confused, that I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> it <b>out.</b> I sat thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large watch-case, and still I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> it <b>out.</b> I was still thinking of it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him waiting for me near the door.|$|R
500|$|Later in {{the evening}} of {{the first day of the}} battle, the hard-pressed battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group were being pursued by their British opponents. Pommern and the other {{so-called}} [...] "five-minute ships" [...] came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. Pommern <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> a target in the darkness, though several of her sisters could. Despite this, their shooting was ineffective. The British battlecruisers scored several hits on the German ships, including one on Pommern by a [...] shell fired by , forcing her to haul out of line. Admiral Mauve ordered an 8-point turn to the south to disengage from the British, and they did not follow.|$|E

This led Sir Vere Hunt to seek someone who would take the island off his hands, failing {{in his attempt to}} sell the island to the British Government as a base for troops. [...] After the 1st Baronet's death his son, Sir Aubrey (Hunt) de Vere, 2nd Baronet, also had great difficulty in securing any profit from the property. In the 1820s John Benison agreed to purchase the island for £4,500 but then refused to complete sale as he felt that the 2nd Baronet <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> a good title in respect of the sale terms, namely that the island was free from tithes and taxes.|$|E
500|$|Later on {{the first}} day of the battle, Hipper's badly damaged battlecruisers were being engaged by their British rivals. Schleswig-Holstein and the other {{so-called}} [...] "five-minute ships" [...] came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. These ships were very briefly engaged, owing in large part to the poor visibility. The visibility was so bad, the gunners aboard Schleswig-Holstein <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> a target, and she did not fire her main guns. At 21:35 a heavy caliber shell struck the ship on the port-side, punching a hole approximately 40cm (16in) wide before exploding against the inner casemate armor. It tore apart [...] of the superstructure deck and disabled one of the port side casemate guns. Three men were killed and nine were wounded. Admiral Mauve halted the fight against the much more powerful battlecruisers and ordered an 8-point turn to starboard.|$|E

500|$|Late on the 31st, {{the fleet}} {{organized}} {{for the night}} march back to Germany; Deutschland, Pommern, and Hannover fell in behind [...] and the other dreadnoughts of the III Battle Squadron towards {{the rear of the}} line. British destroyers conducted a series of attacks against the fleet, some of which targeted Deutschland. In the melee, Deutschland and König turned away from the attacking destroyers, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> targets clearly enough to engage them effectively, Deutschland firing only a few 8.8cm shells in the mist without effect. Soon after, Pommern exploded after she was struck by at least one torpedo. Fragments of the ship rained down around Deutschland. Regardless, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached Horns Reef by 4:00 on 1 June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where the undamaged dreadnoughts of the Nassau and es took up defensive positions. In the course of the battle, Deutschland had expended only a single 28cm shell and five 8.8cm rounds. She had not been damaged in the engagement.|$|E
500|$|New Zealand was [...] {{several times}} by the {{battleship}} [...] but was not hit. Beatty's ships maintained full speed {{in an attempt to}} increase the distance between them and the High Seas Fleet, and gradually moved out of range. They turned north and then north-east to try to rendezvous with {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet. At 5:40, they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers. The setting sun blinded the German gunners, and as they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the British ships, they turned away to the north-east at 5:47. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet in battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east, further away from the Germans. By 6:35, Beatty was following Indomitable and [...] of the 3rd BCS as they were steering east-south-east, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their south-west. A few minutes earlier, Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn and Beatty lost sight of the High Seas Fleet in the haze. Twenty minutes later, Scheer ordered another 180° turn which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet, which had altered course to the south. This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer's T, forming a battle line that cut across his battle line and badly damaging his leading ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 7:13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap into which he had sent them.|$|E
500|$|New Zealand {{was engaged}} by the {{battleship}} [...] beginning at 5:08 during {{what came to}} be called the 'Run to the North', but she was not hit, although she was straddled several times.
