5|$|The press {{themselves}} came in {{for some}} criticism in this respect, with the group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> the Times and other media outlets focused {{on the effect of}} Nannygate on white, upper-middle-class women, and excluded the perspective of the actual immigrant childcare workers.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 they {{reported}} Charles Saatchi to the UK Office of Fair Trading, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> {{he had an}} effective monopoly on art. The complaint was not upheld. In 2003, an allied group, Stuckism Photography, was founded by Larry Dunstan and Andy Bullock. In 2005 the Stuckists offered a donation of 175 paintings from the Walker show to the Tate, but it {{was rejected by the}} Tate's trustees.|$|E
5|$|Youthfulness : Horace emphasises Troilus' youth {{by calling}} him inpubes ("unhairy", i.e. pre-pubescent or, figuratively, {{not old enough}} to bear arms). Dio Chrysostom derides Achilles in his Trojan discourse, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> all that the {{supposed}} hero achieved before Homer was the capture of Troilus who was still a boy.|$|E
50|$|Ike Turner <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> Fishburne's {{portrayal}} {{of him was}} inaccurate.|$|R
60|$|Consolation, Cicero <b>complains</b> <b>that</b> {{nothing is}} of use, ii., 160.|$|R
50|$|Copts <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> {{disputes}} between Christians and Muslims are often put before “reconciliation councils”, {{and that these}} councils invariably favour Muslims. Some Copts <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> the police do not respond when crimes are committed against them. Copts also have little representation in government, leading them to fear there is little hope of progress.|$|R
5|$|After leaving office, Talbot {{continued}} in public service, {{serving on the}} Health Committee of the Massachusetts State Board of Health, Lunacy, and Charity from 1880–84, holding {{the chair of the}} committee in 1880-82. As governor, Talbot had overseen the merger of the Board of Health, with the Board of Lunacy and Charity. Although this merger had been done ostensibly as a cost-saving measure, health care activists opposed it. Henry Ingersoll Bowditch, in particular, resigned from the merged board, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> it was dominated by business owners seeking to minimize discussion of pollution caused by their businesses.|$|E
5|$|He was an Australian {{selector}} from 1967 to 1979. Immediately {{after his}} appointment, he was embroiled in controversy during the First Test against India at Brisbane in 1967–68. The Queensland Cricket Association {{wrote to the}} board, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> Harvey, who was the selector on duty at the Test, had missed two hours of play. He had been at a race meeting {{at the invitation of}} the QCA president. The ACB gave Harvey a talking to. Despite this, he retained his position at the next annual election, with Queensland's Ken Mackay failing to gain a seat on the selection panel.|$|E
5|$|Lucas voiced displeasure in the puppet's {{appearance}} and immobility, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> the puppet {{had to be}} moved around the set to film different scenes. In the DVD commentary to the Special Edition of Return of the Jedi, Lucas notes that if the technology had been available in 1983, Jabba the Hutt {{would have been a}} CGI character similar to the one that appears in the Special Edition scene of A New Hope.|$|E
50|$|Though he {{remained}} {{a supporter of}} TVA, Neal constantly criticized the agency throughout the 1930s. He <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> its wages were too low, accused it of favoritism toward large industries, and <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> it was too slow in buying out independent power companies. After TVA had bought out most independent power companies, Neal <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> {{the loss of the}} companies hurt Tennessee counties which had relied on their tax dollars. When TVA forced Neal to sell his Rhea Springs property during the Watts Bar project (when the entire community was inundated), Neal sued, and was eventually paid $55,000 for the land.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Rachel (Lea Michele) {{realizes that}} some glee club members are faking their singing. She tells glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> {{she is doing}} most of the work, exhausting herself and getting ill in the process. She reveals the non-participants as Finn (Cory Monteith), Quinn (Dianna Agron), Puck, Brittany (Heather Morris), and Santana. Will gathers the students and gives them a new task for the week: each club member will have to do solos, and each must choose a song that best represents their feelings.|$|E
5|$|The games {{received}} critical acclaim, obtaining {{an aggregate}} score of 81percent on Metacritic. Most critics praised {{the fact that}} the games introduced new features while still maintaining the traditional gameplay of the series. Reception of the graphics and audio was more mixed, with some reviewers <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> they were too simplistic and not much of an improvement over the previous games, Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. FireRed and LeafGreen were commercial successes, selling a total of around 12million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Though the M32 {{has a small}} traffic flow, {{it is one of}} {{the most}} {{congested}} motorways in the region as it connects a number of key areas. As well as providing one of the few high-quality routes into the centre of Bristol, it is the only significant link from the M4 to the A4174 Bristol Ring Road. Parts of the M32 are reaching the end of their intended lifespan, leading to reduced speed limits and occasional closures for remedial work. Local residents have criticised the M32, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> it has severed communities and has an unacceptable noise level.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the game}} was never completed, {{only a small portion}} of the {{intended}} gameplay exists. During the playable segment, Mustafa, through conversations with other detainees, discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a pair of pliers to make the attempt. Mustafa must join a work detail to gain access to the pliers, hide the pliers in a garbage can to prevent them from being found during a search, recover them at night (which requires Mustafa to find a way to pry open the area that the garbage cans are stored in), and deliver them to the other detainee. The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers. Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who, after <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> a guard threw her copy of the Quran to the ground, mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from a previous escape attempt.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the PTC {{launched}} a campaign against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> their SmackDown! program contained levels of sexuality and violence unbecoming prime time programming. In the campaign, Bozell said that four children {{had been killed by}} peers emulating professional wrestling moves learned from the program. With these allegations, Bozell and various PTC members began meeting with representatives of the advertising departments of various companies that advertised on SmackDown! to persuade them to withdraw sponsorship. The PTC also suggested that between 30 and 40 advertisers had pulled their commercials from WWF programming, an assertion that was not true.|$|E
5|$|Sales were satisfactory, and the {{development}} of sequels began almost immediately after The Witcher release. The team began the design work for The Witcher 2 , and experimented with consoles to develop a new engine for The Witcher 3. Their development was halted when the team began work on , a console version of The Witcher. Although they collaborated with French studio Widescreen Games for the console port, it entered development limbo. Widescreen demanded more manpower, money and time to develop the title, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> they were not being paid; according to Iwiński, CD Projekt paid them more than their own staff members. The team cancelled the project, suspending its development. Unhappy with the decision, Atari demanded that CD Projekt repay them for funding the console port development and Iwiński agreed that Atari would be the North American publisher of the sequel of The Witcher 2. CD Projekt acquired Metropolis Software in 2008.|$|E

5|$|The Liberals and PC party {{differed}} considerably on {{fiscal and}} tax policies. In his opening campaign speech at Massey Hall in Toronto, Diefenbaker contended that Canadians were overtaxed {{in the amount}} of $120 per family of four. Diefenbaker pledged to reduce taxes and castigated the Liberals for not reducing taxes despite the government surplus. St. Laurent also addressed tax policy in his opening speech, in Winnipeg. St. Laurent noted that since 1953, tax rates had declined, as had the national debt, and that Canada had a reputation as a good place for investments. The Prime Minister argued that the cost of campaign promises made by the Progressive Conservatives would inevitably drive up the tax rate. Diefenbaker also assailed tight-money monetary policies which kept interest rates high, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> they were hitting Atlantic and Western Canada hard.|$|E
5|$|The West Pier was {{constructed}} during {{a boom in}} pleasure pier building in the 1860s, during which 22 new piers were erected across Britain. It was designed by architect Eugenius Birch as a place for seaside visitors to enjoy fresh sea air. Some wealthy residents in the nearby Regency Square objected to construction, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> the planned toll houses at the entrance would spoil {{the view of the}} sea from their homes. It was felt that the pier would {{have a positive effect on}} property values in the town, so the pier was approved. Construction began in 1863 and the pier opened to the public on 6 October 1866.|$|E
5|$|Under the 2008 Charging Order {{introduced}} on 15 November 2008, charges between 10pm and 6am were discontinued, but standard daytime rates increased, {{starting at}} £1.50 for cars. On 7 October 2012 the charges increased to £2 for cars, £2.50 for 2 axle goods vehicles and £5 for multi-axle goods vehicles. By 2012, local businesses were <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> the crossing's charge booths were impeding local growth. The government {{announced that a}} new electronic charging system would be introduced in 2014. Drivers {{would be able to}} pay by phone, text, online or in shops. The charge was proposed to increase to £2.50 for cars, £3 for two-axle goods vehicles and £6 for multi-axle vehicles. A later report stated that drivers evading the charge could be fined as much as £105.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{was also}} criticized. Reviewers called it poor, clumsy, and unsatisfactory, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> Bloodlines favors melee combat; {{firearms}} were weak, unwieldy and slow, even for characters specializing in guns. PC Zone, however, called the first-person shooting entertaining and challenging. Although melee combat was criticized as sluggish and difficult due to enemy attacks interrupting the player's, reviewers considered it overpowered; according to GameSpot, a boss character was killed with melee weapons {{on a first}} attempt after the repeated {{failure to do so}} with a gun. The New York Times found the unavoidable combat in {{the last part of the}} game to be so difficult that they had to cheat to succeed. Stealth was criticized, with IGN noting that even with low stealth skill it was possible to sneak around many enemies and feed from a guard without alerting another guard next to them. GameSpot opined that some of the best missions were stealth-based, as combat was more straightforward.|$|E
5|$|Fluor {{has been}} working on the cleanup and {{shutdown}} of atomic energy plants in Ohio and Washington since the 1990s. In 1992, Fluor won a contract with the United States Energy Department to clean up nuclear waste. By 1996 Hanford was the most contaminated nuclear site in the US and the US Department of Energy was conducting a $50 billion to $60 billion cleanup of the site. Fluor Hanford Inc. replaced Westinghouse Hanford Co. on the project. After a chemical explosion in 1997, 11 workers filed a lawsuit alleging they were denied appropriate medical attention and protective gear. Fluor and the workers disagreed on whether the explosion resulted in any injuries. In 2005 the US Department of Energy fined Fluor for safety violations and that same year a jury awarded $4.7 million in damages to 11 pipe fitters that claimed they were fired after <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> a valve rated for 1,975 pounds-per-inch was being used where 2,235 were needed.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{was present}} during the 1947 Partition of India into the Dominion of Pakistan and the Union of India and the {{accompanying}} ethnic violence between Hindu and Muslim communities. He was unhappy with how these events had affected the Archaeological Survey, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> some of his finest students and staff were now citizens of Pakistan and {{no longer able to}} work for him. He was based in New Delhi when the city was rocked by sectarian violence, and attempted to help many of his Muslim staff members escape from the Hindu-majority city unharmed. He further helped smuggle Muslim families out of the city hospital, where they had taken refuge from a violent Hindu mob. As India neared independence from the British Empire, the political situation had changed significantly; by October 1947 {{he was one of the}} last British individuals in a high-up position within the country's governing establishment, and recognised that many Indian nationalists wanted him to also leave.|$|E
