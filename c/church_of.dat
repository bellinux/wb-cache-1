5000|$|With the {{resignation}} of McKean, some efforts are being made at reconciliation between the International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ and the mainstream <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ. In March 2004, Abilene Christian University held the [...] "Faithful Conversations" [...] dialog between members <b>of</b> the <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ and International <b>Churches</b> <b>of</b> Christ.

5|$|Sale is {{a diverse}} {{community}} with a synagogue and Christian churches of various denominations. The church buildings were mostly constructed in the late 19th or early 20th century {{in the wake of}} the population boom created by the arrival of the railway in 1849, although records show that the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St Martin in Ashton upon Mersey dates back to at least 1304. Before the English Reformation, the inhabitants of Sale were predominantly Catholic, but afterwards were members of the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> England. Roman Catholics returned to the area in the 19th century in the form of Irish immigrants. Two of the three Grade II* listed buildings in the town are churches. The <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St Martin, which was probably originally an early 14th-century timber framed structure, was rebuilt in 1714 after the church had been destroyed in a storm. The <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> St John the Divine was built in 1868, to the design of Alfred Waterhouse.

5|$|The {{original}} church {{within this}} movement, founded in April 1830 in New York by Joseph Smith, was the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> Christ, which was later named the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> the Latter Day Saints.

5|$|After 1935, {{the mines}} were reopened {{and there was}} steady growth in the region. According to David M. Gordon, the unrest gave missionaries {{a chance to respond}} to the Watchtower {{movement}} in a coordinated fashion. The London Missionary Society and the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> Scotland worked together after the strike, saying that the lack of education and religious instruction were contributing factors. The missionaries and the mining companies said that a Christian education would create a disciplined workforce, a belief which was called the spiritual wing of industrial capitalism. The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such as the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> Central Africa in Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> Central Africa in Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> Zambia in 1965).|$|E
