Following Deacon's memories, Sviatoslav was a blue-eyed male of average height but of stalwart build, much more sturdy than Tzimiskes. He shaved his blond head and his beard but wore a bushy mustache and a sidelock {{as a sign of}} his nobility. He preferred to dress in white, and it was noted that his garments were much cleaner than those of his men, although he had a lot in common with his warriors. He wore a single large gold earring bearing a <b>carbuncle</b> and two pearls.|$|E

25|$|Gleason {{was raised}} by his mother. When she died in 1935 of sepsis from a large neck <b>carbuncle</b> (which young Jackie had tried to lance), Gleason was 19, he had nowhere to go, and he had 36 cents to his name. The family of his first girlfriend, Julie Dennehy, offered to take him in; Gleason, however, was headstrong and insisted {{that he was going}} {{into the heart of the}} city. His friend Sammy Birch made room for him in the hotel room he shared with another comedian. Birch also told him of a weeklong gig in Reading, Pennsylvania, that would pay $19, more money than Gleason could imagine. The booking agent {{advanced}} him bus fare for the trip against his salary. This was Gleason's first job as a professional comedian; henceforth, he would always have regular work in small clubs.|$|E
25|$|Twain {{accepted}} {{an offer from}} Robert Sparrow Smythe and embarked on a year-long, around the world lecture tour in July 1895 to pay off his creditors in full, although {{he was no longer}} under any legal obligation to do so. It was a long, arduous journey and he was sick much of the time, mostly from a cold and a <b>carbuncle.</b> The first part of the itinerary took him across northern America to British Columbia, Canada, until the second half of August. For the second part, he sailed across the Pacific Ocean. His scheduled lecture in Honolulu, Hawaii had to be cancelled due to a cholera epidemic. Twain went on to Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, India, Mauritius, and South Africa. His three months in India became the centerpiece of his 712-page book Following the Equator. In the second half of July 1896, he sailed back to England, completing his circumnavigation of the world begun 14 months before.|$|E
25|$|Nofekh (נֹפֶךְ = in the masoretic text) / Anthrax (in the Septuagint) - while Anthrax {{simply means}} coal (presumably here {{referring}} to the colour of burning coal), the Vulgate here has Carbunculus, {{referring to the}} <b>Carbuncle,</b> which was red. Philo of Alexandria, when writing about this stone, says that it was red. He {{seems to be in}} agreement with Josephus, the LXX, and the Jerusalem Targum, the latter saying that it is כדכדנא, explained by Saadia Gaon as meaning karkand, a red variety of precious stone. Nofekh appears to be a loan word; it may derive from the Egyptian term m-f-k-t, referring to Malachite or Turquoise, both of which are a greenish blue; it may instead derive from lupakku, a term appearing in the Amarna letters, referring to a mineral of unknown colour which was sent in tribute to Akhnaten from Ashkalon. In classical rabbinical literature there is some debate between whether Nofekh was red or greenish blue; Exodus Rabbah and the second Jerusalem Targum favour it being red, while the Babylonian Targum and first Jerusalem Targum favour it being green.|$|E

[...] 52 Takes of the Same Thing, Then Boobs was featured in AFI FEST 2010, where Lane Kneedler associate director of programming called it [...] "the most outrageously 'out there' film that we have scheduled". In an interview with Girami, Cottam stated he had intended to direct a feature-length film for some time, and wanted to combine his talents with actors who could improvise in front of the camera. Cottam said he had a great experience working with the actors on the film <b>Carbuncle,</b> and stated he let improvisation be the tool by which the actors could show emotions and create their characters. In September 2010, 52 Takes of the Same Thing, Then Boobs was shown at the Black Rock City Film Festival located at the Burning Man site in the Nevada desert.|$|E

500|$|A free tech demo, Platinum Demo: Final Fantasy XV {{released}} on March 30, 2017. Birthed {{from the initial}} announced wish to develop a second tech demo and forming part of the [...] "Final Fantasy XV Universe", Platinum Demo was created in two months using completed assets from the main game. First announced in January 2016, {{it was designed to}} showcase the game's graphics and physics, along with elements of its final combat system. Set in a dream world after Noctis is gravely wounded as a child, it follows his journey back to consciousness, guided by a creature called <b>Carbuncle</b> that protects Noctis. Players who completed the demo are able to name <b>Carbuncle</b> in the main game. According to Tabata, Platinum Demo served a dual purpose: it both introduced players to the gameplay mechanics, and gave them insight into Noctis' young life and his relationship with his father. It was originally intended to be a less emotive experience, but changed to being story-driven to better introduce players to the game's world. The demo was removed from sale on March 31, 2017. A virtual reality-based fishing simulation game titled [...] is set for release in September 2017. Suggested by Sony Interactive Entertainment and originally a first-person shooter featuring Prompto and based on the storyline of Episode Duscae, the project was reworked into its current form to promote immersion and entertainment.|$|E
500|$|The {{architecture}} at MediaCity {{has been}} criticised by {{the editor of}} Building Design magazine Ellis Woodman, who describes it as [...] "a crazed accumulation of development in which every aimlessly gesticulating building sports at least three different cladding treatments.

[...] The development was awarded the <b>Carbuncle</b> Cup by Building Design for the worst new building in 2011. Owen Hatherley writing in The Guardian criticised the development as [...] "an enclave, easily closed off from the life of the rest of the city".|$|E

500|$|Gawain's {{refusal of}} the Lady Bertilak's ring has major {{implications}} {{for the remainder of}} the story. While the modern student may tend to pay more attention to the girdle as the eminent object offered by the lady, readers in the time of Gawain would have noticed the significance of the offer of the ring as they believed that rings, and especially the embedded gems, had talismanic properties similarly done by the Gawain-poet in Pearl. This is especially true of the lady's ring as scholars believe it to be a ruby or <b>carbuncle,</b> indicated when the Gawain-Poet describes it as a [...] "brygt sunne" [...] (line 1819), a [...] "fiery sun." [...] This red colour can be seen as symbolizing royalty, divinity, and the Passion the Christ, something that Gawain as a knight of the Round Table would strive for, but this colour could also represent the negative qualities of temptation and covetousness. Given the importance of magic rings in Arthurian romance, this remarkable ring would also have been believed to protect the wearer from harm just as Lady Bertilak claims the girdle will.|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} {{addition to the}} building {{in recent years has}} been the Sainsbury Wing, designed by the postmodernist architects Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown to house the collection of Renaissance paintings, and built in 1991. The building occupies the [...] "Hampton's site" [...] to the west of the main building, where a department store of the same name had stood until its destruction in the Blitz. The Gallery had long sought expansion into this space and in 1982 a competition was held to find a suitable architect; the shortlist included a radical high-tech proposal by Richard Rogers, among others. The design that won the most votes was by the firm Ahrends, Burton and Koralek, who then modified their proposal to include a tower, similar to that of the Rogers scheme. The proposal was dropped after the Prince of Wales compared the design to a [...] "monstrous <b>carbuncle</b> on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend", The term [...] "monstrous carbuncle", for a modern building that clashes with its surroundings, has since become commonplace.|$|E
