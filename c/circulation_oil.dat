50|$|Electricity {{generation}} requires {{high temperature}} {{resources that can}} only come from deep underground. The heat must be carried to the surface by fluid circulation, either through magma conduits, hot springs, hydrothermal <b>circulation,</b> <b>oil</b> wells, drilled water wells, {{or a combination of}} these. This circulation sometimes exists naturally where the crust is thin: magma conduits bring heat close to the surface, and hot springs bring the heat to the surface. If no hot spring is available, a well must be drilled into a hot aquifer. Away from tectonic plate boundaries the geothermal gradient is 25-30 °C per kilometre (km) of depth in most of the world, and wells would have to be several kilometres deep to permit electricity generation. The quantity and quality of recoverable resources improves with drilling depth and proximity to tectonic plate boundaries.|$|E

An integrated satellite-aircraft-drogue approach has been developed which employs remotely tracked expendable drogues together with satellite and aircraft observations of waste plumes and tracers, such as dyes or suspended sediment.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} on a swashplate compressor to determine the state of lubrication. Measurements of electrical resistance were taken as a primary measure of oil film lubrication at the sliding shoe/swashplate interface. Two additional sensors were used to indirectly determine the state of compressor lubrication. These included an acoustic emission sensor mounted {{on the outside of}} the compressor and a dynamic pressure transducer mounted in the swashplate cavity of the compressor. The compressor lubrication experiments were performed on a mobile air conditioning test stand. The loop was modified to control and measure steady oil return to the compressor. Steady <b>oil</b> <b>circulation</b> conditions were controlled to determine effects of <b>oil</b> <b>circulation</b> rate, compressor speed, and condenser air inlet temperature on compressor lubrication. Furthermore, liquid refrigerant slugging and dry oil start up tests and an oil shut off test were conducted to study severe oil lubrication conditions on the compressor. This thesis outlines the instrumentation used on the compressor to determine the state of lubrication. Also included are the steady <b>oil</b> <b>circulation</b> test results. A second thesis, written by Chappell [2000], describes the techniques used to control and measure <b>oil</b> <b>circulation.</b> In addition, the transient <b>oil</b> <b>circulation</b> test conditions are presented, including the start up conditions and the oil shut off test.

In this study, distribution device was installed to ensure uniform flow distribution in the refrigerant flow passage, which enhances heat transfer performance of plate type heat exchanger.

40|$|In {{a closed}} loop vapor {{compression}} cycle, {{a small portion}} of the oil circulates with the refrigerant flow through the cycle components while most of the oil stays inside the compressor. The worst scenario of <b>oil</b> <b>circulation</b> in the refrigeration cycle is when large amounts of oil become logged in the system. Each cycle component has different amounts of oil retention. Because oil retention in refrigeration systems can affect performance and compressor reliability, it receives continuous attention from manufactures and operators. Thus, the objective of this dissertation is to develop and use a method to experimentally and theoretically investigate the oil retention behavior in a refrigeration system on a component by component level. The test facility for the oil retention study mainly consists of a refrigeration loop and an oil loop. An oil injection-extraction method was developed to measure the oil retention at each component of the cycle. As the <b>oil</b> <b>circulation</b> ratio increases, the oil retention volume in the heat exchanger and suction line also increases. 16 % and 10 % of the total oil amount charged initially is retained in heat exchangers at 5 wt. % of <b>oil</b> <b>circulation</b> ratio for the refrigerant mass flux, 290 kg/m 2 s and 414 kg/m 2 s, respectively...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a non-invasive method {{to calculate the}} oil retention and <b>oil</b> <b>circulation</b> ratio (OCR) based on oil film thickness, oil film average velocity, oil droplet size, oil droplet velocity, and system mass flow rate.

The estimated oil retention and <b>oil</b> <b>circulation</b> ratio results are compared quantitatively with the measurements from experimental sampling under different compressor speed. The agreement between video results and sampling measurements verify {{the accuracy of the}} non-invasive method, which can be applied in other annular-mist flow analysis. It is also shown that most of the oil exists in film by mass while oil droplets contributes more to the oil mass flow rate because oil droplets travel in a much higher speed...|$|R

40|$|A {{traditional}} {{method of}} controlling evaporator superheat in a vapor compression {{air conditioning system}} is the thermostatic expansion valve (TXV). Such systems are often used in automotive applications. The TXV depends on superheat to adjust the valve opening. Unfortunately, any amount of superheat causes that evaporator to operate at reduced capacity due to dramatically lower heat transfer coefficients in the superheated region. In addition, <b>oil</b> <b>circulation</b> back to the compressor is impeded. The cold lubricant almost devoid of dissolved refrigerant is quite viscous and clings to the evaporator walls. A system that could control an air conditioner to operate with no superheat would either decrease {{the size of its}} existing evaporator while maintaining the same capacity, or potentially increase its capacity with its original evaporator. Also, <b>oil</b> <b>circulation</b> back to the compressor would be improved. To operate at this twophase evaporator exit condition a feedback sensor would have to quantify the quality of liquid mass fraction (when the exit stream is a mixture of droplets and superheated vapor) of the refrigerant exiting the evaporator.

30|$|Drilling {{the first}} well was difficult, costly {{and ended with}} {{abandonment}} of the well due to lost <b>circulation</b> of <b>oil.</b> Various types of measures were taken during drilling of a test borehole in the second well, (Well 22) which was performed as an exploratory well aimed at the mid-lower Abu Gabra formation at the proposed depth of 2700  mKB and was safely completed. However, the high mud density caused extensive damage to the nearer well area, which also distracted the hypothetical oil rate of flow that does not represent the real reservoir characteristics, burdened with additional risk of poor test design for testing time and huge pressure noise. In view of this anomaly, it is not logical to consider that the test cannot be saved from being run on an inappropriate source of data.|$|R
