5|$|Linear motions (or {{translatory}} motions), which {{move in a}} {{line between}} two points. Rectilinear motion is motion {{in a straight line}} between two points, whereas <b>curvilinear</b> motion is motion following a curved path.|$|E
5|$|Lunar swirls are enigmatic {{features}} found {{across the}} Moon's surface, which {{are characterized by}} a high albedo, appearing optically immature (i.e. the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith), and often displaying a sinuous shape. Their <b>curvilinear</b> shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls.|$|E
5|$|Pitted terrain {{has been}} {{observed}} in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, Cornelia, Numisia and Licinia. The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted terrain, <b>curvilinear</b> gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The <b>curvilinear</b> gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain, and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by {{the heat of the}} impacts. Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material. Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite, which was deposited on the surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.|$|E
5|$|The Naulakha Pavilion is {{an iconic}} {{sight of the}} Lahore Fort built in 1633 during the Shah Jahan period that is made of {{prominent}} white marble, and known for its distinctive <b>curvilinear</b> roof. It cost around 900,000 rupees, an exorbitant amount at the time. The structure derives {{its name from the}} Urdu word for 900,000, Naulakha.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mathematician}} {{to discover}} the existence of curves of constant width, and to observe that the Reuleaux triangle has constant width, may have been Leonhard Euler. In a paper that he presented in 1771 and published in 1781 entitled De curvis triangularibus, Euler studied <b>curvilinear</b> triangles {{as well as the}} curves of constant width, which he called orbiforms.|$|E
5|$|The rotor of the Wankel {{engine is}} shaped as a <b>curvilinear</b> {{triangle}} {{that is often}} cited {{as an example of}} a Reuleaux triangle. However, its curved sides are somewhat flatter than those of a Reuleaux triangle and so it does not have constant width.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 15th century, <b>curvilinear</b> {{perspective}} {{found its way into}} paintings by artists interested in image distortions. Jan van Eyck's 1434 Arnolfini Portrait contains a convex mirror with reflections {{of the people in the}} scene, while Parmigianino's Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror, c. 1523–1524, shows the artist's largely undistorted face at the centre, with a strongly curved background and artist's hand around the edge.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} {{included the}} repetition of <b>Curvilinear</b> or flame-like forms that occur in {{a great number of}} windows of around 1320, notably in the retro-choir at Wells and the nave of Exeter Cathedral. This type of tracery is often seen in combination with vaulting ribs of extreme projection and very rich moulding, as is seen in the chapter house at Wells, and the vault at Exeter, which stretches, uninterrupted by a central tower, for 91 metres (300ft) and is the longest medieval vault in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was {{designed in the}} Art Nouveau style, which {{was at that time}} a relatively new style and featured flowing, <b>curvilinear</b> designs often incorporating floral and other plant-inspired motifs. Horodecki featured such motifs in the building's exterior decor in the forms of mythical creatures and big-game animals. His work on the House with Chimaeras has earned him the nickname of the Gaudí of Kiev.|$|E
5|$|The deltoid {{curve is}} {{another type of}} <b>curvilinear</b> triangle, but {{one in which the}} curves {{replacing}} each side of an equilateral triangle are concave rather than convex. It is not composed of circular arcs, but may be formed by rolling one circle within another of three times the radius. Other planar shapes with three curved sides include the arbelos, which is formed from three semicircles with collinear endpoints, and the Bézier triangle.|$|E
5|$|The last {{stage of}} <b>Curvilinear</b> or Flowing Decorated Gothic, is {{expressed}} in tracery of very varied and highly complex forms. Many {{of the largest and}} most famous windows of England date from 1320–30 and are in this style. They include the south transept rose window known as the “Bishop’s Eye” at Lincoln, the “Heart of Yorkshire” window in the west end of York and the famous nine-light east window of Carlisle.|$|E
5|$|Images of the parshvadevatas (attendant deities) {{are placed}} in the central niches of the outer wall (bada) on three sides: the eight-armed Durga slaying Mahishasura on the south; the six-armed goddess Chamunda {{standing}} on Shiva on the west and an empty niche on the north, which probably had a goddess figure that was stolen. The lintel of the attendant deity niche has Gaja Lakshmi figurines. The frames of the niches are decorated with scrollwork and kirtimukha motifs and two female attendants accompany each niche. The uppermost part of the outer wall has ten horizontal mouldings, ornate with scrollwork, kirtimukha and lotus and floral motifs. Within the vimana lies the garbhagriha (sanctum), which is topped with a pancharatha-style, <b>curvilinear</b> temple pinnacle.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) {{announced}} {{a campaign to}} redesign the buildings on the island, and six designs were submitted. One of the designs removed the existing buildings and piers to replace them with walking paths, and added a large <b>curvilinear</b> concrete building to the island. The design called for many windows in the building to create a large panorama of the surrounding seascape. In September 2010 Urban Splash placed the pier up for sale, citing a downfall in business caused by the recession as their reason.|$|E
5|$|The Decorated Gothic style, with traceried windows, {{is further}} {{subdivided}} dependent upon whether the tracery is Geometric or <b>Curvilinear.</b> Many cathedrals have important {{parts in the}} Geometric style of the mid 13th to early 14th centuries, including much of Lincoln, Lichfield, the choir of Ely and the chapter houses of Salisbury and Southwell. By the late 13th century the style of tracery evolved to include {{a greater number of}} narrow shapes that adapted easily to Gothic openings in combination with circular shapes {{as can be seen in}} the windows of the chapter house of York, the Octagon of Ely and the west window of Exeter.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} smaller {{architectural}} works within cathedrals {{which have the}} <b>curvilinear</b> tracery. These include the arcading in the Lady Chapel at Ely, which also has the widest vault in England, the pulpitum screen at Lincoln and richly decorated doorways at Ely and Rochester. Characteristic of this period of Gothic is elaborate lierne vaulting in which the main ribs are connected by intermediate ribs which do not spring {{from the wall and}} so are not major structural members. The vaults of Bristol are the most famous examples of this style, which can also be seen at York.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{stones and}} {{materials}} were salvaged {{and used to}} rebuild the Hawkins priory in Virginia, the reconstructed house incorporated other designs and influences. Following the acquisition of the Warwickshire property, the Weddells hired chief architect Henry Grant Morse and scouted the English countryside, surveying properties and considering various designs they could incorporate into the rebuilding process. As a result, the reconstruction is not {{a replica of the}} original building. The west wing of the house is actually a replica of Sulgrave Manor, a small manor house in Northamptonshire, England, which once belonged to Lawrence Washington, an ancestor of America's first president, George Washington. However, the center of the house is a reproduction of the original Warwickshire priory and uses the <b>curvilinear</b> gables, strapwork design, and balustrades that the English commonly adapted from the Low Countries in the early seventeenth century. The east wing of the house, however, is based on Wormleighton Manor, a Spencer-Churchill family estate in England.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time there was a change in castle architecture. Until the late 12thcentury castles {{generally}} had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrowslits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by {{the lay of the land}} (the result was often irregular or <b>curvilinear</b> structures). The design of castles was not uniform, but these were features that could be found in a typical castle in the mid-12thcentury. By the end of the 12thcentury or the early 13thcentury, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in shape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level to allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{tectonics}} on Enceladus is also {{derived from}} grooved terrain, consisting of lanes of <b>curvilinear</b> grooves and ridges. These bands, first discovered by Voyager 2, often separate smooth plains from cratered regions. Grooved terrains {{such as the}} Samarkand Sulci are reminiscent of grooved terrain on Ganymede. However, unlike those seen on Ganymede, grooved topography on Enceladus is generally more complex. Rather than parallel sets of grooves, these lanes often appear as bands of crudely aligned, chevron-shaped features. In other areas, these bands bow upwards with fractures and ridges running {{the length of the}} feature. Cassini observations of the Samarkand Sulci have revealed dark spots (125 and 750 m wide) located parallel to the narrow fractures. Currently, these spots are interpreted as collapse pits within these ridged plain belts.|$|E

25|$|In practice, {{the above}} {{definition}} is rarely used because {{in virtually all}} cases, the curl operator can be applied using some set of <b>curvilinear</b> coordinates, for which simpler representations have been derived.|$|E
25|$|While {{playing music}} during a field show, the band makes {{a series of}} formations, called drill, on the field, which may be pictures, {{geometric}} shapes, <b>curvilinear</b> designs, or blocks of musicians, although sometimes it may be pure abstract designs using no specific form.|$|E
25|$|A heavily ornamented three-bay facade is {{shaded by}} two gazebo-like front terraces. Each bay {{consists}} {{of a series of}} four Corinthian columns upon pedestals, arranged around a 3/4-circle plan. Decorative wrought-iron railings in <b>curvilinear</b> Art Nouveau designs span between each of the pedestals.|$|E
25|$|The valley's rich archaeological {{heritage}} {{also includes the}} remains of at least five large prehistoric compound or <b>curvilinear</b> sites incorporating the remains of round houses, stockyards and more. One of these sites is on a public footpath at Tongue House {{in the northern part}} of the valley.|$|E
25|$|The {{asymmetric}} knot allows {{to produce}} more fluent, often <b>curvilinear</b> designs, while more bold, rectilinear designs may use the symmetric knot. As exemplified by Senneh rugs with their elaborate designs woven with symmetric knots, {{the quality of the}} design depends more on the weaver's skills, than on the type of knot which is used.|$|E
25|$|At the {{south-east}} {{corner of}} the piazza is the elegant Baroque church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, better known by its earlier designation of Santa Caterina. A master-work of Giovanni Battista Scapitta, completed after his death by Giacomo Zanetti, it is marked by an elliptical cupola, and a façade <b>curvilinear</b> both in plan and elevation.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{consultation}} — The {{plastic surgeon}} explains {{the technical and}} aesthetic considerations of the breast lift operation to the woman. That the B technique mastopexy yields improved aesthetic results with a breast-skin pedicle created with a <b>curvilinear</b> incision (an inverted, upper-case letter-B). That said <b>curvilinear</b> incision technique eliminates the medial vertical incision of the Anchor mastopexy, and so creates a lifted bust with breasts of natural size, appearance, and contour, and few surgical scars. The consultation includes detailed, pre-operative, post-operative, and healing-stage photographs that illustrate {{the nature and extent}} of the mastopexy incisions and the resultant scars. That the full healing (scar maturation) might require approximately one year to establish the final contour of the lifted breasts, after the suspensory ligaments and the parenchymal tissue have settled into and upon the chest as an aesthetically satisfactory bust of natural size, appearance, and contour.|$|E
25|$|The Tiwanaku {{created a}} {{powerful}} ideology, using previous Andean icons that were widespread throughout their sphere of influence. They used extensive trade routes and shamanistic art. Tiwanaku art consisted of legible, outlined figures depicted in <b>curvilinear</b> style with a naturalistic manner, while Wari art {{used the same}} symbols in a more abstract, rectilinear style with a militaristic style.|$|E
25|$|This {{manuscript}} {{was decorated}} and embellished with four painted full-page miniatures, {{major and minor}} letters, continuing panels, and litterae notibiliores. The ornamental elements include zoomorphic/animal, floral, interlace, and <b>curvilinear</b> motifs and designs. The color palette employed by the artist/illuminator consisted of pigments of gold, purple, blues, red, red/brown, yellow, green, white, and black. The pigment binding medium was clarified egg white or clarea.|$|E
25|$|At a {{time when}} Minkowski was giving the {{geometrical}} interpretation of special relativity by extending the Euclidean three-space to a quasi-Euclidean four-space that included time, Einstein was already aware {{that this is not}} valid, because it excludes the phenomenon of gravitation. He was still far from the study of <b>curvilinear</b> coordinates and Riemannian geometry, and the heavy mathematical apparatus entailed.|$|E
25|$|Gogó da Ema was {{a famous}} palm tree with a crooked trunk roughly shaped like a <b>curvilinear</b> letter N. The tree fell on July 27, 1955 at 2:20 in the afternoon.
