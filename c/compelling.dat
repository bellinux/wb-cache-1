5|$|The Act violates rights {{protected}} by the First Amendment because the state has not demonstrated a <b>compelling</b> interest, has not tailored the restriction to its alleged <b>compelling</b> interest, and there exists a less-restrictive means that would further the State's expressed interest.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has <b>compelling</b> {{evidence}} against the existence of God. I know of no such <b>compelling</b> evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman press {{reported}} {{the action on}} 31 October, claiming that the Russians had planned on mining the Bosphorus and destroying their fleet without a formal declaration of war, <b>compelling</b> the Ottoman navy to retaliate after an engagement at sea by bombarding the Russian coast.|$|E
40|$|At present, it is {{difficult}} to discern what rules govern <b>compelled</b> subsidization and where the constitutional limits lie. The root cause of the current confusion is the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s failure to provide a coherent account of the First Amendment harm of <b>compelled</b> subsidization. Part I of this Article describes the present state of the doctrine. It identifies a number of practical problems, especially the imprecisions in and conflicts between the Court 2 ̆ 7 s holdings that leave it unclear how lower courts should decide novel cases. Part II is a critical discussion of the two most common arguments for a First Amendment right against <b>compelled</b> subsidization: that <b>compelled</b> subsidization infringes on dissenters 2 ̆ 7 freedom of belief and that it restricts their freedom of expression. A comparison of <b>compelled</b> subsidization with the First Amendment interests at stake in <b>compelled</b> speech shows that neither argument withstands scrutiny and that this deficiency in theory is the cause of much of the confusion in practice. Part III argues {{that if there is a}} First Amendment right against <b>compelled</b> subsidization, it is grounded not in the liberty interests of dissenting individuals, but in <b>compelled</b> subsidization 2 ̆ 7 s potential harm to public political discourse. This brings a fresh perspective on the idea that there is a First Amendment interest in 2 ̆ 2 democratizing the influence of money on the electoral process, 2 ̆ 2 and suggests a new, more general test for <b>compelled</b> subsidization cases. Part IV briefly discusses what it would take to transpose the results from a reformed <b>compelled</b> subsidization doctrine into the register of campaign finance regulation...|$|R

40|$|Courts {{have faced}} {{a wave of}} <b>compelled</b> {{disclosure}} cases recently. By government mandate, tobacco manufacturers must include graphic warnings on their cigarette packages, doctors must show and describe ultrasound images of fetuses to women seeking to abort them, and crisis pregnancy centers must disclose {{that they do not}} provide contraception or abortion services. Although applying the same <b>compelled</b> speech doctrine to similar issues, appeals courts have reached very different results in challenges to these laws. Drawing from First Amendment theory, this Article first identifies why <b>compelled</b> disclosures undermine free speech values. It then applies those insights to the specific examples above. In doing so, it examines not only <b>compelled</b> text but the new phenomenon of <b>compelled</b> images, particularly <b>compelled</b> images designed to provoke an emotional response. The Article concludes that court decisions often have it backwards: it is mandatory abortion counseling laws that offend free speech principles, not laws requiring cigarette warnings or crisis pregnancy center disclosures...|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} {{criticisms of the}} three-tiered {{scrutiny}} analysis, the most <b>compelling</b> reason against its adoption arguably being {{that it does not}} control judicial discretion: the identification of classifications as suspect, quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing of public and private interests, and political and social interests.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{transition in}} her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and {{sold as a}} set. They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's publication of A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced a <b>compelling</b> version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{understanding}} genes and inheritance continued throughout the 20th century. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{was shown to}} be the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s. The structure of DNA was studied by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins using X-ray crystallography, which led James D. Watson and Francis Crick to publish {{a model of the}} double-stranded DNA molecule whose paired nucleotide bases indicated a <b>compelling</b> hypothesis for the mechanism of genetic replication.|$|E
40|$|<b>Compelled</b> {{commercial}} speech, including mandatory labeling and {{the disclosure}} of factually true information, should {{not be seen as}} a separate category of speech under the First Amendment. Rather, <b>compelled</b> commercial speech should be subject to the same level of protection as commercial speech generally. This means commercial speech compulsions, such as mandatory disclosures and labeling requirements, must be supported by a substantial government interest. The assertion of a consumer “right to know” does not constitute such an interest and cannot, by itself, justify <b>compelled</b> commercial speech. Allowing such a justification for <b>compelled</b> commercial speech would eviscerate any meaningful First Amendment protection against <b>compelled</b> commercial speech and, threaten core First Amendment values. Such protection against speech compulsions will not inhibit government efforts to protect consumers nor prevent consumers from obtaining desired information about products and services. A dynamic market discovery process, with only limited and targeted government interventions, is a more effective way to serve the consumer interest in more complete information about goods and services. Most existing <b>compelled</b> disclosure requirements are consistent with this approach to <b>compelled</b> commercial speech, but some new and proposed disclosure requirements, including those for genetically modified organisms, are likely unconstitutional...|$|R

Taking advantage of Bohemond's absence, Nur ad-Din attacked the fortress at Harenc in the Principality of Antioch (present-day Harem, Syria). Bohemond, RaymondIII of Tripoli, ThorosII of Armenian Cilicia, and Constantine Kalamanos joined their forces and marched to Harenc, <b>compelling</b> Nur ad-Din to retreat.|$|E
5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a <b>compelling</b> government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that <b>compelling</b> interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E
