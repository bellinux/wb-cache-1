During the summer of 1991, the LMAQR states sponsored the Lake Michigan Ozone Study (LMOS), which included a comprehensive field measurement program to gather data to understand the complex meteorology and air quality of that region and to verify predictions from air quality models. Air quality and meteorological data were collected by aircraft, surface monitors, rawinsondes, and radar wind profilers to characterize pollutant distributions and understand transport regimes. The unique meteorology of the LMAQR and the stable conditions over the lake produce several transport regimes.

There are three kinds of carriers, each with a different behavior: conduction-like holes in the Cu-O 2 layers and electrons and normal holes in the CTI matrix between the Cu-O 2 layers. This structure explains the strong anisotropies. The relationship is obtained between the concentration nq of conduction-like holes in the Cu-O 2 layers and the temperature T. The anomalous temperature behavior of the resistivity {{as well as the}} Hall constant also follows. We give the hole density in ab plane a definite physical meaning, and also define explicitly optimal doping, overdoping and underdoping. Our model gives the correct temperature dependence of the resistivity and the hole constant on optimal doping, overdoping and underdoping, and it predicts the temperature behavior of the cotangent of the Hall angle quite well.
