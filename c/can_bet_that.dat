500|$|Niels Matthijs, {{writing for}} Twitch Film, stated that [...] "It's astounding how van Dormael turns each scene into a unique little {{cinematic}} event. There is hardly filler here, no scenes to drag out the running time or to fill some gaps in between other climaxes. Every scene matters and every scene {{is made to}} look like it matters. The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested {{in the life of the}} main protagonist, Nemo Nobody." [...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful. No matter what he chooses, he experiences heartbreak, death of loved ones, his own death, and clinical depression. My future seems brighter, but the film makes the strong point that every experience is worthwhile. The goal isn't to choose the easiest path. It's to live." [...] Chris Holt from Starburst magazine wrote that [...] "Mr. Nobody is a film that is remarkable by its very existence and that in itself is something to be happy about. You may love it you may hate it, but you <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> you will never forget it." [...] Exclaim!s Robert Bell called the film [...] "a powerful movie about what it means to be alive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sandé {{said the}} key to a {{successful}} song was simplicity. The singer pointed out that she could never have used songs which she wrote when she was 17 because she made the songs too complicated; saying there were too many words and parts to the track. She stated that the key feature to a classical song was keeping the [...] "melody simple" [...] and having big [...] "lyric effective", which was much easier said than actually done. Sandé said that another important key to a good song when songwriting is using [...] "honesty" [...] and [...] "raw emotion" [...] as the best way to write. She said that if she attempts to write something which is [...] "too smart" [...] the creative process will not work for her. [...] "Kill the Boy" [...] {{was one of the first}} ideas that came to Sandé's head. If she has to work on a song longer than a day, she will not go back to it because it won't work. She went on to say if it was to work, the idea for the song would be almost instant. Sandé said that all her songs are about world peace and political issues. She is the same person since gaining the record deal with Virgin Records, and they are the same songs which she planned for the album before gaining the deal. She said that a lot of people didn't see the potential in the songs or in her, but once she gained the record deal, she gained more confidence. [...] "When you get knocked back so much you kind of learn to believe in yourself, stand up for yourself, because you <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> nobody else is going to do it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, to-day, just now, when I {{was riding}} {{up the valley}} road I came upon the same fellows. They had {{instruments}} and were surveying. Remembering Dick, and how he always wished for an instrument to help work out his plan for irrigation, I was certainly surprised to see these strangers surveying--and surveying upon Laddy's plot of land. It was a sandy road there, and Jose happened to be walking. So I reined in and asked these engineers what they were doing. The leader, who was that same bold fellow who had followed me, seemed much pleased at being addressed. He was swaggering--too friendly; not my idea of a gentleman at all. He said {{he was glad to}} tell me he was going to run water all over Altar Valley. Dad, you <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> made me wild. That was Dick's plan, his discovery, and here were surveyors on Laddy's claim.|$|E

5000|$|Mesoblast's {{solution}} for back pain came under heavy criticism from competitor Regenexx in August 2015. Dr. Chris Centeno said the trial results were [...] "spit shined" [...] with confusing and misleading language, press releases for phases 1 and 2 {{did not include}} images of MRIs to prove that discs were regenerated and expressed doubts about maintaining cell quality while mass-producing cells. He also said the host's immune system removes the injected stem cells. [...] Centeno said: [...] "Whenever you see a company drop key imaging results that are needed to impress insurers (like positive MRI changes in the spine) you <b>can</b> almost <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> there are serious troubles brewing. Then when you observe that what should take a few sentences to describe {{whether or not the}} product helped pain and function actually takes an entire page of reported numbers sliced and diced 10 different ways, you know there are serious issues." ...|$|R

I don't pretend to know much about international affairs but {{one thing you}} can put down as settled is that Germany will be a Hohenzollern empire for the next forty years.

50|$|This {{is similar}} to parimutuel <b>betting,</b> in <b>that</b> the {{winnings}} are awarded from the total pool of bets, but differs in that only one player <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> on any one contestant. However, a player may purchase as many contestants as they desire.|$|R
5000|$|Bet cancellation: If a bettor places bets {{so as to}} make an {{arbitrage}} and one bookmaker cancels a bet, the bettor {{could find}} himself in a bad position because he is actually betting with all the risks implied. The bettor <b>can</b> repeat the <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> has been cancelled so as minimize the risk, but if he cannot get the same odds he had before he may be forced to take a loss. In some cases the situation arises when there are very high potential payouts by the bookmaker, perhaps due to an unintentional error made while quoting odds. Many jurisdictions allow bookmakers to cancel bets in the event of such a [...] "palpable" [...] "obvious" [...] error in the quoted odds This is often loosely defined as an obvious mistake, but whether a [...] "palp" [...] in fact has been made is often the sole discretion of the bookmaker.|$|R

40|$|We present {{quantitative}} {{relations between}} work and information that are valid both for finite sized and internally correlated systems {{as well in the}} thermodynamical limit. We suggest work extraction should be viewed as a game where the amount of work an agent can extract depends on how well it can guess the micro-state of the system. In general it depends both on the agent's knowledge and risk-tolerance, because the agent <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> on facts <b>that</b> are not certain and thereby risk failure of the work extraction. We derive strikingly simple expressions for the extractable work in the extreme cases of effectively zero- and arbitrary risk tolerance respectively, thereby enveloping all cases. Our derivation makes a connection between heat engines and the smooth entropy approach. The latter has recently extended Shannon theory to encompass finite sized and internally correlated bit strings, and our analysis points the way to an analogous extension of statistical mechanics.

60|$|Enough! I hated Kerner, {{and one day}} I met him and {{we became}} friends. He was young and gloriously melancholy because his spirits were so high and life had so much in store for him. Yes, he was almost riotously sad. That was his youth. When a man begins to be hilarious in a sorrowful way you <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> a million <b>that</b> he is dyeing his hair. Kerner's hair was {{plentiful}} and carefully matted as an artist's thatch should be. He was a cigaretteur, and he audited his dinners with red wine. But, most of all, he was a fool. And, wisely, I envied him, and listened patiently while he knocked Velasquez and Tintoretto. Once {{he told me that}} he liked a story of mine that he had come across in an anthology. He described it to me, and I was sorry that Mr. Fitz-James O'Brien was dead and could not learn of the eulogy of his work. But mostly Kerner made few breaks and was a consistent fool.|$|R
50|$|The Neo-Futurist {{aesthetic}} {{demands that}} everything that transpires in their theater be non-illusory, {{which is to say}} that they pretend nothing; actors only play themselves. All plays take place on a stage, specifically, the stage on which they are performed, in the present. If one of the performers reports that something has happened, you <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> it really happened. Much of their work contains the possibility of failure, a unique theatrical component that keeps them and the audience honest. Their plays are wildly eclectic, touching on all genres and tones; plays may be political, satirical, personal, tragic, comic, abstract, musical, surreal, poetic, and so on.|$|E
5000|$|Adam Hughes of Yahoo! TV {{reported}} that Branson {{had become a}} fan favorite, calling him a [...] "crowd pleasing detective", {{and that was the}} reason for his return in August 2011. He wrote: [...] "Ronans story is a typically twisted tale of intrigue, misunderstanding, betrayal and redemption. The basic gist is that he was stolen from his mother, Nina Webster, when he was just a baby and promptly disappeared from the shows landscape." [...] Hughes also wrote of Ronan returning to solve Diane Jenkins (Maura West) murder, saying: [...] "All of this is great theater, and you <b>can</b> <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> producers and writers will milk the story for all its worth, potentially allowing Branson the opportunity to cultivate his character into something more permanent." [...] When Bransons exit in November 2012 was announced, Jamey Giddens of Zap2it wrote: [...] "Jeff Branson has had more stints on The Young and the Restless than Sharon Newman in the funny farm." [...] He also said that it was a [...] "bummer" [...] to see Branson leave, as he thought the characters relationship with Phyllis was [...] "smoking hot". In 2013, Branson received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Ronan.|$|E

Mekaal Hasan Band's (MHB's) third studio album, Andholan is the first release of theirs to feature a new and improved Indo-Pak line-up that features the recorded debut and introduction of Indian singer, Sharmistha Chatterjee on lead vocals. Mekaal Hasan and Mohammad Ahsan Papu, who were the founding members of this critically acclaimed music group, reprise their roles as lead guitarist and flautist, respectively, with Indian heavyweights and band members Gino Banks and Shledon D'Silva joining them on their live performances. The innovative songwriting process that went into the making of this album incorporates the sounds of classic jazz-rock groups from the 70's, classical/Sufi music melodies and a dash of rock fusion to make this a thoroughly exquisite album. From the adrenalin-pumping introductory song [...] "Ghungat" [...] to the tranquility-evoking, conclusive track “Kinarey”, this album will leave you in a state of spellbinding bliss.|$|E

Well, I won't run for the place, so it'll be Homans. He's the man to captain us, that's certain. Graves thinks, though, that he can pull the wires and be elected captain. He's way off. Besides, Peg, he's making a big mistake. Worry doesn't like him, and when he finds out about this break in {{training}} we'll have a new third-baseman. No doubt Blake will play the bag. Graves is the only drag in Worry's baseball machine now, and he'll not last.... So, Peg, don't think any more about it. Mind you, the whole team circles round you. You're the pivot, and as sure as you're born you'll be Wayne's captain next year. That's something for you {{to keep in mind}} and work for. If Graves keeps after you--hand him one!
