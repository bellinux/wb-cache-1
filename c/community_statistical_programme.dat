40|$|The goal of {{the present}} poster is to {{summarize}} current state of affairs in Ukrainian statistical education which is an integral element of the higher education curriculum. Professional statisticians are being trained at 8 higher education institutions (3 are located in Kyiv, and 1 {{in each of the}} following cities: Kharkiv, Odesa, Lviv, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk) using curricula developed according to the standard for Applied Statistics discipline. There exists a certain deficit of professionally-trained specialists to work in the central and regional state statistics bureaus. The task of filling this gap as well as further development of the specialist training for the state statistics is addressed in the “State Statistics Development Strategy 2012 ”. This document has the same priorities as the Ukraine-European Union Action Plan and Eurostat’s <b>Community</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Programme</b> 2008 to 2012. The above mentioned higher education institutions teach statistics throughout the period of studies both in the framework of general mathematical curriculum: mathematical statistics, theory of probabilities, econometrics and as a part of vocational (professional) training: theory of statistics, statistical modeling and forecasting, economic statistics, national accounts statistics, social statistics, demographic statistics, international statistics, market statistics, labour statistics...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an {{autoimmune}} blistering {{disease of}} the skin characterized by autoantibody attack on collagen XVII. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the genetic complexity of COL 17 A 1, the gene which encodes for the autoantigen collagen XVII. The data {{will be used to}} determine whether there is an association between polymorphisms and haplotypes of COL 17 A 1 and genetic susceptibility to development of BP. METHODS: The genetic complexity in COL 17 A 1 was deduced by screening and then sequencing the gene. Haplotypes were constructed from the resulting polymorphisms using the <b>statistical</b> <b>programme</b> PHASE. The linkage disequilibrium (D') between the polymorphisms was deduced from haplotypic data using the <b>statistical</b> <b>programme</b> GOLD. Association of the polymorphisms and haplotypes was tested for, in a cohort of BP patients and controls. RESULTS: Screening of COL 17 A 1 for genetic variation was carried out in 29 individuals of North European caucasoid origin, and it revealed 19 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in approximately 14. 7 kb of sequence. These variants resulted in 60 different haplotypes in 191 individuals, of which 13 occurred above 1 % in the population. D' between the variants was found to be extensive, have a low correlation with physical distance and to extend over 33. 8 kb. No association was found with any of the polymorphisms or haplotypes and development of BP, when tested for, in a cohort of patients and controls. CONCLUSION: This study provides an extensive description of the genetic variation in COL 17 A 1 and shows no association of the genetic variants with susceptibility to BP...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} {{and the experience of}} the development of <b>Community</b> <b>Statistical</b> Systems deriving from the original Community Information Network movement in the 1980 s. The paper traces the evolution of these systems into the second generation of Neighborhood Information Systems 1, or <b>Community</b> <b>Statistical</b> Systems, which with the development of technology provide powerful integration of multiple databases for improved community outcomes. This paper provides a conceptual review of the development of <b>Community</b> <b>Statistical</b> Systems and their precedents in Neighborhood Information Systems and Community Information Networks. The paper presents findings {{for the development of a}} new approach to the effective deployment of <b>Community</b> <b>Statistical</b> Systems. 2 Geographic Information Systems technology enables mapping of any number of neighborhood trends and patterns. By combining layers of information about a place, GIS enables comprehensive evaluations of the area and the development of Neighborhood Information Systems (NISs) that build integrated data sets. There are two levels of NIS use that fulfill different purposes: "transactional" use based on individual points of data and "analytical" use based on the transformation of data into information. Typically, neighborhood information systems are used by community groups to find specific information about individual property parcels. That, in and of itself, can help promote better community development. However, information about individual property values, for example, has limited use in revealing patterns for the neighborhood as a whole. On the other hand, in the aggregate, analysis of house values can be used to develop neighborhood price indexes, which in turn can be powerful indicators of the relative economic health of different neighborhoods across time and space. The two uses have different functions. One supplies raw data about land or housing parcels, while the other provides information on the community. However, in general, <b>community</b> <b>statistical</b> systems and neighborhood information systems cannot easily supply the totality of these data sets to support this second function, nor can they update these data in a timely fashion. We propose here the development of a new approach and a new model for neighborhood information systems. To date, most such systems are hosted at a single location by a single server provide by a data intermediary. The power of an NIS derives from the integration of multiple data layers for interpretation, analysis and discovery of patterns; the relevant data sets change, depending on the user. Space and cost limitations make database storage of all relevant data sets unwieldy and probably infeasible. The alternative and better approach is to develop a distributed web strategy with a different role for the data intermediary. Instead of hosting all requisite databases (and having to continually update them), the databases would instead remain with the original data providers and the intermediary would facilitate the connections between different databases and the end-user. The intermediary would also develop compatibility protocols to ensure that all databases can be integrated into the same GIS template. In addition, protocols for automatic updating of data sets and for determining access would be functions of the intermediary. The potential for this new model of NIS is great since ultimately access could be provided to relevant administrative data sets, currently used for the day to day business of governments, which could then be deployed for informing and improving community development policies. 1 The Wharton Real Estate Department Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Lab of the University of Pennsylvania developed a Neighborhood Information System (NIS) prototype with the support of a grant from the Fannie Mae Foundation. 2 An annotated bibliography of relevant literature is provided in Appendix 1. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Spinal {{injury is}} {{a major cause of}} morbidity, {{mortality}} and long bed occupancy in patients admitted in Mulago Hospital. Several studies have reported different incidence and presentations of spinal injury 1 - 4. At Mulago hospital, road traffic crushes (RTC) {{is one of the most}} common causes of these injuries 5. However the magnitude of the problem is unknown and this impacts on planning of services. The main objective was to determine the prevalence and presentation of spinal injury among patients with major trauma admitted at Mulago hospital, Kampala. Method: A Cross-sectional descriptive study was done on 669 patients with major trauma admitted in the Accident and Emergency ward of Mulago Hospital. Newly admitted patients were consecutively enrolled in the study. Data was collected using questionnaires capturing information from relevant history, physical examination and X-ray interpretation. This was done between November 2008 and January 2009. Data was entered into the Epi-data <b>statistical</b> <b>programme</b> and exported to SPSS <b>statistical</b> <b>programme</b> for analysis. Results: Of the 669 patients enrolled, 59 had spinal injury thus giving a prevalence of 8. 8 %. Most of the patients had Neurological involvement and Frankel A was the most common neurological sign. All patients had X-rays done and fracture was the most common radiological diagnosis and the majority of the respondents had unstable spine. Long bone fractures were the most common associated injury. Conclusions and recommendation: The prevalence of Spinal injury among the trauma patients is 8. 8 % with Frankel A score being the most common neurological injury, while fractures being the most common radiological diagnosis. There should be measures instituted by the policy makers to prevent spinal injury. The hospital should be fully equipped to manage spinal injury patients before they go back into the community...|$|R
