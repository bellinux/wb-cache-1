Kelly to disclose any statement which had been made to him in the confessional, and, in this sense, his words may be said to give some support to the Catholic <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>privilege</b> for sacramental confession. The Encyclopedia further observes, [...] "But we need not wonder that he was not ready to extend the protection to the act of restitution, though, even in the eyes of non-Catholics, it ought, in all logic, to have been entitled to the same secrecy, in view of the circumstances under which, obviously, it was made." ...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{unsettled}} areas of privilege law in Australia {{is the extent to}} which advice provided by in-house counsel is protected. In Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No. 2), Justice Graham of the Federal Court of Australia refused a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>privilege</b> over advice provided by in-house counsel of Telstra, holding 'an in-house lawyer will lack the requisite measure of independence if his or her advice is at risk of being compromised by virtue of the nature of his employment relationship with his employer'. This created concerns in the legal community as to the extent that in-house legal advice is protected from disclosure to a court. Justice Graham did not set out any measures or criteria for determining when an in-house lawyer is sufficiently independent of his or her employer.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary music {{education}} exists {{in an age}} of privatisation, marketization and advocacy. As an increasing number of {{music education}} ‘providers’ compete for finite and often decreasing resources (both financial and time-bound), more and more ambitious and speculative <b>claims</b> are made <b>for</b> the benefits of music and music education which often reach to social justice dimensions or agendas as forms of legitimation or <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>privileging.</b> However can all models or approaches to music education be described as socially just and can all those that lay claim to a social justice agenda do so with equal legitimacy? We will argue that claims to further social justice agendas through particular approaches to music education need to be examined with healthy scepticism and interrogated in terms of the values, aims and pedagogical relationships that underpin them and following Bowman (2013) evaluated and valued in terms {{of the extent to which}} they contribute to ‘human thriving’ (4). Working from a definition of social justice for music education which includes both democratic and emancipatory indicators, we examine the social and cultural processes that have confounded social justice in music education in spite of significant policy and curriculum change over the last five decades. We conclude by arguing for an approach to music education which is concerned with the creation of dialogical spaces within which there is a ‘dynamic and continuous emergence...|$|R

500|$|In Branzburg v. Hayes (1972), the Court {{ruled that}} the First Amendment did not give a {{journalist}} the right to refuse a subpoena from a grand jury. The issue decided in the case was whether a journalist could refuse to [...] "appear and testify before state and Federal grand juries" [...] basing the refusal {{on the belief that}} such appearance and testimony [...] "abridges the freedom of speech and press guaranteed by the First Amendment". The 5–4 decision was that such a protection was not provided by the First Amendment. However, a concurring opinion by Justice Lewis F. Powell, in which he stated that a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> press <b>privilege</b> [...] "should be judged on its facts by the striking of a proper balance between freedom of the press and the obligation of all citizens to give relevant testimony with respect to criminal conduct.

5000|$|On July 19, 1882, the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors {{issued its}} {{decision}} {{in favor of}} Hall. Chief Justice John Park wrote for the Court and took the position, contrary to Collier’s argument, that if the legislature wanted to exclude women, it would have rewritten the statute to expressly exclude them. Park explained his opinion, stating, “We are not to forget that all statutes are to be construed, as far as possible, in favor of equality of rights. All restrictions upon human liberty, all <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> special <b>privileges,</b> are {{to be regarded as}} having the presumption of law against them, and as standing upon their defense, and can be sustained, if at all by valid legislation, only by the clear expression or clear implication of the law.” This decision had the effect of holding that the laws of equal protection applied to women because he in effect rejected the “entire jurisprudence of separate spheres.” It has been said that this decision as “one of the greatest decisions in all of Connecticut jurisprudence.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1900s, {{hundreds}} of thousands of Koreans migrated to Manchuria. Though this territory was not under Japanese control, the Japanese government claimed Koreans in Chinese territory as Japanese nationals.

It meant that Japanese consulates <b>claimed</b> extraterritoriality <b>privileges</b> <b>for</b> Koreans in China and that Koreans were prohibited from naturalizing as Chinese citizens.

40|$|Parliament in its {{exclusive}} cognizance can legislate {{for anything}} it sees fit. However this paper {{finds that the}} New Zealand Parliament had the opportunity in Attorney-General and Gow v Leigh to balance political needs and respect for individual rights rather than to adopt a reactionary attitude in enacting the Parliamentary Privilege Act 2014. It would be appropriate for Parliament to closely examine {{the efficacy of the}} “necessity test” in Leigh {{in the light of the}} implication of the codification of the definition of “proceedings in parliament” on the scope of parliamentary privilege as the experiences by the Australian jurisdictions showed. On the other hand, the court’s obligations under the Bill of Rights Act, 1990 might result in the Parliamentary Privilege Act 2014 being interpreted in ways that the lawmakers might not have intended. This paper examines the public/private dichotomy between the public interest justification for parliamentary immunity and the individual’s right to have access to remedy, in the context of the underpinning features of the “necessity” test that give precedence to basic individual rights. The test being; any <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> absolute <b>privilege</b> <b>for</b> an occasion that occurs outside absolutely privileged spheres (Parliament and its committees) that could result in depriving citizens of their basic rights, had to be necessary as in the sense of “essential” for the proper functioning of the core roles of the House. In conclusion, this paper finds that the contentious issues revolve around comity. It then attempts to address the interests of the three stakeholders in the Leigh decision; the individual citizen, the judiciary and the legislature by recommending a number of comity “best practice” reforms to the House’s Standing Orders and the Parliamentary Privilege Act 2014...|$|R
40|$|Historically, the {{perspective}} assumed {{in writing about}} the Pacific until 1970 presented Pacific peoples through European eyes in roles of spectators and objects of European desires. After {{the beginning of what}} Paul Sharrad called an “authentic” Pacific literature, {{the perspective}} shifted to one that viewed life through the eyes of Pacific peoples. For example, “Parade” by Patricia Grace can be read as a trope of the transforming power of the insider perspective. When the insider perspective is examined in postcolonial terms, it is clear that “there can hardly be such a thing as an essential inside that can be homogeneously represented by all insiders” (Minh-ha 1995, 218). The realities of contemporary writers from the Pacific illustrate the complications in <b>claiming</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>for</b> Pacific voices because they are native. New fiction from the Pacific during the 1990 s exhibits its postcolonial identity through the perspectives it adopts, through innovations in language use, and through its ability to transform traditional images of society and culture into images of postcoloniality...|$|R
40|$|Increasing threat {{intrusions}} to enterprise computing {{systems have}} led to a formulation of guarded enterprise systems.

Its distributed approach has no need for passwords or accounts and derives from a set of tenets that form the basic security model requirements. At each step in the process it determines identities and <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> access and <b>privileges.</b> These techniques are resilient, secure, extensible, and scalable. They are currently being implemented for a major enterprise, and are a candidate for other enterprise security approaches.

2500|$|The Fifth Amendment [...] (Amendment V) to the United States Constitution {{is part of}} the Bill of Rights {{and protects}} {{individuals}} from being compelled to be witnesses against themselves in criminal cases. [...] "Pleading the Fifth" [...] is a colloquial term for invoking the right that allows witnesses to decline to answer questions where the answers might incriminate them, and generally without having to suffer a penalty for asserting the right. This evidentiary privilege ensures that defendants cannot be compelled to become witnesses at their own trials. If, however, they choose to testify, they are not entitled to the right during cross-examination, where questions are relevant to their testimony on direct examination. The Amendment requires that felonies be tried only upon indictment by a grand jury. Federal grand juries can force people to take the witness stand, but defendants in those proceedings have Fifth Amendment privileges until they choose to answer any question. To <b>claim</b> the <b>privilege</b> <b>for</b> failure to answer when being interviewed by police, the interviewee must have explicitly invoked the constitutional right when declining to answer questions.|$|R
