5|$|Aetosaur remains {{have been}} found since the early 19th century, {{although}} the very first remains that were described were mistaken for fish scales. Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives, with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers.

There is also evidence that some if not all aetosaurs made nests.|$|E

5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} now <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether {{it could have}} reared up on its hind legs, using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage.

Mycenastraceae is not currently <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> independent taxonomic significance and is folded into synonymy with the Agaricaceae.|$|E
