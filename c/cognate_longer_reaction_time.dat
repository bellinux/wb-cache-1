40|$|Two psycholinguistic {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in Italian to test {{the role played by}} the feature that distinguishes mass nouns from count nouns, {{as well as by the}} feature that distinguishes singular nouns from plural nouns. The first experiment, a simple lexical decision task, revealed a sensitivity of the lexical ac- cess system to the processing of the features Mass and Plural as shown by <b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times.</b> In particular, nouns in the plural yielded <b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> than in the singular except when the plural form was irregular. Furthermore, the feature Mass also affected processing, yielding <b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times.</b> In the second experiment, a sentence priming task, both the Plural and the Mass effects did not surface when a grammatical sentence fragment was the prime. These data show a direct correlation between the linguistic ‘complexity’ of plural/mass nouns and processing time. They also suggest that this complexity does not affect normal fluent spoken language where words are embedded in a semantic and syntactic context...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the implications for night driving of a proposal put forward by a window tinting lobby group to reduce the required minimum visible light transmittance (VLT) of front side windows of cars from 70 % to 35 %. A sample of 24 young (aged under 30 years) and 24 elderly (aged 59 or over) subjects were required to complete target detection and <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> tasks using peripheral vision. These tasks were performed both through a clear or tinted front side window and both in the presence and absence of a concurrent visual tracking task performed on a computer screen {{directly in front of the}} subject. The contrast value of the targets to be detected also took two different values. It was found that the elderly performed worse on the task overall, producing 178 of the 179 target detection failures in the study and also registering <b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> than the young group. <b>Reaction</b> <b>times</b> recorded for the elderly group were also found to be longer when they were required to view the targets through the tinted window. Similar effects were found for the elderly resulting from the dual task manipulation (<b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> when performing the concurrent task) and from the target contrast manipulation (<b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> when reacting to the low contrast target). As this study was very conservative in nature, it is concluded on the basis of significantly <b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> for the elderly subjects when looking through the tinted window that industry pressure to lower the minimum VLT of front side windows should be resisted and that these windows should be required to allow 70 % of incident visual light to pass through to the eyes of the driver.

30|$|There is a {{limitation}} on {{what can be}} said in regard to acquisition because no statistical significant effects were found in regard to practice. Nevertheless, we did find some significant results to support that DS individuals with different levels of handicap will show different ways to structure their actions.

Considering the one-target advantage rationale, <b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> mean that moderate DS individual spent more time to select a plan of the elements of motor programming.

40|$|This study investigates on-line {{language}} processing in older adults. It is hypothesized that older adults show {{a decline in}} their processing resources that can be employed during {{language processing}}, resulting in differences between younger and older adults when their on-line sentence interpretation is tested. Such differences might be observed in sentences that exert a higher demand on processing resources for interpretation. Two on-line experiments are performed, examining <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> in a lexical decision task. In this task, varying interpretive demands are imposed by different pronoun and reflexive-antecedent relations (logophoric reflexive - antecedent relations vs. coargument reflexive - antecedent relations and bound variable pronoun - antecedent relations vs. referring pronoun - antecedent relations). Since the interpretation of logophoric reflexives and bound variable pronouns is assumed to cause a higher load on the processing system, these pronominal relations are expected to give rise to <b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> already in younger subjects, and to disproportionate <b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> in older adults. The {{results show that the}} <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> of the older adults are not significantly longer for the more demanding sentence types compared to the younger subjects. The hypothesis of an age related decline in language processing cannot be confirmed; the older adults are slower, but they are slower on all sentence types. This suggests an age related slow down in the execution of general cognitive tasks, not attributable to language processing per se. However, some results tend to suggest that the hypothesized age related decline is not observable in terms of <b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> for older adults, but in terms of a delayed syntactic processor in older adults. In that case, the effects of interpreting sentence types that impose a higher load to the system will be observable at some later point during sentence interpretation.

30|$|While {{transesterification}} of oils {{to produce}} biodiesel is a well-established method, there exist conversion and energy utilization inefficiencies {{in the process}} which result in {{the high cost of}} biodiesel. These are mainly associated with the heating method employed in the process. Transesterification of organic feedstock to yield biodiesel can be performed by the following methods: 1) conventional heating with acid, base catalysts and co-solvents [42 – 51]; 2) sub- and super-critical methanol conditions with co-solvents and without catalyst [52 – 57]; 3) enzymatic method using lipases [58 – 63]; and 4) microwave irradiation with acid, base and heterogeneous catalysts [64 – 67]. Among these methods, conventional heating method requires <b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> with higher energy inputs and losses to the ambient [66]. Super and sub-critical methanol process operates in expensive reactors at high temperatures and pressures resulting in higher energy inputs and higher production costs [53, 67 – 69]. The enzymatic method, though operates at much lower temperatures, requires much <b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> [40]. Microwave-assisted transesterification, on the other hand, is energy-efficient and quick process to produce biodiesel from different feedstocks [65, 66].|$|R

30|$|The {{practical}} achievable SA of 213 Bi with peptide is {{much lower}} than after labelling with 90 Y, 111 In or 177 Lu, due to the at least twice higher reaction volume with 213 Bi. The elution volume of the generator is fixed at approximately 600 μl, dependent on the generator bed volume in the preclinical setting using a 220 MBq 225 Ac generator. Generators containing higher amount of 225 Ac activity have larger bed volumes and higher elution volumes [4],[19]. High labelling volume or low concentration of the labelled compounds results in poor reaction kinetics of the labelling, which can be solved by increasing the temperature or taking a <b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time.</b> However, {{at a very high}} temperature, denaturation of biological materials might occur, {{and in the case of}} 213 Bi, a <b>longer</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> will result in decay of activity.
