In an incident on January 12, 2006 at Texas A University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>beam</b> immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2m off their foundations.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} {{difficult}} tasks {{during the course of}} the construction was a rock excavation work costing S$1.5 million along Woodlands Avenue 3, in which explosives were used to make way for the train viaduct. Another difficult project was the levelling of land covered in thick vegetation in Kadut, Woodlands and Sembawang. The laying of a 22-metre long <b>concrete</b> <b>beam</b> weighing 165 tonnes in October 1994 marked the completion of the structural link between the existing MRT network and the Woodlands extension line. The entire Woodlands extension line consists of around 1,163 beams. The tracks were then laid, followed by the installation of the electrical and mechanical systems and equipment. A real-time information system, costing S$400,000, was first introduced on the Woodlands MRT line. It provides passengers with train arrival times and informs them if trains are late or disrupted. The information is displayed on electronic boards installed at the entrance of each station.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the shear behaviour of prestressed beams made with high-workability concrete and normal concrete under static load. A total of 18 prestressed beam specimens were made in this study; nine were prestressed high-workability <b>concrete</b> <b>beams,</b> and the rest were normal <b>concrete</b> <b>beams.</b> The specimens were all 400 mm deep T-sections, tested with two concentrated loads. The test parameters included concrete strength, amount of prestress, shear span-to-depth ratio and spacing of transverse reinforcement. The results show that prestressed high-workability <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> have better structural behaviour than prestressed normal <b>concrete</b> <b>beams.</b> The diagonal cracking strengths and ultimate strengths of high-workability <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> were 1. 20 and 1. 17 times those of normal <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> respectively. Prestressed high-workability <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> have better crack control ability than prestressed normal <b>concrete</b> <b>beams.</b> With the same crack width, high-workability <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> can reach greater loads which are approximately 1. 21 times those of normal <b>concrete</b> <b>beams.</b> In addition, prestressed high-workability <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> have greater stiffness than prestressed normal <b>concrete</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R

The {{research}} conducts {{the numerical}} analysis of the fatigue performance of precracked <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> strengthened with prestressed CFRP, establishing the static analysis model (SM) and fatigue analysis model (FM) respectively, examining the change of the static loading and fatigue performance before and after CFRP strengthens precracked <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> in the different prestressed situations, and analyzing the relevant fatigue performance parameters through comparing FEM analysis with experimental results. The research results demonstrate that the method of strengthening <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> with prestressed CFRP can improve the static loading and fatigue performance; the increased rate of fatigue performance of precracked <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> {{is parallel to the}} CFRP prestress; the fatigue life of precracked <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> increases with the raising of the CFRP prestress; FEM analysis is in close agreement with experiment results; the fatigue properties of precracked <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> strengthened with prestressed CFRP can be analyzed effectively by the finite element method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Based on {{independent}} {{research and development}} of a CFRP tendons wedge-type anchorage, the shear tests of six CFRP external prestressing <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> were done. Among them, CFRP external tendons of three pieces were installed in straight line while other pieces were installed in curved line. The results of experimental research show that shear behaviour of <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> prestressed with CFRP external tendons are the similar process to the traditional prestressed reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>beams.</b> They go through the elastic stage, the stage of crack extension, the yield stage of internal hoop reinforcements at the intersection of inclined cracks and the failure stage. When external CFRP tendons are arranged in the same situation, the cracking load and the shear capacity of <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> prestressed with CFRP external tendons reduce gradually along with the increase of shear-span ratio,. When shear-span ratio is equal, the cracking load and the shear capacity of <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> prestressed with curved arrangement of CFRP external tendons are larger than those of <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> prestressed with straight arrangement of CFRP external tendons. Compared with traditional <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> prestressed with external steel bars, due to elasticity modulus and shear modulus of CFRP tendons are both smaller than those of steel bars, the mid-span deflection of <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> prestressed with CFRP external tendons at the time of shear failure is bigger than that of traditional <b>concrete</b> <b>beams</b> prestressed with external steel bars under the same circumstance. 1...|$|R
