40|$|Coniothyrium-like coelomycetes {{are drawing}} {{attention}} as biological control agents, potential bioremediators, and producers of antibiotics. Four genera are currently used to classify such anamorphs, namely, Coniothyrium, Microsphaeropsis, Cyclothyrium, and Cytoplea. The morphological plasticity of these fungi, however, {{makes it difficult}} to ascertain their best generic disposition in many cases. A new genus, Paraconiothyrium is here proposed to accommodate four new species, P. estuarinum, P. brasiliense, P. cyclothyrioides, and P. fungicola. Their formal descriptions are based on anamorphic characters as seen in vitro. The teleomorphs of these species are unknown, but maximum parsimony analysis of ITS and partial SSU nrDNA sequences showed that they belong in the Pleosporales and group in a clade including Paraphaeosphaeria s. str., the biocontrol agent <b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans,</b> and the ubiquitous soil fungus Coniothyrium sporulosum. <b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans</b> and C. sporulosum are therefore also combined into the genus Paraconiothyrium.

40|$|Integrated {{control of}} soil-borne plant {{pathogens}} such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum {{is becoming more}} important as the soil fumigant methyl bromide is being phased out of use. Two alternative methods of control {{that have been found}} to reduce viability of sclerotia are steam sterilisation (pasteurisation) of soil or the application of the mycoparasite <b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans.</b> This work investigated the possibility of integrating these two control measures. Soil was pasteurised in an autoclave, using a temperature of 80 degrees C for 3 min to simulate the possible temperatures reached by soil steaming machines for field use. <b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans</b> was subsequently applied to the pasteurised soil to assess the effects of the combination of control measures in reducing sclerotial viability of S. sclerotiorum. Similar results were found in two soil types. Either method used individually was effective in decreasing the number of viable sclerotia, but no further reduction in sclerotial viability was seen when the two methods were combined. <b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans</b> was found to colonise pasteurised sclerotia significantly quicker than untreated sclerotia, and it was seen that there was an increase in number of C. minitans in pasteurised soil in the presence of sclerotia. Experiments were also conducted to investigate the effect of application timing of the biocontrol agent to soil following pasteurisation, in relation to sclerotial infection. Here, two different isolates of S. sclerotiorum were used, with similar results. Application of C. minitans to soil immediately following pasteurisation resulted in sclerotial infection by the mycoparasite, but application 7 days or more after soil pasteurisation resulted in low recovery of the biocontrol agent from sclerotia, possibly due to the mycoparasite being masked by the presence of other fungi which colonised the sclerotia first...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} inocula of the mycoparasite <b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans</b> on carpogenic germination of sclerotia of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum {{at different times}} of year were assessed. A series of three glasshouse box bioassays was used to compare the effect of five spore-suspension inocula of C. minitans, including three different isolates (Conio, IVT 1 and Contans), with a standard maizemeal–perlite inoculum. Apothecial production, as well as viability and C. minitans infection of S. sclerotiorum sclerotia buried in treated soil, were assessed. Maizemeal–perlite inoculum at 107 CFU per cm 3 soil reduced sclerotial germination and apothecial production in all three box bioassays, decreasing sclerotial recovery and viability in the second bioassay and increasing C. minitans infection of sclerotia in the first bioassay. Spore-suspension inocula applied at a lower concentration (104 CFU per cm 3 soil) were inconsistent in their effects on sclerotial germination in the three box bioassays. Temperature was an important factor influencing apothecial production. Sclerotial germination was delayed or inhibited when bioassays were made in the summer. High temperatures also inhibited infection of sclerotia by C. minitans. <b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans</b> survived these high temperatures, however, and infected the sclerotia once the temperature decreased to a lower level.

40|$|<b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans</b> colonises and {{destroys the}} {{sclerotia}} of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in nature exhibiting ecologically obligate mycoparasitism as its spores remain dormant in soil and only grow actively {{in the presence}} of the sclerotia. Molecular mechanisms underlying sclerotial mycoparasitism are poorly defined. We identified 251 unisequences representing genes preferentially expressed by C millitalls during sclerotial mycoparasitism, substantially increasing the molecular knowledge of this commercially important biocontrol agent. Genes associated with signalling and cellular communication, degradation of host cell walls and energy reserves, nutrient utilisation, detoxification and stress response were identified suggesting that C minitans employs a number of key processes during host colonisation. Several of these genes are novel to fungal-fungal interactions (e. g. PTH 11 -like GPCR and the ETP gene cluster). Secretin receptor-like GPCR and the TGF-beta signalling system have not yet been characterised in filamentous fungi.

40|$|Abstract. To study {{possible}} biocontrol agents against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum on {{potato plants}} in Hamadan, Iran, {{a sampling of}} sclerotia was conducted in potato fields, and after culturing one of these sclerotia on potato dextrose agar, a coelomycetous fungus was observed.

Using scanning electron microscopy, developing pycnidia were first seen within the sclerotial medulla at 7 days post-inoculation with the mycoparasite in pasteurised soil. However, by 14 days post-inoculation, pycnidia had developed fully in both pasteurised and non-pasteurised treatments, and conidial droplets were exuded onto the outer surface of the infected sclerotia. Thirty days post-inoculation, irrespective of soil treatment, {{the majority of the}} sclerotial medulla had been converted to pycnidia, with the sclerotial rind remaining largely intact. The pycnidia and dried intact droplets were still observed 6 months post-inoculation with C. minitans, although the conidia on the outer surface of the dried droplets had largely collapsed by this stage. Germinability studies at 10 months post-inoculation showed that approximately 13 % of the conidia in dried droplets were still viable.

In contrast, cell surface electrostatic charge decreased uniformly in conidia of all five isolates for the first 34 d and then rose slightly at 42 d. The variation in cell surface electrostatic charge (spectrum width) of the sampled conidia decreased with age for all five isolates.

40|$|Aims: To {{characterize}} {{the interaction of}} Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and S. minor with strains of the mycoparasite and commercial biocontrol agent <b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans</b> using novel perfusion chamber gasket co-culture. Methods and Results: Sclerotinia were cultured in perfusion chamber gaskets and then flooded with Coniothyrium conidia. After germination, Coniothyrium failed to show any form of directed growth, making contact with Sclerotinia hyphae in a random manner. In turn, some Coniothyrium hyphae coiled round Sclerotinia counterparts and although no intracellular growth was observed, Coniothyrium proliferated, while the hyphae of Sclerotinia became vacuolated and lost the cytoplasm. When co-cultures of Sclerotinia with Coniothyrium were flooded with FITC-lectins, small difference in fluorescence between the fungi was found with FITC-Con A suggesting that cell walls of both the species exposed mannose. In contrast, Coniothyrium fluoresced poorly in comparison with Sclerotinia when FITC-wheat germ agglutinin was used, indicating a marked paucity of N-acetylglucosamine exposure by cell walls of Coniothyrium, hence reduced exposure to chitinolytic enzyme action. Conclusions, Significance and Impact of the Study: The approach employed supported direct sequential microscopic observation of Coniothyrium and Sclerotinia {{as well as the}} utilization of representative fluorescent moieties to characterize relative carbohydrate cell wall exposure. ...|$|E

There were almost no differences between media for the estimates of yield coefficients and maintenance coefficients. Only at high urea concentrations were maintenance coefficients much higher. Similar to substrate consumption and CO 2 production, the kinetics of sporulation could be described as a function of mycelium production with the linear-growth model.

Activity was found against some ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, oomycetes and Gram-positive bacteria, but not against zygomycetes, yeasts or Gram-negative bacteria tested. Six C. minitans isolates (Conio, Contans, IVT 1, CM/AP/ 3118, B 279 / 1, Al/ 327 / 1) were found to produce macrosphelide A in liquid culture and no other antibiotics were detected. On agar, macrosphelide A inhibited growth of some ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, oomycetes and all four Gram-positive bacteria tested, including the medically important Staphylococcus aureus with a minimum inhibitory concentration of <= 500 mu g ml(- 1). There was no inhibition observed against the yeasts and Gram-negative bacteria when macrosphelide A was tested at 700 mu g ml(- 1). Conclusions: The spectrum and level of activity of macrosphelide A produced by C. minitans against micro-organisms are extended markedly compared to previous reports.

Experiments have mainly been carried out with Contans® WG, a ready-for-use formulation of C. minitans. Firstly effectiveness of C. minitans against sclerotia of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was demonstrated. Then, its use on oilseed rape crops has been studied for several years in large size experimental plots. When it is incorporated into soil, C. minitans reduced the soil infestation by destroying sclerotia. By decreasing the soil infestation, C. minitans also reduced the primary inoculum pressure. Thus it allowed to reduce the sclerotinia risk and the disease incidence. The results are discussed according to the decision support system CETIOM in progress. Thus, a reduction of sclerotinia risk underneath a decision threshold in treated field plots could prevent any further spray of fungicides.

The nature of yeast cell recognition, mediated by an acanthamoebal trophozoite mannose binding protein is confirmed by experiments utilizing concentration dependent mannose hapten blocking. Similarly, acapsulate cells of Cryptococcus neoformans are also bound within a relatively short timescale. However, even after protracted incubation many capsulate cells of Cryptococcus remain in suspension, suggesting that the capsulate cell form of this species is not predated by acanthamoebal trophozoites. Further aspects {{of the association of}} Acanthamoeba and fungi are apparent when studying their interaction with conidia of the biocontrol agent <b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans.</b> Conidia which readily bind with increasing maturity of up to 42 days, were little endocytosed and even released. Cell and conidial surface mannose as determined by FITC-lectin binding, flow cytometry with associated ligand binding analysis and hapten blocking studies demonstrates the following phenomena. Candida isolates and acapsulate Cryptococcus expose most mannose, while capsulate Cryptococcus cells exhibit least exposure commensurate with yeast cellular binding or lack of trophozoites. Conidia of Coniothyrium, albeit in a localized fashion, also manifest surface mannose exposure but as shown by Bmax values, in decreasing amounts with increasing maturity. Contrastingly such conidia experience greater trophozoite binding with maturation, thereby questioning the primacy of a trophozoite mannose-binding-protein recognition model. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans</b> is an {{important}} mycoparasite of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. In addition, it also produces small amounts of antifungal substances. ZS- 1 TN 1812, an abnormal mutant, was originally screened from a T-DNA insertional library. This mutant showed abnormal growth phenotype and could significantly inhibit the growth of S. sclerotiorum when dual-cultured on a PDA plate. When spraying the filtrate of ZS- 1 TN 1812 on the leaves of rapeseed, S. sclerotiorum infection was significantly inhibited, suggesting that the antifungal substances produced by this mutant were effective on rapeseed leaves. The thermo-tolerant antifungal substances could specifically suppress the growth of S. sclerotiorum, but could not significantly suppress the growth of another fungus, Colletotrichum higginsianum. However, C. higginsianum was more sensitive to proteinous antibiotics than S. sclerotiorum. The T-DNA insertion in ZS- 1 TN 1812 activated the expression of CmSIT 1, a gene involved in siderophore-mediated iron transport. It was also determined that mutant ZS- 1 TN 1812 produced hypha with high iron levels. In the wild-type strain ZS- 1, CmSIT 1 was expressed only when in contact with S. sclerotiorum, and consistent overexpression of CmSIT 1 showed similar phenotypes as ZS- 1 TN 1812.

However, two applications of Contans, one at planting and one at post-thinning, significantly reduced the incidence of lettuce drop caused by S. sclerotiorum and increased yield but had no effect on S. minor at both locations in both years. Two applications of other biocontrol products did not significantly reduce disease incidence despite medium to high recovery following application. In contrast, Contans was only sporadically recovered following application. In vitro fungicide sensitivity evaluation revealed that both Trichoderma and Gliocladium species were tolerant to iprodione, dicloran (Botran), and vinclozolin (Ronilan) up to 1, 000 ppm a. i., whereas both Sclerotinia spp. and C. minitans were sensitive to all three fungicides above 1 ppm. In summary, Contans was the most effective treatment for the control of lettuce drop caused by S. sclerotiorum, but no treatment was effective against S. minor in the desert lettuce production systems...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{signaling}} pathways that modulate conidiation of mitosporic fungi is of both {{practical and}} theoretical importance. The enzymatic origin of nitric oxide (NO) and its roles in conidiation by the sclerotial parasite <b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans</b> were investigated. The activity of a nitric oxide synthase-like (NOS-like) enzyme was detected in C. minitans {{as evidenced by}} the conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline. Guanylate cyclase (GC) activity was also detected indirectly in C. minitans with the GC-specific inhibitor 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ), which significantly reduced production of cyclic GMP (cGMP). The dynamics of NOS activity were closely mirrored by the cGMP levels during pycnidial development, with the highest levels of both occurring at the pycnidial initiation stage of C. minitans. Furthermore, the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), stimulated the accumulation of cGMP almost instantly in mycelium during the hyphal growth stage. When the activity of NOS or GC was inhibited with Nω-nitro-l-arginine or ODQ, conidial production of C. minitans was suppressed or completely eliminated; however, the suppression of conidiation by ODQ could be reversed by exogenous cGMP. The results also showed that conidiation of an l-arginine auxotroph could be restored by the NO donor SNP, but not by cGMP. Thus, NO-mediated conidiation has more than one signal pathway, including the cGMP signal pathway and another yet-unknown pathway, and both are essential for conidiation in C. minitans...|$|E
40|$|Wisconsin Fast Plants® (WFP) are a rapid-cycling {{species of}} Brassica rapa {{and members of}} the Brassicaceae family. Fast Plants serve as an {{important}} research tool for improving disease resistance and are an ideal model organism to utilize in science teaching and learning. Two disease systems known to impact New York growers were investigated. Black rot disease is caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), a bacterial pathogen that is generally considered the most significant disease of brassica crops. The pathogen can spread through infested seeds and transplants or plant-to-plant from insect wounds or water droplets. As completely pathogen-free planting material can be hard to obtain, hot water treatment of seeds can help. This will greatly reduce, but not always eliminate, bacteria in or on the seeds, and it may reduce seed viability and seedling vigor. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a fungus that causes white mold disease of hundreds of plant species, including WFP. White mold is a soil-borne disease that can develop into a serious and persistent problem when it becomes established in a field. Strains of <b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans</b> {{can be used as a}} parasitic bio-fungicide against S. sclerotiorum. Objectives for this research included: establishment of methodology for creating disease in the laboratory setting on WFP using black rot and white mold, development of a lab activity investigating seed transmission and control of black rot disease, development of a lab activity exploring the use of biological controls of white mold...|$|E
40|$|White mould, {{caused by}} Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, {{is a serious}} disease {{affecting}} {{a wide range of}} agricultural and horticultural crops. Biological control is one option available to limit its damage. Field experiments to evaluate various concentrations and volumes of <b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans</b> spore suspensions applied to S. sclerotiorum-infected bean crops were conducted in 1997 and 1998. Percentage sclerotia infected by C. minitans were scored. Three replicate experiments were performed in time in 1997 with 21 combinations of isolates, volumes and concentrations, including two controls. In 1998, 22 combinations of isolates, volumes and concentrations plus two controls were used, combined with the absence or presence of a maize buffer, with two replicates for each. Isolates as well as concentration and volume had no effect on infection by C. minitans, but there was a significant effect of total dose (volumeconcentration) of inoculum applied over the full range from 100 L ha- 1 at 104 conidia mL- 1 to 1000 L ha- 1 at 107 conidia mL- 1. Percentage infected sclerotia increased linearly with log (dose) as well as from 1 to 4 weeks after application of C. minitans, and reached a level of about 100 % at high doses under the humid conditions of 1998. Apothecia of S. sclerotiorum developing from sclerotia in collected soil samples from the 1997 experiment showed no significant effect of C. minitans inoculum dose, but there was a significant effect of the replicate experiments. The influence of weather conditions is highlighted, and the implications of the results for cost-effective biocontrol of S. sclerotiorum are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Clover rot (caused by Sclerotinia trifoliorum) and its {{influence}} on the persistence of red clover (Trifolium pratense) was studied in this thesis. Twenty-one red clover cultivars, of various types, were examined in both field and controlled environment experiments. Field experiments were performed at six sites in different climatic regions. The prevalence of root rot, caused by a broad soil-inhabiting group of secondary invading fungi, including Fusarium spp, was also studied. Both diseases {{were found to be}} prevalent throughout the country and disease severity was unaffected by latitude. The late flowering clover cultivars grown in southern Sweden exhibited lower levels of mortality due to clover rot than the earlier heading cultivars. In addition, lower root rot disease indices were recorded for the late flowering cultivars. Tetraploid cultivars grown in northern Sweden exhibited lower levels of mortality due to clover rot than diploid ones. This pattern was not found in southern Sweden or in the controlled environment experiments, where conditions were optimised for clover rot infection. In contrast, tetraploid ones had greater root rot disease indices than diploid cultivars in most cases. Studies of more than 250 Sclerotinia trifoliorum isolates revealed a high level of genetic variation. In laboratory tests, twenty of the isolates exhibited different capacities to cause disease. Fungal strains from northern Sweden generally caused more plant death, but aggressive strains were also found in southern Sweden. The fungus <b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans</b> was shown to control clover rot infection in cultivar SW Torun at a northern site with heavy natural soil infestation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans</b> was {{successfully}} co-transformed with the uidA (b-glucuronidase) and the hygromycin-resistance (hph) genes. Both {{were under the}} control of the glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate promoter from Aspergillus nidulans. Hygromycin resistance was used as a selectable marker for transformation. In successive transformation experiments, transformation frequencies of up to 1000 transformants lg− " of plasmid DNA were obtained for isolate A 69. Of the ten monospore hygromycin-resistant cultures tested, nine also expressed the uidA gene. Expression of hph and uidA was stable in all transformants after several months of successive subculturing on non-selective medium, and after passage through a sclerotium of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Southern hybridization analyses showed all transformants carried multiple copies of each marker gene. When grown on PDA, the culture morphology of three of the transformants of (T‹ 2, T‹ 3 and T‹ 4) was similar to the wild type. Four of the five transformants (T‹ 3, T‹ 4, T‹ 21 and T‹ 24) grew as well as the wild type on different media, and responded to changes in water potential in a similar manner to the wild type. All five transformants were equally parasitic on sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum compared with the wild type. Transformants T‹ 3 and T‹ 4 were the most similar to the wild type in biological characteristics and will be used in future studies. The results indicate that hph- and uidA-transformed strains of C. minitans will be useful for ecological studies on its survival and dissemination.

40|$|During sclerotial {{infection}} of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum the mycoparasite <b>Coniothyrium</b> <b>minitans</b> penetrates through the host cell wall, which contains β- 1, 3 -glucan as its major component. A PCR-based strategy {{was used to}} clone a β- 1, 3 -glucanase-encoding gene, designated cmg 1, from a cDNA library of the fungus. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of this gene showed high levels of similarity to the sequences of other fungal exo-β- 1, 3 -glucanase genes. The calculated molecular mass of the deduced protein (without the predicted 24 -amino-acid N-terminal secretion signal peptide) was 83, 346 Da, and the estimated pI was 4. 73. Saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSc 1 expressing the cmg 1 gene secreted a ∼ 100 -kDa β- 1, 3 -glucanase enzyme (as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) into the culture medium. N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified recombinant enzyme revealed that the secreted enzyme starts at Ala- 32, seven amino acids downstream from the predicted signal peptidase cleavage site. The purified recombinant glucanase inhibited in vitro mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum by 35 and 85 % at concentrations of 300 and 600 μg ml− 1, respectively. A single copy of the cmg 1 gene {{is present in the}} genome of C. minitans. Northern analyses indicated increases in the transcript levels of cmg 1 due to both carbon starvation and the presence of ground sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum; only slight repression was observed in the presence of 2 % glucose. Expression of cmg 1 increased during parasitic interaction with S. sclerotiorum...|$|E
