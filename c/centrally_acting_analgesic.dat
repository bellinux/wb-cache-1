40|$|To summarise, it can {{be stated}} that many psychotropic {{substances}} or drugs {{were used in the}} field of dentistry in East Germany (GDR). During the 1950 s the most commonly used psychotropic drugs used in dentistry in the GDR were herbal medizines, bromides, and bromid-urea derivatives, methyl pentinol Pentinol®), aconitine, caffeine, codeine, reserpine, numerous barbituric acid derivatives Lepinal® and Kalypnon®, the guaiacol glycerine ether Neuroton®, the benactyzine product Procalm®, the hydantoin derivatives Phenytoin AWD and Lepitoin® and in particular, the phenothiazine derivatives Propaphenin® (chlorpromazine) and Prothazin® (promethazine). The <b>centrally</b> <b>acting</b> <b>analgesics</b> Dolcontral® (pethidine) and Morphinum hydrochloricum AWD were used on in-patients, rarely on out-patients. The primary fields of indication in which psychotropic substances were administered were premedication, anxiolysis, postmedication, pain therapy, trigeminal neuralgia therapy, prophylaxis and treatment of incidents, as well as some forms of craniomandibular dysfunction. In the 1950 s premedication and anxiolysis did not yet enjoy the status they do today. In the 1960 s the first minor tranquilizers manufactured in the GDR – Meprobamat (1961) as well as the benzodiazepine derivatives Timosin® (chlordiazepoxide 1967), Faustan® (diazepam 1968) and Radedorm® (nitrazepam 1969) – came onto the pharmaceuticals market and were successfully applied for their respective purposes in nearly all fields of indication in dentistry. The minor tranquilizer Radepur® (previously Timosin®) and, in particular, Faustan® proved to be the treatment of choice in the spheres of premedication, anxiolysis, prophylaxis and treatment of incidents. In the early 1970 s the minor tranquilizer Rudotel® (medazepam 1973) and the antiepileptic agent Finlepsin® (carbamazepine 1974) came onto the pharmaceuticals market in the GDR. The non-cardioselective beta-blocker Obsidan® (propranolol 1969) and the cardioselective beta-blocker Cordanum® (talinolol 1976) displayed excellent effectiveness, especially in the premedication, anxiolysis, prophylaxis and treatment of certain cardiovascular diseases, but they did not succeed in becoming permanently established in the sphere of anxiolysis and premedication in dentistry. In the 1980 s there were not outstanding developments and changes as regards the application of psychotropic substances in dentistry. The broadest range of applications was that of the group of minor tranquilizers from the benzodiazepine class of drugs. All neuropsychotropic drugs in the GDR were available only on prescription.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the correlation between polypharmacy and depressive symptoms in hospitalized adults aged over 65 years. Patients and methods: We obtained medical history and current treatment data from clinical records. We used the Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS) to exclude patients with dementia. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used assess depressive symptoms. Pearson and Spearman coefficients were used to determine the relationship between variables. Results: A total of 206 individuals were included. The average number of medications taken by the individuals was 6. 9 ± 2. 7 and the average GDS score was 4. 9 ± 3. 4 points. Depressive symptoms (GDS score > 5 points) were observed in 68 (33. 0 %) individuals. GDS score positively correlated with the number of medications used (R = 0. 74; P = 0. 0001), the number of chronic conditions (R = 0. 78; P = 0. 001), and pain complaints (Z = 7. 94; P = 0. 0001).

40|$|AbstractThe {{reported}} {{experimental study}} was conducted to compare the effects of repeated daily oral doses of curcuminoids (CLE) with metformin as potential antidepressants and analgesics. Effects of a single and ten daily oral doses of CLE (5, 20, 80  mg/kg/day) and of 50  mg/kg/day metformin (MET) were compared in mice hot plate test (HPT) for analgesics. On the 11 th treatment day, all animals were subjected to foot shock stress triggered hyperthermia test, and on the 12 th treatment day to tail suspension test (TST) for antidepressants. Immediately thereafter, their blood levels of glucose, insulin and cortisol were quantified. Dose dependent analgesic activity of CLE was observed in HPT, whereas the metformin dose tested suppressed only pain hypersensitivity in the test. But statistically significant effects of both of them were observed in TST, and both of them also afforded protections against body weight loss and slight elevation in core temperatures induced by daily handling and repeated testing. CLE or metformin had no significant effects in foot shock stress triggered transient hyperthermic responses or on blood glucose, insulin and cortisol levels. Reported results reveal that curcuminoids as well as metformin are stress response modifiers with antidepressants like activities, but only low dose curcuminoids possess <b>centrally</b> <b>acting</b> <b>analgesics</b> like activities. They suggest that the bio-assay system used in this study is well suited for identifying curcuminoids like plant metabolites with analgesic and anti-stress activities, and that low dose curcuminoids are more effective as analgesics than low dose metformin...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Acute {{and chronic}} pain {{is a common}} {{presenting}} sign in animal species and human beings. Approach: Classical opioids provide very effective pain relief, although they may be less effective {{in the treatment of}} chronic pain due to their limited therapeutic windows and the induced opioid receptor down regulation. Atypical opioids, such as tramadol and tapentadol, have a dual mechanism of action and have been designed to overcome these issues through an opiate-sparing effect. Results: Tramadol activates mu opioid receptors and in addition, inhibits serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake. These actions are the result of the different enantiomers and tend to be reliant on their metabolism. Indeed, the O-desmethyltramadol phase I metabolite, is 200 - 300 times more potent for mu opioid receptor activation than the parental compound. For these reasons, the drug’s effectiveness can vary among subjects. In veterinary medicine its effectiveness, especially after oral administration, is still uncertain and controversial. Tapentadol is a novel, atypical opioid with a unique mechanism of action. It was launched on the European drug market at the end of 2011. It has been proposed as the first representative of a new pharmacological class of <b>centrally</b> <b>acting</b> <b>analgesics,</b> namely, the mu opioid receptor agonist, noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors. The first human studies describe this molecule as safe and effective (equianalgesic to morphine). The drug has great potential for veterinary use because it exists as a single enantiomer only, it does not require metabolic activation to be effective and adverse effects triggered by the serotonin reuptake inhibition action are negligible. Recommendations: For these reasons, TAP is a promising compound however at this stage, more investigation is required before it can be recommended for regular use in veterinary medicine, the possibility of undesirable effects is yet to be entirely excluded...|$|R

We hypothesized that heightened pain in hand OA could be reduced with duloxetine or pregabalin. In this prospective, randomized clinical study, we recruited 65 participants, aged 40 – 75  years, with a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain of at least 5. Participants were randomized {{to one of the}} following three groups: duloxetine, pregabalin, and placebo. The primary endpoint was the NRS pain score, and the secondary endpoints included the Australian and Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index (AUSCAN) pain, stiffness, and function scores and quantitative sensory testing by pain pressure algometry. After 13 weeks, compared to placebo, ANOVA found significant differences between the three groups (P= 0. 0078). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the pregabalin group showed improvement for NRS pain (P= 0. 023), AUSCAN pain (P= 0. 008), and AUSCAN function (P= 0. 009), but no difference between duloxetine and placebo (P> 0. 05) was observed.

Sodium bicarbonate was incorporated as a gas-generating agent. Combination of polymers Xanthan gum and Locust bean gum was used to achieve controlled release effect. The concentration of polymers was considered as the independent variables and dependent variables were floating lag time and swelling index of the tablets. From the factorial batches, it was observed that formulation containing combination of 20 % sodium bicarbonate and 10 % citric acid shows optimum floating ability whereas the formulation containing 20 % Xanthan gum and 28 % Locust bean gum shows optimum sustained drug release pattern with adequate floating...|$|E
40|$|Tramadol is a <b>centrally</b> <b>acting</b> {{synthetic}} opioid <b>analgesic</b> used {{similarly to}} codeine, to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. The drug {{has a wide}} range of applications, including treatment for Rheumatoid arthritis, restless legs syndrome and fibromyalgia. Tramadol possesses weak agonist actions at the μ-opioid receptor, releases serotonin, and inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine. Opioids are chemical compounds which act upon {{one or more of the}} human opiate receptors. The opioid agonistic effect of tramadol and its major metabolite(s) are almost exclusively mediated by the substance's action at the μ-opioid receptor. This characteristic distinguishes tramadol from many other substances (including morphine) of the opioid drug class, which generally do not possess tramadol's degree of subtype selectivity...|$|R
40|$|Nefopam is a <b>centrally</b> <b>acting</b> non-opioid <b>{{analgesic}}</b> agent. Its analgesic properties may {{be related}} to the inhibitions of monoamine reuptake and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The antinociceptive effect of nefopam has been shown in animal models of acute and chronic pain and in humans. However, the effect of nefopam on diabetic neuropathic pain is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the preventive effect of nefopam on diabetic neuropathic pain induced by streptozotocin (STZ) in rats. Methods: Pretreatment with nefopam (30 mg/kg) was performed intraperitoneally 30 min prior to an intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg/kg). Mechanical and cold allodynia were tested before, and 1 to 4 weeks after drug administration. Thermal hyperalgesia was also investigated. In addition, the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA 1) and TRP melastatin 8 (TRPM 8) expression levels in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) were evaluated. Results: Pretreatment with nefopam significantly inhibited STZ-induced mechanical and cold allodynia, but not thermal hyperalgesia. The STZ injection increased TRPM 8, but not TRPA 1, expression levels in DRG neurons. Pretreatment with nefopam decreased STZ-induced TRPM 8 expression levels in the DRG. Conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: An {{efficient}} {{technique has}} been developed for microwave assisted synthesis of 1 -[5 -(substituted aryl) - 1 H-pyrazol- 3 -yl]- 3, 5 -diphenyl- 1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazole as antinociceptive and antimicrobial agents. Methods: The desired compounds (S 1 -S 10) were synthesized by the microwave irradiation via cyclization of formerly synthesized chalcones of 3, 5 -diphenyl- 1 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazole and hydrazine hydrate in mild acidic condition. All newly synthesized compounds were subjected to study their antinociceptive and antimicrobial activity. The analgesic potential of compounds was tested by acetic acid induced writhing response and hot plate method. The MIC values for antimicrobial activity were premeditated by liquid broth method. Results: The compounds S 1, S 2, S 4, S 6 and S 10 {{were found to be}} excellent peripherally <b>acting</b> <b>analgesic</b> agents when tested on mice by acetic acid induced writhing method and compounds S 3, S 6 and S 1 at dose level of 100 mg/kg were exhibited superior <b>centrally</b> <b>acting</b> antinociceptive activity when tested by Eddy’s hot plate method. In antimicrobial activity compound S 10 found to be broad spectrum antibacterial agent at MIC value of 15. 62 μg/ml and compound S 6 was exhibited antifungal potential at 15. 62 μg/mL on both fungal strains. Conclusion: Some novel pyrazoles clubbed with 1, 2, 4 -triazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as possible antimicrobial, <b>centrally</b> and peripherally <b>acting</b> <b>analgesics...</b>|$|R
