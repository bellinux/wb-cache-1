5|$|Cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause {{important}} {{diseases in}} humans and their livestock, and monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The <b>Carter</b> <b>Center</b> estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin. The people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E
5|$|In August 1990 the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) {{despatched}} {{a peacekeeping}} force, ECOMOG, to Liberia. The force {{arrived at the}} Freeport of Monrovia on August 24, 1990, landing from Nigerian and Ghanaian vessels. By the time ECOMOG arrived, Prince Johnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL were fighting on the outside bounds of the port. A series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June–October 1991. The first seven peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes and the <b>Carter</b> <b>Center</b> negotiation leading to the Cotonou Accords, failed {{due to lack of}} agreement between the warring factions. The NPFL launched an assault on Monrovia in 1992, which they named 'Operation Octopus.' The civil war lasted until the Abuja Accords of August 1996.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, the Chinese {{government}} began direct village elections {{to help maintain}} social and political order whilst facing rapid economic change. Elections now occur in about 650,000 villages across China, reaching 75% of the nation's 1.3billion people, according to the <b>Carter</b> <b>Center.</b> In 2008, Shenzhen, which enjoys the highest per capita GDP in China, was selected for experimentation, and over 70% of the government officials on the district level are to be directly elected (as of 2008). However, in keeping with Communist Party philosophy, candidates must be selected from a pre-approved list.|$|E
40|$|Democracy {{development}} {{techniques such}} as international election monitoring have increasingly become commonplace. Monitors are sent to far off locations to scrutinize the electoral processes and {{determine whether or not}} they have met the free and fair standards as established by their mandates. The term free and fair however, has become a catchphrase amongst many of those involved in the election monitoring and democracy development fields. The phrase is often interpreted loosely and is rarely clearly defined. Despite the recognition of the term’s often differing interpretations, it remains a commonly used standard. The 2005 Ethiopian Elections demonstrate that free and fair, when interpreted differently by international electoral observers, can have consequential results. The thesis provides a political analysis of the <b>Carter</b> <b>Center’s</b> and European Union’s international election monitoring final reports of the 2005 Ethiopian elections. Following the 2005 Ethiopian elections the <b>Carter</b> <b>Center’s</b> and the European Union’s electoral observation reports became highly politicized. In the post election period, the two organizations came to different conclusions in regards to the validity of the electoral process. At the core of these differences were the organizations’ differing conceptions of what constitutes free and fair electoral practices. In the post election period the European Union’s and <b>Carter</b> <b>Center’s</b> reports have been pitted against one and other as those concerned with the election results seek {{to make sense of the}} reports. This thesis is significant because it asks relevant questions about the consequences of differing understandings of free and fair. The thesis seeks to provide insight into international election monitoring and provide recommendations to improve the process...|$|R

25|$|From 1986 to 2009, Borlaug was the President of the SAA. That year, a {{joint venture}} between The <b>Carter</b> <b>Center</b> and SAA was {{launched}} called Sasakawa-Global 2000 (SG 2000). The program focuses on food, population and agricultural policy. Since then, more than 8 million small-scale farmers in 15 African countries have been trained in SAA farming techniques, which have helped them to double or triple grain production. Those elements that allowed Borlaug's projects to succeed in India and Pakistan, such as well-organized economies and transportation and irrigation systems, are severely lacking throughout Africa, posing additional obstacles to increasing yields. Because of this, Borlaug's initial projects were restricted to developed regions of the continent.|$|E
