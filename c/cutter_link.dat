50|$|Some chains {{also have}} guard links {{in front of}} each <b>cutter</b> <b>link.</b> The guard link reduces the {{tendency}} of {{the leading edge of the}} depth gauge to snag on small-diameter objects such as small branches, or to engage with ordinary timber if forced into contact with it.|$|E
5000|$|Saw chains operate {{by being}} {{propelled}} around a guide bar, removing {{material from the}} [...] by cutting chips from the side and bottom. In order to operate properly, the depth to which each tooth cuts must be limited to avoid it binding in the wood. Scratcher chain, like the teeth on a hand saw, simply uses a multitude of teeth to prevent individual teeth from sinking too far in without undue pressure on the bar. Chipper chain, and all subsequent designs, incorporate a depth gauge (also known as a [...] "raker") on each <b>cutter</b> <b>link</b> to limit depth of cut on each tooth. This has two distinct advantages over scratcher chain - it {{enables the use of}} fewer cutters per unit length of chain, which allows for shorter downtime for sharpening, and produces a more [...] "open" [...] chain layout, allowing far better clearance of chips and debris from the kerf. Individual depth gauges on each tooth also enable the use of skip chain. Skip or semi-skip chain has a further {{reduction in the number of}} teeth and is used for applications where much debris is produced, such as ripping or cross-cutting very large sections of wood. Skip chain also absorbs less power from the motor per unit length of chain than full-complement chain, allowing the use of a longer bar/chain combination on any given motor.|$|E

It has 1/3 fewer {{cutting teeth}} and is {{generally}} used on long bars (24"+) for added chip clearance {{or when a}} bar longer than ideal for a given power head is used.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this thesis has been to develop a {{calculation}} module {{for use in the}} simulation software Adams. The calculation module is based on equations found in the literature. A disc cutter is the tool in contact with the mount for example in tunnel boring machines. A disc cutter is a circular disc, made of high strength steel. A literary study was made where equations determining the forces acting on the disc cutter were found. The equations used in the module are based on the disc cutterâ€™s penetration into the rock, the spacing between two cuts and the rock properties, such as the compressive and Brazilian tensile strength. The simulation module was made and used in the simulation software Adams where the forces and moments acting on the disc cutter while cutting rock can be simulated. The advantage of the simulation model is that it is built {{in such a way that}} many disc <b>cutters</b> can be <b>linked</b> together and the forces from each of them can work together. A test was made on the simulation model and compared to a real test from the literature, made in a Linear Cutting Machine, and the theoretical calculated force from the model for the given rock penetration and spacing between the two cuts. The simulation model showed a clear correlation to the theoretical calculated normal force, the normal force from the LCM test was higher. The rolling force from the theoretical model correlated well to the rolling force from the LCM test while the simulation generated a higher rolling force. The side forces for the LCM test and the simulation model correlated well...|$|R
40|$|The SpeI/DpnI {{map of the}} 5. 9 Mb Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO (DSM 1707) genome was refined by {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) pulsed-field {{gel electrophoresis}} techniques (PFGE) which allow the complete and consistent physical mapping of any bacterial genome of interest. Single restriction digests were repetitively separated by PFGE employing different pulse times and ramps in order to detect all bands with optimum resolution. Fragment order was evaluated from the pattern of 2 D PFGE gels: 1. Partial-complete digestion. A partial restriction digest was separated in the first dimension, redigested to completion, and subsequently perpendicularly resolved in the second dimension. 2 D-gel comparisons of the ethidium bromide stain of all fragments and of the autoradiogram of end-labeled partial digestion fragments was nearly sufficient {{for the construction of}} the macrorestriction map. 2. Reciprocal gels. A complete restriction digest with enzyme A was run in the first dimension, redigested with enzyme B, and separated in the second orthogonal direction. The order of restriction digests was reverse on the second gel. In case of two rare-cutters, fragments were visualized by ethidium bromide staining or hybridization with genomic DNA. If a frequent and a rare <b>cutter</b> were employed, <b>linking</b> fragments were identified by end-labeling of the first digest. 3. A few small fragments were isolated by preparative PFGE and used as a probe for Southern analysis. [...] 38 SpeI and 15 DpnI fragments were positioned on the map. The zero point was relocated to the 'origin of replication'. The anonymous mapping techniques described herein are unbiased by repetitive DNA, unclonable genomic regions, unfavourable location of restriction sites, or cloning artifacts as frequently encountered in other top-down or bottom-up approaches...|$|R
