5|$|By November, {{proponents of}} the peace coin had {{realized}} that congressional approval was not necessary—as the Morgan dollar had been struck for more than 25 years, it was eligible for replacement {{at the discretion of}} the Secretary of the Treasury under an 1890 act. The Morgan design was then being used for large quantities of silver dollars as the Mint struck replacements for the melted coins under the Pittman Act. Though Congress had not yet convened, Baker contacted Fraser in early November to discuss details of the design competition. According to Burdette, Baker's newfound enthusiasm came from the fact that President Harding was about to formally declare an end to the war with Germany—a declaration needed because the US had not ratified the Treaty of Versailles. In addition, the Washington <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> <b>disarmament,</b> for which the administration had great hopes, was soon to convene. On November 19, Fraser notified competition participants by personal letter, sending official rules and requirements four days later, with submissions due by December 12. Competition participants included Hermon MacNeil, Victor D. Brenner, and Adolph Weinman, all of whom had designed previous U.S. coins.|$|E

500|$|The small Labour {{group in}} {{parliament}} had little influence over economic policy; Lansbury's term as leader {{was dominated by}} foreign affairs and disarmament, and by policy disagreements within the Labour movement. The official party position was based on collective security [...] through the League of Nations and on multilateral disarmament. Lansbury, supported {{by many in the}} PLP, adopted a position of Christian pacifism, [...] unilateral disarmament and the dismantling of the British Empire. Under his influence the party's 1933 conference passed resolutions calling for the [...] "total disarmament of all nations", and pledged to take no part in war. Pacifism became temporarily popular in the country; on 9 February 1933 the Oxford Union voted by 275 to 153 that it would [...] "in no circumstances fight for its King and Country", and the Fulham East by-election in October 1933 was easily won by a [...] Labour candidate committed to full disarmament. [...] Lansbury sent a message to the constituency in his position as Labour Leader: [...] "I would close every recruiting station, disband the Army and disarm the Air Force. I would abolish the whole dreadful equipment of war and say to the world: “Do your worst”." [...] October 1934 saw the emergence of the Peace Pledge Union; the 1934–35 Peace Ballot, an unofficial public [...] referendum, produced massive majorities against war. Meanwhile, Adolf Hitler had come to power in Germany, and had withdrawn from the international <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> <b>Disarmament</b> in Geneva. Blythe observes that Britain's noisy flirtations with pacifism [...] "drowned out the sounds from German dockyards", as German rearmament began.|$|E

5000|$|India {{also sought}} to improve {{relations}} with the United States, which had been strained due to the latter's support for Pakistan during the 1971 war and India's subsequent proximity with the Soviet Union. The Janata government announced its desire to achieve [...] "genuine" [...] non-alignment in the Cold War, which had been the long-standing national policy. In 1978, Jimmy Carter became the first U.S. president to make an official visit to India. Both nations sought to improve trade and expand cooperation in science and technology. Vajpayee represented India at the U.N. <b>conference</b> <b>on</b> nuclear <b>disarmament,</b> defending India's nuclear programme and its refusal to sign non-proliferation treaties.|$|R

2500|$|In March 1962, Sweden joined {{seven other}} neutral countries, {{members of the}} Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament, a {{predecessor}} to the <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> <b>Disarmament</b> (CD). In 1968, Sweden signed the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and thereby publicly committed itself against [...] the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Shortly after joining the NPT, Sweden became {{a founding member of}} the Zangger Committee, which was designed to work out the exact definitions of the material and equipment to be restricted by the NPT. The Committee drafted a “Trigger List” of [...] "source or special fissionable materials" [...] and [...] "equipment or materials specially designed or prepared for the processing, use, or production of fissile materials". [...] In continuation, Sweden has occupied an active position in generating of new agreements that would control the export of the listed items to non-NPT states. These agreements and Trigger List have subsequently constituted the first major agreement on nuclear export regulations.|$|E
2500|$|As {{chairman}} joint chiefs, Majid notably terminated {{all military}} debriefings of senior scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan and recognized his services {{done to the}} country publicly on first week of November 2008. [...] Earlier to this, Majid was known for welcoming dr. Qadeer Khan in the country's military science circles where Qadeer Khan was still welcomed. In 2010, while lecturing on nuclear weapons politics, Majid endorsed Qadeer Khan's services and stressed to the fact that: [...] "Pakistan had {{to be mindful of}} a blatant pursuit of military preponderance in its eastern neighborhood". Lecturing at the National Defence University, General Majid argued that [...] "a proposed fissile material cutoff treaty would target Pakistan specifically. Islamabad has refused to allow talks on such a pact to proceed at the International <b>Conference</b> <b>on</b> <b>Disarmament.</b> As chairman joint chiefs, Majid had asserted his role as principle military adviser to the [...] government of Prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani and President Asif Ali Zardari on the matters involving the nuclear policy, military affairs, and geostrategic positions of Pakistan. [...] He presented the government a tri-services combat framework to tackle the joint combat operations against the extreme elements; a plan which was duly approved by Prime minister Gillani as part of his war strategy. While presenting this plan Majid noted to Prime minister Gillani {{that there is a need}} to harmonize individual capacities of the services so that efforts are synergized within a framework of jointness and inter-operability to meet present and future challenges. He played a vital role in devising the government to change its foreign policy to neutral matters in Afghanistan, and to lessen the American influence in the country which had dismayed the civil society of the country.|$|E
