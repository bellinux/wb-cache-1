40|$|Abstract: This study, {{which used}} a {{prospective}} {{as well as}} a retrospective methodology, exam-ined the criminal records of 30 child molesters prior to, and up to 10 years after an index event of sexual abuse for which they were convicted: 73 % had <b>convictions</b> <b>for</b> other offences, 60 % had <b>convictions</b> <b>for</b> offences other than sex offences, 50 % had <b>convictions</b> <b>for</b> property offences, 27 % had <b>convictions</b> <b>for</b> offences involving violence, and 23 % had <b>convictions</b> <b>for</b> drug offences. Offending levels for nonsex offences were significantly higher than the general adult male population. Any theory concerning the dynamics of sex offending against children needs to account for the level of nonsex offences committed by child molesters...|$|R

5|$|In {{spite of}} his Roman Catholic leanings, {{evidenced}} {{by the use of}} pre-Reformation Latin texts for his motets and his 1606 <b>conviction</b> <b>for</b> recusancy, Peerson's position {{at the heart of the}} Anglican establishment confirms the overall esteem in which he was held.|$|E

5|$|The {{effort to}} avoid {{introducing}} the <b>conviction</b> <b>for</b> the murder of Anthony Smith worked against Silcott too.

This was when witnesses had placed Silcott at a Broadwater Youth Association meeting, making inflammatory speeches against the police.|$|E

States were thereafter obliged to include exemptions or lose funding; {{the wording of the}} exemptions made clear that they referred to Christian Science.|$|E
5|$|As more {{information}} about Burge's reign was published, activists worked to save some Chicago inmates on death row {{who claimed to have}} been wrongfully convicted.

Leighton and Abner Mikva, Illinois judge R. Eugene Pincham, and British activist Bianca Jagger, called for a stay of execution for Aaron Patterson, a death row inmate from Chicago.

5|$|In 1868 President Ulysses S. Grant {{appointed}} Harrison {{to represent}} {{the federal government in}} a civil suit filed by Lambdin P. Milligan, whose controversial wartime <b>conviction</b> <b>for</b> treason in 1864 led to the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case known as Ex parte Milligan. The civil case was referred to the U.S. Circuit Court for Indiana at Indianapolis, where it evolved into Milligan v. Hovey. Although the jury rendered a verdict in Milligan's favor and he had sought {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in damages, state and federal statutes limited the amount the federal government had to award to Milligan to five dollars plus court costs.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, 2007 at {{approximately}} 10 AM, Howard and Maureen Cotterman drove from Mexico to the Lukeville Port of Entry (POE).

The alert advised the inspector {{to be on the}} lookout for child pornography and due to the warning, the Cottermans were sent to a secondary inspection area.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{follow-up}} of a sample of 303 adolescent male sex of-fenders from New South Wales, Australia. Adult rearrest and reconviction data were obtained for 292 of these individuals. The mean observation period between their adjudication as adolescents and their follow-up as adults was 7. 3 years. Seventy-five (25 %) received further <b>convictions</b> <b>for</b> sexual offenses prior to their 18 th birthday. As adults, 25 (9 %) {{came to the attention}} of police for further alleged sexual offenses, including 14 (5 %) who received <b>convictions</b> <b>for</b> these offenses. Of these, 11 (79 %) also received new <b>convictions</b> <b>for</b> nonsexual offenses. Overall, 61. 3 % of subjects received <b>convictions</b> <b>for</b> nonsexual offenses as adults. Results suggest considerable diversity and persistence in delinquent and criminal behav-ior, and challenge assumptions about high transition rates from adolescent to adult sexual offending. KEY WORDS: adolescent sex offenders; recidivism; risk...|$|R

However, Warshak's sentence was vacated and remanded to the lower court because the court's previous ruling lacked an adequate explanation of losses to justify the sentence.|$|R
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{consumption of}} alcohol was recognized as a problem by Dr. Eli Todd in 1812. In a conversation with Edward Hooker on March 30, 1812, he stated {{that there was no}} single solution to alcoholism. “He advised a 3-pronged attack that was as follows: there should be an association of respectable men who would make it unfashionable to take ardent spirits; work houses of ‘idle, drinking persons’ after their third <b>conviction</b> <b>for</b> drunkenness; and heavy taxes on imported and domestic liquor”.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months later}} Governor John Hunter {{appointed}} him superintendent of convicts for the Hawkesbury region, a newly established area of farms {{to the northwest}} of Baker's own lands. His reputation was somewhat marred by a 1797 <b>conviction</b> <b>for</b> stealing a boat worth ₤16 from a neighbour, Thomas Raby. Baker admitted possession of the vessel but denied it was Raby's. He {{was found guilty of}} theft and fined a proportion of the vessel's value.|$|E

Deady represented him at trial and was to receive as payment Wimple’s land claim via his will. Wimple was convicted of the murder and sentenced to death, but was only hung after being recaptured from a jail break.
