Under these conditions the ratchet works against the <b>counter</b> <b>force,</b> thus producing a non-zero output power.

This study {{applies the}} {{finite element method}} (FEM) in con-junction with an abductive network to predict springback’s angle during the U-shaped bending process with <b>counter</b> <b>force.</b> To verify the {{prediction}} of FEM simulation for springback, the experimental data are compared {{with the results of}} current simulation. Bending force, effective stress distribution and springback are investigated for different process parameters, such as profile radius of die, blank holder <b>force</b> and <b>counter</b> <b>force</b> of U-shaped bending process, by finite element analysis. The abductive network is then utilized to synthesize the data sets obtained from numerical simulations. Finally, prediction model is established for predicting springback’s angle under a suitable range of process parameters...|$|R
