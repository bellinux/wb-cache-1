5|$|Morrow {{served as}} a {{delegate}} to the Republican National Convention in 1916, 1920, and 1928. In 1919, he was chosen by acclamation as his party's <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor.</b> This time, his opponent was James D. Black.

5|$|Both roadways were {{expected}} to be completed by January1, 1935. They were ultimately completed in October 1934, six months ahead of schedule. The Long Beach Loop Causeway was opened to extreme fanfare on October27, 1934, as was the Meadowbrook State Parkway with parades celebrating the event were held in Freeport and Rockville Centre, and they were attended by Robert Moses, at the time a <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>Governor</b> of New York, and Fiorello LaGuardia, the Mayor of New York City.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt {{was elected}} to {{represent}} Logan County in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1811, and was re-elected every year until 1815. In the gubernatorial election of 1828, the Democrats chose William T.

Oldham, but Oldham declined, and Breathitt was chosen as his replacement. Barry lost the governorship to National Republican Thomas Metcalfe, but Breathitt defeated Metcalfe's running mate Joseph R. Underwood by more than 1,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|In 1838, Greeley met Albany editor Thurlow Weed. Weed {{spoke for}} a liberal {{faction of the}} Whigs in his {{newspaper}} the Albany Evening Journal. He hired Greeley {{as editor of the}} state Whig newspaper for the upcoming campaign. The newspaper, the Jeffersonian, premiered in February 1838 and helped elect the Whig <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor,</b> William H. Seward. In 1839, Greeley worked for several journals, and took a month-long break to go as far west as Detroit.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Willson {{was chosen}} by acclamation as the Republican <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor.</b> Willson's {{opponent}} had been chosen at a nominating convention two years earlier. Governor Beckham had convinced the Democrats to hold their primary early so he could secure the party's nomination for the 1908 senatorial election {{while he was still}} serving as governor. Further, he wanted to influence the selection of his would-be successor. Using his clout as governor, he assured the selection of Samuel Wilbur Hager as the party's gubernatorial nominee.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{was freed}} from prison {{a year after}} his capture, {{as part of a}} {{prisoner}} exchange. He returned to Kentucky following his release and was honored at a public dinner on September 6, 1814. In 1816, he resigned as auditor of public accounts due to failing health. But, submitting to public demand, he became a <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> later that year. James Johnson, the other candidate for office, withdrew from the race due to Madison's popularity, thus the latter was elected without opposition.|$|E

5|$|To become {{governor}} of Ohio, a candidate {{must be a}} qualified elector in the state. This means that any <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> {{must be at least}} 18 {{years old at the time}} of his/her election, a resident of Ohio for at least 30 days before the election, and a U.S. citizen. Convicted felons and those deemed by the courts as incompetent to vote are not eligible.|$|E
5|$|After {{his service}} in the House, Brown took a break from politics, but re-entered the {{political}} arena as a <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> of Kentucky in 1891. He secured the Democratic nomination in a four-way primary election, then convincingly won the general election over his Republican challenger, Andrew T. Wood. Brown's administration, and the state Democratic Party, were split between gold standard supporters (including Brown) and supporters of the free coinage of silver. Brown's {{was also the first}} administration to operate under the Kentucky Constitution of 1891, and most of the legislature's time was spent adapting the state's code of laws to the new constitution. Consequently, little of significance was accomplished during Brown's term.|$|E
5|$|By 1877, {{differences}} with the Republican party leadership on the money question led him to consider other options. After initially supporting the Republican <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> that year, Weaver joined the Greenback Party in August. In 1878, Weaver accepted the Greenback nomination for Iowa's 6th congressional district. Although Weaver's political career up to then had been as a staunch Republican, Democrats in the 6th district considered that endorsing him was likely {{the only way to}} defeat Ezekiel S. Sampson, the incumbent Republican. Despite objections from some hard-money Democrats, the Greenback-Democrat ticket prevailed, and Weaver was elected with 16,366 votes to Sampson's 14,307.|$|E

5|$|Edwin Porch Morrow (November 28, 1877June 15, 1935) was an American politician, {{who served}} as the 40th Governor of Kentucky from 1919 to 1923. He was the only Republican elected to this office between 1907 and 1927. He championed the typical Republican causes of his day, namely equal rights for African-Americans and the use of force to quell violence. Morrow had been schooled in his party's {{principles}} by his father, Thomas Z. Morrow, who was its <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> in 1883, and his uncle, William O. Bradley, who was elected governor in 1895. Both men were founding members of the Republican Party in Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Slaughter was the {{favorite}} choice {{for governor of}} Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor.</b> Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited him and asked whether he would run. Shelby assured {{him that he had}} no desire to do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, he {{was elected}} county judge of Bourbon County. His most notable ruling in this {{capacity}} was to nullify the apprenticeship contracts of the Freedmen's Bureau in Kentucky. Hawes based this decision {{on the fact that}} the Bureau's powers extended only to states that had been part of the rebellion, which Kentucky had not. Hawes was also chosen master commissioner of the circuit court in 1866. In 1871, Hawes was mentioned as a possible <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> of Kentucky. In 1876, he helped frame his party's response to the disputed Hayes–Tilden presidential election. Hawes died in Paris, Kentucky on May 25, 1877 and was interred in Paris Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{never gave}} up on a return to public service. He ran an {{unsuccessful}} campaign for the U.S. Senate against John J. Crittenden in 1842. He briefly and futilely sought his party's nomination for president in 1844. He also ran as an independent <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>Governor</b> of Kentucky in 1848, but after talking with the Democratic candidate, Lazarus W. Powell, who had replaced Linn Boyd on the ticket, Johnson decided to drop out and back Powell. Some speculated that the real object of this campaign was to secure another nomination to the vice-presidency, but this hope was denied.|$|E
5|$|Originally from Ireland, Rutherford immigrated {{with his}} parents to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Colony, {{at the age of}} eighteen. In 1753 he moved to Rowan County, in the Province of North Carolina, where he married Elizabeth Graham. An active member of his community, Rutherford served in {{multiple}} civil occupations. He was a representative of both houses of the North Carolina House of Commons, as well as an unsuccessful <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>governor.</b> Rutherford was an advocate of the anti-federalist movement and was appointed President of the Legislative Council of the Southwest Territory in 1794. Rutherford retired to Sumner County, Tennessee, where he died on August 10, 1805, at the age of 84.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was built}} in 1934 as the Long Beach Loop Causeway, funded with money from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. It was {{completed}} six months ahead of schedule and officially opened on October27, 1934, by Robert Moses, then a <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>Governor</b> of New York, and New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. The plans to fund the highway included the implementation of tolls, which went into effect on January2, 1935. These tollbooths, once considered the murder site of Sonny Corleone in Mario Puzo's The Godfather, were closed in 1978 as part of Governor Hugh Carey's efforts to establish that year's state budget.|$|E
