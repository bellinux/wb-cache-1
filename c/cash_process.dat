40|$|Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) {{populations in}} the Southern Hemisphere (SH) {{were taken to the}} edge of {{extinction}} from over exploitation by whaling in the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Commercial whaling on SH humpback whales ended in 1963 (apart from illegal catches) and a moratorium on all commercial whaling was implemented in 1986. Since this time, many but not all, humpback whale {{populations in the}} SH have shown signs of recovery. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) is currently undertaking a review of the status of all SH humpback whale populations. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the population status, structure and migratory interchange of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales (SHH) with a specific focus on east Australian humpback whales (EAH). This population has shown a strong recovery over the last 20 years. However, the migratory interchange and linkages among SHH populations, including EAH and neighbouring populations in Oceania, is not well understood. This uncertainty presents a potential challenge for the accurate assessment of stock structure and also makes it difficult to estimate pre-exploitation population size accurately and therefore determine the present status of their recovery. This thesis documents the movement patterns of EAH based on existing and previously unpublished Discovery mark data. These data indicate that SHH form relatively discrete groups with strong linkages between tropical breeding grounds and specific Antarctic feeding areas. There is a relatively low incidence of large-scale movement between feeding areas, perhaps with the exception of Breeding Stock E (comprised of EAH, New Caledonia and Tonga breeding stocks), which appears to have a more broadly dispersed system of interchange between multiple breeding and feeding areas. These findings are consistent with those of similar recent studies using molecular and photo-identification techniques. It now appears that the dispersal of whales from Breeding Stock E is considerably wider than was originally considered to be their feeding area (between 130 ° E and 170 ° W), extending from 95 ° W to 87 ° E and covering a range of approximately 175 ° of longitude – nearly half the globe. The IWC review involves an in-depth evaluation of the status of whale stocks. It includes the examination of issues such as current stock size, recent population trends, carrying capacity and productivity. This thesis provides valuable information on the recent population trend for EAH during their northward migration between 1998 and 2004. The annual rate of increase observed for humpback whales migrating past Cape Byron between 1998 and 2004 is calculated to be 11. 0 % (95 % CI 2. 3 – 20. 5). This research also derived two population estimates based on photo-identification capture recapture methods. The first estimate of 7, 041 (95 % CI: 4, 075 - 10, 008) is based on a multi-point single year (2005) population estimate using photo-identification data collected at Byron Bay, Hervey Bay and Ballina. The second estimate of 7, 390 (95 % CI: 4, 040 - 10, 739) is a multi-year population estimate for the population in 2005 using photo identification data collected at Byron Bay between 1999 and 2005. These are the first and only population estimates available for these sites. The results from this work are consistent with results for other survey areas on the east coast of Australia using different methodology. While the population estimates presented here utilise different assumptions and are potentially subject to different biases, the fact these studies obtained comparable results provides good confidence in the estimates. Already data from this thesis have been applied for the purposes of conservation management. They were presented by the author to the IWC Comprehensive Assessment of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales (<b>CASH)</b> <b>process</b> and were a critical source of information in that process. Specifically, they were used {{to reduce the number of}} plausible stock structure hypotheses, to develop scenarios for the allocation of historic catch from feeding grounds to Breeding Stocks, and made a vital contribution to the identification of stock structure itself. The thesis also reviews the management of EAH in Australia, their status under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and identifies further research required in order to address unresolved management and conservation questions. A review of the current status of the EAH population determined that they no longer meet the Threatened Species criteria under the EPBC Act and should be considered for delisting. Overall, this thesis provides new insights into EAH population structure, status and management issues, and summarises an extensive body of work by the author with the support of a range of collaborators. This work will allow the IWC and Australian management authorities to better manage and conserve EAH into the future...|$|E
40|$|During {{the recent}} years, {{electronic}} payment methods {{have become more}} customary and in cases more preferable. Nevertheless, cash remains a popular form of payment due, inter alia, to its ubiquity. Large use of cash is associated with security issues, investment costs, logistics costs of transport and handling cash, personnel costs, and the like. To deal with these issues, many retailers have, to different extents, outsourced cash handling services to CiT companies. Kappe’ and Schiphol Airport Retail (SAR) are two retail groups functioning {{at a number of}} locations in Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. They currently outsource part of their cash handling services to ABN-AMRO and GWK-Travelex. This results in a further increase in costs incurred by Kappe’ and SAR. Consequently, enhancing the efficiency of money flow is of significant importance to both corporations. The aim of this research is to develop <b>cash</b> handling <b>processes</b> which can bring about a more efficiency. This is done firstly by conducting a literature review on the reasons behind large costs of cash handling for retailers. Then the current <b>processes</b> of <b>cash</b> handling at Kappe' and SAR are studied to explore their deficiencies. After that, alternatives (e. g. automation, joint cash office, clustering) which can bring about a more efficient <b>cash</b> handling <b>process</b> are proposed and assessed on criteria of interest to the problem owners (Kappe' and SAR). The implementation chapter is done for the selected alternative. In the next stage, the prudence of the selected processes is e-evaluated by using a multi-criteria analysis methodology and also based on the trends in customers’ use of cash in payments.

The invoice data used in this thesis is imbalanced, because on-time invoice and delayed invoice classes are not approximately equally represented.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} fact {{in finance}} and economics is that moneyhas a time value, meaning {{that if we}} want to value an amount ofmoney we get at some future date we should discount the amountfrom the future date back to today. When facing a stream ofcash flows occurring at di®erent times we discount each ofthe cash flows using suitable discount rates and then sum thecontributions. This sum of discounted cash flows defines thevalue today of this stream. Most future cash flows that appearin models in finance and economics are assumed to be stochastic(nondefaultable bonds being a counter example). To be able tovalue these stochastic cash flows we also have to takeexpectations. In some cases even the discount rate should bemodelled as a stochastic object. The purpose of the two papersin this licentiate thesis (9 ̆ 2 On the Valuation of Cash Flows 9 ̆ 6 Discrete Time Models 9 ̆ 2 and 9 ̆ 2 On the Valuation ofCash Flows 9 ̆ 6 Continuous Time Models 9 ̆ 2) is to establishgeneral properties of the value process. As time passes twothings happen. Firstly, the cash flows that are realised are nomore parts of the value and secondly, the information we canuse to determine the expected cash flows and discount ratesincreases. The two papers consider discrete time models and continuoustime models respectively. Of course any continuous time modelis necessarily an idealisation. Thus one could argue from amodelling point of view that we should use discrete timemodels. The main reason for using continuous time models isthat we have the powerful machinery of stochastic calculus athand. Discrete time models are mostly used in practice whenvaluing a firm or a project, while the continuous time settingis more frequently used in thoretical approaches to valuation. Most of the results are parallelled in the two papers. Adi®erence is that we discuss some convergence results forthe value in discrete time which do not occur in the continuoustime paper. The reason for not including this in the continuoustime paper is because we find it a more important question indiscrete time. On the other hand the Brownian models incontinuous time, where the Martingale Representation Theorem isan important tool, make the analysis much more transparent. In both papers we first define the underlying objects: thediscount <b>process</b> and the <b>cash</b> flow <b>process.</b> We then define,using these two processes, the value process (i. e. the expecteddiscounted value of the cash flow stream). We show that thediscounted value tends to zero almost surely, and that thereare three equivalent ways of writing the value process, each ofwhich has its own merits. We also extend this result to thecase when the <b>cash</b> flow <b>process</b> and the value process areevaluated at a stopping time. The first paper, on discrete timemodels, then continues by showing examples from finance,economics, and insurance where the discounted value processplays an important role. Finally we present two propositionswith necessary conditions for the value process to convergealmost surely. The second paper, on continuous time models,discusses some properties of the local dynamics of the valueprocess and then continues with Brownian models. We show thatthe value process can equivalently be expressed as a solutionto a forward-backward stochastic di®erential equation. Finally we show that under some additional assumptions there isa one-to-one correspondance between the <b>cash</b> flow <b>process</b> andthe value process. We also investigate the inverse problem offinding a <b>cash</b> flow <b>process</b> generating a given value processand discuss applications to real options. NR 2014080...|$|R
