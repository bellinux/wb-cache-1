The experiment was conducted at Clarksville Horticultural Experimental Station (Michigan State Univ.) on 9 -year-old ‘Imperial Gala’ apple trees on M- 9 (n = 36). During the summer (20 June) after June drop, yield was adjusted according to different number of fruit per trunk cross sectional area (TCSA) to obtain three crop load levels: high (13. 5 fruit/TCSA), medium (7. 1 fruit/TCSA), and low (2. 1 fruit/TCSA). Each crop load level was defoliated (25 %) three times during the season (8 July, 25 and 19 Aug.) leaving three thinned trees for each level of crop load un-defoliated as control treatment. Spur canopy daily assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (gs), internal CO 2 concentration (Ci), fruit growth and shoot length were measured at weekly intervals after crop load adjustment until harvest, and 1 week before harvest (14 Sept.), Chl and nitrogen leaf content was also determined. A in high <b>cropping</b> <b>trees</b> was not affected by defoliation at any time, however in medium and low <b>cropping</b> <b>trees</b> there was an increase from 5 % to 20 % at each time after 3 days from defoliation. A was higher during the season (from 10 to 18 %) in high <b>cropping</b> <b>trees</b> than in medium and low <b>cropping</b> <b>trees.</b> The total Chl and nitrogen was lower in low <b>cropping</b> <b>trees</b> than in medium and high <b>cropping</b> <b>trees</b> and not affected by defoliation, as well as total yield, fruit diameter and shoot length. Results reveal compensation capacity of spur leaves subtending the fruits in medium and low <b>cropping</b> <b>trees.</b> This indicates that leaf photosynthesis compensation to leaf damage occurs without reduction in fruit diameter or total yield per tree...|$|R

50|$|Avoidance {{of damage}} to the {{understorey}} {{will always be a}} desideratum. Sauder's (1990) paper on mixedwood harvesting describes studies designed to evaluate methods of reducing non-trivial damage to understorey residuals that would compromise their chance of becoming a future <b>crop</b> <b>tree.</b> Sauder concluded that: (1) operational measures that protected residual stems may not unduly increase costs, (2) all felling, conifers and hardwoods, {{needs to be done in}} one operation to minimize the entry of the feller-buncher into the residual stand, (3) several operational procedures can reduce understorey damage, some of them without incurring extra costs, and (4) successful harvesting of treatment blocks depends primarily on the intelligent location of skid trails and landings. In summary, the key to protecting the white spruce understorey without sacrificing logging efficiency is a combination of good planning, good supervision, the use of appropriate equipment, and having conscientious, well-trained operators.Even the best plan will not reduce understorey damage unless its implementation is supervised.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Providing {{economic}} incentives to landholders {{is an effective}} way of promoting sustainable forest management, conservation and restoration. In Hawaii, the main native hardwood species with commercial value is Acacia koa (koa), but lack of successful examples of koa plantation forestry hinders private investment. Financial models, which have been offered to encourage investment, assume that a particular minimum volume of merchantable wood will be harvested at rotation age. No {{studies have been done}} to determine the appropriateness of the assumed volumes for koa plantations. Three 18 - to 28 -year-old koa plantations were studied to determine butt-log size, crown class and <b>crop</b> <b>tree</b> potential. Estimates of present and future merchantable sawtimber volume were made for each plantation. Results indicate that most existing plantation koa trees fork so close to the ground that they will produce little to no merchantable wood. Projected sawtimber yields from crop trees in these plantations at age 45 years are 10, 15 and 90 m 3 /ha, which are below the 135 m 3 /ha yield used in the most recent financial analysis of returns on investment in koa forestry. Relaxing the <b>crop</b> <b>tree</b> criteria gives higher volume yields, but two plantations still fall short of the assumed target yield by 43 and 52 %...|$|E

After three growing seasons, the growth response and foliar status of the <b>crop</b> <b>trees</b> were examined and this response was related to site and foliar characteristics. There was a small and highly variable additive response to fertilization and thinning; diameter growth of <b>crop</b> <b>trees</b> increased relative to the controls an average of 0. 3 [*]cm with thinning, 0. 3 [*]cm with either N-only or complete fertilization and 0. 6 [*]cm when thinned and fertilized.

40|$|The {{effect of}} crown form on stem biomass {{production}} {{was investigated in}} an 18 - 19. year-old Norway spruce stand (Picea abies (L.) Karst.).

However, the production of stem biomass per crown projected area was {{more than twice as}} much in pendula trees as in normal-crowned trees. Results indicate that the crown form of pendula spruce is less plastic than that of normal-crowned spruce suggesting that such trees might maintain a high stemwood yield per unit ground area with increasing stand density.
