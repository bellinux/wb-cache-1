For the most part, chemical treatments are ineffective and some, like hypochlorites and methyl bromide, can denaturalize parchment. Prior to cleaning, any flaking or vulnerable media is consolidated to ensure it does not detach from the parchment substrate.

40|$|The oxygen-enriched {{combustion}} concept, {{which can}} minimize off-gas production, {{has been applied}} to the incineration of combustible uranium-containing wastes from a nuclear fuel fabrication facility. A simulation for oxygen combustion shows the off-gas production can be reduced by a factor of 6. 7 theoretically, compared with conventional air combustion. The laboratory-scale oxygen enriched incineration (OEI) process with a thermal capacity of 350 MJ/h is composed of an oxygen feeding and control system, a combustion chamber, a quencher, a ceramic filter, an induced draft fan, a condenser, a stack, an off-gas recycle path, and a measurement and control system. Test burning with <b>cleaning</b> <b>paper</b> and office paper in this OEI process shows that the thermal capacity is about 320 MJ/h, 90 % of design value and the off-gas reduces by a factor of 3. 5, compared with air combustion. The CO concentration for oxygen combustion is lower than that of air combustion, while the O 2 concentration in off-gas is kept above 25 vol % for a simple incineration process without any grate. The NOx concentration in an off-gas stream does not reduce significantly due to air incoming by leakage, and the volume and weight reduction factors are not changed significantly, which suggests a need for an improvement in sealing...|$|E

40|$|The archaeological bone {{assemblage}} of Hardinxveld-Giessendam Polderweg (5500 - 5000 BC) and De Bruin (5500 - 4450 BC), includes remains which allow investigating {{the importance of}} plant working and the fishing technologies for Late Mesolithic wetland communities of the Rhine Meuse region. The main emphasis of this thesis is on the microwear analysis of the worked bones in comparison with experimental and archaeological data. The sample selected displays different kinds of evidences of contact with soft plant on the bone tools, such as Urtica dioica and Salix: therefore it has been organized through a functional classification according to the variability of contact materials and the distribution and polish of the wear. The tool-type identified are Spatula-spacers to weave or make fishing nets; De-scaling tools, to de-scale {{the skin of the}} fish; awls and Projectile-awls, to pierce bark; Ad hoc elongated tools in bird bone, to work Urtica dioica; Harpoons and Decorated objects. This evidence for different plantbased crafts has been heavily challenged by problems of conservation and taphonomy, which influenced the readability of the sample. Post-excavation processes have been investigated from a microscopic point of view, allowing the identification of <b>cleaning</b> <b>paper</b> and plastic sieve wear traces that are evident on the bone surface. The state of the bone assemblage opened a window on more theoretical issues; concerning the interpretation of hidden crafts in archaeology. The research has been directed towards a reasonable (sensu Putnam) system of data comparison, involving contextual, ethnographic and anthropological data, with the aim to propose a theoretical toolkit for better understand the Forma mentis of the inhabitants of Hardinxveld-Giessendam...|$|E
40|$|Background: Paper based artworks are {{probably}} ones {{of the most}} difficult materials to restore, because of their complexity and fragile structure. Cleaning of paper artifacts, one of the process commonly carried out during restoration, usually involves the use of solvents (organic or not), that may cause several troubles, like swelling and dissolution of some components, and may also be harmful to the users. Results: Innovative procedure for <b>cleaning</b> <b>paper</b> artworks is reported in this paper. It is based on the use of rheoreversible, biocompatible hydrogels containing poly(ethylene oxide) or poly(ethylene oxide) -poly(propylene oxide) -poly(ethylene oxide) and α-cyclodextrin. We have studied two types of polymer with different hydrophobic properties in order to obtain two different hydrogels with slightly different cleaning capabilities. Our overall strategy has been to develop innovative systems based on these hydrogels so as to better confront the problems that a restorer faces during the cleaning of paper samples. Rheoreversible hydrogels are intriguing materials because their application and removal is not invasive and does not require a liquid treatment that could induce damage to the paper. Conclusions: These hydrogels have been applied in the cleaning of both new and aged paper samples and their cleaning efficiency has been established. Moreover, by comparison with traditional methods, the greater efficacy of the proposed procedure has been demonstrated. To assess the cleaning efficacy of these hydrogels, a multidisciplinary approach, combining non-invasive spectroscopic infrared techniques together with scanning electron microscopy, chromatographic (HPLC) analysis and pH investigations has been used. Near infrared spectroscopy spectra were coupled with a chemometric analysis to achieve a better interpretation of data. This work constitutes a preliminary step towards focused study in the development of α-cyclodextrin/polymer hydrogel family which will allow cleaning of paper artifacts with peculiar characteristics.

40|$|Hypothesis: Wet <b>cleaning</b> {{of ancient}} <b>papers</b> {{is one of}} the most {{critical}} steps during a conservation treatment. It is used to improve the optical qualities of a graphic work and remove dust and by-products resulting from cellulose degradation.

Experiments: The use of rigid hydrogel of Gellan gum as an alternative <b>paper</b> <b>cleaning</b> treatment is developed. The application of a rigid hydrogel minimizes damages caused by the use of water, and therefore is much more respectful for the original integrity of ancient paper. Findings: Gellan hydrogel has been used to clean paper samples belonging to different centuries (from XVI to XIX) and therefore, characterized by a different story in terms of degradation condition and paper composition. Several techniques, such as high-performance liquid chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and pH measurements, has been employed to assess the effectiveness and safety of the proposed cleaning method...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to argue that {{cleaning}} is part of a social process, and this applies to conservation cleaning as well as to domestic <b>cleaning.</b> This <b>paper</b> identifies four paradigms that have influenced textile conservation cleaning: the domestic, the sacred and heroic, the art-historical, and the evidential. This analysis is informed by the anthropologist Douglas’ contention that dirt is matter out of place and is therefore socially determined and culturally informed. The domestic paradigm is based on a link, that usually remains uncontested, between cleanliness and social and/or moral worth, as demonstrated by examples drawn from literature. The effects of the other three paradigms are demonstrated via analysis of published case studies. It is argued that raising awareness of these influential paradigms enables decisions about conservation cleaning to be more overtly debated by curators and conservators and to be more fully documented. <br/...|$|R
