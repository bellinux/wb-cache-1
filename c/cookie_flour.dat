40|$|Celiac Disease (CD) is an immune-mediated {{disease in}} genetically {{susceptible}} individuals caused by intolerance to gluten protein in some cereals, resulting in mucosal inflammation, which causes malabsorption. An effective treatment for CD is a gluten-free diet that excludes cereals containing gluten. One {{of the most}} desirable wheat products is the cookie, which is considered suitable for all ages due to its low manufacturing cost, convenience, long shelf life and good eating quality. Therefore, the production of local, high quality and affordable gluten-free cookies was the main objective of this study in which lupine flour {{was used as a}} main wheat flour alternative. Eight gluten-free <b>cookie</b> <b>flour</b> blends were prepared: 100 % Lupine Flour (AF), 50 % lupine flour and 50 % corn starch (BF), 40 % lupine flour and 60 % corn starch (CF), 30 % lupine flour and 70 % corn starch (DF), 30 % lupine flour, 40 % rice flour and 30 % corn starch (EF), 30 % lupine flour, 40 % corn flour and corn starch 30 % (FF), 20 % lupine flour, 30 % corn flour, 20 % rice flour and 30 % corn starch (GF) and 20 % lupine flour, 30 % rice flour, 20 % corn flour and 30 % corn starch (HF), with equal amounts of hydrocolloids (1. 5 % xanthan and 1. 5 % carrageenan) which were used as a functional gluten alternative, as well as a control sample with Wheat flour (WC). The chemical composition, physical characteristics and sensory evaluation of all treated flour blends and cookies were determined. The results of the chemical analysis indicated that corn and wheat flour were significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher in moisture content, while lupine flour had significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher contents of lipid, protein, fiber and ash. Starch significantly (p≤ 0. 05) showed the highest carbohydrate content. The moisture of blend BC was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher than all blends and blend AC was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher in ash, protein, lipid and fiber content. The carbohydrate content of blend DC was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher than the other blends, in which blend AC significantly (p≤ 0. 05) contained the lowest amount. Physical analysis revealed that the spread factor of blend GC was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher than the other blends, while blend CC significantly (p≤ 0. 05) had the lowest value. The results of color measurements (L*, a* and b*) using a Milolat colorimeter revealed that the L* parameter had the highest value in the control sample WC, while the a* parameter was highest in blend AC and b* was highest in blend EC. The results of the sensory evaluation, judged by panelists, indicated that blend BC received the highest score in overall impression, while the control sample WC received the overall highest score in flavor and crust color, blend GC in overall color and the control sample WC in overall texture, blend AC in crust color, crumb color, hardness and after taste. Finally, blends BC and GC had the best acceptability compared to the control sample...|$|E

Six types of formulations of cookies were prepared with whole amaranth flour ranging from 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 %. These cookies were evaluated for physical (thickness, diameter, spread ratio, and bake loss), textural, and organoleptic attributes.

50|$|The {{secondary}} {{sector of the}} economy (mining, construction, and industry) is almost entirely concentrated in the coastal area of the state in the municipalities of Campeche, Ciudad del Carmen and Champotón. Mining, mostly oil production, accounts for 52.8% of the state’s GDP. This oil lies off the coast of the state, in a shallow water section of the Gulf of Mexico called the Sonda de Campeche. Campeche oil and gas production accounts for 37% of Mexico’s total with crude oil alone accounting for 76% in absolute numbers. Campeche does not have metal deposits but it does have deposits of building stone, such as sandstone, marble and limestone, sand, gravel, lime, clay and other minerals. Most deposits are located in the municipalities of Hopelchén, Champotón and Calakmul. In the far north of the coast region, there are important deposits of salt. Construction and manufacturing account for 6.7% of the state’s GDP. The most common type of industry relates to food and food processing including seafood, soft drinks, <b>cookies,</b> <b>flour,</b> sugar and honey. Another common industry is that of building materials such as cinderblock, wood products and the processing of building stone. Most industries are small with little financing for technology and growth. Since the 1990s, factories of the “maquiladora” type have opened in the state, such as the Calkiní Shirt Company in Tepacan, Calkiní, Textiles Blazer in Lerma, Campeche, Quality Textil de Campeche in Becal, Calkiní and Karims Textile and Apparel México in the city of Campeche.|$|R

40|$|There {{is limited}} {{information}} on the utilization of sorghum for human consumption in El Salvador. Increased wheat prices have driven the baking industry to seek alternative cereals for manufacturing of their products. The white color and bland taste characteristics of Salvadorian sorghum is ideal {{for use as a}} partial substitute of wheat (up to 50 percent) or alone in baked goods and a wide variety of foods. Further {{information on the}} grain quality, milling characteristics and impact on end-product was assessed to make better use of the available grain. Three different varieties of improved and local cultivars (RCV, Native and ZAM 912) were evaluated for their grain, flour and end-product quality. Grain hardness, color and composition of the grains varied from hard to intermediate to soft. Burr, hammer and roller milling were used for sorghum flour production. Impact of grain characteristics and milling quality was evaluated through the flours produced and their end-product quality. Grain hardness significantly affects flour and final product characteristics. Harder grain, RCV, produced flours more difficult to cook and with a grittier texture than those produced from Native cultivars (floury endosperm). Cupcakes produced from harder grain flours had lower volume and harder texture than cupcakes made from the Native varieties. ZAM 912 was an intermediate hard sorghum variety and produced the darkest flour and darkest cupcakes due to its pericarp hue. Appropriate use of this grain?s flour can be used in baked products with a darker hue (e. g. chocolate pastries). Harder grain flours can be utilized in coarse crumb products (e. g. cookies, horchata, and atole). Hammer mills produced the coarsest particles for all the varieties evaluated. Burr mills produced flour with similar cooking and end-product texture qualities as the roller mill. However, burr mills are not suitable for production of large quantities of whole sorghum flour. Nevertheless, they are more affordable for small entrepreneurs. Cultivars analyzed produce quality flour {{that can be used in}} an array of baked foods, i. e. ethnic beverages, porridges, <b>cookies,</b> <b>flour</b> mixes, tortillas, sweet breads.
