The {{aim of this study}} was to assess <b>reasons</b> of surgery <b>cancellation,</b> and to provide a comprehensive list of <b>cancellation</b> <b>reasons</b> to implement in hospital information system for improving documentation. Method: This study is an applied-descriptive study which was conducted in two parts. In first part, all medical records of hospitalized patients in Shafa educational hospital during 6 months period which had been assigned a cancellation code based on ICD- 10, were assessed. The data were collected through a researcher-made checklist and have been analyzed using SPSS. V 18 software. The second part was literature review which provided a list of surgery <b>cancellation</b> <b>reasons.</b> To retrieve the relevant papers PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched. Finally the results of two parts of the study were combined and a comprehensive list of surgery <b>cancellation</b> <b>reasons</b> was developed.

40|$|The data {{required}} for heterotic string theory with gauge group G, which for anomaly <b>cancellation</b> <b>reasons</b> must either be E 8 x E 8 or Spin(32) /Z 2, consist of the following: a ten-dimensional space-time X and a principal G-bundle P. The {{fields in the}} theory consist of: a metric on X, a connection on P and a B-field which is, roughly speaking, a two-form on X. As in a gauge theory, these fields are considered up to gauge equivalence.

40|$|Context: Software project {{cancellations}} {{are often}} caused by mistakes {{made during the}} project, and such cancellations make a strong economic impact. We analyzed five cancelled software engineering projects. One case was an internal product development project {{of a company that}} sells products to its customers. The other four cases were different software engineering projects, and outcomes of these projects were planned to be delivered to external customers. Objective: This study reports a post-mortem analysis of five software engineering projects with the aim of providing more knowledge about the <b>reasons</b> for <b>cancellation</b> decisions and the causes behind those reasons. Method: The research method is case study. A method for a document-based post-mortem analysis was developed and post-mortem analysis was performed. All project documentation was available for analysis. Results: The <b>reasons</b> for the <b>cancellation</b> decisions were well-known ones. In four cases of five, the outcome of the project was to be delivered to an external customer, but in these cases the causes of the <b>cancellation</b> <b>reasons</b> were not found from the normal project documentation. In these cases the cause of the cancellation originated in a phase {{before the start of the}} project and therefore the project was doomed before it was started.

40|$|Purpose: Previous {{research}} {{investigating a}} 50 % down payment policy for elective surgeries demonstrated {{that a substantial}} number of self pay patients failed to receive recommended surgery due to the down payment cost. The current study analyzes the effect of a new, more liberal sliding scale down payment policy implemented at this same public hospital and assesses the impact on health care access for self pay patients. Methods: Data was collected from the admissions office and the pre-operative assessment office where elective surgery <b>cancellation</b> <b>reasons</b> were recorded. Chi-square tests were used to determine the statistical significance between data sets. Results: 448 recorded cancellations were documented over an 8 month period. Of those records, 6. 9 % (n= 31) were self pay patients and 93 % (n= 417) had insurance. Of the 31 self pay patients, 51. 6 % (n= 16) had cancelled stating financial reasons, while 4. 8 % (n= 20) of the insured canceled for financial reasons (p< 0. 0001). In comparison to the previous study performed by Kaufman and Chavez, the results revealed a 50 % {{decrease in the number of}} self pay patients failing to receive recommended surgery. Of those self pay patients who did not receive surgery, there was no significant difference in the rate of canceling for financial reasons (p= 0. 18). Conclusions: Despite gender or race, self-pay patients cancel elective surgeries at a rate significantly greater than insured patients. The more liberal sliding scale down payment policy appears effective in reducing the overall number of self pay patients who decline elective surgery for financial reasons. Self pay patients are still facing financial barriers to health care access despite the sliding scale payment policy...|$|R

Another reason is perceived reliability of service. Consultants have pointed to {{a large number of}} delays and <b>cancellations</b> as <b>reasons</b> for low passenger. However, the effect of these flight delays on actual travel times is less clear. Because connections are usually necessary when traveling from small airports, departure delays may lead to missed connections. In the case of a cancellation, need to wait several hours (often overnight) for the next flight due to the small number of daily departures.

40|$|In this master’s thesis {{two types}} of {{dual-mode}} multiuser detectors are introduced that either dynamically switch detection mode between matched-filter and decor-relator or matched-filter and successive interference <b>cancellation</b> (SIC).

When the background interferences dominates compared to the multiple access interference (MAI), the decorrelator performs worse than the matched-filter, and the faster matched-filter should be used. The SIC receiver is sensitive to poor channel estimates. When the channel is rapidly varying it is harder to obtain good estimates and the SIC will suffer a severe performance degradation under these conditions. This leads to that a dual-mode design can switch to the faster matched-filter without losing much in performance.

30|$|A 5 G concept {{tailored}} {{for small}} cells was proposed in [2], optimized for dense local area deployments. The system assumes {{the usage of}} 4 × 4 MIMO transceivers and receivers with interference suppression capabilities. Though originally designed as a HD time division duplex (TDD) system, the proposed concept can easily support FD communication. In order to have an operational FD node, the self-interference (SI), i.e., the interference caused by the transmit antenna to the receive antenna located in the same device should be attenuated as much as possible, ideally below the receiver noise power level. Several techniques were proposed to provide high levels of self-interference cancellation (SIC) [3 – 7]. In [7], a detailed study of the passive SIC for FD infrastructure nodes is presented. Several techniques are analyzed, individually and jointly, and then evaluated experimentally. The authors argue that the main problem in SIC are the reflections or multi-path, while the direct link is easier to cancel. The former requires active suppression while the latter is tackled with passive <b>cancellation.</b> For this <b>reason,</b> the authors recommend to apply both active and passive cancellations whenever possible. Finally, the experimental {{results show that the}} most appropriate approach is to combine directional antennas with cross-polarization and an absorber. Recent results show that SI can be reduced of around 100 dB [6, 8]. This may suffice for considering FD a realistic option, at least according to transmit power constraints.|$|R

We studied elective operating theatre bookings in general surgical discipline. On the day of surgery the intended list was noted and a list of <b>cancellations</b> with the <b>reason</b> was noted by the attending anaesthesiologist. 1590 patients were scheduled for elective surgical procedures in 458 operation rooms. 30. 3 % patients were cancelled on the day of surgery. Of these, 59. 7 % were cancelled due to lack of availability of theatre time, 10. 8 % were cancelled because of medical reasons and 16. 2 % did not turned up on the day of surgery. In 5. 4 % patients, surgery was cancelled by surgeons due to a change in the surgical plan, 3. 7 % were cancelled because of administra-tive reasons, and 4. 2 % patients were postponed because of miscellaneous reasons. We believe that many of the on-the-day surgery cancellations of elective surgery were potentially avoidable.

The requirement of the instruments necessary for scheduled surgical listshould be discussed a day prior to planned OR list and arranged. The non-availability of the surgeon should be informed in time so that another case is substituted in that slot. All patients who have met PACU discharge criteria must be discharged promptly to prevent delay in shifting out of the operated patient.

40|$|Frequency {{division}} duplex (FDD) is {{the most}} widely used full duplex technique for modern wireless communication systems. A device called a duplexer is needed in order to separate the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX) signals. To avoid RX being saturated and desensitized, the isolation between the TX and RX ports of the duplexer needs to be as large as possible. However, such a duplexer is less desirable for a base station due to its bulky size, high cost and design challenges. Relaxing the isolation performance requirement of the duplexer allows TX signal to appear in the RX path. Such a signal is known as TX leakage and consists of in-band and out-of-band portions. Due {{to the fact that the}} in-band leakage can’t be filtered out with conventional filtering techniques, an active cancellation system is required. This thesis will present a novel wide band TX leakage cancellation approach along with two new modelling techniques. The cancellation system is based on the analog finite impulse response (FIR) filter structure and consists of several cancellation paths (also known as taps). In each of the taps, there is an attenuator, phase shifter and delay line. These components are utilized to recondition the reference signal which is the replica of the output signal of the high power amplifier (PA) in the TX path. The output of the cancellation system (the cancellation signal) in theory should have the same amplitudes, but 180 � phase offsets from the leakage signal within the band of interest. By combining the cancellation signal and the leakage, the latter can thus be suppressed. The two novel modelling techniques, named as the modified adaptive delay filter using direct cross-correlation (MADF-DC) and the modified compressed sampling matching pursuit (MCoSaMP) are proposed in this thesis. The two algorithms are developed from the classic adaptive delay filter (C-ADF) and the classic compressed sampling matching pursuit (C-CoSaMP), respectively. These modelling techniques can provide the optimization of not only the amplitudes and phase, but the delays. They are designed for the cancellation system in order to achieve wide band cancellation with the minimum hardware resources. The evaluation of the cancellation system was carried out utilizing a test bench, which represented a typical base station. Experimental results show that greater than 15 dB of cancellation has been achieved for 35 MHz bandwidth at the carrier frequency of 897. 5 MHz using four taps. In contrast, such result is about 7 dB less than the simulated <b>cancellation</b> performance. The <b>reasons</b> of such performance degradation have been analysed and will be presented in this thesis. vi...|$|R
40|$|Background: Preoperative {{assessment}} clinics {{have been}} employed in many institutions to manage perioperative risks 1. These clinics {{provide an opportunity}} to stratify patients on the basis of risk prior to surgery, to make timely multidisciplinary referrals where appropriate, and to prescribe medical therapies according to the current best evidence resulting, in fewer last-minute <b>cancellations</b> for medical <b>reasons</b> 2 and a shorter inpatient pre-operative stay 3. The Anaesthetic Pre-Operative Clinic (APOC-GSH) was introduced to Groote Schuur Hospital in 2009 with the aim of assessing and optimising high risk patients undergoing intermediate or high risk surgery. The vision of the clinic is to decrease perioperative morbidity and mortality, rationally and costconsciously investigate patients, as well as to reduce theatre cancellations of inappropriately assessed and managed patients. The clinic, together with relevant role players, attempts to risk stratify patients in making an informed decision whether the intended perioperative risks are acceptable. Patients referred to the clinic fall into two categories. Either the surgical date has been scheduled and patients are referred to APOC-GSH for optimization, or the referral is for assessment of suitability to undergo an anaesthetic and thus the treatment modality hinges on the fitness for surgery. Objective The intention of the audit is to create a database of the patients seen at APOC-GSH during 2014. Primary objectives are: 1 Referral pattern: - What proportion of patients are referred for improvement of medical condition? - What proportion of patients are referred for an assessment of operability? 2 What interventions were recommended? - What was the influence of interventions on operability and timing of surgery? - Does the clinic improve theatre efficiency by reducing cancellations of patients who required further interdisciplinary discussion and investigations? Methods: Data collection will be based on the review of APOC-GSH clerking notes and hospital patient records. The following information will be collected and entered into an Excel spread sheet: the surgical discipline referring the patient, the proposed surgery, patient co-morbidities, the lead-time from the first APOC-GSH assessment to surgery, number of visits to APOC-GSH by each patient, the investigations and additional interventions instituted at APOC-GSH. We shall also calculate the proportion of patients that would have likely been cancelled had they not attended APOC-GSH but rather been assessed by an anaesthetist the day before surgery. The record of the APOC-GSH consultation will be documented on a clerking sheet established for use within the clinic (Addendum A). The original form will be included in the patients' file and a duplicate will be stored within the access controlled Department Of Anaesthesia offices at GSH. The duplicate records will be used to obtain the information for the audit. Ethical approval will be sought from the UCT Human Research Ethics Committee for the establishment of the database and retrospective review of the APOC-GSH records on the understanding that patient records would be kept confidential and that the data obtained would be stored in a password protected spreadsheet. Access to the spreadsheet will be limited to the investigators involved and no identifiable patient details will be included. Patients will be counselled as {{to the nature of the}} study and will be expected to submit signed consent forms allowing their records to be reviewed. Patients will be informed that they will not be disadvantaged by refusal to sign the consent form and that the appropriate standard of care will still be applied. No remuneration will be provided for partaking either. Consent will be documented on the consent form specifically designed for use in the APOC-GSH. (Addendum B) Statistical analysis will be performed using an Excel® spreadsheet. Means, medians, rates and percentages will be used to describe the discrete categorical data. Output and future work The audit will provide an objective assessment of the population profile referred to APOC-GSH. It may guide future implementation of APOC-GSH protocol changes and assist with resource allocation depending on the surgical discipline requirements. Patient and surgeon satisfaction ratings may be embarked at a later stage juxtaposed against an adequate assessment in a cost and time conscious manner...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis was the unfortunate {{outcome of a}} widespread disruption in the global financial world. It showed, among other things, the need for both an adequate market stress level assessment and more stringent capital requirements for banks. In this thesis we focus on these two aspects. The thesis opens with a comprehensive introduction and summary of all mathematical and financial terms, models and methods employed {{in the rest of}} the work. In the second part we define different market fear indicators and propose a new overall stress index FIX. The third part covers the valuation and sensitivity analysis of Contingent Convertible bonds (CoCos), a new asset class that emerged due to the new regulatory setting following the {{financial crisis}}. Part II of this thesis focuses on measuring market fear and intraday liquidity. We argue that the "market fear" should not be recognized only by the level of the volatility, but should be measured by a composite indicator, which combines different factors into a single index. In particular, we have focused on three fear factors, which in our opinion; have a significant impact on the overall market stress level. More precisely, we propose to take into account market risk and nervousness using the well-known volatility index VIX. Further, we introduce two new components: LIQ - a market implied liquidity measure; CIX - an index of the degree of herd behavior in a market. Combination of these three leads to the new, overall fear index FIX. First we present the VIX index which is a key measure of market volatility delivered by Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and is originally based on the S&P 500 stock index option prices. The formula for VIX uses prices of all liquid out-of-the-money calls and puts for the front and second month expirations, leading to the 30 -day forward looking volatility estimate. Secondly, we present the new liquidity measure LIQ. Although, several liquidity proxies already exist, these measures are typically defined for a given asset class only or are not unit free. To overcome these drawbacks, we define a new LIQ index, which isolates the liquidity risk in a unit free manner. It assesses the level of liquidity by employing the implied liquidity measure related to bid-ask spreads based on the conic finance theory of bid and ask prices. Conic pricing of vanilla options is performed using distorted expectations, instead of original expectations. For the implementation, concave distortion function from the minmaxvar family, characterized by a single parameter λ, are used. The value of λ for which the difference between the conic finance bid and ask prices and the market bid and ask prices is the smallest, is called the implied liquidity. Since the measure is purely based on option prices, we have a forward looking measure in contrast to many backward looking measures based on historical time series. A short term overall liquidity index LIQ is further constructed in the similar fashion to VIX out of the near- and next term index (or stock) implied liquidities. Subsequently, the herd behavior measure CIX is introduced as a third ingredient of the general panic or fear level. Although it is particularly hard to quantify phenomena which relies on human reactions in specific circumstances, the herd behavior in the financial world is related to the dependency relationship between traded assets. Thus, we make use of the concept of comonotonicity and comonotonic upper bounds for option prices. More precisely, we propose a new herd behavior index CIX as a ratio of VIX and its comonotonic counterpart, where option prices are replaced by their comonotonic upper bounds. This measure allows us to assess to which degree the whole market goes into one direction. The combination of these three leads to the new, overall fear index FIX presented in this thesis. VIX, LIQ and CIX are aggregated to one index, which in a "neutral" situation equals 100. A value of FIX> 100 will reflect a market with a fear level above average, whereas a value of FIX< 100 expresses less fear in the market than average. The theoretical part is followed by several numerical studies in which we apply the measures to real data in the time of the recent financial crisis, i. e. between January 2007 and October 2009, on Dow Jones index (DJX) option data. The results obtained in the numerical calculations clearly indicate the financial troubles within the considered period. VIX and LIQ triplicated its value in a timespan of a few weeks, indicating the culmination of the crisis. Both exhibit also a mean-reverting nature. CIX values furthermore demonstrated the credit crisis around October 2008 as well as smaller issues in the financial world. All three components represent different behavior. VIX gradually increase in response to market disturbances, whereas LIQ and CIX reacts relatively fast exhibiting sharp peaks. On the other hand, VIX and CIX seem to be more sensitive to smaller stress situations, showing peaks also e. g. around financial issues during the summer of 2007. Blending indices which exhibits different behavior should lead to a composite indicator carrying properties of its components. Indeed, results for FIX not only clearly reflects the financial problems round October 2008, but also demonstrates smaller peaks in summer 2007 which can be associated with stressful financial events and shows mean-reverting tendency. Also reaction to market distress seems to be rather immediate. All this confirms our motivation, that market fear should be recognized by a composite indicator, which combines various indices capturing different risks in different ways. In a supplementary study, we focus only on the LIQ measure in a high frequency data framework. The goal is to investigate the potential time-of-the-day and day-of-the-week effect of this new liquidity index. For that reason, the DJX index LIQ has been calculated every 5 minutes in period between August 6, 2012 and August 8, 2013. Results show, that Mondays and Fridays are, on average, the least liquid days of the week. Furthermore, considering the intra-day evolution of the LIQ, we observed that the beginning and the end of the session is characterized with a decrease of the liquidity. The study confirms the U-shaped daily pattern, which is in line with previous findings reported in the literature. Despite many contributions, there is still room for further improvement in the research in the framework of fear indices. We recognize potential improvements in the way of aggregating the fear factors, study on behavior of the historical time series of all the risk measures and discussion on the most liquid moments. The above mentioned financial crisis led to the advent of a new financial instrument - contingent convertible bonds, CoCos in short. CoCos are characterized with a loss absorption capacity with the aim of preventing or limiting the use of taxpayer's money in future bank rescue operations. During the crisis many financial institutions have been bailed-out by governments with the tax payers' money. To avoid in the future again the situation that the public finance would have to rescue banks, more regulatory capital has been demanded. This led to more stringent capital requirements for banks proposed in September 2010 by the Basel committee and finally resulted in the Basel III framework. Revised in July 2011 Basel III requirements allowed CoCo bonds to be part of the Tier 2 and Additional Tier 1 (AT 1) in the capital. Since then banks have been embracing this new asset class. One can model CoCos was in a traditional (one-parameter) Black-Scholes framework assuming a constant volatility. However, increasing interest in the CoCos opens the quest for more appropriate and sophisticated pricing models. Thus, in this thesis we employ the stochastic volatility, five parameter Heston model as a more sophisticated method to describe the stock market dynamics. In particular, we investigate the impact of the volatility skew on the pricing of CoCo bonds. The third part of the thesis starts with explaining the anatomy of a CoCo. A CoCo can be understood as a bond issued by a financial institution that is converted into a predetermined number of shares or (fully/partially) written down as soon as the issuer gets into a less viable state, i. e. upon a trigger event. There exist different kinds of triggers: market based trigger, accounting trigger and regulatory trigger. The valuation of CoCos boils down to the quantification of the trigger probability and the expected loss suffered by the investors in case of conversion or write down. Apart from taking into account this loss absorption risk, coupon cancellation and extension risk are other risk factors in the CoCo design and are becoming also important in the pricing. There exist at least two ways of CoCos valuation - structural and market implied models. In this thesis we follow two market implied models: a credit derivatives approach and an equity derivatives approach. They are characterized by the fact that the derivation is based on market data such as share prices, credit default swaps (CDS) and implied volatilities. The credit derivatives approach model, is a rather simple model: it does not take into account neither the risk associated with the coupons nor coupons <b>cancellation.</b> For this <b>reason</b> we refer to this model as a "rule of thumb" model. The equity derivatives approach goes one step further and uses the coupon structure of the CoCo when calculating its theoretical price. The thesis section related to the research on CoCos contains several numerical studies, based on the Tier 2 (T 2) 10 NC 7 5 / 8 % CoCo issued by Barclays in 2012 and maturing on 21. 11. 2022 (ISIN: US 06740 L 8 C 27). Both, option and CDS data are used for the Black-Scholes and the Heston model calibration. Here, the Heston model demonstrates its preponderance, yielding a better overall model fit to the|$|R
