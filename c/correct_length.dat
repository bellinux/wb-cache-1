25|$|Because {{the three}} {{effective}} lengths (good length, bouncer and yorker) are all interspersed by lengths {{that are easy}} for the batsman to hit, control of length is an important discipline for a fast bowler. In addition to all the above variables, batsmen control how far out of the crease they face, further complicating the bowler's task of <b>correct</b> <b>length</b> estimation. Spin bowlers {{on the other hand}} are almost always aiming for the good length, but need a much finer control of flight and line to be effective.|$|E

There is no <b>correct</b> <b>length</b> of time for intercourse to last, but generally, premature ejaculation is thought to occur when ejaculation occurs in under 2 minutes {{from the time of}} the insertion of the penis.

25|$|One {{approach}} for exhaustive enumeration goes as follows. Loop construction begins by aligning all possible fragments to overlap {{with the three}} residues at the N terminus of the loop (the anchor point). Then all possible choices for a second fragment are aligned to (all possible choices of) the first fragment, ensuring that the last three residues of the first fragment overlap with the first three residues of the second fragment. This ensures that the fragment chain forms realistic angles both within the fragment and between fragments. This is then repeated until a loop with the <b>correct</b> <b>length</b> of residues is constructed.|$|E

2500|$|Surgical {{procedures}} are also {{performed in the}} sheep industry to help prevention, {{one of which is}} controversial due to the invasive nature. Tail docking to the <b>correct</b> <b>length</b> will reduce the amount of staining in the breech area due to urine and fecal matter. Pizzle dropping is a procedure that severs the connective tissue between the penis and the body. Not only does it reduce the incidence of relentless pizzle rot in sheep, but it decreases the amount of urine staining on the belly of the sheep. This procedure can greatly reduce the occurrence of flystrike on the belly area. Mulesing is an animal husbandry procedure that has currently faced much opposition throughout its practice. Large scissors are used to cut off the backs of the sheep's thigh region. This procedure is usually carried out by untrained farmers without the use of any analgesia. It flattens out the wrinkles around the breech of the sheep, reducing the places where moisture collects affecting the skin of the sheep resulting in liquid protein exudate which is attractive to Lucilia cuprina. Mulesing also increases the amount of bare skin around the vulva during the healing process, reducing urine staining and amount of flystrike. This procedure does cause pain, but since it is considered the most effective method to prevent breech strike, it is seemingly justifiable. Mulesing is as effective as breeding sheep for less wrinkle (score 2) which are resistant to flystrike. Mulesing is a good prevention until breeding can remove the need for the operation in flystrike prevention ...|$|E

60|$|The {{confusion}} {{between the}} standards of a short story and {{the standards of}} the novel which leads at last to these--what shall I call them?--Westminster Gazettisms?--about the <b>correct</b> <b>length</b> to which the novelist should aspire, leads also to all kinds of absurd condemnations and exactions upon matters of method and style. The underlying fallacy is always this: the assumption that the novel, like the story, aims at a single, concentrated impression. From that comes a fertile growth of error. Constantly one finds in the reviews of works of fiction the complaint that this, that or the other thing in a novel is irrelevant. Now it is the easiest thing, and most fatal thing, to become irrelevant in a short story. A short story should go to its point as a man flies from a pursuing tiger: he pauses not for the daisies in his path, or to note the pretty moss on the tree he climbs for safety. But the novel by comparison is like breakfasting in the open air on a summer morning; nothing is irrelevant if the waiter's mood is happy, and the tapping of the thrush upon the garden path, or the petal of apple-blossom that floats down into my coffee, is as relevant as the egg I open or the bread and butter I bite. And all sorts of things that inevitably mar the tense illusion which is the aim of the short story--the introduction, for example, of the author's personality--any comment that seems to admit that, after all, fiction is fiction, a change in manner between part and part, burlesque, parody, invective, all such thing's are not necessarily wrong in the novel. Of course, all these things may fail in their effect; they may jar, hinder, irritate, and all are difficult to do well; but it is no artistic merit to evade a difficulty any more than it is a merit in a hunter to refuse even the highest of fences. Nearly all the novels that have, by the lapse of time, reached an assured position of recognised greatness, are not only saturated in the personality of the author, but have in addition quite unaffected personal outbreaks. The least successful instance the one that is made the text against all such first-personal interventions, is, of course, Thackeray. But I think the trouble with Thackeray is not that he makes first-personal interventions, but that he does so with a curious touch of dishonesty. I agree with the late Mrs. Craigie that there was something profoundly vulgar about Thackeray. It was a sham thoughtful, sham man-of-the-world pose he assumed; it is an aggressive, conscious, challenging person astride before a fire, and a little distended by dinner and a sense of social and literary precedences, who uses the first person in Thackeray's novels. It isn't the real Thackeray; it isn't a frank man who looks you in the eyes and bares his soul and demands your sympathy. That is a criticism of Thackeray, but it isn't a condemnation of intervention.|$|E

40|$|Fillet {{weight is}} an {{economically}} important trait in Nile tilapia production for the European market which asks for fish with average body weights {{of at least}} 700 g. Genetic parameters to design or optimize breeding programs for these body weights are lacking. In an earlier study we showed that high phenotypic correlations exist between body measurements and fillet weight and low phenotypic correlations exist between body measurements and fillet yield. To evaluate the potential of mass selection for fillet traits, however, genetic parameters are required. The aim {{of the current study}} was to estimate genetic parameters for body weight, fillet weight, fillet yield and body measurements. Therefore, slaughter data was collected on 1884 pedigreed Nile tilapias. Measurements of body weight, <b>length,</b> width, <b>corrected</b> (=fillet) <b>length</b> and head length were taken on each fish. Filleting machines were used to fillet fish and measurements of fillet weight, fillet yield and head weight were collected. Subsequently, genetic parameters were estimated. Heritabilities were 0. 26 for body weight, 0. 24 for fillet weight and 0. 12 for fillet yield. The genetic correlation between body weight and fillet weight was 0. 99 and between body weight and fillet yield 0. 74. The genetic correlation between fillet weight and fillet yield was 0. 81. Genetic correlations between fillet weight and body measurements were 0. 89 for length, 0. 70 for head length, 0. 94 for width and 0. 91 for <b>corrected</b> <b>length.</b> Genetic correlations between fillet yield and body measurements were 0. 62 for length, 0. 47 for head length, 0. 98 for width and 0. 60 for <b>corrected</b> <b>length.</b> The potential of mass selection aiming to improve fillet weight was evaluated by a number of selection indexes. The accuracy of a selection index including only body weight indicated that in this way almost the same amount of the selection response could be achieved compared to what hypothetical direct selection for fillet weight would. The use of only width in the selection index would result in 8. 5 % lower selection response than the use of body weight. We conclude that body weight is the best predictor for fillet weight compared to body measurement...|$|R
