5|$|Cold {{seawater}} {{is used in}} the Seawater Greenhouse to both {{cool and}} humidify the interior of greenhouse-like structure. The cooling <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> effective that not only do the plants inside benefit from reduced transpiration, but dew collects {{on the outside of the}} structure and can easily be collected by gutters.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation is {{a normal}} part of the human immune response, whereby leukocytes (white blood cells), {{including}} neutrophils (white blood cells that specialize in causing inflammation), gather, and chemokines (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. Inflammation interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause the proliferation of inflammatory cells into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, the inflammation continues for an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, inflammation in DPB <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> severe that nodules containing inflammatory cells form in the walls of the bronchioles. The presence of inflammation and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess mucus, which must be coughed up as sputum. The combination of inflammation, nodule development, infection, mucus, and frequent cough contributes to the breathing difficulties in DPB.|$|E
5|$|Outside Australia it {{has become}} naturalised in South Africa, Tanzania, Italy, Portugal, Sardinia, India, Indonesia and New Zealand. It is present in California as a garden escapee, but is not {{considered}} to be naturalised there. In South Africa, where it had been introduced between 1858 and 1865 for dune stabilization and tannin production, it had spread along waterways into forest, mountain and lowland fynbos, and borderline areas between fynbos and karoo. The gall-forming wasp Trichilogaster signiventris has been introduced in South Africa for biological control and has reduced the capacity of trees to reproduce throughout their range. The eggs are laid by adult wasps into buds of flower heads in the summer, before hatching in May and June when the larvae induce the formation of the grape-like galls and prevent flower development. The galls <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> heavy that branches break under their weight. In addition, the introduction in 2001 of the acacia seed weevil Melanterius compactus has also proved effective.|$|E

25|$|The Space Shuttle generates 180dB {{of noise}} around its base. To combat this, NASA {{developed}} a sound suppression system which can flow water at rates up to 900,000 gallons per minute (57m3/s) onto the launch pad. The water reduces {{the noise level}} from 180dB down to 142dB (the design requirement is 145dB). Without the sound suppression system, acoustic waves reflect off of the launch pad towards the rocket, vibrating the sensitive payload and crew. These acoustic waves <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> severe that they can destroy the rocket.|$|E
25|$|A {{control system}} must always have some {{robustness}} property. A robust controller {{is such that}} its properties do not change much if applied to a system slightly different from the mathematical one used for its synthesis. This specification is important, as no real physical system truly behaves like the series of differential equations used to represent it mathematically. Typically a simpler mathematical model is chosen {{in order to simplify}} calculations, otherwise, the true system dynamics <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> complicated that a complete model is impossible.|$|E

25|$|Cases of {{traumatic}} insemination between {{animals of different species}} will sometimes provoke a possibly lethal immune reaction. A female Cimex lectularius traumatically inseminated {{by a male}} C. hemipterus will swell up at the site of insemination as the immune system responds to male ejaculates. In the process, the female's lifespan is reduced. In some cases, this immune reaction <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> massive as to be almost immediately fatal. A female Hesperocimex sonorensis will swell up, blacken, and die within 24–48 hours after being traumatically inseminated by a male H. cochimiensis.|$|E
25|$|In {{stationary}} organisms, such as plants, exploitative competition plays a {{much larger}} role than interference competition because individuals are rooted to a specific area and utilise resources in their immediate surroundings. Saplings will compete for light, most {{of which will be}} blocked and utilised by taller trees. The saplings can be easily out-competed by larger members of their own species, {{which is one of the}} reasons why seed dispersal distances <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> large. Seeds that germinate in close proximity to the parents are very likely to be out-competed and die.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes sports {{injuries}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> {{severe that}} they lead to death. In 2010 48 youths died from sports injuries. The {{leading causes of}} death in youth sports are sudden cardiac arrest, concussion, heat illness and external sickling. Cardiac-related deaths are usually due to an undiagnosed cardiovascular disorder. Trauma to the head, neck and spine can also be lethal. Among young American athletes, {{more than half of}} trauma-related deaths take place among football players, with track and field, lacrosse, baseball, boxing, and soccer also having relatively high fatality rates.|$|E

25|$|Cholera is an {{infection}} of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Symptoms may range from none, to mild, to severe. The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days. Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur. Diarrhea <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. This may result in sunken eyes, cold skin, decreased skin elasticity, and wrinkling of the hands and feet. The dehydration may result in the skin turning bluish. Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure.|$|E
25|$|While California's wine regions can be {{generally}} {{classified as a}} Mediterranean climate, there are also regions with more continental dry climates. Proximity to the Pacific or bays as well as unobstructed access to the cool currents that come off them dictate the relative coolness of the wine region. Areas surrounded by mountain barriers, like some parts of Sonoma and Napa counties will be warmer {{due to the lack}} of this cooling influence. The soil types and landforms of California vary greatly, having been influenced by the plate tectonics of the North American and Pacific Plates. In some areas the soils <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> diverse that vineyards will establish blocks of the same vine variety planted on different soils for purpose of identifying different blending components. This diversity is one of the reasons why California has so many different and distinct American Viticultural Areas.|$|E
25|$|Horcruxes {{made from}} inanimate objects are {{extremely}} difficult to destroy. They cannot be destroyed by conventional means such as smashing, breaking, or burning. To be destroyed, a Horcrux must suffer damage so severe that repair through magical means would be impossible. Very few magical objects or spells are powerful enough to achieve this (mentioned and used were the Fiendfyre, Gryffindor's Sword and Basilisk fang, the last two only being able to inflict such damage due to the basilisk venom permeating them both). Once a Horcrux is irreparably damaged, the fragment of soul within it is destroyed. A Horcrux can be deliberately magically undone only if the creator goes {{through a process of}} deep remorse for the murder committed to create the Horcrux. The pain of this remorse <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> excruciating that the process may kill the creator.|$|E
