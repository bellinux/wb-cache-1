5|$|After {{more than}} 60 years of {{continuous}} operation, the Cacchio family {{decided to sell}} the Theatre. Rather than sell to real estate developers, the Cacchios preferred to transfer the property to the Rosendale Theatre <b>Collective,</b> a nonprofit formed in late 2009 {{for the sole purpose}} of buying and preserving the Theatre. The group spent months raising funds for a down payment on the building, with the bulk of its money coming from small individual donations. About 60 fundraisers were held, and a large grant was provided by PepsiCo after the Theatre <b>Collective</b> ran a successful social networking campaign for the April 2010 Pepsi Refresh Project. The Cacchios transferred ownership of the property to the Theatre <b>Collective</b> on August19, 2010. Since its purchase, the Theatre has had several equipment upgrades, including a move to digital cinema.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the importance of "hybrid <b>collectives</b> " in the design process. In the first part, the active role of technologies and broadly speaking of non humans, in the construction and the functioning of those <b>collectives,</b> is emphasized: they allow heterogeneous actors to coordinate their projects; they contribute to the emergence and the transformation of social identities; they help to frame the spatial and temporal settings in which these <b>collectives</b> exist and act; they are directly engaged in action and cognition. For all these reasons non humans are to be considered as strategic players in the dynamics and the organization of these <b>collectives,</b> and in particular of design communities. Symmetrically, the very existence of hybrid <b>collectives</b> induces a new vision of human agency, that must be considered as diversified and variable: needs, demands, expectations, feelings, capacities of action and cognition depend on the socio-technical configurations of their environment, i. e. of the <b>collectives</b> they are part from. Finally some general lessons for participatory design and information ecology are drawn from the recognition of the centrality of hybrid <b>collectives</b> in our advanced societies.

50|$|An {{unprecedented}} area of {{land was}} collectivised during the anarchist period of Aragon's history. According to estimates, {{as many as}} 5 to 7 million people {{either directly or indirectly}} facilitated this land collectivisation. During the height of collectivisation, there were 400 <b>collectives</b> in Aragon, 700 in the Levant and 300 in Castile.Frank Mintz estimates that there were 450 <b>collectives</b> in Aragon and 503 agricultural <b>collectives</b> in Levant. The 450 Aragonese <b>collectives</b> involved 300,000 collectivists, while the agricultural <b>collectives</b> in Levant only involved 130,000 people. Especially contrasted with the considerable peasant resistance during the collectivisation of farms in the Soviet Union, the voluntary collectivisation of land on such a mass scale by both the landless and the land-owners would seem somewhat odd. The Spanish Communist Party, one of the opponents of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo, accused the columns of the anarcho-syndicalist CNT union of enforcing collectivisation at gunpoint, a viewpoint which is sometimes repeated by some historians of the Spanish Civil War.|$|R
