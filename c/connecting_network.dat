25|$|The {{size of the}} Cross of Sacrifice, a {{standard}} Commission structure used for cemeteries with over 40 graves, varies according {{to the number of}} burials in a cemetery. For this cemetery, a Type-A Cross, around 4 metres wide at the base and 6 metres high, would be used. Carved from Massangies, a French limestone, the shaft of the cross alone would weigh four tonnes, while the entire raised stone terrace would weigh many more tonnes. To support the weight of the Cross and the raised terrace on which it would stand, special foundations of twenty-six vertical 7-metre deep concrete piles were prepared, each capable of supporting ten tonnes, four of which would support the Cross itself. A <b>connecting</b> <b>network</b> was also built between the piles to ensure the load was spread evenly. The raised terrace includes ramps to allow access by wheelchair, and bastions for flower displays.|$|E

40|$|This work {{provides}} {{new insights}} on {{the convergence of}} a locally <b>connected</b> <b>network</b> of pulse coupled oscillator (PCOs) (i. e., a bio-inspired model for communication networks) to synchronous and desynchronous states, and their implication {{in terms of the}} decentralized synchronization and scheduling in communication networks. Bio-inspired techniques have been advocated by many as fault-tolerant and scalable alternatives to produce self-organization in communication networks. The PCO dynamics in particular have been the source of inspiration for many network synchronization and scheduling protocols. However, their convergence properties, especially in locally <b>connected</b> <b>networks,</b> have not been fully understood, prohibiting the migration into mainstream standards. This work provides further results on the convergence of PCOs in locally <b>connected</b> <b>networks</b> and the achievable convergence accuracy under propagation delays. For synchronization, almost sure convergence is proved for $ 3 $ nodes and accuracy results are obtained for general locally <b>connected</b> <b>networks</b> whereas, for scheduling (or desynchronization), results are derived for locally <b>connected</b> <b>networks</b> with mild conditions on the overlapping set of maximal cliques.
