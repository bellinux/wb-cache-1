5|$|Riesling is {{considered}} one of the grape varieties that best expresses the terroir of the place where it is grown. It is particularly well suited for slate and sandy <b>clay</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
5|$|The site can be {{generally}} {{divided into three}} broad areas, the site core, a North Zone and an East Zone. The North Zone is separated from the site core by a wide depression containing <b>clay</b> <b>soil</b> that may {{have served as a}} reservoir for the city. Several quarries have been identified on the northern and southern edges of this depression.|$|E
50|$|Alkalinity {{problems}} are {{more pronounced in}} <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> than in loamy, silty or sandy <b>soils.</b> The <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> containing montmorillonite or smectite (swelling clays) are more subject to alkalinity problems than illite or kaolinite <b>clay</b> <b>soils.</b> The {{reason is that the}} former types of clay have larger specific surface areas (i.e. the surface area of the soil particles divided by their volume) and higher cation exchange capacity (CEC).|$|R

40|$|The red <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> {{which are}} {{widespread}} in China {{are known to}} be highly sensitive to drought during the dry season but the origin of this high sensitivity to drought remains unclear. Several red <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> were selected in the Hunan province for study. We studied their basic physico-chemical properties and clay mineralogy, their structure and shrinkage properties, as well as their water retention properties. Results show that the amount of water available between - 330 and - 15, 000 hPa water potential is consistent with that recorded in many other <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> from {{different parts of the world}} and thus cannot explain the high sensitivity of the red <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> to drought. This high sensitivity to drought might be related to the high proportion of poorly available water which was characterized by the amount of available water between - 3, 300 and - 15, 000 hPa water potential. Comparison with <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> located in different parts of the world and for which the sensitivity to drought was not identified showed that this proportion of poorly available water is indeed much higher in the red <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> studied than in <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> representing a large range of both clay content and mineralogy. This specific behavior of the red <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> studied is thought to be related to the history of their parent materials: these materials are continental sediments which may have been submitted to great hydric stress, thus leading to strongly consolidated soils with consequences such as a high proportion of poorly available water, strong aggregation and weak shrinkage properties...|$|R
5|$|Dorset's diverse {{geography}} ensures it has {{an assortment}} of rivers, although a moderate annual rainfall coupled with rolling hills, means most are typically lowland in nature. Much of the county drains into three rivers, the Frome, Piddle and Stour which all flow to the sea in a south-easterly direction. The Frome and Piddle are chalk streams but the Stour, which rises in Wiltshire to the north, has its origins in <b>clay</b> <b>soil.</b> The River Avon, which flows mainly through Wiltshire and Hampshire, enters Dorset {{towards the end of}} its journey at Christchurch Harbour. The rivers Axe and Yeo, which principally drain the counties of Devon and Somerset respectively, have their sources in the north-west of the county. In the south-west, a number of small rivers run into the sea along the Dorset coastline; most notable of these are the Char, Brit, Bride and Wey.|$|E
5|$|It also tolerates {{a variety}} of soil conditions. Although young {{specimens}} perform best when planted {{in a mixture of}} peat and either sand or perlite, P.atriplicifolia can thrive in sandy, chalky, or loamy soil, or heavy <b>clay</b> <b>soil</b> with sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range of soil pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P.atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.|$|E

3000|$|The <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> {{exhibited}} a best fit line slope (constant A) equals to 6.0  Eq. (11) {{which is much}} lower than the 13.9, Eq. (12) revealed for the silty soils. This indicates that the ([...] S_u OCR/σ^'_v) term is more sensitive to ([...] q_c - σ^'_v)/σ^'_v variations in the silts than in the <b>clay</b> <b>soils.</b> On the other hand, the <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> indicated a best fit line y-intercept (B) of 8.1 which is much lower than 20.7 derived from analysis for the silt soils.|$|R

25|$|The low {{thickness}} of geosynthetics, {{as compared to}} their natural soil counterparts, is an advantage insofar as light weight on the subgrade, less airspace used, and avoidance of quarried sand, gravel, and <b>clay</b> <b>soil</b> materials.|$|E
25|$|The {{broad bean}} has high plant hardiness; it can {{withstand}} harsh and cold climates. Unlike most legumes, the broad bean {{can be grown}} in soils with high salinity, {{as well as in}} <b>clay</b> <b>soil.</b> However, it does prefer to grow in rich loams.|$|E
25|$|The late {{discovery}} of birch documents, {{as well as}} their amazing state of preservation, is explained by a deep culture layer in Novgorod (up to eight meters, or 25 feet) and heavy waterlogged <b>clay</b> <b>soil</b> which prevents the access of oxygen. Serious excavations in Novgorod started only in 1932, although some attempts had been made in the 19th century.|$|E
3000|$|The S [...] u [...] values {{varied from}} 30.3 to 460  kPa in the <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> and from 16 to 252  kPa in the silt soils with average values of 129 and 91  kPa respectively. The consistency of most <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> could be {{described}} as firm to very stiff with few soft and hard samples. The values of empirical cone factor N [...] k   were determined for the soil types considered {{and found to}} vary {{over a wide range}} of 35.1 to 55.6 with average values of 37.5 for <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> and 44.1 for silt soils.|$|R

25|$|There {{is also a}} small lake, {{known as}} 'The Trap', which is stocked with coarse fish. A German Messerschmitt bomber crashed into the Trap during World War II, shot down by {{anti-aircraft}} fire after going off course following a bombing run over Liverpool. The land is primarily heavy <b>clay</b> <b>soil.</b> Etna Park, {{which is just a}} short walk from the town centre, is part of the Heritage Trail walk in the area.|$|E
25|$|Although most of {{the land}} around Mount Magnet has the heavy <b>clay</b> <b>soil</b> and Acacia aneura (Mulga) scrub common {{throughout}} semi-arid Western Australia, the area on which B.rosserae occurs is unusual in having deep yellow sand and laterite. It occurs there with mallee Eucalyptus species, over open heath of Grevillea, Hakea, Leptospermum, Melaleuca, Cryptandra and Triodia species. Thus the flora is more like that found on the Swan Coastal Plain than the arid zone in which it occurs.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{earliest}} history of Coventry, but prior to its existence there were settlements in nearby Corley and Baginton, which came to be occupied by the Romans, and later by Saxon invaders. These locations were probably chosen because they lay on early trackways, and were situated on light, easily worked soil free from thick forest and undergrowth; unlike the heavy <b>clay</b> <b>soil,</b> covered in marsh and forest near the north-eastern reaches of the Forest of Arden on which Coventry would rise.|$|E

30|$|<b>Clay</b> <b>soils</b> were {{collected}} from Ajora, Tunto and Lalo sits. The collected <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> were packed, labelled and transported to the drying place. The <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> were combined with equal proportion and dry in the sun for 7  days with guidance of the local potters. The clay was grounded with wooden mortar and pestle and screened with 0.5  mm sieve size. The saw dust was collected from local furniture manufacturers. After drying for 7  days it was processed through wooden mortar and pestle like clay. The saw dust was screened with 0.5  mm opening sieve. Grog was grounded with mortar, pestle and sieved using 0.5  mm sieve size.|$|R
25|$|A fresh {{pocket of}} black <b>clay</b> <b>soil</b> was {{discovered}} in the preceding winter and the whole Adelaide wicket area had been re-laid. A dispute between the cricket authorities and the local football players also meant that little of the Australian game was played on its undisturbed surface {{during the winter of}} 1974. The question about the Adelaide surface for the Fifth Test was whether it would be a pitch in the old tradition of batting excellence or a wicket whose unsettled nature would lead to bowling supremacy throughout the game.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the area}} {{would not have}} another major city state, and {{eventually}} it was dominated by the Aztecs from Tenochtitlan by the 15th century. It is from their language, Nahuatl, that the name of Tlalpan, would come {{to be used for}} the largest village in the area. It means “over the earth” and refers to roads that converged here, linking Tenochtitlan with points south. The borough’s glyph or symbol is the one given to the historic center by the Aztecs, a footprint over a symbol for <b>clay</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{many generations}} {{the main source}} of {{employment}} in the parish was agriculture. The village lands were divided into two parts—infield and outfield. The infield was cultivated for the growing of crops and the outfield was pasture. Crops grown included wheat, barley and peas. Turnips were a successful later addition. The scrubland and <b>clay</b> <b>soil</b> of the parish meant lots of hard work re-claiming land, drainage work, and liming. Wheat and barley were taken by cart to Dalkeith, Peebles and Melrose for the making of bread and beer, and carts returning from Dalkeith brought lime for the soil.|$|E
40|$|The {{horizontal}} leaching {{technique has}} been developed for the reclamation of salinised, heavy <b>clay</b> <b>soils.</b> It enables excess salt {{to be removed from}} <b>clay</b> <b>soils</b> that are deep enough (deeper than 1 m) and have low permeability (less than 0. 1 m/day).

25|$|Although the <b>clay</b> <b>soil</b> is {{not very}} fertile, the high {{rainfall}} and warm weather mean that the island is densely forested throughout. Native plants include the world's southernmost dense forest of podocarps (southern conifers) and hardwoods such as rātā and kāmahi in the lowland areas with mānuka shrubland at higher elevations. The trees {{are thought to have}} become established here since the last ice age from seeds brought across the strait by seabirds, which would explain why the beech trees that are so common in New Zealand, but whose seeds are dispersed by the wind rather than birds, are not found on Stewart Island.|$|E
25|$|Surrey {{had little}} {{political}} or economic significance in the Middle Ages. It was not the main power-base of any important aristocratic family, nor the seat of a bishopric. Its agricultural wealth was limited by the infertility of most of its soils, while urban development, excepting the London suburb of Southwark, was sapped by the overshadowing predominance of London and {{by the lack of}} direct access to the sea. Population pressure in the 12th and 13th centuries initiated the gradual clearing of the Weald, the forest spanning the borders of Surrey, Sussex and Kent, which had hitherto been left undeveloped due to the difficulty of farming on its heavy <b>clay</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} and famous features of the Lord's ground is the significant slope across the field. The north-west side of the playing surface is 2.5metres (8ft 2 ins) higher than the south-east side. This slope causes appreciable deviation in bounce of {{the ball on the}} pitch, making it easier to move the ball in to right-handed batsmen when bowling from the Pavilion End, and easier to move it away when bowling from the Nursery End. The outfield was notorious for becoming waterlogged, resulting in considerable loss of play due to rainfall, until <b>clay</b> <b>soil</b> was relaid with sand during the winter of 2002–2003.|$|E
