50|$|The 1968 Imperial {{was little}} {{changed from the}} {{previous}} year. The grille changed to a brightly chromed one with thin horizontal bars, split in the middle by vertical chrome and a round Imperial Eagle badge. The <b>cornering</b> <b>lamp</b> lenses were now covered by matching grilles. At the rear, the horizontal bars over the taillights remained, but the gas filler door pull was changed to a cast metal eagle instead of a round knob containing a plastic emblem. All 1968s came with a Federally mandated energy absorbing steering column. The base level model was cancelled after only one year and the four-door sedan {{became part of the}} Crown level of trim. This was also the last year for the Imperial convertible. A total of 15,367 Imperials were sold in 1968.|$|E
5000|$|The bodystyle was a 4-door hardtop, but it wasn't a true hardtop, using a [...] "B" [...] pillar {{between the}} front and rear {{passenger}} compartments, and instead it used frameless doors. The Inspire was available in two versions; a shorter and narrower version badged as the Accord Inspire, with a G20A 2.0L engine in compliance with Japanese vehicle size requirements for cars classified as [...] "compact". The CB5 Inspire was offered in 3 trim levels, the base AZ-I with manual transmission, AG-I with fog lamps and optional sunroof as well as central locking, and the top spec luxury AX-I with leather upholstery, more safety features and full cruise control as well as power seats. A longer and wider version with the 5 cylinder G25A 2.5L engine debuted in early 1992, similar in dimensions to the first generation Legend. The larger CC2-CC3 Inspire was a mild refresh of the first CB5 Inspire, featuring updated full-width boot lamps (the updated Vigor had conventional single lamp units) with less chrome, larger bumpers with new wrap-around <b>cornering</b> <b>lamp</b> design (instead of the optional separate units like the CB5) and mesh alloy wheels. Following the 1992 refresh, the Inspire offered fewer trim levels and the inline-5 received upgrades (power was up from 118KW to 140KW). The CC2 Inspire shared more features with the Acura Vigor under a 'wide-body' marketing campaign with minor differences.|$|E
5000|$|North American market sales {{started in}} 1983 for the 1984 model {{year as the}} [...] "Toyota Van" [...] with styling shared with the MasterAce Surf. The 2.0-liter 3Y-U EFI (...) came at launch, but was {{replaced}} with the 2.2-liter 4Y-E engine with [...] for the 1986 model year facelift. Rear-wheel drive versions were sold in the United States between 1983 and 1989, while four-wheel drive models were sold between 1987 and 1989. The four-wheel drive models came with skid plates, with manual transmission models including a transfer case with low and high ranges (automatic models lacked a low range). All trim levels starting in 1986 had a <b>cornering</b> <b>lamp</b> system. Toyota's advertising campaign referred to the passenger vans (DLX and LE trim levels) as the [...] "Wonderwagon" [...] while the CRG trim level {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Cargo Van". Deluxe and LE (Limited Edition) versions were offered as well as an ice maker/refrigerator between the front seats.

LE models had color matched bumpers and front grille along with power mirrors, chrome headlight bezels, and chrome Toyota emblems. Base models came with black bumpers and grill with white Toyota emblems. Base models have the reverse lights incorporated into the tail light assembly whereas the LE models had them incorporated into the rear hatch. In 1986, a special EXPO86 version was available in Canada only. The 1986 model year Espirit model was finished in a unique light blue color with a white wave pattern on the lower half on the side profile. A unique bronze colored plaque was affixed to the B-pillar behind the drivers and passengers doors that said [...] "Spirit of 86" [...] inside a globe.|$|E

50|$|As {{with the}} 1988-1991 models, the Grand Marquis was {{available}} in base-trim GS and deluxe-trim LS models; LS models are distinguished by front <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps.</b> From 1992 onward, the Grand Marquis was produced solely as a four-door sedan, as the Colony Park station wagon was discontinued. Ford's Keyless Entry System became optional on lower trim packages, and standard on upper trim packages.|$|R
5000|$|Above the {{standard}} LTD Crown Victoria, Ford offered an Interior Luxury Package; in 1986, the option package became the LTD Crown Victoria LX.

5000|$|Both {{the front}} and rear styling of the {{limousine}} and formal limousine was revised for 1987. A new grille, header moldings and composite headlights with wraparound bezel and <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps</b> were used. Rear styling now featured elongated quarter extensions against which the taillamps, bumper and bumper trim fascia fit flush. Also new was grooved six-inch wide rocker molding made of stainless steel/aluminum composite with a single-rib accent grrove. For 1987, new hydro-elastic engine mounts were used to further isolate powertrain vibration.|$|R
60|$|They {{turned away}} {{down into a}} little lane where an old, white, timbered cottage presided ghostly at the corner.

A chafer buzzed by, a small black cat played with its tail on some steps in a recess. Nobody passed.|$|R
5000|$|The 1970 models {{differed}} only in minor ways. The grill pattern {{changed to}} a larger eggcrate design; the front <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps</b> were now rectangular instead of the [...] "shark gill" [...] pattern of 1969 models. A wide chrome strip was added at the rocker panels, vinyl side trim was made optional, and (for this year only) the fender skirts were gone. It was the final year for the Crown series; afterwards Imperial would have only two models, a LeBaron hardtop sedan and coupe. 11,822 of the 1970s were produced.|$|R

50|$|For 1983, the Executive {{used the}} {{standard}} LeBaron grille (as {{shown on the}} 1982 prototype models as well), while 1984 and 1985 utilized a slightly more vertical waterfall grill (borrowed from the New Yorker) that featured a heavier cap and narrow chrome extensions running beneath the headlights. 1984 and 1985 models also received wrap-around tail lamps (from standard LeBaron models), versus the envelope styling on the 1983. For Executive's final year, the 1986 models used the re-designed LeBaron tail end, featuring new tail lamps and deck lid. Up front, Executive still utilized the New Yorker grille but the front fender-mounted <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps</b> were discontinued.|$|R
500|$|The {{facelift}} of the Citroën C3 Picasso appeared {{first at}} the 2012 Paris Motor Show on 27 September. The new eMyWay SatNav system, located on the central console, is more functional than the previous model, allowing connection to a reversing camera (available as an extra), which displays on the console screen. LED daytime running lamps and fog <b>lamps</b> with built-in <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps,</b> which illuminate the roadside, are also non-standard features on the facelifted C3 Picasso. In addition, Citroën has added two new exterior paint colour options; [...] "Pearlescent white" [...] and [...] "Ink blue" [...] to the vehicle.

50|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the two-door Continental Mark VII, the Lincoln Continental was given a styling update for the 1984 model year. The body was fitted with flush-fitting front and rear bumpers and revised taillamps. While not fitted with the composite headlights of the Mark VII, the front fascia of the Continental was revised with an angled grille flanked by recessed quad headlamps and larger wrap-around marker lights incorporating <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps.</b> On the inside, the doors and dashboard were fitted with satin-black trim (accented with low-gloss genuine walnut veneer for the 1986 model year only). Other changes through the rest of production run were primarily limited to paint colors and upholstery pattern details. All models were also fitted with Ford's door-mounted Keyless Entry System, {{not to be confused with}} a Remote Keyless Entry System.|$|R
50|$|It {{was time}} for another {{facelift}} in 1964 and really a minor one. New up front was a bi-angular grille that formed a V-shape along both its vertical and horizontal planes. The main horizontal grille bar was now carried around the body sides. Outer grille extension panels again housed the parking and <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps.</b> It was the 17th consecutive year for the Cadillac tailfins with a new fine-blade design carrying on the tradition. Equipment features were same as in 1963 for the most part. Comfort Control, a completely automatic {{heating and air conditioning}} system controlled by a dial thermostat on the instrument panel, was introduced as an industry first. The engine was bumped to 429 cuin L OHV V8 for 1964. 340 hp (254 kW) was the result.|$|R
5000|$|... 1987 saw a new {{front-end}} design including revised <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps</b> {{in front}} and one-piece composite headlamps flanked a trapezoid-shaped grille with a bold egg-crate texture. Elongated fender caps were in back - upping the overall length by {{an inch and a}} half, but much more dramatic in appearance with new wrap-around tail lamps. This new 3-sided tail lamp style was inspired by a design used on the 1977 DeVille. Unlike the new one-piece headlamps, the changes to the rear-end in 1987 {{had little to do with}} engineering, but rather, feedback from Cadillac's customer base who felt the 1985-86 car looked too short. Although the 1987 revamp was still quite similar to the 1986 model (so much in fact that it still used the previous year's deck lid), the design was more in-tune with the look that traditional Cadillac buyers were used to.|$|R
50|$|Exner's design {{included}} a spare tire that protruded through the trunklid and freestanding headlamps. The {{fuel filler cap}} is positioned inside the spare tire on the first models. The interior includes 24-carat gold plated trim and bird's eye maple or burled walnut and redwood, Connolly leather seats and dash, instrument markings in both English and Italian, fine wool or mink carpeting and headlining, a cigar lighter, and a liquor cabinet in the back. There is a clock in the steering wheel hub on some later models. Other special features include automatic headlamp controls with twilight sensor, <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps,</b> bilevel automatic airconditioning, Superlift air adjustable shockabsorbers, Safe-T-Track limited slip differential, an electric sunroof, cruise control, central locking, a burglar alarm, non-functional exhaust side pipes, and a high-end Lear Jet AM/FM eight-track quadraphonic sound system. The first models rolled on special 17-inch Firestone LXX run-flat tires and rims. These were taken off the market however as {{they turned out to}} be unsafe.|$|R
50|$|Water Police Offices and Wharves The Water Police office {{building}} is a two-storeyed reinforced concrete structure with a hipped tiled roof and deep eaves. The building faces the Brisbane River to the south, with a rear street entrance from the north. The building has large sash windows with expressed sills and window surrounds, and long tiled sunhoods to the ground floor windows along the east, north and west elevations. The southern elevation has a cantilevered verandah to the first floor, with tiled awning, timber posts, batten balustrade and handrail, and <b>corner</b> <b>lamps</b> supported by curved metal brackets. French doors with fanlights open from the ground floor to the south, and onto the verandah from the first floor.

25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps</b> had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps.

Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|R
40|$|SAE Recommended Practice J 852 and ECE Regulations 119 and 48 for <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps</b> were compared. Photometric points {{described}} in each specification were then compared to naturalistic low-speed turn trajectories produced by 87 drivers.

The angular offset and distance separating current and future positions were compiled to produce a map of useful preview positions—that is, positions relative to the current position of the vehicle that are far enough away to allow a driver to successfully stop if an object is first seen there. The distribution of preview positions shows strong concentrations between 30 and 35 degrees to the right or left of the current direction of travel. Geometric characteristics of this distribution were then compared to the geometry implied by the photometric minimum points indicated in the two specifications.
