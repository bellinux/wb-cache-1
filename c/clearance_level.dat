The [...] "principle of weak tranquility" [...] states that security levels may never change {{in such a way}} as to violate a defined security policy. Weak tranquility is desirable as it allows systems to observe the principle of least privilege.

50|$|The {{security}} {{profile of a}} user session includes the user identity, <b>clearance</b> <b>level</b> (0-63), compartment set, and set of allowed privileges. OS 2200 implements both Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and Discretionary Access Control (DAC) based on the Bell-La Padula model for confidentiality (no read up, no write down) and the Biba integrity model (no read down, no write up). For a run to read or execute a file, the run’s executing <b>clearance</b> <b>level</b> must be {{greater than or equal}} to the <b>clearance</b> <b>level</b> of the file, and the file’s <b>clearance</b> <b>level</b> must be 0 or within the <b>clearance</b> <b>level</b> range of the run; in addition, the run's executing compartment set must contain the file's compartment set.

40|$|The {{situation}} {{on the development of}} <b>clearance</b> <b>levels</b> for different types of materials in the Russian Federation is briefly discussed in the paper. The main approaches to the <b>clearance</b> <b>levels</b> definition as well as the calculation methods and measurement techniqques and procedures being used are described. It is shown that to achieve harmonization with the international community, additional research on determination of <b>clearance</b> <b>levels</b> and the development of the safety regulation requirements to the clearance procedures and checking of their adequate fulfillment should be carried out. INTRODUCTION The problems associated with the safety regulation of very low level waste management are of great importance for Russia.

This information is available when needed by government employees, such as the USA's Department of Defense (DoD) employees, but the designation signifies that the information should not be redistributed to users not designated to use it on an operational basis. For example, the organization and processes of an information-technology system may be designated Controlled Unclassified to users for whom the operational details of the system are non-critical.|$|E

40|$|The exact {{concepts}} of exclusion, exemption, and clearance {{have been addressed}} along with older terms such as de minimis and below regulatory concern (BRC). A series of decision-making procedure for determining the appropriateness of domestic implementation of the concepts were proposed: five primary categories (environmental and radiological factors, domestic social and political factors, economic factors, regulatory factors, technical factors) and four-step approach for establishing regulatory framework were described. Justification of implementing the concepts is to be determined at {{the first stage of}} political decision-making. A variety of dose limits and dose constraints, along with exemption/clearance criteria, were summarized in table forms. In addition, each country’s exemption/clearance levels for specific radionuclides were compared and displayed. Currently, there exist internationally endorsed exemption levels, however, it seems that the situation is more complicated in the case of <b>clearance</b> <b>levels.</b> Historical review of Korean practices in implementing the concepts was addressed, and current relevant regulations and regulatory system were introduced. In addition, the results of a preliminary dose assessment study for selected nineteen scenarios were given and discussed. They showed that the clearance of moderate amount of very low level of radioactive waste (VLLW) containing radionuclides whose concentrations are below the general <b>clearance</b> <b>levels</b> would not exceed predetermined exemption/clearance criteria (i. e. 10 µSv/y and 1 person⋅Sv/y), even under very conservative assumptions. It is believed that the basic methodology for deriving domestic <b>clearance</b> <b>levels</b> has been attained in the previous dose assessment study. Finally eleven regulatory issues have been suggested and discussed. It is desirable that the proposed issues are to be resolved before full implementation of the concepts in a country...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Database {{security}} mainly {{deal with}} the secrecy, integrity and availability of data stored in a database. The common threats to the databases involve Privilege Abuse, Weak Authentication, Weak Audit Trails and Operating System Vulnerabilities. To make the security least compromised; all users are required to follow the rules set up by Database Administrator. These rules {{are said to be}} Mandatory Access Control (MAC) based security policies. The Multi-Level secure Databases are implemented by considering these policies. A multilevel secure database provides internal security to the database. The data stored in MLS databases is classified in several levels of sensitivity. A user is allowed to access the data that matches its classification level. The user classification is referred to <b>clearance</b> <b>levels.</b> Therefore, users with different <b>clearance</b> <b>levels</b> access different versions of data. Due to the various issues like Covert channel, Polyinstantiation and lack of security while transmitting the data in distributed databases, it becomes difficult to design and develop the secure databases. Various challenges in front of researchers are Query processing in distributed Multilevel Secure Databases, Deadlock Detection and Resolution and Concurrency control. In this paper we present all these issues and also the techniques which resolve the issues...|$|R

50|$|Role-based {{access control}} (RBAC) is an access policy {{determined}} by the system, not by the owner. RBAC is used in commercial applications and also in military systems, where multi-level security requirements may also exist. RBAC differs from DAC in that DAC allows users to control access to their resources, while in RBAC, access is controlled at the system level, outside of the user's control. Although RBAC is non-discretionary, it can be distinguished from MAC primarily in the way permissions are handled. MAC controls read and write permissions based on a user's <b>clearance</b> <b>level</b> and additional labels. RBAC controls collections of permissions that may include complex operations such as an e-commerce transaction, or may {{be as simple as}} read or write.

40|$|Waste {{management}} strategy based on recycling and clearance already applied to SEAFP- 2 Plant Models is {{implemented in the}} following way: - For each activated component (or part of a component), the most appropriate {{management strategy}} is recommended, indicating the adequate cooling time, taken {{to be less than}} 100 years, required for the compliance with the limits. In some cases, two management options are suggested for the same material either allowing recycling or clearance, depending on different cooling times. - Clearance includes two possible paths: disposal as non-active waste, NAW, as for SEAFP- 2, and recycling outside the nuclear industry or non-active recyclable material, NARM. For the former option, SEAFP- 2 <b>clearance</b> <b>levels</b> are adopted, which are given in an IAEA interim document. For the latter option, different <b>clearance</b> <b>levels</b> defined in recent E. C. Recommendations are adopted. - An additional analysis concerns the possibility to attain conditions for clearance as non-active waste for the in-vessel V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti structures of PM- 1. In this alloy most of the long-term activity arises from the impurities. It is shown that such conditions could be reached by: a) reduction of the impurities concentration in the alloy to extremely low levels, also below the actual detection limit, and b) reprocessing of the irradiated material to eliminate noxious nuclides deriving from the components of the alloy.
