5|$|As {{cars have}} become safer for {{occupants}} (due to airbags, structural <b>crashworthiness</b> and other improvements) {{the percent of}} pedestrian fatalities {{as a percent of}} total motor vehicle fatalities steadily increased from 11% in 2004 to 15% in 2014 according to NHTSA data. Bicyclists accounted for 2 percent of all traffic deaths in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Positive {{train control}} became a Federal mandate {{with the passing}} of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. After review, the FRA waiver was granted in May 2010, marking the first time lighter-weight EMUs were allowed to share rails with freight in the United States. The grant was {{conditioned}} on meeting nine additional requirements, including demonstrating minimum <b>crashworthiness,</b> seating, improving grade crossing, meeting FRA positive train control standards in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 236 with CBOSS, formalizing the temporal separation plan, and issuing a safety system program.|$|E

25|$|The {{use of a}} {{lightweight}} modified bus body, and other bus components and fittings, such as bus-style seating. The Pacers use a modified bus body with a reinforced cab area, in order to comply with <b>crashworthiness</b> standards.|$|E
25|$|The first AC {{member of}} the TRAXX2 family, which {{featured}} carbodies with improved <b>crashworthiness</b> and water-cooled IGBT-based inverters, was the demonstrator loco 185 561, delivered in May 2004. It was produced ahead of the main tranche of TRAXX F140AC2 locomotives for homologation of the class in Germany.|$|E
25|$|The SportStar is an {{all-metal}} design {{made from}} anodized, corrosion-proofed aluminum. The airframe uses a pop-riveted and bonded construction, {{which the company}} claims will improve fatigue characteristics and result in a longer service life. The company also claims this construction technique results in better <b>crashworthiness,</b> the elimination of rivet zippering in an accident and quieter in-flight noise levels due to the elimination of oil-canning and flexing.|$|E
25|$|The AAIB {{also studied}} the <b>crashworthiness</b> of the {{aircraft}} during the accident sequence. It observed that the main attachment point for the main landing gear (MLG) was the rear spar {{of the aircraft}}'s wing; because this spar also formed the rear wall of the main fuel tanks, the crash landing caused the tanks to rupture. It was recommended that Boeing redesign the landing gear attachment to {{reduce the likelihood of}} fuel loss in similar circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The new {{locomotives}} {{are similar}} in appearance to a Class 58; a hood unit design with a narrow body typical of locomotive types in use in North America, the cabs are accessed from the rear via exterior walkways on the narrow part of the hood. The distinctive front end shape is due to <b>crashworthiness</b> features It is also fitted with air conditioning and acoustic insulation to improve the crew's environment, making it an improvement over the Class 66.|$|E
25|$|In September 2012, Sikorsky {{was awarded}} a Combat Tempered Platform Demonstration (CTPD) {{contract}} to further improve the Black Hawk's durability and survivability. The company is to develop new technologies such as a zero-vibration system, adaptive flight control laws, advanced fire management, a more durable main rotor, full-spectrum <b>crashworthiness,</b> and damage tolerant airframe; then they are to transition them to the helicopter. Improvements to the Black Hawk are to continue until the Future Vertical Lift program is ready to replace it.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 2011, Norfolk Southern began {{rebuilding}} its EX-Norfolk and Western and EX-Southern SD40-2 {{units with}} new cabs. Norfolk Southern calls them Admiral Cabs because the design {{came from a}} former Admiral on the Norfolk Southern board of directors. Norfolk Southern has rebuild 143 SD40-2 units with new Admiral Cabs. The reason behind using a custom cab is because buying EMD cabs would require NS {{to pay for the}} construction and a due to EMD. Admiral Cabs have benefits such as; new heating/A.C., improved <b>crashworthiness,</b> new controls, and modified windows for reducing sun glare.|$|E
25|$|Supertram is {{scheduled}} to begin operations of the new tram-train line from Cathedral to Rotherham Parkgate, using seven brand new Vossloh-built Class 399 Citylink articulated electric multiple units. The existing Siemens-Duewag Supertram fleet will not be upgraded for tram-train operation, so have not been registered under TOPS and cannot be used on the line as they lack the relevant Network Rail safety systems and <b>crashworthiness.</b> The tram-train scheme, which was first planned to be in service by 2015 has been delayed and is not expected to start until the summer 2018.|$|E
25|$|Initially the A-train family {{consisted}} of multiple units {{designed and built}} by Hitachi, initially for use on the railway system in Japan. The A-train family comprises trains for both commuter services and limited express services. Hitachi has given the family a modular design which enables both production and refurbishment to be undertaken faster. The A-train's strong body {{is the result of}} the use of revolutionary technology called friction stir welding (FSW). Due to the low heat input of this patented process high strength, excellent <b>crashworthiness</b> and minimal distortion can be achieved.|$|E
25|$|Caltrain {{plans to}} use lighter {{electric}} multiple units that do not comply with the US Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) <b>crashworthiness</b> standards, but instead comply with the International Union of Railways (UIC) standards, on the electrified lines. FRA granted Caltrain a waiver to operate these units, which were previously banned on mix-used lines with other FRA-compliant rolling stock due to concerns over crash worthiness, after Caltrain submitted simulation data showing UIC-compliant rolling stock performed no worse or even better than FRA-compliant rolling stock in crashes. Caltrain plans to retain their newer diesel-electric rolling stock for use on the Dumbarton Extension and service south of Tamien.|$|E
25|$|The Diamond DA42 Twin Star is twin-engined low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane, {{commonly used}} as a general aviation aircraft for touring and training purposes. It {{is equipped with a}} retractable tricycle landing gear arrangement and uses a T-tail. The DA42 incorporates a combination of advanced features within the company's first twin-engine design. The airframe is composed from composite materials, making extensive use of carbon fiber reinforced polymers throughout its structure; this construction provides the aircraft with a suitable passive safety level to conform with the established European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Part 21 rules, as well as relatively efficient aerodynamics and essentially unlimited airframe life. The carbon-fiber main wing spars possesses exceptional <b>crashworthiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early on, the TBM 700 was {{available}} in several different configurations and models. The introduction of the TBM 700C2, which increased the maximum takeoff weight from 6,578lb to 7,394lb, enabled operators to fly with both fully laden fuel tanks and maximum cabin occupancy instead of comprising between the two due to weight restrictions. The modifications made upon this model included {{the addition of a}} baggage compartment aft of the rear pressure bulkhead, the strengthening of the wing and landing gear, and seat <b>crashworthiness</b> certification for up to 20 G to accommodate for an elevated stall speed at higher weights. Around the same time, SOCATA decided to re-design the interior of the aircraft, both in terms of the fittings and finish, along with the adoption of a new integrated environmental control system, to improve passenger comfort levels.|$|E
25|$|The NH90 {{featured}} {{an advanced}} composite airframe, designed for ballistic tolerance, {{a high level}} of <b>crashworthiness,</b> lower weight, and 30 per cent greater endurance than a metallic counterpart. The four main rotor blades are also composed of composite materials, increasing fatigue strength and lifespan while providing for greater damage tolerance. The unobstructed main cabin area is entered either by large sliding doors {{on either side of the}} fuselage or via a rear ramp, the cabin is designed to accommodate modular equipment packages to enable the rotorcraft to be rapidly reconfigured, providing for operational flexibility. In a troop-transport capacity, the cabin can accommodate up to 20 fully equipped soldiers, or up to 12 stretchers in a medical evacuation role, some light vehicles may also be transported; the main cabin is equipped with environmental control systems and sound proofing measures to improve passenger conditions.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{the basic}} TRAXX design was {{subjected}} to a major overhaul, with the carbody and the front redesigned to suit current <b>crashworthiness</b> standards, and the replacement of GTO thyristor based inverters with IGBT based inverters. The option of individual axle control in place of individual bogie control was also introduced. The coolant of the inverters and the main transformer was also changed from ester to water. The carbody design was completely standardised, by default providing a space for the mounting of a flip-disc display above the windshield, which is covered by a non-structural hood in freight versions. The bogie frame was strengthened, to allow an increase of axle loads to 22 tons. This generation of the family is {{also referred to as}} the TRAXX2 platform, and is sometimes also indicated with a number 2 {{at the end of the}} type designations.|$|E
25|$|The DA42 {{typically}} accommodates four people, {{these being}} {{a pair of}} pilots sat in side-by-side seating along with two passengers seated behind each of the pilots. All of the seats have been designed for <b>crashworthiness</b> and are complete with automotive-style three-point seat belts; while the seats themselves are fixed in position, {{the position of the}} rudder-pedals is adjustable. The front pair of seats are accessed via a front-hinged canopy while a top-hinged door located on the left side provides access to the rear seats. The interior of the cabin is relatively spacious, an additional third row of seating can be installed so that a maximum of seven people can be accommodated; the seats can also be folded to allow for the carriage of bulky items. The pilots are housed under a sizable canopy which provides generous external visibility, save for the use of a large fixed sunscreen. Additionally, separate baggage compartments, which are accessible via external hatches, are contained within internal space in the aircraft's nose.|$|E
25|$|In a {{passenger}} configuration, the pressurised cabin of the TBM is typically fitted with highly finished interiors, often featuring luxury {{materials such as}} high quality leathers and wood veneers. The seats are certified for their <b>crashworthiness</b> for up to 20 G. From the TBM 850 onwards, a combined air conditioner/environmental control system was integrated into the cabin, being simpler and requiring less adjustment than the prior arrangement. At cruise altitudes, the cabin of the TBM 900 is noticeably quieter that its predecessors; the reduction {{is due to the}} adoption of a new five-bladed propeller and the reduction of vibration levels via greater isolation between the engine and the airframe. Later built models are equipped with winglets, which were developed by SOCATA primarily to reduce drag when flown at high angles of attack, such as during takeoffs, as well as to enhance the aircraft's aesthetics. The TBM 900 saw the adoption of a new five-bladed propeller, specially optimised by Hartzell based upon airflow simulations conducted of the TBM's forward section. According to SOCATA, Hartzell's selection over a similar advanced counterpart from MT-Propeller was made due to the former raising the cruise speed by around 3 to 5 kts.|$|E
25|$|In addition, NIOSH {{researchers}} are pursuing {{a line of}} research related to ambulance safety. In the U.S., an ambulance {{may be one of}} a number of vehicle body types, and there are no comprehensive safety standards that specify requirements for safety and <b>crashworthiness.</b> Of special concern is the safety of workers in the ambulance patient compartment, where work tasks are not compatible with the use of occupant restraints and where equipment and interior layout put workers at high risk of injury in the event of a crash. Sled and crash tests of ambulances conducted by NIOSH and partners show that retrofitting patient compartments with redesigned occupant restraints will allow EMS workers the level of mobility needed to care for patients and at the same time afford greater protection from injury than standard lap belts. NIOSH work in this area has led to development of new voluntary standards for crash-testing of ambulances. The research program has now expanded to address the full range of human-factors concerns about worker safety in ambulance patient compartment, with a number of other manufacturing standards and testing standards in progress.|$|E
25|$|In {{recognition}} of his effects on roadside and motorsports safety, Sicking was elected a Charter Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors, and President George W. Bush awarded him the 2005 National Medal of Technology and Innovation (NMTI). The NMTI is the highest honor that the United States can bestow on a citizen whose technologies have made a positive contribution {{to the welfare of}} the nation. Sicking’s efforts have also won him the first-awarded Pioneering and Innovation Award in the history of Autosport Magazine, in 2004, for his work on the SAFER Barrier. He has also received the 2011 Ken Stonex Award, presented by the Transportation Research Board Committee on Roadside Safety Design, in {{recognition of}} a lifetime of achievement in <b>crashworthiness</b> design. The Texas Motorsports Hall of Fame awarded Sicking the 2005 Vision Award for his contributions to racing safety, and countless individual raceways have honored him with their awards, including NASCAR’s 2003 Bill France Junior Award for Excellence, Pocono Raceway’s 2004 Bill France Award of Excellence, Indianapolis Motor Speedway’s Herb Porter Award in 2004, and the 2002 Motorsports Engineering Award from the Society of Automotive Engineers and the Specialty Equipment Market Association, among numerous others.|$|E
500|$|The crew {{compartment}} has shielding between the cockpits, such {{that at least}} one crew member can survive hits. The compartment and the rotor blades are designed to sustain a hit from [...] rounds. The airframe includes some [...] of protection and has a self-sealing fuel system to protect against ballistic projectiles. The aircraft was designed to meet the <b>crashworthiness</b> requirements of MIL-STD-1290, which specifies minimum requirement for crash impact energy attenuation to minimize crew injuries and fatalities. This was achieved through incorporation of increased structural strength, crashworthy landing gear, seats and fuel system.|$|E
500|$|Following the accident, the {{engineer}} and {{conductor of the}} Capitol Limited filed lawsuits against Amtrak, CSX {{and the state of}} Maryland for $103 million (1996 USD) alleging negligence, singling out the removal of the signal between Kensington and Georgetown Junction and the operator error by the MARC engineer. Both men claimed that the injuries they sustained in the crash [...] "prevent them from returning to work." [...] In 1999, responding to the crash, the Federal Railroad Administration issued comprehensive rules for passenger car design, [...] "the first ...in the 169-year history of rail passenger service." [...] The new rules required that new control cars and multiple units be built to higher <b>crashworthiness</b> standards.|$|E
500|$|The 1000-Series entered {{service in}} 1976 when the Metro system opened, and were {{refurbished}} and had their motors converted from DC to AC propulsion by Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie in the mid-1990s. In 2006, the NTSB cited the 1000-Series cars as [...] "vulnerable to catastrophic telescoping damage and complete loss of occupant survival {{space in a}} longitudinal end-structure collision". It recommended refurbishment of the entire series after a 2004 collision at the Woodley Park station in which a 1000-Series Rohr car telescoped into another train. In this case, NTSB's Hersman confirmed that, [...] "the first car [...] overrode the rear car , {{and much of the}} survivable space on that first car of the striking train was compromised". The NTSB called for the accelerated retirement of the 1000-Series cars, or urged that they be [...] "retrofitted with <b>crashworthiness</b> collision protection that is comparable to 6000-Series car railcars." [...] Additionally, the 1000-Series cars lack data recorders {{that could be used in}} determining the cause of a crash. During the press conference, Catoe stated that he had [...] "no basis to suspend the use of 1000-Series cars at this time". However, WMATA later announced a decision to no longer use the 1000-Series cars as the lead or trailing units of any trains.|$|E
2500|$|One notable {{achievement}} {{included the}} Center for Auto Safety ranking the 1993 Concorde as superior in <b>crashworthiness</b> after testing it at [...] into a wall.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{sponsored}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to improve front and side <b>crashworthiness</b> was first applied into production compact vehicles starting with the 1973 Hornet, which included stronger doors designed to withstand [...] penetration in the first [...] of crush.|$|E
2500|$|Key {{features}} of the design are the high power-to-weight ratio of the locomotives (1678kW per ~70-tonne loco), which were purpose-built for high-speed passenger travel, improved <b>crashworthiness</b> over previous models, and bi-directional running avoiding {{the need for a}} locomotive to run around at terminating stations. Until the HST's introduction, the maximum speed of British trains was limited to [...] The HST allowed a 25% increase in service speeds along many of the lines they operated.|$|E
2500|$|The 2CV was {{produced}} for 42 years, the model finally succumbing to customer demands for speed, {{in which this}} ancient design had fallen significantly behind modern cars, and safety. Although {{the front of the}} chassis was designed to fold up, to form a crumple zone according to a 1984 Citroën brochure, in common with other small cars of its era its <b>crashworthiness</b> was very poor by modern standards. (The drive for improved safety in Europe happened from the 1990s onwards, and accelerated with the 1997 advent of Euro NCAP.) Its advanced underlying engineering was ignored or misunderstood by the public, being clothed in an anachronistic body. It was the butt of many a joke, especially by Jasper Carrott in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|The {{focus of}} {{preventive}} measures {{to date has}} been on the design of car seats, primarily through the introduction of head restraints, often called headrests. This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries — an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of head restraints appears to have been low, approximately 5–10%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase <b>crashworthiness</b> [...] of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low-speed rear impact collisions. Improvements in the geometry of car seats through better design and energy absorption could offer additional benefits. Active devices move the body in a crash in order to shift the loads on the car seat.|$|E
2500|$|The Gen I EV1 models, {{released}} in 1996, used lead-acid batteries, which weighed [...] The first batch of batteries {{were provided by}} GM's Delco Remy Division; these were rated at 53amp-hours at 312volts (16.5 kWh), and initially provided a range of [...] per charge. The battery pack design, including the battery tray, electronic monitoring, safety disconnects, and <b>crashworthiness,</b> was utilized on all EV1 models and accommodated future (planned) energy storage products including NiMH and Lithium-ion. Gen II cars, {{released in}} 1999, used a new batch of lead-acid batteries provided by Panasonic, which now weighed some Gen I cars were retrofitted with this battery pack.

Waters under the Delco Remy organization). The NiMH batteries, rated at 77amp-hours at 343volts (26.4 kWh), gave the cars a range of [...] per charge, more than twice what the original Gen I cars could drive with.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012, the UH-72A was {{submitted}} in the US Air Force's Common Vertical Life Support Platform (CVLSP) {{program for a}} UH-1N Twin Huey replacement. As with the US Army, the UH-72A can operate in permissive environments, such as ICBM site support and security under the Air Force Global Strike Command and personnel transport in the National Capital Region by the Air Mobility Command's 89th Airlift Wing. Advantages over the UH-1N include 30 percent more speed, range, and loiter time, enhanced reliability and <b>crashworthiness,</b> night vision compatibility, modern avionics, and being cheaper to operate. In August 2013, the USAF said it planned to sustain the UH-1N for six to ten more years. In September 2013, acting Air Force Secretary Eric Fanning {{received a letter from}} the CEO of EADS North America, arguing that to refit and maintain the Hueys costs more than to acquire and operate UH-72As; the letter also urged prompt action as Army orders were almost complete and production was winding down. The USAF said it had insufficient funding for such a procurement and can risk using Hueys for a while. EADS North America stated that the UH-72A [...] "will lower the risk to the U.S. Air Force nuclear enterprise, and will save taxpayers the considerable cost of future recapitalization." [...] Reportedly, buying UH-72As would cost as much as upgrading 62 Hueys, but long-term operating costs would be much lower.|$|E
2500|$|The SD70ACu is a {{diesel-electric}} locomotive first built by EMD and later rebuilt by Norfolk Southern. It is originally an SD90MAC (or well-known as SD9043MAC) {{that has been}} rebuilt to renew its electrical components and replace the cab with the new EMD Phase-II cab {{to comply with the}} most recent safety requirements. These locomotives are similar to the SD70ACe model, but have a different prime mover, which is EMD's 4,300hp (3,210kW) 16-cylinder 710G engine, the same engine used on the SD70MAC. The SD70ACu has three radiator fans, retaining the original configuration of that of SD9043MAC instead of two radiator fans as SD70ACe has. The shape of the rear end of SD70ACu looks like a [...] "Big T", which was the rear end shape of the SD9043MAC, while the rear end shape of SD70ACe is like an [...] "arrow head" [...] (from above). They also have the latest EMD cab that meets current FRA <b>crashworthiness</b> standards. These locomotives also have the Ultra Cab II, locomotive speed limiter (LSL), and cab signals. 100 of the 110 units Norfolk Southern purchased were originally SD9043MACs previously operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. The other 10 units were acquired by a trade with Cit Group for MP15DC's. All NS-owned SD9043MACs are slowly being rebuilt by NS at its shops in Altoona, Pennsylvania. As of September 20, 2017, 84 SD70ACU units have been completed and released to active service.|$|E

50|$|Automotive <b>crashworthiness</b> design.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crashworthiness</b> is {{the ability}} of a {{structure}} to protect its occupants during an impact. This is commonly tested when investigating the safety of aircraft and vehicles. Depending {{on the nature of the}} impact and the vehicle involved, different criteria are used to determine the <b>crashworthiness</b> of the structure. <b>Crashworthiness</b> may be assessed either prospectively, using computer models (e.g., LS-DYNA, PAM-CRASH, MSC Dytran, MADYMO) or experiments, or retrospectively by analyzing crash outcomes. Several criteria are used to assess <b>crashworthiness</b> prospectively, including the deformation patterns of the vehicle structure, the acceleration experienced by the vehicle during an impact, and the probability of injury predicted by human body models. Injury probability is defined using criteria, which are mechanical parameters (e.g., force, acceleration, or deformation) that correlate with injury risk. A common injury criterion is the Head impact criterion (HIC). <b>Crashworthiness</b> is assessed retrospectively by analyzing injury risk in real-world crashes, often using regression or other statistical techniques to control for the myriad of confounders that are present in crashes.|$|E
