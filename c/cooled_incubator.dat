40|$|PhDThe {{relationships}} and subfamilial classification of the Chironomidae (Insecta: iptera, ematocera) are discussed and some comments {{made on the}} ecological significance {{of the range of}} larval habitats found in the family. The reasons are given for the selection of the aquatic larval Orthocladiinae for detailed morphological and ecological study. Following a review of previous taxonomic works and an analysis of the current views on the Orthocladiinae, a method for rearing aquatic larval Chironomidae is described. This method utilises disposable petri-dishes each containing a single larva, kept in a <b>cooled</b> <b>incubator.</b> This is followed by a list of fifty-two collecting sites throughout Britain with some physical and biological data for each site. Keys for the identification of the larvae of all known Holarotic genera are presented based on reared British material and incorporating published descriptions and examination of overseas specimens. Generic diagnoses to forty-one British genera of Orthocladiinae and descriptions and keys to ninety-one aquatic species are given. These have been prepared from examination of about 1, 230 specimens, reared, collected and sent by correspondents. For each genus the {{relationships and}} phylogeny are discussed and for each species a full description is given using morphological terminology outlined in a previous chapter. Over four hundred illustrations in seventy-nine plates show the features of each species, many for the first time. Under each species all available ecological and distributional information is given. Eleven species either cannot be associated with adults or else appear to belong to undescribed species. In a concluding chapter the relationship between the phylogeny and ecology of the subfamily is discussed incorporating additionally information about genera with terrestrial and marine larvae. The importance of species identification especially for indicator organisms in pollution biology, as well as for calculations of diversity in freshwater habitats, is stressed...|$|E
40|$|Copepods were sampled at two {{sampling}} sites off {{the island}} of São Vicente, Cape Verde Archipelago, in spring (March/April) and early summer (May/June) of 2010. The two sampling sites were located in Mindelo Bay (16. 90 N, 25. 01 W; bottom depth 22 m) and around 8 km off the town of São Pedro (16. 77 N, 25. 12 W; bottom depth 800 m). Samples were collected on board the local fishing vessel 'Sinagoga' using a WP- 2 net (Hydrobios, 0. 26 m** 2 mouth opening, 200 µm mesh size). The net was either applied as a driftnet, drifting for 10 min in 22 to 0 m depth below the surface, or it was towed vertically with a towing speed of 0. 5 m/s** 1. For stratified sampling, the net was deployed in repetitive hauls from 560 to 210 m, from 210 to 80 m, and from 80 to 0 m in March/April and from 600 to 300 m, 300 to 100 m, and 100 to 0 m in May/June. Additional depth-integrated hauls were conducted from 600 - 0 m or 500 - 0 m during both field campaigns. Respiration rates of epi- and mesopelagic calanoid copepods were measured in the land-based laboratory at the Instituto Nacional de Desenvolvimento das Pescas (INDP) in Mindelo. Oxygen consumption was measured non-invasively by optode respirometry at three different ambient temperatures (13, 18, and 23 °C) with a 10 -channel oxygen respirometer (Oxy- 10 Mini, PreSens Precision Sensing GmbH, Regensburg, Germany). All experiments were run in darkness in temperature-controlled incubators (LMS <b>Cooled</b> <b>Incubator</b> Series 1 A, Model 280) equipped with water baths to ensure constant temperatures throughout the experiments, tolerating a variation of ± 1 °C...|$|E

At launch, Frederator produced three animated {{series for the}} channel: Bravest Warriors, created by Pendleton Ward; SuperCrappers,createdd by James Kochalka; and Too <b>Cool!</b> Cartoons, an <b>incubator</b> featuring content from different animators. Bravest Warriors premiered on November 8, 2012 and SuperCrappers premiered on November 30, 2012.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{examined}} the effect of rapid cooling with air and CO 2 on shell egg quality over 14 wk. The 240 fresh eggs were initially heated to 47 C for 24 h in an <b>incubator,</b> <b>cooled</b> using rapid air cooling or CO 2 cooling, and then stored in air or CO 2 in 250 -mL jars for 14 wk. The CO 2 levels were recorded of the jar atmo-sphere, of the egg air cell, and of the egg albumen. The Haugh units of each egg, pH, and of albumen from five eggs per group were also recorded. Haugh units are a logarithmic, empirical relationship between albumen height and egg weight (Stadelman, 1995). Haugh units for the control eggs averaged 70. 8 over 10 wk of the study. The control eggs were of such poor quality {{that they could not}} be sampled after 10 wk. The (Key words: rapid cooling, carbon dioxide, shell eggs, Haugh units...|$|R
40|$|Cryopreservation {{refers to}} the {{maintenance}} of algae cultures at sub-zero temperature for preservation and long term storage. It is a relatively inexpensive method and is beneficial for large scale culture collections and the aquaculture industry. Cryoprotection agents (CPAs) such as DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) and MeOH (methanol) are often used for treatment of microalgae to reduce cell damage and increase sample survival. This experiment tests the effectiveness of two CPAs (DMSO and MeOH) and two freezing methods (slow- and flash-freezing) on the viability of two phytoplankton microalgae species, Isochrysis and Pseudo-nitzschia. Slow-freezing was induced via step <b>cooling</b> in culture <b>incubators</b> and placement in a deep freezer (- 20 °C). Flash-freezing was conducted by submerging samples in liquid N 2. Both CPAs and freezing methods showed zero viability in post-freezing results. None of the Isochrysis and Pseudo-nitzschia cells were observed alive after the cryopreservation experiments. Chemical and physical stress could have been responsible for cell damage and fatality. Knowledge of microalgal cryopreservation is still very limited and has often been unsuccessful. Future studies are recommended. ABREVIATIONS CPA – cryoprotective agent; DMSO – dimethyl sulfoxide; MeOH – methanol; DHA – docosahexaenoic aci...|$|R
