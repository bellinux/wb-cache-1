50|$|The Town Council held a {{competition}} for a {{design for the}} eastern church, St Andrew's, which was won by Captain Andrew Frazer of the Royal Engineers and Robert Kay. The church was founded in 1781 and opened in 1784. The church is notable for its elliptical plan {{which was the first}} in Britain. The site {{on the north side of}} George Street was already developed when the Town Council bought it back to establish the Church, and this shallow space suited the elliptical design. There are similarities to William Adam's design for Hamilton Old Parish Church and to James Gibbs' original idea for St Martin-in-the-Fields in London, both of which were circular sanctuaries fronted with porticoes. The architectural style reflects the contemporary 18th-century fashion for classical Roman forms. These include the temple-front portico with <b>ceiling</b> <b>rosettes</b> based on examples found in Syria by Robert Wood and illustrated in his Ruins of Palmyra of 1753. The magnificent interior-ceiling design, in the style of Robert Adam, also incorporates many features found in Roman and Pompeian interior design, as well as Scottish thistles. The pulpit stands on the north wall, with a panelled gallery with original box pews round the other sides of the ellipse. The pulpit was lowered and the sounding board removed during a 1953 refurbishment, with sections of 19th century box pews removed during 2012 refurbishments.|$|R
50|$|The four-story {{courthouse}} has {{an entirely}} smooth limestone exterior with 40 freestanding ionic columns. Scales {{of justice and}} lanterns adorn the exterior. Inside the courthouse is a two story marble art deco atrium of marble and a courtroom with walnut wainscoting, a plaster <b>ceiling</b> featuring gilded <b>rosettes</b> and walls textured to resemble stone.|$|R
50|$|The {{outer walls}} are {{designed}} with miniature shikaras of both Dravidian and Nagara style. The pillars of the open main hall are lathe turned wood. They have a bell shaped section and other decorations including elephants and diamond shaped motifs in bands. The elephants are carved so {{there appears to be}} a space between their trunks and the pillars. The band motifs vary in detail. The temple main hall has a large domed ceiling. It consists of concentric circles of cusped mouldings. At the apex, the <b>ceiling</b> falls <b>rosette</b> or pendant design. The overlying roof is a stepped pyramid shape.|$|R
50|$|From 1967 on, {{works on}} the {{reconstruction}} of the church have been led by architect Wiktor Zin. According to Zin's draft, marble pilasters with Corinthian capitals were placed inside, a choir built and reflective mirrored mosaic installed. Wiktor Zin also designed mosaics on the <b>ceilings,</b> sanctuary decor, <b>rosettes</b> in the coffers of the dome and stained glass windows.|$|R
5000|$|Room 5 (known as the Room of Eden) was the {{residence}} of the Vicar General of Ascoli and its name comes from the columns of travertine that represent Adam and Eve. Also found here are the Arm-reliquary of Saint Emygdius made by Pietro Vannini in the 15th century, several Baroque paintings, and a 15th-century coffered <b>ceiling</b> decorated with <b>rosettes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main courtrooms are {{the most}} {{significant}} spaces on the third floor. The most impressive is the two-story en banc courtroom that is designed {{for all of the}} appellate judges to meet to hear a case. Walls are covered with elaborately carved, stained oak paneling decorated with garlands, scrolled brackets, and molding. Large, round-arch windows are balanced with recessed arched bays on the opposite walls. Bronze grilles are located throughout. The maple floor is laid in a herringbone pattern and an elaborate, plaster, coffered <b>ceiling</b> with <b>rosettes</b> tops the room. Another appellate courtroom, although slightly smaller in scale, is equally impressive. Similar finishes are used on the walls and floor, and a gallery of oak benches provides seating for observers.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Loggia", already called {{so since}} 1493, was {{finished}} in the 16th century. The Tower Terrace sports a great {{view of the city}} through the round arcs. On the east side there is a stair tower. The wooden <b>ceiling</b> with shaped <b>rosettes</b> is descended from the time of Wilhelm V. There is a stone walled music platform {{on the south side of}} the room. The [...] "Söller" [...] is today used for many different functions, and it holds a maximum of 99 people.|$|R
50|$|The massive west {{front is}} divided into five parts by six lesene (applied strips), {{each of which is}} surmounted by a {{tabernacle}} housing a statue. The façade has several mullioned windows with, in the centre, a large rose window framed by a motif inspired by Roman antique <b>ceilings,</b> decorated with <b>rosettes,</b> masks and star motifs.The façade is considered Romanesque in its structure and Gothic in its decoration. Typical of the latter is the porch, with 14th century gargoyles on the sides and the 13th century lunette with the 16th century busts of Theodelinda and King Agilulf. Over the porch is the statue of Saint John the Baptist (15th century). Over the portal is depicted the Baptism of Jesus, assisted by Saint Peter, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint Zachary and Saint Paul. In the upper section is portrayed Theodelinda offering to John the Baptist the Iron Crown of Lombardy, together with her kneeling husband Agilulf and their children Adaloald and Gundeberga.|$|R
2500|$|The nave has {{a curved}} plaster <b>ceiling</b> with plaster <b>rosettes.</b> [...] The round chancel arch is medieval. The chancel has an arch-braced wooden roof. The pews are dated 1697, the altar rails {{are from the}} late 18thcentury and the two {{sanctuary}} chairs are also early. The font is unusual in that it has seven sides. [...] The communion rail is from the 18thcentury. [...] The oak pulpit is plain and is dated 1687 with brass nails. [...] On the west wall of the nave are the royal arms of GeorgeIII dated 1760 and a hatchment to the Purleston family. [...] A pane of glass, formerly from the east window is preserved in a frame {{to the left of}} the organ. [...] On it is scratched [...] "I, Robert Aldersey, was here on 1stday of October 1756 along with John Massie and MrDerbyshire. The roads were so bad that we were in danger of our lives". [...] The parish registers date from 1538 and the churchwardens' accounts from 1725.|$|R
50|$|The Union County Courthouse {{was built}} from 1927 - 28 as a Greek revival by Mann & Stern architects of Little Rock. The {{original}} Union County Courthouse, built in 1844 {{at a cost}} of $200 stood where Larry's Rexall Drug Store is today. As the county seat, El Dorado quickly outgrew even its second courthouse (built on this site in 1848) in the 1920s due to the oil boom's voluminous deed and title transactions. Faceted in smooth-dressed limestone, the third and current courthouse boasts 40 freestanding ionic exterior columns spanning four stories, and a richly detailed marble two-story atrium with art deco accents. The exterior medallions of the scales of justice and lanterns of light signify the search for truth. The building's largest courtroom features a walnut wainscot, painting and scoring on textured plaster walls to resemble stone, and an ornately detailed plaster cast <b>ceiling</b> of gilded <b>rosettes.</b> Back when the square was flanked by log cabin structures there was a large duck pond on this site. Emigrants camped on its banks. Many pioneer citizens recorded incidents where deer and even bears came to drink - and hunters would frequently bag their dinner by shooting the wild ducks that lit there in the mid-1800. It was filled in under contract by Ben Mathews.|$|R
