Although many development projects have attempted to reduce the impacts of agriculture on the tropical rainforest, the situation is still a cause for concern. A study of the farming system of the San Jose Maya community was therefore carried out to examine agricultural production in its social, cultural, economic, and political context. Results demon-strate that agricultural production contributes to forest degradation because of the limited avail-ability of agricultural land, the low level of investment in agricultural production, the land tenure system, limited marketing opportunities, and the exclusion of Mayas from the country’s polit-ical and economic domains. Agroforestry could, however, offer a partial {{solution to the problem of}} forest degradation. Three types of traditional agroforestry systems are practised in San Jose: the milpa (a slash-and-burn agriculture system), cacao (Theobroma cacao) <b>cultivation</b> <b>under</b> <b>shade</b> trees, and the homegarden. These traditional agroforestry systems almost entirely meet a family’s needs for food and wood, and generate at least 62 % of family income. Improving the productivity of these systems could help to reduce pressure on the forest in southern Belize...|$|E
40|$|Uma nova variedade de Coffea arabica L., provavelmente originária de Manhumirim, Estado de Minas Gerais, e cultivada em pequena escala no Estado do Espírito Santo, foi recebida, pelo Instituto Agronômico de Campinas, em 1937. Trata-se da variedade caturra. Carateriza-se por apresentar porte menor do que o da variedade bourbon, da qual provàvelmente se originou. Os internódios são bem curtos, tanto no caule como nos ramos, sendo intensa a ramificação secundária e de ordem inferior. As fôlhas são de um verde bem escuro, maiores e proporcionalmente mais largas do que as do Bourbon. As flores são pouco menores e os frutos e sementes um pouco maiores do que as dessa variedade. No presente trabalho apresentam-se os resultados das pesquisas taxonômicas relativas a essa nova variedade de C. arabica e alguns dados preliminares referentes à sua constituição cromosômica e genética. Verificou-se ser de 2 n = 44 o número de cromosômios somáticos e, dos cruzamentos com as variedades typica e bourbon, conclui-se que os seus principais caracteres são devidos à ação de um só par de fatôres genéticos dominantes principais (Ct Ct). As observações preliminares relativas à produtividade indicam que se trata de uma variedade de elevada capacidade produtiva, merecendo, por conseguinte, a atenção que se vem dando aos trabalhos ora em realização nas principais zonas cafeeiras. A forma xanthocarpa parece diferir do Caturra Vermelho apenas na coloração amarela dos frutos, que é devida ao mesmo fator (xc xc) que carateriza a forma xanthocarpa da variedade typica (2). A new {{variety of}} Coffea arabica L., which is {{believed}} to have originated in the region of Manhumirim, in the State of Minas Gerais and which is cultivated on a small scale in the State of Espirito Santo, was sent to the Instituto Agronômico in Campinas, in 1937. The new variety is called caturra and is characterized as being somewhat smaller than the bourbon variety from which it probably originated. The internodes, both on the main stem and branches, are very short and secondary branches are abundant. It has very dark green leaves that are larger and proportionally longer than those of the bourbon variety. Also in comparison with this variety, its flowers are a little smaller but its fruits and seeds are slightly larger. The results of a taxonomic study together with preliminary information on the genetic constitution of the caturra variety, are presented in this paper. It was found to have 2 n= 44 somatic chromosomes and from crosses made between this variety and the varieties typica and bourbon, it was determined that its principal morphological characters were due largely to the action of a single pair of dominant genetic factors (Ct Ct). Preliminary data indicate that the caturra variety has a high yielding capacity and that it may be particularly well adapted to <b>cultivation</b> <b>under</b> <b>shade.</b> There is a yellow fruited (xanthocarpa) form of caturra that {{is the same as the}} red fruited form except for the color difference. The yellow fruit color of caturra is probably determined by the same genetic factor (xc xc) that characterizes the xanthocarpa form of the variety typica...|$|E

The aim of the present work was to assess the effect of the rootstock and the scion on the antioxidant activity and the content in vitamin C, total phenols, lycopene and β-carotene of bell pepper. The cultivars Fascinato and Jeanette were used as scion and Terrano was used as rootstock. Four harvests in the production cycle of the vegetable were analyzed in a <b>cultivation</b> system <b>under</b> <b>shading</b> nets. The results indicate statistical differences in the content of these bioactive compounds between the varieties, between grafting and not grafting and between sampling dates (p ≤ 0. 05). The vitamin C content, β-carotene, and antioxidant capacity proved significantly higher in Fascinato than in Janette. On average, grafting increased β-carotene and vitamin C concentrations and improved the antioxidant capacity, but had no influence on the total phenol or lycopene contents. It is concluded that grafting to the rootstock Terrano improves the nutritional quality of the fruit produced in both varieties of bell pepper studied...|$|R

Chlorophyll content and specific leaf area (SLA) were also evaluated. The effects of shade on leaf optical properties and chlorophyll content differed among the studied species, whereas increased SLA was a common response for all species, reflecting the occurrence of thinner leaves <b>under</b> <b>shade.</b> The three studied shade-tolerant species - Esenbeckia leiocarpa, Myroxylon peruiferum and Hymenaea courbaril - presented a greater PAR absorbance <b>under</b> <b>shade.</b> The response of the shade-intolerant species was varied.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of shade on growth and production of coffee plants. To achieve this, growth and productivity of coffee plants growing <b>under</b> <b>shade</b> trees were {{compared with those of}} coffee plants growing under direct sun light. Different physiological, environmental and quality parameters were assessed for both treatments. Shade trees protected coffee plants against adverse environmental stresses such as high soil temperatures and low relative humidity. Shade, however, also triggered differences in physiological behaviour of the coffee plants, such as improved photosynthesis and increased leaf area index, resulting in better performance than possible in direct sun light. Consequently, coffee plants grown <b>under</b> <b>shade</b> trees produced larger and heavier fruits with better bean quality than those grown in direct sun light. Moreover, shaded plants had greater biochemical and physiological potential for high dry matter production which would help them to maintain high coffee yields in the long term. If growing coffee <b>under</b> <b>shade</b> trees would allow other sources of income such as fruits, fuel wood and timber to be produced, it could be socially more acceptable, economically more viable and environmentally more sustainable. Since in Ethiopia people are moving towards replacing coffee by ‘chat’ and/or growing coffee in an open sun, we support the recommendations of growing coffee in the shade and suggest that the future research should be directed toward deterring the development of fungal diseases and increase of coffee yields <b>under</b> <b>shaded</b> conditions...|$|R
