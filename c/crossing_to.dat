5|$|After {{purchasing}} a decrepit yacht, the Granma, on 25 November 1956 Castro set sail from Tuxpan, Veracruz, with 81 revolutionaries armed with 90 rifles, 3 machine guns, around 40 pistols and 2 hand-held anti-tank guns. The 1,200 mile <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> Cuba was harsh, {{and in the}} overcrowded conditions of the ship, many suffered seasickness, and food supplies ran low. At some points they had to bail water caused by a leak, and at another a man fell overboard, delaying their journey. The plan had been for the <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> take 5 days, and on the ship's scheduled day of arrival, 30 November, MR-26-7 members under Frank Pais led an armed uprising against government buildings in Santiago, Manzanillo and several other towns. However, the Granmas journey ultimately lasted 7 days, and with Castro and his men unable to provide reinforcements, Pais and his militants dispersed {{after two days of}} intermittent attacks.|$|E
5|$|Nungesser {{had been}} {{planning}} an independent attempt at a solo <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> win the Orteig Prize, but initial discussions with designer Pierre Levasseur had led to the company owner insisting that Coli be considered as his navigator in a new two-place variant of the production Levasseur PL.4.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{returned}} to Nevada in March 1863, {{accompanied by a}} baby girl, named Margaret Persia Bowers. The Bowers never divulged where they had acquired the child.

5|$|The {{importance}} of the <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> vehicular traffic was underpinned when the Great Britain road numbering scheme was drawn up in the 1920s. The planners wished the arterial A9 road to be routed across the Forth here, although the unwillingness to have a ferry crossing {{as part of this}} route led to the A90 number being assigned instead.|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting to}} be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he {{composed}} a poem entitled The Lonely Isle, which was inspired by his feelings during the sea <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> Calais. To evade the British Army's postal censorship, he also developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.|$|E
5|$|Built {{predominantly}} of Old Red Sandstone, {{the bridge}} {{was the subject of}} significant reconstruction and rebuilding in the 18th and 19th centuries. In those centuries, it also became a popular subject for artists; Turner, Gastineau and Cotman produced sketches of the bridge and gate. In the 20th century, it suffered increasing damage as higher volumes of traffic and the use of ever-larger vehicles led to several serious accidents. In the 21st century, {{the construction of a new}} road <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> the south enabled the pedestrianisation of the bridge.|$|E

5|$|The Gulf Stream, {{together}} with its northern extension the North Atlantic Drift, is {{a warm and}} swift Atlantic ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and stretches {{to the tip of}} Florida, and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The process of western intensification causes the Gulf Stream to be a northward accelerating current off the east coast of North America. At about , it splits in two, with the northern stream, the North Atlantic Drift, <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> Northern Europe and the southern stream, the Canary Current, recirculating off West Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Alaska Railroad was completed in 1922, but by the 1930s, due to effects of the Great Depression, freight traffic declined on the railroad. In 1935, the Alaska Road Commission tried to force shippers to use the railroad, and raised the toll at the Tanana ferry <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> almost 10 dollars a ton. The truckers rebelled at this, with some violent skirmishes. Pirate ferry operations were started, lasting until the start of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{final section}} of the motorway, the northernmost section between the Umag {{interchange}} and the Slovenian border at Kaštel and Dragonja border crossing, is currently spanned by a two-lane connector road via a roundabout located at the provisional northern terminus of the A9. Since the Kaštel and Dragonja border crossing is the agreed contact point for the motorway link between Croatia and Slovenia, the section {{is expected to be}} built when Slovenia completes its H5 expressway; connecting the border <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> Koper and its motorway system. The Slovenian motorway development company DARS made plans in 2010 to build the expressway.|$|E

50|$|Another floor-crossing period {{occurred}} on 1-15 September 2004. 27 of the 32 NNP councillors <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> the ANC, giving the ANC {{a majority of}} 108 seats. 2 councillors of the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) also <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> the Federation of Democrats, a new party.|$|R
50|$|Three {{major roads}} meet in New Cross: the A202 (Queen's Road) which runs from New <b>Cross</b> <b>to</b> Victoria, the A2 (New Cross Road) which runs from London to Canterbury and Dover, and the A20 (Lewisham Way) which runs from New <b>Cross</b> <b>to</b> Folkestone and Dover.|$|R
5|$|The {{island is}} linked to the {{mainland}} by two ferries: a Caledonian MacBrayne vehicle ferry making the <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> Oban and a council passenger ferry making the shorter crossing from Point, at the north-eastern tip of the island, to Port Appin. The B8045 is the main road on the island, which it traverses from beyond Kilcheran in the SW, to Point in the NE.|$|E
5|$|The {{main road}} artery {{along the south}} Wales coast is the M4 motorway. It also {{provides}} a link to southern England, terminating in London. The section of the motorway managed by the Welsh Government runs from the Second Severn <b>Crossing</b> <b>to</b> Pont Abraham, Carmarthenshire, connecting the cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea. The A55 expressway has a similar role along the north Wales coast, connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to north-west England, principally Chester. The main north-south Wales link is the A470, which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno.|$|E
5|$|After {{making her}} way to New York, West Gate took on 6,700 tons of cargo that {{included}} locomotives, steel rails, and other materiel for the United States Army and departed in a convoy for France on 28 June. The ship soon developed engine trouble and {{dropped out of the}} convoy to head to St. John's, Newfoundland, for repairs. While headed to St. John's in moderate seas under a cloudy sky, West Gate was attacked by two German submarines at 19:15 on 3 July. One U-boat surfaced in front of the cargo ship, <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> starboard. As West Gate quickly turned to port to evade the U-boat, a second U-boat surfaced one point to starboard. While West Gates radio operator sent out a preemptive SOS, her gunners opened fire on the two submarines. Though her gunners made hits on neither boat, both were bracketed with fire, quickly submerged, and apparently departed the scene. West Gate arrived at St. John's at 18:00 on 7 July without any further contact with enemy vessels.|$|E

5|$|After tearfully reuniting {{with his}} son and new daughter-in-law, Walter discovers the device uses a unique {{radioactive}} signature that they can track. The strongest source points to a used campground, where Peter discovers a key. He recognizes the key as from Walter's old home near Reiden Lake and travels there alone, and finds his biological father, Walternate, present. Walternate admits to being behind the End of Dayers group, as his revenge for Peter activating the doomsday device and destroying the parallel world that was his home. Walternate promises that Peter will face the same pain and suffering he has faced since <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> the prime universe on a mission of mercy, one piece at a time. Peter realizes that Walternate is implying a threat to Olivia, and finds that Walternate was speaking to him remotely through a holographic simulation. In Central Park, where Moreau has set off another breach to expose an existing wormhole, Olivia is helping to cordon off the breach when Walternate approaches and shoots her. Peter {{and the rest of}} Fringe division struggle with her death at her funeral.|$|E
5|$|Although out {{of shape}} and with arthritic knees, Nash {{announced}} that he was making a football comeback in 1945. He sought to return to South Melbourne, rather than Camberwell, but Camberwell declined Nash's transfer application and both clubs stated that they would be naming Nash in their respective sides for Round 1. An impediment to Nash's return to South Melbourne arose as a result of Nash having played two games for his old boy scout troop, the 6th Melbourne Scouts, while on leave in mid-1942; these games were considered competitive, and playing in them meant that Nash had not sat out of football for the three years required to serve the suspension he had received for <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> Camberwell without a clearance. After an appeal by South Melbourne, a special meeting of the VFL was held to amend the rules so ex-servicemen would not be penalised for playing in minor matches. The amendment was made the day before the commencement of the 1945 season, allowing Nash to take his place for South Melbourne in their Round 1.|$|E
5|$|At the conference, {{in light}} of the little {{information}} available on Egyptian dispositions and intentions, and due to a shortage of infantry and artillery, the commanders agreed they could not relieve the surrounded strongpoints on the canal in the near future. There was a general consensus to attack Egyptian forces throwing them off balance, but disagreed on how to do so. Southern Command expected to have 640 tanks on Monday October 8, of which 530 tanks would be distributed among three divisions: 200 tanks under Adan, 180 under Sharon, and 150 under Mandler after part of his losses were replaced. Estimates put the number of Egyptian tanks at 400, when there were in fact 800 tanks across the canal by Sunday evening. In light of the apparent superiority, Gonen recommended a frontal attack at night with Adan's 162nd Division <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> the west bank at El-Qantarah and Sharon's 143rd Division crossing into Suez City. Adan however, lacking infantry, urged a cautious approach until more reserves reached the front.|$|E

5|$|Construction was {{approved}} in April 1971, {{with an initial}} expected opening date in 1976. Work was delayed {{due to a lack}} of funds, which was resolved by EEC funding granted in 1974. The second tunnel opened in May 1980, allowing each tunnel to handle one direction of traffic, by which time the joint capacity of the two tunnels had increased to 65,000 vehicles per day. Connection of the <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> the M25 was completed on the northerly Essex side in September 1982 (Junction 31), and to the southerly Kent side in September 1986 (Junction 1a). Following the completion of the M25 in 1986, the daily demand had grown to 79,000 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the course}} of the {{enlarged}} South Drain, a lock raised the level of the canal at Shapwick, while the Drain turned off to run parallel to the canal but to its north. The railway ran between the two waterways, <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> {{the south side of the}} canal immediately after the single arched aqueduct and syphon over the South Drain. The remains of the three-arched aqueduct and syphon over the River Brue are still visible, near the old railway bridge, and from there the canal headed towards Glastonbury, passing the Ham Wall and Street Heath nature reserves and making a sharp right-hand turn just before its terminal basin, which was located near the old Glastonbury and Street railway station.|$|E
5|$|From there, Crash {{crosses to}} the second of Cortex's islands. Wumpa Island, hosting a large tree, has been long {{abandoned}} {{and there is nothing}} more than a jungle, a lizard-infested city, dilapidated bridges high in the mountains, and the ruins of an ancient temple. However, having discovered that Crash is making his way across the islands, Cortex dispatches the deranged Ripper Roo on the island in a temple at the start of a creek. Crash manages to cross the river and, after avoiding contact with his razor-sharp toenails, knocks Ripper Roo out cold beside a waterfall, and successfully makes his way through the city and the temples. Crash also defeats another of Cortex's mutants, the muscular Koala Kong, in a volcanic cave mine before finally <b>crossing</b> <b>to</b> the Cortex Island. Crash then navigates the Cortex Power station, a huge power plant that provides Cortex's castle with energy while polluting the nearby area. When he reaches the factory core, Crash battles and defeats the CEO of Cortex Power, Pinstripe Potoroo, damaging the power plant.|$|E
