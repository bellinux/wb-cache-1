5|$|Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King {{had invited}} Macdonald {{to run for}} federal office during the general {{election}} of 1935. Although Macdonald turned him down, there were strong rumours in 1937 that Macdonald would soon enter federal politics. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes however, that Macdonald wanted to remain as premier so he <b>could</b> <b>present</b> Nova Scotia's case to a Royal Commission on federal-provincial relations.|$|E
5|$|Judicial oratory {{had become}} a {{significant}} literary genre by {{the second half of}} the fifth century, as represented in the speeches of Demosthenes' predecessors, Antiphon and Andocides. Logographers were a unique aspect of the Athenian justice system: evidence for a case was compiled by a magistrate in a preliminary hearing and litigants <b>could</b> <b>present</b> it as they pleased within set speeches; however, witnesses and documents were popularly mistrusted (since they could be secured by force or bribery), there was little cross-examination during the trial, there were no instructions to the jury from a judge, no conferencing between jurists before voting, the juries were huge (typically between 201 and 501 members), cases depended largely on questions of probable motive, and notions of natural justice were felt to take precedence over written law—conditions that favoured artfully constructed speeches.* H. Yunis, Demosthenes: On The Crown, 263 (note 275).|$|E

5|$|Predation in {{the wild}} appears to be very rare for ruffed lemurs, {{probably}} because living in the high canopy makes them challenging to catch. Evidence of predation by raptors, such as the Henst's goshawk (Accipiter henstii) suggests it occurs at a low rate. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) <b>could</b> <b>present</b> a potential risk if it found an individual lower in the forest canopy, but no confirmation has been presented to indicate that they prey upon ruffed lemurs. Instead, only re-introduced, captive-bred ruffed lemurs {{have been killed by}} fossa, likely due to their inexperience with predators. Nesting behavior poses the biggest risk of predation, making them susceptible to carnivorous mammals, such as the ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) and brown-tailed mongoose (Salanoia concolor).|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fall of Phnom Penh to Vietnamese forces and their Kampuchean allies in January 1979, representatives of Democratic Kampuchea called for an {{emergency}} meeting of the United Nations Security Council, so Prince Norodom Sihanouk <b>could</b> <b>present</b> the deposed regime's case. Despite strong objections from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, the UN Security Council gave Sihanouk this chance. Although Sihanouk distanced himself from the human rights abuses of the Khmer Rouge, he accused Vietnam of using aggression to violate Kampuchea’s sovereignty. As such, he demanded all UN countries to suspend aid to Vietnam and not recognise the Vietnamese-installed regime. Subsequently, seven non-aligned members of the UN Security Council submitted a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea, which was endorsed by the People's Republic of China, France, Norway, Portugal, the United States and the United Kingdom. However, the resolution was not approved due to strong opposition from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Ted Galen Carpenter, a foreign policy analyst from the Cato Institute argues that Vietnam did not invade Cambodia out of any noble desire to stop the atrocities committed by Pol Pot's regime but rather to consolidate their domination of Indochina.|$|E

25|$|Layman {{only had}} time to make changes to Ravens armament. He closed the two {{foremost}} ports and replaced their guns with a single 68-pounder carronade that he mounted on a traverse carriage (i.e., pivot-mounted) immediately before the foremast {{in a way that}} it could fire over the gunwales. Similarly, a second 68-pounder, also mounted on a traverse, replaced the two stern chasers. Should gunboats threaten a becalmed Raven, she <b>could</b> <b>present</b> a powerful response on any azimuth.|$|E
25|$|All settlers, whether full {{members or}} not, were {{required}} to attend church services and were subject to church discipline. The Lord's Supper, however, was reserved to full members only. While Congregational churches practiced infant baptism, only full members <b>could</b> <b>present</b> their children for baptism. It was believed that the children of church members already shared in their parent's covenant relationship with the church, and they therefore {{had a right to}} baptism by virtue of being born into a Christian household.|$|E

Johnson died before {{he was able to}} meet with Nixon. However, under Middleton's direction, the Library established a reputation of leadership in declassification and openness, declassifying and opening hundreds of thousands of pages of historical material.|$|E

Only one athlete, United States-based long jumper Darya Klishina, met the criteria and was allowed to compete. Her selection garnered negative press in her home country. The situation led pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva, one of Russia's top athletes, to announce her intention to stand for ARAF President to resolve the crisis.|$|E
25|$|The Public Library Acts of 1855 and 1866 {{were the}} last to be {{advanced}} by William Ewart, who retired in 1868. He had made great efforts to promote the public library system in Great Britain and perhaps his greatest achievement was the complete elimination of the population limits, as it allowed even very small towns or parishes {{to set up a}} public library. It was later found that this <b>could</b> <b>present</b> a problem, but as many public libraries were established by library authorities that did not in fact have enough money to run a library satisfactorily.|$|E
25|$|Regardless {{the type}} of patrol, a night march would {{normally}} {{be made to the}} area. Conditions could make this task most difficult, especially when it was so dark that the troopies were completely blind. Scarcity of water <b>could</b> <b>present</b> an issue to the patrol. The civilians were not regarded as hostiles by the troops. There were numerous occasions when they helped each other and process of great empathy took place. If a patrol learned of enemy presence the patrol force immediately moved to engage the enemy. On occasions the patrols were ambushed. Patrols in Mozambique were considered the most hazardous, due to the violent reaction of FRELIMO (also known as FPML).|$|E

25|$|In 1825, Mexican {{authorities}} {{became concerned}} with the actions of empresario Haden Edwards in Nacogdoches. Edwards had threatened to confiscate the land of any Mexican already living {{in the area in}} which he planned to bring settlers unless the Mexicans <b>could</b> <b>present</b> written deeds to the property. Mexican authorities promptly told him {{that he did not have}} the authority to confiscate land and he should honor the claims of the previous settlers. After multiple confrontations, on December 16, 1826, Edwards, his brothers, and 30settlers issued a declaration of independence and called themselves the Republic of Fredonia. Other empresarios disassociated themselves from Edwards, and Austin sent 250militiamen to Nacogdoches to help the Mexican forces quell the revolt. Edwards was finally forced to flee Mexican territory.|$|E
25|$|When Japanese {{troops were}} about to take Fengyang, Ji's father, Ji Gongquan, had assumed that the {{occupation}} authorities knew of his Japanese education. To avoid being coerced into joining the government, Ji Gongquan and his family fled to Hankow, which became the temporary national capital {{after the fall of}} Nanjing. Ji Gongquan became frustrated with Chiang Kai-shek, so Chaoding, who was then in China doing research, arranged the difficult passage through South China and Hanoi as the family made their way to New York. Chaoding had planned to go to the wartime communist capital in Yan'an, but Zhou Enlai asked him to instead accompany his family to the United States, where he <b>could</b> <b>present</b> sympathetic information while not revealing his political allegiance. Ji continued his work with the IPR and the magazine Amerasia.|$|E
25|$|Mock bombardments of {{imaginary}} shore {{positions were}} carried out by Prince David in Saanich Inlet, and equally imaginary shore batteries fired back, while movie raiders rowed the ship's boats ashore {{as hard as they}} could. A ship-handling problem peculiar to this operation was that in every scene where Prince David was to appear herself, she <b>could</b> <b>present</b> only her starboard side to the camera. It was calculated that cinema-goers would not likely accept the huge sound truck that had been hoisted aboard, and reposed on the weather deck port side, as a regular item in Combined Operations weaponry. The ship's company co-operated heartily, and kept up a high standard of discipline and war-readiness despite the distractions of this fling with film fame, and the glitter of hob-nobbing with the film famous.|$|E
