40|$|Knowledge of the {{particle}} size distribution is {{required in order to}} predict ultrasonic absorption in polydisperse particulate suspensions. This paper shows that the method used to measure {{the particle}} size distribution can lead to important differences in the predicted absorption. A reverberation technique developed for measuring ultrasonic absorption by suspended particles is used to measure the absorption in suspensions of nonspherical particles. Two types of particulates are studied: (i) kaolin (china clay) particles which are platelike in form; and (ii) calcium carbonate particles which are more granular.

The {{particle size distribution}}s, which are required for these predictions, are measured by laser diffraction, gravitational sedimentation and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>sedimentation,</b> all of which assume spherical particles. For a given sample, each sizing technique yields a different size distribution, leading to differences in the predicted absorption.

40|$|Many {{applications}} {{require the}} dispersion of carbon nanotubes in anorganic or organic solvents. The dispersion comprises homogenization, des-agglomeration and stabilization by mechanical and/or chemical techniques. Functionalization is a chemical method to modify carbon nanotube surfaces {{to enhance the}} incorporation of the particles into a surrounding matrix material and hence, can improve the dispersion behavior. In this work, the dispersing behavior of non-modified in comparison with functionalized carbon nanotubes has been investigated. Therefore, carbon nanotubes have been dispersed by an ultrasonication process in the aqueous phase and tetrahydrofuran. Particularly, several carbon nanotube modifications with oxygen, carboxyl and nitrogen {{groups as well as}} polymer grafted poly(glycidyl methacrylateco-methyl methacrylate) carbon nanotubes have been processed. The achieved dispersions have been characterized by the sedimentation behavior in the <b>centrifugal</b> field. Improved <b>sedimentation</b> stabilities of the functionalized in comparison with the corresponding non-modified carbon nanotubes could be identified. The advanced sedimentation stability of modified carbon nanotubes implies either a highly flocculated and aggregated suspension structure or the assistance of the dispersion process by the surface modification...|$|R
