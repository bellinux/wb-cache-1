50|$|Juncus conglomeratus, known {{commonly}} as <b>compact</b> <b>rush,</b> is a perennial, herbaceous {{flowering plant}} {{species in the}} rush family Juncaceae.|$|E
50|$|In the {{southern}} part of the site soil drainage is impeded which has caused a significant area of mixed humid heath and acidic grassland to thrive. The main flora present in this part of the site are purple moor-grass, cross-leaved heath, degenerate heather, heath rush, <b>compact</b> <b>rush,</b> green-ribbed sedge and crowberry.|$|E
50|$|The {{steep hill}} is wooded with open {{grassland}} at the top. The site has many ancient trees, {{but the main}} ones are hybrid black-poplar and London plane, the result of former landscaping. There are also wild service trees and midland hawthorns. The ground flora includes bluebells, heath grass and <b>compact</b> <b>rush.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During the Middle Ages {{the floors}} of most churches and {{dwellings}} consisted of <b>compacted</b> earth, and <b>rushes</b> (commonly [...] "sweet flag" [...] Acorus calamus) or other herbs and grasses were strewn over {{them to provide}} a sweet smelling, renewable covering for insulation. The Household roll of Edward II (1307-1327) shows a payment to a John de Carlford for [...] "a supply of rushes for strewing the Kings chamber". In the Churchwardens' accounts for St Mary-at-Hill, London, payments of 3d for rushes are shown for 1493 and 1504, and in the parish register of the church at Kirkham, Lancashire, disbursements for rushes are found in 1604 and 1631 for 9s 6d, but not after 1634 when the church floor was flagged. At Saddleworth (then in Yorkshire) the church floor was covered with rushes until 1826.|$|R
50|$|A poorly drained {{section of}} the {{northern}} field supports <b>compact</b> <b>rush</b> (Juncus conglomeratus) and several sedges including glaucous sedge (Carex flacca), common sedge (C. nigra), oval sedge (C. ovalis) and pale sedge (C. pallescens), with marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi), meadowsweet, greater birdâ€™s-foot trefoil (Lotus uliginosus) and common spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii).|$|E
50|$|Rich {{wetlands}} occur {{especially at}} {{the east of the}} moors and have species mixes arising in part out of the effects of a limestone understratum dominated by purple moor-grass with, in less-grazed areas, bog-myrtle (Myrica gale), and in more-grazed areas, cross-leaved heath and tormentil, with sweet vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), <b>compact</b> <b>rush</b> (Juncus conglomeratus), sneezewort (Achillea ptramica), marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre) and wild angelica (Angelica sylvestris), and limestone indicators including carnation, glaucous and flea sedges (Carex panicea, C. flacca and C. pulicaris), fen bedstraw (Galium uliginosum), tufted vetch (Vicia cracca) and moss (Hylocomium splendens).|$|E
