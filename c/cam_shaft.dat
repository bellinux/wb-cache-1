25|$|On current Ducati motors, {{except for}} the Desmosedici and 1199 Panigale, the valves are {{actuated}} by a standard valve <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> which is rotated by a timing belt driven by the motor directly. The teeth on the belt keep the camshaft drive pulleys indexed. On older Ducati motors, prior to 1986, drive was by solid shaft that transferred to the camshaft through bevel-cut gears. This method of valve actuation was used on many of Ducati's older single-cylinder motorcycles — the shaft tube is visible {{on the outside of}} the cylinder.|$|E

50|$|For 2010 season, {{the short}} {{wheelbase}} version was called Formula Rolon 2010 {{and used a}} 1300cc 16 valve engines from Suzuki Swift. The 1.3 liter Suzuki engines had modified cylinder heads, race tuned free flow exhausts and high lift <b>cam</b> <b>shafts</b> modified to race specifications producing over 40% more power than the factory stock versions. The engine management systems were supplied by Race Dynamics of Bangalore with a programmable Fuel Injection system.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] model {{uses the}} same Duratec block, but is not as heavily modified. The {{connecting}} rods and pistons are not upgraded significantly, though it does have the dry-sump system. The <b>cam</b> <b>shafts</b> are slightly radicalized, and the exhaust system is upgraded. The inlet system is enlarged, but not replaced with the roller-barrel system. The computer chip is upgraded, {{but not to the}} extent of the 260 model. Generally speaking, the 200 model is upgraded, albeit not as heavily.|$|R

5000|$|Kawasaki {{introduced}} the Concours in 1986, {{based on their}} Ninja 900 and Ninja 1000R models. Key differences between the Ninja 1000R and the ZG1000 included 32 mm instead of 36 mm carburetors, less aggressively ramped <b>cams,</b> <b>shaft</b> drive, front and rear sub-frames, hard luggage, and full fairing. The Concours was introduced into the USA {{the year after the}} slightly faster (137 mph) BMW K100LT at less than two-thirds the price of the BMW machine. Both bikes were tested by the magazine Motorcyclist, which came out in favor of the Kawasaki concluding that it was [...] "the most practical, useful and competent motorcycle made" [...] and [...] "superior to the BMW in almost every aspect imaginable." ...|$|R
2500|$|The [...] Cosworth-tuned {{engine is}} heavily {{modified}} from the stock 2.3 litre Duratec. The cylinder head, block, crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons are upgraded by Cosworth. Cosworth also integrates an advanced dry-sump {{with an extra}} internal scavenge pump to distribute the oil. While a dry-sump system requires more oil (more weight), a dry-sump will keep the engine lubricated under hard cornering unlike a wet-sump system. Cosworth also radicalizes the <b>cam</b> <b>shafts</b> and upgrades the exhaust system. This may cause the engine to run a little more [...] "rough" [...] at low RPMs, but it drastically increases performance. The inlet system is also replaced with an advanced, custom roller-barrel system. This increases airflow at full throttle compared to a butterfly inlet, boosting performance. The engine also has a custom chip designed by Cosworth for a further increase in performance.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{incarnation}} of the 128 SOHC engine was modified to utilise 16 valves and dual <b>cam</b> <b>shafts.</b> The engine (using the designation [...] "Torque") featured the bore-spacing, bore and stroke of the 1580 cc 159/160 series engine with a new 16 valve DOHC cylinder-head. To incorporate the extra oil-return-paths and symmetrical head (as opposed to the asymmetrical SOHC head) the cylinder-block was slightly revised making the DOHC head non-interchangeable with the previous incarnations of the 128 engine. The [...] "Torque" [...] engine (178.B3 - 182.A4) powered the Brava/Bravo, Marea and Multipla Fiat automobiles {{as well as the}} second-generation Lancia Delta (never sold in the UK), finally ending production in 1999 for the European market. In Argentina it remained on production until 2002 mostly exported to be fitted into Brazilian-made versions of the Brava, Palio, Siena, Strada and Doblò.|$|R
5000|$|The second-generation Chevrolet Big-Block {{engine was}} {{introduced}} at the 1963 Daytona 500 as the Mark II. The block entered production in mid 1965 as the Mark IV 396 cubic inch [...] "Turbo-Jet," [...] phasing out the first-generation Y Series Big-Block. In {{its first year}} the 396 was available as the L78 option in Corvettes and full-sized (Impala, Bel Air, Biscayne) models, and as the L37 in the intermediate (Chevelle) model. These engines differed only in that the L78 had a solid-lifter <b>cam</b> <b>shaft,</b> while the L37 had an hydraulic-lifter <b>cam</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{components}} such as <b>cam</b> <b>shafts</b> {{and ring}} gears often {{need to have}} a hard outer surface for wear resistance and a good internal toughness to resist deformation due to impact and loading. These two properties, however, are often mutually exclusive. Case hardening is one solution whereby carbon diffusion into steel results in hardened surface and near-surface layers. Wear resistance is improved while maintaining the bulk toughness of the component. As with many production processes, it is necessary to monitor the quality of the components being manufactured, with case hardening, it is the depth of treatment that is normally measured. Conventional case-depth measurements are destructive, time-consuming, and expensive. Although eddy-current techniques have been applied to the problem [1], the process is often cumbersome due to the need to use more than one frequency. In this paper we investigate how magnetic nondestructive measurement techniques can be used to form the basis of an NDE tool that can quickly and reliably determine case depth from surface measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} {{performed by}} many objects {{can be expressed}} in terms of the constraints they impose on the motions of other objects. <b>Cam</b> <b>shafts,</b> gears, fixtures, wrenches and doorknobs are all examples of a class of objects whose shapes are designed to interact in ways that constrain their relative motion. This report examines an approach to the analysis and design of functional shape interactions represented as motion constraints. In this approach, a graphical representation for motion constraints is used as the basis for visualizing and reasoning about the function derived from shape. This representation also serves as an environment for the interactive design of functional shapes. Specifically, we utilize the configuration space representation to make explicit the motion constraints imposed by the shapes of interacting objects. We have developed a set of computational tools that permits these motion constraints to be displayed and directly manipulated by a designer in order to achieve d [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Post INRC, most top drivers {{switched}} to the Maruti Gypsy for its off-road and Four-wheel drive capabilities. The highly modified Group A (II) IND category allowed tuners the flexibility to choose between {{a wide range of}} <b>cam</b> <b>shafts,</b> tuned exhausts and heavily modified cylinder heads. Till 1992, MRF was the principal choice of tyres for most Maruti Gypsys and twin Weber carburetors were the preferred choice for the fully modified class. For the 1994 season S. Karivardhan opted for computer programmable Electronic Fuel Injection for Hari Singh's Team JK Gypsy and they were dominant during that period, prompting N. Leelakrishnan to follow suit in EFI systems for his Rally cars. Alarmed at the high budgets and top speeds of the top runners, FMSCI for 1996 season finally outlawed the Group A (II) IND category and reverted to Group A (I) IND category which restricted engine modifications and the regular stock Group N category. The loud intake and screaming exhaust note with crackling backfire were missed by many rally fans.|$|R
50|$|The M-Stock trains (now CM-Stock trains) {{were the}} first batch of trains ordered by MTR. They were {{delivered}} from 1979-1982, and had their traction systems changed to GTO Chopper from <b>Cam</b> <b>Shaft</b> in 1992-1995. They serve on the Kwun Tong Line.|$|E

50|$|The TS series {{engines are}} all '4-cylinder inline' with twin <b>cam</b> (DOHC) <b>shafts.</b> The {{original}} 8-valve engine {{was derived from}} Alfa's Twin Cam family, and featured a light alloy (Si enhanced aluminium alloy) block + head, wet-cooled iron cylinder liners, and the camshafts were driven by single double row timing chain. So, similar design to the earlier and famous Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engines, but with narrower valve angle and double ignition on this model.|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{camshafts}} {{are made}} from grey cast iron. They were produced from such a single material {{and needed to be}} laboriousley refined. The camshaft realized in the project "Manufacturing Technology Adhesive Bonding" shows sinter cam bonded on the steel shaft using anaerobic adhesive.

The cohesional and adhesional stability have been investigated...|$|R
40|$|Many {{engineering}} {{materials can}} be characterized by set of properties and these are varied. Heat treatment is a controlled heating, cooling of metals {{for the purpose of}} altering their properties and can perform their function without a concurrent change in the product shape. Both physical and chemical properties can altered by heat treatment such as case hardening. This method is particularly useful for improving resistance to the surface indentation fatigue and wear. Some of the applications of these case hardening are gear teeth, milling cutters, <b>cams,</b> <b>shafts,</b> bearings, cutting tools and dies. through hardening of these parts would not be desirable. The hard part must be the necessary toughness, impact resistance, corrosive wear and for this application, some surface crack can propagate rapidly through the part and cause the total failure. Hardfacing is the deposition of different metal over the parent metal to achieve required properties. Alloys can be added by various ways to hardfacing surface by various means,such as incorporating in the powdered form in flux and making electrodes of alloying elements. The alloying elements can be selected according to purpose such as chromium, vanadium, tungsten etc carbide alloys offer excellent abrasion resistance and good heat resistance...|$|R
