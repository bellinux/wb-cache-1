Ivan Fellegi, the former <b>Chief</b> <b>Statistician</b> of Canada, criticized the government's decision, saying {{that those who are}} most vulnerable (such as the poor, new immigrants, and aboriginals) are least likely to respond to a voluntary form, which weakens information about their demographic.|$|E
5|$|Since 1954, a {{year ahead}} of the 1955 general election, an Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) has been {{appointed}} to advise the executive on the number and geographical division of electoral divisions. Even though neither the Constitution nor any law requires this to be done, the Prime Minister has continued to do so from Singapore's independence in 1965. This is generally done just before a general election to review the boundaries of electoral divisions and recommend changes. In recent decades, the Committee has been chaired by the Cabinet Secretary and has had four other members who are senior public servants. In the EBRC appointed before the general election of 2006, these were {{the head of the}} Elections Department, the Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore Land Authority, the Deputy CEO of the Housing and Development Board and the Acting <b>Chief</b> <b>Statistician.</b> Since the Committee is only convened shortly before general elections, the preparatory work for boundary delimitation is done by its secretariat the Elections Department, which is a division of the Prime Minister's Office.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the start, Seymour Siwoff, the Elias Sports Bureau <b>chief</b> and {{official}} <b>statistician</b> for MLB, {{determined that the}} official method of accounting for consecutive scoreless innings would only count whole innings for starting pitchers and that if the streak extended into 1989 it would bear an asterisk. Previously there had been division among various sources on whether to include fractional innings. According to some sources, official statisticians such as Siwoff {{had a long history}} of only counting complete scoreless innings by starting pitchers. Hershiser's September 23 shutout moved him to third on the all-time consecutive scoreless innings list, behind Johnson and Drysdale. He also passed Carl Hubbell and G.

Hershiser also became one of three pitchers to throw five consecutive shutouts, joining Drysdale, who did it in 1968 and White, who did it in 1904.

40|$|Background: The Adjunctive Corticosteroid Treatment in Critically Ill Patients with Septic Shock (ADRENAL) trial, a 3800 -patient, multicentre, {{randomised}} controlled trial, will be {{the largest}} study to date of corticosteroid therapy in patients with septic shock. Objective: To describe a statistical analysis plan (SAP) and make it public before completion of patient recruitment and data collection. The SAP will be adhered to for the final data analysis of this trial, to avoid analysis bias arising from knowledge of study findings. Methods: The SAP was designed by the <b>chief</b> investigators and <b>statisticians</b> and approved by the ADRENAL management committee. All authors were blind to treatment allocation and to the unblinded data produced during two interim analyses conducted by the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee. The data shells were produced from a previously published protocol. Statistical analyses are described in broad detail. Trial outcomes were selected and categorised into primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes, and appropriate statistical comparisons between groups are planned and described {{in a way that is}} transparent, available to the public, verifiable and determined before completion of data collection. Results: We developed a standard SAP for the ADRENAL trial, and have produced a trial profile outline and list of mock tables. We describe analyses of baseline characteristics, processes of care, measures of efficacy and outcomes. Six pre-specified subgroups were defined, and statistical comparisons between groups in these subgroups are described. Conclusion: We have developed an SAP for the ADRENAL trial. This plan accords with high-quality standards of internal validity to minimise analysis bias...|$|R
