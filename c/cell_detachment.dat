A series of 58 malignant specimens, comprised of primary tumours and metastases, were desmosome positive. There was no indication of a comparative reduction in desmosome expression that might give rise to reduced adhesiveness of tumour cells, although loss of polarised junctional distribution in poorly differentiated tumours might have such a consequence. Western blotting analysis of colorectal cancers and cultured carcinoma cells identified desmosomal polypeptides dpl + 2, dgl and dg 2 + 3 with similar relative molecular weights to normal homologues.

40|$|It {{is assumed}} that plasmin participates in pericellular {{proteolysis}} in the epidermis. Plasmin is generated by keratinocyte-associated plasminogen activators from the proenzyme plasminogen; plasminogen activation can proceed at the keratinocyte surface.

Here we describe the receptor for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA-R) in the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, which serves to direct plasminogen activation to the cell surface; we relate the receptor to the uPA-R previously described in human myclo-/monocytes. Binding of uPA to the receptor accelerated plasminogen activation {{by a factor of}} [approximate] 10, compared to uPA in solution.

40|$|Summary Tumour <b>cell</b> adhesion, <b>detachment</b> and {{aggregation}} seem to play {{an important}} part in tumour invasion and metastasis, and numerous cell adhesion molecules are expressed by tumour cells. Several families of cell-cell adhesion molecules have been described, of which two groups are particularly well characterised, the cadherin family and the Ig superfamily member, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). We investigated expression of these two adhesion molecule families in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines and xenografts by immunoblotting. Nineteen tumours established from 15 patients with SCLC were examined. All tumours but one expressed both cadherin and NCAM. The tumours expressed one, two or rarely three cadherin bands, and different combinations of two major isoforms of NCAM with Mr'S of approximately 190, 000 and 135, 000.

In this study, Guan and colleagues investigated novel upstream regulators of the Hippo signaling pathway and found that <b>cell</b> <b>detachment</b> activates the Hippo pathway kinase Lats 1 / 2. In addition, they show that Lats 1 / 2 activation is controlled by actin and microtubule reorganization in response to <b>cell</b> <b>detachment,</b> and subsequent YAP phosphorylation and inactivation by Lats 1 / 2 is required for anoikis. Thus, these findings delineate novel pathways regulating anoikis and novel functions for the Hippo pathway...|$|E
40|$|Neutrophil-mediated endothelial {{injury was}} {{assessed}} in vitro using assays of cell lysis and <b>cell</b> <b>detachment.</b> Activation of human peripheral blood neutrophils adherent to human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers by serum-treated zymosan produced dose-dependent endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>detachment</b> without concomitant cell lysis. This injury was inhibited by neutral protease inhibitors, {{but not by}} catalase or superoxide dismutase. Neutrophils from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease also produced endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>detachment</b> when activated by serum-treated zymosan similar to normal neutrophils. Endothelial detachment was also produced by cell-free postsecretory media from activated neutrophils or by partially purified human neutrophil granule fraction and was inhibitable by tryptic, elastase, and serine protease inhibitors, but not by an acid protease inhibitor. Analysis of iodinated endothelial cell surface proteins that {{had been exposed to}} partially purified neutrophil granule fraction showed complete loss of proteins migrating in the region of fibronectin by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This result was prevented in the presence of neutral protease inhibitors. We conclude that neutrophil-derived neutral proteases mediate endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>detachment</b> in vitro through digestion of endothelial cell surface proteins including fibronectin...|$|E
50|$|Nowadays, it is {{specialized}} in non conventional warfare, performing psychological operations and harassing bigger enemy units, such as Brigades and Divisions. Acting in smalls <b>cells</b> and <b>detachments</b> (usually {{no more than}} 20 men), the Special Forces act deep behind enemy lines, and are capable of fighting in extremely unfavorable situations.For its creation, the Army Command issued decrees organizing {{the core of the}} Brigade (Nu Bda Op Esp), reporting initially to the Brigade Parachute Infantry. Most of its subordinate organizations were stationed in the area of Camboatá (West Zone of Rio de Janeiro), where he was the 1st BFEsp, whose commander served, cumulatively, in the initial phase, the command of Nu Bda Op Esp and management of project deployment.|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{efforts have}} been made to develop small-diameter tissue {{engineered}} vascular grafts using a great variety of bioreactor systems at different steps of processing. Nevertheless, there is still an extensive need for a compact all-in-one system providing multiple and simultaneous processing. The aim of this project was to develop a new device to fulfill the major requirements of an ideal system that allows simultaneous seeding, conditioning, and perfusion. The newly developed system can be actuated in a common incubator and consists of six components: a rotating cylinder, a pump, a pulse generator, a control unit, a mixer, and a reservoir. Components that are in direct contact with cell media, cells, and/or tissue allow sterile processing. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed with polyurethane tubes and collagen tubes. The scaffolds were seeded with fibroblasts and endothelial cells that were isolated from human saphenous vein segments. Scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry showed better seeding success of polyurethane scaffolds in comparison to collagen. Conditioning of polyurethane tubes with 100 dyn/cm 2 resulted in <b>cell</b> <b>detachments,</b> whereas a moderate conditioning program with stepwise increase of shear stress from 10 to 40 dyn/cm 2 induced a stable and confluent cell layer. The new bioreactor is a powerful tool for quick and easy testing of various scaffold materials for the development of tissue engineered vascular grafts. The combination of this bioreactor with native tissue allows testing of medical devices and medicinal substances under physiological conditions that is a good step towards reduction of animal testing. In the long run, the bioreactor could turn out to produce tissue engineered vascular grafts for human applications “at the bedside”...|$|R
40|$|<b>Detachment</b> of {{epithelial}} <b>cells</b> {{from the}} extracellular matrix (ECM) {{results in a}} form of apoptosis {{often referred to as}} anoikis. Transformation of intestinal epithelial cells by oncogenic ras leads to resistance to anoikis, and this resistance is required for the full manifestation of the malignant phenotype. Previously, we demonstrated that ras-induced inhibition of anoikis in intestinal epithelial cells results, in part, from the ras-induced constitutive downregulation of Bak, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl- 2 family. Since exogenous Bak could only partially restore susceptibility to anoikis in the ras-transformed cells, the existence of at least another component of the apoptotic machinery mediating the effect of activated ras on anoikis was suggested. Indeed, here we show that, in nonmalignant rat and human intestinal epithelial <b>cells,</b> <b>detachment</b> from the ECM or disruption of the cytoskeleton results in a significant downregulation of the antiapoptotic effector Bcl-XL, and that activated H- or K-ras oncogenes completely abrogate this downregulation. In addition, we found that enforced downregulation of Bcl-XL in the ras-transformed cells promotes anoikis and significantly inhibits tumorigenicity, indicating that disruption of the adhesion-dependent regulation of Bcl-XL {{is an essential part of}} the molecular changes associated with transformation by ras. While the ras-induced downregulation of Bak could be reversed by pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI 3 -kinase), the effect of ras on Bcl-XL was PI 3 -kinase– and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) –independent. We conclude that ras-induced resistance to anoikis in intestinal epithelial cells is mediated by at least two distinct mechanisms: one that triggers downregulation of Bak and another that stabilizes Bcl-XL expression in the absence of the ECM...|$|R
