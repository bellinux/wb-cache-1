40|$|Using {{sea sand}} and <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> is the {{distinctive}} feature of concrete in Okinawa Prefecture. The characteristics of such concrete has already published in many papers by the auther and others. There {{are two kinds}} of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> used in Okinawa Island. One is hard and called "Motobu" <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> and has large density and small specific water content. So the static and dynamic Young's maduli of the concrete which uses Motobu <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> are much larger than ones which described in the specifications of AIJ and JSCE in the practical range of compressive strength between 150 and 400 kg/cm². The other is relatively soft and called Ryukyu lime <b>stone</b> <b>crushed</b> <b>stone.</b> The concrete using the relatively soft <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> has smaller Young's moduli than the concrete with Motobu <b>crushed</b> <b>stone,</b> but still lightly larger than specified values in the AIJ specification. There are many factors which affect the values of the Young's maduli of concrete. In this study, compressive strength and unit weight of concrete are the most affecting factors. Formulae for both static and dynamic Young's moduli are presented by using the method of the least square. The formulae are described in terms of compressive strength and unit weight of concrete. The increasing pattern of compressing strength of the concrete using hard <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> as the time passes is almost the same as described in common technical books. The rate of increase of Young's moduli as the time passes is much slower than ones of compressive strength. The concrete using larger maximum size <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> exhibits much larger Young's moduli than the concrete with small maximum size. Bleeding behavior of the concrete using <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> and sea sand will be much improved by using "Ishigū" as a part of fine aggregate.

(2) While the compressive strain is greater than a certain value, the compressive strength of GCSL increases significantly with the increase of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> content. (3) Under a larger compressive strain, the <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> inclusions improve apparently the compressive property of GCSL with closely spaced geogrid-reinforcement layers due to the interlocking between the <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> and the geogrid...|$|R
