40|$|A major {{metabolite}} of <b>ciclobendazole</b> (methyl 5 -cyclopropylcarbonyl- 2 -benzimidazolecarba-mate) excreted in the urine, bile, and feces of rats was methyl 5 -cyclopropylcarbonyl- 6 -hydroxy-benzimidazolecarbamate, {{established by}} {{comparison of the}} proton magnetic resonance and mass spectra {{with that of the}} authentic compound. This compound represented 8. 2 % and 7. 1 % of the dose, respectively, in extracts of 24 -hr urine and 48 -hr feces samples of rats, but was only a minor metabolite in dog urine (1 % of the dose). The unchanged drug was only detected in dog feces, the major route of excretion of radioactivity in the dog. 5 -Cyclopropylcarbonyl- 2 -amino-benzimidazole was present in rat urine (2. 5 % of the dose). A major metabolite in dog bile was probably 5 -cyclopropylcarbinol- 2 -aminobenzimidazole, formed by loss of the methoxycarbonyl group and reduction of the carbonyl function in the 5 -position. <b>Ciclobendazole</b> (methyl 5 -cyclopropylcarbonyl- 2 -benzimidazolecarbamate) is a new broad-spec-trum benzimidazole anthelmintic related to me-bendazole (1) and parbendazole (2).
