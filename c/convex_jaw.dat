50|$|Two {{morphological}} features, present {{already in}} Eodicynodon, made this motion possible. The {{first was a}} double <b>convex</b> <b>jaw</b> joint, wherein both the quadrate and articular formed convex condyles. As the jaw closed, the articular condyle of the lower jaw slid anterio-dorsally along the quadrate condyle, resulting in closure of the mouth from back to front as the posterior end of the mandible was elevated dorsally relative to the anterior end. Forward slide of the lower jaw was limited by the second morphological feature unique to dicynodonts, a pivot point created between the dentary groove and palatal notch upon closure of the jaw. The lower jaw would then move so that the articular condyle slid anterio-ventrally along the quadrate condyle, which would cause the mandible to pivot {{in such a way}} that the front of the mouth closed and the back opened.|$|E
500|$|Most Lipizzans measure between [...] However, horses bred {{that are}} closer to the {{original}} carriage-horse type are taller, approaching [...] Lipizzans have a long head, with a straight or slightly <b>convex</b> profile. The <b>jaw</b> is deep, the ears small, the eyes large and expressive and the nostrils flared. They have a neck that is sturdy, yet arched and withers that are low, muscular and broad. They are a Baroque-type horse, with a wide, deep chest, broad croup and muscular shoulder. The tail is carried high and well set. The legs are well-muscled and strong, with broad joints and well-defined tendons. The feet tend to be small, but are tough.|$|R
