5|$|The first {{turnover}} of Squadron One <b>cutters</b> occurred on 16 May with {{the transfer of}} Point League and Point Garnet to the South Vietnamese Navy under the Vietnamization plan. An elaborate ceremony {{was held at the}} RVN Base in Saigon with dignitaries from many area naval activities witnessing the {{turnover of}} the two <b>cutters.</b> On 5 June, Division 11 was disestablished and its <b>cutters</b> were transferred to Division 13. The need for Squadron One <b>cutters</b> had been supplanted by the shallower draft PCFs and PBRs that were being concentrated in the Delta region for use in Operation Sealords. With better foul weather stationkeeping abilities than the U.S. Navy craft, the Point-class <b>cutters</b> of the Squadron were shifted for use during the northeast monsoon season in the northern half of the country.|$|E
5|$|After Point Grey and Point Orient {{were turned}} over to the RVN on 14 July only Point Cypress and Point Marone were left in Division 13. On that day the {{remaining}} two <b>cutters</b> were given orders to report to the lower Mekong Delta and provide support for operations in the Than Phu Secret Zone. On 19 and 20 July the crews of both <b>cutters</b> consisted of a full complement of 13 RVN sailors and 5 Coast Guardsmen including the commanding officers. Kit Carson Scouts were also embarked, making the decks very crowded. The Scouts were put ashore on a search and destroy mission and the <b>cutters</b> backed them up with gunfire from their decks and the cutter small boats. The raid was successful, netting several captured Viet Cong troops and boxes of documents. A week later both <b>cutters</b> with Australian Army explosive ordnance disposal soldiers aboard cruised the My Thanh River and destroyed fortifications.|$|E

The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including three picket boats, one launch, one pinnace, two <b>cutters,</b> two yawls, and three dinghies.

5|$|The {{squadron}} operated {{divisions in}} three separate areas {{during the period}} of 1965 to 1970. Twenty-six s with their crews and a squadron support staff were assigned to the U.S. Navy with the mission of interdicting the movement of arms and supplies from the South China Sea into South Vietnam by Viet Cong and North Vietnam junk and trawler operators. The squadron also provided naval gunfire support to nearby friendly units operating along the South Vietnamese coastline and assisted the U.S. Navy during Operation Sealords. As the United States' direct involvement in combat operations wound down during 1969, squadron crews began training Republic of Vietnam Navy (RVN) sailors in the operation and deployment of the <b>cutters.</b> The <b>cutters</b> were later turned over to the RVN as part of the Vietnamization of the war effort. Turnover of the <b>cutters</b> to South Vietnamese Navy crews began in May 1969 and was completed by August 1970. Squadron One was disestablished with the decommissioning of the last cutter.|$|E
5|$|With the {{turnover}} of Point Cypress and Point Marone to South Vietnamese navy on 15 August 1970, Squadron One and its remaining division, Division 13, were decommissioned. Over 3,000 Coast Guardsmen had served with Squadron One in Vietnam since May 1965. Administrative and liaison functions {{that had been}} {{carried out by the}} Squadron One staff were turned over to the Office of the Senior Coast Guard Officer, Vietnam (SCGOV). Several officers of Squadron One were assigned temporary duties as advisors to former Squadron One <b>cutters</b> to further assist the new RVN commanding officers in their new duties. The Coast Guard continued to provide technical assistance and training under the SCATTOR/VECTOR programs for the SVN after Squadron One was disestablished through the formation of four Technical Assistance Groups. Each group was composed of an officer and eight to eleven engineers reporting to SCGOV. The groups were located at Da Nang where there were six <b>cutters</b> assigned; Cam Ranh Bay, six cutters; Vung Tau, eight cutters; and An Thoi, six <b>cutters.</b> As tours of duty for each Coast Guardsman ended, U.S. Navy personnel gradually took over the training duties.|$|E

During the lay over at Con Son minor repairs were made and repainting was completed on some of the cutters' hulls which had been partially stripped of paint by the storm. Three RVN liaison officers reported aboard the <b>cutters</b> just before the division departed for Phu Quoc Island and the same three <b>cutters</b> started patrol work {{as the rest of the}} division put into Phu Quoc harbor on 31 July.

5|$|During {{an action}} on 1 March 1968, {{in the early}} morning several Squadron One <b>cutters</b> were {{involved}} in the interdiction and destruction of four North Vietnamese trawlers attempting to smuggle arms and ammunition into South Vietnam at different locations. This co-ordinated attempt by the North Vietnamese was met by various elements of TF115; including U.S. Navy aircraft and vessels, RVN junks, U.S. Air Force aircraft, and U.S. Army helicopters. In addition, there were several Owasco-class cutter <b>cutters</b> from Coast Guard Squadron Three– , , and – as well as Point Grey, Point Hudson, and Point Welcome from Squadron One. As a result of this action, three North Vietnamese trawlers were destroyed and a fourth was turned back before it could reach the coast. After this action the incidence of smuggling by trawler was decreased and Communist forces had to resort to shipments along the Ho Chi Minh trail or through the port of Sihanoukville in Cambodia.|$|E
