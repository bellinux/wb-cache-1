25|$|The {{idea behind}} the {{pinewood}} derby is for the parent, usually the father, but sometimes the mother or grandparent, to spend time helping the child design, carve, paint, add weights, and tune the final car. However, it {{is often the case}} that the parent takes over the construction of the car, an aspect of the event that was lampooned in the 2005 film Down and Derby, and also in a 2009 episode of South Park. The quest for a fast car supports a cottage industry that supplies modified wheels, axles, and blocks as well as videos and instruction books. While a pinewood derby <b>car</b> <b>kit</b> costs around US$4, a set of modified wheels and axles can sell for more than ten times that amount. Each pack sets its own rules under the guidelines set forth by the BSA and their particular local district. The aftermarket items are legal under some Pack rules since the parts originally came from an official Boy Scouts of America (BSA) kit. Complete cars can be purchased on eBay and elsewhere for around $100 to $200, and PineCar, a subsidiary of Woodland Scenics, sells pre-cut or pre-made cars, as well as official kits. Although these cars violate the spirit of the event, if not the rules, enforcement can be difficult.|$|E

As early as 1962, avid British collector Cecil Gibson had even written a book on plastic model cars (Gibson 1962).

50|$|People not {{involved}} in the UK <b>kit</b> <b>car</b> scene may believe all <b>kit</b> <b>cars</b> are given a 'Q' registration plate which signifies a vehicle of unknown or mixed age, where in fact a significant number (majority?) do not. All <b>kit</b> <b>cars</b> are subject to a Vehicle Identity Check, VIC, by the DVLA to determine the registration mark a <b>kit</b> <b>car</b> is assigned. This will be either, a new, current year, registration; an 'age-related' registration; or a 'Q' plate. Once a <b>kit</b> <b>car</b> has been correctly registered, a V5C, or log book, will be assigned and then a <b>kit</b> <b>car</b> is treated {{in exactly the same way}} as a production car, from any larger manufacturer. A <b>kit</b> <b>car</b> must pass its MOT test and have a valid car tax, or have a valid Statutory Off-Road Notification (SORN) declaration. As part of the IVA, a <b>kit</b> <b>car</b> can sometimes be permitted to assume the age of a single, older car (the donor car) if the major parts were taken from it in its construction. If the age identifier assigned to a <b>kit</b> <b>car</b> falls before 1973 the vehicle may be road taxed free of charge.|$|R
