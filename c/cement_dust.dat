It spreads aggressively both by seeds and vegetatively by root sprouts, re-sprouting rapidly after being cut. It is considered a shade-intolerant tree and cannot compete in low-light situations, though it is sometimes found competing with hardwoods, but such competition rather indicates it {{was present at the}} time the stand was established. On the other hand, a study in an old-growth hemlock-hardwood forest in New York found that Ailanthus was capable of competing successfully with native trees in canopy gaps where only 2 to 15% of full sun was available. The same study characterised the tree as using a [...] "gap-obligate" [...] strategy in order to reach the forest canopy, meaning it grows rapidly during a very short period rather than growing slowly over a long period. It is a short lived tree in any location and rarely lives more than 50 years. Ailanthus is among the most pollution-tolerant of tree species, including sulfur dioxide, which it absorbs in its leaves. It can withstand <b>cement</b> <b>dust</b> and fumes from coal tar operations, as well as resist ozone exposure relatively well. Furthermore, high concentrations of mercury have been found built up in tissues of the plant.|$|E

Textile industry {{is one of the most}} water consumers industries of Egypt, thus discharges large amounts of wastewater effluents during processing, especially, in the coloring and washing steps. <b>Cement</b> kiln <b>dust</b> is a solid waste in cement manufacturing. Approximately 2. 5 - 3. 0 (6 - 9 %) million tons of <b>cement</b> kiln <b>dust</b> is produced annually in Egypt and that cause significant environmental problems. Approach: This study aims to investigate removal of some acid dyes from aqueous solution using <b>cement</b> kiln <b>dust</b> and monitoring the dye in colored <b>cement</b> kiln <b>dust.</b> Solution with 0. 4 g L - 1 concentration was treated with <b>cement</b> kiln <b>dust</b> until the color of dye disappears. The colored cement kiln residue was separate by filtration and dried. The concentration of dye was measured before and after treatment by UV-Vis spectroscopy as well as after washing of colored residue. Also, the colored residue was investigated with, XRD, IR and DSC techniques as well as the loss on ignition at 450 °C. Results: The results found that the <b>cement</b> kiln <b>dust</b> has the power to remove all existing acid dyes and the residue has the same color of dye. When colored residue was washed with water, there was no back diffusion of dye in to water. This may be mainly due to chemical reaction that took place between <b>cement</b> kiln <b>dust</b> and dye. Thus analysis such as IR, XRD and DSC are in agreement with these results. Conclusion: CKD is efficient in the processes of dye removal from aqueous solutions. The interaction between acid dye and CKD is fast (just minutes). So, we suggest using spent CKD for dye removal of waste water...|$|R
40|$|Cement {{is widely}} used for {{construction}} and several reports have suggested a potential toxicity of <b>cement</b> <b>dusts</b> although {{it has never been}} definitively assessed. To determine the cytotoxic and bioactive effects of <b>cement</b> <b>dusts,</b> cultures of normal rat fibroblasts were exposed to different types of cements and cell growth parameters, apoptosis and the occurrence of DNA damage (both in terms of DNA breaks and oxidative damage) were analyzed. Cells were exposed to cement extracts or cultured in direct contact with <b>cement</b> <b>dusts</b> and the results obtained were compared to cells cultured in fresh medium. A dose-dependent decrease in viable cells was observed with all tested cements. Different results were obtained in the cell-cement direct contact tests compared to the indirect contact tests performed using extracts. Inhibition of cell growth was associated in most cases with an accumulation of cells in the S-phase of the cell-cycle and the appearance of an apoptotic peak. DNA strand breaks, assessed by comet test, and increase in the levels of 8 -OHdG, an important marker of DNA oxidative damage, always occurred by incubating cells in the presence of <b>cement</b> extracts or <b>dusts.</b> However, after removal of cement, a rapid damage repair was generally observed with an almost complete recovery within 12 hours. In conclusion, all cements analyzed in this study displayed a limited toxicity in vitro without significant differences amongst them. Overall, the results obtained indicate that cements should be treated as hazardous materials but they do not allow to make accurate predictions regarding the in vivo effects. Further studies are warranted to reach {{a better understanding of the}} potential toxic effects of cements, to identify the responsible mechanisms and to evaluate the possibility of modulating and/ or preventing them...|$|R

The design of energy efficient dryers employing heat pump systems and the dynamic response of the product to the kiln conditions must take into account. In this paper, the formulation of a dynamic and kiln-wide drying model is described. The model predictions have been verified by comparing them with the published experimental data. The model is then used to simulate performance of three industrial kilns. Numerical experiments are carried out to investigate influence of key operating and design parameters on energy consumption of kilns. The model is also used to explore the possibility of manipulating temperature profile within the kiln to reduce energy consumption per tonne of clinker. <b>Cement</b> kiln <b>dust</b> is a fine-grained material produced during the manufacture of cement.

Air pollution in coal fire is mainly due to the fugitive {{emission of particulate matter}} and gases including sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). The traditional methods, executed by fire fighting teams by covering the coal fire areas with soil, excavated burning coal outcrops and injecting water in the coal seam fires are continuously improved. Initiatives to introduce modern techniques, such as backfill placement at fracture and coal seam to cool down the burning coal and cut off air supply.

The main thrust of the research is to determine what effect increased levels of limestone mineral addition, when used in conjunction with <b>cement</b> kiln <b>dust,</b> will have on the chloride ion ingress of mortar/concrete. The mortars were manufactured to a constant water/binder ratio and cured under water until crushed. The results indicated that intergrinding the limestone is more effective than post blending the limestone, due to finer grinding and formation of nucleation points. The addition of up to 5 % <b>cement</b> kiln <b>dust</b> did not adversely affect the compressive strength of cement only mixes. In mixes made with 20 % and 30 % fly ash replacement of cement, the use of limestone mineral addition and/or <b>cement</b> kiln <b>dust</b> appeared to improve the activation of the fly ash, as compressive strengths were all greater than the control mix at 28 -days, with the total binder level and water/binder ratio being equal in all mixes.

Extruded coelomocytes were exposed 18 h in vitro to 10, 100, and 500 mg L- 1 of <b>cement</b> kiln <b>dust</b> particles. The phagocytosis and the cell viability were determined using a double-laser-flow acquisition cytometry system.

The PSOE members on the Board voted against the projects, while the PP Mayor and his City Council representative on the Board abstained after calling on the PortAuthority to modify all the projects to lower the height of the buildings to within the 12 m maximum set out by the Special Plan for the Port. The Mayor also called on the Port Authority to seek an immediate solution to the clouds of dust occasioned by the open air unloading of cement in the port. The Administrative Board, however, passed by a majority the motion to pass the projects without modification to the City Councils Planning Department to decide whether construction licences should be granted for such projects so close to the city centre and to be built right in the centre of the city’s coastal strip. The vote of the Administration Board of the Port Authority, taken without responding first to any of the thousands of citizens’ objections, has increased and European environmentalists’ indignation.On 4 November 2007, the President of the Port Authority, Sergio Campos, gave an interview in the national press about the various problems and the local opposition encountered in relation to the new plans for Alicante port. He indicated that the biodiesel chemical plant may have to be located elsewhere (given that the City Council rejected the application for its construction licence because its 20-metre planned height exceeds the 12 m general limit for the port and {{due to the lack of}} studies and licences for the distribution by road of the end product). Campos also admitted that “the port’s concern for the environment is grows stronger day by day” in light of the pressure from the residents, the city, and local and national government, and recognised that “Alicante is a commercial port not an industrial port” but he insisted again that the mega-silos are necessary since they are a “relocation” of the 3 silos 8 m high in Quay 14. He also recognised publicly, for the first time, that at present “clinker <b>cement</b> <b>dust</b> and carbon are moved by grain and bulldozer, and that if there is a strong wind it is true that clouds of dust are produced”. He admitted that the measures set out in the 2003 environmental permission for the port (use of chutes, screens, closed conveyor belts, watering systems, taking measures to prohibit unloading on days of high wind, measuring dust particles in the air during unloading) had not been taken but he stated his “desire” to implement them in the future. He made it clear that these open-air activities are planned not only to continue but to grow in future, and that they are not being substituted by the plans for the mega-silos and <b>cement</b> <b>dust</b> plants.On 6 November 2007, the editorial of a local newspaper summed up the situation by stating that “What is clear is that once built, these silos for the storage of cement will substantially change the appearance of the city of Alicante, above all when viewed from the sea or from the coastal roads, and the projects will eclipse the Castle of Santa Barbara and the “Cara del Moro”, the historical symbols of Alicante city, relegating them to a secondary position”.|$|E

In regard to the siting of projects for the creation of industrial zones, Annex III stipulates that the environmental sensitiveness of the geographical areas that might be affected by the projects shall be taken into account, in particular, the current use of the zone, with special attention to be paid to: coastal areas (as in the case of the Port of Alicante), nature reserves and parks (as in the case of the nearby Site of Community Interest, the Island of Tabarca, recognised by the European Commission) for its enormous environmental importance, areas of great democratic density (like the residential neighbourhoods of Alicante right next to the zone) and zones of historical and cultural interest (such as the coastal landscape of Alicante). This beautiful coastal landscape is also protected by the European Landscape Convention 2000, Spanish Law 4/2004 of the Autonomous Region of the Communidad of Valencia and European Directive 92/43/EEC.Alicante Port Authority’s President has replied that the construction of the <b>cement</b> <b>dust</b> mega-silos was decided in 1992, although this was not mentioned in the previous President’s declarations to the press in December 2006. The new President, Campos, has stated that the number of new silos is negotiable but insists that a minimum height of 12 m for the various mega-silos is technically necessary merely for the trucks to be able to drive underneath for the vertical loading of the <b>cement</b> <b>dust.</b> On top of this height, he has stated, sit the silos themselves (currently 8 m high on Quay 14 of Alicante Port). Against what the Port says is this “technically necessary height” of a total of 20 m, the residents say that the silos need only be raised some 4 or 5 m from the ground in order to vertically unload into trucks, and adding the 8 m high silos above this would give a total of some 12 m, within the general height restrictions of the Port, and would allow the re-siting of the four silos on Quay 14 with the minimum visual and environmental (including noise, <b>cement</b> <b>dust</b> and traffic) impact.|$|E

With increased environmental awareness concerning potential hazardous effects, the recycling or utilization of industrial waste by-products have become an attractive alternative to disposal. Several studies have been reported on the utilization of waste materials and by-products such as waste foundry sand (WFS), coal bottom ash (CBA), <b>cement</b> kiln <b>dust</b> (CKD) and wood ash (WA) in making cement-concrete and controlled low-strength material (CLSM). This paper presents {{an overview of the}} work published on physical, chemical, and mineralogical composition, mechanical properties such as workability, setting times, compressive, splitting and flexural strength, permeability etc. of concrete and CLSM made with waste foundry sand, coal bottom ash, <b>cement</b> kiln <b>dust</b> and wood ash...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cement</b> by-pass <b>dust</b> (CBPD) or <b>cement</b> kiln <b>dust</b> (CKD) is a {{by-product}} of the manufacture of Portland cement. It is generated during the calcining process in the kiln. Lime (CaO) constitutes more than 60 % of CBPD composition. Other compounds include Si 02, AlzOs, FezOa, KzO, Na 20, Cl', etc. Oman Cement Company generates about 25, 000 to 30, 000 tons of CBPD every year. Some CBPD {{is used as a}} filler for road asphalting. The remainder of the CBPD is disposed of on-site without any further reuse or reclamation. As such, research was carried out to investigate beneficial reuses of CBPD in the Sultanate of Oman. This paper presents the results of a study that investigated the use of CBPD in the stabilization of an expansive clay. The soil was stabilized with 0, 3, 6, and 9 % CBPD. Mixtures were subjected to the following tests: (1) Atterberg limits, (2) pH, (3) compaction, (4) California Bearing Ratio (CBR), (5) swell percent, and (6) swell pressure. Results indicate that as <b>cement</b> by-pass <b>dust</b> content increases, the swell percent and maximum dry density decrease while the pH and CBR values tend to increase. Thus, CBPD could potentially act similar to lime or cement in improving the properties of clayey or silty soils...|$|R
