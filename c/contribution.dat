5000|$|Superannuation <b>contributions</b> {{are either}} {{concessional}} or non-concessional <b>contributions.</b> Concessional <b>contributions</b> (sometimes {{referred to as}} [...] "before-tax" [...] <b>contributions)</b> are <b>contributions</b> for which someone (such as an employer) has received a tax deduction. Concessional <b>contributions</b> include superannuation guarantee (SG) <b>contributions,</b> salary sacrifice <b>contributions,</b> other employer <b>contributions</b> and <b>contributions</b> claimed as a personal tax deduction. Concessional <b>contributions</b> are taxed in the fund.

The model is a dynamic system of conditional compound Poisson processes {{in which there are}} <b>contributions</b> from both individuals and political action committees (PACs).

Under these assumptions, I find that employer <b>contributions</b> have a stronger (negative) effect on employment than employee <b>contributions.</b> Furthermore, a change in how <b>contributions</b> are divided that reduces the share of employers is beneficial for employment.
