5|$|The Earl of Oxford, {{commanding}} {{the right wing}} of the Neville army, broke the opposing Yorkist line, under William, Lord Hastings, early in the battle. Oxford's men proceeded to chase the fleeing soldiers, and ended up looting away from the battlefield. Oxford managed to regroup his men, but, returning to the battlefield, as James Ross has put it, 'disaster struck.' In the time he and his force had been absent, the line of battle had shifted almost ninety degrees, so instead of returning to attack Edward's rear, he crashed into Montagu's section. The fog prevented identification, and Oxford's men fought with Montagu's. Montagu may, one chronicler suggests, have mistakenly seen Oxford's 'Streaming star' banner as the king's 'Sunne in splendour,' and thus believe that the Earl had gone over to York. Recently though, one historian has pointed out that, in fact, Oxford had never previously used such a <b>cognizance,</b> and it was more prosaically just a case of men confused by fog.|$|E

25|$|The Programme {{generated}} criticism when it {{was learned}} that inadequate planning may threaten to halt the entire programme. Furthermore, there have been allegations of conflict of interest by certain persons who, although occupying highest government offices, had formed private companies to win the installation contract from the Government.

25|$|Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the 19th-century Indian {{religious}} leader {{and founder of}} the Ahmadiyya movement in Islam, is known to have made many prophecies during his lifetime. Some were of an intuitive nature, pertaining to everyday affairs which are said to have either been fulfilled immediately after having been foreseen or concerned distant or unseen events of which Ghulam Ahmad expressed <b>cognizance.</b> Some of greater significance are believed to have been fulfilled during his lifetime; some, according to his followers, were fulfilled after his death, while some await fulfilment. Others, according to his critics, seemed to have been proven wrong.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1609 {{rumors of}} an {{impending}} rebellion of Negroes circulated. Velasco took preventative measures, including sending an armed force under Captain Pedro González de Herrera to Puebla. Herrera was {{to combat the}} escaped slaves and rebels (Maroons) on the Rio Blanco, who preyed on travelers between Veracruz and Mexico City. The leader of the blacks, Gaspar Yanga, {{sent a letter to}} Captain Herrera. The letter outlined the mistreatment of the blacks that had led them to flee captivity. Velasco took <b>cognizance</b> of the letter, but not before a bloody battle was fought, with heavy losses on each side. Velasco then arranged for the escaped slaves to found their own village, San Lorenzo de los Negros, near Córdova.|$|E
25|$|Any {{suggestion}} of further reading on Kant {{has to take}} <b>cognizance</b> {{of the fact that}} his work has dominated philosophy like no other figure after him. Nevertheless, several guideposts can be made out. In Germany, one important contemporary interpreter of Kant and the movement of German Idealism he began is Dieter Henrich, who has some work available in English. P. F. Strawson's The Bounds of Sense (1966) {{played a significant role in}} determining the contemporary reception of Kant in England and America. More recent interpreters of note in the English-speaking world include Lewis White Beck, Jonathan Bennett, Henry Allison, Paul Guyer, Christine Korsgaard, Stephen Palmquist, Robert B. Pippin, Roger Scruton, Rudolf Makkreel, and Béatrice Longuenesse.|$|E
25|$|Heraldic badges are {{distinctive}} to {{a person}} or family, similar to the arms and the crest. But unlike them, the badge is not an integral component of a coat of arms, although they can be displayed alongside them. Badges are in fact complete and independent and can be displayed alone. Furthermore, unlike the arms and crest, which are personal devices {{that could only be}} displayed by the owner, the badge could be easily borne by others, {{in the form of a}} <b>cognizance</b> or livery badge, to be worn by retainers and adherents. Badges are displayed on standards and personal objects, as well as on private and public buildings to show ownership or patronage.|$|E
25|$|Provided is {{an excerpt}} from Mansions and Manors of Herefordshire {{describing}} his home, and burial in the church of Bodenham Devereux: The manor-house, formerly called “Devereux Court” and now the “Moat,” is situated near the Church, and is a timber mansion of great antiquity. It probably formed the residence of Sir Walter Devereux who was the Sheriff, 50 and 51 Edward III, and whose monument was {{to be seen in}} the church forty years ago. Dingley (Hist. from Marble. Part I, ccxxxvi.) gives a sketch of it, from which we gather that it represented a knight in chain-armour with a sleeveless surcoat over the hawberk. The sword is on the right side and attached to a jeweled belt. The hands are crossed above the breast, on which are depicted the arms of Devereux. These are repeated at intervals on the upper plinth, where a French inscription is partially legible. Sir Walter obtained licence for a market and fair at his manor of Bodenham, and probably contributed largely to the re-building of the church, in the windows of which were to be seen the arms of Devereux and the <b>cognizance</b> of Richard II – the white hart lodged – together with the arms of that monarch and those of Delabere, Lucy, and Brydges. All these memorials have now perished; the alabaster slab, on which the effigy of Sir Walter was incised, was broken into fragments at the restoration of the church in 1834.|$|E
500|$|In the Brihat-Samhita, Varahamihira {{says that}} [...] "Mothers {{are to be}} made with <b>cognizance</b> of (different major Hindu) gods {{corresponding}} to their names." [...] They are associated with these gods as their spouses or their energies (Shaktis). Originally {{believed to be a}} personification of the seven stars of the star cluster the Pleiades, they became quite popular by the seventh century and a standard feature of goddess temples from the ninth century onwards.|$|E

[...] "In following up on the compliance requirements for airports developed or improved with Federal funds, the FAA did not take adequate measures, in accordance with existing statues, to assure that the hazard was removed from the vicinity of the airport." [...] The NTSB was reportedly [...] "concerned because responsible authorities had not taken due <b>cognizance</b> of the bird hazards to aircraft at the DeKalb–Peachtree Airport." [...] The final report stated, ...|$|E
500|$|The first dent in this {{stability}} {{came about}} in 1607, with the Case of Prohibitions. James VI and I claimed that as monarch, {{he had a}} divine right to sit as a judge and interpret the common law as he saw fit. Led by Sir Edward Coke, the judiciary rejected this idea, stating that while the monarch was not subject to any individual, he was subject to the law. Until he had gained sufficient knowledge of the law, he {{had no right to}} interpret it; Coke pointed out that such knowledge [...] "demanded mastery of an artificial reason... which requires long study and experience, before that a man can attain to the <b>cognizance</b> of it". Similarly, in the Case of Proclamations in 1611, Coke held that the monarch could only exercise those prerogatives he already had, and not create new ones.|$|E
500|$|The {{legislative}} {{history of the}} Judiciary Act of 1789 reveals little consideration of criminal appeals. Caleb Strong, a Senator {{at the time of}} its drafting, described §22 of that act as follows: [...] "Writs of Error from the Circuit to the Supr. Court in all Causes not criminal of which the Circuit Court has original <b>Cognizance</b> and the Matter in Dispute does not exceed 2000 Dolrs." [...] Senator (and future Supreme Court justice) William Paterson noticed the lack of provision for criminal appeals in preliminary notes and a draft outline of a speech he gave on June 23, 1789. According to Rossman, Paterson may have viewed the inability of the government to appeal (to a court in the nation's capitol) as a [...] "protection for ordinary citizens." [...] The issue of criminal appeals was not mentioned in the House debates.|$|E
500|$|Section 8 {{provided}} that [...] "the trial of crimes committed {{on the high}} seas, or in any place out of the jurisdiction of any particular State, shall be in the district where the offender is apprehended, or into which he may first be brought." [...] Thus, section 8 was an exercise of Congress's authority under Article Three to define criminal venue for all crimes [...] "not committed within any State." [...] But, the Supreme Court did not interpret section 8 as exercising {{the full extent of}} Congress's authority under Article Three. In Ex parte Bollman (1807), the Court held that the statutory term [...] "any place out of the jurisdiction of any particular state" [...] applied only to [...] "any river, haven, bason or bay, not within the jurisdiction of any particular state," [...] and only in [...] "those cases there is no court which has particular <b>cognizance</b> of the crime." ...|$|E
500|$|As society matures, the Singapore Government {{has taken}} greater <b>cognizance</b> of educated and {{informed}} Singaporeans who place greater value on their rights {{of expression and}} call for a less restrictive culture. In 2004, Lee Hsien Loong, then Deputy Prime Minister, expressed how the Government would be [...] "increasingly guided by the consensus of views in the community with regards to morality and decency issues" [...] {{in a bid to}} [...] "pull back from being all things to all citizens". However, he emphasized the caveat of [...] "opening up more choices for citizens, without imposing on the whole of society". Civic participation may be engaged through debates on policies and national issues, but criticism which [...] "scores political points and undermines the government's standing, {{whether or not this is}} intended" [...] will not be treated lightly. When the opposition criticizes an action or policy, the Government [...] "necessarily has to rebut or even demolish them, so not to lose its moral authority".|$|E
500|$|This {{middle ground}} {{approach}} was discussed in ex parte Page when their Lordships dealt with whether the court can intervene and review {{a decision made}} by a visitor (overseer) of a university. Lord Browne-Wilkinson {{found that there were}} two reasons why the general rule that all errors of law are reviewable does not apply to visitors. First, the reason why courts can intervene in a normal case where the decision is considered ultra vires is because the law applicable to a decision made by such a body is the general law of the land. The visitor in ex parte Page did not apply the general law of the land but, rather, a [...] "domestic law" [...] (the university's charter and statutes) of which he was the sole arbiter and over which the courts had no <b>cognizance.</b> Therefore, the visitor [...] "cannot err in law in reaching [...] decision since the general law is not the applicable law".|$|E
500|$|Around 15 June Darwin and FitzRoy {{visited the}} noted {{astronomer}} Sir John Herschel. In his diary Darwin called this [...] "the most memorable event which, {{for a long}} period, I have {{had the good fortune}} to enjoy." [...] His zeal for science had been stirred at Cambridge by reading Herschel's book on philosophy of science, which had guided his theorising during the voyage. Their discussion is not recorded, but a few months earlier, on 20 February 1836, Herschel had written to Lyell praising his Principles of Geology as a work which would bring [...] "a complete revolution in [...] subject, by altering entirely the point of view in which it must thenceforward be contemplated." [...] and opening a way for bold speculation on [...] "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others." [...] Herschel himself thought catastrophic extinction and renewal [...] "an inadequate conception of the Creator", and by analogy with other intermediate causes [...] "the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our <b>cognizance,</b> would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".|$|E
500|$|But, Bollman {{held that}} venue for the Neutrality Act charges was {{improper}} in the District of Columbia. First, the Court rejected locus delicti venue (without reaching {{the question of}} whether such could exist outside of a U.S. state). [...] "hat no part of this crime was committed in the district of Columbia is apparent. It is therefore the unanimous opinion of the court that they cannot be tried in this district." [...] Second, the Court rejected statutory venue under section 8 the Crimes Act of 1790 (as permitted by Article Three for crimes not committed within a state). The Court held that the Territory of Orleans was not a place that triggered the alternative venue provisions of the Crimes Act. The Court held that the statutory term [...] "any place out of the jurisdiction of any particular state" [...] applied only to [...] "any river, haven, bason or bay, not within the jurisdiction of any particular state," [...] and only in [...] "those cases there is no court which has particular <b>cognizance</b> of the crime." ...|$|E
500|$|Cranch {{held that}} More was an Article III judge {{sitting on a}} [...] "Tribunal {{inferior}} to the supreme Court." [...] In response to the argument that his jurisdiction exceeded Article Three, Cranch replied that: [...] "The causes of which they have <b>cognizance,</b> are causes arising under {{the laws of the}} United States, and, therefore, the power of trying them, is part of the judicial power [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] In response to the argument that the fees would never have been paid at a [...] "time Stated," [...] Cranch replied that: [...] "t may, perhaps, be a compliance with the clause of the constitution, which requires that it shall be receivable at stated times, to say that it shall be paid when the service is rendered. And, we are rather to incline to this construction, than to suppose the command of the constitution to have been disobeyed." [...] Further, Cranch dodged the question of whether a five-year term was consistent with the Good Behavior Clause. [...] "It is unnecessary in this cause to decide the question, whether, as such, he holds his office during good behaviour [...] [...] [...] [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Academic Leona W. Fisher {{wrote in}} Children's Literature Association Quarterly {{that the novel}} employs a seldom used yet ingenious {{literary}} technique: {{the story is told}} with [...] "the sustained internal monologue presented almost exclusively in the present tense". The mores of his society and the actions of adults are strained through Marty's mind concurrently with his emotional agony and ethical judgments. The dialogue of the other characters tempers but does not counteract the [...] "exclusivity of his linguistic point of view" [...] because Marty is the sole narrator. Shiloh has a [...] "compacted time-frame, bounded by the past-tense opening and closing". Fisher noted that because the novel's events are confined to several weeks in the summer, {{there is no need for}} a [...] "panoramic sweep" [...] of the actions. The reader can concentrate solely on Marty's ethical crisis. Conveying the mood of the novel is also mostly confined to Marty's thoughts and current action. Naylor uses the past-perfect verb [...] "had" [...] on several occasions to depict the tones of the scenes. This usage conveys turning-points in the story, transferring the reader from the [...] "immediate tension" [...] of the present to a growing <b>cognizance.</b>|$|E
500|$|... he {{jurisdiction}} of the Court of King's Bench, for example, was originally confined to pleas of the Crown, and then extended to actions where violence was used – actions of trespass, by force; but now, all actions are admissible within its walls, {{through the medium of}} a legal fiction, which was adopted for the purpose of enlarging its authority, that every person sued is in the custody of the marshal of the court and may, therefore, be proceeded against for any personal cause of actions. Thus, by degrees, this court has drawn over to itself actions which really belong to...the Court of Common Pleas. The Court of Common Pleas, however...never was able to obtain <b>cognizance</b> of – the peculiar subject of King's Bench jurisdiction – Crown Pleas... the Exchequer has adopted a similar course for, though it was originally confined to the trial of revenue cases, it has, by means of another fiction – the supposition that everybody sued is a debtor to the Crown, and further, that he cannot pay his debt, because the other party will not pay him, – opened its doors to every suitor, and so drawn to itself the right of trying cases, that were never intended to be placed within its jurisdiction.|$|E
500|$|Due to a {{misunderstanding}} by Sir Edward Coke in his Institutes of the Lawes of England, academics {{thought for a}} long time that the King's Bench was primarily a criminal court. This was factually incorrect; no indictment was tried by the King's Bench until January 1323, and no record of the court ordering the death penalty is found until halfway through Edward II's reign. The court did have some criminal jurisdiction, with a royal ordinance in 1293 directing conspiracy cases to be brought to the King's Bench and the court's judges acting in trailbaston commissions around the country. A.T. Carter, in his History of English Legal Institutions, defines the early King's Bench jurisdiction as [...] "to correct all crimes and misdemeanours that amounted to a breach of the peace, the King being then plaintiff, for such were in derogation of the Jura regalia; and to take <b>cognizance</b> of everything not parcelled out to the other courts". By the end of the 14th century much of the criminal jurisdiction had declined, although the court maintained a criminal jurisdiction over all cases in Middlesex, the county where Westminster Hall stood. The King's Bench's main jurisdiction was over [...] "pleas of the crown"; cases which involved the King in some way. With the exception of revenue matters, which were handled by the Exchequer of Pleas, the King's Bench held exclusive jurisdiction over these cases.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the victory}} at Wakefield, Clifford and other Lancastrian lords {{in the north}} {{attended}} Queen Margaret's Royal council in January; they soon led their army south. Gregory's Chronicle reports that everyone wore the Prince of Wales' <b>cognizance,</b> the ostrich feather badge. [...] On 17 February 1461 they encountered a Yorkist army, led by Warwick and his brother John Neville, at St Albans. This resulted in another resounding victory for the Lancastrians, and Henry VI was captured from Warwick {{and returned to his}} wife and son. It is possible that this reunion occurred in John Clifford's own tent after the battle. Instead of marching on London however, the royal army retreated to the north, Clifford with it, and a Yorkist force slowly trailing them from London. On 28 March 1461 portions of the two armies clashed whilst attempting to cross the River Aire at Ferrybridge. The Lancastrian force, under Clifford, captured the bridge, but the Yorkists had forded the river upstream and flank-attacked Clifford's men. Traditionally, Clifford was killed at Dittingdale, possibly by a headless arrow in the throat, and buried in a common burial pit, {{along with the rest of}} the dead from that encounter. Despite being only a few miles away, the main Lancastrian army held its position and either did not or could not come to his aid.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} the King's own {{position}} {{in relation to the}} law, and his authority to decide this matter, was brought up, in {{what became known as the}} Case of Prohibitions. James stated that [...] "In cases where there is not express authority in law, the King may himself decide in his royal person; the Judges are but delegates of the King". Coke challenged this, saying [...] "the King in his own person cannot adjudge any case, either criminal - as treason, felony etc, or betwixt party and party; but this ought to be determined and adjudged in some court of justice, according to the Law and Custom of England". Coke further stated that [...] "The common law protecteth the King", to which James replied [...] "The King protecteth the law, and not the law the King! The King maketh judges and bishops. If the judges interpret the laws themselves and suffer none else to interpret, they may easily make, of the laws, shipmen's hose!". Coke rejected this, stating that while the monarch was not subject to any individual, he was subject to the law. Until he had gained sufficient knowledge of the law, he had no right to interpret it; he pointed out that such knowledge [...] "demanded mastery of an artificial reason... which requires long study and experience, before that a man can attain to the <b>cognizance</b> of it". Victorious, Coke freely left, and continued to issue writs of prohibition against the High Commission.|$|E
