5000|$|All {{regulated}} {{financial institutions}} in the United States are required to file periodic financial and other information with their respective regulators and other parties. For banks in the U.S., {{one of the key}} reports required to be filed is the quarterly Consolidated Report of Condition and Income, generally referred to as the <b>call</b> <b>report</b> or RC report. Specifically, every National Bank, State Member Bank and insured Nonmember Bank is required by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) to file a <b>call</b> <b>report</b> as of the close of business {{on the last day of}} each calendar quarter, i.e. the report date. The specific reporting requirements depend upon the size of the bank and whether or not it has any foreign offices. [...] Call reports are due no later than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. Revisions may be made without prejudice up to 30 days after the initial filing period. Form FFIEC 031 is used for banks with both domestic (U.S.) and foreign (non-U.S.) offices; Form FFIEC 041 is for banks with domestic (U.S.) offices only.|$|E
50|$|The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is {{responsible}} for overseeing insured financial institution adherence to FFIEC reporting requirements, including the observance of all bank regulatory agency rules and regulations, accounting principles and pronouncements adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and all other matters relating to a <b>call</b> <b>report</b> submission. Call reports are required by statute and collected by the FDIC under the provision of Section 1817(a)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.|$|E
40|$|Medical {{errors and}} close calls are {{pervasive}} in health care. It is {{hypothesized that the}} causes of close calls {{are the same as}} for medical errors; therefore learning about close calls can help prevent errors and increase patient safety. Yet despite efforts to encourage close <b>call</b> <b>reporting,</b> close <b>calls</b> as well as medical errors are under-reported in health care. The purpose of this dissertation was to implement and evaluate a web-based anonymous close <b>call</b> <b>reporting</b> system in three units at an urban hospital. ^ The study participants were physicians, nurses and medical technicians (N = 187) who care for patients in the Medical Intermediate Care Unit, the Surgical Intermediate Care Unit, and the Coronary Catheterization Laboratory in the hospital. We provided educational information to the participants on how to use the system and e-mailed and delivered paper reminders to report to the participants throughout the 19 -month project. We surveyed the participants at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the study to assess their attitudes and beliefs regarding incident reporting. We found that the majority of the health care providers in our study are supportive of incident reporting in general but in practice very few had actually reported an error or a close call, semi-structured interview 20 weeks after we made the close <b>call</b> <b>reporting</b> system available. The purpose of the interviews was to further assess the participants 2 ̆ 7 attitudes regarding incident reporting and the reporting system. Our findings suggest that the health care providers are supportive of medical error reporting in general, but are not convinced of the benefit of <b>reporting</b> close <b>calls.</b> Barriers to close <b>call</b> <b>reporting</b> cited include lack of time, heavy workloads, preferring to take care of close calls 2 ̆ 2 on the spot 2 ̆ 2, and not seeing the benefits of close <b>call</b> <b>reporting.</b> Consequently only two = close <b>calls</b> were <b>reported</b> via the system by two separate caregivers during the project. ^ The findings suggest that future efforts to increase close <b>call</b> <b>reporting</b> must address barriers to reporting, especially the belief among care givers that it is not worth taking time from their already busy schedules to <b>report</b> close <b>calls.</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|All {{regulated}} {{financial institutions}} in the United States are required to file periodic financial and other information with their respective regulators and other parties. Thrifts are required by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), among other requirements, to file a key quarterly financial report called the Thrift Financial Report (TFR) to be filed electronically with the OTS. In 2007, {{there had been a}} proposal that thrifts convert to filing a similar report, the Report of Condition and Income commonly referred to as the <b>Call</b> <b>Report,</b> which banks prepare and file with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. [...] Since thrifts continue to file TFRs today, the proposal was dismissed or set aside for the time being.|$|E
50|$|The FDIC collects, corrects, updates {{and stores}} <b>call</b> <b>report</b> data {{submitted}} by all insured {{national and state}} nonmember commercial banks and state-chartered savings banks on a quarterly basis. Call reports data are a widely used source of timely and accurate financial data regarding a bank's financial condition {{and the results of}} its operations. The information is extensively used by the bank regulatory agencies in their daily offsite bank monitoring activities. call reports data are also used by the public, the Congress of the United States, state banking authorities, researchers, bank rating agencies and the academic community. The FDIC is fully responsible for maintaining an accurate and up-to-date call reports data base readily available to all users. call reports data are a critical publicly available source of information regarding the status of U.S. banking system.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{depository}} {{institutions are}} subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). These guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy based primarily on the perceived credit risk associated with balance sheet assets, as well as certain off-balance sheet exposures such as unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit, and derivatives and foreign exchange contracts. The risk-based capital guidelines are supplemented by a leverage ratio requirement. To be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4%, a combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital ratio of at least 8%, and a leverage ratio of at least 4%, and {{not be subject to}} a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. To be well-capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital ratio of at least 10%, and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. These capital ratios are reported quarterly on the <b>Call</b> <b>Report</b> or Thrift Financial Report. Although Tier 1 capital has traditionally been emphasized, in the Late-2000s recession regulators and investors began to focus on tangible common equity, which is different from Tier 1 capital in that it excludes preferred equity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Each quarter, banks file a <b>call</b> <b>report,</b> or Report of Condition and Income, {{containing}} {{hundreds of}} accounting items pertaining to their financial condition. Because call reports are filed quarterly, whereas banks are typically examined about once every twelve to eighteen months, statistical early warning models using <b>call</b> <b>report</b> data potentially {{provide a more}} up-todate picture of a bank’s condition than on-site exams alone. Often neglected, however, {{is the fact that}} <b>call</b> <b>report</b> data are subject to revision. We find evidence of a strong relationship between on-site exams and <b>call</b> <b>report</b> revisions. In addition, we evaluate a major class of early warning models using both originally published and revised data to assess whether model accuracy in real time is appreciably lower than accuracy measured using revised data. The findings indicate revised data overstate the accuracy of early warning models. The substantial effect of revisions on the accuracy of early warning models, coupled with the finding of a relationship between revisions and exams, points to a substantial auditing role for on-site exams. More generally, our findings point to the need for care in the use of <b>call</b> <b>report</b> data for research in which the real-time flow of financial information is of some concern...|$|E
