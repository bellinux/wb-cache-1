Equations which define the shape of the curve and the tension of the chain at each point may be derived by a careful inspection of the various forces acting on a segment using the fact that these forces must be in balance if the chain is in static equilibrium.|$|R
5000|$|A patch <b>cable</b> or patch <b>cord</b> or patch lead is an {{electrical}} or optical cable used to connect ("patch in") one electronic or optical device to another for signal routing. Devices {{of different types}} (e.g., a switch connected to a computer, or a switch to a router) are connected with patch cords. Patch cords are usually produced in many different colors {{so as to be}} easily distinguishable, and are relatively short, perhaps no longer than two metres. Types of patch <b>cords</b> include microphone <b>cables,</b> headphone extension cables, XLR connector, Tiny Telephone (TT) connector, RCA connector and ¼" [...] TRS phone connector cables (as well as modular Ethernet cables), and thicker, hose-like <b>cords</b> (snake <b>cable)</b> used to carry video or amplified signals.

40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems, the fire ignition can be originated by incident energy of faults. Faults involve overheating, arcing and burning {{for all the}} wiring exposed to mechanical damage and other insulation stresses especially wiring connected by flexible <b>cords</b> and <b>cables.</b> The mechanical damage of the stranded bare conductors can degrade the effective sizing of the total cross section, causing anomalous conditions of local overcurrent. To highlight the local incident energy in case of fault, the parameters steady current and transient current densities can assist in analyzing the event. The conductors size reduction, degrading locally the thermal withstand capability, makes ineffective the protection coordination amplifying the anomalous effect of current no detectable adequately by overcurrent protective devices. The faulted cords remain so energized and present electric shock and fire hazards. Generally and especially in strategic buildings as hospitals, preventing ignition is better than promptly extinguishing. An efficient protection {{can be achieved by}} integration of active and passive techniques : - by adoption of the special device Arc-fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI) that recognize the arcing; - by wiring the circuits, particularly extension <b>cords,</b> with Ground-Fault-Forced <b>Cables,</b> GFFCs, that convert faults into ground faults easily protected by ground fault protective devices (GFPDs) ...|$|R
