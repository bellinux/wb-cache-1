500|$|In {{the late}} 80s, several {{researchers}} advocated {{a completely new}} approach to artificial intelligence, based on robotics. They believed that, to show real intelligence, a machine {{needs to have a}} body — it needs to perceive, move, survive and deal with the world. They argued that these sensorimotor skills are essential to higher level skills like <b>commonsense</b> <b>reasoning</b> and that abstract reasoning was actually the least interesting or important human skill (see Moravec's paradox). They advocated building intelligence [...] "from the bottom up." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001, AI founder Marvin Minsky asked [...] "So the {{question}} is why didn't we get HAL in 2001?" [...] Minsky believed that the answer is that the central problems, like <b>commonsense</b> <b>reasoning,</b> were being neglected, while most researchers pursued things like commercial applications of neural nets or genetic algorithms. John McCarthy, on the other hand, still blamed the qualification problem. For Ray Kurzweil, the issue is computer power and, using Moore's Law, he predicted that machines with human-level intelligence will appear by 2029. Jeff Hawkins argued that neural net research ignores the essential properties of the human cortex, preferring simple models that have been successful at solving simple problems. There were many other explanations and for each there was a corresponding research program underway.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model for <b>commonsense</b> causal <b>reasoning,</b> based on the basic idea of neural networks. After an {{analysis}} of the advantages and limitations of existing accounts of causality, a fuzzy logic based formalism FEL is proposed that takes into account the inexactness and the cumulative evidentiality of <b>commonsense</b> causal <b>reasoning,</b> overcoming the limitations of existing accounts. Analyses concerning how FEL handles various aspects of <b>commonsense</b> causal <b>reasoning</b> are performed, in an abstract way. FEL can be implemented (naturally) in a neural (connectionist) network.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of performing automated reasoning in probabilistic logic when probabilities are expressed by means of linguistic quantifiers. Each linguistic term is expressed as a prescribed interval of proportions. Then instead of propagating numbers, qualitative terms are propagated {{in accordance with the}} numerical interpretation of these terms. The quantified syllogism, modelling the chaining of probabilistic rules, is studied in this context. It is shown that a qualitative counterpart of this syllogism makes sense, and is relatively independent of the threshold defining the linguistically meaningful intervals, provided that these threshold values remain in accordance with the intuition. The inference power is less than that of a full-fledged probabilistic con-quaint propagation device but better corresponds to what could be thought of as <b>commonsense</b> probabilistic <b>reasoning.</b> Comment: Appears in Proceedings of the Eighth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 1992...|$|R
40|$|<b>Commonsense</b> causal <b>reasoning</b> {{occupies}} a central position in human reasoning. It plays {{an essential role}} in both informal and formal human decision-making. Causality itself as well as human understanding of causality is imprecise, sometimes necessarily so. Our common sense understanding of the world tells us that {{we have to deal with}} imprecision, uncertainty and imperfect knowledge. A difficulty is striking a good balance between precise formalism and commonsense imprecise reality. Clearly, an algorithmic method of handling imprecision is needed. Today, data mining holds the promise of extracting unsuspected information from very large databases. In many ways, the interest is the promise (or illusion) of causal, or at least, predictive relationships. However, the most common data mining rule forms only calculate a joint occurrence frequency; they do not express a causal relationship. Without understanding the underlying causality, a naïve use of data mining rules can lead to undesirable actions. 1...|$|R
