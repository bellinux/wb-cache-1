At the beginning, flexural rigidity values (EI) of <b>crop</b> <b>stalks</b> were calculated from the results of de flection test using image processing apparatus. Further, deflection values and posture of <b>crop</b> <b>stalks</b> were predicted by analysis of Finite Element Method (FEM) using parameters of EI. Therefore, propriety of FEM analysis was examined through the comparison with measured values. Finally, in this study, the following results were obtained: 1) The deflection of <b>crop</b> <b>stalks</b> could be returned to initial condition in a moment against a light load. But, against a heavy load, it took a little time to return to initial condition. Namely, the <b>crop</b> <b>stalks</b> were indicated to have {{characteristics of}} viscous elasticity. 2) Deflection values and posture of <b>crop</b> <b>stalks</b> calculated by FEM analysis almost coincided with measured values.

The cause of these adverse effects {{is linked to}} the disproportionate contribution of impurities from the trash component of the crop. This paper reports on the zeta (?) potential, average size distribution (d 50) and fractal dimension (Df) of limed juice particles derived from various juice types using laser diffraction and dynamic light scattering techniques. The influence of non-sucrose impurities on the interactive energy contributions between sugarcane juice particles was examined on the basis of Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. Results from these investigations have provided evidence (in terms of particle stability) on why juice particles derived from whole green sugarcane crop are relatively difficult to coagulate (and flocculate). The presence of trash reduces the van der Waals forces of attraction between particles, thereby reducing coagulation and flocculation processes. It is anticipated that further fundamental work will lead to strategies that could be adopted for clarifying juices expressed from whole green sugarcane crop...|$|R

However, the deficiency of carbon may hinder the biodegradability of substrate and decrease the methane yield. Compared with mono-substrate digestion, co-digestion has many benefits including dilution of potential toxic compounds, synergistic effects of microorganisms, improved balance of nutrients, increased digestion rate and better biogas yield (Sosnowski et al. 2003; Cuetos et al. 2011). Many studies have been reported on anaerobic co-digestion with <b>crop</b> <b>stalk</b> and animal manure (Søndergaard et al. 2015; Awais et al. 2016; Hassan et al. 2017). The substrate selection for co-digestion depends from the amount of feedstock and the cost of collection and transportation (Asam et al. 2011). Sweet potato vine (SPV) and animal manure are typical agricultural wastes in the world, especially in China. The annual production of animal manure has exceeded 2.1 billion tons since 2011 in China (Zhu and Ma 2014). Meanwhile, 106.64 million tons of sweet potato was harvested in 2015 (National Bureau of Statistics of China 2016), which was 53.32 million tons of fresh SPV calculated by the shoot–root ratio of 0.5.

In this study we systematically analyzed the temporal and spatial patterns of crop stalk resources, evaluated the bioenergy potential of crop stalk resources, and explored possible pathways of developing stalk-based energy strategies in Inner Mongolia. Our results show that the total crop stalk yield in IMAR increased consistently from 1980 to 2008, with an average annual increase of 16. 3 %.

To collect such information, we created different levels of borer damage by comparing treated (biocontrol vs. insecticide applications) and untreated plots with natural infestation. In the plant cane experiment, damage levels in untreated plots were the highest {{with an average of}} 14. 5 % internodes bored by Chilo spp. and 15. 8 % stalks damaged by S. excerptalis. In comparison, the best treatment obtained with insecticides had only 4. 6 and 3. 8 % damage level respectively, followed by plots treated with Trichogramma releases. The untreated plots had lower sucrose yield, higher fibre content and lower cane yield than all treated plots, which represents a loss in cane yield of 45. 4 t/ha (? 34 %). In the ratoon crop, both yields and the percent of damaged stalks were lower (9. 5 % by top borer and 40 % by stem borers) and the yield reduction in biomass was estimated at 12. 5 t/ha (19. 2 %). In the situation of high infestation as observed in the plant <b>crop,</b> <b>stalk</b> height and other parameters were affected, particularly when damaged by S. excerptalis. For this borer, the weight loss per stalk was estimated at 40. 8 % compared to 15 % from stemborer damage (2. 7 times less). Using these figures, the overall economic impact was calculated, knowing the relationship between weighted borer damage and sucrose yield in plant cane, the cost of applications and the net value per tonne of extra sugar. Therefore, a damage threshold can be applied to trigger control strategies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

Corn stover {{mass and}} {{moisture}} properties were identified to aid decisions regarding collection of standing corn stover dry matter with least moisture, and to aid development of moisture prediction tools for applications including harvest, transport, size reduction, and storage. Vertical distributions of mass and moisture in standing stalks and aboveground components such as leaf, husk, and ear in standing corn plants were evaluated over time. Stalks were cut into 254 mm long sections to facilitate analysis, and {{to correspond with}} billet length collected for cane-type <b>crops.</b> <b>Stalks</b> had the greatest wet mass (72. 6 %) followed by leaf (20. 7 %) and husk (6. 8 %) during the normal harvest period. Moisture profile in aboveground plant components exhibited two separate, sequential linear relationships when plotted with time. The first zone was rapid moisture reduction prior to the normal harvest period. The second zone, corresponding with but {{not the result of}} grain harvest, had slow, gradual moisture reduction and stabilization. Geometrical analyses of stalk cross-sectional area, volume, and lateral surface area to volume ratio documented physical properties for future moisture prediction tools. Considering stalks only, the bottom 1 to 4 stalk sections had 60. 6 % of total dry matter, although that was the last portion of the stalk to dry, thereby increasing the liability of added moisture on transportation and storage. An apparent drying front moved downward through the plant over time and may be explained by reduced the lateral surface area to volume ratio from stalk top to stalk bottom. Dry matter and moisture content of stalks were not significantly influenced by the observed soil and environmental parameters, including rainfall.

Among the above harvesting methods, the integral <b>crop</b> (<b>stalks</b> and tubers at flowering time), showed the highest yield potential of total sugars (fructose + glucose) and inulin (18. 6 and 17. 9 t/ha, respectively). This was obtained by the clone Violette de Rennes, which also had the greatest inulin chain length, in the text reported as average degree of polymerisation (DP). Clone 69 produced the highest yield of sugars and inulin, when the stalks are harvested at flowering (10. 4 and 8. 0 t/ha, respectively), while clone 17, with the conventional harvest of tubers {{at the end of}} crop cycle, reached 13. 3 and 13. 7 t/ha of total sugars and inulin, respectively. The average inulin chain length (DP) was highest at flowering time in both stalks and tubers with a range of 7. 5 – 11. 2 in the genotypes studied, while, at the final harvest of tubers, it significantly decreased reaching values ranging from 4. 8 to 6. 7.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were conducted {{over two years}} in Indonesia (East Java) to investigate damage levels, yield decline and economic impact of three major sugarcane moth borers Chilo sacchariphagus and C. auricilius (referred to as stem borers) and Scirpophaga excerptalis (referred to as top borer). Different levels of borer damage were created to allow comparison between plots treated, i. e. biocontrol and insecticide applications and untreated plots that were naturally infested. In the plant cane experiment, damage levels in untreated plots were the highest, {{with an average of}} 14. 5 % internodes bored by Chilo spp. and 15. 8 % stalks damaged by S. excerptalis. In comparison, the level obtained with insecticides was only 4. 6 % and 3. 8 % damage respectively, followed by plots treated with Trichogramma releases at the rate of 100 000 /ha. The untreated plots had lower sucrose yield, higher fibre content and lower cane yield compared with all treated plots, which represented a loss in biomass of 45. 4 tonnes/ha or 34 % lower yield compared with the treated plots. In the ratoon crop, both yield and percent damaged stalks were lower i. e. 9. 5 % and 40 % by top and stem borers, respectively, and the biomass yield reduction was 12. 5 t/ha or 19. 2 % lower than the treated plots. Where high infestation was recorded in the plant <b>crop,</b> <b>stalk</b> height and other stalk quality parameters were adversely affected, particularly by damage due to S. excerptalis. The latter borer caused a 40. 8 % reduction in stalk mass compared to 15 % due to stem borer; a 2. 7 magnitude difference. The economic impact of these borers was calculated using the values obtained from this loss study, in addition to: information known about the relationship between weighted borer damage and sucrose yield in plant cane; the cost of applications, and the net value per tonne of sugar yield gain. It was possible thereafter to derive a damage threshold that can be consulted to determine when to apply control strategies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Page(s) : 6 (2), 40 - 48, 10 RefA field {{experiment}} was conducted for two consecutive seasons (1994 / 95 and 1995 / 96) at the research farm of Kenana Sugar Company {{to study the}} damage inflicted by weeds on sugarcane yield and quality. Losses in yield due {{to the presence of}} weeds were estimated at 58. 1 %. Six months after planting, weed competition reduced <b>crop</b> stand (<b>stalk</b> population) by 67. 7 % and lowered the stalk height by 21. 4 % at harvest. Stalk thickness was insensitive to competition. Weed competition during the first 45 days did not affect the final yield, but its continuation beyond this period drastically reduced yield components, and the magnitude of the reduction was a function of the duration of competition. Tillering was mostly affected by weed competition, while the effect on juice quality was insignificant. Khartoum University Pres...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} there is {{considerable}} debate on alternative feedstocks for bioethanol production to meet the mandated blending requirements with fossil fuels (petrol). Worldwide, a number of feedstocks ranging from cereal grains to sugarcane juice to molasses (obtained from conversion of cane juice to sugar) are commonly being used. However, these feedstocks are being critically examined for their role in increasing food costs and compromising on food security. Sweet sorghum has emerged as an alternative <b>crop</b> whose <b>stalks</b> are converted into juice for ethanol production. Two models for conversion of sweet sorghum into ethanol have been pilot tested, ie., a centralized model (stalks supplied directly to the distillery for ethanol production) and a decentralized model where the syrup produced at village level is supplied to distillery for ethanol production. A number issues and strengths in using sweet sorghum as an alternative feedstock have emerged...|$|R
40|$|Stalk lodging {{resistance}} {{is a particularly}} important trait on maize, {{especially in terms of}} mechanized harvesting of the <b>crop.</b> <b>Stalk</b> lodging represents a major problem of corn with yield losses. Because of this reason, it takes a special attention on the breeding process. The purpose of this research was the study of maize stalk lodging resistance before the harvest time and finding the best breeding lines for this type of resistance. We used  7 breeding lines (TE 229, TE 202 B, TA 452, TE 330 A, TD 364, TE 317 and TE 335) as maternal lines and another  3 (TD 268, TC 385 A and TC 399) as testers. Lines were tested in 2011 and 2012, in compared cultures with 24  variants, where 21 of them were the experimental hybrids between tested lines and testers and the other 3 were the control hybrids Turda 201, Turda Favorit and PR 39 D 81. Variance analysis was performed according to the classical model of a two-factor system. Genic effects were calculated after 2 nd North Carolina model. Regarding the results, the highest percentage of unbroken plants was on TD 268 tester (80. 7 %) and the lowest on TD 364  tested line (70. 2 %). Tested lines that was noted for the general combining ability of lodging resistance were TA  452 and TE 335. Crossings that marked high values for non-additive effects were TA 452 x TC 385 A, TE 202 B x TC 399 and TE 202 B x TD 268. Effects values for general combining ability were between - 4. 72 % and + 4. 49 % on tested lines, - 1. 68 % and + 5. 78 % on testers; effects values for specific combining ability were between - 11. 25 % and + 7. 58 %. Regarding the tested lines was noted TA 452 inbred line and regarding the testers was noted TD 268  inbred line. On this issue, we can state that in the selection process of maize hybrids must be chosen only those hybrid combinations with stalk-lodging resistance because of the similar contribution of additive and non-additive genic effects to resistant genotypes...|$|R

40|$|Goss’s wilt {{is caused}} by the {{bacterium}} Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis (Cmn). The survival of Cmn in soil and crop residues was examined by Schuster (1975). Pure cultures of the bacterium in soil did not survive for long (less than two weeks), however the bacterium was able to survive for up to 10 months in infested surface crop residue. When the <b>crop</b> residue (leaves, <b>stalks,</b> cobs and ears) was buried at 4 inches or 8 inches, the bacterium was only detected in stalks residue after 10 months. Thus, conservation tillage practices that partially bury infested crop residue should reduce survival of the Goss’s wilt bacterium. Any tillage done must take into account soil conservation. Rotating to a non-host crop, such as soybean, will allow time for infested residues to breakdown and inoculum levels to decrease...|$|R
40|$|Water deficit {{occurring}} after flowering in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] predisposes the <b>crop</b> to <b>stalk</b> rot, mainly due {{to infection}} by the charcoal rot causal fungus Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid., resulting in lodging. The line source (LS) sprinkler irrigation technique which produces a gradient of water deficit stress due to decreasing {{amount of water}} supply with increasing distance from the sprinkler line was used to study the relationships between applied water levels, time of inoculation {{and the degree of}} charcoal rot incidence. Grain yields were reduced in proportion to the deficit in water supply along the gradient, whereas the incidence of charcoal rot increased. Inoculation with the fungus increased the incidence of disease when natural incidence was low. Sorghum was more susceptible to disease during the later stages of grain filling than during the period immediately after flowering. The rows of plants farthest from the LS, which received the least irrigation, showed disease incidence earlier than those nearest, which were better watered. This was apparent {{for each of the three}} different, but highly correlated, parameters of disease spread: percentage of soft stalks; number of nodes crossed; and the length of fungal spread (cm). It is concluded that the LS is an effective method to study the quantitative relationship between severity of water stress and the degree of charcoal rot incidence during rainfree dry seasons...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of rye (Secale cereale) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) winter cover <b>crops</b> and cotton <b>stalk</b> and root destruction (i. e., pulling them up) were evaluated in field tests during two growing seasons for Hoplolaimus columbus management in cotton. The effect of removing {{debris from the}} field following root destruction also was evaluated. Wheat and rye produced similar amounts of biomass, and both crops produced more biomass (P ≤ 0. 05) following cotton root destruction. Cover crops did not suppress H. columbus population levels or increase subsequent cotton yields. Cotton root destruction did not affect cotton stand or plant height the following year. Cotton root destruction lowered (P ≤ 0. 05) H. columbus population levels at planting in 1996 but not in 1997, but cotton yield was not increased by root destruction in either year. Removing debris following root destruction did not lower H. columbus levels compared to leaving debris on the soil surface. This study suggests that a rye or wheat cover crop or cotton root destruction following harvest is ineffective for H. columbus management in cotton...|$|R
40|$|The {{destruction}} of the cotton <b>crop</b> residues (cotton <b>stalks)</b> is a mandatory procedure in Brazil for prophylactic issues, but is a subject unexplored by the research and there are few studies that deal with this issue. However, this is not encouraged in recent decades, studies aimed at developing and evaluating equipment for this purpose. The present study had the objective to evaluate six methods for mechanical {{destruction of}} cotton crop residues. Each method was defined {{based on the principle}} of operation of the active parts of the equipment, which were tested in medium texture soil and in a clayey one. The variables used to evaluate the efficiency of the equipment were the regrowth rate, the theoretical field capacity and energy demand. The equipment with convergent concave disks (DCC) and flat cutters discs from manufacturer A (CPS-a) showed the best results in cotton stalks destruction in both soil types. The harrow disc (GPD) was efficient only in clay soil. It was concluded that the equipment with convergent concave disks, among those tested, was the most efficient to destroy cotton stalks, regardless of soil type, and that the harrow disc was not included among the best performers...|$|R
40|$|High {{nitrogen}} (N) application {{rates are}} used by maize growers as an ‘insurance’, but may have an adverse effect on the environment. In this paper, the potential for nitrogen savings {{by the use of}} site-specific N fertilization rates is reviewed. Various tools for a more precise assessment of N requirements are available. Adjustments of N rates to the amounts of soil mineral N present shortly before planting can contribute to efficient N use, as can a deliberate delay of N dressings combined with indicator-based N supplementation after emergence. Conditions, under which these strategies are effective, are discussed. Post-emergence tests indicate whether a crop is likely to respond to sidedress N, but few tests quantify how much N should be sidedressed. Tissue tests are of less value for the support of decisions on N supplementation than indicators that are directly related to the soil or to the measurement of leaf and canopy greenness. Greenness and tissue tests are both unable to quantify excessive availability of N at early crop stages, as opposed to soil related indicators. Moreover, all crop tests generally need an on-site calibration with a reference plot. At later sampling dates, indicators can provide clues for the adjustment of N management in subsequent maize <b>crops.</b> The late <b>stalk</b> nitrate test and the post-harvest soil mineral N test appear to be the most valuable. Although indicators capable of identifying fields with an excessive N availability may save money, little {{attention has been paid to}} a cost-benefit analysis of indicator-based site-specific N management...|$|R
