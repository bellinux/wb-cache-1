6000|$|I had {{a friend}} once, an angler, who in winter was fond of another sport. He liked to cast his louis into the green baize pond at Monte Carlo, and, on the whole, he was {{generally}} [...] "broken." [...] He seldom landed the golden fish of the old man's dream in Theocritus. When the croupier had gaffed all his money he would repent and say, [...] "Now, that would have kept me at Loch Leven for a fortnight." [...] One used to wonder whether a fortnight of Loch Leven was worth an afternoon of the pleasure of losing at Monte Carlo. The loch has a name for being cockneyfied, beset by whole fleets of competitive anglers from various angling clubs in Scotland. That men should competitively angle shows, indeed, a great want of true angling sentiment. To fish in a crowd is odious, to work hard for prizes of flasks and <b>creels</b> and fly-books is to mistake {{the true meaning of}} the pastime. However, in this crowded age men are so constituted that they like to turn a contemplative exercise into a kind of Bank Holiday. There is no use in arguing with such persons; the worst of their pleasure is that it tends to change a Scotch loch into something like the pond of the Welsh Harp, at Hendon. It is always good news to read in the papers how the Dundee Walton Society had a bad day, and how the first prize was won by Mr. Macneesh, with five trout weighing three pounds and three quarters. Loch Leven, then, is crowded and cockneyfied by competitions; it has also no great name for beauty of landscape. Every one to his own taste in natural beauty, but in this respect I think Loch Leven is better than its reputation. It is certainly more pictorial, so to speak, than some remote moor lochs up near Cape Wrath; Forsinard in particular, where the scenery looks like one gigantic series of brown [...] "baps," [...] flat Scotch scones, all of low elevation, all precisely similar to each other.|$|E

This is the sixth of a planned annual <b>creel</b> survey to be conducted on alternating sections of the channelized Missouri River to measure changes in recreational fishing activity, especially those changes due to large scale habitat restoration efforts. We returned to the Bellevue to Camp Creek reach in 2005 {{because we had to}} cancel the <b>creel</b> on this reach in 2004 after the second <b>creel</b> period due to lack of personnel. Future reports will contain additional analyses of these data. Only one <b>creel</b> was conducted during the first <b>creel</b> period because of lack of personnel. Anglers spent over 29, 000 hours fishing the Missouri River from Bellevue (rkm 967. 7) to Camp Creek (rkm 883. 5) during the survey period. Effort remained relatively steady throughout the survey. The Plattsmouth and Nebraska City segments accounted for over 63 % of the effort. Anglers targeted catfish (blue, channel and flatheads) over 51 % of the time that they were fishing. Inside bends were the most commonly fished macrohabitat, accounting for over 52 % of the total angling effort. Anglers caught over 7, 800 and harvested over 7, 800 fish from 2 April through 14 October 2005 while fishing the Missouri River. Catch was spread out through the year but anglers fishing the Plattsmouth and Nebraska City reaches caught over 61 % of the fish. Total catch rates ranged from 0. 17 fish per hour during the third (5 / 28 - 6124) and fifth (7 / 23 - 8119) <b>creel</b> period to 0. 34 fish per hour during the second <b>creel</b> period (4 / 30 - 5127).

6000|$|July 27th.--We {{are still}} at Newby Bridge, and nothing has {{occurred}} of remarkable interest, nor have we made any excursions, beyond moderate walks. Two days have been rainy, and to-day there is more rain. We find such weather as tolerable here as {{it would probably be}} anywhere; but it passes rather heavily with the children,--and for myself, I should prefer sunshine. Though Mr. White's books afford me some entertainment, especially an odd volume of Ben Jonson's plays, containing [...] "Volpone," [...] "The Alchemist," [...] "Bartholomew Fair," [...] and others. [...] "The Alchemist" [...] is certainly a great play. We watch all arrivals and other events from our parlor window,--a stage-coach driving up four times in the twenty-four hours, with its forlorn outsiders, all saturated with rain; the steamer, from the head of the lake, landing a crowd of passengers, who stroll up to the hotel, drink a glass of ale, lean over the parapet of the bridge, gaze at the flat stones which pave the bottom of the Liver, and then hurry back to the steamer again; cars, phaetons, horsemen, all damped and disconsolate. There are a number of young men staying at the hotel, some of whom go forth in all the rain, fishing, and come back at nightfall, trudging heavily, but with <b>creels</b> on their backs that do not seem very heavy. Yesterday was fair, and enlivened us a good deal. Returning from a walk in the forenoon, I found a troop of yeomanry cavalry in the stable-yard of the hotel. They were the North Lancashire Regiment, and {{were on their way to}} Liverpool for the purpose of drill. Not being old campaigners, their uniforms and accoutrements were in so much the finer order, all bright, and looking span-new, and they themselves were a body of handsome and stalwart young men; and it was pleasant to look at their helmets, and red jackets and carbines, and steel scabbarded swords, and gallant steeds,--all so martial in aspect,--and to know that they were only play-soldiers, after all, and were never likely to do nor suffer any warlike mischief. By and by their bugles sounded, and they trotted away, wheeling over the ivy-grown stone bridge, and disappearing behind the trees on the Milnethorpe road. Our host comes forth from the bar with a bill, which he presents to an orderly-sergeant. He, the host, then tells me that he himself once rode many years, a trooper, in this regiment, and that all his comrades were larger men than himself. Yet Mr. Thomas White is a good-sized man, and now, at all events, rather overweight for a dragoon.|$|E
6000|$|I {{said just}} now, that happy was the sportsman {{who was also}} a naturalist. And, having once {{mentioned}} these curious water-flies, I cannot help going a little farther, and saying, that lucky is the fisherman who is also a naturalist. A fair scientific knowledge of the flies which he imitates, and of their habits, would often ensure him sport, while other men are going home with empty <b>creels.</b> [...] One would have fancied this a self-evident fact; yet I have never found any sound knowledge of the natural water-flies which haunt a given stream, except among cunning old fishermen of the lower class, who get their living by the gentle art, and bring to indoors baskets of trout killed on flies, which look {{as if they had been}} tied with a pair of tongs, so rough and ungainly are they; but which, nevertheless, kill, simply because they are (in COLOUR, which is all that fish really care for) exact likenesses of some obscure local species, which happen to be on the water at the time. [...] Among gentlemen-fishermen, on the other hand, so deep is the ignorance of the natural fly, that I have known good sportsmen still under the delusion that the great green May-fly comes out of a caddis-bait; the gentlemen having never seen, much less fished with, that most deadly bait the [...] "Water-cricket," [...] or free creeping larva of the May-fly, which may be found in May under the river- banks. The consequence of this ignorance is that they depend for good patterns of flies on mere chance and experiment; and that the shop patterns, originally excellent, deteriorate continually, till little or no likeness to their living prototype remains, being tied by town girls, who have no more understanding of what the feathers and mohair in their hands represent than they have of what the National Debt represents. Hence follows many a failure at the stream-side; because the [...] "Caperer," [...] or [...] "Dun," [...] or [...] "Yellow Sally," [...] which is produced from the fly-book, though, possibly, like the brood which came out three years since on some stream a hundred miles away, is quite unlike the brood which is out to-day on one's own river. For not only do most of these flies vary in colour in different soils and climates, but many of them change their hue during life; the Ephemerae, especially, have a habit of throwing off the whole of their skins (even, marvellously enough, to the skin of the eyes and wings, and the delicate [...] "whisks" [...] at their tail), and appearing in an utterly new garb after ten minutes' rest, to the discomfiture of the astonished angler.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{six miles}} of macadamised road showed {{us that the}} team could move. A railway ran {{between us and the}} banks of the Willamette, and another above us through the mountains. All the land was dotted with small townships, and the roads were full of farmers in their town wagons, bunches of tow-haired, boggle-eyed urchins sitting in the hay behind. The men {{generally}} looked like loafers, but their women were all well dressed. Brown hussar-braiding on a tailor-made jacket does not, however, consort with hay-wagons. Then we struck into the woods along what California called a [...] "camina reale,"--a good road,--and Portland a [...] "fair track." [...] It wound in and out among fire-blackened stumps, under pine trees, along the corners of log-fences, through hollows which must be hopeless marsh in the winter, and up absurd gradients. But nowhere throughout its length did I see any evidence of road-making. There was a track,--you couldn't well get off it,--and it was all you could do to stay on it. The dust lay a foot thick in the blind ruts, and under the dust we found bits of planking and bundles of brushwood that sent the wagon bounding into the air. Sometimes we crashed through bracken; anon where the blackberries grew rankest we found a lonely little cemetery, the wooden rails all awry, and the pitiful stumpy headstones nodding drunkenly at the soft green mulleins. Then with oaths and the sound of rent underwood a yoke of mighty bulls would swing down a [...] "skid" [...] road, hauling a forty-foot log along a rudely made slide. A valley full of wheat and cherry trees succeeded, and halting at a house we bought ten pound weight of luscious black cherries for something less than a rupee and got a drink of icy-cold water for nothing, while the untended team browsed sagaciously by the roadside. Once we found a wayside camp of horse-dealers lounging by a pool, ready for a sale or a swap, and once two sun-tanned youngsters shot down a hill on Indian ponies, their full <b>creels</b> banging from the high-pommelled saddles.

Above all, California told tales of Nevada and Arizona, of lonely nights spent out prospecting, of the slaughter of deer and the chase of men; of woman, lovely woman, who is a firebrand in a Western city, and leads to the popping of pistols, and of the sudden changes and chances of Fortune, who delights in making the miner or the lumberman a quadruplicate millionnaire, and in [...] "busting" [...] the railroad king. That was a day to be remembered, and it had only begun when we drew rein at a tiny farmhouse {{on the banks of the}} Clackamas and sought horse-feed and lodging ere we hastened to the river that broke over a weir not a quarter of a mile away.|$|E

To <b>creel,</b> the creeler stood behind the mule, he placed new bobbins on the shelf above the <b>creel.</b> As the bobbin ran empty he would pick it off its skewer in the <b>creel</b> unreeling 30cm or so of roving, and drop it into a skip. With his left hand, he would place on the new bobbin onto the skewer from above and with his right hand twist in the new roving into the tail of the last.|$|R
