5000|$|Intake {{camshaft}} {{valve cover}} {{now has the}} [...] "16 Valve" [...] portion in red instead of blue (this {{is not to be}} confused with the smallport 3rd generation 4A-GE where the intake <b>camshaft</b> <b>cover</b> lettering has the entire [...] "Twin Cam 16 Valve" [...] in red) ...|$|E
5000|$|The LT3 (RPO code) or C20GET is a {{turbocharged}} version {{produced in}} Brazil for the North American market. It featured brilliant red powder coating on the <b>camshaft</b> <b>cover,</b> intake manifold and boost pipe. And {{was equipped with}} a water-cooled Garrett T-25 turbocharger; however it did not utilize an intercooler. Maximum boost at WOT was [...]|$|E
50|$|The balance shafts are {{relocated}} {{from the}} cylinder block to oil pan module. The two-piece steel-aluminum oil pan features in-pan integrated oil-pump assembly {{driven by the}} balance shaft with a shorter inverted-tooth chain. Other improvements include inverted-tooth chain driving the camshaft, forged steel crankshaft, cast aluminum bedplate with main bearing cap inserts made of iron, high-pressure fuel rail with rubber-isolated assembly, acoustically shielded plastic cover for the intake manifold, and structurally enhanced aluminum <b>camshaft</b> <b>cover</b> and front cover. These improvements helped reduce noise intensity by 40% compared to the 2.4 L engine and change the noise signature into a higher frequency above 2,000 Hz. The engine also uses a variable-displacement oil pump and an actively controlled thermostat. Direct injection reduces emissions by 25%, while continuous cam phasing {{eliminates the need for}} an EGR system. Maximum engine speed is listed at 7000 RPM.|$|E

50|$|Valves {{are driven}} by roller-follower rocker arms with low {{friction}} roller bearings, and a unique, concave cam lobe design to increase valve lift over the traditional shimless lifter type system of the 1GR-FE. This increases overall cylinder head height to accommodate the slightly taller roller rocker system. Moreover, the cylinder head is segmented into 3 parts: valve <b>cover,</b> <b>camshaft</b> sub-assembly housing, and cylinder head sub-assembly. As such, this valvetrain is used across all other GR engines with Dual VVT-i. Its service weight is 163 kg.|$|R
500|$|To {{make the}} R as compact as possible, several design {{modifications}} {{were made in}} comparison to the Buzzard: the propeller reduction gear housing was reshaped, and the <b>camshaft</b> and rocker <b>covers</b> were modified to fair into the shape of the aircraft's nose, the air intake was positioned in the vee of the engine (which also helped to avoid the ingress of spray), and beneath the engine the auxiliaries were raised a little to reduce the depth of the fuselage. The engine's length was minimised by not staggering its cylinder banks fore and aft, which meant that the connecting rods from opposing cylinders had to share a short crankshaft bearing journal known as the [...] "big end". This was initially achieved by fitting one connecting rod inside the other at the lower end in a blade and fork arrangement; however, after cracking of the connecting rods was found during testing in 1931, the rod design was changed to an articulated type.|$|R
5000|$|The GTA had {{aluminium}} {{outer body}} panels instead of steel, (the inner steel panels were also of thinner gauge, {{the inner and}} outer panels were bonded and pop-riveted together), magnesium alloy wheels, clear plastic side windows, an aluminium rear upper control arm, different door handles and quarter window mechanisms, and lightweight interior trim. The engine had a new double ignition cylinder head (called twin plug, later in the eighties the system was called twin spark) cylinder head with a Marelli distributor from a Ferrari Dino, 45 mm carburetors instead of 40 mm and magnesium <b>camshaft</b> <b>cover,</b> sump, timing cover and bell housing. The transmission gear ratios were closer than standard and the gears were machined for lightness and quicker shifting. Dry weight of the 1600 was approximately 1640 lb. In stradale form this car boasted approximately [...] (up from [...] ). In full race form this engine could produce up to [...] The 1600 GTA did not have a brake booster and had a thicker radiator than the standard vehicle. For homologation 500 cars were made for racing and road use.|$|E
5000|$|The Alfa Romeo GTA {{retained}} the external {{form of the}} Giulia Sprint GT, but was constructed with aluminum external panels replacing the standard steel panels. The 'A' stood for [...] "Alleggerita", Italian for [...] "lightened". The engine was based on that of the standard 1600 cc car with a new, twin-plug head and Weber 45DCOE carburettors. The sump, <b>camshaft</b> <b>cover,</b> timing cover and clutch housing were in lightweight magnesium alloy instead of the standard aluminium alloy. Many other measures were also taken to lighten the car, and tune it for racing. All GTA's had the lower rear wheelarches as fitted to the Giulia Sprint GT's and GTV's, and very early GT 1300 Juniors. The GTA was available from the factory as a high-performance car for the road or racing. Unmodified cars in factory trim {{have come to be}} known as [...] "GTA Stradale" [...] but few were sold in this form. Most customers were racers and had them further modified and tuned before delivery by Autodelta, which had become a wholly owned Alfa Romeo subsidiary running its competition department.|$|E
5000|$|The R was a {{physically}} imposing engine {{designed by a}} team led by Ernest Hives and including Cyril Lovesey, Arthur Rowledge and Henry Royce. The R shared the Buzzard's bore, stroke and capacity, and used the same 60-degree V-12 layout. A new single-stage, double-sided supercharger impeller was designed along with revised cylinders and strengthened connecting rods. The wet-liner cylinder blocks, crankcase and propeller reduction gear castings were produced from [...] "R.R 50" [...] aluminium alloy; and because of the short life expectancy of these engines, forged aluminium was used to replace bronze and steel in many parts. To make the R as compact as possible, several design modifications were made in comparison to the Buzzard: the propeller reduction gear housing was reshaped, and the <b>camshaft</b> and rocker <b>covers</b> were modified to fair into the shape of the aircraft's nose, the air intake was positioned in the vee of the engine (which also helped to avoid the ingress of spray), and beneath the engine the auxiliaries were raised a little to reduce the depth of the fuselage.
