50|$|In telephony, common-channel {{signaling}} (CCS), in the US also <b>common-channel</b> <b>interoffice</b> <b>signaling</b> (CCIS), is {{the transmission}} of signaling information (control information) on a separate channel than the data, and, more specifically, where that signaling channel controls multiple data channels.|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, AT&T {{introduced}} its Common Channel <b>Interoffice</b> <b>Signaling</b> (CCIS) {{network and the}} Network Services System (NSS) database for providing its own centralized facility for Toll-Free Number translation and service provisioning.|$|R
50|$|Security holes within Signalling System No. 7 (SS7), called Common Channel Signalling System 7 (CCSS7) in the US and Common Channel <b>Interoffice</b> <b>Signaling</b> 7 (CCIS7) in the UK, were {{demonstrated}} at Chaos Communication Congress, Hamburg in 2014.|$|R
50|$|In North America it {{is often}} {{referred}} to as CCSS7, abbreviated for Common Channel Signalling System 7. In the United Kingdom, it is called C7 (CCITT number 7), number 7 and CCIS7 (Common Channel <b>Interoffice</b> <b>Signaling</b> 7). In Germany, {{it is often}} called N7 (Signalisierungssystem Nummer 7).|$|R
25|$|These {{systems could}} use the old {{electromechanical}} signaling methods inherited from crossbar and step-by-step switches. They also introduced {{a new form of}} data communications: two 1ESS exchanges could communicate with one another using a data link called Common Channel <b>Interoffice</b> <b>Signaling,</b> (CCIS). This data link was based on CCITT 6, a predecessor to SS7.|$|R

50|$|SS5 {{and earlier}} systems used in-band signaling, {{in which the}} call-setup {{information}} was sent by playing special multi-frequency tones into the telephone lines, known as bearer channels. As the bearer channel was directly accessible by users, it was exploited with devices such as the blue box, which played the tones required for call control and routing. As a remedy, SS6 and SS7 implemented out-of-band signaling, carried in a separate signaling channel, thus keeping the speech path separate. SS6 and SS7 {{are referred to as}} common-channel signaling (CCS) protocols, or Common Channel <b>Interoffice</b> <b>Signalling</b> (CCIS) systems.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{the phone}} {{companies}} in North America did, in fact, replace all their hardware. They didn't do it to stop the phreaks, but simply {{as a matter of}} course while moving to fully digital switching systems. Unlike the crossbar switch, where the switching signals and voice were carried on the same lines, the new systems used separate signaling lines which phreaks could not access. This system is known as Common Channel <b>Interoffice</b> <b>Signaling.</b> Classic phreaking with the 2600 Hz tone continued to work in more remote locations into the 1980s, but was of little use in North America by the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{designed}} {{along with}} the panel type telephone office, PCI was intended to allow subscribers in fully automated exchanges to dial numbers in manual offices {{the same way they}} dialed numbers in their own exchange. For PCI to achieve its purpose, the panel office sent the requested number to the manual office, where the number was lit on an operator's display. The switchboard operator at a PCI-aware manual office reads the number from the call indicator display and completes the call in the usual way. As a format of <b>interoffice</b> <b>signaling,</b> PCI is one of multiple options retained for compatibility in the #5 Crossbar switch, a later system which served as the platform for the initial DTMF push-button telephone services.|$|R
50|$|During this era, most voice {{connections}} used {{analog trunk}} circuits {{that were designed}} to conform with the Via Net Loss plan established by Bell Laboratories. The purpose of the VNL plan and five-level long distance switching hierarchy was to minimize the number of trunk circuits in a call and maximize the voice quality of the connections. Excessive loss in a voice connection meant that subscribers may have difficulty hearing each other. This was particularly important in the 1960s when dial up data connections were developed {{with the use of}} analog modems. The SES evaluated multi-frequency outpulsing signaling as well as voice impairments including sound amplitude, noise, echo, {{and a variety of other}} parameters. Deployment of common-channel signaling systems such as Common Channel <b>Interoffice</b> <b>Signaling</b> and later Signaling System #7 obviated the need to monitor multi-frequency signaling as it became obsolete.|$|R
50|$|A {{blue box}} is an {{electronic}} device that simulated an operator by generating the same tones employed by a telephone operator's dialing console to, for example, switch long-distance calls. A blue box {{is a tool}} {{that emerged in the}} 1960s and '70s; it allowed users to route their own calls by emulating the in-band signaling mechanism that then controlled switching in long distance dialing systems. The most typical use of a blue box was to place free telephone calls. A related device, the black box, enabled one to receive calls which were free to the caller. The blue box no longer works in most Western nations, as modern switching systems do not use in-band signaling. Instead, signaling occurs on an out-of-band channel which cannot be accessed from the line the caller is using, a system called Common Channel <b>Interoffice</b> <b>Signaling</b> or CCIS.|$|R
