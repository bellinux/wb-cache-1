40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a series of three-dimensional finite element analyses Investigating the ultimate limit state of a <b>circular</b> <b>skirted</b> shallow foundation over a comprehensive range of combined vertical, moment and horizontal loading. Failure loci in V:M:H load space derived from the finite element analyses are compared with limit state predictions from the offshore industry design guidelines. The comparison highlights considerable conservatism of the current design method largely due to poor representation of the response to fully combined loading and neglect of the tensile capacity achieved with foundation skirts. These shortcomings are particularly significant with respect to foundations for offshore conditions and result in an oversight of considerable potential load capacity in design. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{foundation}} embedment on consolidation {{has not been}} considered previously in a systematic manner, although this {{is of particular interest}} for offshore foundations, where embedment is provided by skirts that enclose a compressible soil plug. For skirted foundations, critical uncertainties include what to assume in terms of the degree of drainage at skirt tip level, and the relative time scales of consolidation within the soil plug and beneath the foundation. In this paper, results from small strain finite-element analyses are used to quantify the immediate and time-dependent response of <b>circular</b> <b>skirted</b> foundations to uniaxial vertical loading. Foundations with frictionless and fully rough skirt-soil interfaces with varying ratio of embedment depth to foundation diameter are considered and the responses compared with those for surface foundations. The findings show that both skirt-soil interface roughness and embedment ratio {{have a significant effect on}} the consolidation response. © 2010 ASCE. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of vertical, horizontal and moment (VHM) loads {{acting on a}} shallow foundation is complex, and {{it is becoming increasingly}} popular to represent ultimate limit states under general VHM loading as failure envelopes in three-dimensional load space. General loading is of particular interest offshore, where harsh environmental conditions lead to large horizontal and moment foundation loads. Shallow foundations with peripheral skirts that penetrate into the seabed are used to resist large lateral and overturning forces. During undrained loading, tensile resistance can be mobilised {{on the underside of the}} base plate by suctions developed within the skirt compartment. This paper presents failure envelopes and kinematic mechanisms for undrained ultimate limit states of <b>circular</b> <b>skirted</b> foundations in uniform and heterogeneous deposits under general VHM loading based on finite element results. An approximating method is proposed that permits accurate prediction of ultimate limit states under a full range of general loading. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractShallow {{footings}} {{are subjected}} to lateral forces induced by earthquake movements, wind loads, water wave pressure, lateral earth pressure, and transmitting power cables. In some structures such as water front structure, earth retaining structure and transmitting power structures, the lateral forces acting on the footings may be dominant. There has been little work studying the performance of skirted footings subjected to lateral loads. Twelve loading tests were performed on small scale <b>circular</b> <b>skirted</b> footing to {{shed some light on}} the performance of skirted footings when subjected to lateral loads. The effects of skirt length and the relative density of sand on the performance of the footing were investigated through laboratory testing program. Also a comparative experimental study between ultimate horizontal loads attained by skirted and unskirted footings with the same properties was conducted. From the accomplished laboratory tests {{it was found that the}} skirts changed the failure mode of circular shallow footings from sliding mechanism into rotational mechanism. Also the skirts attached to footings increased appreciably the ultimate horizontal capacity of shallow footings...|$|R
40|$|Large-deformation finite-element {{analysis}} {{has been used}} to model the undrained response of skirted shallow foundations in uplift and compression. Large-deformation effects involve changes in embedment ratio and operative local soil shear strength with increasing foundation displacement-either in tension or compression. Centrifuge model testing has shown that these changes in geometry affect the mobilized bearing capacity and the kinematic mechanisms governing failure in undrained uplift and compression. Small-strain finite-element analysis cannot by definition capture the effects of changing foundation embedment ratio and variation in local soil strength with foundation displacement. In this paper, load-displacement relationships, ultimate capacities, and kinematic mechanisms governing failure from largedeformation finite-element analyses are compared with centrifuge model test results for <b>circular</b> <b>skirted</b> foundations with a range of embedment between 10 and 50 % of the foundation diameter. The results show that the large-deformation finite-element method can replicate the loaddisplacement response of the foundations over large displacements, pre-and postyield, and also capture differences in the soil deformation patterns in uplift and compression. The findings from this study increase confidence in using advanced numerical methods for determining shallow skirted foundation behavior, particularly for load paths involving uplift. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{foundation}} embedment ratio and soil–skirt interface roughness on the consolidated undrained capacity of <b>skirted</b> <b>circular</b> foundations under planar loading in normally consolidated clay {{has been investigated}} through coupled three-dimensional finite element analyses. Results are presented as failure envelopes, and changes in shape {{and size of the}} normalized vertical–horizontal–moment (VHM) failure envelopes are described as a function of relative magnitude and duration of applied preload. Results show that embedment ratio and interface roughness affect the load distribution within the soil mass, but that consolidated undrained capacity under planar loading scales proportionately with the (unconsolidated) undrained capacity of the foundation. This latter feature enables the results to be neatly synthesized into a relatively straightforward method for use in engineering practice for prediction of gain in undrained VHM capacity due to preload and consolidation. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises {{results from}} a {{four-year}} experimental programme of centrifuge tests investigating installation resistance and uplift capacity of shallow <b>skirted</b> <b>circular</b> foundations in lightly over-consolidated clay. Centric and eccentric, monotonic, transient and sustained loading were investigated {{and the effect of}} gapping along the foundation-soil interface was explored. The results from this study showed that for a skirted foundation with embedment ratio d/D= 0. 3, reverse end bearing could be mobilised under transient uplift and loads of up to 50 % of the undrained soil resistance could be sustained for months without significant displacement - provided nominal contact along the skirt-soil interface was maintained. The presence of gapping along the skirt-soil interface and eccentric loading reduced undrained capacity by up to 40 %, and increased displacement rates under sustained uplift loading by up to a factor five. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, London. </p...|$|R

40|$|Shape {{factors of}} a tight skirt and 3 kinds of flared skirts were {{investigated}} precisely. Shape factors of circular fabrics were calculated from mechanical parameters obtained by KES system, however, those of skirts were obtained experimentally.

They were also compared with node number and static drape coefficient of skits at hem line. Following conclusions were obtained. In the case of tight skirt, flare- 1 skirt and flare- 2 skirt, the shape factor showed high correlation with drape parameters of the <b>skirts</b> and <b>circular</b> fabrics. The shape factor of skirts has high positive correlation with node number and negative correlation with static drape coefficient of circular fabrics.

5000|$|The plugs {{consist of}} a <b>circular</b> {{shielding}} metal <b>skirt</b> protecting a number of straight round pins. The pins are 1.45 mm in diameter and equally spaced (at 90°, 72°, 60° or 45° angles) in a 7.0 mm diameter circle.

The basic design also ensures that the shielding is connected between socket and plug prior to any signal path connection being made. However, as the keying is consistent across all connectors, it does not prevent incompatible connectors from mating, which can lead to damage; this is changed in Mini-DIN, which keys different connectors. Additionally, some [...] "domino" [...] 5-pin connectors had a keyway on opposing sides of the plug, allowing it to be reversed.
