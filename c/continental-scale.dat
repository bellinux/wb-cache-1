40|$|Snow is a {{critical}} component in the global energy and hydrologic cycle. Further, {{it is important to}} know the mass of snow because it serves as the dominant source of drinking water for more than one billion people worldwide. Since direct quantification of snow water equivalent (SWE) is complicated by spatial and temporal variability, space-borne passive microwave SWE retrieval products have been utilized over regional and <b>continental-scales</b> to better estimate SWE. Previous studies have explored the possibility of employing machine learning, namely an artificial neural network (ANN) or a support vector machine (SVM), to replace the traditional radiative transfer model (RTM) during brightness temperatures (Tb) assimilation. However, we still need to address the following question: What are the most significant parameters in the machine-learning model based on either ANN or SVM? The goal of this study is to compare and contrast sensitivity analysis of Tb with respect to each model input between the ANN- and SVM-based estimates. In general, the results suggest the SVM (relative to the ANN) may be more beneficial during Tb assimilation studies where enhanced SWE estimation is the main objective...|$|R

Faunal trawl samples were collected between 2007 and 2011 at 78 stations from 30 to 1000 m depth and patterns in biomass, density, richness, diversity, and taxonomic composition were examined in relation to indirect/spatial gradients (e. g., depth), direct gradients (e. g., bottom oceanographic variables), and resource gradients (e. g., food supply proxies). Six benthic community types were defined based on their biomass-based taxonomic composition. Their distribution was significantly, but moderately, associated with large-scale (100 - 1000 km) environmental gradients defined by depth, physical water properties (e. g., bottom salinity), and meso-scale (10 - 100 km) environmental gradients defined by substrate type (hard vs. soft) and sediment organic carbon content. We did not observe a strong decline of bulk biomass, density and richness with depth or a strong increase of those community characteristics with food supply proxies, contrary to our hypothesis. We discuss how local- to meso-scale environmental conditions, such as bottom current regimes and polynyas, sustain biomass-rich communities at specific locations in oligotrophic and in deep regions of the Canadian Arctic.

40|$|High spatial {{resolution}} remotely sensed imagery {{has been widely}} used for land-use and land-cover (LULC) mapping. In the meantime detailed and high accuracy land-cover maps are also increasingly desired by land-use researchers and planners. <b>Continental-scaled</b> land cover maps with moderate {{spatial resolution}} (30 meter) such as National Land Cover Data Sets (NLCD) and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL) were employed as primary LULC data and reference maps. However, the differences in land cover nomenclature of NLCD have been a recurring problem. The relatively coarser resolution of NLCD and NASS CDL also reduces the comparability to classification results of high resolution aerial photography and satellite imagery. Scientific research has revealed a strong demand of new methods for accurate and detailed LULC mapping, especially for the large-scale, complicated and spectrally heterogeneous landscapes. ^ This study examined how to combine object-based and pixel-based approaches for the identification of land-cover types from 1 -meter resolution aerial orthophotography. Specifically, this study included four major procedures: (1) pre-processing the aerial photography by using convolution filters, IHS, and principal component transformation for spatial and spectral information enhancement; (2) addressing building extraction in urban areas from high spatial resolution imagery by defining object-based decision rules to reconfigure the morphology of the initial approximation of building locations and shapes, derived from a 5 -foot Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Digital Surface Model (DSM); (3) selecting suitable features for image object discrimination according to their spectral, contextual, and spatial information, {{as well as their}} morphological characteristics and; and (4) developing object-based methodologies, that employ elevation information as ancillary data for building and vegetation delineation in urban landscapes in Indiana State, as well as for land-cover mapping of the entire Tippecanoe County in Indiana State. Hierarchical classification schemes were developed to discriminate image objects for specific classes. The advantages of different segmentation algorithms were combined to identify feature similarities, both among image objects and with their neighbors. Image growth took place if neighbors of image objects satisfied a series of criteria given a set of class-defined object features. ^ This study also proposed an object-oriented method to extract road information from the NLCD 2001 and to reclassify urban-related fields from the NLCD 1992 and 2001 data sets. The comparability between NLCD 1992 and NLCD 2001 in urban areas was tremendously increased after the recoding and modification of spectral classes. The results of the urban land cover change analysis from the modified datasets were more logical. ^ Classification results from the combined methods were compared with traditional pixel-based classification methods at each study area. Both statistical and visual comparison demonstrated that the object-oriented decision rules, as well as their combination with the pixel-based methods, were more effective for land-cover mapping, and achieved much higher classification accuracies than traditional classification methods. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Developing {{accurate}} predictive distribution models requires adequately representing relevant {{spatial and}} temporal scales, as these scales are ultimately reflective {{of the relationships between}} distributions and influential environmental conditions. In this research, we considered both {{spatial and temporal}} scale and the influence each has on predicting broad-scale distributions of two disparate but related phenomena: land cover and bird distributions. Employing machine-learning algorithms, we first developed land cover time series datasets covering all of California, Oregon, and Washington with a model that simultaneously reflects local-scale heterogeneity and broad-scale homogeneity. We then used these and other land cover time series datasets to investigate the effects of temporal resolution on species distribution models. In the second chapter, we focused on the importance of accurately representing the spatial scale of relationships between predictors and a response variable for broad-scale predictive models. Using both a novel machine-learning algorithm and a novel predictor dataset, we developed dense time series forest canopy cover (FCC) and impervious surface cover (ISC) datasets at a 30 -meter spatial resolution for all of California, Oregon, and Washington. To develop both datasets, we employed a spatial ensemble modeling method using a population of locally defined and spatially overlapping decision trees, making it both appropriate at <b>continental-scales</b> and sensitive to local variation in predictor-response relationships. Our predictor variables were products of LandTrendr, a tool for developing time series images and derivatives from the Landsat archive. To develop the most accurate time series of FCC and ISC, we first tested two model parameters, sample size and estimator size. Using the best-performing configuration of each, we then compared our models with locally defined estimators to bagged decision trees, the most comparable model with globally defined estimators. Using the best-performing models and LandTrendr imagery, we developed yearly FCC and ISC maps, spanning 1990 - 2012. To test the temporal extensibility of our models, we compared our predicted 2011 maps to 2011 maps from the National Land Cover Database. We found that model performance for both FCC and ISC decreased with increasing estimator size and that models with locally defined estimators outperformed bagged decision trees. We also found that our models performed well when extending learned predictor-response relationships to predict 2011 FCC and ISC distributions. These results, in concert with several novel byproducts of the models that we developed, demonstrate that representing local-scale spatial relationships is critical to producing accurate broad-scale distribution models. In the third chapter, we investigated the influence of temporal scale on an avian species distribution model (SDM) by comparing models developed with different temporal resolutions of land cover predictor data. We expressed temporal resolution as the time interval between representative dates of predictor data. By adjusting the temporal resolution of land cover predictors but still using yearly response data, models at coarser resolutions were potentially trained with bird observations that did not match the land cover contemporaneous with observations. We tested different temporal resolutions for five bird species to capture how habitat preference may affect SDM response to temporal resolution. Our results confirmed that temporal resolution has a noticeable effect on SDMs, but in unexpected ways. For three of the five species, the best-performing models were produced at the coarsest temporal resolution, with other species showing better performance at moderate resolutions. We also found only subtle evidence supporting the idea that habitat preference influenced SDM response to temporal resolution. These results indicate that 1) temporal dynamics of avian species-environment relationships are highly complex and specific to individual species and 2) that representation of temporal scale has a prominent effect on model outcome...|$|R
