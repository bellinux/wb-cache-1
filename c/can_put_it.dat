500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Ohno lost over 9kilograms (20 pounds) of weight from when he appeared at the 2002 Winter Games. [...] He went down to a 65.7kg (145lb) bodyframe and a 2.5% Body fat percentage enduring a 5-month 3-a-day training program combined with a strict nutritional program. [...] As a result, he could lift double the weight he could before the training. [...] With respect to his training regimen, Ohno said: [...] "Come these Games, there's no one who's going to be fitter than me. There's just no way. Whether I <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> together on the ice or not and feel good, that's a different story. But I know, from a physical training standpoint, nobody's even close... I've never prepared like this in my life — for anything. [...] I want to leave nothing on the table." ...|$|E
500|$|Lindsey Fraser, who had {{supplied}} {{one of the}} blurb comments, wrote what {{is thought}} to be the first published review, in The Scotsman on 28 June 1997.

Another early review, in The Herald, said, [...] "I have yet to find a child who <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> down." [...] Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews in The Guardian, The Sunday Times and The Mail on Sunday, and in September 1997 Books for Keeps, a magazine that specialised in children's books, gave the novel four stars out of five. The Mail on Sunday rated it as [...] "the most imaginative debut since Roald Dahl"; a view echoed by the Sunday Times ("comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified"), while The Guardian called it [...] "a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit" [...] and The Scotsman said it had [...] "all the makings of a classic".|$|E

500|$|Upon {{joining the}} Marlins in 2006, Ross {{was forced to}} shave his beard, in order {{to comply with the}} Marlins' no facial hair policy. Manager Joe Girardi quipped, [...] "Maybe he <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on top of his head." [...] He was used as a backup outfielder but got many starts at all three outfield {{positions}} throughout the year, especially from June 10 through 30, July 21 through August 8, and September 11 {{through the end of the}} season. On September 11, Ross hit a three-run home run against David Williams and a pair of two-run home runs against Heath Bell and Royce Ring in a 16–5 win over the New York Mets.

2500|$|In September 2010, a fan-made mash-up of {{the video}} and a Sesame Street segment {{appeared}} online. The original Sesame Street clip featured a puppet portrayed as a young black girl proud of her hair. She flails her braids, cornrows, afro, and other ethnic hairstyles.

[...] Noting that the norm is not to be [...] "sassy" [...] or [...] "cute", she said that [...] "Whip My Hair" [...] is [...] "a celebration of little girls celebrating themselves".|$|E
