2500|$|The Act makes {{amendments}} to the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 relating to prosecution and defence disclosure. The old system was that the prosecution would provide initial disclosure to the defence (known as [...] "primary disclosure"), the defence would provide a [...] "defence statement" [...] and the prosecution would provide [...] "secondary disclosure" [...] {{in response to that}} defence statement. Now the prosecution are under a <b>continuous</b> <b>duty</b> to disclose evidence, though the defence statement would impose a revised and stricter (depending on the contents and detail of the defence statement) test. The test for disclosure [...] "evidence which undermines the prosecution case or assists the defence case" [...] remains, though the prosecutor's own opinion of whether unused evidence meets those criteria is replaced by an objective test. However, the defence still cannot force the prosecutor to disclose such evidence until a defence statement is produced, so this change means little in practice.|$|E
2500|$|Medical residencies {{traditionally}} require lengthy {{hours of}} their trainees. Early residents literally resided at the hospitals, often working in unpaid positions during their education. During this time, a resident might always be [...] "on call" [...] or share that duty {{with just one}} other practitioner. More recently, 36-hour shifts were separated by 12 hours of rest, during 100+ hour weeks. [...] The American public, and the medical education establishment, recognized that such long hours were counter-productive, since sleep deprivation increases rates of medical errors. [...] This was noted in a landmark study {{on the effects of}} sleep deprivation and error rate in an Intensive-care unit. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has limited the number of work-hours to 80 hours weekly (averaged over 4 weeks), overnight call frequency to no more than one overnight every third day, and 10 hours off between shifts. Still, a review committee may grant exceptions for up to 10%, or a maximum of 88 hours, to individual programs. Until early 2017, duty periods for postgraduate year 1 could not exceed 16 hours per day, while postgraduate year 2 residents and in those in subsequent years can have duty periods up to a maximum of 24 hours of <b>continuous</b> <b>duty.</b> After early 2017, all years of residents may work up to 24 hour shifts. While these limits are voluntary, adherence has been mandated for the purposes of accreditation, though lack of adherence to hour restrictions is not uncommon.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyze thermal state of the traction permanent magnet synchronous motor for mine electric battery locomotive when operating in <b>continuous</b> and short-time <b>duty</b> modes. These operating modes are selected for study, as they are typical for mine electric locomotives. Methodology. Thermal calculation was performed by means of FEM in three-dimensional formulation of problem using Jmag-Designer. Results. The modeling results of thermal state of the PMSM in <b>continuous</b> and short-time <b>duty</b> operation modes showed good agreement with experimental results. The results showed that the temperature of PM is higher than temperature of the stator winding in continuous operation mode. It was found that PM temperature might reach excessive values because of the high presence of eddy current losses in neodymium PM. Therefore, special attention in the design and testing of PMSM should be paid to the temperature of PM in various operation modes. Practical value. It was recommended to use high temperature permanent magnets in traction PMSM to avoid demagnetization of PM and performance degradation...|$|R
