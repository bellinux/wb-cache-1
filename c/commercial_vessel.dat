The Manchester Vanguard and Venture, 1,662 grt, {{were designed for}} the Great Lakes service. Two larger motor vessels, the Manchester Faith and Fame, 4,460 grt, were commissioned in April 1959, and the Faith quickly became the first <b>commercial</b> <b>vessel</b> to transit the newly opened St Lawrence Seaway with its larger locks.|$|E
5|$|Two {{submarine}} tenders were {{operated by}} the KJRM, one was converted from a German-built water tanker obtained from the Austro-Hungarians, {{and the other was}} a British <b>commercial</b> <b>vessel</b> converted to the role at the time British-built submarines were acquired. The latter ship was captured by the Italians in April 1941 but survived the war to see service in the post-war Yugoslav Navy.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{naval campaign}} of 1806 was {{fought in the}} Atlantic Ocean, following a raid by two large French battle squadrons on British trade routes, focused particularly on the Caribbean. The security of the French Caribbean was under severe threat during the wars, as the Royal Navy dominated the region and restricted French movements both between the islands and between the West Indies and France itself. This dominance was enforced by rigorous blockade, in which British ships attempted {{to ensure that no}} French military or <b>commercial</b> <b>vessel</b> was able to enter or leave French harbours both in Europe and in the French colonies. In the Caribbean, this strategy was designed to destroy the economies and morale of the French West Indian territories in preparation for attack by British expeditionary forces. To counter this strategy, the French government repeatedly sent convoys and individual warships to the French Caribbean islands with supplies of food, military equipment and reinforcements. These resupply efforts ranged from small individual corvettes to large battle squadrons and were under orders to avoid conflict wherever possible. Despite these orders, many were intercepted by British blockade forces, either in the Caribbean or off the French coast itself.|$|E

25|$|Two days before, U-20 {{had sunk}} Earl of Lathom, but first allowed {{the crew to}} escape in boats. According to {{international}} maritime law, any military vessel stopping an unarmed civilian ship was required to allow those on board time to escape before sinking it. The conventions had been drawn up in a time before {{the invention of the}} submarine and took no account of the severe risk a small vessel, such as a submarine, faced if it gave up the advantage of a surprise attack. Schwieger could have allowed the crew and passengers of Lusitania to take to the boats, but he considered the danger of being rammed or fired upon by deck guns too great. Merchant ships had, in fact, been advised to steer directly at any U-boat that surfaced. A cash bonus had been offered for any that were sunk, though the advice was carefully worded so as not to amount to an order to ram. This feat would only be accomplished once during the war by a <b>commercial</b> <b>vessel</b> when in 1918 the White Star Liner RMS Olympic, sister ship to Titanic, rammed into SM U-103 in the English Channel, sinking the submarine.|$|E
