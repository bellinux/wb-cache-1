40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{equipment}} wear and operator pressure, {{as well as to}} improve the production efficiency of combined <b>continuous</b> <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> and tandem cold rolling mill units, four sections’ speeds should be automatically optimized to control the three loopers’ abundance, which include the entry loopers’ entry speed, pickling speed, trimming speed, and tandem cold rolling mill entry speed. According to the optimal speed principle, a new optimization algorithm was proposed based on objective function. In this work, Nelder–Mead simplex method is applied to find the optimal solution by minimizing the objective function. In addition, the calculation of four initial speeds is specified, especially the initial tandem cold rolling mill entry speed. The proposed speed optimization algorithm was successfully applied to a 1450 [*]mm <b>continuous</b> <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> and tandem cold rolling mill. The acceleration and deceleration are smooth and steady when welding, trimming, or roll changing takes place in practice, the three loopers’ abundance are controlled in suitable range. Results show that the <b>continuous</b> <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> unit could provide the material in maximum capacity to ensure that the tandem cold rolling mill unit’s production is efficient, and the rolling yield is greatly improved due to the {{decrease in the number of}} stops...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cast {{iron and}} steel rolls used in the <b>continuous</b> <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> must be changed {{frequently}} because the continuous acid wash equipment induces wear on the roll surface in a short period. The damage portions are usually repaired by using the flame spray coating. Recently, ceramics materials are planed to be introduced to prevent the damage because of their high abrasion and corrosion resistances. In this study new roll structure is considered where a ceramics sleeve is connected with steel shafts at both ends by shrink fitting. Here, the ceramics sleeve may provide a longer lifetime and reduces the cost for the maintenance. However, attention should {{be paid to the}} maximum tensile stresses appearing between the ceramics sleeve, spacer rings and steel shafts because the fracture toughness, plasticity and fatigue strengths of ceramics are extremely lower than the values of steel. In this study, finite element method analysis is applied to the new structure, and the maximum tensile stress and stress amplitude have been investigated with varying the dimensions of the structure. Fatigue strengths of ceramics are also considered under several geometrical conditions...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{and renewable energy}} use are two main priorities leading to industrial sustainability nowadays according to European Steel Technology Platform (ESTP). Modernization efforts {{can be done by}} industries to improve energy consumptions of the production lines. These days, steel making industrial applications are energy and emission intensive. It was estimated that over the past years, energy consumption and corresponding CO 2 generation has increased steadily reaching approximately 338. 15 parts per million in august 2010 [1]. These kinds of facts and statistics have introduced {{a lot of room for}} improvement in energy efficiency for industrial applications through modernization and use of renewable energy sources such as solar Photovoltaic Systems (PV). The purpose of this thesis work is to make a preliminary design and simulation of the solar photovoltaic system which would attempt to cover the energy demand of the initial part of the <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> hydraulic system at the SSAB steel plant. For this purpose, the energy consumptions of this hydraulic system would be studied and evaluated and a general analysis of the hydraulic and control components performance would be done which would yield a proper set of guidelines contributing towards future energy savings. The results of the energy efficiency analysis showed that the initial part of the <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> hydraulic system worked with a low efficiency of 3. 3 %. Results of general analysis showed that hydraulic accumulators of 650 liter size should be used by the initial part <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> system in combination with a one pump delivery of 100 l/min. Based on this, one PV system can deliver energy to an AC motor-pump set covering 17. 6 % of total energy and another PV system can supply a DC hydraulic pump substituting 26. 7 % of the demand. The first system used 290 m 2 area of the roof and was sized as 40 kWp, the second used 109 m 2 and was sized as 15. 2 kWp. It was concluded that the reason for the low efficiency was the oversized design of the system. Incremental modernization efforts could help to improve the hydraulic system energy {{efficiency and}} make the design of the solar photovoltaic system realistically possible. Two types of PV systems where analyzed in the thesis work. A method was found calculating the load simulation sequence based on the energy efficiency studies to help in the PV system simulations. Hydraulic accumulators integrated into the <b>pickling</b> <b>line</b> worked as energy storage when being charged by the PV system as well...|$|R

50|$|The {{location}} of the Sharon Steel Hoop Company being immediately adjacent to the Sharon Steel Company, later the Farrell Works of the Carnegie Steel Company, made it feasible for the new company to purchase its requirements of semi-finished steel from the mill located so near. When the original Sharon Steel Company was acquired later by the United States Steel Corporation, and a new contract for billets could not be negotiated, it became necessary for the Sharon Steel Hoop Company to produce its own open hearth steel. Thus, in 1902, the “Steel Hoop” inaugurated a building program which included four 35-ton open hearth furnaces, a blooming mill, and a bar mill on which billets would be rolled to be converted into bands on the 8” and 9” mills. In 1905, a fifth open hearth furnace was added, and a 10” hot strip mill was brought into production, In 1906, the company built and operated the first <b>continuous</b> <b>pickling</b> and galvanizing unit ever built in the United States.|$|R

The NB decomposition rate increased with increasing ZVI dosage level and with decreasing pH. The solution pH increased monotonously with increasing reaction duration, whereas the aniline concentration showed a maximum at 50 [*]min.
