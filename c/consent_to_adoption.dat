50|$|The Adoption of Children Act 1949 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. This {{legislation}} liberalised various rules concerning adoption.

40|$|According to Family and Guardianship Code (F. G. C.), {{adoption}} is realized {{by means of}} guardianship count decision on demand of am adopter. Unless it is otherwise provided by law, consent of specified persons is indispensable for adoption i. e. : consent of an adoptee when he turned thirteen, consent of his parents, of a guardian or an adopter's spouse if both spouses are not adopting jointly. The consent of 'the said persons as an element of adoption's effectuation {{is characterized by the}} fact that it is not creating the relationship of adoption but consists one of the premises of admissibility of deciding adoption by court. There are numerous question open to discussion related to the <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption</b> as a material premise of an adoption decision. One of those of a general impact for the whole institution of <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption</b> as well as related to the consent's positioning in a construction of adoption's realization is discussed in the article. It is a question of establishing legal character of a declaration of <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption.</b> That issue has not yet been satisfactirily clarified in the doctrine and jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Particularly, the commonly adopted treatment of the consent as a declaration of will (legal (transaction) in the understanding of Civil Code (C. C.) must raiseobjections. That view can be /traced to a psychological concept of declaration of will according to which the declaration of will means as much as manifesting an intention to cause legal consequences. The reason for doubts lies in the nature of;legal transaction an indispensable element of which is a declaration of will; the fürst is considered to be a (particular element of civil daw system provided for the legal subjects to form independently binding legal relations. Whereas no results turning into a change of previous legal situation of -the subjects are observed with making a statement of <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption.</b> Consequently it can be advocated that the institution of legal transaction (declaration of will) is not applicable in the system of adoption instituted judicially and admitted by F. G. C, for the reason of inadequacy of its function to the statutorily set role of a declaration of <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption.</b> The appraisal of a declaration of consent in the light of the newer concept of declaration of will as a normative statement instituting an individual norm of behavior is positively speaiking against considering the <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption</b> to be a declaration of will. Referring to the theory of conventional acts, which generated the aforementioned concept, it can be maintained that a sense of declaration of <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption</b> as a conventional act of legal consequence consists entirely in creating a situation in which a formerly laid down norm becomes applicable ana duties of court in a shape of an adequate reaction to that act would actualize thenselves. The results of study of the C. C. regulation of legal transactions to solve quétions related to <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption</b> prove that it is of little avail what is ia ::onsequence speaking for differentiating <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption</b> from legal transactions. The article focuses on such controvertible questions as application of C. C. provisions to the <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption</b> i. e. defects in a declaration of will, consent of -the third party, statutory representation. It can be inferred that, irrespective of its features, a déclaration of <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption</b> evades the C. C. regulation of legal transactions. The authoress advocates that upon a legai qualification of declarations of <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption,</b> one ought to refer to a type of acts in the family law, already distinguished in the doctrine and based on general premises of family law. (Particular features of family relations are taken account of in those acts as. veil as a specific regulation of acts concerning those relations including <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption</b> and departing from the civil law constructions can find its explanation there.

40|$|An {{increasingly}} {{large number}} of babies are born to unwed parents in the United States every year. This phenomenon is problematical for putative fathers in adoption proceedings because {{it is difficult to}} protect such a father’s rights while advancing the child’s best interests. Many states, such as Missouri, have responded by enacting putative father registries. An unwed father may file his intent to claim paternity with the Missouri Putative Father Registry in a postcard to insure notice of any proceeding that may affect his parental rights. However, a Missouri putative father who has not filed with the registry and taken affirmative steps to establish his paternity legally waives his right to <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption</b> in Missouri. As such, a juvenile officer’s petitioning to terminate his parental rights prior to the filing of an adoption petition is unnecessary and serves only to prolong the process. Because a putative father who has not timely availed himself of the registry and affirmatively asserted his paternity has no legal rights or obligations concerning his child, this Note argues that the juvenile officer need only to petition for a declaration that the father has no right to grant or to withhold consent to an adoption proceeding at a particular point in time. Such a policy better fulfills the legislative goals of a putative father registry and is {{in the best interests of}} the children. Expediting the adoption process in this fashion has implications not only for Missouri putative fathers, but also unwed fathers in all states that have enacted putative father registries...|$|E

Contentious issues involving the formation and recognition of same-sex families, the respect to be accorded single-parent and stepparent families, {{and the implications of}} the new reproductive technologies reprise nineteenth century attempts to manage 2 ̆ 2 artificial 2 ̆ 2 families. The early history of American adoption provides a novel and useful context to analyze the complicated relationships between 2 ̆ 2 traditional 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 alternative 2 ̆ 2 family forms. Many legal scholars ascribe the origins of modern adoption to the enactment of an 1851 statute in Massachusetts that was a radical rupture of existing law. Contrary to the claims of other scholars, I emphasize the continuity of adoption law with cultural and legal norms, showing how the law reacted to changes in family status, rather than revolutionizing the family. The article discusses how judicial interpretations of the meaning of adoption were cabined by the traditional significance of blood relationships, examining the treatment of adopted and biological children in three contexts: parental <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> <b>adoption,</b> inheritance, and the civil and criminal laws governing incest. Historical dilemmas faced by adoptees show that the law did matter to family formation and functioning, much as the law matters today for relationships at the boundary of the law, such as single parent families, cohabitants, and gay and lesbian families.

This same principle shall be the paramount consideration also when States Parties recognize and/or permit the system of adoption. Particularly, article 21 requires that States Parties [...] "ensure that the adoption of a child is authorized only by competent authorities who determine that the adoption is permissible in view of the child's status concerning parents, relatives and legal guardians and that, if required, the persons concerned have given their informed <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> the <b>adoption.</b> The placement of the child also should not result in improper financial gain for those involved in it (art. 21.d).|$|R
50|$|The {{enactment}} {{and enforcement}} of international standards and laws regulating adoption depends on how the competent authorities in each contracting state interpret international instruments and implement their provisions. European regulation and practices on the matter vary from country to country. An attempt <b>to</b> harmonize <b>adoption</b> laws among Member States of the Council of Europe was made with the European Convention on the Adoption of Children (1967), which entered into force in April 1968. In 2008 a revised version of the European Convention on the Adoption of Children was prepared by a Working Party of the Committee of Experts on Family Law {{under the authority of}} the European Committee on Legal Cooperation {{within the framework of the}} Council of Europe. The Convention was opened for signature on 27 November 2008.As of November 2013, the 1967 Convention has been ratified by 18 of the 46 Member States of the Council of Europe, while 3 Member States are signatories but have not yet ratified. As for the revised Convention, only 9 countries have signed and 7 signed and ratified.The European Convention establishes common principles that should govern adoption. The Convention establishes procedures affecting adoption and its legal consequences to reduce the difficulties in promoting the welfare of the adopted children caused by the differences in legislation and practices among the European States.Among its essential provisions, the Convention stipulates that the adoption must be granted by a competent judicial or administrative authority (art. 4), that birth parents must freely <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> the <b>adoption</b> (art.5) and that the adoption must be in the best interest of the child (art.8). Any improper financial advantages arising from the adoption of a child are prohibited (art.15).|$|R
40|$|In 2003, the Florida Legislature {{approved}} {{sweeping changes}} to Florida 2 ̆ 7 s codified Adoption Act. At {{the heart of}} these changes was the promulgation of the Florida Putative Father Registry. The 2003 Florida Adoption Act created a legal presumption that every unwed biological father in Florida had knowledge {{of the existence of}} the registry and its requirements even though the father received no actual notice. This presumption ultimately worked as a waiver of parental rights for those fathers who failed to timely register. Unwed biological fathers who registered properly preserved their right to receive actual notice of an intended adoption involving their offspring. Where an unwed biological father established compliance with the additional requirements set forth in the statute, his <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> the <b>adoption</b> would also be required. The 2003 Florida Adoption Act obligated the Florida Department of Health to publicize the Florida Putative Father Registry. Regardless of the Department 2 ̆ 7 s publicity efforts, however, unwed biological fathers were legally presumed to know and understand their legal obligations relating to the Registry requirements. While an unwed biological father was entitled <b>to</b> receive an <b>adoption</b> disclosure relating <b>to</b> an intended <b>adoption</b> of his offspring, that document did not provide any reference to the Florida Putative Father Registry. The 2003 Adoption Act raised constitutional concerns regarding the Registry because the Act failed to provide actual notice to unwed biological fathers in adoption proceedings, it eradicated all defenses for failing to register with the Registry, and it created a series of questionable legal presumptions. The Florida Supreme Court had the opportunity to address these issues in Heart of Adoptions, Inc. v. J. A. The court chose to avoid the constitutional issues implicated in the statute by reconciling the statutory language to provide actual notice of intended <b>adoptions</b> <b>to</b> putative fathers. 9 Although the court resolved the notice issue, other questions regarding the construction, application, and constitutionality of the Florida Putative Father Registry remain...|$|R
