25|$|The visual {{ability of}} {{birds of prey}} is legendary, and the keenness of their {{eyesight}} {{is due to a}} variety of factors. Raptors have large eyes for their size, 1.4 times greater than the average for birds of the same weight, and the eye is tube-shaped to produce a larger retinal image. The resolving power of an eye depends both on the optics, large eyes with large appertures suffers less from diffraction and can have larger retinal images due to a long focal length, and on the density of receptor spacing. The retina has a large number of receptors per square millimeter, which determines the degree of visual acuity. The more receptors an animal has, the higher its ability to distinguish individual objects at a distance, especially when, as in raptors, each receptor is typically attached to a single ganglion. Many raptors have foveas with far more rods and cones than the human fovea (65,000/mm2 in American kestrel, 38,000 in humans) and this provides these birds with spectacular long distance vision. It is proposed that the shape of the deep <b>central</b> <b>fovea</b> of raptors can create a telephoto optical system, increasing the size of the retinal image in the fovea and thereby increasing the spatial resolution. Behavioural studies show that some large eyed raptors (Wedge-tailed eagle, Old world vultures) and have ca 2 times higher spatial resolution than humans, but many medium and small sized raptors have comparable or lower spatial resolution.|$|E
40|$|Background: Relatively {{little is}} known about the degree of inter-specific {{variability}} in visual scanning strategies in species with laterally placed eyes (e. g., birds). This is relevant because many species detect prey while perching; therefore, head movement behavior may be an indicator of prey detection rate, a central parameter in foraging models. We studied head movement strategies in three diurnal raptors belonging to the Accipitridae and Falconidae families. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used behavioral recording of individuals under field and captive conditions to calculate the rate of two types of head movements and the interval between consecutive head movements. Cooper’s Hawks had the highest rate of regular head movements, which can facilitate tracking prey items in the visually cluttered environment they inhabit (e. g., forested habitats). On the other hand, Red-tailed Hawks showed long intervals between consecutive head movements, which is consistent with prey searching in less visually obstructed environments (e. g., open habitats) and with detecting prey movement from a distance with their <b>central</b> <b>foveae.</b> Finally, American Kestrels have the highest rates of translational head movements (vertical or frontal displacements of the head keeping the bill in the same direction), which have been associated with depth perception through motion parallax. Higher translational head movement rates may be a strategy to compensate for the reduced degree of eye movement of this species.

40|$|We have {{examined}} amacrine {{cells that are}} calretinin-immunoreactive (-IR) in the macaque monkey retina {{with the aim of}} classifying them into morphological and functional subtypes. There are calretinin-IR cells in the fovea and throughout the retina. Their highest density is reached at 1. 0 mm from the foveal pit (10, 500 cells/mm 2) and falls to 2, 600 /mm 2 by 10 mm of eccentricity. Nearest-neighbor statistics for the calretinin-IR cell body distribution indicate a nonregular pattern, with a regularity index of 1. 4 – 1. 6. There is an increase or “bump” of cell density 3. 5 – 4. 0 mm from the foveal pit, corresponding to the rod photoreceptor density peak. Based on morphological differences, there appear to be three types of amacrine cell that are calretinin-IR. To determine the types, we doubly immunolabeled retinas, from fovea to periphery, for calretinin-IR in combination with other calcium binding proteins and inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters. Labeling with parvalbumin and calretinin antibodies indicated that 70 % of the amacrine cells were solely calretinin-IR, and 30 % contained parvalbumin-IR as well. In the same way, 70 % of the calretinin-IR amacrine cells colocalized calbindin, but 30 % were only calretinin-IR. Among the calretinin/calbindin-colocalized cells, there were small-field and wide-field types. Double labeling with antibodies to calretinin and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and to calretinin and glycine revealed the majority to be glycine-IR, but some were GABA-IR. The glycine-IR population consists mainly of AII amacrine cell types, but clearly another non-AII type is involved. The non-AII glycine-IR population resembles a small- to medium-field diffuse type. The calretinin-IR wide-field type is GABAergic and corresponds to an A 19 type. The <b>central,</b> rod-free, <b>fovea</b> contains the calretinin-IR, non-AII glycine-IR type and the calretinin-IR, GABAergic type only. To learn more concerning the circuitry of the calretinin/glycine-IR, non-AII amacrine cell type in isolation from AII amacrine cells, we concentrated on the rod-free fovea, where AII amacrine cells are absent. We performed a serial section electron microscopy (EM) study on four calretinin-IR cells. They were involved with cone pathway circuitry. They got input from ON and OFF midget bipolar cells, reciprocated synapses to these bipolar cells, and provided synapses to ON-center ganglion cells. Thus we have obtained new information on a cone pathway amacrine cell of the <b>central</b> monkey <b>fovea</b> that is involved in the midget system.

All species studied have a <b>central</b> convexiclivate <b>fovea</b> (peak densities from 130, 000 to 160, 000 cells/mm²), which is shallow in the terrestrial/insectivorous yellow-rumped thornbill and deep in the arboreal/nectarivorous honeyeaters and frugivorous silvereye. Surrounding the fovea, neuronal densities in the ganglion cell layer form a broadly ovoid and asymmetric plateau in the yellow-rumped thornbill and a more restricted, circular and symmetric plateau in the other species. These differences in the plateau organization may reflect specific needs to locate food {{on the ground or}} among dense vegetation. We also found a temporal area (peak densities from 43, 000 to 54, 000 cells/mm²) across species, which increases spatial resolution in the frontal visual field and assists with foraging.

Giant ganglion cell densities also form a horizontal streak in all species, except in the yellow-rumped thornbill, which has an unusual increase toward the retinal periphery. In the yellow-rumped thornbill and silvereye, giant ganglion cells also peak in the nasal retina.

40|$|The human {{visual system}} does not treat all parts of an image equally: the central {{segments}} of an image are processed with a higher resolution than the segments that fall in the visual periphery. These different representations do not usually disrupt our perception of seamless visual space. However, a dramatic temporal/spatial distortion is perceived by observers of the dynamic visual illusion presented in this paper. The illusion accentuates differences between peripheral and central visual processing by juxtaposing global motion information (a descending disk) and local motion information (an internal spin). The temporal/spatial distortion arises when an observer shifts {{the image of the}} descending disk from foveal to peripheral vision (or vice versa).

Raptors have large eyes for their size, 1.4 times greater than the average for birds of the same weight, and the eye is tube-shaped to produce a larger retinal image. The resolving power of an eye depends both on the optics, large eyes with large appertures suffers less from diffraction and can have larger retinal images due to a long focal length, and on the density of receptor spacing. The retina has a large number of receptors per square millimeter, which determines the degree of visual acuity. The more receptors an animal has, the higher its ability to distinguish individual objects at a distance, especially when, as in raptors, each receptor is typically attached to a single ganglion. Many raptors have foveas with far more rods and cones than the human fovea (65,000/mm2 in American kestrel, 38,000 in humans) and this provides these birds with spectacular long distance vision. It is proposed that the shape of the deep <b>central</b> <b>fovea</b> of raptors can create a telephoto optical system, increasing the size of the retinal image in the fovea and thereby increasing the spatial resolution. Behavioural studies show that some large eyed raptors (Wedge-tailed eagle, Old world vultures) and have ca 2 times higher spatial resolution than humans, but many medium and small sized raptors have comparable or lower spatial resolution.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} micrangium through optical {{coherence}} tomography(OCT) in diabetic patients and {{to quantify the}} thickness of macular retia at different timing. METHODS: Control group(Group A) had 40 patients with 59 eyes, who were all diagnosed as cataract but no diabetes history. Experiment group(Group B) had 49 patients with 52 eyes, and patients were all diagnosed as Type 2 diabetes for over 2 a with cataract. All patients were examined using OCT before and after operation, including regular eye examinations. At 1 d, 1 wk and 1 mo after operations, those data were examined again, except OCT. RESULTS: Compare to patients both had cataract and diabetes, cataract patients showed a better visual acuity after operation(χ 2 = 8. 38, P = 0. 004). Thickness of <b>central</b> <b>fovea</b> of macula: for patients both had cataract and diabetes, their <b>central</b> <b>fovea</b> of macula thickened significantly in 1 wk after operation. However, for patients only had cataract, thickness of their <b>central</b> <b>fovea</b> of macula did not increase until 1 mo after operation. Thickness of strata neuro- epithelium at <b>central</b> <b>fovea</b> of macula area: for patients both had cataract and diabetes, their strata neuro- epithelium thickened in 1 d after operation. However, for patients only with cataract, it did not happen until 1 mo. Thickness of pigmentary epithelium at <b>central</b> <b>fovea</b> of macula area: for patients both had cataract and diabetes, their pigmentary epithelium thickened in 1 wk after operation. However, for patients only with cataract, {{it was not until}} 1 mo. CONCLUSION: Patients with cataract and diabetes are more likely to develop macular hydroncus after operation, and it is more serious than patients with cataract alone. Blood-retinal barrier damage is the major cause for retinal damage after phacoemulsification. Corrected visual acuity is along with the thickness of pigmentary epithelium at <b>central</b> <b>fovea</b> of macula area...|$|E
40|$|The retinae of many {{bird species}} contain a {{depression}} with high photoreceptor density {{known as the}} fovea. Many species of raptors have two foveae, a deep <b>central</b> <b>fovea</b> and a shallower temporal fovea. Birds have six types of photoreceptors: rods, active in dim light, double cones that are thought to mediate achromatic discrimination, and four types of single cones mediating color vision. To maximize visual acuity, the fovea should only contain photoreceptors contributing to high-resolution vision. Interestingly, {{it has been suggested}} that raptors might lack double cones in the fovea. We used transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to evaluate this claim in five raptor species: the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), the honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), the Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), the red kite (Milvus milvus), and the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). We found that all species, except the Eurasian sparrowhawk, lack double cones in the center of the <b>central</b> <b>fovea.</b> The size of the double cone-free zone differed between species. Only the common buzzard had a double cone-free zone in the temporal fovea. In three species, we examined opsin expression in the <b>central</b> <b>fovea</b> and found evidence that rod opsin positive cells were absent and violet-sensitive cone and green-sensitive cone opsin positive cells were present. We conclude that not only double cones, but also single cones may contribute to high-resolution vision in birds, and that raptors may in fact possess high-resolution tetrachromatic vision in the <b>central</b> <b>fovea...</b>|$|E
40|$|A foveal {{image sensor}} {{integrated}} circuit comprising {{a plurality of}} CMOS active pixel sensors arranged both within and about a <b>central</b> <b>fovea</b> region of the chip. The pixels in the <b>central</b> <b>fovea</b> region have a smaller size than the pixels arranged in peripheral rings about the central region. A new photocharge normalization scheme and associated circuitry normalizes the output signals from the different size pixels in the array. The pixels are assembled into a multi-resolution rectilinear foveal image sensor chip using a novel access scheme {{to reduce the number}} of analog RAM cells needed. Localized spatial resolution declines monotonically with offset from the imager's optical axis, analogous to biological foveal vision...|$|E
30|$|Additionally, if the {{subtending}} angle by {{the signal}} {{is such that}} its image occupies {{a part of the}} fovea or the <b>central</b> <b>fovea,</b> the emission of each led will affect a small number of photoreceptor cells and therefore the glare effect will be more severe. This solid angle of maximum visual acuity varies between 54 ' and 1.2 ° (Bardier 2001). The image of a 300  mm diameter traffic light (the biggest standardized traffic signal) observed from the front, subtend a 1 ° angle from 17  m, so the image occupies all the <b>central</b> <b>fovea.</b> That is why glare could be severe for observation distances shorter than this.|$|E
40|$|Birds {{with larger}} eyes are {{predicted}} {{to have higher}} spatial resolution because of their larger retinal image. Raptors are well known for their acute vision, mediated by their deep <b>central</b> <b>fovea.</b> Because foraging strategies may demand specific visual adaptations, eye size and fovea may differ between species with different foraging ecology. We tested whether predators (actively hunting mobile prey) and carrion eaters (eating dead prey) from the order Accipitriformes differ in eye size, foveal depth, and retinal thickness using spectral domain optical coherence tomography and comparative phylogenetic methods. We found that (1) all studied predators (except one) had a central and a temporal fovea, but all carrion eaters had only the central fovea; (2) eye size scaled with body mass both in predators and carrion eaters; (3) predators had larger eyes relative to body mass and a thicker retina {{at the edge of}} the fovea than carrion eaters, but there was no difference in the depth of the <b>central</b> <b>fovea</b> between the groups. Finally, we found that (4) larger eyes generally had a deeper <b>central</b> <b>fovea.</b> These results suggest that the visual system of raptors within the order Accipitriformes may be highly adapted to the foraging strategy, except for the foveal depth, which seems mostly dependent upon the eye size...|$|E
