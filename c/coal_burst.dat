40|$|Sudden {{and dynamic}} failure of rock/coal mass during mining {{is a serious}} threat to safety in {{underground}} mines. This failure {{is often referred to as}} ‘rockbursts’ or ‘coal bursts’, mainly attributable to high level of stress. In order to investigate the <b>coal</b> <b>burst</b> phenomenon, a series of laboratory tests were conducted to examine the failure patterns associated with a burst event. Optical glass cube samples were drilled under varying stress conditions, to investigate the influence of stress environment on the dynamic failure. The outcomes of these laboratory tests will improve the understanding of the loading mechanisms leading to <b>coal</b> <b>burst,</b> especially the influence of high stress environment...|$|E
30|$|Underground {{observations}} and monitoring are critical {{components of a}} burst risk management program. Mining crews should be trained to observe <b>coal</b> <b>burst</b> warning signs, particularly the occurrence of small bursts, which are often the best indication that an area is becoming more burst prone. A record-keeping system should be maintained, and management processes developed to ensure that warning signs receive appropriate responses.|$|E

While <b>coal</b> <b>bursts</b> cannot be predicted in advance, the risk can be estimated through careful evaluation of those factors known {{to be associated with}} <b>coal</b> <b>bursts.</b> Understanding the different characteristics of <b>coal</b> <b>bursts</b> in specific coalfields is also critical to the risk evaluation.|$|R
60|$|The {{result was}} that a column of almost solid smoke, which had been for some time rising thicker and thicker from the <b>coals,</b> <b>burst</b> into a bright flame. This {{was the first of}} the sweet {{influences}} before referred to.|$|R
30|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>bursts</b> {{involve the}} sudden, violent {{ejection}} of coal or rock into the mine workings. They are a particular hazard because they typically occur without warning. During the past 2  years three US coal miners {{were killed in}} two <b>coal</b> <b>bursts,</b> following a 6 -year period during which there were zero burst fatalities. This paper puts the US experience {{in the context of}} worldwide research into <b>coal</b> <b>bursts.</b> It focuses on two major longwall mining coalfields which have struggled with bursts for decades. The Utah experience displays many of the “classic” burst characteristics, including deep cover, strong roof and floor rock, and a direct association between bursts and mining activity. In Colorado, the longwalls of the North Fork Valley (NFV) also work at great depth, but their roof and floor strengths are moderate, and most bursts have occurred during entry development or in headgates, bleeders, or other outby locations. The NFV bursts also {{are more likely to be}} associated with geologic structures and large magnitude seismic events. The paper provides a detailed case history to illustrate the experience in each of these coalfields. The paper closes with a brief discussion of how US longwalls have managed the burst risk.|$|R
40|$|Random {{kinetic energy}} induced from strain energy stored in mining {{structures}} can distribute the stresses in rock masses. This physical transformation from potential to kinetic energy {{can lead to}} a severe <b>coal</b> <b>burst</b> which can be highly damaging. An efficient tool that can evaluate this stress distribution can {{play an important role in}} the design and planning of coal pillars and mine layouts. This paper presents a novel three-dimensional finite element modelling methodology (3 D FEM) that has been developed to determine the structural response of a pillar subjected to kinetic energy release. This methodology can be used to determine the areas where a pillar is susceptible to violent, uncontrolled failure as well as to study the structural responses of a coal pillar. As part of the study a parametric study of combination of softening parameters in both coal and coal/rock interface was conducted to determine critical regions in the pillars that may lead to a better design strategy in <b>coal</b> <b>burst</b> prone mines...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} seismic events that {{occurred}} within the New South Wales (NSW) mining regions in the past 10 years, using the seismic data obtained from Geoscience Australia. The frequency and magnitude of the seismic events were assessed to investigate the correlation between underground mining activities and the associated seismicity. The study also reviewed the seismic events associated with coal bursts in Australia to understand its nature and its proneness in Australian conditions. Based on the study conducted, {{there is no clear}} correlation between the past recorded seismic events and the underground coal mining activities. It is also suggested that the <b>coal</b> <b>burst</b> in Australia appears in low energy magnitude, occurring in isolated manner. In comparison to international experience, coal mines in China and United States have encountered significantly higher frequency and magnitude seismic events associated with <b>coal</b> <b>burst.</b> Based on the findings, it is recommended that localised seismic monitoring methods should be used to monitor low magnitude events with higher accuracy in regards to depth and location of events. The analysis and results produced from this study contribute to the knowledge and understanding of mining induced seismicity in Australian underground coal mines...|$|E
30|$|A major <b>coal</b> <b>burst</b> {{occurred}} when the panel had been retreated 225  m. The shearer had just begun the double-cut at the tailgate that began the return pass towards the headgate. Approximately 30  m of the face blew out, propelling coal across the conveyor and into the shields, and causing fatal injuries to the shearer operator. Floor, roof, and rib damage from the burst was also visible for 45  m along the tailgate entry. This event registered M =  2.2 on the regional seismic network (UUUS 2014).|$|E
30|$|The first <b>coal</b> <b>bursts</b> were {{recorded}} in Utah almost 100  years ago. They were typically associated with pillar recovery under deep cover.

30|$|While <b>coal</b> <b>bursts</b> have {{occurred}} in several different coalfields in central and western Colorado, {{in recent years the}} problems have focused on operations in the North Fork Valley (NFV) of the Gunnison River.

The area that collapsed at Crandall Canyon was enormous, encompassing 20 rows of pillars over approximately one square kilometer.

40|$|The {{possible}} mining seismicity (MS) and its prediction {{are important}} for safety and recovery optimization of mining in steep-heavy-thick rock mass condition. The stress-lever-rotation-effect (SLRE) model of fault-like mobilization was proposed preliminarily. Some innovation monitoring technique approaches for mining seismicity assessment were successfully fulfilled at Wudong Mine of Urumchi Coalfield, China. The characteristics on acoustic-seismic-wave index indicated the spatial-temporal-strength and stress redistribution of steeply deeper-heavy thick coal and rock masses. Applications in field investigations showed that the innovation monitoring (in time and space) of these instruments could provide important information about the performance of mining disturbed structures (heading and steep pillar) during caving of competent overlying roof strata. The prediction and evaluation for mining seismicity were applicable and valid. Operating practice showed that mining efficiency was raised and conspicuous economic benefit was obtained. This approach provides essential data for assessing mining seismicity, <b>coal</b> <b>burst,</b> dynamic hazard prevention, and deep mining potential...|$|E
30|$|It {{is evident}} that {{a wide range of}} causes can result in coal bursts. The volume of coal {{involved}} in bursts also covers a wide spectrum, from a few chunks of coal up to a whole array of pillars. The common link between all these events appears to be the failure mechanism of the coal itself. In general, coal is able to carry high vertical stress (or more precisely, maximum principal stress (sigma 1)) only when it also carries large confining stresses (or minimum principal stress (sigma 3)). If the vertical load is increased under these conditions, failure usually takes the form of non-violent yielding. A <b>coal</b> <b>burst,</b> on the other hand, apparently results when the confining stress is suddenly reduced. Research by Babcock and Bickel (1984) indicated that a wide variety of coals can be induced to fail violently by this “loss of confinement” mechanism. The loss of confinement can either be the result of mining activity, or of the ground shaking that accompanies an off-seam seismic energy release (a mining-induced earthquake).|$|E
30|$|As {{long ago}} as the early 1930 s, <b>coal</b> <b>bursts</b> were {{classified}} into two types according to their apparent cause (Rice 1935). “Pressure bursts” were thought to originate in the seam itself and were associated with high stress and direct mining activity. Typical pressure bursts occur while a continuous miner is extracting a pillar or a longwall shearer is cutting the tailgate corner of the face.|$|R
30|$|The {{long history}} of <b>coal</b> <b>bursts</b> in the US has been well-documented. Iannacchione and Zelanko (1995) {{analyzed}} a database of 172 bursts that had occurred between 1936 and 1993. These bursts had resulted {{in a total of}} 87 fatalities and 163 injuries. Reflecting the mining technology in use during this period, 61  % of the events occurred during pillar recovery operations, and 25  % during longwall mining. The remaining 14  % occurred during development.|$|R

40|$|The Velenje {{coal mine}} (VCM) is {{situated}} on the largest Slovenian coal deposit {{and in one of}} the thickest layers of coal known in the world. The thickness of the coal layer causes problems for the efficiency of extraction, since the majority of mining operations is within the coal layer. The selected longwall coal mining method with specific geometry, increasing depth of excavations, changes in stress state and naturally given geomechanical properties of rocks induce seismic events. Induced seismic events can be caused by caving processes, blasting or bursts of coal or the surrounding rock. For 2. 5 D visualization, data of excavations, ash content and calorific value of coal samples, hanging wall and footwall occurrence, subsidence of the surface and <b>coal</b> <b>burst</b> source locations were collected. Data and interpolation methods available in software package Surfer® 12 were statistically analyzed and a Kriging (KRG) interpolation method was chosen.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} and longstanding engineering problems associated with coal mining is the catastrophic failure phenomenon known as coal mine bursts (known in the United States as bumps). For more than 70 years, researchers and practitioners have attempted to determine whether this destruction observed underground is caused by stress conditions within the coal pillar or from distant seismic sources in the mine roof and floor strata. The role of confinement and the extent of failure in solid pillars and panels have also proven difficult to define. These are important issues, since control solutions need to be based on a fundamental understanding of the problem. Obsenations by U. S. Bureau of Mines researchers over the last decade have helped to clarify certain aspects of these issues. Microseismic sensors and geomechanic field measurements have located areas of excess energy release, identified stress conditions in coalbeds close to failure, and recorded the response of mine structures prone to bursts. In the present study, data available for a range of U. S. bursts were considered in an effort to evaluate both common and distinctive features. Although the attempt revealed little commonality, encouraging results were produced by categorizing coal bursts by source mechanisms. When a <b>coal</b> <b>burst</b> is thus categorized, differences in environmental factors-such as geology, stress fields, and mining methods-are highlighted, and viable control strategies are readily recognized...|$|E
40|$|Coal mining (especially underground) is {{considered}} one of the most hazardous industries, and as a result considerable focus is applied to eliminating or mitigating hazards through careful mine planning, equipment selection and certification, and development of management systems and procedures. Regulatory agencies have developed in-house methods for reporting, classification and tracking of fatalities and other incidents according to the type of event, often including consideration of different hazard types. Unfortunately, direct comparison of mining safety statistics between countries is confounded by considerable differences in the way that individual countries classify specific fatalities or incidents. This paper presents a comparative analysis of coal mining fatality data in Australia, South Africa, India, China and the United States from 2006 to 2010. Individual classification definitions are compared between the five countries, and methods presented to normalise each country’s hazard definitions and reporting regimes around the RISKGATE framework of seventeen different priority unwanted events (or topics). Fatality data from individual countries is then re-classified according to the different RISKGATE topics, thereby enabling a comparative analysis between all five countries. This paper demonstrates the utility and value of a standard classification approach, and submits the RISKGATE framework as a model for classification that could be applied globally in coal mining. RISKGATE is the largest health and safety project ever funded by the Australian coal industry ([URL] to build an industry body of knowledge to assist in managing common industry hazards. A comprehensive knowledge base has been captured for risk management of tyres, collisions, fires, isolation, strata underground, ground control open cut, explosions, explosives, manual tasks and slips/trips/falls. This has been extended to outburst, <b>coal</b> <b>burst</b> and bumps, interface displays and controls, tailings dams and inrush...|$|E
40|$|As {{more easily}} mined {{deposits}} are depleted, the reserves {{are becoming more}} limited and less favorable. Deposits of coal or trona that are being longwall mined are deep and are getting deeper. <b>Coal</b> <b>bursts</b> and bumps frequently occur within development entries in longwall mining of deep mines due to high stresses. This paper presents a novel patented longwall mining layout “Longwall Mining with Split-level Gate roads (LMSG) ” {{that has the potential}} to mitigate several problems related to deep mining (Patent No. ZL 98100544. 6). LMSG locates gate roads on either end of a longwall panel at different vertical heights within a coal seam or in a geologically split seam, so that the two adjacent panels can be partially offset horizontally. It is novel in that it incorporates unit operations of different mining methods into the system. By employing multiple slice longwall mining method locally at the face ends, and adjacent panels overlapping end to end, pillar-less longwall mining can be achieved to mine deep deposits. A conventional rectangular gate road pillar is therefore transformed into a small triangular pillar and the gate road of the subsequent panel can be located along or under the gob of the previously mined panel where the stresses are lower. Several mines in China and Russia are currently using the technology with reduced incidence of ground control problems. Through theoretical analysis, and physical and numerical modeling approaches, it is demonstrated that LMSG significantly improves stress environment for development entries, with associated reduction in <b>coal</b> <b>bursts</b> and ground control problems...|$|R
30|$|Managing {{the risk}} of <b>coal</b> <b>bursts</b> begins with an {{evaluation}} of the factors that increase the likelihood of bursts. These include the depth of cover, the presence of past mining above or below, the roof and floor geology, and the presence of faults and other geologic factors. A past history of bursts {{is one of the most}} powerful indicators of burst risk during any type of mining. Major bursts have often been preceded by smaller ones. Often these “precursors” have occurred at the same stage in the mining process as the subsequent large event (for example, in the same location on the longwall face). Also, once a mine has experienced bursts, later situations with similar geology and mining methods should also be considered high risk.|$|R

30|$|One {{factor that}} {{does not seem to}} be {{strongly}} correlated with bump proneness is the character of the coal. Iannacchione and Zelanko (1995) noted that bursts have occurred in at least 25 different US coalbeds, varying from strong, blocky seams to very friable ones like the Pocahontas No. 3 and No. 4. Extensive German laboratory studies using large-scale specimens have also concluded that nearly all bituminous <b>coals</b> can <b>burst.</b> In these experiments, coal seams ranging in unconfined, compressive strength from 5  MPa to 50  MPa have all been shown to be burst-prone (Bräuner 1994).|$|R

The laboratory observations of EMR effects of <b>coal</b> samples <b>bursting</b> failure and in situ investigations {{in the process}} of roof caving are presented in this paper. EMR peak with increasing stress is discussed when the failure of coal samples happens, which provides an explanation to EMR signals positively correlated well with the stress loaded. The linearly increasing relation is also found between EMR intensity and the uniaxial compressive strength, and EMR maximum amplitudes and pulses behave a logarithmic accretion tendency with bursting energy indexes of coal.

40|$|One of {{the more}} {{pressing}} engineering problems for deep longwall mines in the Southern Appalachian Basin is to design longwall systems that will eliminate catastrophic coal pillar failure from the working environment.

Because the 24. 4 - 111 (80 -ft) square abutment study pillar is within the pillar size commonly used in this region, understanding the behavior of this pillar should aid in future efforts to design optimum mining strategies. This research has attempted to construct the pillar stress and roof-to-floor convergence profiles in order to evaluate the ultimate strength, deformation modulus, visco-elastic deformation, and violent failure characteristics of the pillar during longwall mining.

40|$|AbstractThe {{observations}} {{developed in}} this paper are intended to provide researchers and mining engineers with initial estimate of the <b>burst</b> risk of <b>coal</b> pillar, as the study of bursting liability is of importance in forecasting and preventing the bump of <b>coal</b> pillar. <b>Bursting</b> Energy Index (WCF) is selected in this study to describe the influence of roadway backfill on bursting liability and strength of coal pillar. For the general study undertaken {{in this paper}}, a formula derived from the combined South African and Australian databases was {{used to analyze the}} <b>bursting</b> liability of <b>coal</b> pillar. Based on over 60 numerical models of various pillar height and backfill percentage, a series of average axial stress-strain curve of 5 ∼ 10 m coal pillar with roadway backfill is attained. Modelling results suggest that the pillar strength will increase with increasing roadway backfill. It also can be seen that the Bursting Energy Index (WCF) will decrease with increasing roadway backfill while the percentage of decrease amount of WCF will increase versus the percentage of roadway backfill. The increase in pillar strength is greater for the tall pillars than squat pillars. It is also observed that the central portion of coal pillar defined as elastic pillar core plays a significant role on loading capacity of pillars, increasing coal pillar strength and decreasing Bursting Energy Index (WCF) ...|$|R
30|$|High {{dynamic stress}} (σ_d). During shallow mining, the coal-rock mass around roadways and coalfaces {{presents}} low original stress. However, {{due to the}} high energy released by far-field mine tremor, the dynamic stress converted from the tremor source to the coal mass show high instantaneous increment. Thus, the total stress may also exceed the critical stress level of dynamic failure. Therefore, coal masses develop sudden dynamic failure. In addition, researches (He 2013) prove that, coal rocks exhibit higher burst tendency under high loading rate than that under normal state. Moreover, the coal rocks that are originally identified as no burst tendency may also show burst failure given high loading rate or dynamic load. Here, the instantaneous dynamic disturbance of mine tremor plays a dominant role in the burst failure process. This is why the rockburst may also be observed in the shallow mining process or the <b>coal</b> rocks without <b>burst</b> tendency originally identified.|$|R
