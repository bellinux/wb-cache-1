50|$|As the {{probability}} of default is higher when debt is higher, there exists a level of lending that maximises expected return to the lender, and so the <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling</b> will depend on {{the probability}} of default.

This setting is reminiscent of Stiglitz and Weiss, as the interest rate has an incentive effect, and does not play the standard allocational role prices are supposed to play.

The seminal contribution is by Jonathan Eaton and Mark Gersovitz, who consider a simple model of international lending for a small open economy.

Countries face a penalty if they default, and whenever they are supposed to make debt payments, they consider whether they would be better off by defaulting, paying the penalty, and be forever barred from international credit markets, or pay the debt installment, borrowing again, and making the same decision next period.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine whether}} credit {{contributes}} to business cycle fluctuations by directly affecting consumption {{rather than through}} the now well-understood investment channel. Examining UK data we argue that consumers face a rising interest rate schedule whereby additional borrowing leads to higher interest rates. At {{a certain level of}} debt this schedule may become vertical and consumers face a <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Using this assumption we find consumption growth depends on the interest rate, the borrowing wedge, and the debt-income ratio, and that we can potentially account for the failings of the rational expectations permanent income hypothesis (REPIH). Risk aversion and the interest rate schedule interact such that agents choose not to hold much debt, however, and so consumers are not much affected by ‘credit crunches’, although the more efficient the capital market, the bigger the impact. Calibrating our model and performing simulations suggests the sharp increases in UK consumption in the late 1980 s were more likely due to income revisions than financial deregulation per se.

We consider an economy producing exportable and importable goods. The economy is liberalized, and tariffs are eliminated. The public views the reform credibility as questionable, and expects the possibility of future policy reversal. The policy maker sets policies and public investment as to maximize the expected utility of a risk averse representative agent. We identify the need to tax private investment in the importable sector, and to subsidize private investment in the outward-oriented sector. We show that the signaling effect of public investment nay generate a positive externality for public investment in the outward sector, and a negative externality for public investment in the inward-oriented activity. We demonstrate that the elimination of sectorial private investment policies call for {{a rise in the}} public/private capital ratio in the outward-oriented activities, and a drop in that ratio in the inward-oriented activities. In the presence of an external <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling,</b> a higher degree of risk aversion increases the magnitude (without changing the nature) of the policies. ...|$|R

40|$|Private {{investors have}} an {{important}} role toplay in the ongoing process of reform in Eastern Europe. So external creditworthiness is crucial to a successful transition. Large government borrowing crowds out the formation of private contracts between international investors and domestic entrepreneurs and firms. Given the overall <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling</b> in international lending, the public sector needs to curtail its external borrowing to leave room for the private sector. This also implies that public debt reduction may be especially desirable in the highly indebted countries of Eastern Europe. Rather than flood the public sector with new loans, international organizations should attempt to improve domestic creditworthiness by supporting debt reduction and borrowing restraints during the transition period. Debt for equity swaps represent an attractive vehicle for debt reduction in the highly indebted countries of Eastern Europe. Such schemes, when tied to the privatization effort, are not inflationary. They simply represent a swap of public liabilities, and they create value to the extent that foreign private investment leads to positive externalities. The challenge will be to create swap mechanisms that will allow the Eastern European countries to retain a large share of those gains.

40|$|This paper models {{a dynamic}} {{bargaining}} game between a highly indebted {{country and its}} commercial bank consortium, to analyze the determinants of the resulting re-scheduling agreements and the net transfer of resources over time. The bargaining game {{is based on the}} simple paradigm that if no agreement is reached for a current payment, the banks would apply default sanctions. The author found that under general conditions settlements would be reached and default sanctions would not be applied in equilibrium. But the default sanctions would be a credible threat underlying the negotiations and determining the equilibrium payments. These equilibrium payments in turn would determine the <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling</b> and the later commercial discounts on the debt market. Unlike other bargaining games, this one explicitly models the debtor country's economic structure, featuring an import-dependent economy subject to foreign exchange and fiscal constraints. Moreover, the model is truly dynamic {{in the sense that the}} future negotiating environment is endogenously determined by current bargaining outcomes. Under plausible refinements and assumptions, the author obtains a closed-form solution for net transfers, dependent on various structural and policy parameters.

40|$|Previous {{approaches}} to credit {{policy in the}} stabilization and adjustment of developing countries have emphasized either {{the role of the}} availability of credit or the role of its price - that is, the interest rate. The authors argue that effective credit policy in developing countries must take into account both interest rate and credit channels. The authors develop their argument {{in the context of the}} link between credit policy and private investment, using a model of firms'investment behavior in an economy with exogenous, time-varying borrowing constraints. The model incorporates a <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling</b> linked to the firms'net worth and the state of the credit market. The state of the credit market depends on factors such as credit and interest rate policy, regulatory and supervisory practices, and market sentiments that banks consider in making lending decisions. These factors affect banks'decisions independent of a borrower's creditworthiness. Thus, in times of tight money, firms that would otherwise have received loans may be denied them and have to postpone or cut back investment plans. The authors use their model to specify an equation relating aggregate private investment to aggregate output and to two credit market variables. Their findings show that interest rates and credit volume exert a joint influence on the behavior of private investment in the countries examined.

The paper sets out an analytical framework, based on a particular formalization of the government intertemporal budget constraint, which justifies the measures of seigniorage and implicit taxation that are computed for the period 1980 - 1990.

40|$|As {{economic}} reforms are mutually interdependent, a liberal policy package needs internal coherence. How can a coherent reform strategy be achieved for a well-balanced and functional economic system? In this paper, we analyze {{the relationship between}} financial reforms coherence and international capital inflows (foreign direct investments (FDI) and portfolio investments). We consider a package of eight financial reforms, comprising interest rate deregulation, <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling</b> and directed-credit programs liberalization, elimination of banking sector entry barriers, privatization of state owed banks, development of security markets and banking sector supervision measures. Complementarity is measured through the reciprocal of the Herfindahl-Hirschman concentration index. The {{results suggest that the}} manner with which financial reforms are implemented matters. Particularly, complementarity increases FDI inflows by 0. 10 %. Moreover, this effect depends on the location of the countries on the distribution of financial reforms level. Indeed, the countries located above the median value of financial reform level experience larger FDI and portfolio investment inflows than others. Finally, when privatization of state owned banks and the adoption of a capital adequacy ratio based on the Basle I standard occur after other preliminary financial reforms, the returns to complementarity are higher. In others words, a developed and relatively safe domestic financial system attracts more FDI and portfolio investments than a developed but unsafe financial system. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract When {{we accept}} money and its {{functions}} in the Islamic economic framework, the same as all other economic systems, we should consider monetary policy as an important available tool for governments to pursuit macroeconomic objectives. But the problem is that, in the conventional economic system, the interest rate plays a critical role for executing monetary policy while in the Islamic economic framework, interest rate is forbidden according to Shariah rules {{and we are not}} allowed to use interest based instruments for monetary policy. The dominant view between Islamic scholars is that, since interest based instruments like open market operation is forbidden in Islamic economics, hear, we should only use monetary aggregate instruments like <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling</b> for executing monetary policy. But in reality, many Islamic countries do not restrict theirselves to only monetary aggregate instruments; instead, they use widely profit rate instruments like Musharakah certificates as a substitute for interest based instruments. What we discuss in this paper is the explanation for this gap between theory and practice in the monetary policy of Islamic economic system. Comparing interest based instruments and monetary aggregate instruments from economic point of view shows that, when we use interest based instruments, there is more macroeconomic stability in goods and money markets after executing monetary policy. This advantage of interest based instruments over monetary aggregate instruments has made monetary officials of Islamic countries like Islamic republic of Iran, use extensively profit rate instruments like Musharakah certificates for executing monetary policy. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{patterns}} of optimal tax rates and borrowing {{in the presence of}} endogenous borrowing constraints differ considerably from the patterns observed with fully integrated capital markets. We study a developing country characterized by a costly tax collection. Its access to the international credit market is determined by the efficiency of the tax system and the relative bargaining power of creditors. Partial defaults induce a `burden shifting' from bad to good states of nature, reducing the cost of borrowing, implying that a switch from no default to a partial default regime is associated with a borrowing boom. The switch to a partial default regime is associated with financial fragility, where small adverse changes in fundamentals lead to a large accumulation of debt. The tax rate exhibits strong counter-cyclical patterns in economies operating at the <b>credit</b> <b>ceiling,</b> whereas the tax rate exhibits strong pro-cyclical patterns in economies operating on the upward sloping portion of the supply of credit, where the risk premium is positive, and very little cyclical patterns in economies operating on the elastic portion of the supply of credit. We identify a volatility- debt curve for a given realization of output. With low debt, higher volatility tends to reduce borrowing. When volatility reaches a threshold, we observe a switch from a no default to a partial default regime, where a further rise in volatility increases borrowing and reduces present taxes. ...|$|R
