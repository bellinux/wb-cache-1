They can cause damage to trees by tearing the bark and eating the soft <b>cambial</b> tissue underneath. In Europe, sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) suffer the greatest damage.|$|E
25|$|The name “Adirondack” is an Iroquois word {{which means}} tree-eater and {{referred}} to their neighbors (more {{commonly known as the}} Algonquians) who collected the inner bark of this tree, Picea rubens, and others during times of winter starvation. The white soft inner bark (<b>cambial</b> layer) was carefully separated from the hard, dark brown bark and dried. When pounded this product can be used as flour or added to stretch other starchy products.|$|E
25|$|Instead, {{correlations}} can be {{made between}} the number of extant gymnosperms and angiosperms. It is likely that cycad diversity was affected more by the great angiosperm radiation in the mid-Cretaceous than by extinctions. Very slow <b>cambial</b> growth was first used to define cycads, and because of this characteristic the group could not compete with the rapidly growing, relatively short-lived angiosperms, which now number over 250,000species, compared to the 1080remaining gymnosperms. It is surprising that the cycads are still extant, having been faced with extreme competition and five major extinctions. The ability of cycads to survive in relatively dry environments where plant diversity is generally lower, may explain their long persistence and longevity.|$|E
2500|$|Larvae are {{cylindrical}} and elongate {{and can be}} [...] {{long and}} [...] wide. Larvae first create a feeding gallery in the <b>cambial</b> region, but more mature larvae tunnel to the heartwood as they feed. Larvae go through at least five instars over 12 years; which can vary due to host or temperature conditions. Larvae expel frass from their tunnels near the original oviposition site. A larva can consume up to 1,000 cubic cm of wood in its lifetime. Asian long-horned beetle larvae do not pupate before they reach a critical weight, so additional larval instars can occur.|$|E
50|$|The {{phytohormones}} {{that are}} involved in the vascular <b>cambial</b> activity are auxins, ethylene, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid and more to be discovered. Each one of these plant hormones are vital for the regulation of the <b>cambial</b> activity and are dependent on their concentration.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Pinus monticola. They bore {{under the}} bark in the <b>cambial</b> layer of their host plant. They prefer to attack wounds in the bark.|$|E
50|$|The stem {{presents}} nodes unilacunar (with one trace), {{with internal}} phloem absent, secondary thickening developing from a conventional <b>cambial</b> ring, xylem with tracheids; The sieve-tube plastids are S-type.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{formerly}} known as the [...] "Monetary and Foreign Exchange Authority of Macao" [...] (Autoridade Monetaria e <b>Cambial</b> de Macau, abbr. as AMCM), which was created on July 1, 1989.|$|E
50|$|Propagating through {{cuttings}} {{is another}} form of vegetative propagation that initiates root or shoot production from secondary meristematic <b>cambial</b> cells. This explains why basal 'wounding' of shoot-borne cuttings often aids root formation.|$|E
50|$|In {{an earlier}} technique, potted {{seedlings}} {{were placed in}} a freezer chest and cooled to some level for some specific duration; {{a few days after}} removal, seedlings were assessed for damage using various criteria, including odour, general visual appearance, and examination of <b>cambial</b> tissue (Ritchie 1982).|$|E
50|$|Auxin hormones {{are proven}} to stimulate mitoses, cell {{production}} and regulate interfascicular and fascicular cambium. Applying auxin {{to the surface}} of a tree stump allowed decapitated shoots to continue secondary growth. The absence of auxin hormones will have a detrimental effect on a plant. It has been shown that mutants without auxin will exhibit increased spacing between the interfascicular cambiums and reduced growth of the vascular bundles. The mutant plant will therefore experience a decreased in water, nutrients, and photosynthates being transported throughout the plant, eventually leading to death. Auxin also regulates the two types of cell in the vascular cambium, ray and fusiform initials. Regulation of these initials ensures the connection and communication between xylem and phloem is maintained for the translocation of nourishment and sugars are safely being stored as an energy resource. Ethylene levels are high in plants with an active <b>cambial</b> zone and are still currently being studied. Gibberellin stimulates the <b>cambial</b> cell division and also regulates differentiation of the xylem tissues, with no effect on the rate of phloem differentiation. Differentiation is an essential process that changes these tissues into a more specialized type, leading to an important role in maintaining the life form of a plant. In poplar trees, high concentrations of gibberellin is positively correlated to an increase of <b>cambial</b> cell division and an increase of auxin in the <b>cambial</b> stem cells. Gibberellin is also responsible for the expansion of xylem through a signal traveling from the shoot to the root. Cytokinin hormone is known to regulate the rate of the cell division instead of the direction of cell differentiation. A study demonstrated that the mutants are found to have a reduction in stem and root growth but the secondary vascular pattern of the vascular bundles were not affected with a treatment of cytokinin.|$|E
50|$|Reaction wood in a {{woody plant}} is wood that forms {{in place of}} normal wood as a {{response}} to gravity, where the <b>cambial</b> cells are oriented other than vertically. It is typically found on branches and leaning stems. It is an example of self optimisation and the axiom of uniform stress in trees.|$|E
50|$|PBZ {{is used by}} arborists {{to reduce}} shoot growth and {{has been shown to}} have {{additional}} positive effects on trees and shrubs. Among those are improved resistance to drought stress, darker green leaves, higher resistance against fungi and bacteria, and enhanced development of roots. <b>Cambial</b> growth, as well as shoot growth, {{has been shown to be}} reduced in some tree species.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, {{researchers}} from the Plant Stem Cell Institute (formerly Unhwa Institute of Science and Technology) presented their data to the world via Nature Biotechnology. Their research demonstrated the world's first <b>cambial</b> meristematic cell isolation. Due to the valuable and beneficial compounds for human health (i.e. paclitaxel) which are secreted by the CMC's, this technology is considered a serious breakthrough in plant biotechnology.|$|E
50|$|Trees {{growing in}} wet ground or in deep layers of humus are most {{susceptible}} to attack. Characteristically, tunnels in the root collar region {{are filled with}} pitch, with larvae feeding on the <b>cambial</b> or inner bark region. Small trees are often girdled and killed. Feeding damage on larger trees permits wood rots {{to enter into the}} wounds, the trees becoming susceptible to wind breakage.|$|E
50|$|The {{vascular}} cambium is maintained by {{a network of}} interacting signal feedback loops. Currently, both hormones and short peptides {{have been identified as}} information carriers in these systems. While similar regulation occurs in other meristems of plants, the <b>cambial</b> meristem receives signals from both the xylem and phloem sides for the meristem. Signals received from outside the meristem act to down regulate internal factors, which promotes cell proliferation, and promotes differentiation.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Ribes grossularia, Ribes nigrum and Ribes sativum. They mine {{under the}} bark in the <b>cambial</b> {{cylinder}} of both new spring shoots and canes {{from the previous}} seasons growth. The mine is a slender, linear tunnel that normally curves at both upper and lower ends to form a narrow ellipse. When the larva completes a circle, it normally reinvades the initial mine and continues feeding and enlarging it.|$|E

50|$|Oak wilt is a fungal {{caused by}} Ceratocystis fagacearum, {{is a disease}} {{originating}} in eastern Russia. It can slowly or quickly kill an oak tree when the tree reacts to the fungus by plugging its own <b>cambial</b> tissue while attempting to block {{the spread of the}} fungus. This plug prevents the cambium vascular tissue from delivering nutrients and water {{to the rest of the}} plant, which eventually kills it. Red oaks are very susceptible.|$|E

5000|$|CLV3/ESR-related ('CLE') peptide family — CLV3 encodes a small {{secreted}} peptide that {{functions as}} a short range ligand to the membrane-bound CLV1 receptor like kinase that together with CLV2 (a receptor-like protein) function to maintain stem cell homeostasis in Arabidopsis shoot apical meristems. Although the maize embryo-surrounding region protein (ESR). [...] and CLV3 are very different, they are both members of the CLE peptide family given that they share a short conserved 14-amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminal region. To date, more than 150 CLE signaling peptides are identified. This proteolytically processed bioactive region is important for both promoting and inhibiting cellular differentiation in both apical and <b>cambial</b> meristems.|$|E
5000|$|H. occidentale can be {{detected}} in stands due to lower crown height of affected trees in a stand. Infection weakens the roots and will travel up to 15 m up the heartwood affecting wood quality and yield. [...] The weakened roots will increase the chance of windthrow, {{which can be used}} to identify diseased sites. The hosts of H. occidentale tend to have increased butt and sapwood decay then H. irregulare hosts which suffer from <b>cambial</b> and sapwood necrosis. [...] Affected trees can be hard to identify as older trees tend to show gradual symptoms such as decreased leader growth, abnormally short twigs or needles, as well as decreased root systems.|$|E

50|$|The larvae feed {{on common}} lilac, green ash, poplar, aspen, cottonwood and {{trembling}} aspen. It is a pest of poplar and willow and commonly feeds in hybrid poplar stool beds. They live in tunnels in the <b>cambial</b> area (bark-wood interface) {{of both the}} lower stem and roots of their host plant. The species requires two years to complete its life cycle, overwintering as a larva twice. Pupation occurs in silk-lined, wood chip pupal chambers in the soil if larvae have fed in host tree roots. They pupate just below the bark surface if they have fed in the stem. Depending on their location, pupae move {{to the surface of}} either soil or bark before emerging as adult moths in late June or early July.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the early}} twentieth century, the {{anthophyte}} hypothesis was the prevailing explanation for seed plant evolution, based on shared morphological characters between the gnetophytes and angiosperms. In this hypothesis, the gnetophytes, along with the extinct order Bennettitales, are sister to the angiosperms, forming the [...] "anthophytes". [...] Some morphological characters that were suggested to unite the anthophytes include vessels in wood, net-veined leaves (in Gnetum only), lignin chemistry, the layering of cells in the apical meristem, pollen and megaspore features (including thin megaspore wall), short <b>cambial</b> initials, and lignin syringal groups. However, most genetic studies have rejected the anthophyte hypothesis. Several of these {{studies have suggested that}} the gnetophytes and angiosperms have independently derived characters, including flower-like reproductive structures and tracheid vessel elements, that appear shared but are actually the result of parallel evolution.|$|E
5000|$|Cambium {{is a type}} of {{meristem}} {{with thin}} walls which minutely exist in small populations within a plant. Due to this structural characteristic, once physical force is applied to it, it is easily damaged in the very process of isolation, losing its stem cell characteristics. Despite 160 years of biological effort to isolate and retrieve plant stem cells, none succeeded in the isolation due to the distinct structural characteristics of plant stem cell: [...] "the cambium consists of a few layers of narrow elongated, thin-walled cells, easily damaged during sampling." [...] This highly vulnerable feature has made studies on <b>cambial</b> structure and ultrastructure difficult to achieve with conventional methods. Thus failure to isolate plant stem cells from meristematic tissues prompted scientists to administer plant cell culture by using callus (dedifferentiated cells) as an alternative to plant stem cells.|$|E
5000|$|Botryosphaeria corticola [...] {{has caused}} {{infection}} of oak trees in Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Italy, Greece, Hungary, [...] and the United States. Bot canker of oak kills trees in natural forests {{as well as}} in cork plantations. The cork industry in Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, and Morocco has been dealing with declining oaks for several years from biotic and abiotic factors. [...] This disease has been seen in many cork plantations and is the most important contributor to the decline in the cork industry.When cork is harvested from the trees, the cork cambium is exposed creating a wound for the fungus to enter the trunk, and cause disease. Infection of other oaks is most likely through wounds, also. These wounds may be natural wounds, but there is evidence insect damage is involved, especially in coast live oak in California. [...] Botryosphaeria corticola infects the twigs, branches and stems of oaks and degrades the <b>cambial</b> tissues. With the degradation of vascular tissues the trees display wilting and dieback symptoms.|$|E
50|$|In 1919, Hacman {{became a}} {{professor}} at the Cernăuți law faculty, and in this capacity laid the foundations for a commercial studies academy in 1920.

5000|$|In {{places such}} as Kerala where {{coconuts}} are in abundance, the half shell of coconut {{was used as the}} latex collection container. Glazed pottery or aluminium or plastic cups became more common in Kerala and other countries. The cups are supported by a wire that encircles the tree. This wire incorporates a spring so it can stretch as the tree grows. The latex is led into the cup by a galvanised [...] "spout" [...] knocked into the bark. Tapping normally takes place early in the morning, when the internal pressure of the tree is highest. A good tapper can tap a tree every 20 seconds on a standard half-spiral system, and a common daily [...] "task" [...] size is between 450 and 650 trees. Trees are usually tapped on alternate or third days, although many variations in timing, length and number of cuts are used. The latex, which contains 30-40% dry rubber, is in the bark, so the tapper must avoid cutting right through to the wood, else the growing <b>cambial</b> layer is damaged and the renewing bark becomes deformed, making later tapping difficult. It is usual to tap a pannel at least twice, sometimes three times, during the tree's life. The economic life of the tree depends on how well the tapping is carried out, as the critical factor is bark consumption. A standard in Malaysia for alternate daily tapping is 25 cm (vertical) bark consumption per year. The latex-containing tubes in the bark ascend in a spiral to the right. For this reason, tapping cuts usually ascend to the left to cut more tubes.|$|E
40|$|Effects of low {{temperature}} on <b>cambial</b> cells induced by localized heating in Cryptomeria japonica and Abies firma were investigated during winter dormancy in January-February. Localized heating induced <b>cambial</b> reactivation in the stems earlier than natural <b>cambial</b> reactivation. In heated Cryptomeria japonica and Abies firma stems, <b>cambial</b> reactivation occurred after 6 and 2 days of heating, on 14 January 2007 and 15 January 2010, respectively. We stopped the electric heating system just after <b>cambial</b> reactivation in stems. When we stopped the heating system, the minimum atmospheric temperature was about 0 C. After <b>cambial</b> reactivation, due to rapid decrease in temperature, cell contents of cambium became coagulated but nucleus {{was present in}} ray <b>cambial</b> cells. After one month, the shrunk cambium produced new deformed tracheids with abnormal cell shape. The results suggest that rapid decrease in temperature just after <b>cambial</b> reactivation might induce temporary damage of cambium that produces deformed tracheids indicating that cambium and its derivatives can response directly to changes in temperature which provides a useful experimental model system for studies of <b>cambial</b> biology and xylogenesis...|$|E

40|$|The commonest {{approach}} to studying <b>cambial</b> productivity is conventional light microscopy, which {{is widely used}} in wood formation studies. The number of such studies has increased rapidly in the past decade, usually in order to elucidate the relationship between growth and environmental factors. However, some aspects of <b>cambial</b> seasonality are often overlooked or neglected. Observations with transmission electron microscopy provide a more detailed insight into changes occurring on the ultra-structural level in <b>cambial</b> cells. Criteria for defining <b>cambial</b> activity are not yet fully clarified, especially when observing it at different resolutions, i. e., on cellular, subcellular and ultrastructural levels. The goal of this review is to contribute to clarification of the terms mainly used, such as <b>cambial</b> dormancy, reactivation, activity, productivity and transition between different states, resting period and quiescence, which describe structural modifications of <b>cambial</b> cells during the various phases of their seasonal cycle. Based on our own cambium observations on adult beech trees growing at two different elevations, which were made with light and transmission electron microscopy, we discuss the influence of weather conditions on <b>cambial</b> activity and {{the advantage of the}} complementary use of different techniques and resolutions...|$|E
