40|$|ABSTRACT: Clays {{from the}} Ae and <b>C</b> <b>horizons</b> of five Podzol soil series in New Brunswick were {{examined}} by X-ray, chemical and infrared absorption methods. ALl the experimental evidence {{indicated that the}} Ae horizons contained predominantly a dioctahedral randomly interstrafified mica-vermiculite [...] smectlte clay, whereas the <b>C</b> <b>horizons</b> contained abundant dioctahedral mica (illite) and trioctahedral chlorite. Since no trace of chlorite as a separate phase or as one component of the interstratified structure {{was found in the}} Ae horizons, it was concluded that, while the inherited chlorite was decomposed in all of the Ae horizons, mica was differentially hydrated giving an interstratified structure. Fourier transforms of the three-component i erstratified clay revealed ifferent ratios of hydrated layers (vermiculite and smectite) to non-hydrated layers and different stacking sequences. The proportion of hydrated layers and randomness of stacking was related to the degree of weathering as measured by the accumula-tion of TiO 2 in the Ae horizon and it was suggested that they {{may be related to the}} degree of podzolization...|$|R

Soil samples were collected from top-slope, mid-slope and bottom slope positions at horizon-A, B and C. Results showed a significant difference among the physico-chemical properties of top, mid and bottom slope soils.

Conversely, electrical conductivity EC- 2. 47 dS m- 1), phosphorus (3. 40 mg kg- 1), Potassium (118. 8 mg kg- 1), Organic matter content (1. 52 %), clay content (20. 39 %) and silt content (49. 17 %) were the highest at bottom slope followed by mid and top-slopes, respectively. Soil A, B and <b>C</b> <b>horizons</b> were also significantly (p< 0. 05) different in their physico-chemical properties.

Factors influencing DOC in peat waters are: (1) peat thermal regime, (2) water chemistry, and (3) water table position.

The Ae horizon clays of these soils contained mainly interstratified mica-vermiculite-montmorillonite wher as the <b>C</b> <b>horizon</b> clays contained mica of a more discrete nature.

However, in the samples from each of these soils except in those of the most weathered one, the K exchange rate of the interstratified mica from the Ae horizon was {{higher than that of}} the less weathered, more discrete mica from the corresponding <b>C</b> <b>horizon.</b> The abundance of hydrated edges and layers exposing K exchange sites in the Ae horizon micas probably contributed to their higher ates of K exchange. Amounts of K fixed in the Ae horizon clays were not related to degrees of weathering.

At the same time, CEC is an input parameter of many computer models being applied in soil science and agriculture. Methods of CEC determination are always time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, developing a model for CEC estimation from other soil properties is essential. The objective of this study was to understand the associations between CEC (as a dependent variable) and sand, silt, clay, organic matter and pH (as independent variables). In this study 464 soil samples from A, B, and <b>C</b> <b>horizons</b> of different soils were used.

No significant correlation was observed between CEC and pH. Stepwise regression analysis showed that both organic matter and clay enter the model and that coefficients of determination (r 2) for the multiple models are higher than those of simple linear correlations.

The present study assessed the effects of different land use types (arable, forest, grassland) on soil microbial biomass, activity and community structure at different soil depths (A, AC, C horizons), under the same climatic and pedological conditions, in the Danube Floodplain in Austria. Microbial biomass was 4 – 5 times lower in the arable field than in forest and grassland in the upper horizons. Additionally, both microbial biomass and activity decreased 3 – 4 fold with soil depth in forest and grassland. However, up to 30 % of total microbial biomass was found in the <b>C</b> <b>horizon</b> in the arable field. We found a differentiation of microbial community structure between land use types and with soil depth: i. e. strong differences in the topsoil between land uses, whereas community structure in the <b>C</b> <b>horizon</b> was similar.

The aim of which was to investigate mineralogical evolution and element mobilization and redistribution during weathering under dry tropical climate. The weathering profile consists of four main horizons: (1) a spheroidal weathering zone constituted by a corestone shell complex, (2) a <b>C</b> <b>horizon,</b> (3) a Bw horizon and an Ah horizon. The results indicate that nontronite, a Fe-rich smectite, is the exclusive clay mineral formed in the exfoliated shells and the <b>C</b> <b>horizon.</b> It is associated with kaolinite in the upper horizons. The coexistence of these two clay minerals induced a decrease of CEC and pH which becomes neutral. The weathering index (WI) values reveal that weathering {{becomes more and more}} intensive from the corestone up to Bw horizon, which is the most weathered horizon in the weathering profile. Mass balance calculations, using Th as immobile element, indicate that Ti is quite mobile and that Al and Fe are relatively enriched at the bottom and strongly leached {{at the top of the}} profile. Alkalis and alkaline earth elements are strong leached through out the profile, except Ca which displays similar trend as Al and Fe. The same goes for LILE (Cs, Sr),TTE (Cr, Co, Ni) and HSFE (Y, Nb, Hf). In opposite, REE are depleted at the bottom and enriched in the upper horizons, with more enrichment for LREE than for HREE. It appears that weathering of greenstone belt causes a fractionation of HREE and induces a concentration of LREEs. Ce and Eu anomalies display opposite behaviour. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

Soil pen-etration estimates of soil thickness were similar to seismic estimates for shallow soils (< 50 cm depth) but were poorly related on deeper soils.

30|$|Special soil {{handling}} {{requirements are}} applied when mining operations occur on prime farmland. Prime farmlands are areas with soils that meet specific criteria and are highly productive for agriculture. If prime farmland {{is to be}} disturbed by mining, special SMCRA requirements apply (Dunker and Barnhisel 2000). Such areas must be identified in the mining permit by soil surveys or agricultural agencies, and a plan to restore the agricultural use and productivity for such areas is required. The restoration plan must include reclamation practices to restore “equivalent or higher levels of yield as non-mined prime farmland in the surrounding area.” The restoration plan must also describe segregation, storage (if necessary), and replacement of individual soil horizons (A, B, and <b>C</b> <b>horizons)</b> from the prime farmland area. Restoration of productivity is required within 10  years after soil replacement.|$|R
