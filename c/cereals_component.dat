40|$|A {{method that}} {{has been shown to}} be {{effective}} for removing pollutant heavy metals from water systems is the process of adsorption. Adsorption involves the addition of a particulate colloidal substrate to the aqueous system containing the metal ions, and this can reduce the pH at which the metal ions can be removed from solution compared to precipitation processes. In this study, a commercially available bacterial adsorbent, which consists of pure cultured bacteria on a cereal support, was studied for its potential as a heavy metal adsorbent. The pH-dependent adsorptive properties of Zn(II), Ni(II) and Cr(III), three metals often found in waste water streams, were measured using this adsorbent. As a comparison, the removal profiles were also determined using the <b>cereal</b> support <b>component</b> of the adsorbent alone, without the bacterial component.

40|$|In the Satake Centre for Grain Process Engineering we are {{developing}} cereal-based biorefining {{strategies for the}} production of biofuels, biodegradable plastics and platform chemicals. Cereal grains are complex biological entities and we target the exploitation of all <b>cereal</b> <b>components</b> providing both value-added end-products and precursors for chemical synthesis. Hydrolysis of natural polymers (e. g. starch, protein) contained in cereals requires supply of a range of hydrolytic enzymes (e. g. amylase, protease), which are produced by fungal bioconversions. On-site production of these enzymes would result in the production of a high amount of fungal biomass. Fungal autolysis can be used to bioconvert this low-cost byproduct into a nutrient-rich supplement (fungal extract) for microbial bioconversions. Mixing fungal extracts with cereal hydrolysates results in nutrient-complete microbial feedstocks. Optimising the exploitation of protein in cereal grains would enable the provision of optimum amounts of free amino acids and peptides to subsequent microbial bioconversions and the extraction of the remaining protein as a value-added co-product with various current (food) and potential (biodegradable plastics) market outlets. The use of amino acids and peptides would enhance productivities (e. g. polyhydroxybutyrate, succinic acid) and, in certain cases, production yields (e. g. polyhydroxybutyrate) improving significantly current fermentation practices that exploit only the starch <b>component</b> in <b>cereal</b> grains.

While early studies relied on crude indicators of celiac toxicity, the advent of jejunal biopsy and sophisticated immunohistochemical techniques has allowed accurate studies to be performed. Studies to determine {{the nature of the}} <b>cereal</b> <b>component</b> that is toxic to patients with celiac disease have concentrated on wheat because of its nutritional importance. A number of in vitro studies indicated the presence of one or more celiac-activating epitopes with the N-terminus of the A-gliadin molecule. In vivo challenge with three synthetic peptides subsequently indicated the toxicity of a peptide corresponding to amino acids 31 to 49 of A-gliadin. In vivo gluten challenge is the gold standard for the assessment of celiac toxicity; however, jejunal biopsy is a relatively invasive procedure, thus, other methods have been investigated. Direct infusion of the rectum with gluten has been shown to result in an increase in mucosal intraepithelial lymphocytes, occurring only in celiac patients.

The importance of tiny amounts of gliadin in the diet, such as that which occurs in wheat starch, has been studied by in vivo challenge; this technique has clarified the position of oats in the gluten-free diet. Several studies suggest that this cereal may be included in the diet of most adult celiac patients.

40|$|In the {{decision}} to establish solid fodder resources in the arid parts of Southern Russia triticale should take its rightful place. It must be introduced instead of winter wheat, inferior to the yield, quality and output of nutrients per unit of area. It is necessary to maximize the potential of new varieties of winter triticale, as the productivity of animals largely depends on the varietal characteristics of the culture. Triticale has attracted special attention by its ability to exceed the parental forms on productivity and quality, and resistance to adverse soil and climatic conditions and the most dangerous disease is not inferior to rye. The generalized data of most researchers characterize triticale {{as a factor in}} increasing the productivity of animals and reducing the cost of feed per unit of output, although in some cases there is a negative trend in reduction of productivity by the replacement of <b>cereal</b> grain <b>components</b> for winter triticale. Due to the enrichment of compound feed with triticale grain by enzyme preparations and enzyme-probiotic supplements we can greatly increase productivity, digestibility of main nutrients, improve meat quality and reduce the cost of feed per unit of output. We can increase the productive effect of triticale grain by extrusion. In physiological metabolic experiments, it is found that by extruding of triticale grain the digestibility of the main nutrients is increased by 1. 3 - 1. 8 %. Extruding of triticale before feeding promotes slaughter yield and increases the levels of protein in the muscle. The use of triticale in rations instead of wheat reduces the cost of the diet, the cost of the manufactured products and increases profitability.

40|$|Sorghum is an {{important}} grain globally and can be grown in areas of low rainfall and high summer temperatures. Most Australian sorghum is grown in northern New South Wales and Queensland. It is used extensively by the Australian poultry industry and if wheat prices are high it can constitute 100 % of the <b>cereal</b> grain <b>component</b> of broiler diets. However, poultry industry nutritionists have observed that broilers fed sorghum based diets have reduced and variable performance compared to their counterparts fed wheat based diets. Subsequent studies have confirmed these industry concerns and shown that broilers on sorghum based diets have depressed feed efficiency and variable breast meat yield It is now generally considered that variable amounts of phytate, kafirin and possibly polyphenols in the sorghum grain may act as anti-nutritional factors impairing nutrient utilization and bird performance. In an attempt to unravel the role of anti-nutritive factors in the variable response of broilers fed sorghum, different feed enzymes and their combinations were added to a bioassay diet containing only sorghum. This approach was adopted to eliminate the confounding effects of other feed ingredients and {{the aim of this}} thesis was to examine the role of anti-nutritive factors (specifically phytate and kafirin) in reducing the available nutrient content of sorghum for broilers.

In adsorption processes, a colloidal substrate is added {{in order to reduce the}} pH at which the ions can be removed compared to, for example, direct hydroxide precipitation. Adsorption of heavy metals has been performed using a wide range of experimental conditions, employing a variety of substrates [1 - 4]. In particular, metal oxides have been studied extensively, and some oxides have been shown to exhibit a greater affinity for some metals over others [3. 5]. Carbonaceous substrates have also been used [4, 6] with the high levels of adsorptive properties being attributed to the presence of carboxylate surface functionality. More recently, biological substrates have been shown to be efficient in the removal of heavy metals [7 - 9]. The advantages associated with the use of biological substrates for this purpose are that they can be produced relatively inexpensively, are renewable, remove metals efficiently, and in some cases show high selectivity for certain metal types [7]. For bacteria, the substrate surface sites onto which metal adsorption takes place includes hydroxyl, carboxyl and phosphate groups. Whilst it has been shown that the presence of carboxyl (in addition to hydroxyl) surface functionality assists and enhances the metal ion adsorption process [4], it is unclear as to the role that the other surface sites play in the adsorption processes. It is also unclear as to the extent to which these surface sites contribute to the removal of aqueous metal ions from solution.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{structure}} of production in organic farming in the South Bohemia Region. It is divided into research, which includes agriculture and livestock components of organic farming and the practical part, where are the evaluated data obtained from databases ÚZEI, MA and the internal structure of the Faculty of Agriculture, specifically the Department of agro-ecosystems. The part of the research is divided into five main chapters. The introductory chapter describes the history of organic farming. The chapter Changes in {{the structure of}} agriculture, depictes conventional agriculture and an important evenst for the development of agriculture in the territory of the Czech Republic. The following chapter Specifications crop and livestock production enters up the main principles of organic farming. The next chapter describes the non-productive functions of agriculture, as soil protection, against erosion, etc. The search ends with the chapter titled The current structure, which depictes the current state of agriculture. In the practical part the structure of crop and livestock production in the South Bohemia and in the Czech republic. Region was investigated, which is subject of chapter five. It was being watched with the most common representation of animals, where in South Bohemia and the Czech Republic in organic farming predominates - cattle breeding suckler and sheep. In chapter five, is also disclosed the amount of produced milk and manufactured milk products. There was found representation of major crops and their individual income in the plant <b>component,</b> <b>cereals</b> dominate in South Bohemia and the Czech Republic. The work also focused on the representation of arable land and permanent grassland in South Bohemia and the Czech Republic. The practical part compares the data for South Bohemia with the data for the whole Czech Republic (eg. The percentage of plants on the entire arable land etc.) ...|$|R

The <b>components</b> are: a particulate heater, medium and grain mixer, separation unit and aeration unit. Comparative tests showed that {{particulate medium}} heating was 5 times faster and 87 % more efficient than convective heating. Although the drying efficiency was 95 % higher in the convection system, the overall use of input energy was 28 % higher in the Processor. Drying of corn was investigated at 500 kg/h. High moisture removal was achieved at initial moisture contents of 19 % and 24 % using salt at initial medium temperature of 250 ºC. The highest moisture removal achieved was 6. 17 % (w. b.) with a corn flow rate of 500 kg/h, initial moisture content of 19 %, initial medium temperature of 250 °C, and a 60 s contact time. Soybean was roasted in the Processor at 500 kg/h. Initial medium temperatures of 175, 200 and 250 °C resulted in grain temperatures of 104, 107 and 127 °C, respectively, for a contact time of 60 s. An average of 4. 11 % (w. b.) moisture reduction was achieved from commercially dried soybean at 6. 8 % initial moisture content. A preliminary study showed grain temperatures over 67 °C was sufficient to achieve 100 % insect mortality of Sitophilus granarius for a 30 s exposure. These temperature and contact time data were used for evaluating the possibility of thermal disinfestation using the Processor. Tests on wheat processed at 1000 kg/h showed that grain temperatures rose to between 69. 8 °C and 72. 9 °C for exposure times of 60 s. These results were achieved at thermal efficiencies of 43 % and 49 % respectively. Estimated cost of disinfestation using the machine was CAN$ 0. 385 /t. Seed quality wheat was processed to determine parameters leading to total thermal de-germination. Tests were conducted at 40, 60, 80 and 100 °C. Total de-germination of the wheat seed was found to occur at temperatures over 80 °C for an exposure time of 60 s...|$|R
40|$|To {{overcome}} the `post-weaning growth check' commonly seen at weaning, {{the incorporation of}} antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) to the diet has been a useful management tool. Recent legislation within the European Union banning the use of AGPs at sub-therapeutic levels in animal feed means {{that the quality of}} dietary ingredients used in weaner diets has assumed a much more fundamental role. In order to improve the availability of starch in the piglet diet, processing of cereals is widely practised. However, descriptions of processing techniques used in many studies are simply referred to by name, with no regard of the precise variables used. In addition, many of the feed materials are simply referred to as `cooked' which gives little indication of nutritional value. Five trials were conducted in order to assess the use of raw and processed <b>cereals</b> on diet <b>component</b> digestion, digesta properties and gut morphology in newly-weaned piglets. The main objective was to examine the use of precisely controlled processing variables, such that starch digestibility was maximised with benefits for the gastrointestinal environment. A second aspect of the programme of work reported was the application of a number of analytical tests commonly used in the field of human food science, to examine the physicochemical properties of starch granules, and the changes they undergo upon processing. Using this approach, a comparison could be made between in-vitro (rheological) results and in-vivo (biological) responses. Trials 1 and 2 examined variability between raw cereals. Wheat, barley, rye and triticale were assessed in Trial 1. Wheat (identical batch), naked oats, whole oats and maize were evaluated in Trial 2. Coefficients of apparent digestibility (CAD) for starch and nitrogen revealed considerable variation between the cereals. In Trial 1, there was a strong trend (P = 0. 051) for starch digestion to be highest for the rye diet and lowest for triticale. CAD for starch was not significantly affected by cereal type in Trial 2. Despite having more viscous intestinal digesta than other animals (P = < 0. 001), pigs fed the rye-based diet did not experience any detrimental effects to animal performance. Trial 3 examined the use of raw wheat, of either hard or soft endosperm texture. From 5 days post-weaning, piglets fed the soft wheat diet had a tendency (P = 0. 063) to have higher feed intakes. In addition, pigs fed soft wheat diets had significantly less viscous tract digesta (P = 0. 029) than those animals fed the diet based on hard wheat. There {{was no significant difference in}} CAD for starch between the two dietary treatments but CAD for nitrogen was found to be significantly higher (P = 0. 006) in the distal region of the small intestine for pigs fed the soft wheat diet. The results from Trial 3 suggest that endosperm texture of wheat can have an effect on nutritional value, and that wheat of soft endosperm texture is more beneficial than hard wheat for the young piglet. Trial 4 was a 2 x 2 factorial study examining wheat endosperm texture (hard vs. soft) and degree of micronisation (high cook vs. low cook). CAD for starch was not affected by endosperm texture, although degree of cook was an important factor with significantly higher starch digestion for the high cook diets, compared to low cook (P = 0. 047). The use of micronised wheat lessened the reduction in starch digestibility seen on day 4 post-weaning in the small intestine, compared against the decline seen using raw wheat diets in Trial 3. In summary, Trial 4 demonstrated that micronisation can enhance the nutritional value of wheat for the weaned piglet, with degree of cook, a more significant factor than wheat endosperm texture. Trial 5 assessed wheat endosperm texture (hard vs. soft) and degree of extrusion (high cook vs. low cook). Raw soft wheat was used as a control. Results showed that CAD for starch in the small intestine was noticeably higher than in the other animal trials. Starch digestion was significantly affected by endosperm texture (greater coefficients for soft than hard; P < 0. 001) and by degree of cook (high SME greater than low SME; P < 0. 001). The use of extruded wheat diets almost eliminated the drop in starch digestion at the 0. 5 intestinal site seen on day 4 post-weaning. Wheat of soft endosperm texture responded better to extrusion processing than hard wheat under the conditions of Trial 5. The use of computer modelling was able to demonstrate a correlation between in-vitro starch parameters and in-vivo starch digestion in the small intestine of the piglet.

40|$|Background: In {{an effort}} to reduce the {{prevalence}} of protein-energy malnutrition among Ghanaian infants after the period of exclusive breastfeeding when complementary food (CF) is introduced, Weanimix, which is a blend of non-dehulled maize, groundnut and non-dehulled soyabean/cowpea, was introduced in Ghana, in 1987 through collaboration between the Nutrition Division, Ministry of Health, Ghana and the United Nations Children’s Fund. Weanimix is an improvement over traditional maize-, millet-, or sorghum-only porridge in protein and energy densities, but it is high in phytate. Phytate limits the bioavailability of nutrients such as iron and zinc, and probably calcium and some proteins. Also, unless fortified, Weanimix is low in β-carotene (vitamin A precursor) as the white maize is the commonly consumed variety in Ghana. Additionally, cereal-based CF (example, Weanimix) forms a very thick porridge that requires dilution with water to get the desirable viscosity, leading to “energy and nutrient thinning” (that is, the reduction of energy and nutrient densities). Thus, the widely used unfortified cereal-based CF could be a major contributing factor to the persistently high occurrence of vitamin A, iron and zinc deficiencies among infants in sub-Sahara Africa. Purpose: The main focus {{of this study was to}} develop a CF using locally accessible ingredients in Ghana that will be low in phytate, contain measurable levels of β-carotene and forms a low viscous porridge, which could be produced at home or industrially. Method: A computer-assisted programme (Nutrition Calculator) obtained from Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition- Infant and Young Child Nutrition Programme was used to formulate composite flours containing sweetpotato, soyabean and fish powder from anchovies or skim milk powder to meet the protein, fat and energy specifications in the Codex standards (CAC/GL 8 and STAN 074 - 1981, Rev. 1 - 2006) for CF. The household-level ComFa formulation with fish powder as an ingredient was toasted in an oven and denoted oven-toasted ComFa, while the industrial-level formulations (roller-dried ComFa and extrusion-cooked ComFa) had skim milk powder (a common ingredient in industrial-processed dry infant <b>cereal)</b> as a <b>component</b> and were produced using a roller drier or an extruder. The nutritional, functional and consumer acceptance analyses of sweetpotato-based CFs were carried out and compared with enriched Weanimix. In this research, Weanimix was slightly modified by using dehulled maize and soyabean flours, and further addition of 17 % fish powder and 0. 50 % sugar to the basic formulation, and referred to as enriched Weanimix. Additionally, the stability of β-carotene in the oven-toasted ComFa was evaluated under simulated average temperature of 32 °C and 85 % relative humidity, mimicking the ambient conditions of Ghana. Results: The ComFa formulations and the enriched Weanimix met the stipulated energy and fat values specified in the Codex standards. However, the protein content of the industrial ComFa formulations was lower by 17 %, but the oven-toasted ComFa and enriched Weanimix met the protein specification. The sweetpotato-based formulations had total dietary fibre that was about twice the Codex specification of less than 5. 0 %, but was likely to be partly soluble fibre and, thus beneficial. The phytate content in all the ComFa formulations was approximately a quarter of the level of 0. 80 g/ 100 g in the enriched Weanimix. Only the sweetpotato-based infant foods contained measurable levels of β-carotene, resulting in significantly higher vitamin A content of the oven-toasted ComFa compared with enriched Weanimix (28. 80 vs. 1. 20 μg retinol equivalents/ 100 kcal). Most of the β-carotene in the oven-toasted ComFa was retained for up to eight weeks when stored in containers with a good moisture barrier under simulated ambient conditions of Ghana. Oven-toasted ComFa, roller-dried ComFa and enriched Weanimix, using an estimated daily ration of 40 g (dry weight), contained less than half of the World Health Organization recommended levels for calcium (400 mg/day), iron (9. 3 mg/day) and zinc (4. 1 mg/day) from CFs processed for 6 to 8 month-old breastfeeding infants, with the exception of the oven-toasted ComFa, which contained 60 % of the recommended calcium level. The two selected ComFa formulations are likely to be less inhibitory regarding calcium, iron and zinc absorption by infants than the enriched Weanimix based on the phytate: calcium, iron and zinc molar ratios, and the level of β-carotene to predict relative availability of these essential minerals. All the CFs had phytate: calcium molar ratios lower than the maximum recommended ratio of 0. 17, but their phytate: iron molar ratios exceeded the maximum recommended ratio of 1. 0. However, the phytate: zinc molar ratio of the oven-toasted ComFa and roller-dried ComFa were approximately lower by 24 % than the recommended ratio of 15. In contrast, the phytate: zinc ratio of enriched Weanimix was higher by 53 % compared to the recommended ratio. Also, the ComFa formulations and enriched Weanimix, had levels of total polyphenols (84. 70 and 76. 96 mg/meal, respectively), which may inhibit iron absorption. On average, sweetpotato-based formulations were higher in maltose (26 times), sucrose (5 times), free glucose (19 times) and fructose (7 times) than levels in enriched Weanimix, but the ComFa formulations contained significantly less starch (10 - 13 vs. 47 g/ 100 g). The high simple sugar and low starch levels in the ComFa formulations could explain the lower apparent viscosity (9 -, 13 - and 20 -times, for peak, “consume” and final viscosities), higher water solubility index (7 times), and higher consumer acceptance compared with the maize-based formulation. Conclusion: On the basis of the compositional, functional and sensory findings of this study, the sweetpotato-based formulations have significant advantages as complementary food compared with Weanimix due to the low level of phytate, the high levels of endogenous β-carotene and low viscosity. Importantly, the ingredients used to produce the household-level ComFa formulation could be easily accessed by caregivers in Ghana. However, there is a need to conduct field trial and consumer acceptance studies in Ghana before substantive recommendations on the use of the sweetpotato-based infant formulation could be made. Limitation: The conclusions made are based on compositional, functional and consumer acceptance studies but not on any in vivo experiment or randomised feeding trial among Ghanaian infants. However, because the comparisons were made between the ComFa formulations and Weanimix, the conclusions drawn in this thesis are relevant...|$|R
