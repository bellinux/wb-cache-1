5|$|The {{daylight}} hours of 28 July saw <b>continuous</b> <b>fire</b> from the Pashtun sharpshooters {{established in the}} hills surrounding Malakand South. The garrison surgeon, Lieutenant J.H. Hugo, treated a number of British casualties including an officer from the Guides. Despite further attacks during the night of July 28/29, the British recorded only two killed from the sepoy ranks, and the severe wounding of a Lieutenant Ford. Churchill records that Ford's bleeding artery was clamped shut by Hugo despite being under fire.|$|E
5|$|The Shenandoah {{destroyed}} {{one more}} prize in the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, then continued to the Aleutians {{and into the}} Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean, crossing the Arctic Circle on June 19. Continuing then south {{along the coast of}} Alaska the Shenandoah came upon a fleet of Union ships whaling on June 22. She opened <b>continuous</b> <b>fire,</b> destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell took aim at a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American whaling fleet while in Arctic waters.|$|E
5|$|After Martin's death, the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry {{began to}} buckle as {{increasing}} numbers of North Korean troops flooded into Chonan from the Northwest and eastern roads. The battalion suffered heavy casualties, but was saved by the <b>continuous</b> <b>fire</b> laid down by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion. Between 0800 and 1000, U.S. units began a disorganized retreat from the town, many soldiers deserting their units and running from the battle. Wadlington, now {{in command of the}} 34th Infantry, moved 3rd Battalion to a collecting point south of the town, where 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry was holding a blocking position and had not been engaged. As 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry began to pull back to rally points, 1st Battalion began to come under mortar fire from North Korean forces, but withdrew without engaging them.|$|E
40|$|A game-theoretic {{model is}} {{proposed}} for the generalization of a discrete-fire silent duel to a silent duel with <b>continuous</b> <b>firing.</b> This zero-sum two-person game is solved in the symmetric case. It is shown that pure optimal strategies exist and hence also solve a noisy duel with <b>continuous</b> <b>firing.</b> A solution for the general nonsymmetric duel is conjectured. ...|$|R
50|$|A fusillade is the {{simultaneous}} and <b>continuous</b> <b>firing</b> {{of a group}} of firearms on command. It stems from the French word fusil, meaning firearm, and fusiller meaning to shoot.|$|R

5|$|Ethalion {{took over}} pursuit of Bellone from Melampus, {{and for two}} hours {{maintained}} <b>continuous</b> <b>fire</b> with her bow-chasers on the French ship. Ethalion was faster than her quarry, and she slowly pulled parallel with Bellone during the afternoon, but could not get close enough for a decisive blow. It took another two hours of pursuit before the battered Bellone eventually surrendered. Hoche apart, Bellone had suffered more casualties than any other ship present. To the south of this conflict, the struggling Anson discovered herself in danger when the surviving frigates of the French vanguard swept towards her en masse. Captain Durham was initially confused by their approach {{as he had been}} too distant to witness the action and the French ships flew false British ensigns, but he rapidly realised their true identity and at 16:00 opened fire on Loire. The damaged Anson was severely hampered by her inability to manoeuvre, and so could do nothing when the French ships pulled back and sailed away, except to continue to fire until they were out of range. During the evening, the surviving French frigates gradually pulled away from their pursuers and disappeared into the gathering night, leaving behind four of their squadron, including their flagship, as captives.|$|E
25|$|After the {{deadline}} passed, the army commenced with bombardment {{of the village}} with <b>continuous</b> <b>fire</b> from the 6-pounder cannon, and the villagers returned fire with muskets. The Stikine attempted {{to take out the}} artillery by positioning musket-armed skirmishers in an advantageous position on a hill overlooking the fort from the rear, however they were repulsed with canister shot.|$|E
25|$|On {{the southwestern}} {{side of the}} American base, C Company was met by another {{communist}} attack head on. Moving parallel to the highway along {{the western side of}} the road, the Viet Cong ran across 500 meters of open ground towards C Company's positions from the southwest. <b>Continuous</b> <b>fire</b> from the Americans quickly overwhelmed the communists. The company never reported seeing more than a platoon of Viet Cong in the clearing, although many more communists fired from the woods.|$|E
60|$|On the left, {{the sound}} of <b>continuous</b> <b>firing</b> told that Major Cobbe was still heavily engaged. There was, however, no means of moving through the bush to his assistance. The force {{therefore}} returned to the fort.|$|R
5000|$|After {{about three}} hours of <b>continuous</b> <b>firing,</b> my machine gun barrels needed changing; my recoil system was so hot that it wouldn't run back and my loader/operator Ken Hall, had fainted with the continual hard work and fumes.|$|R
50|$|By 4 oâ€™clock {{the wind}} had died, the sea {{becoming}} flat calm, and visibility dropping due to battle smoke. The <b>continuous</b> <b>firing</b> also tended to push the embattled ships apart, offering some respite, as both sides were becoming exhausted.|$|R
25|$|In April 2012, reports {{surfaced}} that G36 rifles used in Afghanistan would overheat during prolonged firefights {{after several}} hundred rounds were fired. Overheating {{affected the accuracy}} of the G36, making it difficult to hit targets past 100 m, ineffective past 200 m, and incapable of effective fire past 300 meters. The G36 has been called unsuitable for long battles. H said the rifle was not designed for sustained, <b>continuous</b> <b>fire.</b> German soldiers gave no negative feedback. Operational commanders advised allowing the weapon to cool between periods of rapid shooting.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the heavy}} {{artillery}} (twelve guns) {{were in place}} however <b>continuous</b> <b>fire</b> from these began to take their effect on the besieged. Soon after the French launched an assault on a bastion {{on the right side}} and the English on the left. The battle lasted three hours, but in the confusion a tremendous explosion appeared behind the attacking French causing the attackers to retreat in panic fearing a Spanish attack in the rear. It had turned out several huge barrels of gunpowder blew up in one of the main French siege batteries (either ignited by accident or by a stray Spanish shot) killing or wounding many.|$|E
25|$|In {{company with}} members of the Fifteenth Company of Marines all mounted, Captain Upshur left Fort Liberte, Haiti, for a 6-day reconnaissance. After dark on the evening of 24 October 1915, while {{crossing}} the river in a deep ravine, the detachments was suddenly fired upon form three sides by about 400 Cacos concealed in bushes about 100 yards from the fort. The Marine detachment fought its way forward to a good position, which it maintained during the night, although subjected to a <b>continuous</b> <b>fire</b> from the Cacos. At daybreak, Captain Upshur, in command of the three squads which advanced in three different directions, led his men forward, surprising and scattering the Cacos, and aiding the capture of Fort Dipitie.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{propulsion}} systems {{can also be}} characterized as either steady (<b>continuous</b> <b>firing</b> for a prescribed duration) or unsteady (pulsed firings accumulating to a desired impulse). However, these classifications are not unique to electric {{propulsion systems}} and {{can be applied to}} all types of propulsion engines.|$|R
50|$|The {{machine gun}} {{mounted in the}} turret was not a belt-fed type but rather the Type 97 tank-mounted heavy machine gun that used 20-round {{magazine}} clips.

25|$|Operation Desert Storm began {{early on}} 17 January 1991, and the 11th Marines fired its first {{artillery}} mission against Iraqi forces, when {{elements of the}} regiment conducted an early morning surface artillery raid just south of Khafji. This {{was the first in}} a series of 11th Marines artillery raids conducted along the Saudi Arabian/Kuwaiti border, both on the Persian Gulf coast and along the south-west border area near several oil fields. As the major coalition ground offensive began on 24 February, the 11th Marines was already inside Kuwait providing vital fire support to Task Forces Grizzly and Taro. Throughout Operation Desert Storm, the 11th Marines provided close and <b>continuous</b> <b>fire</b> support to the 1st Marine Division.|$|E
25|$|Weakened by the eighteen-month Blockade of the Gaza Strip, as of 31 December {{the central}} drug store {{reported}} that 105 drugs and 255 medical supplies {{of the essential}} drug and supplies list are still unavailable, and approximately 20 percent of the ambulances were grounded {{due to lack of}} spare parts. Ambulances are experiencing difficulties in reaching the injured because of <b>continuous</b> <b>fire.</b> Hospitals reporting severe gas shortages expect total depletion in the coming days. As a result of shortages, the WFP distributed canned meat and high energy biscuits. The World Health Organisation reported that at least 1,000 medical machines were out of order, with shortage of equipment and spare parts. Sources from the Palestinian Ministry of Health reported that the situation on 2 January, while extremely precarious, has stabilized after the arrival of medical supplies.|$|E
25|$|At 8:00, the French {{artillery}} at {{the larger}} tank fired the first shot, killing one and wounding another from the grenadier {{company of the}} 39th Regiment. This, as a signal, {{the rest of the}} Nawab's artillery started a heavy and <b>continuous</b> <b>fire.</b> The advanced field pieces of the British opposed the French fire, while those with the battalion opposed the rest of the Nawab's artillery. Their shots did not serve to immobilize the artillery but hit the infantry and cavalry divisions. By 8:30, the British had lost 10 Europeans and 20 sepoys. Leaving the advanced artillery at the brick kilns, Clive ordered the army to retreat back to relative shelter of the grove. The rate of casualties of the British dropped substantially due to the protection of the embankment.|$|E
50|$|Dawn {{launched}} on September 27, 2007, {{to explore the}} asteroid Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres. It used three Deep Space 1 heritage xenon ion thrusters (firing one at a time). An extended mission to explore other asteroids is possible. Dawn's ion drive is capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mi/h km/h in 4 days of <b>continuous</b> <b>firing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Noxious {{input to}} {{the spinal cord}} is known to produce central sensitization, which {{consists}} of allodynia, exaggeration of pain, and punctuate hyperalgesia, extreme sensitivity to pain. Two types of mechanical hyperalgesia can occur: 1) touch that is normally painless in the uninjured surroundings of a cut or tear can trigger painful sensations (touch-evoked hyperalgesia), and 2) a slightly painful pin prick stimulation is perceived as more painful around a focused area of inflammation (punctuate hyperalgesia). Touch-evoked hyperalgesia requires <b>continuous</b> <b>firing</b> of primary afferent nociceptors, and punctuate hyperalgesia does not require <b>continuous</b> <b>firing</b> which means it can persist for hours after a trauma and can be stronger than normally experienced. In addition, {{it was found that}} patients with neuropathic pain, histamine ionophoresis resulted in a sensation of burning pain rather than itch, which would be induced in normal healthy patients. This shows that there is spinal hypersensitivity to C-fiber input in chronic pain.|$|R
60|$|Three or {{four minutes}} later they started, Abdool {{carrying}} a bundle containing Harry's disguises. They {{made their way}} through lanes, where the people were all standing at their doors, talking excitedly. <b>Continuous</b> <b>firing</b> was heard {{in the direction of}} the better quarters, mingled with shouts and cries. No one questioned them, all being too anxious as to their own safety to think of anything else.|$|R
25|$|Artillery {{was rarely}} placed inside a village {{because of the}} danger of the {{buildings}} catching fire and detonating the ammunition. Instead the guns were placed alongside a village or on a hill behind it. On the battlefield, the light artillery was stationed in the front line or covering the flanks. Typically, howitzers were assigned to a battery to use their long-range shell fire. In order to achieve mutual support, batteries were placed 600â€“900 paces apart. If action was imminent, the cannons would be loaded in advance and two matches kept lit. If forced to unlimber under fire, it was best to approach the desired position from a flank to present the thinnest target. When an eight-gun battery was unlimbered, the cannons fired in turn, one every four seconds, {{in order to keep the}} target under <b>continuous</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
25|$|At the end {{of three}} hours, there was no {{substantial}} progress and the positions of both sides had not changed. Clive called a meeting of his staff to discuss the way ahead. It was concluded that the present position would be maintained till after nightfall, and {{an attack on the}} Nawab's camp should be attempted at midnight. Soon after the conference, a heavy rainstorm occurred. The British used tarpaulins to protect their ammunition, while the Nawab's army took no such precautions. As a result, their gunpowder got drenched and their rate of fire slackened, while Clive's artillery kept up a <b>continuous</b> <b>fire.</b> As the rain began to subside, Mir Madan Khan, assuming that the British guns were rendered ineffective by the rain, led his cavalry to a charge. However, the British countered the charge with heavy grape shot, mortally wounding Mir Madan Khan and driving back his men.|$|E
25|$|In July Spinola himself {{made another}} attempt to relieve Sluis under orders from the Archduke saying that Spain {{could not afford to}} lose another Flemish port. On the 28th he encamped between Bruges and Damme, with 10,000 men and 600 wagons laden with {{supplies}} and ammunition. He thence advanced passing Ardenburg towards the quarters of Van der Node. His objective was to reach the town by a wide causeway which was still open. Maurice however saw the plan and set a large force to work, and in forty-eight hours he had dug a trench across, which effectually stopped the passage. He then mounted several guns between the quarters of Van der Node and Count William, and opened a heavy and <b>continuous</b> <b>fire</b> on the camp of Spinola. By now hunger and infectious diseases took their toll on the civilians and soldiers alike in Sluis, but eventually news of the Spanish relief force was on the way and much hope was somewhat restored.|$|E

25|$|The President of the United States of America, in {{the name}} of Congress, takes {{pleasure}} in presenting the Medal of Honor (Second Award) to Gunnery Sergeant Daniel Joseph Daly (MCSN: 73086), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism in action while serving with the 15th Company of Marines (Mounted), 2d Marine Regiment, on 22 October 1915. Gunnery Sergeant Daly was one of the company to leave Fort Liberte, Haiti, for a six-day reconnaissance. After dark on the evening of 24 October, while crossing the river in a deep ravine, the detachment was suddenly fired upon from three sides by about 400 Cacos concealed in bushes about 100 yards from the fort. The Marine detachment fought its way forward to a good position, which it maintained during the night, although subjected to a <b>continuous</b> <b>fire</b> from the Cacos. At daybreak the Marines, in three squads, advanced in three different directions, surprising and scattering the Cacos in all directions. Gunnery Sergeant Daly fought with exceptional gallantry against heavy odds throughout this action.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving with the Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on the Island of Peleliu in the Palau Group, September 18, 1944. Boldly taking the initiative when his platoon's left flank advance was held up by the fire of Japanese troops concealed in strongly fortified positions, Private First Class Jackson unhesitatingly proceeded forward of our lines and, courageously defying the heavy barrages, charged a large pillbox housing approximately thirty-five enemy soldiers. Pouring his automatic fire into the opening of the fixed installation to trap the occupying troops, he hurled white phosphorus grenades and explosive charges brought up by a fellow Marine, demolishing the pillbox and killing all of the enemy. Advancing alone under the <b>continuous</b> <b>fire</b> from other hostile emplacements, he employed a similar means to smash two smaller positions in the immediate vicinity. Determined to crush the entire pocket of resistance although harassed on all sides by the shattering blasts of Japanese weapons and covered only by small rifle parties, he stormed one gun position after another, dealing death and destruction to the savagely fighting enemy in his inexorable drive against the remaining defenses and succeeded in wiping out a total of twelve pillboxes and fifty Japanese soldiers. Stouthearted and indomitable despite the terrific odds, Private First Class Jackson resolutely maintained control of the platoon's left flank movement throughout his valiant one-man assault and, by his cool decision and relentless fighting spirit during a critical situation, contributed essentially to the complete annihilation of the enemy in the southern sector of the island. His gallant initiative and heroic conduct in the face of extreme peril reflect the highest credit upon Private First Class Jackson and the United States Naval Service.|$|E
500|$|Finding {{out that}} his old friend Ulysses Grant was {{in command of the}} Union Army, he told his fellow {{officers}} that [...] "he will fight us every day and every hour {{until the end of the}} war." [...] Longstreet helped save the Confederate Army from defeat in his first battle back with Lee's army, the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864, in which he launched a powerful flanking attack along the Orange Plank Road against the Union II Corps and nearly drove it from the field. Once again he developed innovative tactics to deal with difficult terrain, ordering the advance of six brigades by heavy skirmish lines, which allowed his men to deliver a <b>continuous</b> <b>fire</b> into the enemy, while proving to be elusive targets themselves. Wilderness historian Edward Steere attributed much of the success of the Army to [...] "the display of tactical genius by Longstreet which more than redressed his disparity in numerical strength." [...] After the war, the Union II Corps commander that day, Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, said to Longstreet of this flanking maneuver: [...] "You rolled me up like a wet blanket." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{anti-aircraft}} batteries were prime {{targets for}} the bombings; they often ran out of ammunition or became fatigued from <b>continuous</b> <b>firing,</b> but the dive bombing technique used by the Stukas allowed the AA crews to foresee where bombs would fall, and to shoot at the bombers during the manoeuvre which followed the dive, when they were particularly vulnerable. The Italian battery on Mt. Patella was able to shoot down eight bombers {{by taking advantage of}} this weak point.|$|R
30|$|We {{conclude}} that models with a Heaviside firing rate function can have several solutions â€“ such problems can thus become ill-posed. (In [9] {{we showed that}} the initial-condition-to-solution map is not necessarily continuous for such problems and that the error amplification ratio can become very large in the steep but Lipschitz <b>continuous</b> <b>firing</b> rate regime.) Note that switching to the integral form (27) will not resolve the lack of uniqueness issue for the toy example considered in this subsection.|$|R
50|$|While the Chassepot's {{ballistic}} {{performance and}} firing rates were excellent for the time, burnt paper residues {{as well as}} black powder fouling accumulated in the chamber and bolt mechanism after <b>continuous</b> <b>firing.</b> Also, the bolt's rubber obturator eroded in action, although it was easily replaced in the field by infantrymen. The older Dreyse needle gun and its cartridge had been deliberately constructed {{in a way to}} minimize those problems but to the detriment of its ballistic properties.|$|R
