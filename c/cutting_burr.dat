40|$|Background: Inadvertent {{drilling}} on the {{ossicular chain}} {{is one of}} the causes of sensorineural hearing loss (HL) that may follow tympanomastoid surgery. A high-frequency HL is most frequently observed. It is speculated that the HL is a result of vibration of the ossicular chain resembling acoustic noise trauma. It is generally considered that using a large <b>cutting</b> <b>burr</b> is more likely to cause damage than a small diamond burr. Aim: The aim was to investigate the equivalent noise level and its frequency characteristics generated by drilling onto the short process of the incus in fresh human temporal bones. Methods and Materials: Five fresh cadaveric temporal bones were used. Stapes displacement was measured using laser Doppler vibrometry during short drilling episodes. Diamond and cutting burrs of different diameters were used. The effect of the drilling on stapes footplate displacement was compared with that generated by an acoustic signal. The equivalent noise level (dB sound pressure level equivalent [SPL eq]) was thus calculated. Results: The equivalent noise levels generated ranged from 93 to 125 dB SPL eq. For a 1 -mm <b>cutting</b> <b>burr,</b> the highest equivalent noise level was 108 dB SPL eq, whereas a 2. 3 -mm <b>cutting</b> <b>burr</b> produced a maximal level of 125 dB SPL eq. Diamond burrs generated less noise than their cutting counterparts, with a 2. 3 -mm diamond burr producing a highest equivalent noise level of 102 dB SPL eq. The energy of the noise increased at the higher end of the frequency spectrum, with a 2. 3 -mm <b>cutting</b> <b>burr</b> producing a noise level of 105 dB SPL eq at 1 kHz and 125 dB SPL eq at 8 kHz. In contrast, the same sized diamond burr produced 96 dB SPL eq at 1 kHz and 99 dB at 8 kHz. Conclusion: This study suggests that drilling on the ossicular chain can produce vibratory force that is analogous with noise levels known to produce acoustic trauma. For the same type of burr, the larger the diameter, the greater the vibratory force, and for the same size of burr, the <b>cutting</b> <b>burr</b> creates more vibratory force than the diamond burr. The <b>cutting</b> <b>burr</b> produces greater high-frequency than lower-frequency vibratory energy...|$|E

40|$|Objective: In some {{surgical}} specialties (eg, orthopedics), robots {{are already}} {{used in the}} operating room for bony milling work. Otological surgery and otoneurosurgery may also greatly benefit from the enhanced precision of robotics. Study Design: Experimental study on robotic milling of oak wood and human temporal bone specimen. Methods: A standard industrial robot with a six-degrees-of-freedom serial kinematics was used, with force feedback to proportionally control the robot speed. Different milling modes and characteristic path parameters were evaluated to generate milling paths based on computeraided design (CAD) geometry data of a cochlear implant and an implantable hearing system. Results: The best-suited strategy proved to be the spiral horizontal milling mode with the burr held perpendicular to the temporal bone surface. To reduce groove height, the distance between paths should equal half the radius of the <b>cutting</b> <b>burr</b> head. Because of the vibration of the robot’s own motors, a high oscillation of the SD of forces was encountered. This oscillation dropped drastically to nearly 0 Newton (N) when the burr head made contact with the dura mater, because of its damping characteristics. The <b>cutting</b> <b>burr</b> could be kept in contact with the dura mater for an extended period without damaging it, because of the burr’s blunt head form.

40|$|Hypothesis:During robotic milling of the {{temporal}} bone, forces on the <b>cutting</b> <b>burr</b> may be lowered by choice of cutting parameters. Background: Robotic bone removal systems are used in or-thopedic procedures, but they are currently not accurate enough for safe use in otologic surgery. We propose {{the use of a}} bone-attached milling robot to achieve the required accuracy and speed. To design such a robot and plan its milling trajectories, it is necessary to predict the forces that the robot must exert and withstand under likely cutting conditions. Materials and Methods: We measured forces during bone re-moval for several surgical burr types, drill angles, depths of cut, cutting velocities, and bone types (cortical/surface bone and mastoid) on human temporal bone specimens. Results: Lower forces were observed for 5 -mm diameter burrs compared with 3 -mm burrs for a given bone removal rate. Higher linear cutting velocities and greater cutting depths in-dependently resulted in higher forces. For combinations of velocities and depths that resulted in the same overall bone re-moval rate, lower forces were observed in parameter sets that combined higher cutting velocities and shallower depths. Lower mean forces and higher variability were observed in the mastoid compared with cortical/surface bone. Conclusion: Forces during robotic milling of {{the temporal}} bone can be predicted from the parameter sets tested in this study. This information can be used to guide the design of a suffi-ciently rigid and powerful bone-attached milling robot and to plan efficient milling trajectories.

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 18 calvarial bone grafts (CBGs) were {{harvested}} from 9 cadavers with the BHD. The recorded parameters included drilling time, graft harvest time, graft size, graft integrity, and violation of the calvarial inner table. Five CBGs were subsequently harvested in vivo and used for 2 nasal reconstructions and 3 orbital reconstructions. RESULTS: The CBG dimensions ranged from 1. 25 to 2. 5 cm in width and 3. 0 to 16. 0 cm in length. Graft harvest time ranged from 5 minutes, 55 seconds to 25 minutes, 30 seconds (mean 13 minutes, 7 sec-onds). There were no fractured grafts. The cadaver-ic inner table was violated twice with a <b>cutting</b> <b>burr,</b> and 1 dural exposure occurred in the clinical study. CONCLUSION: Although caution must be used with all CBGs, the BHD appears to be safe and more effi-cient than osteotomes or oscillating saws. (Otolaryn-gol Head Neck Surg 2000; 123 : 547 - 52.) Defects of the facial skeleton historically have been repaired with autologous grafts from the rib, 1 pelvis, 2 and tibia. 3 The calvarial bone graft (CBG) was first described as an osteocutaneous vascularized flap in 1890. 4 In the 1970 s Smith and Abramson 5 and Tessier 6 popularized {{the use of}} free outer table CBGs. Current applications for CBGs range from the repair of traumatic and congenital deformities to aesthetic uses in rhinoplasty. Numerous techniques have been described to harvest CBGs. The absence of a well-accepted, standardized method indicates the lack of a superior technique.

In the present paper, a fundamental investigation of burr formation in the flat surface grinding of tempered tool steel (90 MnCrV 8) is presented. Conventional and superabrasive grinding wheels with different grain sizes and materials are used under varying cutting conditions.

40|$|Manufacturers are {{increasingly}} using high strength press hardened steels, which allow components such as B-pillars or side sills to be thinner and more lightweight and yet {{offer the same}} or better performance {{in the event of}} a crash [1]. But using these high-strength steels requires changes in processing after press hardening. High-strength steels are mainly cut using lasers because die cutting leads to rapid wear of the die [2]. Considering that the strength of new steels exceed the limit of 1500 MPa of steels in use towards 2000 MPa (e. g. MBW-K 1900 [3]) die cutting will even no longer be possible. However, laser cutting may lead to an undesired increase in hardness along the cut edge which can cause severe failure during a crash [4]. A way to overcome this problem is a local softening of the edge via laser heat treatment. The ability of a local laser softening has already been proved for press hardened steels up to 1500 MPa [5]. The main challenge here is to combine laser cutting with laser softening which is mandatory to achieve an economic process. To successfully implement both processes in one operation it is the aim to accomplish a burr-free cutting edge and a lateral softening zone of 2. 5 nun with a hardness of 300 HV 10. Both processes operate normally at different speeds (laser cutting typically around 10000 mm/min, laser softening typically around 1000 mm/min). To combine both processes as a hybrid treatment they have to operate at the same speed. In a first stage cutting and softening were investigated regarding a decrease and an increase in speed, respectively. Laser cutting was performed with a 4 kW fiber laser, whereas for laser softening a 12 kW diode laser was used. Cutting at lower speeds (around 5000 mm/min) shows an increase of the <b>cutting</b> <b>burr,</b> which can be reduced by an increase in gas pressure. Increasing the speed of laser heat treatment towards 5000 mm/min leads to an inhomogeneous temperature profile across the irradiated area as well as across the sheet thickness. When the material is heated above the alpha/gamma transus martensite is formed again due to high cooling rates. Therefore tempering is the best way to reduce the hardness. To improve the temperature profile beam shaping is under investigation. First results on the combined process will also be presented regarding the effect of the high cutting gas flow on the cooling during local laser heat treatment...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and Objectives: Computer Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS) {{techniques}} {{are increasingly being}} applied {{to the challenge of}} ensuring accurate implant positioning during Unicondylar Knee Arthroplasty (UKA). Both commercial systems in this field use bulky infrared stereoscopic tracking systems, that restrict patient access, and standard monitors that divide the surgeon’s attention away from the patient. We present a comparison of two prototype CAOS systems which utilise significantly smaller tracking systems and provide surgical guidance through Augmented Reality (AR). AR mixes both real and virtual imagery to offer a non-intrusive and intuitive form of guidance. Methods: Both systems are based upon six degrees of freedom tracking of fiducial markers using visible spectrum Microsoft Lifecam Studio web cameras, developed under the OpenCV library. The live video used for tracking is augmented in real-time with virtual elements, such as CT models and alignment guides, by a modern OpenGL engine. Passive control is provided by coloured resection models while additional active control is achieved through speed control of the <b>cutting</b> <b>burr.</b> The systems differ in their tracking and display systems. The first system uses a tool-mounted monoscopic camera with the augmented video displayed on a standard monitor. The second system uses a head-mounted stereoscopic camera and a head mounted display (HMD). The accuracy of both systems was determined by probing 108 known points on a 110 x 110 x 50 mm geometry. System latency was also measured, as the time delay between video capture and display of the final augmented frame. Finally the practicality, comfort and intuitiveness of guidance were gauged through user feedback. Results: The monoscopic and stereoscopic systems produced an accuracy of 1. 5 ± 0. 3 and 2. 1 ± 0. 6 mm, respectively. However, the validity of these results is questionable as it was found the test points were inaccurate, particularly in the z axis. The monoscopic system presented an average latency of 263 ± 55 ms compared to 293 ± 15 ms for the stereoscopic system. Both systems rated well for intuitiveness, with the natural view and 3 D display of the stereoscopic system making some instructions clearer. The monoscopic system offered superior comfort. However, tasks such as hip centre location, which required two hands and tracking of multiple markers, were more practical with the stereoscopic system. Conclusion: Due to the inaccuracies of the current target a new 3 D printed target is being produced with sub- 50 μm accuracy. Based on the results currently available, however, both systems produced accuracies outwith the desired submillimetre target. It is felt that this should be reached with several basic modifications. With the advent of USB 3. 0 cameras, higher resolution images may be streamed at high frame rates. This will allow more accurate marker detection and should therefore improve pose estimation. Additionally, all experiments were performed using small 20 mm markers. Larger markers would provide more data points for detection and a wider point base for pose estimation, both of which offer a potential accuracy boost. Both systems produced latencies which were not readily perceivable to the user. This is particularly important for the HMD of the stereoscopic system, where large latencies may induce ‘simulator sickness’. It is felt that the hands-free and natural view offered by the stereoscopic system makes it the superior technology, particularly for use in a surgical environment. This is despite the inherent reduced accuracy resulting from tool to target tracking requiring an additional marker compared to the monoscopic system. If the desired accuracy is achieved it is hoped that the intuitiveness afforded by the augmented guidance will make the system appealing to healthcare professionals by keeping learning curves to a minimum. This will therefore increase the adoption of CAOS technologies...|$|E

Phase transformation during machining was also examined. The experimental design approach {{was used to}} study the effect of <b>cutting</b> parameters on <b>burr</b> formation. The studied parameters were cutting speed, feed per tooth, depth and width of cut, 20 machining strategy and initial material phase of the NiTi alloy. Different types of burrs were formed during micro-end milling of NiTi alloys; {{it was observed that}} top burrs are the most important. The height of top burrs can reach values close to those of the depth of cut. Burrs were observed and characterized using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), confocal and optical microscopes. The affected layer under the machined surface, and phase transformation 25 were investigated by using SEM. The results of the analysis of variance showed a significant formation of burrs, deeply influenced by the feed per tooth and width of cut. An increase in the feed per tooth and a decrease of width of cut tend to decrease the height and width of the top burr. In a thin layer under the machined surface, phase transformation was observed for the martensitic NiTi.

40|$|Increasing {{interest}} in commercializing functional nanostructured devices heightens {{the need for}} cost-effective manufacturing approaches for nanostructures. This paper presents an investigation of a scale-up manufacturing approach for nanostructures through diamond turning using a nanoscale multi-tip diamond tool (four tip tool with tip width of 150 nm) fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB). The manufacturing capacity of this new technique is evaluated {{through a series of}} cutting trials on copper substrates under different cutting conditions (depth of cut 100 – 500 nm, spindle speed 12 – 120 rpm). The machined surface roughness and nanostructure patterns are measured by using a white light interferometer and a scanning electron microscope, respectively. Results show that the form accuracy and integrity of the machined nanostructures were degraded with the increase of the depth of cut and the <b>cutting</b> speed. The <b>burr</b> and the structure damage are two major machining defects. High precision nano-grooves (form error of bottom width < 6. 7 %) was achieved when a small depth of cut of 100 nm was used (spindle speed[*]=[*] 12 rpm). Initial tool wear was found at both the clearance cutting edge and the side edges of tool tips after a cutting distance of 2. 5 km. Moreover, the nanometric cutting process was emulated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The research findings obtained from MD simulation reveal the underlying mechanism for machining defects and the initialization of tool wear observed in experiments...|$|R
40|$|A tecnologia avançada de corte com jato de água pode ser usada em chapas de polipropileno. Os modernos sistemas são compostos por: bomba de alta pressão, mesa XY e computador. O corte no sistema cria uma ranhura com características próprias. A largura do sulco é maior na entrada que na saída do corte. No corte do polipropileno podem surgir rebarbas na base da chapa como pequenas fibras. Experiência adquirida na confecção de peneiras mostrou que o número de furos é decisivo no custo da peça. Ensaios preliminares simularam alternativas de corte com e sem abrasivo. A abertura de 900 furos numa área de 967 cm² revelou consumir 126 minutos para corte sem abrasivo, contra 201 no caso mais oneroso. A seguir, novos desenhos foram propostos diminuindo a malha, mas, preservando o índice de vazamento. Assim, 145, 218 ou 362 furos são possíveis. O corte de velocidade constante e com abrasivo mostrou-se o mais eficiente. Por outro lado, o modo de abrir o furo influi na qualidade da peneira. A seleção da alternativa adequada, os problemas surgidos durante a investigação e as soluções adotadas foram detalhadamente descritos no estudo. Advanced {{technology}} of waterjet cut {{can be used}} in polypropylene tableware. The modern systems comprise a high-pressure pump, XY table and computer as controller. The cutting process may lead to kerfs with specific characteristics. The kerf width is larger in the entrance than in the jet exit. In <b>cutting</b> polypropylene, <b>burrs</b> in the base of the plate can appear as small staple fibers. Experience acquired in the confection of sieves showed that the number of punctures is decisive in the cost of the part. Preliminary assays simulated cut alternatives with and without abrasive. The opening of 900 punctures in an area of 967 cm² consumes 126 minutes for cutting without abrasive, in contrast to 201 minutes in the most costly case. New drawings were then considered with the meshes being decreased, but preserving the emptying index. Thus, 145, 218 or 362 punctures are possible. The cutting at a constant speed and using abrasive was the most efficient. On the other hand, {{the manner in which the}} puncture is opened influences the quality of the sieve.

40|$|AbstractLaser cutting is an {{attractive}} and innovative manufacturing process which has many advantages compared to conventional cutting methods. However, with increasing workpiece thickness an increase of the roughness along the kerf surface can be observed, which, in turn, can negatively affect the mechanical properties, in particular the fatigue strength. In this context, {{the purpose of the}} present study is to investigate the impact of the geometrical surface characteristics and microstructural changes after laser cutting in order to support the cutting process optimization concerning cyclic durability. Fatigue strength evaluation is performed with specimens cut out by high-power solid-state disk laser from sheets with thickness of 2, 4 and 6 mm made of metastable austenitic stainless steel type 304. Cyclic tests are carried out using a resonant pulsation testing system at test frequencies around 100 Hz at two different load modes, purely reversal load condition (R = - 1) and tensile-tensile load condition (R = 0. 1). In order to evaluate separately the effect of surface relief over the <b>cutting</b> kerf and <b>burr</b> in form of re-solidified drops, the fatigue specimens are tested at different surface conditions. The investigation comprises fractographic analyses in order to evaluate the influence of the surface roughness and surface-related macro defects on crack initiation. Additionally, phase analyses are performed to assess the deformation-induced phase transformation during cyclic testing and its influence on fatigue behavior, as well as microstructural investigation to analyze the material microstructural changes during the cutting process and its impact on material mechanical properties. The influence on fatigue strength of parts cut by laser is quantified and the characteristic dominating the fatigue life is identified...|$|R
