Waller unsuccessfully maintained at his trial that the killing had been in self-defense, but was <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jury of white citizens who had paid the poll tax, a measure that effectively barred blacks and poor whites from jury service.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{week after}} being {{appointed}} by Harrison, Crittenden was dispatched to New York to mediate tensions with Great Britain over {{the sinking of the}} steamboat Caroline by a group of Canadian militia, who were attempting to suppress a rebellion in Canada. In this diplomatic endeavor, Crittenden was acting separately from his official duties as attorney general. He spoke with New York Governor William H. Seward and secured his promise to pardon Alexander McLeod, who had seized and burned the Caroline, if he were <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crime in New York. Ultimately, McLeod was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} {{texts of}} Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice {{the virtue of}} Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment. Arthashastra discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.|$|E

5|$|After {{his arrest}} Biko {{was held in}} custody in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape for several days, during which he was interrogated. During his {{interrogation}} he was severely beaten {{by some of the}} policemen questioning him. He suffered severe injuries, including his brain, and died soon after on 12 September 1977. News of his death spread quickly, and became a symbol of the abuses perpetrated under the apartheid government. Biko's position as an individual who had never been <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crime led to the death being reported in the international press; he thus became one of first anti-apartheid activists widely known internationally.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} his first criminal conviction in November 1977, aged 15, for burglary. Between 1977 and 1984, he accrued six more convictions {{and was sentenced}} to a care order until the age of 18 for robbery in August 1978. In January 1980 he was convicted of two further crimes including theft of property from his lodgings the night before De Simone's murder. He was subsequently <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of burglaries committed in Portsmouth for which he received an 18-month custodial sentence of which he served 9months. Following his release he committed robbery again and was sentenced at Portsmouth Crown Court to five years and nine months imprisonment, which he served at HMP Dartmoor.|$|E

A group of doctors {{requested}} an investigation by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure to determine whether Fletcher's medical license should be revoked for that action. Kentucky requires doctors to follow the guidelines of the American Medical Association, which forbid doctors from participating in an execution. On January 13, 2005, the Board of Medical Licensure found that Fletcher was acting in his capacity as governor, not as a doctor, when he signed the warrant and ruled that his license was not subject to forfeiture by that action.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{followers}} (called Rajneeshees) of charismatic leader Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (now {{known as}} Osho), were <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 1985 conspiracy to assassinate Charles Turner, {{and an additional}} unindicted eighth member of the Rajneesh commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy. The perpetrators were high-ranking followers within the Rajneeshee organization. Prosecutors in the case stated that the perpetrators had planned to murder Turner after he was appointed to head {{an investigation into the}} group's activities in Rajneeshpuram, Oregon. Turner's investigation focused on sham marriages organized by the group, as well as other illegal activities including immigration fraud, and he later headed the federal prosecution relating to the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack in The Dalles, Oregon. Oregon Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer was also involved in investigations of the group, working alongside Turner.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Helmand Province {{incident}} was the manslaughter of an injured Taliban insurgent by Alexander Blackman, which occurred on 15 September 2011. Three Royal Marines, known during their trial as Marines A, B, and C, were anonymously tried by court-martial. On 8 November 2013, Marines B and C were acquitted, but Marine A was initially {{found guilty of}} murder of the Afghan combatant, in contravention of section 42 of the Armed Forces Act 2006. This made him the first British soldier to be <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> battlefield murder whilst serving abroad since the Second World War.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{reports the}} results <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{investigation}} into the relationship between corporate boards and the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>a</b> firm being <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> environmental offence in the United Kingdom (UK). Design/Methodology/Approach: The study uses a probit model to analyse the relationship between corporate boards and the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>a</b> firm being <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> environmental offence in the UK, controlling for firm size, financial leverage and profitability. Findings: The {{results suggest that the}} likelihood <b>of</b> <b>a</b> firm being <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> environmental offence increases with board size, but decreases with the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman on the board. No support is found for our hypotheses about the proportion of outside directors and the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lawyer on the board. Marginal effects results also show that adding one member to the board increases the chance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> firm being <b>convicted</b> for an environmental offence by 4. 2 % while having a woman on the board decreases the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>a</b> firm being <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> environmental offence by 31. 8 %. Research limitations/implications: The sample size of 55 firms is small which could affect the generalisability of the study. Originality/Value: The study uses proprietary data obtained from the UK Environmental Agency to provide evidence for the first time how corporate boards affect the chances <b>of</b> <b>a</b> listed firm being <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> environmental offence in the UK. <br/...|$|R

5|$|The next {{significant}} role {{is played by}} the charity trustees, defined in Section 97 of the 1993 Act as those persons having the general control {{and management of the}} administration of charities. As mentioned, charitable trustees have significantly more freedom to act than normal trustees, but the 1993 Act has put restrictions on who may be a charitable trustee. Section 72 excludes people <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crime involving dishonesty, bankrupts, people previously removed from charity trusteeship, and people struck off as directors of companies. Those trustees appointed have many duties when administering the trust, including informing the Commission of changes to the charity or its dissolution, registering the charity and keeping proper accounts and records, to be submitted annually to the Commission.|$|E
5|$|Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is an {{executive}} {{editor in chief}} of a book publishing company. After learning she is about to be deported to Canada because she violated the terms of her work visa, she persuades her assistant, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds), to marry her. She reminds Andrew that if she's deported, the work he put in as her assistant will be lost, and he'll be set back in his dream to become an editor. Mr. Gilbertson, a U.S. immigration agent, informs them that he suspects they are committing fraud to avoid Margaret's deportation. Gilbertson tells them that they'll be asked questions about each other separately. If their answers don't match, Margaret will be deported to Canada permanently and Andrew will be <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> felony punishable by a $250,000 fine and five years in prison. Andrew insists that Margaret make him an editor after their marriage and publish the book he's been recommending to her. Margaret agrees.|$|E
5|$|Petrosino {{received}} anonymous {{letters from}} Neapolitans in New York that confirmed Alfano's {{presence in the}} city, where he allegedly had given a banquet to several local Camorra members in a Grand Street restaurant. On April 17, 1907, Petrosino and his agents raided the apartment at 108 Mulberry Street where Alfano was living and arrested him. The arrest caused a sensation in Naples. He had been <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crime involving moral turpitude in Italy and {{was turned over to}} the Federal authorities. Within three days he was expelled and put on a ship to Le Havre in France, where he was picked up by the Italian police. He was put behind bars in Naples. According to some sources, Alfano was the man behind Petrosino's murder in Palermo on March 12, 1909, which has since been attributed to the Sicilian Mafia, and to Vito Cascioferro in particular.|$|E

5|$|The censors {{were the}} magistrates who {{enforced}} the ethical {{standards of the}} Senate. Whenever a censor punished a senator, they had to allege some specific failing. Possible reasons for punishing a member included corruption, abuse of capital punishment, or the disregard of a colleague's veto, constitutional precedent, or the auspices. Senators who failed to obey various laws could also be punished. While punishment could include impeachment (expulsion) from the Senate, often a punishment was less severe than outright expulsion. While the standard was high for expelling a member from the Senate, {{it was easier to}} deny a citizen the right to join the Senate. Various moral failings could result in one not being allowed to join the Senate, including bankruptcy, prostitution, or a prior history of having been a gladiator. One law (the Lex repetundarum of 123 BC) made it illegal for a citizen to become a senator if they had been <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> criminal offense. Many of these laws were enacted in the last century of the Republic, as public corruption began reaching unprecedented levels.|$|E
