40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a proposal to}} employ the design computing methodology proposed as StructuralComponents (Rolvink et al [6] and van de Weerd et al [7]) as a method to perform a digital verification process to fulfil the requirements related to structural design and engineering {{as part of a}} building design. In current design and engineering computing methodologies often only very limited design and engineering activities are digitised, such as the analysis and documentation (drawings). However, the conceptual justification that a structural designer makes in order to prove that a structure can withstand all scenarios with an appropriate low risk of exceeding its (structural) capacity rarely finds its way fully to paper or into computer programs. The research project on StructuralComponents works towards the goal to provide the computational framework to digitise this conceptual scenario-based justification in parametric and associative scenarios, analysis and documentation. This paper proposes to further structure this design computing methodology by integrating it with concepts from Systems Engineering (SE). INCOSE, The International Council on Systems Engineering [5], defines Systems Engineering as “Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realisation of successful systems. It focuses on defining customer needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, and then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem: operations, cost and schedule, performance, training and support, test, manufacturing, and disposal. SE considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers with the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user needs. ” Systems Engineerings employs concepts like requirements and system breakdown structures to decompose design requirements and link them to system components that are intended fulfil these requirements. The process of ensuring that the system components and system behaviour fulfils the requirements is called the verification process. The proposal is for StructuralComponents to fulfil the function of a digital means to perform this verification during the design process. The authors propose to add a standardised Structural Requirements Breakdown Structure (SRBS) to the Requirements Breakdown Structure that fulfil the root requirement of a safe and functional structure. Additionally, the authors propose to add <b>Calculation</b> <b>Breakdown</b> Structure (CBS) to the methodology that contain the various calculations which prove that the structural elements in the System Breakdown Structure fulfil the requirements on the Structural Requirements Breakdown Structure.

For both types of nanostructured systems {{we find that the}} phonon transport is reduced significantly below the bulk value by boundary scattering off interface defects and/or interface modes. The Knudsen flow effects are important for almost all types of semiconductor nanostructures but we find them most pronounced in Si and SiC systems due to the very large phonon mean-free paths. We apply and test our wire thermal-transport results to recent measurements on Si nanowires. We further investigate and predict size effects in typical multilayered SiC nanostructures, for example, a doped-SiC/SiC/SiO$_ 2 $ layered structure that could define the transport channel in a nanosize transistor.

The pKas span 3. 3 pH units from 7. 6 in heme oxygenase 1 to 10. 9 in peroxidase, and the Ems range from- 250 mV in peroxidase to 125 mV in Aplysia myoglobin. Proteins with higher in situ ferric aquo-heme pKas {{tend to have}} lower Ems. Both changes arise from the protein stabilizing a positively charged heme. However, compared with values in solution, the protein shifts the aquo-heme Ems more than the pKas. Thus, the protein has a larger effective dielectric constant for the protonation reaction, showing that electron and proton transfers are coupled to different conformational changes that are captured in the MCCE analysis.

The tunnel was used daily {{by an average}} of 45, 000 vehicles, of which 60 % were gasoline fueled passenger cars, 20 % diesel cars, and 20 % trucks. Of the gasoline cars, only 3 % had three-way catalysts. Tunnel air concentrations of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nonmethane hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and lead are presented. The traffic emissions in the tunnel are calculated by the carbon balance method, which uses the increase of the total carbon concentration in the tunnel air as the reference quantity. Division of the concentration of any pollutant by the total carbon concentration gives emission factors per kilogram of carbon. These emission factors can be converted directly to emissions relative to fuel consumption or per kilometer.

Nuclear Shadowing Recently, measurements of diffractive jet rates in ¯pp interactions at the Tevatron were observed to be {{significantly lower than the}} theoretical expectations (for a review see [1]). The expectations were obtained using parameterizations of diffractive parton distribution functions extracted from ep interactions at HERA. The discrepancy between the data and the <b>calculations</b> revealed the <b>breakdown</b> of factorization or the onset of absorptive corrections in ¯pp diffractive events[2]. The physical reason for the breakdown of factorization is likely {{to be related to the}} different color structure of the probes in ¯pp and ep reactions. In ep, the compact, color singlet ¯qq pair produced by the virtual photon has a smaller probability of interacting with the external color fields and therefore has a larger rapidity gap survival probability. In ¯pp, the color octet gluon at comparable virtualities still interacts strongly with the external color fields, reducing its rapidity gap survival probability. The implications of the breakdown of factorization are now studied in nuclear shadowing and dijet production. Nuclear shadowing is defined as the ratio of the pA to the pp total cross section, R = σpA/Aσpp. The total cross section for pA interactions can be written as the sum of two terms σpA ≃ AσpN − δσpA, (1) where the second term, representing elastic and inelastic [3] shadowing, can be written as[3, 4] δσpA ≃ − 8 π d 2 ∫ ∞ ∫ ∞ b dz 1 dz 2 ρA(− ∞ z 1 ⃗b, z 1) ρA (⃗b, z 2) (2) dM 2 cos ((z 1 − z 2) /λ) d 2 σsd pN dM 2 [∣ exp − dt σXN z 2 dzρA...|$|R

Although many kinds of voltage breakdown have been well-explained, voltage breakdown in vacuum [...] the sudden transition from vacuum insulation to vacuum arc [...] remains relatively poorly understood. Despite the importance of vacuum insulation, technology has hardly improved breakdown voltages in the last ninety years. This work describes experiments in vacuum breakdown, as well as computer simulations of {{the initial stages of}} breakdown. 	A better understanding of voltage breakdown could particularly benefit particle accelerators used for high energy physics experiments and radiation sources, which require the highest attainable electric fields in the microwave resonators that accelerate particles. Despite some differences, voltage breakdown in microwave resonators shares some features with breakdown in DC vacuum gaps (diodes). In both cases, the localized desorption of gas around an electron emission-source (e. g., field emission) could lead to <b>breakdown.</b> Analytical <b>calculation</b> shows that <b>breakdown</b> occurs when the product of the gas density and emission current exceed a critical value. 	Voltage breakdown in vacuum results from the interaction of the electric field and the electrodes. Using a scanning electron microscope, with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to identify surface constituents, we found that breakdown occurs often at the site of foreign particles on the cathode, usually leaving only a very small trace of the original material. At the breakdown site we frequently found small craters, surrounded by a large starburst-shaped pattern; surface analysis suggests that during breakdown, ions bombard the surface within the starburst region and sputter away surface contaminants and oxides. In general, particulate contamination on the cathode determines the breakdown voltage, independent of the cathode material or the thickness of the insulating surface oxide; however, the oxide thickness does change the nature of the starburst and the damage done to the surface during breakdown.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of torque magnetometry and resistivity measurements of the electronic structure of novel quantum materials, specifically using the techniques of quantum oscillations and angle-dependent magnetoresistance oscillations. Measurements of the Fermi surfaces of these materials, alongside comparisons to the electronic structure predicted by density functional theory calculations, can elucidate much about the novel physical properties they exhibit and the competing interactions which govern their phase diagrams. The first system studied is the Iron-based superconductor FeSe 1 -x S x, an isoelectronically doped version of a system of much current interest, FeSe. Doping up to x = 0. 2 is found to suppress the structural transition in this system entirely, with superconductivity continually present at low temperatures. Shubnikov-de Haas measurements across this range find a small quasi-two dimensional Fermi surface that increases in size and warping continuously with doping, with orbital dependent effective masses that do not change significantly within the orthorhombic phase. The second material studied is the antiferromagnetic intermetallic CeZn 11 which, featuring an unpaired 4 f electron, is considered a possible candidate for heavy fermion behaviour. De Haas-van Alphen oscillations are seen once the antiferromagnetic phase is suppressed, and comparable frequencies of oscillation are measured in the non-magnetic analogue LaZn 11, although with relatively smaller effective masses. GGA+ U <b>calculations,</b> once magnetic <b>breakdown</b> is considered, match well the measured frequencies, confirming CeZn 11 to be a localised moment system with the 4 f electron well below the Fermi level.

Low temperature de Haas-van Alphen measurements find multiple domains of a quasi-two dimensional Fermi surface, no longer perpendicular to the lattice planes.

40|$|Green {{chemistry}} {{concerns the}} scientific disciplines that support sustainability as their zenith. Sustainability has both temporal and spacial dimensions. The {{addition of the}} spacial dimension to it has significantly enhanced its visibility and horizon. Green chemistry, as an important subset of sustainability, radiates broadly and this entails a pursuer to choose their spectrum of interest. Therefore, I defined the technical domain of green chemistry from my perspective. Through projecting green chemistry onto the primary basis composed by the principle domain defined by Prof. Anastas and challenges domain interpreted by Prof. Collins and the technical domain by my definition, I mapped out my green chemistry trajectory. In a word, my Ph. D. training can be summarized as a research journey of combating persistent organic pollutants, characterizing the electronic signature of catalysts for renewable energy generation and catalytically oxidizing active pharmaceutical ingredients and hydrocarbons via a combinatorial avenues of computation, analysis and scientific inference. In view of the problem space of green chemistry, seeking renewable energies and eliminating persistent, disrupting or toxic compounds appear on the higher levels according to Prof. Collins. I attempted to tackle all the four problems to certain degrees during my Ph. D. Energy has propelled the engine of human civilization for hundreds of years. Today, the fossil fuels, the natural reserves we rely upon in the past, have approached their limit. More significantly, their continuing use shadows the sustainable future of human beings {{as well as the}} lives of all forms on this planet. An urgent need horizons for better ways to capture and convert solar energy to carbon neutral forms of chemical energy. The lesson from photosynthesis provides a promising answer — water splitting. To mimic this process, developing catalysts for water cleavage becomes the central theme. Among all the earth abundant and inexpensive elements, Co stands out for its high efficiency and dual capability of water reduction and oxidation. Between the two, water oxidation presents the major challenge. Co(IV) was shown to be the active intermediate in this chemical conversion. This highlights the importance of precise characterization of the electronic structure Co containing catalysts. To this end, I combined the spectroscopic information and DFT calculation to clarify the literature ambiguity in the diagnosis of Co containing complexes, and theoretically projects the avenue to acquire a Co(IV) electronic state in coordination complexes. The study of eliminating persistent organic pollutants was performed in the United Nations in the summer 2011. Apart from a technical summary of my research, I also identified two important causes that impasse on many environmental issues between nations. This signifies a global leadership that can unify and usher the international strength toward the sustainable summit. The research experience in the United Nations showed hydrocarbons and their halogenated derivatives are very resistant to natural attenuation. Then I started my fervent pursuit of hydrocarbon hydroxylation study via theoretical modeling. Comparing theoretical with experimental studies, the reaction rates of [FeV(O) (B*) ]– 1 with ethylbenzene (EtBZ) and its isotope labeled species EtBZ-d 10 differ in three respects: (i) the initial[FeV(O) (B*) ]– 1 decay rate for the substrate EtBZ-d 10 is slower than that for EtBZ, (ii) the slope of the ln (k/T) vs. 1 /T plot of EtBZ-d 10 is smaller than that for EtBZ over the experimental temperature range, and (iii) the extrapolated tangents of the kinetic curves give a large, negative intercept difference, Int(EtBZ) - Int(EtBZ-d 10) 3 ̆c 0 at the limit 1 /T → 0. Theoretical analysis, based on density functional theory calculations of thermodynamic parameters of the reaction species and Bell’s model for tunneling through quadratic barriers, shows that (i) and (ii) result from isotope-induced changes in both the zero-point energies and nuclear tunneling, whereas (iii) is exclusively an isotope mass effect on tunneling. The research result points out nuclear tunneling has a significant contribution to the hydrocarbon hydroxylation process. A theoretical model was proposed {{that can be used to}} predict absolute rate constants outside the experimental fathomable range In addition to persistent molecules, endocrine disrupting chemicals also deserve special attention. Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) have been recognized as a hot-spot environmental pollutants largely due to their high disrupting potency. These anthropocentric synthetics compounds are mostly designed to aim at evolutionarily conserved targets to trigger biological responses at minute levels and optimized for extra degradation resistance for stable shelf lives. All these therapeutic benefits translate into ecotoxicity concerns when the parent compounds or their metabolites are released to the environment. A large body of literature has linked the exposure to APIs to Biological disasters. Under such a context, I applied TAML activators to treat to highly prescribed antidepressant drugs, Zoloft and Prozaic. The API for each is sertraline and fluoxetine. In the sertraline degradation study, I demonstrated that TAML activators at nanomolar concentrations in water activate hydrogen peroxide to rapidly degrade this persistent API. While all the API is readily consumed, degradation slows significantly at one intermediate, sertraline ketone. The process occurs from neutral to basic pH. The pathway has been characterized through four early intermediates which reflect the metabolism of sertraline, providing further evidence that TAML activator/peroxide reactive intermediates mimic those of cytochrome P 450 enzymes. TAML catalysts have been designed to exhibit considerable variability in reactivity and this provides an excellent tool for observing degradation intermediates of widely differing stabilities. Two elusive, hydrolytically sensitive intermediates and likely human metabolites, sertraline imine and N-desmethylsertraline imine, could be identified only by using a fast-acting catalyst. The more stable intermediates and known human metabolites, desmethylsertraline and sertraline ketone, were most easily detected and studied using a slow-acting catalyst. The resistance of sertraline ketone to aggressive TAML activator/ peroxide treatment marks it as likely to be environmentally persistent and signals that its environmental effects are important components of the full implications of sertraline use. Fluoxetine, represents the first member of the serotonin receptor reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) family and is one of the most successful among all members. Its top prescription record among SSRIs and extra stability leads to prevalent occurrence in the environment. Environmental studies showed that FLX can be toxic to aquatic species at trace level of exposure and disruptive to their neurosystems. Therefore, it is urgent to seek an environmentally friendly solution to diminish the harm FLX can potentially bring to the environment. Treatment with TAML activators and hydrogen peroxide, fluoxetine was shown to be rapidly degraded to harmless endpoints. An elusive intermediate along the degradation pathway was proposed and its fleet fate was studied using DFT <b>calculations.</b> The cascade <b>breakdown</b> feature of FLX under TAML®/H 2 O 2 treatment inspires green pharmaceutical design...|$|R
