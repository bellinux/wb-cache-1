5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a trust created where a <b>creditor</b> has lent {{money to a}} debtor for a {{particular}} purpose. In {{the event that the}} debtor uses the money for any other purpose, it is held on trust for the <b>creditor.</b> Any inappropriately spent money can then be traced, and returned to the creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can be traced back further. There has been much academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E

5|$|Due to the Panic of 1819, many {{citizens}} in Kentucky fell deep into debt and began petitioning the legislature for help. The state's politicians {{split into two}} factions. Those who advocated for measures that were more favorable to debtors were dubbed the Relief faction while those who insisted on sound money principles and the strict adherence to the obligation of contracts were called the Anti-Relief faction. In 1820, a pro-relief measure passed the General Assembly providing debtors a one-year stay on the collection of their debts if the <b>creditor</b> would accept payment in devalued notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth or a two-year stay if the <b>creditor</b> demanded payment in sound money.

5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease.

Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or <b>creditor)</b> in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E

Under the Insolvent Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14days by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed £20, but if a <b>creditor</b> objected they had to stay inside. Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.|$|E

Author analyses corporate restructuring procedure with special emphasis on legal relationships between the distressed company that is being restructured and its <b>creditors</b> also among <b>creditors</b> themselves. According to the laws of Lithuania and Lithuanian case law the procedure of restructuring is aimed not only at the preservation of particular company but also at satisfying interests of the company’s <b>creditors.</b> Due to these reasons there are many real life situations where an entity undergoing restructuring process is directly or indirectly related to its <b>creditors.</b> If related <b>creditors</b> hold majority of the claims against the company that is being restructured they also have majority votes during the meetings of the <b>creditors.</b> Therefore, related <b>creditors</b> have a dominant influence over the restructuring procedure and such restructuring procedure is being controlled by them. A problem, whether a controlled restructuring procedure negatively affects the rights of other <b>creditors</b> who are not related to the distressed company and whether it allows abusive behavior of related <b>creditors</b> arises. To solve this problem author analyses various conflicting situations between the company that is being restructured and its <b>creditors,</b> discusses the cases where related <b>creditors</b> are abusing their rights, describes different types of corporate <b>creditors.</b> The article also analyses and discusses provisions of the Restructuring Law of the Republic of Lithuania and decisions of the Lithuanian courts regarding the rights and duties of the <b>creditors</b> in the restructuring process. Taking into account all the arising legal issues and possible legal inefficiencies the article concludes that during the restructuring the rights of related <b>creditors</b> should be subject to special treatment if the interests of all the <b>creditors</b> of the company undergoing restructuring procedure are to be protected equally...|$|R
