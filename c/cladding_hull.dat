[1, 2] The head-end process of the pyroprocessing under development at KAERI includes disassembly and oxidative decladding steps, where <b>cladding</b> <b>hull</b> wastes are generated from the fuel rods. The hull wastes are presumably categorized into high-level wastes (HLW) due to traces of SNF residue and fission products that are implemented into the inner surface of the hulls. Thus, the reduction of the amount of HLW {{will be one of the}} key issues for the waste management of the pyroprocess. This study demonstrates the electrorefining process, which is able to recover Zr, which is a major component of the hull wastes such as Zircaloy- 4 or Zirlo. Electrochemical behaviors of Zr in LiCl-KCl molten salts are examined using cyclic voltammetries and chronoamperometries. An anhydrous LiCl-KCl eutectic (99. 99 % purity, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the electrolyte at 500 °C by adding 4 wt % ZrCl 4 for Zr electrorefining. All the experiments were performed in an Ar-purging glove box, where the oxygen and moisture are controlled below 5 ppm. To examine the electrochemical behavior of Zr, cyclic voltammetries and chronoamperometries were performed using a pure Zr rod as an anode, a tungsten wire cathode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Subsequently, the Zr anode was replaced with Zircaloy- 4 hulls to recover Zr by electrorefining. The Zr deposits were characterized by SEM-EDX, XRD, and ICP-AES. Figure 1 shows cyclic voltammograms of tungsten wire cathodes in LiCl-KCl molten salts at 500 °C. For Zr rod anodes in the absence of ZrCl 4, the residual current was less than 0. 4 mA with no apparent anodic and cathodic reactions associated with salt components within the potential range of- 0. 2 V to- 1. 4 V.

40|$|Metallic {{waste is}} a {{residual}} of the electrometallurgical {{treatment of the}} Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II) spent fuel. The treatment is based on electrorefining the fuel in molten salt, and currently it remains in the demonstration phase at the Fuel Conditioning Facility (FCF) at Argonne National Laboratory-West (ANL-W). A reference metallic waste form is produced by mixing 15 % zirconium with the stainless steel <b>cladding</b> <b>hulls,</b> which remain in the fuel dissolution baskets (FDB's) after electrorefining, to form a metal alloy.

40|$|Pyrochemical {{processing}} {{plays an}} important role in the development of next generation nuclear reactors and closed nuclear fuel cycle technology. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has implemented a pyrochemical process for the treatment of sodium-bonded spent fuel from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II). A successful demonstration of the technology was performed from 1996 to 1999 for the Department of Energy (DOE) [1]. Processing of the spent fuel and associated research and development activities have been integrated into DOE’s Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiatives (AFCI) program since 2003. Electrorefining can be considered to be the signature or central technology for pyrochemical processing. In order to assess the efficiencies involved in the electrorefining process, an integrated electrorefining efficiency test was performed in the Mk-IV electrorefiner. This paper summarizes the observations and results obtained from the test. EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS The primary goal of the integrated processing efficiency test is to demonstrate the integrated actinide dissolution and recovery efficiencies typical for the fixed operating parameters that have been applied to Mk-IV electrorefiner (ER) and cathode processor (CP) to treat spent EBR-II driver fuel during the last three years. The findings are of importance for scaling-up the pyroprocess to recover and recycle valuable actinides from spent nuclear fuel. The test was performed in the Mk-IV electrorefiner. The ER is located in the hot cell of the Fuel Conditioning Facility at the Materials and Fuels Complex. Descriptions of the major components of the ER and the process in general have been provided elsewhere [2]. Salt and cadmium levels were measured, and multiple samples were obtained prior to performing the integrated test to establish an ER baseline for assessing the test results. The test consisted of four electrorefining batches of spent driver fuel with approximately 50 kg heavy metal. Typically, three to four ER runs are required to complete a batch. Fig. 1 shows pictures of the cathodes produced by three electrorefining runs during the second batch. The cathode No. 3 in the figure has clearly different morphology than that of the first two. The cathodes produced by the other three batches have the similar morphology as those pictured. The first and second cathodes are ordinary uranium dendrite, and the third and fourth cathode show typically high Zr content morphology [3]. The end-point for each batch was determined by weighing each anode basket and assuring a net residue mass being equal or less than 3. 0 kg. The 3. 0 kg residue included any un-dissolved fuel constituents and adhering salt. Previous operating experience has shown that uranium dissolution in excess of 99. 7 wt% was achieved when using this established end-point. <b>Cladding</b> <b>hull</b> samples were taken from each basket after it was removed from the ER. The actinide dissolution efficiency will be evaluated when the analytical results become available.

40|$|The {{reprocessing}} {{of commercial}} {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) generates a Zircaloy <b>cladding</b> <b>hull</b> waste which requires disposal as a high level waste in the geologic repository. The hulls are primarily contaminated with fission products and actinides from the fuel. During fuel irradiation, these contaminants are deposited in {{a thin layer of}} zirconium oxide (ZrO{sub 2 }) which forms on the cladding surface at the elevated temperatures present in a nuclear reactor. Therefore, if the hulls are treated to remove the ZrO{sub 2 } layer, a majority of the contamination will be removed and the hulls could potentially meet acceptance criteria for disposal as a low level waste (LLW). Discard of the hulls as a LLW would result in significant savings due to the high costs associated with geologic disposal. To assess the feasibility of decontaminating spent fuel cladding hulls, two treatment processes developed for dissolving fuels containing zirconium (Zr) metal or alloys were evaluated. Small-scale dissolution experiments were performed using the ZIRFLEX process which employs a boiling ammonium fluoride (NH{sub 4 }F) /ammonium nitrate (NH{sub 4 }NO{sub 3 }) solution to dissolve Zr or Zircaloy cladding and a hydrofluoric acid (HF) process developed for complete dissolution of Zr-containing fuels. The feasibility experiments were performed using Zircaloy- 4 metal coupons which were electrochemically oxidized to produce a thin ZrO{sub 2 } layer on the surface. Once the oxide layer was in place, the ease of removing the layer using methods based on the two processes was evaluated. The ZIRFLEX and HF dissolution processes were both successful in removing a 0. 2 mm (thick) oxide layer from Zircaloy- 4 coupons. Although the ZIRFLEX process was effective in removing the oxide layer, two potential shortcomings were identified. The formation of ammonium hexafluorozirconate ((NH{sub 4 }) {sub 2 }ZrF{sub 6 }) on the metal surface prior to dissolution in the bulk solution could hinder the decontamination process by obstructing the removal of contamination. The thermal decomposition of this material is also undesirable if the cladding hulls are melted for volume reduction or to produce waste forms. Handling and disposal of the corrosive off-gas stream and ZrO{sub 2 }-containing dross must be addressed. The stability of Zr{sup 4 +} in the NHF{sub 4 }/NH{sub 4 }NO{sub 3 } solution is also a concern. Precipitation of ammonium zirconium fluorides upon cooling of the dissolving solution was observed in the feasibility experiments. Precipitation of the solids was attributed to the high fluoride to Zr ratios used in the experiments. The solubility of Zr{sup 4 +} in NH{sub 4 }F solutions decreases as the free fluoride concentration increases. The removal of the ZrO{sub 2 } layer from Zircaloy- 4 coupons with HF showed a strong dependence on both the concentration and temperature. Very rapid dissolution of the oxide layer and significant amounts of metal was observed in experiments using HF concentrations {ge} 2. 5 M. Treatment of the coupons using HF concentrations {le} 1. 0 M was very effective in removing the oxide layer. The most effective conditions resulted in dissolution rates which were less than approximately 2 mg/cm{sup 2 }-min. With dissolution rates in this range, uniform removal of the oxide layer was obtained and a minimal amount of Zircaloy metal was dissolved. Future HF dissolution studies should focus on the decontamination of actual spent fuel cladding hulls to determine if the treated hulls meet criteria for disposal as a LLW...|$|E

The initial demonstration {{of this process}} is being conducted on U-Zr and U-Pu-Zr alloy fuel elements irradiated in the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II). The electrometallurgical treatment process extracts usable uranium from irradiated fuel elements and places residual fission products, actinides, process Zr, and <b>cladding</b> <b>hulls</b> (small segments of tubing) into two waste forms [...] a ceramic and a metal alloy. The metal waste form will contain the <b>cladding</b> <b>hulls,</b> Zr, and noble metal fission products, and it will be disposed of in a geologic repository.

This report deals with the condition of the cladding, which will make up a large fraction of the metal waste form, after irradiation in EBR-II and before insertion into the electrorefiner.

40|$|A {{process for}} {{recycling}} {{spent nuclear fuel}} cladding, a zirconium alloy (Zircaloy), into a metal powder {{that may be used}} for advanced nuclear fuel applications, was investigated to determine if it is a viable strategy. The process begins with hydriding the Zircaloy <b>cladding</b> <b>hulls</b> after the spent nuclear fuel has been dissolved from the cladding. The addition of hydrogen atoms to the zirconium matrix stresses the lattice and forms brittle zirconium hydride, which is easily pulverized into a powder. The dehydriding process removes hydrogen by heating the powder in a vacuum, resulting in a zirconium metal powder. The two main objectives of this research are to investigate the dehydriding process and to design, build and demonstrate a specialized piece of equipment to process the zirconium from <b>cladding</b> <b>hulls</b> to metal powder without intermediate handling. The hydriding process (known from literature) took place in a 95 percent argon - 5 percent hydrogen atmosphere at 500 degrees C while the dehydriding process conditions were researched with a Thermogavimetric Analyzer (TGA). Data from the TGA showed the dehydriding process requires vacuum conditions (~ 0. 001 bar) and 800 degrees C environment to decompose the zirconium hydride. Zirconium metal powder was created in two separate experiments with different milling times, 45 minutes (coarse powder) and 12 hours (fine powder). Both powders were analyzed by three separate analytical methods, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), size characterization and digital micrographs. XRD analysis proved that the process produced a zirconium metal. Additionally, visual observations of the samples silvery color confirmed the presence of zirconium metal. The presence on zirconium metal in the two samples confirmed the operation of the hydriding / milling / hydriding machine. Further refining of the hydride / milling / dehydride machine could make this process commercially favorable when compared to the high cost of storing nuclear waste and its components.

While the metal waste cannot be readily reduced, there are viable routes towards minimizing the ceramic waste. Fission products that generate high amounts of heat, such as Cs and Sr, can be separated from other active metal fission products and placed into short-term, shallow disposal. The remaining active metal fission products can be concentrated into the ceramic waste form using an ion exchange process. It has been estimated that ion exchange can reduce ceramic high-level waste quantities by as much as a factor of 3 relative to throw-away technology...|$|R

The frames included integral iron cross beams for the decks, with no transverse wood timbers as used on the Monitor. Her bow and stern sections were flooding spaces to allow raising and lowering her waterline.|$|R
40|$|For {{approximately}} 10 years, Argonne National Laboratory {{was developed}} a fast reactor fuel cycle based on dry processing. When the US fast reactor program was canceled in 1994, the fuel processing technology, called the electrometallurgical technique, was adapted for treating unstable {{spent nuclear fuel}} for disposal. While this technique, which involves electrorefining fuel in a molten salt bath, is being developed for several different fuel categories, its initial application is for sodium-bonded metallic spent fuel. In June 1996, the Department of Energy (DOE) approved a radiation demonstration program in which 100 spent driver assemblies and 25 spent blanket assemblies from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) will be treated over a three-year period. This demonstrated will provide data that address issues in the National Research Council`s evaluation of the technology. The planned operations will neutralize the reactive component (elemental sodium) in the fuel and produce a low enriched uranium product, a ceramic waste and a metal waste. The fission products and transuranium elements, which accumulate in the electrorefining salt, will be stabilized in the glass-bonded ceramic waste form. The stainless steel <b>cladding</b> <b>hulls,</b> noble metal fission products, and insoluble residues from the process will be stabilized in a stainless steel/zirconium alloy. Upon completion of a successful demonstration and additional environmental evaluation, the current plans are to process {{the remainder of the}} DOE sodium bonded fuel...|$|R
40|$|A {{metallic}} waste form (MWF) {{will be used}} to immobilize contaminated <b>cladding</b> <b>hulls</b> recovered after electrometallurgical {{treatment of}} spent sodium-bonded nuclear fuel from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II). Tests were conducted to determine if the high-level waste (HLW) glass degradation model developed for total system performance assessment (TSPA) calculations for the Yucca Mountain repository system can be used to represent the degradation of disposed MWF. Static tests were conducted at 50, 70, and 90 C with monolithic samples of MWF in pH buffer solutions spiked with NaCl at a MWF surface-to-solution volume ratio of about 200 m{sup - 1 }. Test specimens were prepared from a surrogate MWF ingot containing about 10 mass% U. Solutions were exchanged after 14, 28, and 70 days. The cumulative amount of U released into solution through 70 days was used to calculate the MWF degradation rate for each test condition. The rate was independent of temperature. The rate was highest in acidic solutions, lowest in neutral solutions, and intermediate in alkaline solutions. The uranium release rate from a breached canister, which is the product of the MWF degradation rate and the surface area of two MWF ingots in a canister, was compared with the release rate calculated with the HLW glass degradation model for a glass log at the same temperature and pH values. The uranium release rates measured for MWF are less than the degradation rates calculated for HLW glass (compared on a mass per time basis) ...|$|R
40|$|An electrometallurgical {{treatment}} {{process has}} been developed by Argonne National Laboratory to convert various types of spent nuclear fuels into stable storage forms and waste forms for repository disposal. The first application of this process will be to treat spent fuel alloys from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II. Three distinct product streams emanate from the electrorefining process: (1) refined uranium; (2) fission products and actinides extracted from the electrolyte salt that are processed into a mineral waste form; and (3) metallic wastes left behind {{at the completion of}} the electrorefining step. The third product stream (i. e., the metal waste stream) {{is the subject of this}} paper. The metal waste stream contains components of the chopped spent fuel that are unaffected by the electrorefining process because of their electrochemically ``noble`` nature; this includes the <b>cladding</b> <b>hulls,</b> noble metal fission products (NMFP), and, in specific cases, zirconium from metal fuel alloys. The selected method for the consolidation and stabilization of the metal waste stream is melting and casting into a uniform, corrosion-resistant alloy. The waste form casting process will be carried out in a controlled-atmosphere furnace at high temperatures with a molten salt flux. Spent fuels with both stainless steel and Zircaloy cladding are being evaluated for treatment; thus, stainless steel-rich and Zircaloy-rich waste forms are being developed. Although the primary disposition option for the actinides is the mineral waste form, the concept of incorporating the TRU-bearing product into the metal waste form has enough potential to warrant investigation...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissolution}} and radionuclide release {{behavior of}} spent fuel in groundwater is being studied by the Nevada Nuclear Waste Storage Investigations (NNWSI) Project. Two bare spent fuel specimens plus the empty <b>cladding</b> <b>hulls</b> {{were tested in}} NNWSI J- 13 well water in unsealed fused silica vessels under ambient hot cell air conditions (25 {degree}C) in the currently reported tests. One of the specimens was prepared from a rod irradiated in the H. B. Robinson Unit 2 reactor and the other from a rod irradiated in the Turkey Point Unit 3 reactor. Results indicate that most radionuclides of interest fall into three groups for release modeling. The first group principally includes the actinides (U, Np, Pu, Am, and Cm), all of which reached solubility-limited concentrations that were orders of magnitude below those necessary to meet the NRC 10 CFR 60. 113 release limits for any realistic water flux predicted for the Yucca Mountain repository site. The second group is nuclides of soluble elements such as Cs, Tc, and I, for which release rates {{do not appear to}} be solubility-limited and may depend on the dissolution rate of fuel. In later test cycles, {sup 137 }Cs, {sup 90 }Sr, {sup 99 }Tc, and {sup 129 }I were continuously released at rates between about 5 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 5 } and 1 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 4 } of inventory per year. The third group is radionuclides that may be transported in the vapor phase, of which {sup 14 }C is of primary concern.

40|$|AbstractProcess {{development}} {{studies are}} {{being done to}} recover and reuse zirconium from used nuclear fuel (UNF) zirconium alloy cladding. This {{has been shown to}} be economically viable and is a major initiative in waste reduction. The studies have included recovery processes based on dry pyrochemical iodination, chlorination, and hydrochlorination. Chlorination, using either or both chlorine and hydrogen chloride, was shown to provide better performance and is more compatible for interfacing with existing industrial chlorination processes used for fuel rod cladding manufacture from natural zirconium. The chlorination recovery process could be used for chemical decladding of intact UNF assemblies or for treatment of empty <b>cladding</b> segment <b>hulls.</b> Future work is planned to optimize recovery process conditions, equipment design, and scale-up operations...|$|R
40|$|During the pyroprocessing of spent {{nuclear fuel}} by {{electrochemical}} techniques, fission products are separated as the fuel is oxidized at the anode and refined uranium is deposited at the cathode. Those fission products that are oxidized into the molten salt electrolyte are considered active metals while {{those that do not}} react are considered noble metals. The primary noble metals encountered during pyroprocessing are molybdenum, zirconium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, and technetium. Pyroprocessing of spent fuel to date has involved two distinctly different electrorefiner designs, in particular the anode to cathode configuration. For one electrorefiner, the anode and cathode collector are horizontally displaced such that uranium is transported across the electrolyte medium. As expected, the noble metal removal from the uranium during refining is very high, typically in excess of 99 %. For the other electrorefiner, the anode and cathode collector are vertically collocated to maximize uranium throughput. This arrangement results in significantly less noble metals removal from the uranium during refining, typically no better than 20 %. In addition to electrorefiner design, operating parameters can also influence the retention of noble metals, albeit at the cost of uranium recovery. Experiments performed to date have shown that as much as 100 % of the noble metals can be retained by the <b>cladding</b> <b>hulls</b> while affecting the uranium recovery by only 6 %. However, it is likely that commercial pyroprocessing of spent fuel will require the uranium recovery to be much closer to 100 %. The above mentioned design and operational issues will likely be driven by the effects of noble metal contamination on fuel fabrication and performance. These effects will be presented in terms of thermal properties (expansion, conductivity, and fusion) and radioactivity considerations. Ultimately, the incorporation of minor amounts of noble metals from pyroprocessing into fast reactor metallic fuel will be shown to be of no consequence to reactor performance...|$|R
40|$|Argonne National Laboratory has {{developed}} an electrometallurgical process for conditioning spent sodium-bonded metallic reactor fuel prior to disposal. A waste stream from this process consists of stainless steel <b>cladding</b> <b>hulls</b> that contain undissolved metal fission products such as Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ag; {{a small amount of}} undissolved actinides (U, Np, Pu) also remains with the hulls. These wastes will be immobilized in a waste form whose baseline composition is stainless steel alloyed with 15 wt% Zr (SS- 15 Zr). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations of simulated metal waste forms (SS- 15 Zr with added actinides) show eutectic intergrowths of iron solid-solution (''steel'') and Fe-Zr-Cr-Ni (''intermetallic'') materials. The actinide elements are almost entirely in the intermetallic materials, where they occur in concentrations as high as 20 at%. Neutron- and electron-diffraction studies of the simulated waste forms show materials with structures similar to those of Fe{sub 2 }Zr and Fe{sub 23 }Zr{sub 6 }. New TEM observations of simulated waste form samples with compositions SS- 15 Zr- 2 Np, SS- 15 Zr- 5 U, SS- 15 Zr- 11 U- 0. 6 Ru- 0. 3 Tc- 0. 1 Pd, and SS- 15 Zr- 10 Pu suggest that the major U- and Pu-bearing phase has a structure {{similar to that of the}} C 15 (cubic, MgCu{sub 2 }-type) polymorph of Fe{sub 2 }Zr. Materials with this structure exhibit significant variability in chemical compositions and actinide concentrations up to 20 at% (normalized so that atomic fractions of Cr, Ni, Fe, and Zr add up to 1). A U-bearing material similar to the C 36 (dihexagonal, MgNi{sub 2 }-type) polymorph of Fe{sub 2 }Zr was also observed. Chemical variability in materials with the C 36 Fe{sub 2 }Zr structure is smaller than in those with the C 15 Fe{sub 2 }Zr structure, and U concentrations are less than 5 at%. Uranium concentrations up to 5 at. % were observed in materials with the Fe{sub 23 }Zr{sub 6 } (cubic, Mn{sub 23 }Th{sub 6 }-type) structure. Microstructures similar to those produced during experimental deformation of Fe- 10 at% Zr alloys were observed in intermetallic materials in all of the simulated waste form samples. Stacking faults and associated dislocations are common in samples with U, but rarely observed in those with Np and Pu, while twins occur in all samples. Previously reported differences in dissolution behavior between samples with different actinides may be related to increased defect-assisted dissolution in samples with U...|$|R
