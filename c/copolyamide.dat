For this purpose, two different types of <b>copolyamides</b> were synthesized: in nylon 12 - 6, the adipic acid residues were partially replaced by cis/trans- 1, 4 -cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (1, 4 -CHDA), whereas in nylon 4 - 14, the 1, 4 -diaminobutane residues were partially substituted with cis/trans- 1, 4 -diaminocyclohexane (1, 4 -DACH). For both systems, increasing the degree of substitution of cycloaliph. residues for linear aliph. residues resulted in a rise of both Tm and Tcr. This points to the isomorphous crystn. of the linear and cycloaliph. residues. In contrast to the use of 1, 4 -DACH as a comonomer, 1, 4 -CHDA residues showed isomerization upon thermal treatment of the polyamides.

The poly(amide acid) s, <b>copoly(amide</b> acid) s, polyimides and copolyimides are {{prepared by the}} reaction of stoichiometric ratios of an aromatic &anhydride with diamines which contain phenylphosphine oxide groups in polar aprotic solvents. Controlled molecular weight oligomeric (amide acid) s and imides can be prepared by offsetting the stoichiometry according to the Carothers equation using excess diamine and endcapping with aromatic anhydrides. The polyimide materials can be processed into various material forms such as thin films, fibers, foams, threads, adhesive film, coatings, dry powders, and fiber coated prepreg, and uses include thin film membranes on antennas, second-surface mirrors, thermal optical coatings, and multilayer thermal insulation (MLI) blanket materials...|$|E
40|$|Solid state {{polymerization}} (SSP) {{starting from}} polyhexamethyleneadipamide (PA 6, 6) precursors was {{studied in the}} temperature range of 160 - 200 degrees C in a solid bed reactor. Process parameters, such as temperature, time and inert gas flow rate were investigated, meanwhile emphasis was given {{on the effect of}} a dyeability modifier (sodium 5 -sulfoisophthalic acid, NaSIPA) on the SSP rate, due to the importance of the pertinent sulfonated ionomers in the polyamide industry. Under the specific experimental conditions, the copolyamides with NaSIPA exhibited lower SSP rates than PA 6, 6 homopolymer and their retarding behavior was found proportional to the comonomer content. A possible retardation mechanism related to the NaSIPA ionic species has been suggested and verified through modifying the kinetics so as to describe and predict the <b>copolyamide</b> SSP performance.

40|$|Novel copoly(imide siloxane) s were {{synthesized}} from {{commercially available}} aminopropyl terminated siloxane oligomers, aromatic dianhydrides, and diamines. This synthetic approach produced copolymers with well-defined siloxane blocks linked with imide units {{in a random}} fashion. The <b>copoly(amide</b> acid) s were characterized by solution viscosity and subsequently used to cast thin films followed by thermal imidization in an inert atmosphere. Thin films were characterized using contact angle goniometry, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, confocal and optical microscopy, and tensile testing. Adhesion of micronsized particles was determined quantitatively using a sonication device. The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) moieties lowered the copolymer surface energy due to migration of siloxane moieties to the film s surface, resulting in a notable reduction in particle adhesion. A further reduction in particle adhesion was achieved by introducing topographical features {{on a scale of}} several to tens of microns by a laser ablation technique...|$|E
40|$|Blends of {{aliphatic}} polyamide PA 46 and {{aromatic polyamide}} PA 61 {{were obtained by}} coprecipitation from a common solvent and by melt mixing using a mini-extruder. The polyamides {{were found to be}} fully miscible by both blending methods. However, there are large differences in crystallization and melting behaviour when the blends obtained by the two methods of blending are compared to each other. This can be ascribed to the occurrence of transamidation processes during the melt mixing of the homopolyamides resulting in the formation of block <b>copolyamides</b> composed of crystallizable and non-crystallizable segments. The extent of the transreaction processes is dominated by the extrusion temperature and the extrusion lime. Increasing one of these processing parameters will enhance the transamidation reactions and shorten the crystallizable segment lengths. This will be reflected in a decreasing crystallization rate and lower melting points of the melt-mixed blends. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Copolyamides</b> with anthrazoline {{units in}} the {{backbone}} (coPA) were synthesized and dense nonporous films were prepared by solvent evaporation. Glass transition temperature, density, and fractional free volume were determined for the dense nonporous films composed of polyamide and two of its copolymers containing 20 and 30 mol % anthrazoline {{units in the}} backbone. Transport properties of the polymer films were estimated by sorption and pervaporation tests toward methanol, toluene, and their mixtures. An increase in anthrazoline fragments content leads to an increasing degree of methanol sorption but to a decreasing degree of toluene sorption. Pervaporation of a methanol–toluene mixture was studied {{over a wide range}} of feed concentration (10 – 90 wt % methanol). Maximal separation factor was observed for coPA- 20 containing 20 mol % fragments with anthrazoline units; maximal total flux was observed for coPA- 30 with the highest fractional free volume...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of polyamide 46 /polyamide 6 I copolymers obtained by {{reaction in the}} molten state is analyzed {{as a function of}} the extrusion time, the extrusion temperature, and the overall blend composition by C- 13 NMR. The degree of transamidation, the degree of randomness, and the number-average block length of the copolymers are calculated using the method for a four-component polyamide system. It is shown that the transamidation processes are occurring very fast during the first period of melt-mixing but are slowing down at longer extrusion times. High extrusion temperatures affect the transamidation processes in an increasing way. From C- 13 NMR experiments on PA 46 /PA 6 I copolymers with different compositions, differences in reactivities are observed. The change of the molecular {{structure of}} the <b>copolyamides</b> {{as a function of the}} processing conditions and the overall blend composition strongly affects their crystallization behavior. status: publishe...|$|R
