40|$|We {{present an}} {{optimization}} algorithm {{to determine a}} partition of the convex hull of a finite set of ponts in the plane.

A convex partition with respect to S, is a cell complex with <b>corners</b> <b>at</b> <b>points</b> from S, that partitions the convex hull of S into convex polygonal cells so that no cell has a point from S in its interior. We use convex K-gon to denote a convex polygon of non-zero area with at most K sides.
