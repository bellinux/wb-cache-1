30|$|Our {{studies were}} {{originally}} {{designed for the}} detection of ambient air pollution[1]. It appears, however, that the method is also suitable for indicating climatic changes. Recently, lichen mappings confirming to the ‘immission guideline’ and - simultaneously – to the ‘climate directive’ were carried out in Bavaria[50]. It arose that the method following the climate directive provided better correlations of the epiphytic lichen composition and climate parameters than the data confirming to the immission guideline. This is explained by the greater variability and the number of examined trees and by a larger <b>examination</b> <b>area</b> on the tree in the climate directive. As our study was conducted with the small monitoring quadrat (Figure 2), it can be assumed that the results would have been even clearer if it had been worked according to the specifications of the climate directive.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{likelihood}} of {{physical and mental health}} impacts following the unprecedented accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, the Fukushima prefectural government decided to conduct the Fukushima Health Management Survey to assist in the long-term health management of residents. This included thyroid ultrasound examination for all children in Fukushima. For appropriate evaluation of ultrasound screening of the thyroid, {{it is important to understand}} its reference data of thyroid findings in children in general. In order to analyze the frequencies of specific thyroid findings, we conducted ultrasound screening of the thyroid by the same procedures as used in Fukushima in 4, 365 children, aged 3 to 18 years, from three Japanese prefectures. Overall, thyroid cysts were identified in 56. 88 % and thyroid nodules in 1. 65 % of the participants. Thyroid cysts and nodules with a maximum diameter of more than 5 mm were identified in 4. 58 % and 1. 01 %, respectively, and age-adjusted prevalences were 3. 82 % and 0. 99 %, respectively. Although the prevalence of cysts and nodules varied among the <b>examination</b> <b>areas,</b> no significant differences were observed among the three <b>examination</b> <b>areas</b> in the prevalence of cysts and nodules with a maximum diameter of more than 5 mm. Also, the prevalence of thyroid cysts and nodules, especially those with a maximum diameter of more than 5 mm, significantly increased with age, and showed a female predominance. We also identified ectopic thymus (1. 95 %), diffuse goiter (1. 40 %), ultimobranchial body (0. 73 %), lymph node swelling (0. 21 %) and thyroid agenesis (0. 05 %). This is the first ultrasound description of the age-adjusted prevalence of thyroid cysts and nodules, or of the prevalence of abnormalities other than cysts and nodules, such as ectopic thymus, in relation to age, in the general Japanese child population. We contend that this can provide relevant information for the Fukushima Health Management Survey and future population studies...|$|R

Calibrated digital electronic thermometers were used to assess OT and RT, while TMT was measured using an infrared detection device and microprocessor. Recordings were made at baseline and after 15 and 20 minutes of exposure to either warm (35 &deg;C) or cool (18. 3 &deg;C) environmental temperatures. Differences were examined for the three temperature sites and times using repeat measures analysis of variance. No significant differences in RT (37. 7 &deg; &plusmn; 0. 3 &deg;C; mean &plusmn; SD) were observed at any time. Both OT (+ 0. 5 &deg;C) and TMT (+ 0. 7 &deg;C) were significantly changed during warm, but not cool exposure, compared to baseline conditions.
