40|$|The oxidn. {{of carbon}} black on an Al 2 O 3 -supported K-Cu-V {{catalyst}} was studied {{in order to}} characterize the mechanism of carbon gasification, which {{is the basis of}} a <b>catalytic</b> <b>post-combustion</b> treatment for removal of particulates in flue gases from fuel oil-fired power plants. In the presence of catalyst the temps. of carbon black burnoff were strongly lowered. Catalyst characterization suggested that a redox mechanism is responsible for the strong activity of the catalyst. Measurements of temp. -programmed desorption of carbon oxides gave evidence that the energy of desorption of the carbon-oxygen surface complexes was dramatically modified by the presence of catalyst...|$|E
