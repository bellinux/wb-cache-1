However, growth was steady after 1934, with profits of £23,000, £38,000, £54,000 and then a large jump to £139,000 in 1938. By 1939 the Redman operation alone employed 300 people, compared to around 30 in 1920. Motor industry expansion assisted in this growth, with Ford becoming a customer and Gabriel setting up a new machine tool division at Coventry Road, South Yardley, Birmingham, in 1938 to give easy access for the industry's centre, but rearmament was the most significant factor.|$|E

Such a model might be appropriate {{for a company that}} specializes in inventions and discoveries, which pays costs continuously and has occasional profits. The objective is to maximize the expected present value of the dividends minus the discounted costs of <b>capital</b> <b>injections.</b> This paper can be considered as an extension of Yao et al.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} optimisation problems of {{an insurance company}} whose risk reserve process follows the settings of the classical risk model. The insurer has the possibility to control its surplus process by paying dividends to the shareholders. Furthermore, the shareholders are allowed to make <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> such that the surplus process stays nonnegative. A control strategy describes the decision on the times {{and the amount of}} the dividend payments and the <b>capital</b> <b>injections.</b> To measure the risk associated with a control strategy, {{we consider}} the value of the expected discounted dividends minus the penalised expected discounted <b>capital</b> <b>injections.</b> Because of the discounting, it can only be optimal to make <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> at times when the reserve would become negative due to a claim occurrence. Our goal is to determine the value function, which is defined as the maximal value over all proper strategies, and to find an optimal strategy which leads to this maximal value. First, we solve the optimisation problem for the classical risk model when the <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> are penalised by some proportional factor greater than one. We show that an optimal strategy exists and is of barrier type, i. e., all the surplus exceeding some barrier level is paid as dividend. In the second part, we extend this model by adding fixed costs incurring any time at which <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> are made. The optimal strategy here is not of barrier type any more, but of band type. That is a strategy where the state space of the surplus process is partitioned into three types of sets where either dividends at the premium rate, or lump sum dividends, or no dividends at all are paid. In the third part, we allow the dynamics of the surplus process to depend on environmental conditions which are modelled by a Markov process. I. e., the frequency of the claim arrivals and the distribution of the claim amounts vary over time depending {{on the state of the}} environment process. We again maximise the difference between the expected discounted dividends and the (proportional) penalised <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> and show that the optimal strategy for any fixed initial environment state is of barrier type with a barrier depending on the initial state. ...|$|R

25|$|In March 1999 Ansett and Air New Zealand became full Star Alliance members. 1999 {{also saw}} {{the start of a}} long and {{confusing}} battle over ownership of Ansett. Ansett remained profitable but was having increasing difficulty in finding a way to rationalise its cost structure, and badly needed a <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> to replace its elderly fleet. Of the two half owners, News Limited was more interested in selling out and investing the proceeds in other industries, while Air New Zealand did not have the funds to spare: with 102 aircraft, nearly 15,000 staff and a turnover of US$2.3 billion (compared with Air New Zealand's 72 aircraft, 9,200 staff and US$1.8 billion turnover) Ansett's need for capital was greater than Air New Zealand's ability to provide it—particularly given the age of Air New Zealand's own fleet.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a risk {{model in which}} deficits after ruin are covered by {{a new type of}} reinsurance contract that provides <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> which depend on a chosen level of retention. To allow the insurance company's survival after ruin, the reinsurer would have to inject capital.
