50|$|The Harwood Bridge was {{completed}} in August 1966, and replaced the last ferry crossing on the state highway system of New South Wales. Prior {{to the opening of}} the bridge, the river crossing was provided by three <b>cable-guided</b> ferries operating in parallel.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cable-guided</b> car {{increases}} {{efficiency in}} underground coal mines. Unmanned vehicle contains storage batteries in side panels for driving traction motors located in wheels. Batteries recharged during inactive periods or slid out as unit {{and replaced by}} fresh battery bank. Onboard generator charges batteries as car operates...|$|R
25|$|The VDOT {{operates}} other toll-free <b>cable-guided</b> ferries: the Merry Point ferry, which {{crosses the}} western end of the Corrotoman River in Lancaster County; the Sunnybank Ferry, crossing the Little Wicomico River in Northumberland County; and the Hatton Ferry, one of the last two poled ferries in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Pikkarala Ferry (Pikkaralan lossi in Finnish) is a single-operator <b>cable-guided</b> ferry {{operating}} across Oulujoki river between Pikkarala and Lapinkangas. The ferry {{route is}} a part of Pikkarala private road. The ferry operates between 08:00—17:00 from Monday to Friday and 08:00—15:00 on Saturdays when traffic so requires. Typically the operating season starts at about mid-May and lasts until about mid-October.|$|R
5000|$|WZ-504 (Type 504) - The troop {{compartment}} {{was replaced}} by a weapons compartment which incorporates an elevatable weapon station armed with four HJ-73 [...] "Red Arrow 73" [...] <b>cable-guided</b> ATGM rail launchers mounted under the roof of the weapons station and equipped with optical sights. The launcher can be retracted into the compartment when not in use. The vehicle carries 16 ATGMs. It never left the prototype stage.|$|R
5000|$|Telescoping holders {{fall into}} two subcategories. The earlier of the {{telescoping}} variety were column-guided variations and were built from 1824. To guide the telescoping walls, or [...] "lifts", they have an external fixed frame, visible at a fixed height at all times. A refinement was the guide frame gas holder, where the heavy columns were replaced a lighter and more extensive framework. Vertical girders (standards) were intersected by horizontal girders and cross-braced. This could be bolted onto an underground or aboveground tank. The Cutler patented guide frame dispensed with the horizontal girders using diagonal triangulated framing instead[...] <b>Cable-guided</b> gas holders, invented by Pease in 1880, had a limited use, but were useful on unstable ground where the rigid systems could buckle and jam the lift.|$|R
50|$|Although it {{was planned}} to {{modernize}} all U.S. Navy ship of this class, only 19 ships were modernized starting with Fiscal Year 1968. The modernization cost between 700,000 and 1,500,000 $ per ship and should {{enable them to}} operate for another ten years. The ships received new aluminum block Waukesha diesel engines and the superstructure was enlarged aft. The UQS-1 sonar was replaced with SQQ-14. Two PAP-104 <b>cable-guided</b> undersea tools were added. Also, two 40hp zodiacs were carried {{for the purpose of}} mooring the new sonar reflectors. Also, a team of mine clearance divers was added. Additional space on the foc'sle was needed for installation of the SQQ-14 cabling so the 40mm Bofors bow gun was replaced with a mount for a twin 20 mm Mk 68 gun.|$|R
5000|$|The Chinese {{developed}} {{a family of}} armored fighting vehicles based on the WZ 501 IFV which includes a nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) reconnaissance vehicle; a battlefield surveillance vehicle; a WZ 502 mortar carrier; a WZ 503 turretless prototype APC with a larger troop compartment and 12.7 mm heavy machine gun; a WZ 504 tank destroyer (about 180 were built), fitted with an elevatable weapon station armed with two or four HJ-73 [...] "Red Arrow 73" [...] <b>cable-guided</b> ATGM rail launchers (the HJ-73 ATGM is a licensed copy of the Soviet 9M14M [...] "Malyutka-M" [...] ATGM); a WZ 505 armored ambulance and a WZ 506 command and staff vehicle (about 90 were built). (See 'The People's Republic of China' section in the BMP-1 variants article for details). The WZ 501 has also been exported to Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Burma and Sri Lanka.|$|R
