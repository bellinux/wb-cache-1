5|$|After {{the success}} of Mayabazar (1957), {{directed}} by Kadiri Venkata Reddy, B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani of Vijaya Vauhini Studios planned to make a contemporary drama. Chakrapani <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> idea about conflict between two older men who are polar opposites: one a debtor evading his creditors, {{and the other a}} wealthy gentleman with an inflated sense of prestige. L. V. Prasad was chosen to direct the film; he, Chakrapani and Vempati Sadasivabrahmam developed a script entitled Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu, after a popular Telugu idiom. It was the only film from Vijaya Vauhini Studios with dialogue written by Sadasivabrahmam.|$|E
5|$|Luscombe Castle is {{a country}} house {{situated}} near the resort town of Dawlish, in the county of Devon in England. Upon purchasing the land at Luscombe in 1797, Charles Hoare demolished the existing house and commissioned architects John Nash and Humphrey Repton to design a new house and gardens at the site. Nash and Repton <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> asymmetrical designed building made from Portland stone, with castellated parapets, turrets and pinnacles to create {{the feel of a}} picturesque castle.|$|E
5|$|Mosley <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{innovative}} way {{to dispose}} of the FIA's involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One. In order to maintain Ecclestone's investment to deliver digital television, he proposed extending Ecclestone's rights for F1 coverage to 100 years from the initial 15, arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti-competition as it was effectively the same as an outright sale. The Commission agreed with his assessment and in the interest of impartiality, Mosley removed himself from the negotiations, which eventually returned around $300 million (£150 million).|$|E

5|$|Nuaym then <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{efficient}} stratagem. He {{first went}} to the Banu Qurayza and warned them about {{the intentions of the}} rest of the Confederacy. If the siege fails, he said, the Confederacy will not be afraid to abandon the Jews, leaving them at the mercy of Muhammad. The Qurayza should thus demand Confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation. This advice touched upon the fears the Qurayza had already harboured.|$|E
5|$|The game's budget {{exceeded}} expectations. The original 15-person development team {{expanded to}} about 100, {{at a cost}} of 20 million złoty. According to Iwiński, content was removed from the game for budgetary reasons but the characters' personalities were retained; however, there was difficulty in translating the game's Polish text into English. Atari agreed to publish the game. After five years of development, The game would bring Wiedźmin to an international audience, and so the company <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> English name: The Witcher. The Witcher was released in 2007 to generally positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Candace {{mentions}} that {{her best friend}} Stacy Hirano had become the president of Uruguay was originally written as a throwaway joke for the episode. During an e-mail exchange between the crew, some crew members were curious about the line and Povenmire <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> entire back story, in which Stacy meets the prince of the country, moves there and, after changing several laws, becomes eligible for the presidency. The staff enjoyed the idea and wrote it down as a possible plot for a future episode.|$|E

5|$|When Kukunoor was {{thinking}} of a character full of disguises, he first <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> old man. When {{the thought of a}} scene with the three major characters dancing in the dunes came up, he realized that an older character could not realistically dance in the desert. He immediately felt that Shreyas Talpade, whom he knew of knowing mimicry, could be used for bahuroopiya. Kukunoor, who worked previously with Girish Karnad, said that he was the strength for the film and added that he found him a good actor and a good human being.|$|E
25|$|Peter Stearns {{played an}} {{important}} part in researching the differences in anger between genders.

25|$|Matthew and Luke both {{wanted to}} present Jesus as {{fulfilling}} prophecies from Hebrew scripture. Both {{were aware of}} prophecies concerning a virgin birth and Bethlehem, and therefore these elements of their stories match. But each author wove these prophecies into an overall narrative in a different way. For example, both authors had to explain how Jesus was born in Bethlehem when {{he was known to}} be from Nazareth (as mentioned in all four gospels)—and each <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> independent explanation.|$|E

He took his inspiration from hang gliders, increasing wing area so that the drag of the wire bracing needed would be reduced. The Gossamer Condor is built around a large wing with a gondola for the pilot underneath and a canard control surface on a fuselage extension in front, and is mostly built of lightweight plastics with aluminum spars.|$|E

The result was the Jester Head. This symbol made its first appearance in the cover artwork of The Jester Race and ever since, the Jester has been featured in various forms somewhere on every studio album that In Flames has released, either as a song title or on the album artwork. The Jester Head is also featured in lots of In Flames' merchandise and has been featured in banners as part of In Flames' live set.|$|E

When Seattle {{filed a lawsuit against}} Major League Baseball over the move of the Seattle Pilots to Milwaukee, Finley and others <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> elaborate shuffle which would move the ailing Chicago White Sox to Seattle. Finley then would move the A's to Chicago, closer to his home in LaPorte, Indiana; and take the White Sox' place at Comiskey Park. The scheme fell through when White Sox owner John Allyn sold the team to another colorful owner, Bill Veeck, who was not interested in leaving Chicago.|$|E

25|$|Two-time runners-up the Royal Challengers Bangalore won six {{of their}} first eight matches with a six-of-six home record. This was {{credited}} to good death-over bowling from Vinay Kumar and prolific and quick run-scoring from captain Virat Kohli, Chris Gayle and AB de Villiers. This included Gayle's score of 175 not out, the highest in Twenty20 cricket. However, their performances were fluctuant. Included was a 130-run victory, two Super Overs and two other matches involving a tight finish. Two-time champions the Chennai Super Kings were similarly dominant, with good batting from captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Michael Hussey and Suresh Raina and an all-round bowling attack. They <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> IPL record-equalling seven-match winning streak, which {{took them to the}} top of the points table.|$|E
25|$|Sun He {{heard that}} Cai Ying (蔡穎), {{a member of}} his {{personal}} staff, enjoyed playing weiqi and that many of Cai Ying's subordinates also picked up the game and {{spent a lot of time}} playing. As he saw that weiqi was an unproductive activity meant to be a hobby or pastime, he became worried that Cai Ying and the others would become complacent and neglect their duties from playing too much weiqi. He thus <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> idea to subtly remind and motivate his subordinates. He called for a meeting and asked them to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of playing weiqi. One of them, Wei Yao (韋曜), went home, wrote an essay on this topic and presented it to Sun He, who had copies of it distributed among his personal staff.|$|E
25|$|While {{the project}} was still in its initial stage of development, bitter {{disagreements}} and quarrels broke out among the scholars {{due to differences in}} opinion. Xu Ci and Hu Qian started making accusations and taking petty revenge against each other. They bickered among themselves and constantly sought opportunities to provoke each other. They also praised themselves and scorned their colleagues. When Liu Bei heard about it, he <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> idea to urge them to put aside their differences and cooperate with each other. He gathered all the officials for a feast and had actors put up a skit parodying the conflict between Xu Ci and Hu Qian, showing how a war of words between them led to them using weapons to attack each other. Despite Liu Bei's efforts, the project ultimately {{turned out to be a}} failure.|$|E
