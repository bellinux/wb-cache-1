5|$|In 1988, the Portland Water Bureau {{expressed}} their {{surprise at the}} cost of running the fountain, which at the time was consuming $34,000 in water and $13,000 in electricity each year. Also in 1988, a 26-year-old Vancouver man was drowned when he attempted to swim through a small water pipe and got wedged under a <b>concrete</b> <b>slab.</b> He was taken to the Oregon Health & Science University and was listed in critical condition. According to Portland police, he had been drinking alcohol.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s the central vault {{ceiling of the}} main {{sanctuary}} cracked, {{and had to be}} repaired. At that time the pulpit was also rebuilt, so that the rabbi and cantor had separate pulpits. Underneath the sanctuary ran an underground stream which would regularly overflow, leading to flooding problems. The flooding was fixed in the 1950s with the installation of check valves, and a <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> floor was installed. Though the intent was to provide usable space in the basement, it was rarely used.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{stations}} Charles Holden {{designed for the}} extension, Arnos Grove was built in a modern European style using brick, {{glass and reinforced concrete}} and basic geometric shapes. A circular drum-like ticket hall of brick and glass panels rises from a low single-storey structure and is capped by a flat <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> roof. The design was inspired by the Stockholm City Library and Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund. The centre of the ticket hall is occupied by a disused ticket office (a passimeter in London Underground parlance) which houses an exhibition on the station and the line.|$|E
40|$|Light weight plastic spheres from {{recycled}} plastics have been {{commonly used in}} the design and construction of lightweight hollow-core <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs.</b> While this approach is regarded as an effective method to reduce the dead load of slabs and to increase the imposed load carrying capacity, limited technical information exists about the benefits of hollow core <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> and their structural performance. A literature review on the engineering databases uncovered some awards and application articles on the technologies, but little analysis about its structural performance can be found. In this paper, Strand 7 Finite Element Analysis in conjunction with Rhinoceros 4 3 D CAD software was used to create composite FEA models of <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs.</b> These composite models were loaded to observe stresses and cracked section behaviour in both hollow-core <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> and solid <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> to determine the relative merits of hollow core <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> over regular solid <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Allied {{air forces}} carried out several bombing raids on Mimoyecques between November 1943 and June 1944 but caused little damage. The bombing {{disrupted}} the construction {{project and the}} initial raids of 5 and 8 November 1943 caused work to be delayed for about a month. The Germans subsequently decided to abandon the western site, where work had not progressed very far, and concentrated on the eastern site. On 6 July 1944 the Royal Air Force began bombing the site with ground-penetrating Tallboy bombs. One Tallboy hit the <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> on top of Drift IV, collapsing the drift. Three others penetrated the tunnels below and substantially damaged the facility, causing several of the galleries to collapse in places.|$|E
5|$|As other {{stations}} Holden designed, Acton Town station {{features a}} tall block-like ticket hall rising above a low horizontal structure housing the station offices and shops. The ticket hall has a projecting London Underground roundel sign over a canopy, the brick {{walls of the}} ticket hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> roof. From the ticket hall enclosed stairs descend to the platforms under integral concrete canopies on paired piers in alternating broad and narrow bay formation. A part of the narrow bays is infilled by kiosks, integral poster boards, roundel signs and fixed seating. The platforms are linked by a secondary bridge at the southern end. Reinforced concrete platform canopies replaced the original timber canopies. Since 17 May 1994, the station has been a Grade II Listed building.|$|E
5|$|Being one of {{the tallest}} {{buildings}} in Singapore in the early 20th century, the Great Southern Hotel was an important landmark of Chinatown. Designed by Swan and Maclaren, the architectural style of the Nam Tin Building {{was that of the}} Modern Movement. The building was designed to be strictly functional. The grey-coloured façade of the Great Southern Hotel seemed to consist only of the bare essentials, with ordinary designs like strong horizontal lines with angular arches and simple cornices. The building was fitted with steel frame windows, with metal railings and grills, which were considered fashionable in the 1930s. The loggia on the uppermost floor was a little lighter in colour with the use of cast iron balustrades and brackets, and there was extensive use of green glass. The building was {{one of the}} first in Singapore to be built as an integral structure of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> and beam with infill brick wall.|$|E

30|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{finite element}} model was developed {{to account for the}} material and geometric nonlinearities in the composite slabs and to investigate the ultimate strength of the continuous composite <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> tested in the laboratory.

40|$|Influence {{of steel}} fibers and fiber-reinforced {{polymers}} {{on the impact}} resistance of one-way <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> Doo-Yeol Yoo and Young-Soo Yoon In this study, to estimate the impact resistance of steel fiber-reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> strengthened with fiber-reinforced polymer sheets, a series of 50 100 350 mm 3 sized slabs with 0. 5 %– 1. 5 % (by volume) of steel fibers and two types of fiber-reinforced polymer sheets were impact-tested using drop-weight impact test machine. From the test results, the maximum impact load, dissipated energy {{and the number of}} drops before failure were all increased, whereas the maximum deflection and support rotation were reduced by strengthening the steel fiber-reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> with externally bonded fiber-reinforced polymer sheets in the tensile zone. It was noticed that the impact resistance of the steel fiber-reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> was substantially improved by externally strengthening the fiber-reinforced polymer sheets. In addition, the dynamic response of the steel fiber-reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> strengthened with fiber-reinforced polymer sheets under a low-velocity impact load was analyzed using explicit code LS-DYNA with strain rate-dependent material models and debonding failure analysis. These numerical analyses were verified by comparing with the experimental results...|$|R
5|$|MD32 was reconstructed and widened from Sykesville to Eldersburg {{starting}} in 1957 and from West Friendship to {{just south of}} Sykesville in 1958. The state highway's bypass of Sykesville was completed in 1963; the old road {{through the center of}} Sykesville became MD851. MD32's new bridge across the Patapsco River was the longest of only three aluminum triangular box beam girder bridges constructed in the United States. The girder system was topped by a <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> deck and underlain with standard concrete abutments and piers and steel bearing pads on which the aluminum girders rested. These bridges, which were designed by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company, were constructed of aluminum due to that metal's light weight but similar strength compared to steel. Many experimental aluminum bridges were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s. Aluminum bridges are rarely constructed because they are much more expensive than steel and concrete bridges.|$|E
5|$|The Winslow Ames House is a {{prefabricated}} modular International Style {{house in}} New London, Connecticut, United States. It {{was designed by}} Robert W. McLaughlin, Jr. and was built in 1933. Winslow Ames, a professor of art history at Connecticut College and the art director of the Lyman Allyn Museum, had the home built after attending the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. Constructed for $7,500, the prefabricated house {{is one of two}} surviving Motohomes produced by McLaughlin's company American Houses Inc. The modular house, comprising three rectangles and a flat roof, was constructed on a <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> with a welded steel framework. It was made with asbestos panels and features a core component that provides the heating and plumbing functions for the house. The other two modules feature two bedrooms and a one-car garage.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} Disneyland's {{opening on}} July 17, 1955, a {{brakeman}} pulled the switch connecting the Disneyland Railroad's main line with a siding at Main Street, U.S.A. Station too soon as the Retlaw 2 freight train on the siding was passing the Retlaw 1 passenger train stopped at the station on the main line. The caboose {{on the end of}} the freight train had not made it fully across the switch when it was pulled, and as a result the caboose's front set of wheels correctly traveled along the siding while the rear set of wheels incorrectly traveled along the main line towards the passenger train, causing the caboose to swing to the side before colliding with a <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> and derailing upon impact. During the ensuing commotion, the erring brakeman, presumably to avoid disciplinary action, quietly left the scene of the accident, exited the park, and was not seen again. No injuries were reported, and by the following year the use of sidings at stations on the DRR's main line came to an end.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} on the {{finite element models}} and test samples of flat reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> of beamless frame under punching by columns of square and rectangular cross-section were shown in this paper. The research technique of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> deflections on finite element models at various loading schemes is given. Taking into consideration these results the optimum variant of load application has been chosen. Procedure and the tests results of experimental samples received, when studying of rigidity of fragments of flat reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> {{by the action of}} punching force, are considered. A comparative analysis of the experimental values of the deflections of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> under punching by column of rectangular section, depending on the ratio of its sides, is completed. The research results allow to expand experimental data base as well as promote perfecting of modern positions in the theory of deformation of reinforced concrete...|$|R
5|$|The bridge's {{fourteen}} spans extended 1,907feet (580m) long. The {{three main}} spans were of deck truss construction while {{all but two}} of the eleven approach spans were steel multi-girder construction, the two exceptions being <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> construction. The piers were not built in the navigation channel; instead, the center span of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119m) channel. The two support piers for the main trusses, each with two load-bearing concrete pylons at either side of the center main span, were located on opposite banks of the river. The center span was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter spans formed by the same main trusses. Each was 266feet (81m) in length, and was connected to the approach spans by a 38foot (11.6m) cantilever. The two main trusses, one on either side, ranged in depth from 60feet (18.3m) above their pier and concrete pylon supports, to 36feet (11m) at midspan on the central span and 30feet (9m) deep at the outer ends of the adjoining spans. At the top of the main trusses were the deck trusses, 12feet (3.6m) in depth and integral with the main trusses. The transverse deck beams, part of the deck truss, rested on top of the main trusses. These deck beams supported longitudinal deck stringers 27inches (69cm) in depth, and reinforced-concrete pavement. The deck was 113ft 4in (34.5m) in breadth and was split longitudinally. It had transverse expansion joints at the centers and ends of each of the three main spans. The roadway deck was approximately 115feet (35m) above the water level.|$|E
