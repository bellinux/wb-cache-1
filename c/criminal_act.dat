5|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court held in Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer) (2002), that a {{statutory}} provision prohibiting prisoners serving {{a sentence of}} two years or more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be {{denied the right to}} vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's <b>criminal</b> <b>act</b> nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.|$|E

However, the genre later experienced a resurgence which included The Warped Ones. The film marked director Koreyoshi Kurahara's first collaboration with screenwriter Nobuo Yamada.

5|$|The Song {{judicial}} system retained {{most of the}} legal code of the earlier Tang dynasty, the basis of traditional Chinese law up until the modern era. Roving sheriffs maintained {{law and order in}} the municipal jurisdictions and occasionally ventured into the countryside. Official magistrates overseeing court cases were not only expected to be well-versed in written law but also to promote morality in society. Magistrates such as the famed Bao Qingtian (999–1062) embodied the upright, moral judge who upheld justice and never {{failed to live up to}} his principles. Song judges specified the guilty person or party in a <b>criminal</b> <b>act</b> and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of caning. A guilty individual or parties brought to court for a criminal or civil offense were not viewed as wholly innocent until proven otherwise, while even accusers were viewed with a high level of suspicion by the judge. Due to costly court expenses and immediate jailing of those accused of criminal offences, people in the Song preferred to settle disputes and quarrels privately, without the court's interference.|$|E

5|$|When Gaveston without {{permission}} returned from exile later the same year, a Baronial council entrusted Pembroke and The Earl of Surrey, {{with the task}} of taking him into custody. This they did on 19 May 1312, but not long after Thomas of Lancaster, acting with the Earls of Warwick, Hereford and Arundel, seized Gaveston and executed him on 19 June. This <b>criminal</b> <b>act</b> had the effect of garnering support for the King, and marginalising the rebellious earls. As far as Pembroke is concerned, the seizing and execution of a prisoner in his custody was a breach of the most fundamental chivalric codes, and a serious affront to his honour. The event must therefore be seen as pivotal in turning his sympathies away from the rebels and towards the King.|$|E

When Stan loses {{the use of his}} legs due to his prostate cancer, Tina asks Babe to visit so she can persuade him to seek medical help. Stan is pleased to see Babe and reconciles with Tina. Although Babe is upset when Stan proposes to Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), she encourages Cora to accept the proposal as Stan will never love her. After Stan's death, Babe excludes Cora from his funeral and encourages the rift between Mick and Shirley. After the funeral, Babe tells Sylvie, who is residing in a care home, that Stan has died, which frustrates Sylvie as she could not attend the funeral. Babe and Sylvie argue and exchange insults, leading to Babe slapping Sylvie. Sylvie then bites Babe's shoulder and threatens to report a <b>criminal</b> <b>act</b> that Babe and Queenie Trott (Judy Cornwell) committed several years earlier. Babe continues to create a rift between the Carter family and pays a teenager to throw a brick through the window of Shirley's son Dean Wicks's (Matt Di Angelo) salon. However, Dean's father, Buster Briggs (Karl Howman), learns the truth behind the attack and confronts Babe in front of the Carters, tipping a trifle over her head. After realising Babe's deceit, Mick and Shirley force Babe to leave Walford, but Babe warns that she will return.|$|E

In October 1982, seven people died after ingesting cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. The New York Times wrote a front-page story about the Tylenol scare every day in October, and produced 33 more stories about the issue after that. More than 100 law enforcement agents, and 1,100 Food and Drug Administration employees worked on the case.

The New York Times wrote three stories in 1981 and three more stories in 1982 about AIDS, none on the front page. The Tylenol Crisis was a <b>criminal</b> <b>act</b> of product-tampering; Legionnaire's Disease was a public health emergency.
