40|$|Some {{ten years}} ago, Michael Dooley (Dooley, 1997; Dooley, 2000) put forward an {{insurance}} model of currency crises, which after some modifications gives a good theoretical basis for {{explanation of the}} overall dynamics of the post communist transformation and diversity across countries and periods. The article analyses, {{within the framework of}} the insurance model, the role of monetary regimes (<b>currency</b> <b>anchor)</b> and EU enlargement (political and geostrategic anchor) and their relationships. The insurance game model not only contains an explanatory power, but it also has the potential to suggest a range of measures that could be useful in overcoming the "bad" dynamics, which we are witnessing today not only in the new member-states, but also EU-wide. post communist transformation, monetary regimes, insurance model of currency crisis...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{successful}} {{introduction of the}} euro in Western Europe, several regional economic blocs in Africa are planning to launch a common currency as an intermediary step towards the emergence of a single currency for the entire continent. The purpose of this dissertation is to tackle several economic issues related to monetary integration and empirically apply it to the context of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). In the first essay, we estimate trade potentials for southern African countries using the gravity model approach. More specifically, we use the level of infra-regional trade as predicted by the gravity model and compared it with the observed trade in order to assess the trade potentials in the region, as well as the South Africa's trade potentials with its SADC partners. Our results demonstrate that the observed trade flows among SADC countries are largely greater than the ones predicted by the empirical model. We also found that other SADC member countries over-trade with respect to South Africa. However, there are still some unexploited trade potentials for several pairs of SADC countries. The second essay deals with the issue of the choice for the optimal nominal <b>currency</b> <b>anchor</b> to which the national currencies of the region have to be pegged to. Using a panel of 63 countries, we obtained OCA indices à la Bayoumi and Eichengreen for SADC countries vis-à-vis five potential nominal anchor currencies, and we find that the optimal nominal <b>currency</b> <b>anchor</b> for these countries is the US dollar. We also find several pairs of SADC countries which are suitable for a common currency {{on the basis of the}} estimated OCA indices. In the last essay, we empirically assess the expandability of the CMA within the SADC by investigating the convergence of monetary policies of each SADC member to that of South Africa, a proxy for CMA. Empirical tests show evidence of long-run relationship between South Africa and two countries, namely Botswana and Mauritius suggesting that these countries may able to follow the leadership of the South African Reserve Bank. Following the results of the Granger-causality test, the leadership hypothesis in the strict sense is rejected for the case of Mauritius and Botswana. However, the only other country which shows evidence of following the South Africa's leadership in terms of Granger-causality is Malawi. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT...|$|E
40|$|The {{terms of}} trade of commodity-exporting {{countries}} are directly affected by the large-scale swings of worldwide prices. These {{terms of trade}} represent {{one of the key}} determinants of the real exchange rates of these economies. By estimating long-term equilibrium exchange rates we can gauge their impact for oil exporters and for exporters of other commodities. We then evaluate currency ‘misalignments’ as the discrepancies between the observed real exchange rates and their equilibrium values. Can these misalignments themselves be explained? In countries whose <b>currencies</b> are <b>anchored</b> to the dollar or to the euro, the misalignments are shown to depend on the behaviour of the <b>anchor</b> <b>currency.</b> When the <b>anchor</b> <b>currency</b> appreciates, the <b>anchored</b> <b>currencies</b> tend to be overvalued; when it depreciates, their undervaluation is likely.

40|$|On February 2, 2002, Lithuania {{switched}} its <b>currency</b> <b>anchor</b> {{from the}} dollar to the euro. While pegging {{to the dollar}} (since April 1994) has proven successful throughout the transition years, the recent decision to peg to the euro was motivated by the increasing trade relations with European economies. Pizzati does not argue which peg is more appropriate, but he analyzes the implications of changing the exchange rate regime for different sectors and labor groups. While pegging to the euro entails more stability for the export sector, Lithuania is still dependent on dollar-based imports of primary goods from the Commonwealth of Independent States, more so than other Baltic countries or Central European economies. The author uses a multisector general equilibrium model to compare the effects of dollar-euro exchange rate movements under these alternative pegs. Overall, simulation results suggest that while a euro-peg will provide more stability to GDP and employment, it will also imply more volatility in prices, suggesting that under the new peg macroeconomic policy should be more concerned with inflationary pressures than before. From a sector-specific perspective, pegging to the euro will provide a more stable demand for unskilled-intensive manufacturing and commercial services. But other sectors, such as agriculture, will still face the same vulnerability to exchange rate movements. This suggests that additional policy measures {{may be needed to}} compensate sector-specific divergences.

50|$|A reserve <b>{{currency}}</b> (or <b>anchor</b> <b>currency)</b> is {{a currency}} that {{is held in}} significant quantities by governments and institutions {{as part of their}} foreign exchange reserves. The reserve currency is commonly used in international transactions, international investments and all aspects of the global economy. It is often considered a hard currency or safe-haven currency.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} renminbi (RMB) has supplanted the US dollar {{as the major}} <b>anchor</b> <b>currency</b> in the currency baskets of East Asian economies. First, we systematically demonstrate that existing techniques {{to address the problem}} of severe multicollinearity in estimations of the Frankel-Wei regression model, with the movements in both the RMB and the US dollar included on the right-hand side of the equation, remain limited in providing stable and robust results. Then we propose a simple modification of the Frankel-Wei regression model to estimate the RMB weight in an economy's currency basket. Using this new approach, we find that there is not yet an RMB bloc in East Asia, contrary to claims made by some recent studies. We find that the US dollar continues to be the dominant <b>anchor</b> <b>currency</b> in the region. The RMB has taken on some importance in the currency baskets of many East Asian economies in recent years and this appears to have occurred at the expense of the yen. In short, despite the rising importance of the RMB, it has not eclipsed the US dollar as the dominant <b>anchor</b> <b>currency</b> in East Asia...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} capital market integration and currency crises {{of the last}} decade have renewed the debate on optimal exchange rate regimes. Research is mixed regarding what their effect has been on the system of exchange rate regimes and the <b>anchor</b> <b>currencies</b> at the centre of the system. The debate is complicated by growing empirical evidence that the de jure regimes announced by governments often differ from the de facto regimes that are actually applied. In this paper we divide the period 1990 - 2002 according to the major crises and use the generalized method of moments to identify the individual de facto regimes and relevant <b>anchor</b> <b>currencies</b> for each sub-period. We find that although intermediate regimes {{as a percentage of the}} overall database remained stable over the three periods, the type of peg and <b>anchor</b> <b>currencies</b> varied considerably. Pegs on a single currency fell from 62 % of the sample in the first period to 49 % in the second period, then rose to 66 % in the third period. Basket pegs rose from 33 % in the first period to 51 % in the second period and back to 34 % in the third period. Independent floats disappeared after the first period. When we group countries according to their access to capital markets, we find that all nine of the developed countries in the sample followed some type of intermediate regime for all three periods. We also find a trend towards hard pegs in the group of countries that has managed to increase its integration in the {{international capital}} markets.
