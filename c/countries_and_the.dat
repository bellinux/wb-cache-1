5|$|Migration from Cyprus to the UK has {{occurred}} {{in part due to}} the colonial links between the <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> internal conflict that followed Cyprus' independence from the British Empire in 1960. Migration peaked at the time of independence but has continued on a smaller scale. The number of Cypriot-born people in the UK fell between the 1991 and 2001 censuses, but the community, including people of Cypriot ancestry, remains sizeable, and the Cypriot-born population grew slightly between the 2001 and 2011 censuses.|$|E
5|$|Netball is {{most popular}} in Commonwealth <b>countries,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> most popular women's spectator sport in Australia and Tanzania {{and the effort}} to {{increase}} media attention and participation for women's sport often goes to Olympic sports with low participation rates, low rates of interest and few facilities.

Instead, according to Jones, the media focus on female athletes in non-team competitions and on team sports played equally by both genders.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1798, the War of the First Coalition {{had come to an}} end with French control of Northern Italy, much of the Low <b>Countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Rhineland confirmed by the Treaty of Campo Formio. Of all the major European powers that had at one time allied against the French Republic, only the Kingdom of Great Britain remained hostile, and the French Directory determined to end the French Revolutionary Wars by eliminating Britain. A series of invasions of the British Isles were planned, and the 28-year-old General Napoleon Bonaparte, who had defeated the Austrians in Italy the previous year, was assigned to lead the Armée d'Angleterre (Army of England) that had been assembled at Boulogne. However, the English Channel was firmly controlled by the Royal Navy and French invasion supplies, particularly of viable landing craft, were totally inadequate for the purpose.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, the {{emergency}} medicine systems (EMSs) in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore were largely mature, leading some practitioners {{to focus on}} developing the specialty in other countries. Thus, international emergency medicine as a subspecialty began in the 1990s, although some isolated efforts to achieve some of its goals {{had taken place in}} the late 1980s. There were several reasons for the heightened interest these practitioners had in developing emergency medicine abroad. One was the contrast between the EMSs of their <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> EMSs of other countries. Another was the revolutions of 1989, overthrowing authoritarian regimes, which facilitated spread of new ideas, such as emergency medicine.|$|E

5|$|Former World Bank Chief Economist {{and former}} Chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Joseph E. Stiglitz {{referred}} {{in the late}} 1990s to a growing consensus {{that something is wrong}} with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great {{number of people who are}} hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of moral hazard, particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted <b>countries,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and technological advancements into economies.|$|E
5|$|Greene {{was born}} in Apponaug, Rhode Island, one of nine {{children}} of Caleb and Sarah Robinson (Greene) Greene. His family had roots in the founding of Rhode Island and in the American Revolutionary War, including General Nathanael Greene, George's second cousin. Caleb was a financially shrewd ship owner and merchant, but the Embargo Act of 1807, which prohibited U.S. vessels from carrying goods to other <b>countries,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> War of 1812 left his family in financial difficulties. Young George attended Wrentham Academy and then a Latin grammar school in Providence and hoped to attend Brown University there, but his impoverished father could not afford it, so he moved to New York City and found work in a dry goods store on Pearl Street.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, exports totalled 90,000 barrels, but by 1964 {{had grown}} to 300,000 barrels. By 1959, sales in Ghana had grown large enough for Guinness to {{establish}} a joint venture {{in the country with}} the United Africa Company. By 1962, Nigeria had become the largest export market for Guinness, with around 100,000 barrels exported to the country every year. This led the company to build a brewery in Ikeja in western Nigeria to supply the demand; it was only the third brewery in the company's history. The brewery cost over £2 million, had a 150,000 barrel capacity, and was 60 per cent owned by Guinness Nigeria, 25 per cent by the United Africa Company with the remaining shares held by local Nigerian interests. Breweries followed in Malaysia (1965), Cameroon (1970) and Ghana (1971), whilst licences were granted to other companies to brew Guinness under contract in other African <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> West Indies. Historically a small proportion of Guinness production, it was this success, especially in Africa but also in Asia, that allowed FES to grow into a 4.5 million hectolitre brand.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{occupation}} {{came under}} two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low <b>Countries,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> annexed portions of Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8 billion US Dollars) {{by the end}} of the war, this figure does not include the sizeable plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods. Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total German income as the war went on.|$|E
5|$|Islam has {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of aniconism, and it is considered highly blasphemous in most Islamic traditions to visually depict Muhammad. This, compounded with {{a sense that the}} cartoons insulted Muhammad and Islam, offended many Muslims. Danish Muslim organisations that objected to the depictions responded by petitioning the embassies of Islamic <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Danish government to take action in response, and filed a judicial complaint against the newspaper, which was dismissed in January 2006. After the Danish government refused to meet with diplomatic representatives of the Muslim countries and would not intervene in the case, a number of Danish imams visited the Middle East in late 2005 to raise awareness of the issue. They presented a dossier containing the twelve cartoons from the Jyllands-Posten, and other information some of which was found to be falsified.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 6.6 million people, mostly in Mexico, Central America and South America, have Chagas disease as of 2015. In 2015, Chagas was estimated to result in 8,000 deaths.

Large-scale population movements have increased the areas where Chagas disease is found and these include many European <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States. These areas have also seen {{an increase in the}} years up to 2014. The disease was first described in 1909 by the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, after whom it is named. Chagas disease is classified as a neglected tropical disease. It affects more than 150 other animals.|$|E

5|$|Money {{comes from}} Lebanese {{business}} groups, private persons, businessmen, the Lebanese diaspora involved in African diamond exploration, other Islamic groups and <b>countries,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> taxes {{paid by the}} Shia Lebanese. Hezbollah says that {{the main source of}} its income comes from its own investment portfolios and donations by Muslims, however, Western sources maintain that Hezbollah actually receives most of its financial, training, weapons, explosives, political, diplomatic, and organizational aid from Iran and Syria. Iran is said to have given $400 million between 1983 and 1989 through donation. The situation has been changed due to economic problems, but Iran still funds humanitarian actions carried on by Hezbollah. According to reports released in February 2010, Hezbollah received $400million from Iran. The US estimates that Iran has been giving Hezbollah about US$60–100million per year in financial assistance. Other estimates are as high as $200-million annually. In 2011 Iran earmarked $7 million to Hezbollah’s activities in the region.|$|E

5|$|No.6 Squadron's first F-111Cs {{arrived at}} Amberley on 1 June 1973, and the unit flew its first sorties with the {{aircraft}} on the 13th of the month.

From August 1979, No.6 Squadron gained a photo reconnaissance role when it was issued with four aircraft which had been modified into RF-111Cs.

Training was conducted in Australia and nearby <b>countries,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> RF-111Cs occasionally deployed to the United States {{to take part in}} exercises held there. In June 1982 No.6 Squadron was expanded to include a Survey Flight, which undertook photo survey flights in co-operation with the Army's Royal Australian Survey Corps using a leased Learjet. The flight conducted surveys of south-eastern Australia, northern Australia, Fiji and parts of Indonesia and Malaysia until it was disbanded on 15 May 1987.|$|E
