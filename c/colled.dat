A rack railway, the Bavarian Zugspitze Railway, runs inside the northern flank of the mountain and ends on the Zugspitzplatt, from where a second cable car takes passengers to the top. The rack railway and the Eibsee Cable Car, the third cableway, transport an average of 500,000 people to the summit each year. In winter, nine ski lifts cover the ski area on the Zugspitzplatt. The weather station, opened in 1900, and the research station in the Schneefernerhaus are mainly used to conduct climate research.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1, <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) and myeloperoxydase (MPO) {{levels in}} serum {{of patients with}} knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA) before the surgery, 3 months and 1 year after knee or hip replacement. METHODS: <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1, <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) and MPO were measured in 103 patients with isolated symptomatic knee or hip OA candidates for joint replacement. Sera were taken the day before surgery, 3 months and 1 year after hip or knee replacement. <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) immunohistochemistry was performed on biopsies removed from cartilage lesions. RESULTS: Immunostainings revealed the extensive presence of <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) in the superficial layer of fibrillated cartilage and around some chondrocytes clusters. Three months after joint replacement, <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 and MPO serum levels were decreased and even reached the reference value for <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1. By contrast, <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) levels remained elevated. At 1 -year follow-up, <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 levels remained at the reference value, MPO levels {{were similar to those}} measured at 3 months, and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) levels were unchanged and comparable to the pre-surgery values. However, in patients with pre-surgery values above the median (more than 0. 42 nM), <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) levels significantly and progressively decreased post-operatively, but tended towards an increase in patients with pre-surgery <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO(2) values below the median. CONCLUSIONS: The normalisation of <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 levels 3 months after surgery indicates that <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 is a disease-specific marker that is sensitive to the structural changes occurring in a single joint. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical findings are consistent with the concept that the major source of serum <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 is the damaged articular cartilage.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} {{results of a}} study of TiN films which are {{deposited}} by Physical Vapor Deposition and Ion Beam Assisted Deposition. In the present investigation the subsequent ion implantation was provided with N 2 + ions. The ion implantation was applied to enhance the mechanical properties of the surface. The film deposition process exerts a number of effects such as crystallographic orientation, morphology, topography, densification of the films. The evolution of the microstructure from porous and columnar grains to densely packed grains is accompanied by changes in mechanical and physical properties. A variety of analytic techniques were used for characterization, such as scratch test, calo test, SEM, AFM, XRD and EDAX. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} mechanical hardness is elevated by penetration of nitrogen, whereas the Young’s modulus is significantly elevated. Thin hard coatings deposited by physical vapour deposition (PVD), e. g. titanium nitride (TiN) are frequently used to improve tribological performance in many engineering applications. Ion bombardment during vapour deposition of thin films, <b>colled</b> ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD), exerts a number of effects such as densification, changes in grain size, crystallographic orientation, morphology and topography of the films.

Therefore, in recent years, a number of measurements have been made in which nanoindentation and AFM have been combined...|$|E

The rejection of a direct mind-matter link distinguishes functionalism from the mind-body identity theory, according to which types of mental states such as thoughts are identical to types of states in the brain.

40|$|São apresentados 14 casos de aneurismas e/ou dissecções da aorta torácica submetidos a correção cirúrgica com o emprego de hipotermia profunda e parada circulatória. Entre os 14 pacientes, seis eram portadores de aneurismas da aorta (um de aorta ascendente, três do arco aórtico, um de aorta ascendente + arco aórtico, um de aorta descendente) e oito eram portadores de dissecção aórtica. A hipotermia foi induzida gradualmente até atingir 18 ºC de temperatura nasofaríngea. O período médio de parada circulatória foi de 35 minutos. Houve quatro óbitos hospitalares, sendo um por problemas hemorrágicos, um por arritmia {{ventricular}} pós IAM, um por insuficiência renal aguda já existente no pré-operatório e um por AVC e infecção pulmonar secundária. Dos 10 pacientes, dois apresentaram insuficiência respiratória com assistência ventilatória prolongada e quatro apresentaram distúrbios neurológicos transitórios, com recuperação total. A técnica de hipotermia profunda e parada circulatória mostrou-se como boa alternativa na abordagem cirúrgica de lesões graves da aorta torácica. The authors report 14 {{cases of}} aneurysms and/or dissections of the thoracic aorta, treated with deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest. There were 6 aneurysms of the aorta (1 of the ascending aorta, 3 of the aortic arch, 1 of the ascending aorta and aortic arch, 1 of the descending aorta) and 8 cases of aortic dissections. The patients were gradually <b>colled</b> down to 18 ºC of nasopharingeal temperature. The mean circulatory arrest time was 35 minutes. There were 4 hospital deaths; 1 patient {{died in the}} operating room, from persistent surgical bleeding; 1 patient died from acute renal failure, which was already present in the pre-operative period; 1 patient died after an acute myocardial infarction followed by ventricular fibrillation; 1 patient died from pulmonary infection following a carebro-vascular accident. This was the only death {{directly related to the}} circulatory arrest technique. Among the 10 survivors, there were 2 patients who required prolonged ventilatory support and 4 minor neurological abnormalities with complete recovery. The technique of deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest proved to be a good alternative in the treatment of difficult aortic lesions...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Protein {{nitration}} is {{a prominent}} feature of inflammatory {{processes in the}} joint. We have developed immunoassays specific for a peptide of the alpha-helical region of type II collagen (108) HRGYPGLDG(116) (<b>Coll</b> 2 - 1) and its nitrated form (108) HRGY(NO 2) PGLDG(116) (<b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2) in biological fluids. Design: <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2 peptides were injected into rabbits. Two antisera (D 3 and D 37) were selected for their specificity and affinity and used to develop specific immunoassays. <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2 were measured in sera of 242 healthy subjects (N), 67 patients with primary knee osteoarthritis (OA) and 19 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Results: In healthy subjects, <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2 concentrations were 125. 13 +/- 3. 71 nM and 0. 16 +/- 0. 08 nM, respectively. In OA and RA, <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2 serum levels {{were found to be}} significantly increased compared to controls of the same range of age (<b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 : OA: 200. 80 +/- 8. 98 nM, RA: 172. 30 +/- 19. 05 nM, normal: 126. 60 +/- 6. 70 nM and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2 : OA: 0. 26 +/- 0. 02, RA: 0. 38 +/- 0. 05, normal: 0. 12 +/- 0. 01 nM). <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2 levels were significantly more elevated in RA than in OA patients (P < 0. 05). As a consequence, the ratio <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2 /Coll 2 - 1 was 1. 6 times higher in RA than in OA subjects. No relationship was found between the radiological OA severity and the levels of <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2 in serum. <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2, but not <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1, was correlated with C-reactive protein in the sera of OA and RA patients. Conclusions: The determination of both <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 and <b>Coll</b> 2 - 1 NO 2 in serum of arthritic patients seems to be a promising useful tool for the detection of oxidative-related cartilage degradation episode. Further, these markers could be helpful for monitoring the effects of anti-inflammatory or antioxidant drugs on cartilage degradation. (c) 2004 OsteoArthritis Research Society International.
