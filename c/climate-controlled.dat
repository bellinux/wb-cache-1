5|$|By {{this time}} work {{had already begun}} on MAR-II on Kwajalein; built by General Electric, it {{differed}} in form and in its beam steering system. The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land {{just west of the}} original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into a pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only one set of transmitter and receiver elements, but with all the wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a <b>climate-controlled</b> storage facility.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists at the {{monument}} find, describe the location of, and collect fossil-bearing rocks {{from more than}} 700 sites. They {{take them to the}} paleontology laboratory at the visitor center, where the fossils are stabilized, separated from their rock matrix, and cleaned. The fossil specimens are then catalogued, indexed, stored in <b>climate-controlled</b> cabinets, and made available for research. In addition to preparing fossils, the paleontologists coordinate {{the monument}}'s basic research in paleobotany and other scientific areas and manage the fossil museum in the visitor center.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{focal point}} of the Cycle Center is an atrium that introduces the two lower levels of facilities and provides an aesthetic above-ground presence. The atrium, which has been praised by Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Blair Kamin more than once, has a sloping solar paneled roof. The 120solar panels produce 6.5percent of the electricity supply required for the <b>climate-controlled</b> building. The Cycle Center has an opaque design, with thin steel frames for its main windows. The interior design uses stainless steel and blond wood, and shade is produced by awnings.|$|E
5|$|Trogloraptor spin simple webs {{with only}} a few strands, hung from the roofs of caves. Griswold et al. stated that the claws may have a {{significant}} function in capturing prey. Similar to the Nelson cave spider of New Zealand (Spelungula cavernicola, a gradungulid), Trogloraptor probably dangle upside down from their webs, snatching at passing flying insects with their claws. However their exact prey remains unknown. Captured live specimens were raised in <b>climate-controlled</b> laboratory conditions in an effort to find out. These specimens were offered moths, crickets and other spiders as food; but these were declined and the specimens starved after two weeks. This may indicate a preference for very specific prey.|$|E
5|$|While caddisflies in {{the wild}} {{construct}} their cases out of twigs, sand, aquatic plants, and rocks, the French artist Hubert Duprat makes art by providing wild caddisflies with precious stones and other materials. He collected caddisfly larvae from the wild {{and put them in}} <b>climate-controlled</b> tanks. He removes the larvae from their original cases and adds precious and semi-precious items such as grains of gold into the tank. The larvae then build new cases out of precious items, creating a unique form of artwork. The resulting works are sold across the world.|$|E
5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, {{in the more}} {{developed}} parts of the world, animals are often intensively managed; dairy cows may be kept in zero-grazing conditions with all their forage brought to them; beef cattle may be kept in high density feedlots; pigs may be housed in <b>climate-controlled</b> buildings and never go outdoors; poultry may be reared in barns and kept in cages as laying birds under lighting-controlled conditions. In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family run farms where livestock graze outside {{for much of the}} year, silage or hay is made to cover the times of year when the grass stops growing, and fertiliser, feed and other inputs are bought onto the farm from outside.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{preparation}} method pioneered by the Royal Ontario Museum removes all bones {{for a complete}} skeleton while also producing a round skin without bill or legs (called a ROM, though if one set of wing and leg bones remain with the skin the preparation is called a shmoo in North America). Alternatively, the entire bird (or any soft parts associated with preparations described above) may be preserved in alcohol. For any of these methods, several supplemental preparations may be made. For example, a wing may be removed and preserved separately as a spread wing for better study of flight feathers; a tissue sample may be removed and frozen for molecular analyses; or a recording of the bird's song before collection may be archived. Neither molecular samples nor sound recordings require a bird to be collected (killed). Finally, if the bird is too rotten for the skin and feathers to be preserved, {{as is the case}} with some salvaged specimens, the skeleton alone may be preserved. Dried tissue is removed from skeletons by using dermestid beetle larvae (genus Dermestes). Whereas in the past arsenic was routinely added to skins to protect them from destruction by insects, specimens prepared today are generally protected by an initial freezing period to kill insects and their eggs followed by keeping them in high-quality museum cases in a <b>climate-controlled</b> room. Each specimen has data associated with it, and the amount of data available is usually directly correlated with the specimen’s scientific value. Most specimens are of little value for research without accompanying information, such as the time and place the bird was found or collected. This and other important information, such as mass, sex, fat deposition, and degree of skull ossification, is written on a label along with a unique field and museum number. Modern computerized museum databases include all of this information for each specimen, as well as the types of methods used to prepare the bird. Modern collections seek to maximize the utility of each preserved individual, and this includes recording detailed information about it. Most modern specimens also include a tissue sample preserved for genetic study. Online access to collections’ data is becoming increasingly available, and a cross-institutional database covering millions of computerized bird records is in development.|$|E

25|$|By 2004, the U-boat's {{exterior}} {{had suffered}} noticeable {{damage from the}} weather so in April 2004 the museum moved the U-boat to a new underground, covered, <b>climate-controlled</b> location. Now protected from the elements, the restored U-505 reopened to the public on 5 June 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{picture is}} kept under strict, <b>climate-controlled</b> {{conditions}} in its bulletproof glass case. The humidity is maintained at 50%±10%, {{and the temperature}} is maintained between 18 and 21°C. To compensate for fluctuations in relative humidity, the case is supplemented with a bed of silica gel treated to provide 55% relative humidity.|$|E
25|$|The stadium {{does not}} have a {{retractable}} roof, though one was considered initially. Such a roof was cited to add $100 million to the total budget and none of the parties (Twins, Hennepin County or Minnesota Legislature) were willing to pay for that cost. Much like other northern cities with outdoor professional baseball (i.e. Chicago, Detroit, Boston, Cleveland, New York), the weather in Minneapolis during a 162-game baseball season and playoffs can vary from early-spring snow to rain and hot, humid weather. The Metrodome was <b>climate-controlled,</b> and thus, protected the baseball schedule during the entire time that it had been the venue for the Minnesota Twins. However, many Twins fans and baseball purists argue that this same sterile, <b>climate-controlled</b> environment creates a less-than-desirable atmosphere for watching baseball. The architect also tested the feasibility of heated seats.|$|E
25|$|Other notable {{features}} of Philip Johnson’s 2001 expansion include a 160-seat auditorium, complete with advanced distance-learning technology; <b>climate-controlled</b> vaults for both cool and cold photography storage; dedicated laboratory {{space for the}} conservation of photographs and works on paper; a state-of-the-art research library and archives storage facility; and a greatly expanded museum bookstore.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} also {{operates a}} satellite campus {{in the far}} northwest corner of Calgary on 85 Street N.W.

25|$|The {{building}} was severely damaged by a fire on April 30, 2007 and underwent a $17.9 million renovation and expansion. The {{building was}} re-opened on October 18, 2010 with a LEED-Silver Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. A newly constructed, <b>climate-controlled</b> third floor now houses {{the collections of}} the original Peabody Library and is a center for research on Georgetown history.|$|E
25|$|Dairy {{products}} are constantly {{in need of}} refrigeration, {{and it was only}} discovered {{in the past few decades}} that eggs needed to be refrigerated during shipment rather than waiting to be refrigerated after arrival at the grocery store. Meats, poultry and fish all must be kept in <b>climate-controlled</b> environments before being sold. Refrigeration also helps keep fruits and vegetables edible longer.|$|E
25|$|As <b>climate-controlled,</b> {{suburban}} {{shopping centers}} became {{common in the}} 1960s, communities began to explore ways of drawing retail and entertainment business back into downtown areas. An experimental method of encouraging business was a downtown mall. One researcher found that approximately 200 pedestrian malls were constructed in the United States by {{the close of the}} 20th century, although only 15 remained in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Located in Nairobi Village, this <b>climate-controlled</b> indoor exhibit {{opened in}} 1993 and {{displays}} tropical African birds and insects. The {{entrance to the}} building is a simulated earthen crevasse with displays for stick insects and arachnids. The underground segment opens up to a room representing the rainforest understory, {{which leads to a}} second room representing the canopy. On display are long-tailed paradise whydah, purple grenadier, and other birds.|$|E
25|$|Koala Walkabout {{opened on}} March 10, 2012, in the Australian Outback area. It {{features}} koalas, red kangaroos, wallabies, kookaburras, a blue-tongued skink, and lorikeets. The koalas, Kobi and Tekin, are two males {{on loan from}} the San Diego Zoo. Kobi and Tekin {{spend most of their}} time dozing in a eucalyptus tree within their <b>climate-controlled</b> exhibit. The zoo is currently one of only ten in the nation to exhibit koalas.|$|E
25|$|King Tutankhamun's mummy still {{rests in}} his tomb in the Valley of the Kings. On 4 November 2007, 85 {{years to the}} day after Carter's discovery, the 19-year-old pharaoh went on display in his {{underground}} tomb at Luxor, when the linen-wrapped mummy was removed from its golden sarcophagus to a <b>climate-controlled</b> glass box. The case was designed to prevent the heightened rate of decomposition caused by the humidity and warmth from tourists visiting the tomb.|$|E
25|$|In {{anticipation}} of a decision to exhibit the document in 1990 (the sesquicentennial of the signing), full documentation and reproduction photography was carried out. Several years of planning culminated {{with the opening of}} the <b>climate-controlled</b> Constitution Room at the then National Archives by Mike Moore, Prime Minister of New Zealand, in November 1990. It was announced in 2012 that the nine Treaty of Waitangi sheets would be relocated to the National Library of New Zealand in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Stockpiles of United States Marine Corps weapons, vehicles, {{ammunition}} {{and other equipment}} have been located in Norway since 1981 as {{part of what is}} currently designated the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program-Norway (MCPP-N). This material is stored in a network of <b>climate-controlled</b> caves and buildings near the city of Trondheim, and is drawn upon as part of worldwide US military operations. Norway has met most of the costs of the MCPP-N since the 1990s, and the sites are mainly staffed by Norwegians.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2007, the USBC {{completed}} a two-year study on bowling ball motion and how advanced, high-tech equipment may influence lane conditions and scoring. Establishing a Bowling Ball Specifications Task Force—comprising research engineers and volunteers from ball manufacturing companies—the USBC sought {{to better understand the}} motion of bowling balls using scientific research and data analysis. Test equipment included, but was not limited to, a robotic ball-thrower, a Computer Aided Tracking System ("Super C.A.T.S."), 59 reactive resin and particle bowling balls from various manufacturers, and eight lanes in a <b>climate-controlled</b> facility.|$|E
25|$|From {{the time}} the stadium was built to when it was demolished, the {{economics}} of sports marketing changed. Teams began charging higher prices for tickets, and demanding more amenities, such as bigger clubhouses and locker rooms, more luxury suites, and more concession revenue. To that end, pressure was applied by team owners, media, and fans to have the State of Minnesota provide newer, better facilities to host the teams. The Metrodome served its primary purpose, to provide a <b>climate-controlled</b> facility in which to host the three sports tenants in Minnesota with the largest attendance.|$|E
25|$|In July 2017, as {{temperatures}} in the city rose, straphangers expressed complaints about the high temperatures of stations along the line, {{even though they were}} supposed to be <b>climate-controlled.</b> This was since the MTA had to get permission from the City Health Department to cool the air, with a test ensuring no Legionnaires' disease in the cooling towers, a precaution arising from several deadly outbreaks in the city in previous years. The MTA had not conducted the test quickly enough, but after criticism, it received permission on July 7. Climate control was expected to be turned on by July 14.|$|E
25|$|On 6 April 2005—following {{a period}} of curatorial maintenance, recording, and analysis—the {{painting}} was {{moved to a new}} location within the museum's Salle des États. It is displayed in a purpose-built, <b>climate-controlled</b> enclosure behind bulletproof glass. Since 2005 the painting has been illuminated by an LED lamp, and in 2013 a new 20 watt LED lamp was installed, specially designed for this painting. The lamp has a colour rendering index up to 98, and minimizes infrared and ultraviolet radiation which could otherwise degrade the painting. The renovation of the gallery where the painting now resides was financed by the Japanese broadcaster Nippon Television. About 6million people view the painting at the Louvre each year.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the Minnesota Vikings were unhappy with Metropolitan Stadium's {{relatively}} small capacity for football (just under 48,500). Before the AFL-NFL merger, the NFL had declared that stadiums with a capacity smaller than 50,000 were not adequate for their needs. The biggest stadium {{in the area}} was the University of Minnesota's Memorial Stadium, but the Vikings were not willing to be tenants in a college football stadium and demanded a new venue. Supporters of a dome also believed that the Minnesota Twins would benefit from a <b>climate-controlled</b> stadium to insulate the team from harsh Minnesota weather later in the season. The Met would have likely needed to be replaced in any event, as it was not well maintained. Broken railings and seats {{could be seen in}} the upper deck by the early 1970s, and by its final season they had become a distinct safety hazard.|$|E
500|$|Southdale Center is a {{shopping}} mall located in Edina, Minnesota, a suburb of the Twin Cities. It opened in 1956 {{and is one of}} the oldest fully enclosed shopping malls, and the first <b>climate-controlled</b> one, in the United States. Southdale Center comprises [...] of leasable retail space, and contains approximately 123 retail tenants. The mall is partially owned by Simon Property Group and is anchored by Herberger's and Macy's.|$|E
