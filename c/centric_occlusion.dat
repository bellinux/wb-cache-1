40|$|The {{search for}} the ideal {{artificial}} tooth arrangement that maximizes denture stability, comfort, aesthetics, and function has occupied the dental literature {{for many years and}} still continues to do so. Of the many occlusal schemes that have been presented to the dental profession, that of lingualized occlusion has {{emerged as one of the}} more popular. The popularity of lingualized occlusion stems from the simplicity and flexibility of the concept and from its wide application to clinical practice (Parr & Ivanhoe, 1996). The registration of a repeatable correct centric jaw relation is not always possible. We don't know whether the patient will use centric relation during normal function. It is therefore useful to provide the patient with some freedom of movement around <b>centric.</b> lingualized <b>occlusion</b> provides freedom in centric. For many dentists the arrangement of artificial denture teeth into balanced occlusion is difficult and time consuming. As a result this task is most often performed by the dental technician. In the South African countryside dental laboratories are often far away. If dentists perform the arrangement of the denture teeth, time and costs can be saved. The mounting of denture teeth in lingualized occlusion is simple and fast. This will motivate dentists to arrange denture teeth themselves, with obvious benefits for both the patient and the dentist. The School of Oral Health Sciences of the University of Stellenbosch teaches this concept to its undergraduate students in order to improve the prosthetic service to the large edentulous population of South Africa.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the reliability of several selected signs of trauma from occlusion and their relations with severity of periodontitis. 32 moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis patients participated in the study. All teeth present were evaluated for various abnormal occlusal contacts, signs of trauma from occlusion, and the severity of periodontitis. Standardized periapical radiographs were also taken for each tooth. The results demonstrated that: (1) no significant difference occurred in probing pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (AL), or percentage of alveolar bone height (BH) between teeth with and without various abnormal occlusal contacts, i. e., premature contacts in <b>centric</b> relation <b>occlusion,</b> non-working contacts in lateral excursions, premature contacts of anterior teeth or posterior protrusive tooth contacts; (2) teeth with either significant mobility, functional mobility, or radiographically widened periodontal ligament space (PDLS) had deeper PD, more AL and lower BH than teeth without these signs, while teeth with pronounced wear or radiographically thickened lamina dura had less AL than teeth without these findings; (3) 2 combined indices, i. e., the trauma from occlusion index (TOI) and the adaptability index (AI), were proposed for the identification of occlusal trauma and the response of periodontium to excessive biting forces in heavy function, respectively; TOI-positive teeth exhibit deeper PD, more AL and less osseous support than TOI-negative teeth; however, AI-positive teeth had less AL and more osseous support than AI-negative teeth; (4) with identical attachment level, TOI-positive teeth had less osseous support than TOI-negative teeth while the magnitude of difference became greater with an increase of attachment loss. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether there is any relationship between the condition of complete dentures and TMDs. Methods: The sample consisted of 61 consecutive patients (35 females and 26 males) who were admitted to the Department of Prosthodontics of Mashhad Faculty of Dentistry for fabrication of new complete dentures.  The age range of the participants was between 32 and 80 years, with the mean age of 57. 05 ± 10. 26 years. The patients were examined by two prosthodontists. Using a questionnaire, the first prosthodontist asked the patients about their habits and history of trauma to the temporomandibular joints (TMJs). She then examined the participants for signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs).   The second prosthodontist examined each participant's existing denture and checked its fit, stability, retention, <b>occlusion,</b> and <b>centric</b> relation, and recorded how long it had been in service. The examination was double blind. The data were recorded in examination sheets. Results: The relationship between TMDs and denture fit, stability, retention, <b>centric</b> relation and <b>occlusion</b> was analyzed using Fisher’s Exact Test. No significant relationship was found between denture characteristics and TMDs in complete denture wearers (P-value> 0. 05).

5000|$|One of {{the keys}} in {{diagnosing}} the anterior crossbite due to skeletal vs dental causes is diagnosing a CR-CO shift in a patient. An adolescent presenting with anterior crossbite may be positioning their mandible forward into <b>centric</b> <b>occlusion</b> (CO) due to the dental interferences. Thus finding their occlusion in centric relation (CR) is key in diagnosis. For anterior crossbite, if their CO matches their CR then the patient truly has a skeletal component to their crossbite. If the CR shows a less severe class 3 malocclusion or teeth not in anterior crossbite, this may mean that their anterior crossbite results due to dental interferences.|$|E

Four different bone anchorage designs were simulated on a posterior maxillary segment using one implant with platform switching and internal Morse taper connection as follows: 2 mm subcrestal placement with (SW) or without (SO) the implant apex engaged into the cortical bone or position at bone level with anchorage only in the crestal cortical (BO) bone or with bicortical fixation (BW). Each implant received a premolar crown, and all models were loaded with 200 N to simulate <b>centric</b> and eccentric <b>occlusion.</b> The peak tensile and compressive stress and strain were calculated at the crestal cortical, trabecular, and apical cortical bone. The vertical and horizontal implant displacements were measured at the platform level. FEA indicated that subcrestal placement (SW and SO) created lower stress and strain in the crestal cortical bone compared with crestal placement (BO and BW models). The SW model exhibited lesser vertical and horizontal implant micromovement compared with the SO and BO models under eccentric loading; however, stress and strain {{were higher in the}} apical cortical bone. The BW model exhibited the lowest implant displacement. These results indicate that subcrestal placement decreases the stress in the crestal cortical bone of dental implants, regardless of apical anchorage however, apical cortical anchorage can be effective in limiting implant displacement. Further studies are required to evaluate the effects of possible remodeling around the apex on the success of subcrestal implants...|$|R
40|$|Bruxism is a {{pathological}} {{activity of the}} stomatognathic system that involves tooth grinding and clenching during parafunctional jaw movements. Clinical signs of bruxism are mostly related to dental wear and muscular and joint discomforts, but {{a large number of}} etiological factors can be listed, as local, systemic, psychological and hereditary factors. The association between bruxism, feeding and smoking habits and digestive disorders may lead to serious consequences to dental and related structures, involving dental alterations (wear, fractures and cracks), periodontal signs (gingival recession and tooth mobility) and muscle-joint sensivity, demanding a multidisciplinary treatment plan. This paper presents a case report in which bruxism associated with acid feeding, smoking habit and episodes of gastric reflow caused severe tooth wear and great muscular discomfort with daily headache episodes. From the diagnosis, a multidisciplinary treatment plan was established. The initial treatment approach consisted of medical follow up with counseling on diet and smoking habits and management of the gastric disorders. This was followed by the installation of an interocclusal acrylic device in <b>centric</b> relation of <b>occlusion</b> (CRO) for reestablishment of the occlusal stability, vertical dimension of occlusion, anterior guides and return to normal muscle activity (90 -day use approximately). After remission of initial symptoms, oral rehabilitation was implemented in CRO by means of full resin composite restorations and new interocclusal device for protection of restorations. Satisfactory esthetics, improved function and occlusal stability were obtained after oral rehabilitation. The patient has attended annual follow-ups for the past 2 years.

(DMA) 137 young people between 16 - 19 years of age were examined, including 57 with DMA and 80 without DMA. The diagnosis was established with the agreement of the International Headache Society (IHS) criteria and directories of the American Academy of Orofacial Pain. (AAOP). The occlusal conditions were evaluated with the help of the computer aided system T-Scan II (Tekscan, Inc, Boston, USA). According to this method occlusal point contacts (premature contacts) were evaluated at the beginning of the <b>occlusion</b> (<b>centric</b> relation-CR). At this time percentage distribution of the relative net force between teeth were determined. Teeth contacts with the maximum rel ative force along the dental arch were also recorded. In this way premature traumatic contacts were determined. There were also evaluated areas of support for the particular teeth or groups of the teeth in the maximum intercuspal position (MIP). The center of occlusal forces (COF) in MIP were then recorded. Finally percentage distribution of the values of the resultant occlusal force moments, acting on both sides of the dental arch, were evaluated. As normal differences in these values less than 9 % between bothsides of the dental arch were accepted. The other groups were defined on the basis of the differences in the values of both sides of the dental arch in the range: 10 - 19 % as a satisfactory group, 20 - 29 % as a moderate group, 30 - 39 % as a high degree group and finally more than 40 % as a very high degree group.

In the field of orthodontics, investigators, among other things, tried to evaluate correlation between EMG activity, occlusal relationships and craniofacial morphology to analyze the effect of muscular activity, as an etiological factor in malocclusion. The purpose of the present investigation is to analyze the effect of EMG activity of temporal and masseter muscles quantitatively in skeletal class III malocclusion. 26 patients (9 to If years old), with class III malocclusion were selected and their EMG activity of temporal and masseter muscles in rest position, <b>centric</b> <b>occlusion,</b> clenching, mastication and swallowing were compared with 20 normal children at the same age range. Then the statistical correlation between 13 cephalometric parameters and EMG activities were analyzed and then the regression analysis was performed and the results were as follows: 1 - The mean amplitude of masseter and temporal muscles activity in rest position, <b>centric</b> <b>occlusion,</b> mastication, and clenching in class III samples were greater than normal group (PO. 05). 2 - The mean duration of masseter and temporal muscles activity in rest position and <b>centric</b> <b>occlusion</b> in class III samples were more than normal group (PO. 05). 3 - According to regression analysis, a linear correlation was observed between ANB angle and temporal muscle activity in rest and <b>centric</b> <b>occlusion</b> that was not observed in other cases.

A study of the TMJ in healthy subjects showed that {{there were significant differences}} between men and women: the women tend to have more gentle articular tubercles and a flatter shape of the TMJ.

30|$|Distal {{relationship}} of the mandible to maxilla is usually described as Class II malocclusion, and it represents the most common disharmony in white race populations [1]. Either sagittal or vertical components were showed in Class II malocclusion patients; however, another relevant component is transverse dimension. Several authors [2, 3] evaluated transverse component of Class II malocclusion and found narrower maxillary arch in Class II division 1 malocclusion. Transverse maxillary deficiency, in fact, might not be evident in Class II patients due to occlusion of maxillary posterior teeth on narrower portions of the mandible [2, 3]. Indeed maxillary constriction might often be clinically observed by forcing lower jaw of Class II patients forward in dental Class I relationship. Tollaro et al.
