50|$|Fearing that Communists {{would take}} over the Central American nation of Nicaragua if it {{remained}} {{under the leadership of}} the left-wing Sandinistas, the Reagan administration authorized CIA Director William J. Casey to arm the right-wing <b>Contras</b> early in his tenure. Congress, which favored negotiations between the <b>Contras</b> and Sandinista, passed the 1982 Boland Amendment, prohibiting the CIA and Defense Department from using their budgets to aid to the <b>Contras.</b> Still intent on supporting the <b>Contras,</b> the Reagan administration raised funds for the <b>Contras</b> from private donors and foreign governments.|$|R
25|$|During {{their war}} against the Nicaraguan government, the <b>Contras</b> {{committed}} {{a large number of}} human rights violations and used terrorist tactics, carrying out more than 1300 terrorist attacks. These actions were frequently carried out systematically {{as a part of the}} strategy of the <b>Contras.</b> Supporters of the <b>Contras</b> tried to downplay these violations, particularly the Reagan administration in the US, which engaged in a campaign of white propaganda to alter public opinion in favor of the <b>contras.</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{front of}} the International Court of Justice, Nicaragua claimed that the <b>contras</b> were {{altogether}} a creation of the U.S. This claim was rejected. However, the evidence of a very close relationship between the <b>contras</b> and the United States was considered overwhelming and incontrovertible. The U.S. played a very large role in financing, training, arming, and advising the <b>contras</b> over a long period, and the <b>contras</b> only became capable of carrying out significant military operations {{as a result of}} this support.|$|R
50|$|In 1984 the Nicaraguan {{government}} filed a suit in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) {{against the}} United States. Nicaragua {{stated that the}} <b>contras</b> were completely created and managed by the U.S. Although this claim was rejected, the court found overwhelming and undeniable evidence of a very close relationship between the <b>Contras</b> and the United States. The U.S. {{was found to have}} had a very large role in providing financial support, training, weapons, and other logistical support to the <b>Contras</b> over a lengthy period of time, and that this support was essential to the <b>Contras.</b>|$|R

25|$|Nevertheless, {{the case}} for support of the <b>contras</b> {{continued}} {{to be made in}} Washington, D.C., by both the Reagan administration and The Heritage Foundation, which argued that support for the <b>contras</b> would counter Soviet influence in Nicaragua.|$|R

50|$|Beyond restricting overt U.S. {{support of}} the <b>Contras,</b> the most {{significant}} effect of the Boland Amendment was the Iran-Contra affair, during which the Reagan Administration circumvented the Amendment, without consent of Congress, {{in order to continue}} supplying arms to the <b>Contras.</b>|$|R

5|$|Minutes later Alavés {{made the}} first {{substitution}} of the match when Iván Alonso replaced defender Dan Eggen. The change had the desired effect as four minutes later, Alavés scored. Right wing-back Cosmin <b>Contra</b> put {{the ball into the}} area form {{the right side of the}} pitch and Alonso rose above Babbel to head the ball into the net to make the scoreline 2–1. Immediately afterwards, Alavés were almost level when <b>Contra</b> put another ball into the penalty area, however, Henchoz cleared the ball before an Alavés player could reach it.

5|$|Proposals {{to simplify}} the fare {{structure}} abound. A flat fare that disregards distance has been proposed, or simpler fare bands or zones. Either scheme would shift the fare-box recovery burden to the urban riders in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley and away from suburban riders in East <b>Contra</b> Costa, Southern Alameda, and San Mateo Counties, where density is lowest, and consequently, operational cost is highest.|$|E
