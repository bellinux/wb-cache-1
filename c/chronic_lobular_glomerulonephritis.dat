40|$|ABSTRACT. Chronic {{hepatitis}} {{has been}} broadly defined as liver inflammation without improvement {{for at least}} 6 months. A more accurate definition is Hit is a chronic necroinflammatorydisease of variable severity that is not associated with features of chronic cholestasis or with steatasis or Malory body forma-tion. " Histological classification of chronic hepatitis included chronic persis-tent hepatitis. chronic active hepatitis, and <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> hepatitis. The histo-pathologicalaspects of chronic hepatitis are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{classification}} of chronic hepatitis introduced in 1968 is still current, {{but has been}} modified. The concept of bridging hepatic necrosis has been incorporated, and is recognised as an important feature of both acute and chronic aggressive (active) hepatitis (CAH). In the pathogenesis of the latter, piecemeal necrosis is, however, {{thought to be the}} more important factor. The histological picture of CAH varies widely. Several causes of CAH have been identified, including hepatitis B virus. Recognition of surface and core components of the virus in tissue sections has facilitated study of the relationship between host response and pathological lesion in chronic hepatitis. CAH and primary biliary cirrhosis share histological features, and a mixed form has been postulated. Staining for copper sometimes helps to distinguish the two lesions.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{outcome of}} non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis was evaluated in 21 patients {{who developed the}} illness after open-heart surgery and could be followed thereafter up to five years. Histological chronic sequelae were documented in 13 patients, and consisted of chronic persistent hepatitis in one case, <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> hepatitis in two and chronic active hepatitis in 10, five of whom also developed superimposed cirrhosis. Progression to these chronic states was in most cases symptomless, independently {{of the severity of}} liver lesions; one patient, however, died of gastrointestinal bleeding due to cirrhosis of the liver. During follow-up the biochemical pattern of chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis was unique, while striking fluctuations of transaminase levels. Liver histology proved essential to identify the severity of chronic liver lesions, as clinical and biochemical features were uniform and not indicative of it. Our results suggest that cirrhosis may develop, often with an asymptomatic course, in a significant number of patients who do not recover after acute post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of active}} {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) infection in chronic HBsAg positive hepatitis {{with and without}} hepatitis delta virus (HDV) superinfection was analysed in percutaneous liver biopsy specimens from 50 patients. Each specimen was divided into two [...] one part for histological evaluation and {{for the detection of}} HBcAg and delta antigen; the other part was tested for HBV-DNA using Southern blotting. Ten cases were of <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> hepatitis, 10 of chronic persistent hepatitis, and 30 of chronic active hepatitis. Ten cases were delta antigen positive and showed high grade lobular activity but no evidence of HBV-DNA episomal forms or HBcAg reactivity. Twenty one cases showed HBV-DNA replicative intermediate forms; 19 had high grade lobular activity, which occurred in five cases without evidence of free viral DNA. Of the 21 biopsy specimens with HBV-DNA episomal forms, 14 were positive for HBcAg; only one of the 19 cases without detectable viral DNA was positive for such antigen. These data indicate that the presence of HBV or HDV active infection correlates with the histological finding of prominent lobular necrosis. Moreover, intrahepatic HBV-DNA seems to be a more sensitive marker than the presence of viral antigens for indicating HBV replication...|$|R
40|$|As {{reported}} for other chronic liver diseases, hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronic infection {{might result in}} malnutrition. In order to establish whether this disease could be responsible of malnutrition and hence influence growth, 75 children, chronically infected with HBV, have been followed up for 4 years. Thirty-one of them had chronic active hepatitis (CAH), 25 chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH), 14 <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> hepatitis (CLH), and five cirrhosis (three active, two inactive). The nutritional status was evaluated every 12 months, with careful physical and laboratory examinations. General nutritional status was estimated according to Waterlow criteria (13, 14). At our first observation, 50 children were following a balanced diet with a caloric intake adequate for age and weight, whereas 25 were on a low-fat diet, begun in the belief of its therapeutic value. For seven patients of this second group, the caloric intake was below the daily requirement. The latter group showed a growth failure in weight {{when they were first}} seen at our center and gained weight when the dietary intake was normalized. However, no biochemical feature of malnutrition was observed in all the 75 children. At the end of the follow-up period, the nutritional status was satisfactory for all of them...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-one adult {{patients}} with chronic hepatitis B and active viral replication {{as indicated by the}} presence of hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg), increased DNA polymerase (DNAp) and positive hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV-DNA) for more than 6 months, were entered into a prospective trial of recombinant human interferon therapy. Ten patients had chronic persistent or <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> hepatitis, 8 <b>chronic</b> active hepatitis and 3 postnecrotic cirrhosis. All cases were treated with 5 x 10 (6) units of recombinant interferon alfa- 2 B given subcutaneously every other day for 12 weeks. During treatment, 18 patients (86 %) showed a significant reduction of DNAp levels, which reached normal values in 10 patients (48 %). Viral replication was controlled over a 10 -month follow-up period in 7 out of 21 patients (33 %). Of these 7, five patients became HBeAg negative and HBeAb positive. HBsAg disappeared in one patient. The only serious adverse effect was thrombocytopenia in one patient in whom rapid recovery occurred when interferon was withdrawn. Treatment was also terminated in a second patient because of local reactions at the injection sites occurring after 10 weeks of therapy. Our data indicate that relatively small doses of recombinant alfa- 2 B interferon given during a 12 -week period induce a significant reduction in viral replication and might approximately triple the spontaneous seroconversion rate observed in {{patients with}} chronic hepatitis B...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{classification}} of chronic hepatitis introduced in 1968 is still current, {{but has been}} modified. The concept of bridging hepatic necrosis has been incorporated, and is recognised as an important feature of both acute and chronic aggressive (active) hepatitis (CAH). In the pathogenesis of the latter, piecemeal necrosis is, however, {{thought to be the}} more important factor. The histo-logical picture of CAH varies widely. Several causes of CAH have been identified, including hep-atitis B virus. Recognition of surface and core components of the virus in tissue sections has facil-itated study of the relationship between host response and pathological lesion in chronic hepatitis. CAH and primary biliary cirrhosis share histological features, and a mixed form has been postulated. Staining for copper sometimes helps to distinguish the two lesions. A third histological category, <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> hepatitis, comprises patients with histological lesions like those of acute hepatitis, but with a chronic or recurrent course. Ten years ago De Groote et al. (1968) emphasised the need to subdivide chronic hepatitis, according to histological criteria, into categories with differing prognosis. The more benign form, chronic per-sistent hepatitis (CPH), was characterised by in-flammation largely confined to portal tracts, with or without superimposed features of acute hepatitis in the lobules. The essentially benign nature of the lesion has since been confirmed (Becker et al., 1970; Chadwick et al., 1977), although progression to more serious liver disease is recorded (Vido et al. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels, we used radioimmunoassay, {{and compared}} {{the results obtained}} with other tests in 231 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection to evaluate its clinical implications. All of these patients were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) -positive. Among them, 38 patients had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 18 had chronic persistent hepatitis, 70 had <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> or active hepatitis (grouped as CAH), 31 had active cirrhosis (AC), 25 had inactive cirrhosis, 20 had decompensated cirrhosis, and 29 were “healthy” HBsAg carriers. Twenty-seven patients with acute hepatitis, 12 with cancer metastasis to the liver, and 81 normal adults served as disease or normal controls. The results showed that serum TBG level increased significantly in patients with CAH, AC, or HCC. Serum TBG did not correlate with albumin or bilirubin level, but correlated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) positively in patients with CAH (p < 0. 001) and negatively in patients with HCC (p < 0. 01) (slope difference p < 0. 05). Serial determination of serum TBG and ALT also showed parallel changes in 15 patients with CAH, but not in nine patients with HCC. In contrast, the fall and rise of serum TBG levels in patients with HCC coincided with tumor resection and recurrence. The data suggest that serum TBG elevation in patients with hepatitis activity {{is the result of}} hepatocellular damage, whereas that in patients with HCC is due to increased synthesis. Whether serum TBG elevation without concomitant rise of ALT {{could be used as a}} marker of HCC awaits further study...|$|R
40|$|Utilizing the {{fluorescent}} antibody method for the histologic demonstration of localized γ-globulins, {{we have made}} the following observations (in contradistinction {{to the lack of}} such findings in a variety of normal and pathologic, control kidneys). In systemic lupus erythematosus (a) γ-globulins were localized in the thickened capillary walls, the "wire-loop" lesions, and the so called "hyaline thrombi" in glomeruli; (b) these sites of localization of γ-globulins were correlated to a considerable degree with the pattern of accentuated eosinophilia of the glomeruli, as seen in hematoxylin-eosin sections, or with the pattern of PAS-positive areas in the glomeruli in sections stained with the periodic acid-Schiff reaction; (c) and γ-globulins were localized rarely in large cytoplasmic granules in tubular epithelium and occasionally in glomerular capsular crescents, tubular protein casts, and inflammatory cells, particularly in the cytoplasm of cells identified as immature and mature plasma cells. In nephrotic glomerulonephritis (a) γ-globulins were localized in the glomerular basement membrane and appertaining structures in chronic membranous glomerulonephritis; (b) γ-globulins were apparently localized in the altered mesangium in <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> glomerulonephritis; and (c) in the tubular protein casts, presumably representing abnormal glomerular filtrates, γ-globulins were present in a lesser concentration and other serum proteins in a greater concentration than found in the glomeruli. In positive lupus erythematosus preparations the nuclei of leukocytes, while undergoing transformation and subsequent phagocytosis to form lupus erythematosus cells, were the sites of localization of γ-globulin (presumably the lupus erythematosus factor) whereas in control preparations no nuclear localization of γ-globulin occurred. These observations are discussed in relation to the pathogenesis of renal lesions in systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic membranous glomerulonephritis, and amyloidosis...|$|R
40|$|The morphologic {{evolution}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) liver disease in 45 hepatic allograft recipients who were HBV surface-antigen positive (HBs-Ag+) {{at the time}} of liver replacement and who survived for more than 60 days was studied by routine histologic and immunocytochemical analysis of serial pathology specimens. The findings in these patients were compared to a control group of 30 individuals who were immune to the HBV (anti-HBs antibody positive), but required hepatic replacement for other reasons. Eight of the forty-five (18 %) HBsAg-positive patients have no serologic evidence of HBV reinfection after transplantation. All 37 remaining patients are reinfected; 21 (47 %) developed chronic active hepatitis and/or cirhosis, 3 (7 %) developed submassive necrosis, and 6 (14 %) developed <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular</b> hepatitis. One patient lost her graft to chronic rejection, despite reinfection with the B virus. Four other patients (9 %) developed a chronic carrier state. No long-term follow-up biopsies were available in the remaining two patients. The histologic features associated with dysfunction related to recurrent HBV infection evolved from an acute to chronic phase and were similar to hepatitis B seen in nonallografted livers. Furthermore HBV-related lesions could be separated from rejection using routine histology alone. The only exception to this conclusion was the occurrence of a peculiar HBV-related lesion in two recipients, described herein. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of viral antigens in almost all cases. Hepatic inflammation also was commonly present during HBV disease and consisted mostly of accessory cells and T lymphocytes. Analysis of the effect of major histocompatibility complex matching revealed no clear association between the number of class I or II matches or mismatches and the development, or pattern, of active hepatitis in the allograft. Peculiar pathologic alterations in several of the biopsies and failed allografts after HBV reinfection suggests that, under special circumstances, the B virus may by cytopathic...|$|R
40|$|This study, {{based upon}} 528 {{laboratory}} examinations and 16 complete autopsies of NZB/Bl mice, deals with autoimmune manifestations (as shown by hypergammaglobulinemia, Coombs positive hemolytic anemia, {{and the occasional}} presence of lupus- and rheumatoid-like factors) and mainly with the pathology and the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis in these mice, a model system of membranous glomerulonephritis with spontaneous and insidious onset, progression through chronic stages, and almost certainly induced by immunological, and autoimmune, mechanisms. The earliest and lasting histological change was hyaline thickening of the capillary walls and adjacent intercapillary regions of the glomerular tufts, corresponding in location to polysaccharide-rich capillary basement membrane and mesangial materials. Distributed focally and diffusely in the glomerular tuft and eventually sparing no glomerulus, hyaline, granular, and fibrillar ("spongy fiber") materials produced narrowing of capillary lumens by concentric or eccentric encroachment upon them. In the later stages hyaline lobulation and sclerosis of the glomerular tufts occurred. Thus the lesions corresponded to those seen in human focal and diffuse membranous, <b>chronic</b> <b>lobular,</b> and lastly (intracapillary) sclerosing glomerulonephritis. In all instances of glomerulonephritis the glomerular tufts contained selective localizations of mouse immunoglobulins corresponding in distribution {{to that of the}} hyaline and (PAS-positive) polysaccharide-rich materials in the focal and diffuse membranous and lobular lesions and in amounts increasing with the severity of glomerular disease. The mouse immunoglobulins were extracted from frozen sections of glomerulonephritic kidneys and were then capable of recombination with glomerular tufts in sections of autologous or isologous glomerulonephritic kidneys from which in vivo localized immunoglobulins had been extracted. The pattern of recombination with glomerular tufts was similar to that of in invo localized immunoglobulins. The extracted immunoglobulins did not show affinity for mouse red cells (in the indirect Coombs test) nor for autologous or isologous cell nuclei (in the immunofluorescence test). The serum of mice with severe glomerulonephritis contained immunoglobulins with in vitro affinity for extracted autologous or isologous glomerular tufts. Thus circulating as well as localized antibodies were demonstrated. The immunogenic materials (autoantigens) may have been formed in the glomerular tufts or accumulated in them from some other source, such as the circulating plasma; however they corresponded in location to polysaccharide-rich capillary basement membrane and mesangial materials. The spleen was identified at the cellular level as the main site of formation of autoantibodies to red cells, as well as the main site of red cell destruction. Some evidence was brought forth suggesting that these autoantibodies were "heavy" or γM-globulins. More studies are in progress...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{characteristics}} of chronic hepatitis in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers with intrahepatic delta antigen, the hepatic histologic findings of 137 patients were reviewed; 101 patients were followed for 2 to 6 years. The predominant liver disease was chronic active hepatitis in 93 patients or cirrhosis in 32; minor forms of <b>chronic</b> persistent or <b>lobular</b> hepatitis were seen in 12 patients. Eight of the 26 patients with an initial diagnosis of cirrhosis died during the follow-up period. Cirrhosis developed in 31 of 75 patients (41 %) without nodular regeneration seen in the first biopsy specimen; 5 of these patients died. Treatment with prednisone or azathioprine did not induce histologic amelioration of delta hepatitis or prevent cirrhosis. Chronic HBsAg hepatitis with intrahepatic expression o...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To assess which {{pathological}} {{features are}} associated with a sensitive marker of liver fibrogenesis and thus of the potential development of fibrosis in hepatitis C. METHODS: The degree of liver fibrogenesis was evaluated by quantification of type I collagen mRNA and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 mRNA (a major profibrogenic cytokine) in liver biopsy specimens from 28 patients with chronic hepatitis C and five controls, using a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Results of mRNA quantification were correlated with histological lesions scored semiquantitatively in the same specimens. RESULTS: Type I collagen mRNA was more strongly expressed in patients than in controls and correlated with the degree of fibrosis, but not with any of the necro-inflammatory lesions (portal inflammation, piecemeal necrosis, and lobular necrosis). TGF beta 1 mRNA concentration was higher in patients than in controls and correlated with histological grade of activity and lobular necrosis. This result was confirmed by in situ hybridisation experiments which showed that TGF beta 1 mRNA was mainly expressed in areas of focal <b>lobular</b> necrosis in <b>chronic</b> hepatitis C. CONCLUSION: This study shows that fibrosis, rather than necro-inflammatory lesions or activity scores, is associated with fibrogenesis and thus with potential aggravation of the fibrous deposit in <b>chronic</b> hepatitis C. <b>Lobular</b> necrosis is an important predictor of prognosis in chronic hepatitis C, as shown by its strong association with TGF beta 1 mRNA expression...|$|R
40|$|Fifty six {{previously}} untreated {{patients who}} had been positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) for more than 1 year with detectable serum levels of hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV-DNA) and a liver biopsy performed in the 6 months before enrollment, were randomized to receive recombinant alpha- 2 a interferon at doses of 3 MU intramuscolarly thrice weekly for 6 months or no treatment. Treated and untreated patients had similar clinical characteristics in terms of ALT elevation, HBV-DNA levels, and degree of liver damage. Twenty one had <b>chronic</b> persistent or <b>lobular</b> hepatitis; 28 had chronic active hepatitis and 7 had cirrhosis. The percentages of patients who lost HBeAg at month 6, 12 and 18 were 22 %, 32 % and 38 % in the treated group, and 16 %, 20 % and 37 % in the controls (differences = ns). At the same time intervals, HBV-DNA detected by dot spot hybridization, cleared off in 39 %, 39 % and 41 % of treated patients as compared to 16 %, 36 % and 37 % of controls (difference = p < 0. 05 for HBV-DNA clearance at month 6). At the end of follow-up, 12 treated patients (41 %, including 8 antiHBe seroconverters) and 10 untreated controls (42 %, including 6 anti-HBe seroconverters) had normal aminotransferase levels. Conclusions show that in patients with chronic hepatitis B, clearance of HBV-DNA but not of HBeAg was hastened by a 6 -month treatment with low doses of recombinant alpha- 2 a interferon...|$|R
