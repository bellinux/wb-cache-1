5|$|As a collegiate university, Oxford's {{structure}} can be <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> those {{unfamiliar with}} it. The university is a federation, comprising over forty self-governing colleges and halls, {{along with a}} central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor.|$|E
5|$|Enron's complex {{financial}} statements were <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> shareholders and analysts. In addition, its complex business model and unethical practices {{required that the}} company use accounting limitations to misrepresent earnings and modify the balance sheet to indicate favorable performance.|$|E
5|$|After North-Beveland had {{surrendered}} on 18 May, Zeeuws-Vlaanderen was {{the last}} remaining unoccupied Dutch homeland territory. On orders of the French, all Dutch troops were withdrawn on 19 May to Ostend in Belgium, as their presence would be demoralising and <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> their own forces. On 27 May all of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen had been occupied.|$|E

5|$|Karas won the Best Original Video at the 2006 Tokyo Anime Award competition, {{and most}} reviewers were {{impressed}} with the images produced by fusing 2D and 3D art techniques. The story presents themes on the conflicts between cultural traditions and modern society, {{and the relationship between}} people. Reviewers, however, found its presentation was too <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> follow; several of them felt it worsened the show by detracting from the strength of its art.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Tongan mission {{president}} John H. Groberg {{declared that}} a 50th Anniversary Golden Jubilee would be held. The concept for the celebration was <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> church members {{as it was}} unclear what the 50th anniversary was honoring. Groberg was not quite sure himself. However, several years prior to his appointment as mission president, Groberg received inspiration that he would preside over the mission in Tonga and hold a 50th anniversary jubilee during his term. A {{few months before the}} celebration, which was scheduled for November, Groberg received a letter from the widow of Tonga's first mission president. In the letter, she shared that the mission's first conference was held in November 1918. The anniversary of the Tonga's first mission-wide conference became the reason for the jubilee.|$|E
5|$|In a {{symbolic}} act, the first rivet placed into the skin, fixing a copper plate onto the statue's big toe, {{was driven by}} United States Ambassador to France Levi P. Morton. The skin was not, however, crafted in exact sequence from low to high; work proceeded {{on a number of}} segments simultaneously in a manner often <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> visitors. Some work was performed by contractors—one of the fingers was made to Bartholdi's exacting specifications by a coppersmith in the southern French town of Montauban. By 1882, the statue was complete up to the waist, an event Barthodi celebrated by inviting reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue. Laboulaye died in 1883. He was succeeded as chairman of the French committee by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez Canal. The completed statue was formally presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris on July 4, 1884, and de Lesseps announced that the French government had agreed to pay for its transport to New York. The statue remained intact in Paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal; by January 1885, this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage.|$|E

25|$|Motorcycles must be {{leaned in}} order to make turns. This lean is induced by the method known as countersteering, in which the rider {{momentarily}} steers the handlebars in the direction opposite of the desired turn. This practice is counterintuitive and therefore often <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> novices and even many experienced motorcyclists.|$|E
6000|$|I {{felt this}} to be very true but was too <b>confused</b> <b>to</b> attend to it.

25|$|Anatomical {{terminology}} uses many unique terms, suffixes, and prefixes {{deriving from}} Ancient Greek and Latin. These terms can be <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> those unfamiliar with them, {{but can be}} more precise reducing ambiguity and errors. Also, since these anatomical terms are not used in everyday conversation, their meanings {{are less likely to}} change, and less likely to be misinterpreted.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{editors at}} DC Comics felt that its {{characters}} and their history had become convoluted and <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> casual readers. In 1985, DC published Crisis on Infinite Earths, which rewrote {{the history of}} the DC Universe. DC had been planning to revamp Superman for some time, and Crisis gave the company freedom to reset the character from the very beginning.|$|E
25|$|Usually laid along a road, the 'Z' ambush {{was both}} {{effective}} and <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> the unit being ambushed. This complicated ambush was usually well planned with low bunkers lining the kill zone, often prepared {{months prior to}} the ambush. The ambush position was only occupied after word was received that an enemy battalion or larger unit would be using the road, which passed through the ambush site.|$|E

25|$|Kurumada once stated that, at first, Athena was {{not going}} to exist as a character. She was rather going to be {{experienced}} individually by each of the protagonists in different spiritual ways. Later, he thought this concept would be <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> readers and difficult to use, so he decided to integrate her into his manga as a character, with her own traits and personality.|$|E
25|$|As {{the rules}} of usage for the IJ differ from those that apply to the many other digraphs in the Dutch languagein some {{situations}} behaving more as a single ligature or letter than a digraphthe IJ is not only <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> foreigners, but also a source of discussion among native speakers of Dutch. Its actual usage in the Netherlands and in Flanders (Belgium) sometimes differs from the official recommendations.|$|E

25|$|Because {{double and}} single track may use {{different}} signalling systems, {{it may be}} awkward and <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> mix double and single track too often. For example, intermediate mechanical signal boxes on a double-track line can be closed during periods of light traffic, but this cannot be done {{if there is a}} single-line section in between. This problem is less serious with electrical signalling such as Centralized traffic control.|$|E
25|$|These {{changes were}} {{reportedly}} so <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> some motormen that on November 28, 1967, a motorman intending {{to operate a}} train along the new D route via Grand Street accidentally took his train to Canal Street, necessitating the discharge of 800 passengers from the train during a busy rush hour. Reaction among passengers was mixed, with one passenger hugging a conductor after {{the opening of the}} new Grand Street station in Manhattan, while another passenger complained about having to take a slow local train in Brooklyn.|$|E
25|$|The V-1 {{flying bomb}} was first {{launched}} against London on 13 June, and soon grew to a threat {{much larger than}} the Luftwaffes bombers. A defensive system was quickly arranged and went into operation on 15 June, but the overlapping operational areas of the anti-aircraft guns and fighters proved to be <b>confusing</b> <b>to</b> all involved. After talking to Frederick Alfred Pile, General of the Army's AA units, Air Marshal Roderic Hill re-arranged the AA guns in a thin belt along the coast, with the fighters operating inland. This greatly improved the operations by both forces.|$|E

25|$|Although in {{the past}} several {{attempts}} have been made to synonymise many of the proposed names, the taxonomic position of West African wolves, in particular, is too <b>confused</b> <b>to</b> come to any precise conclusion, as the collected study materials are few. Prior to 1840, six of the ten supposed West African subspecies were named or classed almost entirely because of their fur colour.|$|R
