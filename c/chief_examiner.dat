25|$|Although a Confucian, the Hongwu Emperor {{had a deep}} {{distrust}} for the scholar-officials of the gentry {{class and}} was not afraid to have them beaten in court for offenses. In favor of Confucian learning and the civil service, the emperor ordered every county magistrate to open a Confucian school in 1369—following the tradition of a nationwide school system first established by Emperor Ping of Han (9 BC–5 AD). However, he halted the civil service examinations in 1373 after complaining that the 120 scholar-officials who obtained a jinshi degree were incompetent ministers. After the examinations were reinstated in 1384, he had the <b>chief</b> <b>examiner</b> executed after {{it was discovered that}} he allowed only candidates from the south to be granted jinshi degrees. In 1380, the Hongwu Emperor had the Chancellor Hu Weiyong executed upon suspicion of a conspiracy plot to overthrow him; after that the emperor abolished the Chancellery and assumed this role as chief executive and emperor. With a growing amount of suspicion for his ministers and subjects, the Hongwu Emperor established the Jinyiwei, a network of secret police drawn from his own palace guard. They were partly responsible for the loss of 100,000 lives in several major purges over three decades of his rule.|$|E
500|$|At first, the act {{applied only}} to 10% of federal jobs and, without proper {{implementation}} by the president, it could have gone no further. [...] Even after he signed the act into law, its proponents doubted Arthur's commitment to reform. [...] To their surprise, he acted quickly to appoint {{the members of the}} Civil Service Commission that the law created, naming reformers Dorman Bridgman Eaton, John Milton Gregory, and Leroy D. Thoman as commissioners. [...] The <b>chief</b> <b>examiner,</b> Silas W. Burt, was a long-time reformer who had been Arthur's opponent when the two men worked at the New York Customs House. [...] The commission issued its first rules in May 1883; by 1884, half of all postal officials and three-quarters of the Customs Service jobs were to be awarded by merit. [...] That year, Arthur expressed satisfaction with the new system, praising its effectiveness [...] "in securing competent and faithful public servants and in protecting the appointing officers of the Government from the pressure of personal importunity and from the labor of examining the claims and pretensions of rival candidates for public employment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Benign {{colonialism}} is {{a supposed}} form of colonialism in which benefits outweighed risks for indigenous populations whose lands, resources, {{rights and freedoms}} were preempted by a colonising nation-state. The historical source for the concept of benign colonialism resides with John Stuart Mill who was <b>chief</b> <b>examiner</b> of the British East India Company dealing with British interests in India in the 1820s and 1830s. Mill's most well-known essays on benign colonialism are found in [...] "Essays on some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Peacock often {{appeared}} before parliamentary committees as the company's champion. In this role in 1834, he resisted James Silk Buckingham's claim to compensation for his expulsion from the East Indies, and in 1836, he defeated the {{attack of the}} Liverpool merchants and Cheshire manufacturers upon the Indian salt monopoly. In 1836 his official career was crowned by his appointment as <b>Chief</b> <b>Examiner</b> of Indian Correspondence, in succession to James Mill. The post was one which could only be filled by someone of sound business capacity and exceptional ability in drafting official documents: and Peacock's discharge of its duties, it is believed, suffered nothing by comparison either with his distinguished predecessor or his still more celebrated successor, Stuart Mill. In 1837 appeared his Paper Money Lyrics and other Poems of which only one hundred copies were printed. Also in 1837, Headlong Hall, Nightmare Abbey, Maid Marian, and Crotchet Castle appeared together as vol. 57 of Bentley's Standard Novels. [...] In 1839 and 1840 Peacock superintended the construction of iron steamers which rounded the Cape, and {{took part in the}} Chinese war.|$|E
