5|$|Even {{after the}} album had been completed, Collins was unhappy about leaving the drumkit to sing lead, {{and the band}} were unsure he would be <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> {{frontman}} on tour. The group decided to try anyway, and needed someone to drum while Collins was singing. Collins insisted on choosing the touring drummer himself, selecting Bill Bruford, who he had already worked with in Brand X. Collins continued to drum during instrumental sections.|$|E
5|$|Frank McNamara made a bed {{of leaves}} for the {{survivor}} and built a fire to help keep him as warm and <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> possible. McNamara stayed with the survivor while Inkpen went to summon help. After several hours, ambulance crews arrived and administered first-aid and morphia. Rescue workers constructed a stretcher using saplings, bandages and overcoats. They covered the survivor with an overcoat and carried him for two hours to cover about two miles through thickly wooded country to McNamara's utility truck, which then carried him and his rescuers to a waiting ambulance.|$|E

25|$|Tennyson was {{the first}} to be raised to a British peerage for his writing.

25|$|Paris was {{occupied}} by the Germans during World War II. Many Allied citizens were interned, and Dolores (born in England and married to an American) was detained at the German internment camp at Vittel.

Vittel was a former hotel and spa, and relatively <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> internment camps went.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} after electrification, and the {{consequent}} removal of diesel locomotives from passenger services, Class 317 electrical multiple units operated all services out of King's Lynn; while they were not as <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> the previous fleet of locomotive-hauled coaches, they quickly developed a reputation for reliability. Today's services are mostly operated by Class 387s. Abellio Greater Anglia operate weekday peak-hour services between King's Lynn and London Liverpool Street using Class 379s.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{it can be}} {{observed}} that many companies {{try to make the}} workplace as <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> possible for the employees. This is achieved by light flooded rooms, Feng Shui methods in the workplace or even by creative jobs. The efficiency and creativity of the employees is to be promoted by a pleasant atmosphere at the workplace. Approaches of the Scientific Management, in which attempts are also made to make the work environment pleasant, are partly recognizable here.|$|E

25|$|However, facsimiles of Minter's passionate {{letters to}} Taylor were printed in newspapers, forever {{shattering}} her screen {{image as a}} modest and wholesome young girl. Minter was vilified in the press. She made four more films for Paramount, and when the studio failed to renew her contract, she received offers from many other producers. Never <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> an actress, Minter declined them all. In 1957, she married Brandon O. Hildebrandt, a wealthy Danish-American businessman. She died in wealthy obscurity in Santa Monica, California, on 4 August 1984.|$|E
25|$|The {{technically}} more advanced, stationary vertical looms {{are used}} in villages and town manufactures. The more advanced types of vertical looms are more <b>comfortable,</b> <b>as</b> they allow for the weavers to retain their position throughout the entire weaving process. The Tabriz type of vertical loom allows for weaving of carpets up to double {{the length of the}} loom, while there is no limit to the length of the carpet that can be woven on a vertical roller beam loom. In essence, the width of the carpet is limited by the length of the loom beams.|$|E
25|$|The {{three other}} {{survivors}} were many miles from a settlement and {{were forced to}} survive on shell fish and dead penguins cast up by the sea.

Simpson and Mitchell were eventually found seventeen days after the disaster in a terrible state, slowly making their way to the Cape Borda Lightstation. They were without food, having given all they possessed to Kilpatrick, but the remains of two dead penguins were tied around their necks.|$|E

25|$|Yet {{another reason}} is the {{economic}} clout generated by this class. In 2005 according to U.S.Census statistics, the top third of society, excluding the top 5%, controlled the largest share of income in the United States. Although some in the statistical middle class (for example, police officers and fire fighters in the more affluent suburbs in the San Francisco Bay Area) may have lifestyles as <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> those found among {{the ranks of the}} professional middle class, only few have the same degree of autonomy and influence over society as those in the professional middle class. Other white-collar members of the statistical middle class may not only be unable to afford the middle-class lifestyle but also lack the influence found in the professional middle class.|$|E
25|$|Carpets {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} insulating a person's feet from a cold tile or concrete floor, making a room more <b>comfortable</b> <b>as</b> a place to sit on the floor (e.g., when playing with children or as a prayer rug), reducing sound from walking (particularly in apartment buildings) and adding decoration or colour to a room. Carpets can be made in any colour by using differently dyed fibers. Carpets can have many different types of patterns and motifs used to decorate the surface. In the 2000s, carpets are used in industrial and commercial establishments such as retail stores and hotels and in private homes. In the 2010s, a huge range of carpets and rugs are available at many price and quality levels, ranging from inexpensive, synthetic carpets that are mass-produced in factories and used in commercial buildings to costly hand-knotted wool rugs which are used in private homes of wealthy families.|$|E
25|$|Girton's first library, the Stanley library, was {{established}} in 1884 with a donation from Lady Stanley of Alderley. It {{was considered to be}} luxurious and <b>comfortable,</b> <b>as</b> it contained stained-glass windows, leather furniture and a large chimney. Books were acquired mostly through donations. By 1932 the collection had become so large that a new library was opened. Designed by Michael Waterhouse, descendant of the architects Paul Waterhouse and Alfred Waterhouse, the new library consisted of an upper reading room, crafted in oak, and a ground floor, in which the book collections are held. An annexe containing archives was added in 1967. The Duke building, a modern library extension offering IT facilities and a reading room, was opened in 2005. Named after Alison Duke, a fellow and major donor, the building was designed by Allies and Morrison. It won a national RIBA award in 2006, a SCONUL Library Design Award in 2007, and a Civic Trust Award in 2007.|$|E
