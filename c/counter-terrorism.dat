5|$|The ADF shares {{responsibility}} for <b>counter-terrorism</b> with civilian law enforcement agencies. Under the Australian National <b>Counter-Terrorism</b> Plan the State and Territory police and emergency services have the primary {{responsibility for}} responding to any terrorist incidents on Australian territory. If a terrorist threat or the consequences of an incident are beyond the capacity of civilian authorities to resolve the ADF may be 'called out' to provide support. To meet its <b>counter-terrorism</b> responsibilities the ADF maintains two elite Tactical Assault Groups, the Special Operations Engineer Regiment {{as well as a}} company-sized high readiness group in each Army Reserve brigade and the 1st Commando Regiment. While these forces provide a substantial <b>counter-terrorism</b> capability, the ADF does not regard domestic security as being part of its 'core business'.|$|E

5|$|On July 11, 2009, CIA Director Leon Panetta {{told the}} Senate and House {{intelligence}} committees that the CIA withheld {{information about a}} secret <b>counter-terrorism</b> program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from Cheney. Intelligence and Congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the CIA interrogation program and did not involve domestic intelligence activities. They have said the program was started by the <b>counter-terrorism</b> center at the CIA shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, but never became fully operational, involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until this year. The Wall Street Journal reported, citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter, that the program {{was an attempt to}} carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives.|$|E

5|$|Though not {{the first}} of its kind, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six started a popular trend of {{tactical}} first-person shooters in 1998. It featured a team-based, realistic design and themes based around <b>counter-terrorism,</b> requiring missions to be planned before execution and in it, a single hit was sometimes enough to kill a character. Medal of Honor, released in 1999, started a long running proliferation of first-person shooters set during World War II.|$|E
5|$|A stealth {{game is a}} type {{of video}} game that tasks the player with using stealth to avoid or {{overcome}} antagonists. Games in the genre typically allow the player to remain undetected by hiding, using disguises or avoiding noise. Some games allow the player to choose between a stealthy approach or directly attacking antagonists, but mostly rewarding the player for greater levels of stealth. The genre has employed espionage, <b>counter-terrorism</b> and rogue themes, with protagonists who are special forces operatives, spies, thieves, ninjas, and assassins. Some games have also combined stealth elements with other genres, such as first-person shooters and even platformers.|$|E
5|$|Captain Sharif Ali bin Zeid, 34, a Jordanian {{military}} intelligence officer, {{was killed in}} the attack. He was the Jordanian handler of al-Balawi and the liaison between him and the CIA. Bin Zeid was a cousin to King Abdullah II of Jordan. Bin Zeid's wake was held in the Royal Palace. King Abdullah II and Queen Rania attended his funeral. Official Jordanian news reports said that he died while performing humanitarian service in Afghanistan. His death shed light on the U.S.-Jordanian intelligence partnership, which is rarely acknowledged publicly, yet seen by U.S. officials as highly important for their <b>counter-terrorism</b> strategy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Singapore went through some post-independence crises, {{including}} the SARS outbreak in 2003 {{and the threat}} of terrorism. In December 2001, a plot to bomb embassies and other infrastructure in Singapore was uncovered and as many as 36 members of the Jemaah Islamiyah group were arrested under the Internal Security Act. Major <b>counter-terrorism</b> measures were put in place to detect and prevent potential terrorist acts and to minimise damages should they occur. More emphasis was placed on promoting social integration and trust between the different communities.|$|E
5|$|Parts of New Labour's {{political}} philosophy linked crime with social exclusion and pursued policies to encourage partnerships between social and police authorities to lower crime rates. Other areas of New Labour's policy maintained a traditional approach to crime; {{the prison population}} in 2005 rose to over 76,000, mostly owing to the increasing length of sentences. Following the September 11 attacks, the Labour government attempted to emphasise <b>counter-terrorism</b> measures. From 2002, the government followed policies aimed at reducing anti-social behaviour; in the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, Labour introduced Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs).|$|E

5|$|The United States {{responded to}} the attack by {{increasing}} its drone attacks against militants in Pakistan. Nearly every day after the CIA facility was attacked, the U.S. military conducted drone strikes aimed at leaders of the Haqqani network in North Waziristan. In the week after the attack, the U.S. military conducted five drone strikes, an unusually high number. However, U.S. <b>counter-terrorism</b> officials cautioned against linking these attacks to the bombing. After reports of drone strikes, Pakistan {{said it would not}} support the attacks in its territory, as they were counterproductive.|$|E

5|$|Dutch <b>counter-terrorism</b> agency NCTb {{said that}} it had started a probe into where the suspect originated. Dutch {{officials}} also said that they will now use 3D full-body scanning X-ray technology on flights departing to the U.S., despite protests from privacy advocates. Dutch officials said that security must take priority over {{the privacy of the}} individuals being scanned, but the scanners are not designed to compromise an individual's privacy, as the imagery resolution is only high enough to detect non-metallic objects under clothing, such as powdered explosives. Members of the Second Chamber (Lower House) of the Dutch parliament demanded an explanation from Minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin, asking how the suspect managed to smuggle explosives on board, despite Schiphol's reportedly strict security measures.|$|E
5|$|It is the {{eleventh}} {{entry in the}} Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series and the successor to , a tactical shooter that had a larger focus on narrative. However, Patriots was eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, and the team decided to reboot the franchise. The team evaluated {{the core of the}} Rainbow Six franchise and believed that letting players impersonate the top counter-terrorist operatives around the world suited the game most. To create authentic siege situations, the team consulted actual <b>counter-terrorism</b> units, and looked at real-life examples of sieges. Powered by AnvilNext 2.0, the game also utilizes Ubisoft's RealBlast technology to create destructible environments.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner had a rocky {{relationship}} with the United States. Several items from a US air force plane, such as drugs and GPS devices, were seized by Argentine officials, which caused a diplomatic crisis. US State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley {{said that they were}} standard tools used in <b>counter-terrorism</b> tactics which were being taught to the Argentine police during the joint operation, and asked for the return of the seized materials. Kirchner blamed the whole country for the 2014 default, ruled by US judge Thomas P. Griesa. She said in a cadena nacional ("national network") address that the US may be trying to oust her from power, or even assassinate her. She said this a few days after accusing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant of similar assassination plans against her. The idea was rejected by opposition leader Elisa Carrió as a mere conspiracy theory.|$|E
5|$|Revelations is set between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, {{shortly after}} the {{establishment}} of the <b>counter-terrorism</b> group Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA).

5|$|The {{first series}} of the British spy drama {{television}} series Spooks (known as MI-5 in the United States) began broadcasting on 13 May 2002 on BBC One, before ending on 17 June 2002. It consists of six episodes. Spooks follows the actions of Section D, a <b>counter-terrorism</b> division of the British Security Services (MI5). Among the storylines, main character Tom Quinn faces dilemmas living a double life with his girlfriend, who at first does not know he is really a spy, and Tessa Phillips is running phantom agents for monetary gain. Matthew Macfadyen, Keeley Hawes, David Oyelowo, Peter Firth, Jenny Agutter, Lisa Faulkner, Esther Hall, Heather Cave, Hugh Simon and Greame Mearns are listed as the main cast.|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{series of}} the BBC espionage {{television}} series Spooks (known as MI-5 in the United States) began broadcasting on 27 October 2008 on BBC One before ending on 8 December 2008 on the same channel, and consists of eight episodes, two fewer than previous series. It follows the actions of Section D, a <b>counter-terrorism</b> division in MI5. The primary storyline involves Sugarhorse, a top secret operation set up by MI5 during {{the final years of}} the Cold War, and a mole working for the FSB who intends to leak the operation to the Russians. Peter Firth, Rupert Penry-Jones, Hermione Norris, Richard Armitage, Miranda Raison, Gemma Jones, Hugh Simon and Alex Lanipekun are credited as the main cast.|$|E
5|$|The third {{series of}} the British spy drama {{television}} series Spooks (known as MI-5 in the United States) began broadcasting on 11 October 2004 on BBC One, before ending on 13 December 2004.

5|$|Throughout the writing, {{and also}} the filming stages of the series, the writers were advised by ex-MI5 {{officers}} who gave insight into how the characters operate and how their personal lives {{would be affected by}} it. Among the advisors were Nick Day, who worked in <b>counter-terrorism</b> in the Security Services, Viktor Abramkin, a UK-based former KGB officer, and Mike Baker, an ex-CIA agent. When including terrorists, the BBC often has the responsibility to portray people with as much balance as possible for both sides. The first series finale was heavily researched, as the episode was based on real life instances in which terrorists agreed to work with the authorities in Colombia. Meanwhile, a scene in which Tom and Patrick strip naked to ensure they are not bugged came from the producers' sources. The sources also advised the producers how to tail targets without being spotted.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years after}} the Battle of New York, Steve Rogers works in Washington, D.C. for the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. under Director Nick Fury, while {{adjusting}} to contemporary society. Rogers and Agent Natasha Romanoff are sent with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s <b>counter-terrorism</b> S.T.R.I.K.E. team, led by Agent Rumlow, to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from Georges Batroc and his mercenaries. Mid-mission, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers for Fury. Rogers returns to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, to confront Fury and is briefed about Project Insight: three Helicarriers linked to spy satellites, designed to preemptively eliminate threats. Unable to decrypt the data recovered by Romanoff, Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official Alexander Pierce to delay the project.|$|E
5|$|U.S. President Caldwell assigns Fisher, his {{colleague}} Charlie Cole, CIA agent Isaac Briggs and Anna Grímsdóttir to Fourth Echelon, a new special-ops and <b>counter-terrorism</b> unit. Charged with stopping the Engineers, the group uses the cargo plane Paladin as its command center. Fourth Echelon first aims to secure Andriy Kobin, a CIA hostage believed to possess {{information on the}} Engineers. Fisher extracts him from a safe house in Benghazi, and learns that his associates have ties to the Engineers. Infiltrating an insurgent stronghold, he finds an executed U.S. soldier and learns from a video recording that the executioner is Majid Sadiq; a former MI6 agent, Sadiq demands the Fourth Echelon to stop interfering.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{as part of}} an {{expansion}} of the number of Australian Army infantry battalions, the 2nd/4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment—then operating as a standard light infantry battalion—was delinked into separate battalions which resumed their original identities as the 2nd and 4th Battalions. The decision was then taken that the 4th Battalion would become a Regular Army commando unit and on 1 February 1997 the unit was renamed to 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) (4 RAR Cdo). The unit would be structured for both conventional operations and domestic <b>counter-terrorism,</b> with an initial establishment of a battalion headquarters, Tactical Assault Group, two commando companies, logistic support company, logistic support company, operational support company and a signal squadron. Regular serving members were given the opportunity to undertake special forces training provided by the Commando Training Wing of the Reserve 1st Commando Regiment, or elect to be posted to a conventional forces unit. No General Reserve positions existed in the new structure, and reserve members discharged or posted to reserve units. It was planned that 4 RAR (Cdo) would eventually take over the SASR counter terrorist role.|$|E
5|$|Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum <b>counter-terrorism</b> consultant, {{contacts}} {{the player}} and claims that Citadel Station's mining laser is being powered up to attack Earth. SHODAN's {{plan is to}} destroy all major cities on the planet, {{in a bid to}} become a kind of god. Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the laser, and promises to destroy the records of the hacker's incriminating exchange with Diego if the strike is stopped. With information gleaned from log discs, the hacker destroys the laser by firing it into Citadel Station's own shields. Foiled by the hacker's work, SHODAN prepares to seed Earth with a mutagenic virus—the same one responsible for turning the station's crew into mutants. The hacker, while attempting to jettison the chambers used to cultivate the virus, confronts and defeats Diego, who has been transformed into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN. Next, SHODAN begins an attempt to upload itself into Earth's computer networks. Following Rebecca's advice, the hacker prevents the download's completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{withdrawal}} from Vietnam brought {{to an end}} the doctrine of 'forward defence' through involvement in Southeast Asian wars. Instead, the Australian military's new focus was on the defence of continental Australia against external attack. In line with this change, the SASR {{took the lead in}} developing the Australian Army's capability to conduct patrol operations in Northern Australia. It was later recognised that this role required dedicated units with the Army forming three Regional Force Surveillance Units in the early 1980s trained by the SASR. In July 1977 two SASR patrols were deployed to north Irian Jaya with the approval of Indonesian authorities to provide first aid to the survivors of an RAAF Iroquois helicopter which had crashed in the remote jungle during survey operations, and to secure the wreckage from possibly being captured by members of the OPM independence movement. During this time the SASR also continued to train overseas with other special forces units. On one such exercise in the Philippines, a US special forces C-130 Hercules crashed into the South China Sea shortly after take-off from Subic Bay on 26 February 1981, killing 23 passengers including three Australians from the SASR, {{as well as a number}} of Americans, Filipinos, and New Zealanders. Meanwhile, following the Sydney Hilton bombing in February 1978, the SASR was given responsibility for providing Australia's military <b>counter-terrorism</b> response force, for which 2 Squadron was raised again in 1982. In addition to being able to respond to terrorist attacks in Australian cities, the SASR <b>counter-terrorism</b> unit was required to develop a capability to board ships underway and off-shore oil platforms together with clearance divers from the Navy Clearance Diving Branch. In May 1987 a squadron from the SASR was alerted for a possible deployment to Fiji as part of Operation Morris Dance, but did not leave Australia. The regiment was not involved in operations during the Gulf War in 1991 although two troops were again placed on standby for deployment at short notice, while other elements remained on high alert to respond to a terrorist incident in Australia if required.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{years were}} {{busy with the}} unit {{creating}} a structure and recruiting members suitable for commando training, while conducting sub-unit and unit training activities. B Company was raised in 1997, followed by C Company in 1999, both of which took 24 months to reach full maturity. A small team from 4 RAR (Cdo) deployed to East Timor {{as part of the}} International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) in September 1999 providing close personal protection for the media and also as interpreters in the initial months. In 2000, elements were involved in the evacuation of Australian nationals from the Solomon Islands in June. While later that year, 4 RAR (Cdo) assisted with <b>counter-terrorism</b> at the Sydney Olympic Games as part of Joint Task Force 114, with C Company on standby as a response force such as providing a cordon around an incident site in support of the SASR. In 2000, it was decided that the counter terrorist role should remain with the SASR. A period of rapid capability development, equipment acquisition and training subsequently followed. The unit that was developed as a result is highly regarded by coalition special operation forces abroad, and has conducted operations in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. It has also been awarded a number of citations for bravery and meritorious service.|$|E
5|$|United States Army Special Forces (SF) aka Green Berets perform several doctrinal missions: {{unconventional}} warfare, foreign internal defense, special reconnaissance, {{direct action}} and <b>counter-terrorism.</b> These missions make Special Forces {{unique in the}} U.S. military, because they are employed throughout the three stages of the operational continuum: peacetime, conflict and war. Foreign internal defense operations, SF's main peacetime mission, {{are designed to help}} friendly developing nations by working with their military and police forces to improve their technical skills, understanding of human rights issues, and to help with humanitarian and civic action projects. Special Forces unconventional warfare capabilities provide a viable military option for a variety of operational taskings that are inappropriate or infeasible for conventional forces. Special Forces are the U.S. military's premier unconventional warfare force. Foreign internal defense and unconventional warfare missions are the bread and butter of Special Forces soldiers. For this reason SF candidates are trained extensively in weapons, engineering, communications and medicine. SF soldiers are taught to be warriors first and teachers second because they must be able to train their team and be able to train their allies during a FID or UW mission. Often SF units are required to perform additional, or collateral, activities outside their primary missions. These collateral activities are coalition warfare/support, combat search and rescue, security assistance, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, humanitarian de-mining and counter-drug operations.|$|E
