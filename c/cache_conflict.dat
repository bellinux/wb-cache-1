50|$|Copker in Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2014 {{presented}} another cache-based solution against cold-boot attacks for public-key cryptographic computations. Public-key cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, requires {{much more}} memory space than symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES. Copker employs the WB (Write-Back) cache mode to keep data in caches. The WB cache mode {{is the most}} common mode; that is, modified data are not synchronized from caches into the RAM until explicit or implicit write-back operations. RSA computations are conducted with private keys in memory under the WB cache mode; then, sensitive private keys are kept in caches. Then, Copker finished the following mechanisms to prevent the sensitive private keys from being synchronized into RAM. (1) Eliminate heap variables, and only static variables are used in the computations; switching stack to pre-allocated data variables. So all used data variables are stored in reserved address space within caches, - no <b>cache</b> <b>conflict</b> among these data. (2) Task scheduling and kernel preemption are disabled. So, the RSA computations are not suspended; otherwise, the states of suspended tasks may be swapped into RAM. (3) All other cores are forced to enter the No-Fill cache mode. In such mode, read misses do not cause cache replacement (data are read either from another core that holds the newest copy of the data, or directly from RAM), and write misses access RAM directly. Hence, the cores sharing caches with the Copker core that are executing RSA computations, are forced to enter the no-fill mode, so that they cannot evict Copker’s caches.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, a novel SIMD {{extension}} called Modified MMX (MMMX) for multimedia computing is presented. Specifically, the MMX {{architecture is}} enhanced with the extended subwords and the matrix register file techniques. The extended subwords technique uses SIMD registers that are {{wider than the}} packed format used to store the data. The extended subwords technique avoids data type conversion overhead and increases parallelism in SIMD architectures. This is because promoting the subwords of the source SIMD registers to larger subwords {{before they can be}} processed and demoting the results again before they can be written back to memory incurs conversion overhead. The matrix register file technique allows to load data that is stored consecutively in memory into a column of the register file, where a column corresponds to the corresponding subwords of different registers. In other words, this technique provides both row-wise as well as column-wise accesses to the media register file. It is a useful approach for matrix operations that are common in multimedia processing. In addition, in this work, new and general SIMD instructions addressing the multimedia application domain are investigated. It does not consider an ISA that is application specific. For example, special-purpose instructions are synthesized using a few general-purpose SIMD instructions. The performance of the MMMX architecture is compared to the performance of the MMX/SSE architecture for different multimedia applications and kernels using the sim-outorder simulator of the SimpleScalar toolset. Additionally, three issues related to the efficient implementation of the 2 D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) on general-purpose processors, in particular the Pentium 4, are discussed. These are 64 K aliasing, <b>cache</b> <b>conflict</b> misses, and SIMD vectorization. 64 K aliasing is a phenomenon that happens on the Pentium 4, which can degrade performance by an order of magnitude. It occurs if two or more data items whose addresses differ by a multiple of 64 K need to be cached simultaneously. There are also many <b>cache</b> <b>conflict</b> misses in the implementation of vertical filtering of the DWT, if the filter length exceeds the number of cache ways. In this dissertation, techniques are proposed to avoid 64 K aliasing and to mitigate <b>cache</b> <b>conflict</b> misses.
