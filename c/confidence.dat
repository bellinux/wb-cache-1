5|$|At present, it is {{not clear}} what {{evidence}} the President may rely on to be satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the <b>confidence</b> of a majority of MPs, as the Singapore courts have not yet had to decide the issue. In the Sarawak case of Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg, decided on provisions similar to those in the Singapore Constitution, the court found that the phrase ceased to command the <b>confidence</b> of a majority of the Members of Parliament was a term of art which had to be signified by a formal vote of no <b>confidence</b> taken by the legislature. In contrast, a Sabah court held in Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah that loss of <b>confidence</b> could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative vote. This might include, for instance, media reports or letters addressed to the President.|$|E

5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking <b>confidence</b> and command, and {{uncertain}} when he had the ball at his feet. In time he matured, with his <b>confidence</b> and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.|$|E

5|$|On April 23, 2008, amid {{complaints}} {{directed toward}} CIA president Tim Ryan, the school's teachers' union approved {{a vote of}} no <b>confidence,</b> with a vote of 85 to 9.

The largest complaints, {{laid out in a}} thirteen-item list, included outdated technology, poorly-designed uniforms, poor-quality classes and dining hall meals, excessive tuition, students admitted with no chance of succeeding, substandard school-brand kitchen equipment, overcrowded classes and residence halls, complicated schedules, and poor record-keeping. The document described President Ryan as taking an autocratic style, ignoring staff input, and retaliating against criticism. Ryan later met with union representatives and described coming improvements in scheduling and curriculum. Immediately after the faculty's vote of no <b>confidence,</b> the board of trustees unanimously voted to their <b>confidence</b> and support of Ryan and extended his contract.|$|E
