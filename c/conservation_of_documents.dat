40|$|Abstract. The {{knowledge}} of past events {{is important for}} the assessment of debris-flow hazard. Amongst the sources of information, documents from historical archives are particularly important in sites where the debris flows cause damage to urban areas and transportation routes. The paper analyses the availability of historical documents on debris flows in Northeastern Italy and discusses factors that can influence the building of time series from archive data both at regional and single basin scales. An increased number of debris flows was observed in the studied region for the last decades. This could be due both to an increased frequency of the events and to a larger availability of information: the analysis carried out indicates that the latter factor is probably the most influencing. The importance of factors, which affect the collection of data, including the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and the presence and fragility of the elements at risk, is stressed in view of a wise use of historical data on debris flows...|$|E

An {{important component of the}} skill <b>of</b> <b>document</b> <b>conservation</b> is delicate hands-on manipulations. As with medical procedural training, there is a great need for better ways to train document conservators in these skills. This paper reports initial measurements of forces and torques at the interaction point between tools and mocked up documents. Five conservators used their preferred tools (such as scalpel, needle, brush, and microspatula) to remove material adhered to the samples. We analyzed video and 100 Hz force and torque recordings in the time and frequency domain to gain {{understanding of the nature of}} these tasks. The results can inform design of training simulators for document conservation skills. I...|$|R

No document produced or received by the public authorities may be destroyed without prior authorization from the National Archivist or his delegates. This supervision of the public archives is assigned to the section “Archive supervision, reporting and co-ordination of archive collection and selection” of the State Archives, supervising the central services of the federal administration, and to the archivists of the State Archives repositories in the Provinces, supervising the external services of the federal administrations, the courts and tribunals of the judiciary and the regional and local administrations.The State Archives thus watches over the due <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> archive <b>documents</b> produced and managed by Belgian public authorities.

40|$|Safeguarding the {{cultural}} patrimony {{represents one of}} the objectives {{and one of the most}} important challenges of our time, because only this can ensure the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>documented</b> historical memory <b>of</b> our civilizations. The first level of safeguarding is knowledge, that means, in some ways and in any case, to document. Indeed, documentation constitutes an indispensable support for the protection of {{the cultural}} patrimony. In recent times, the evolution of concepts and the progress of technologies have meant that the cultural and scientific debate should evolve in the examination of which type of documentation is the most suitable. Today, the need to observe city sites by entering their meanders and penetrating their reality with the aim of being able to interpret, understand and appreciate the values of the more recondite intimacies of the places, is increasingly felt. The methodological approach of this study tackles the issue of managing information that is highly interrelated, referring to the entire monumental unicum of Ortigia, by means of recognition of the parts, at times also fragmentary. With this responsibility, a suite of digital instruments, online and offline, called Crabnebula, has been conceived and already applied to a significant portion of Ortigia, with the aim of uniting various useful information towards a critical interpretation of the places: from the integrated environmental, urban and architectonic survey, to the three-dimensional rendered model...|$|R

40|$|One {{principal}} {{goal of the}} Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections (MASC) is {{to ensure}} that archived materials are readily available to researchers. Even fragile materials must be in a stable and functional condition for researchers to effectively utilize them without causing damage. This issue raises concerns about how best to preserve the integrity of rare books, manuscripts, prints, drawings, maps, and photographs while still ensuring adequate research access. This session describes the chief techniques necessary for proper preservation and <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> paper <b>documents.</b> The primary objective <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> treatment is to stabilize an item, prevent further damage and deterioration, and improve the condition of the item for future use by researchers. Through the use <b>of</b> modern <b>conservation</b> techniques, it is possible to repair items to a stable restored condition. A sample of treatments performed include constructing new cases or bindings, reattaching loose or broken boards, sewing pamphlets and textblocks, mending tears, cleaning dirty documents, reattaching loose pages, repairing cracked bindings, removing old or damaging repairs, creating Mylar encapsulations, and constructing acid free custom enclosures. Fundamentally, the goal of repairing items in MASC is to stabilize them as well as allow access for future researchers. Through the continuous application <b>of</b> preservation and <b>conservation</b> treatments to the MASC collections, the archives will continue to maintain the historical originality of items while ensuring their accessibility.

50|$|Against the {{background}} of the ongoing debate on the complete digitization of photo archives and the frequent demands thus being made for the gradual winding up of photo archives and their conversion into digital and internet searchable forms, the Florence Declaration supports the view that, while the digitization of photographic collections is undoubtedly an aim worth pursuing, digital photos can only in part replace the original photographic print. Digital archives cannot therefore entirely take over the task of analogue archives. For technologies not only condition the methods <b>of</b> transmission, <b>conservation</b> and use <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> but also shape their content. An analogue photo and its digital reproduction should therefore be considered two distinct objects. They each have different features. They cannot be interchanged. Since fields of research and topics of investigation in the human and social sciences have greatly changed in recent years, and analogue photography itself has increasingly become a focus of scholarly research, it is essential, according to the Florence Declaration, to overcome the traditional equivalence between analogue photographs and their digital reproduction.|$|R
40|$|Electronically signed {{documents}} {{can lose}} value of evidence because {{the security of}} cryptographic algorithms decreases {{in the course of}} time. In this paper we describe legal, technical and user-oriented requirements for long-term <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> provability <b>of</b> electronically signed <b>documents,</b> which were systematically examined in the project “ArchiSig- Conclusive and secure long term archiving of digitally signed documents”. Existing concepts are presented and evaluated. Subsequently, we present the concept of ArchiSig with its theoretical foundations and its possible applications. 1. Problems and Objectives The integrity and authenticity <b>of</b> electronic <b>documents</b> can be proved with the help of electronic signatures if the underlying cryptographic algorithms are secure. However, hash and public key algorithms can lose their security suitability in the course of time, which can endanger the provability <b>of</b> electronically signed <b>documents</b> after a longer period of time. In many fields <b>of</b> application, <b>documents</b> need to be archived for 30 years or more in a secure and conclusive way. Therefore, the value of evidence of electronic signatures has to be preserved actively before the extinction of security suitability of the employed cryptographic algorithm. In the ArchiSig project, supported by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (VERNET program) under the number 01 MS 121, an interdisciplinary team of representatives from science, industry and users elaborates solutions and concepts for the secure and conclusive long-term archiving <b>of</b> electronically signed <b>documents.</b> Among others, the objective of the ArchiSig project is to work out legal, technical and useroriented requirements for a long-term <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> provability <b>of</b> electronically signed <b>documents,</b> to evaluate existing concepts according to these requirements and to elaborate new concepts that meet these requirements. 2.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> {{manuscripts and}} paper-based objects {{containing}} iron gall ink raises specific problems, {{even when the}} paper is in good condition. Iron gall inks are sensitive to water and some restoration treatments involving water cause small migrations of ink around the line. These brown halos, generally very subtle, are often acceptable. However, they are accompanied by iron migration that can be detrimental for the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> the support. <b>Documents</b> in good condition can be potentially damaged by inappropriate restoration treatments. This problem {{is all the more}} crucial as solubility tests performed by paper conservators are unreliable and do not allow identification of migrating compounds. An alternative tool has recently been proposed for treatment. It aims to test the act of treatment itself, which is applied to a paper impregnated with bathophenathroline and stamped with an iron gall ink. Migrations of Fe(II) out of the ink line are visually assessed through the occurrence of pink halos. This test is particularly sensitive. If no pink halo appears, the treatment process can be implemented with confidence on original objects. As this test ensures a satisfactory procedure when repairing originals, it is tempting to use it more generally for any solventbased treatment. To this end, several treatments were evaluated with this test and the results compared with the examination of original manuscripts subjected to the same treatments. This approachshowed that this test is poorly reliable to evaluate alcoholbased treatments as bathophenantroline and its derivatives are alcohol soluble. Regarding water-based treatments, the test is not suitable for assessing immersion treatments but gave convincing results when evaluating treatments using a moderate addition of water and where there is no possible extraction of soluble components. In particular, it allowed the determination of safe humidity levels to be applied...|$|R
