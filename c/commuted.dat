40|$|This paper revisits {{the notion}} of random <b>commuting</b> within the excess <b>commuting</b> framework. In doing so, it argues that the average random <b>commute,</b> is a more {{appropriate}} basis for measuring the efficiency of urban <b>commuting</b> patterns. Using this as a base, the paper introduces two new measures of <b>commuting</b> efficiency based on measuring the collective <b>commuting</b> economy of individuals for the journey to work: <b>commuting</b> economy and normalised <b>commuting</b> economy. It is argued that because the average random <b>commute</b> has an intrinsically behavioural interpretation, the measures introduced yield more explicit explanations of the overall nature of travel behaviour within the constraints set by land use geography and the spatial distribution of the transport network. The framework is applied for two different years, 1991 and 2001, and for different modes of transport. The {{results show that the}} average actual <b>commute</b> has moved further away from the average random <b>commute,</b> implying that greater intermixing of residential and employment functions has led to more efficient <b>commuting</b> behaviour...|$|R

The ideal <b>commuting</b> times and tolerance thresholds of <b>commuting</b> time of long-duration commuters were also investigated. The statistical results revealed the distributions of ideal <b>commuting</b> times and tolerance thresholds of <b>commuting</b> time of both short- and long-duration commuters. The average tolerance threshold of <b>commuting</b> time and the average ideal <b>commuting</b> time of long-duration commuters were greater than those of short-duration commuters. For 97. 2 % of the long-duration commuters, their actual <b>commuting</b> time was longer than the ideal <b>commuting</b> time; this finding indicates that most long-duration commuters are dissatisfied with their <b>commuting</b> time.

40|$|When people <b>commute</b> to work {{longer or}} {{farther than the}} actual spatial {{arrangement}} of homes and workplaces suggest they could be <b>commuting,</b> people are engaging in excess <b>commuting.</b> In the aggregate, excess <b>commuting</b> is the nonoptimal or surplus work travel occurring in cities because people do not minimize their journeys to work. In this paper an alternative view of excess <b>commuting</b> based on a theoretical maximum <b>commute</b> is presented. The calculation of a theoretical maximum <b>commute</b> allows for {{an analysis of the}} range between the theoretical minimum and maximum <b>commutes,</b> which marks an improvement over current approaches to the measure of excess <b>commuting.</b> Conceptually, this range is taken to be the <b>commuting</b> capacity of a city. To what extent <b>commuting</b> capacity is consumed in terms of current levels of <b>commuting</b> forms a primary question of the analysis. A model is formulated and applied to 1990 Census data for a sample of US cities. Numerical and visual results suggest variation in the amount of excess <b>commuting</b> and consumed <b>commuting</b> potential for the sample of cities. The results also suggest a relationship between the jobs - housing balance of a city (as captured by its theoretical minimum <b>commute)</b> and its observed <b>commute.</b> Additionally, the maximization calculation is shown to provide insight into the degree of decentralized urban form. A conclusion is provided which relates the findings of this research to larger issues of urban sustainability. ...|$|R
