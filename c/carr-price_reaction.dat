40|$|The {{pigmented}} bacteria {{distributed in}} the Kinko bay were Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, Flavobacterium, Micrococcus and Alteromonas spp. Among them, Pseudomonas and Corynebacterium spp. were predominant. Purple bacteria belonged to the genus Alteromonas. As {{the mouth of the}} bay, Pseudomonas was predominant, but at the innermost station Corynebactrium predominated. The pigment in these bacteria, except for strains of Alteromonas was found to be a carotenoid by means of spectrophotometric assessment of absorbance and <b>Carr-Price</b> <b>reaction.</b> One of the pigmented Corynebacterium, C- 2 strain produced carotenoid pigment upon supplementation of a dialyzable constituent of yeast extract to a basal medium. The pigment of Alteromonas strains was violacein. Alteromonas B, C, and D strains produced their purple pigment in a histidine or aspartic acid medium prepared as a sole source of nitrogen. Supplementation of tryptophan inhibited their growth and pigment production...|$|E

Vitamin Ax was {{identified by the}} <b>Carr-Price</b> (antimony chloride) <b>reaction.</b> These experiments provide the first demonstration of vitamin A in the tissues of an insect. Like retinene, vitamin A is confined to the heads and is not found in either thoraces or abdomens. Dark-adapted bees have very little vitamin A. During light adaptation the vitamin A increases, but {{at the expense of}} retinene, which decreases. As much as 0. 1 ~g of vitamin A/gin of heads has been recovered from light-adapted bees. Two methods are described for demonstrating the enzymic reduction of retinene to vitamin A, using an extract of the heads of honeybees. It is generally believed that vitamin A is not required by insects for growth. Furthermore, there is no convincing evidence in the literature that vitamin A exists in the tissues of insects (see Goldsmith, 1964, for further discussion and references). On the other hand, retinenel, the aldehyde of vitamin A 1, has been reported from Hymenoptera (Goldsmith, 1958; Briggs, 1961); Dipter...|$|R
