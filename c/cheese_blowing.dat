40|$|The {{growth of}} Clostridium tyrobutyricum in {{developing}} cheese leads to spoilage and <b>cheese</b> <b>blowing.</b> Bacteriophages or their specific lytic enzymes {{may provide a}} biological control method for eliminating such undesirable organisms without affecting other microflora. We isolated the virulent bacteriophage φCTP 1 belonging to the Siphoviridae and have shown that it is effective in causing lysis of sensitive strains. The double-stranded DNA genome of φCTP 1 is 59, 199 bp, and sequence analysis indicated that it has 86 open reading frames. orf 29 was identified as the gene coding for the phage endolysin responsible for cell wall degradation prior to virion release. We cloned and expressed the ctp 1 l gene in E. coli and demonstrated that the partially purified protein induced lysis of C. tyrobutyricum cells and reduced viable counts both in buffer and in milk. The endolysin was inactive against a range of clostridial species but did show lysis of Clostridium sporogenes, another potential spoilage organism. Removal of the C-terminal portion of the endolysin completely abolished lytic activity...|$|E
40|$|ALTERNATIVES TO CONTROL MICROBIOLOGICAL CHEESE DEFECTS: USE OF AROMATIC PLANTS 1. Introduction Cheeses are {{traditionally}} affected by microbiological spoilage {{that leads to}} great economic loss. On the one hand, bacteria such as coliforms or butyric acid {{are some of the}} responsible for early and late <b>cheese</b> <b>blowing,</b> respectively (COGAN, 2011; GARDE et al., 2011). These are two cheese paste defects characterised by the internal presence of numerous and odorous holes (MCSWEENEY, 2007; MULLAN, 2000). On the other hand, moulds have been described as being the most important cheese production problem (NEAVES and WILLIAMS 2012). They can affect cheese appearance, flavour and texture, and can even be involved in human health problems due to mycotoxins production (BELITZ, 2009). Nowadays, the control methods available are expensive, like bactofugation or ultrafiltration (FOX and COGAN, 2003). Moreover, the use of some substances like nitrate salts or antifungal agents is under extreme controlled or is not always allowed (FDA, 2012). This Thesis aims to provide a natural and alternative way to control these important microbiological cheese defects by using aromatic plants extracts which are well-known for their antimicrobial properties. 2. Research To achieve this objective, it was necessary to assay in vitro a collection of 15 plants in their essential oil (EO) and aqueous extract (AE) forms against microorganisms Escherichia coli, Clostridium tyrobutyricum and Penicillium verrucosum. After this test, the three most active extracts were selected to be added to cheese milk. Prepared cheeses were analysed in terms of volatile composition to determine the transfer of compounds and they were tested against target microorganisms to evaluate their antimicrobial properties. When continuing with the experimental food matrices trials, safranal (the main compound responsible for Crocus sativus L. aroma) was added to milk to produce cheese and ¿requesón¿ (whey cheese) and their transfer through cheesemaking and antimicrobial properties were studied. 3. Conclusions This Thesis found that Thymus vulgaris EO was the most suitable extract for the control of mould growth but also was able to inhibit the clostridial bacteria. Although the great efficacy of Melissa officinalis EO against C. tyrobutyricum it was not adequate for cheese production. This essential oil had a negative effect on lactic acid bacteria, which are necessary for the correct ripening of cheeses. Moreover the whey from cheese fabrication with the addition of safranal, presented good antifungal properties, suggesting even a synergistic effect among the ovine whey compounds and safranal. This Thesis met its main objective: to provide an alternative to control microbiological cheese defects by using aromatic plants. 4. Bibliography BELITZ, H. -D., GROSCH, W. and SCHIRBERLE, P. 2009.

40|$|Hen egg-white {{lysozyme}} (LSZ) {{is currently}} {{used in the}} food industry to limit the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria spoilage {{in the production of}} wine and beer, and to inhibit butyric acid fermentation in hard and extra hard <b>cheeses</b> (late <b>blowing)</b> caused by the outgrowth of clostridial spores. The aim of this work was to evaluate how the enzyme activity in commercial preparations correlates to the enzyme concentration and can be affected by the presence of process-related impurities. Different analytical approaches, including turbidimetric assay, SDS-PAGE and HPLC were used to analyse 17 commercial preparations of LSZ marketed in different countries. The HPLC method adopted by ISO allowed the true LSZ concentration to be determined with accuracy. The turbidimetric assay was the most suitable method to evaluate LSZ activity, whereas SDS-PAGE allowed the presence of other egg proteins, which are potential allergens, to be detected. The analytical results showed that the purity of commercially available enzyme preparations can vary significantly, and evidenced the effectiveness of combining different analytical approaches in this type of control...|$|R
40|$|A {{molecular}} biology method based on {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) and {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) was developed to detect Clostridium spp. in cheese samples suspected of late blowing. Strains of Clostridium spp. and different Lactic Acid Bacteria species, obtained from international collections, were used to determine the experimental conditions for the PCR amplification and DGGE differentiation. DNA extracted directly from <b>cheeses</b> with late <b>blowing</b> symptoms was subjected to PCR and DGGE analysis and traditional agar plating was performed for samples pasteurized and enriched overnight. Moreover, volatile fatty acids were determined for comparison purposes. The PCR-DGGE results were in agreement with the plating performed, and only samples presenting DGGE bands migrating at the same position as Clostridium spp. bands, showed the presence of Clostridium colonies on Reinforced Clostridial Medium plates. Butyric acid contents were high (> 100 mg/kg) in the cases of positive DGGE results, underlining the suitability of the protocol for the study of cheese spoilage. The sensitivity of the method is estimated to be 104 CFU/g...|$|R
40|$|Yeast and Clostridia is {{a problem}} in silage for farmers as {{contaminated}} silage may result in poor animal health and milk quality. Clostridia can produce toxins that, when consumed, acts as neurotoxins, it may also cause <b>blown</b> <b>cheeses</b> if the Clostridia contaminates milk. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the cause, effect and interaction of yeasts and Clostridia in silage. Clostridia are microorganisms which are strictly anaerobic and consume carbohydrates and protein in the silage. Yeast is a fungus that is facultative aerobic and feed on carbohydrates in the silage. The reason that yeast and Clostridia occur in silage is mainly caused by that the pH is not reduced in an anaerobic environment or because an anaerobic environment is not maintained in the silage, due mainly to oxygen ingress and holes in the plastic that provides air access to the silage. Yeast and Clostridia consume carbohydrates and proteins in the silage, which result in losses of nutrients. There is an interaction between yeast and Clostridia although they have completely different ecological niches. The most probable situation is that yeast creates an anaerobic environment for Clostridia when it consumes the oxygen in the silage. Therefore, Clostridia and yeast are usually found on the surface layer of silage where it has been an aerobic environment. There is a need for more studies on how yeast and Clostridia interact in different types of silages...|$|R
40|$|The {{members of}} the genus Clostridium, {{including}} the spore-forming anaerobic bacteria, have a complex and strictly regulated life cycle, but very {{little is known about}} the genetic pathways involved in the different stages of their life cycle. Clostridium sporogenes, a Gram-positive bacterium usually involved in food spoilage and frequently isolated from late <b>blowing</b> <b>cheese,</b> is genetically indistinguishable from the proteolytic Clostridium botulinum. As the non-neurotoxic counterpart, it is often used as an exemplar for the toxic subtypes. In this work, we performed a microscopic study combined with a custom array-based analysis of the C. sporogenes cycle, from dormant spores to the early stationary phase. We identified a total of 211 transcripts in spores, validating the hypothesis that mRNAs are abundant in spores and the pattern of mRNA expression is strikingly different from that present in growing cells. The spore transcripts included genes responsible for different life-sustaining functions, suggesting there was transcript entrapment or basic poly-functional gene activation for future steps. In addition, 3 h after the beginning of the germination process, 20 % of the total up-regulated genes were temporally expressed in germinating spores. The vegetative condition appeared to be more active in terms of gene transcription and protein synthesis than the spore, and genes coding for germination and sporulation factors seemed to be expressed at this point. These results suggest that spores are not silent entities, and a broader knowledge of the genetic pathways involved in the Clostridium life cycle could provide a better understanding of pathogenic clostridia type...|$|R
