50|$|As a village, Pleasant Prairie {{constantly}} {{struggled to}} maintain its identity and ability {{to provide for the}} orderly development of the community. In 1961, the village hall moved from the former Williams Congregational Church site to rented office space in a small commercial center located on 22nd Avenue and 91st Street. In 1967 the village government moved into a newly constructed municipal building on Springbrook Road and 39th Avenue that provided office, an auditorium, Fire Department <b>apparatus</b> <b>room,</b> and sleeping quarters.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel was dug and {{enlarged}} by the Republic of China Armed Forces in 1974 {{to accommodate}} tanks. It took them 10 years to fully finish the work. It was then named Tunnel 88 {{to commemorate the}} 88th birthday of Chiang Kai-shek in 1975, the year he passed away. The tunnel was then later used by Chunghwa Telecom for <b>apparatus</b> <b>room.</b> In 1992, it was handed over to Matsu Winery. Currently the tunnel is used to store jugs of wine.|$|R
5000|$|In {{broadcast}} facilities, {{a central}} <b>apparatus</b> <b>room</b> (CAR, pronounced [...] "C-A-R"), central machine room, or central equipment room (CER), or central technical area (CTA), or rack room is where shared equipment {{common to all}} technical areas is located. Some broadcast facilities have several of these rooms. It should be air-conditioned, however low-noise specifications such as acoustical treatments are optional. Equipment is connected either directly with an attached foldout monitor, keyboard and mouse or remotely via KVM switch, ssh, VNC, or remote desktop.|$|R
500|$|In 1887, {{the state}} of Georgia {{acquired}} [...] of land from Atlanta pioneer Richard Peters that would form the original campus of what was then called the Georgia School of Technology, {{as well as the}} site of its first two structures. The state hired the well-known architectural firm Bruce & Morgan to design an Academic Building, containing [...] "ample accommodations in halls, offices, <b>apparatus</b> <b>rooms,</b> recitation and lecture rooms, free hand and mechanical drawing rooms, library and chapel," [...] as well as a Shop Building, in which [...] "boiler and engine rooms, wood shop, machine shop, forge room and foundry" [...] were located.|$|R

50|$|In 1914 {{they agreed}} to {{continue}} the arrangement and to rent for a further £3 annually the adjoining large room, previously occupied by an auctioneer, and formerly being the coastguards' rocket <b>apparatus</b> <b>room.</b> In agreeing to the expansion, the Leeds University Finance Committee suggested that any funds required for additional equipment should be raised by private subscription. Walter Garstang was confident that he could acquire the necessary funds. Martha Storm {{had been willing to}} sell the premises in 1914, {{but it was not until}} 1922 that the buildings were jointly purchased by Leeds and Sheffield for the sum of £220. There were very few permanent facilities at the laboratory, so when the classes travelled over from Leeds and Sheffield they had to bring all the equipment they needed with them and carry it down from the top of Bay Bank.|$|R
2500|$|By 1910, the Fire Brigade {{was finding}} it {{necessary}} to expand and decided that the No 1 Fire Station {{would have to be}} extended in order to accommodate extra plant, extra workshop accommodation, a boardroom and officers' quarters. The block adjacent to the station in Irwin Street was purchased from the Roman Catholic Church and the Board at a cost of ₤2,100 pounds. This block of land had a school building on it, so the building committee recommended that the Fire Brigade staff (many of whom were skilled tradesmen) [...] "...undertake the building of the workshops and lecture room with the old material available in the School". James (Jack) Learmonth Ochiltree was appointed as the architect for the additions. (Ochiltree's firm, Ochiltree & Hargrave, went on to design a number of Inter-War Art Deco buildings in Perth.) [...] The additions to the building consisted of a new boardroom, offices, <b>apparatus</b> <b>room,</b> ambulance shed, store and chief officers' quarters, and was completed in 1914.|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} that arises is {{how does a}} contractor estimate productivity for a project subjected to adverse climatic conditions and how do these efficiencies impact on schedule and cost estimates. Additionally, what alternatives are available to the contractor in completing a project subject to adverse climatic conditions. It is therefore the intent of this report to demonstrate one method of estimating productivity efficiencies and to demonstrate their impact on construction scheduling and cost. Additionally, it is intended to investigate alternatives available to the contractor. In order to demonstrate the impact of adverse climatic conditions on project schedule and cost, and actual construction contract was selected is a two story building of approximately 4800 square feet for fire station use including an <b>apparatus</b> <b>room,</b> a dormitory area, a living/dining area, alarm room, reception room, and administrative spaces.
