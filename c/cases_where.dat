5|$|Peter Cane has {{distinguished}} between <b>cases</b> <b>where</b> {{the courts have}} found that an applicant has standing to represent identifiable individuals (associational standing), and <b>cases</b> <b>where</b> the applicant purports to represent the public interest (public interest standing). Under this analysis, ex parte Greenpeace may be regarded {{as an example of}} the former, and ex parte World Development Movement the latter. In 1994, the Law Commission recommended that there should be a two-track system for standing. An applicant should have standing in one of two situations: either in his or her personal capacity, in which case a remedy lies ex debito justitae ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right); or at the discretion of the court if it considers that it is in the public interest to accord standing.|$|E
