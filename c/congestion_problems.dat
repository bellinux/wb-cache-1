An {{important part of the}} government's growth strategy for the town is new road infrastructure consisting of a new link road (Taunton's Third Way) which was completed 27 September 2011 at a cost of £7.5 million. A second link road, (the Northern Inner Distributor Road) planned for completion by the end of 2014 at a cost of £21 million, is still unfinished in 2016, with no completion in the near future. The road would link Staplegrove Road with Priory Avenue, running across Station Road.|$|E

He issued a pamphlet, A twenty minutes letter to the citizens of London, in favour of the Metropolitan Railway and City Station, encouraging investment and he even persuaded the City of London to invest on the basis that the railway would alleviate the City's <b>congestion</b> <b>problems.</b> Once the railway was in operation, the City sold its shares at a profit. By 1860, the funds had been collected and the final route decided.

5|$|The Panama Canal had {{a limited}} {{capacity}} determined by operational times and cycles {{of the existing}} locks and further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal which take more transit time within the locks and navigational channels, {{and the need for}} permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal, which forces periodical shutdowns of this waterway. On the other hand, demand has been growing due to the rapid growth of international trade. Also, many users require a guarantee of certain level of service. Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the <b>congestion</b> <b>problems</b> was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of locks. Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter commercial operation in June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the current locks are capable of handling.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} <b>problem</b> of <b>congestion</b> and quality loss of data {{transmission}} through the Internet {{from an economic}} perspective. We show that due to the <b>congestion</b> <b>problem,</b> quality sensitive services {{are likely to be}} crowded out by high volume but less quality sensitive applications in a strict "neutral" system. This crowding out reduces the availability of services and the development and diffusion of innovative and high value services. Not least, the <b>congestion</b> <b>problem</b> causes welfare loss. As we discuss in this paper, the differentiation of data packets according to their quality sensitivity could remedy the <b>congestion</b> <b>problem.</b> Appropriate business models that incorporate quality of service concepts could be very efficient in preventing the crowding out of high value quality sensitive services without affecting other applications and would be very convenient for Internet users at the same time. We show that any ex ante regulation in the sense of strict Net neutrality could seriously harm the development of innovative business models and discourage innovation and investment.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of {{population}} in Hong Kong, the government has been formulating different policies including housing, social and transport services to cope with the situation. Undoubtedly one of the major concerns arising from increase of population is road traffic <b>congestion</b> <b>problem.</b> If no appropriate measures are to be taken, the effect would be very detrimental, which not only affect the general public living but also the whole economy of Hong Kong. As such, the <b>congestion</b> <b>problem</b> has been seriously addressed by the government since the early era with numbers of traffic-related policies formulated which aims at alleviating the <b>congestion</b> <b>problem</b> in the whole territory in Hong Kong. Over the past decades, transport services have been expanded in many aspects so as to cope with the ever-increasing population demand as well as to relieve the congested situation. Relieving traffic congestion measures has always been a heated topic in the policy agenda in the government, as well as within the society. Over the past years, the HKSAR had been drawing a number of traffic-related policies to solve the congested problem especially at those black spots. Also while working closely with different public transport stakeholders, more diversified regulations or traffic management measures have also been launched. In this dissertation, the traffic <b>congestion</b> <b>problem</b> and the traffic congestion management measures are the main subjects for discussion. On examining the effectiveness of the policies concerned, a Tool-kit approach will be adopted. Each policy will be addressed under the five policy tools which are used as the basics for reviewing the traffic policies and traffic management measures formulated by the government from the previous decades till the current stage. The 5 chosen Policy Tools are Direct Government; Economic and Social Regulation; Corrective Taxes; Contracting; and Information. The effectiveness of those measures will be further evaluated based on the five criteria: Effectiveness; Efficiency; Equity; Manageability; and Political Legitimacy. Over the past decades, transport services have been expanded in many aspects so as to cope with the ever-increasing population demand as well as to relieve the congested situation. The measures appear to be effective, but there seems to be room for further improvement. Apart from the relieving measures to be discussed, there are still numbers of alternative proposals that can help to alleviate the <b>congestion</b> <b>problem</b> in Hong Kong. One is the adoption of the Electronic Road Pricing System and the other alternatives include better utilization of the RHCs and control the numbers of vehicles on roads. While most of the relieving measures carried out in the past are considered to be effective, that would not be enough as in view of the increasing population, It’s time for the government to take into account other alternatives that are considered to be effective options in solving the <b>congestion</b> <b>problem.</b> While adopting or implementing any of the proposed option requires considerable preparation works and timing, the government should take an active and swift approach without delay. published_or_final_versionPolitics and Public AdministrationMasterMaster of Public Administratio...|$|R
