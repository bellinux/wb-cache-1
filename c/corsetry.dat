5|$|Whitby grew in {{size and}} wealth, {{extending}} its activities to include shipbuilding using local oak timber. In 1790–91 Whitby built 11,754tons of shipping, making it the third largest shipbuilder in England, after London and Newcastle. Taxes on imports entering the port raised money to improve and extend the town's twin piers, improving the harbour and permitting further increases in trade. In 1753 the first whaling ship set sail to Greenland and by 1795 Whitby had become a major whaling port. The most successful year was 1814 when eight ships caught 172 whales, and the whaler, the Resolutions catch produced 230tons of oil. The carcases yielded 42tons of whale bone used for 'stays' which {{were used in the}} <b>corsetry</b> trade until changes in fashion made them redundant. Blubber was boiled to produce oil for use in lamps in four oil houses on the harbourside. Oil was used for street lighting until the spread of gas lighting reduced demand and the Whitby Whale Oil and Gas Company changed into the Whitby Coal and Gas Company. As the market for whale products fell, catches became too small to be economic and by 1831 only one whaling ship, the Phoenix, remained.|$|E
25|$|The word corset {{is derived}} from the Old French word corps and the {{diminutive}} of body, which itself derives from —Latin for body. The craft of corset construction is known as <b>corsetry,</b> as is the general wearing of them. (The word <b>corsetry</b> is sometimes also used as a collective plural form of corset.) Someone who makes corsets is a corsetier or corsetière (French terms for a man and for a woman maker, respectively), or sometimes simply a corsetmaker.|$|E
25|$|Elaborate {{constraints}} {{placed on}} women's figures {{over the years}} were not universal. <b>Corsetry</b> made it virtually impossible to work, so simpler functional garments were worn by women who worked inside or outside the home. Support for the breasts was often provided by a simple tie under the breast line, in the bodice.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of the bra from the corset was driven by two parallel movements: health professionals' concerns about the cruel, constraining effects of the corset, and the clothing reform movement of feminists who saw that greater participation of women in society would require emancipation from <b>corsetry.</b> Prominent amongst these were the Rational Dress Society, the National Dress Reform Association, and the Reform Dress Association.|$|E
500|$|It is {{now widely}} {{believed}} that authentic metal corsets were {{intended as a}} form of orthopaedic brace to address spinal issues such as scoliosis. The 16th-century French army surgeon Ambroise Paré described metal corsets as intended [...] "to amend the crookednesse of the Bodie," [...] recommending that the iron should be perforated {{in order to make the}} garments lighter, and that they be made to fit and padded for comfort. Paré criticised the concept of <b>corsetry</b> as a waist-training device, warning that such a practice risked deforming the figure.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{negotiations}} started, something unexpected happened. In 1992, the plunge style became {{a hit with}} British women and sales took off. Between 1991 and 1993, UK sales of that Wonderbra style quadrupled to $28 million, accounting for 12.5% of the $225 million UK branded bra market. Several factors might have contributed to this boom including [...] "an article in British Vogue on {{the return of the}} padded bra, a Vivienne Westwood-inspired fad for <b>corsetry</b> and that Gaultier driven yearning for underwear as outerwear". With this surge in sales, Sara Lee decided not to renew the license with Gossard.|$|E
500|$|In 1933, {{the first}} foreign branch {{was set up}} in Bad Zurzach (Switzerland). With the {{division}} of Germany in 1949, the Triumph International brand continued in the German Democratic Republic, but business activities there came to a virtual standstill. However, the internationalization of the company continued in the following period and beginning in the 1950s, offices were opened in Belgium, Great Britain, Sweden, Norway and Austria. Triumph International further expanded in 1960 by establishing its Asia-Pacific region headquarters in Hong Kong, and opening its first Japanese branch in 1963. At the time, observers already described it as a [...] "cunning web" [...] of companies, some of which were registered in the tax havens of Liechtenstein and Bermuda. In the late 1960s, Triumph International's market share for <b>corsetry</b> in Germany was about 50 percent.|$|E
500|$|In the ska tune [...] "The Arse End Of The Earth", {{which refers}} to Keating's private {{description}} of Australia, both Keating and Evans complain about the day-to-day issues {{of the economy and}} their unfavourable portrayal in the commercial media {{getting in the way of}} their larger agenda, including republicanism, a new flag, and Aboriginal reconciliation. [...] Alexander Downer replaces Hewson as Opposition Leader for a short and unsuccessful period. [...] In a costume of fishnets, <b>corsetry</b> and lipstick that alludes to a photograph of the actual Downer posing in fishnet stockings for a competition, he sings his belief that he is just [...] "too freaky" [...] for the leadership ("Freaky"). [...] Meanwhile, Evans has an extramarital affair with Australian Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot (typically played by a male) ("Heavens, Mister Evans"). [...] In an understated minor-key bossa nova song, Keating sings of the need to recognise and apologise for the damage done by white colonisation and subsequent subjugation of the Australian Aboriginal population ("Redfern"), before segueing into a more upbeat mambo about the Mabo decision by the High Court of Australia and his attempts to use the decision to promote a reconciliation agenda ("Ma(m)bo").|$|E
2500|$|Some {{physicians}} ignored {{colleagues who}} felt corsets were a medical necessity because of women's biology {{and the needs}} of civilized order. The physicians who raised the alarm pointed to nausea, bowel disturbances, eating disorders, breathlessness, flushing, fainting, and gynecological problems. Bed rest was a common prescription for the [...] "weaker sex," [...] which of course implied relief from <b>corsetry.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Fashion in the 1880s in Western and Western-influenced {{countries}} {{is characterized by}} the return of the bustle. [...] The long, lean line of the 1870s was replaced by a full, curvy silhouette with gradually widening shoulders. [...] Fashionable waists were low and tiny below a full, low bust supported by a corset. [...] The Rational Dress Society was founded in 1881 in reaction to the extremes of fashionable <b>corsetry.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there were}} a number of voices warning about the {{considerable}} health risks of corsets, health professions were generally muted, and women ignored [...] "unfashionable" [...] advice. The health professions concentrated more on psychosomatic complaints, which were in fact probably related to <b>corsetry.</b> Ill health was considered synonymous with femininity, and a pale and sickly demeanor was normative. (Fictional heroines often died from tuberculosis, or [...] "consumption." [...] This made them pale and kept them immobile.) Corsets were supposed to provide both physical and moral support.|$|E
2500|$|By this time, such {{movements}} as the Rational Dress Society (1881), {{with which the}} Morrises and Georgiana Burne-Jones were involved, were beginning to exercise some influence on women's dress, although the pre-Raphaelite look was still considered [...] "advanced" [...] in the late years of the 19th century. Queen Victoria's precocious daughter Princess Louise, an accomplished painter and artist who mixed in bohemian circles, was sympathetic to rational dress and to the developing women's movement generally (although her rumoured pregnancy {{at the age of}} 18 was said to have been disguised by tight <b>corsetry).</b>|$|E
2500|$|With the corset all but extinct by the mid-1930s, the company’s new {{leadership}} focused on developing new products. [...] In 1937, {{the company that}} revolutionized <b>corsetry</b> revolutionized the brassiere by assigning letters to various cup sizes. The ABC Alphabet Bra {{set the standard for}} bra sizing that is still used today. By the early 1940s, the company was profitable again, bringing in $1 million by 1947. Sales of bras, girdles, and the cross-promotion of the Merry Widow line of corselets with the 1952 Lana Turner movie of the same name, led to record profits.|$|E
2500|$|Von Teese has {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} best-dressed lists and frequents the front row of fashion shows, particularly Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Marc Jacobs, labels she is often seen wearing. Speaking of her love of Gaultier, Von Teese has said, [...] "Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood were the first designers that really made an impact on me. Jean Paul has {{a lot of the same}} obsessions that I do, like <b>corsetry,</b> ballet-peach satin and silks, black silk velvet, bullet bras and girdles. When I was a teenager, I would look for 1930s peach satin lingerie pieces to try to get his look for less, because there was no way I could afford his things back then. It was a dream come true to meet him and become friends with him. I met him the first time when I was doing my first fashion pictorial, which was for Flaunt magazine, and it was a huge story of me wearing the most important pieces from his haute couture archives, and that was a dream!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Andrews wear {{different}} dress, {{but both}} are more equal in their informality than many observers have thought. Robert is as informal {{as a man}} in his position was likely to be seen, even on his own estate, in a loose hunting coat with dangling bags for gunpowder and shot. Frances wears an outfit which in fact is an informal summer suit (as we would now call it) with a separate skirt and jacket, not a dress, of a light blue similar to those that Gainsborough often gave his early female sitters, including her mother, and which may not represent any actual garment of that colour. She wears informal mules and a straw hat. However, their poses are certainly different, with Robert's nonchalant pose not matched by Frances, who is [...] "sitting bolt upright". Apart from considerations of <b>corsetry,</b> and the poise expected of ladies, her figure was probably painted from a dressed artist's mannequin. The rococo bench on which she sits must be made of wood at this date, and it is thought that this was an invention of Gainsborough's, drawing on his period with Gravelot.|$|E
