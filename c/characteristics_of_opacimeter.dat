Several diesel fuel blends, which contain 10 % and 15 % by volume of DPE and DIGLYME, were prepared and the effect of these blends on emission characteristics were studied on a twin cylinder direct injection diesel engine. The blends were tested under the different load conditions and the results shows, there is significant reduction of engine emissions of hydrocarbon and carbon mono oxide emissions while the coefficient of light absorption <b>of</b> smoke <b>opacimeter</b> decreases by about 50 % for DPE 10, DIGLYME 10 blend and it was reduced by about 60 %for DPE 15 and DIGLYME 15 blend...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Electromagnetic {{crystals}} (EC) and EC-inhomogeneities {{are one of}} {{the main}} directions of microstrip devices development. In the article the input impedance <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> EC- and traditional microstrip inhomogeneities and filter based on EC-inhomogeneities are investigated. Transmission coefficient characteristics. Transmission coefficient <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> low impedance EC- and traditional inhomogeneities are considered. Characteristics are calculated in the software package Microwave Studio. It is shown that the efficiency of EC-inhomogeneity is much higher. Input impedance <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> low impedance inhomogeneities. Dependences of input impedance active and reactive parts of EC- and traditional inhomogeneities are given. Dependences of the active part illustrate significant low impedance transformation of nominal impedance. The conditions of impedance matching of structure and input medium are set. Input impedance <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> high impedance inhomogeneities. Input impedance <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> high impedance EC- and traditional inhomogeneities are considered. It was shown that the band of transformation by high impedance inhomogeneities is much narrower than one by low impedance inhomogeneities. <b>Characteristics</b> <b>of</b> the reflection coefficient of inhomogeneities are presented. Input impedance <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> narrowband filter. The structure of narrowband filter based on the scheme of Fabry-Perot resonator is presented. The structure of the filter is fulfilled by high impedance EC-inhomogeneities as a reflectors. Experimental and theoretical amplitude-frequency <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> the filter are presented. Input impedance <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> the filter are shown. Conclusions. Input impedance <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> the structure allow to analyse its wave properties, especially resonant. EC-inhomogeneity compared with traditional microstrip provide substantially more significant transformation of the the input impedance. ? ?????? ??????????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????????? ??????????????????????????????
