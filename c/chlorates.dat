25|$|Some {{grades of}} {{titanium}} based pigments {{as used in}} sparkly paints, plastics, finishes and pearlescent cosmetics are man-made pigments whose particles have two or more layers of various oxides – often titanium dioxide, iron oxide or alumina – {{in order to have}} glittering, iridescent and or pearlescent effects similar to crushed mica or guanine-based products. In addition to these effects a limited colour change is possible in certain formulations depending on how and at which angle the finished product is illuminated and the thickness of the oxide layer in the pigment particle; one or more colours appear by reflection while the other tones appear due to interference of the transparent titanium dioxide layers. In some products, the layer of titanium dioxide is grown in conjunction with iron oxide by calcination of titanium salts (sulfates, <b>chlorates)</b> around 800°C or other industrial deposition methods such as chemical vapour deposition on substrates such as mica platelets or even silicon dioxide crystal platelets of no more than 50µm in diameter.|$|E

40|$|Microbial <b>chlorate</b> {{respiration}} {{plays an}} important role in the turnover of oxochlorates in nature and industrial waste management. This thesis deals with the characterization of the molecular components of <b>chlorate</b> respiration in Ideonella dechloratans. <b>Chlorate</b> respiration utilizes two soluble periplasmic enzymes, <b>chlorate</b> reductase and chlorite dismutase, to convert <b>chlorate</b> to chloride and oxygen. The genes encoding the enzymes participating in the <b>chlorate</b> degradation have been sequenced, and are found in close proximity, forming a gene cluster for <b>chlorate</b> metabolism. This work also includes the successful recombinant expression of three genes from Ideonella dechloratans. Two of the gene products, chlorite dismutase and the C subunit of <b>chlorate</b> reductase, participate in the <b>chlorate</b> respiration. The third gene, which is found close to the gene cluster for <b>chlorate</b> metabolism, encodes a soluble c-type cytochrome. The localization of the gene suggests the corresponding protein as a candidate for a role as electron donor to <b>chlorate</b> reductase. Also, the role of soluble periplasmic c cytochromes of Ideonella dechloratans in <b>chlorate</b> respiration was studied. At least one of the soluble c cytochromes was found capable of serving as electron donor for <b>chlorate</b> reduction. This c cytochrome, and several others, can also donate electrons to a terminal oxidase for subsequent reduction of oxygen, as required for the branched electron flow during <b>chlorate</b> respiration...|$|R

40|$|Several {{bacterial}} {{species are}} capable to use perchlorate and/or <b>chlorate</b> {{as an alternative}} electron acceptor in absence of oxygen. Microbial respiration of oxochlorates is important for biotreatment of effluent from industries where oxochlorates are produced or handled.

Two soluble enzymes, <b>chlorate</b> reductase and chlorite dismutase, participate in the conversion of <b>chlorate</b> into chloride and molecular oxygen. The present study deals with the electron transport from the membrane-bound components to the periplasmic <b>chlorate</b> reductase.

40|$|Incubation {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine the effects of activated sludge on degradation of <b>chlorate</b> in soils. The results show that application of activated sludge could significantly promote the decomposition of soil <b>chlorate</b> though the degradation rate of <b>chlorate</b> did not necessarily increase with increasing application rate of the sludge. The effectiveness of activated sludge on soil <b>chlorate</b> degradation was significantly affected by temperature, moisture content and pH. There is a tendency that the rate of <b>chlorate</b> decomposition increased with increasing temperature and moisture content until optimal values of temperature and moisture content were reached. This can be attributed to the enhanced activity of chlorate-reducing microorganisms in hot and more reducing soil conditions. Soil pH also had important controls on the decomposition of <b>chlorate.</b> The experimental results demonstrate that neutral pH more favoured the degradation of soil <b>chlorate,</b> compared to either acidic or alkaline pH. While soil organic matter content could affect <b>chlorate</b> decomposition, its impact on the effectiveness of activated sludge on <b>chlorate</b> degradation was minor.

40|$|Some {{bacteria}} can use (per) <b>chlorate</b> as terminal electron acceptor for growth. These bacteria convert perchlorate via <b>chlorate</b> and chlorite into chloride and molecular oxygen. Oxygen formation in microbial respiration is unique. In this study two chlorate-reducing strains {{belonging to the}} species Pseudomonas chloritidismutans and a (per) <b>chlorate</b> -reducing strain Dechloromonas hortensis were isolated. The characterization of the chlorate-reducing strain AW- 1, which was isolated from a bioreactor treating a <b>chlorate</b> and bromate polluted waste stream, enabled the comparison of denitrifying bacteria with (per) chlorate-reducing bacteria. Despite a very close phylogenetic relationship between strain AW- 1 and two Pseudomonas stutzeri strains, the former {{was not able to}} use nitrate as electron acceptor, and the latter two were not able to use <b>chlorate.</b> These results confirmed that separate pathways exist for <b>chlorate</b> and nitrate reduction. In accordance, chlorite dismutase activity was only present in strain AW- 1 and it was therefore proposed to name strain AW- 1, Pseudomonas chloritidismutans sp. nov [...] P. chloritidismutans was differentiated from other described (per) <b>chlorate</b> -reducing bacteria, by its inability to use perchlorate. To get more insight into the pathway of <b>chlorate</b> reduction, the <b>chlorate</b> reductase of P. chloritidismutans was purified and characterized. The oxygen sensitive <b>chlorate</b> reductase showed only reductase activity with <b>chlorate</b> and bromate which was different from the purified (per) <b>chlorate</b> reductase of the (per) chlorate-reducing strain GR- 1, which in addition showed activity with perchlorate, nitrate and Mn(V). The <b>chlorate</b> reductase of Ideonella dechloratans also showed no reductase activity with perchlorate. The cytoplasmic localization of the <b>chlorate</b> reductase of P. chloritidismutans was different from the periplasmic orientation of the (per) <b>chlorate</b> reductase of strain GR- 1 and of the <b>chlorate</b> reductase of I. dechloratans. The native enzyme had a molecular mass of 167 kDa and consisted of 3 subunits of 97, 38 and 34 kDa. The same stoichiometry (α 1 β 1 γ 1) was found for the <b>chlorate</b> reductase of I. dechloratans but this was different from the stoichiometry found for the (per) <b>chlorate</b> reductase of strain GR- 1 (α 3 β 3). The b -subunit of the <b>chlorate</b> reductase of P. chloritidismutans revealed sequence similarity to b-subunits of various other reductases or dehydrogenases. The <b>chlorate</b> reductase from P. chloritidismutans was found to contain Mo and Fe, as was the case for the reductase of strain GR- 1. EPR analysis confirmed this. The presence of molybdenum is not unusual because sofar, all enzymes that show <b>chlorate</b> reductase activity contain molybdenum (<b>chlorate</b> reductase of P. chloritidismutans and I. dechloratans, (per) <b>chlorate</b> reductase of strain GR- 1, nitrate reductase, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) reductase). These enzymes are positioned in the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase family. The chlorite dismutase was purified from P. chloritidismutans and this enzyme showed similar characteristics when compared to chlorite dismutases of strain GR- 1, Dechloromonas agitata and I. dechloratans. The localization (periplasm), subunit composition (homotetramer), subunit size and the spectral characteristics (heme group, Fe-protoporphyrin IX) were the same. Experiments with 18 O-labelled water showed that no 36 O 2 or 34 O 2 labeled oxygen was produced, indicating that water is not a substrate in the conversion of chlorite and that oxygen is entirely produced out of chlorite. The N-terminal sequence of the chlorite dismutase of P. chloritidismutans had no similarity with the N-terminal sequences of other chlorite dismutases. Instead, similarity was found with an internal sequence of a hypothetical protein of dechloratans The gene coding for this hypothetical protein (partial ORF 2) was located downstream of the gene of the chlorite dismutase. PCR experiments showed that the chlorite dismutase gene arrangement of P. chloritidismutans was different from the organization of the chlorite dismutase gene and partial ORF 2 which was found for dechloratansThe previously isolated strain GR- 1 had not yet been taxonomically described. Therefore, 16 S rDNA sequence analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization experiments were performed.
