5|$|Mirror {{symmetry}} {{was originally}} discovered by physicists. Mathematicians {{became interested in}} this relationship around 1990 when Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as a tool in enumerative geometry, a branch of mathematics concerned with {{counting the number of}} solutions to geometric questions. Candelas and his collaborators showed that mirror symmetry <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to count rational curves on a Calabi–Yau manifold, thus solving a longstanding problem. Although the original approach to mirror symmetry was based on physical ideas that were not understood in a mathematically precise way, some of its mathematical predictions have since been proven rigorously.|$|E

All analyzed genotypes have specific protein pattern. Some of protein fraction appeared for each genotype at the same position and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>use</b> as reference bands.

5|$|According to Tough, it is {{unlikely}} that the avoidance of immediate dangers and prevention of future catastrophes would be conducted through radio, as these tasks would demand constant surveillance and quick action.
