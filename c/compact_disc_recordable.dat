40|$|In {{this article}} I explore the ‘unofficial’ (and {{technically}} illegal) compiling of marginally known 1960 s pop records on <b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>Recordable</b> (CD-R). I {{do so by}} situating it within the proposition by the late Raphael Samuel, that history is ‘social knowledge’ and a practice rather than a profession. I propose that this compiling activity exemplifies this proposition. The core of the paper is centred on a 2007 survey which I conducted via three on-line 1960 s music enthusiast discussion forums. I draw on the sixteen responses to demonstrate how the motivations, values and intentions of those respondents engaging {{in the practice of}} CD-R compiling are historically and socially centred. In doing so, I seek to problematise the music industry’s undifferentiated condemnation of all copying as theft. I do so by showing how, far from stealing, these CD-R compilers are adding to the musical social knowledge of 1960 s pop and rock music. I further situate them within a longer lineage of ‘unofficial listening’ dating back to at least the 1930 s. In using the term ‘unofficial’ in both a legal and public historical sense (eg to take issue with a received narrative), I point to wider definitions of what historically has or has not been musically ‘official’ to listen to. I seek also to point to the practice of CD-R compiling as a historical ‘moment’ in technological change, which might otherwise go unremarked upon as the CD-R itself heads towards utilitarian obsolescence. Although, the issues and concepts raised in the paper can be little more than pointed to, it is hoped it might act as one platform for the historical engagement with a subject more commonly discussed in sociological terms. As public historians we should be reflexive and inter-disciplinary and it is with this mind set that this article is written...|$|E
40|$|We {{are now in}} a {{rapid growth}} digital age. Different kinds of {{digitized}} applications are affecting people's daily life in different ways. All of these digitized applications generate tremendous amounts of information every day. We need to archive the important information because of their enduring value. However, the storage of digital information over time is a complex and difficult task. Selecting reliable digital archiving media, choosing suitable digital archiving methods, and using appropriate file formats for digital archiving are essential elements for achieving this task. Many companies and organizations have invested in finding reliable and affordable storage media for digital archiving {{since the end of the}} last century. <b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>Recordable</b> (CD-R) quickly became one of the most popular choices for preserving digital information because CD-R can provide reliable back up at a reasonable price. Nevertheless, recent studies revealed that CD-R as a recording media for long term information archiving is not as reliable as we wish [4]. Its recording media may suffer from lost data because of possible damage from heat, humidity and light. In order to improve the performance of CD-R for long term digital archiving, there has been some research on hardware and software solutions to address this potential problem. Still most existing improvements have limitations either in the need of changing current CD-R standards or significant changes in current optical media drives. The objective of this research is to design and implement a novel system that advances the state of the art in digital archiving using CD-R, especially in the area of digital image storage. The design proposes robust image storage methods for CD-Rs based on the JPEG 2000 standard. These storage methods combine the virtual block interleaver, Reed Solomon codes, and the error resilience tools of JPEG 2000 effectively to protect the images on CD-Rs against errors caused by possible physical damage. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed digital data storage methods, numerous experiments are conducted. The results show that the robust digital archiving methods for CD-R are useful and efficient...|$|E

40|$|Executive summary Ever {{since their}} {{appearance}} {{on the market in}} the early 1990 s, <b>recordable</b> <b>compacts</b> <b>discs</b> (CD-Rs), later <b>recordable</b> DVDs and now <b>recordable</b> blue laser <b>discs</b> formats have been used as storage media not only for private purposes, but also for the storage of digitised or born-digital documents in archives and libraries. The attraction to employ these recording media lies in their easy availability and, most importantly, in the low prices of media and recording/replay equipment. The use of CD and DVD <b>recordable</b> <b>discs</b> in archives and libraries has soon raised concerns as to their reliability as storage media. Most of these concerns have focussed on the issue of life expectancy of the media themselves, concluding that different types of dyes, recording substrates, and reflective layers behave differently. The problem, however, is more complex. The quality of the recorded digital signal is an important factor of life expectancy. This quality, however, relies on the interaction of the individual burner, the medium, and the individual player. As burners and players are not standardised, the data quality and life expectancy is to some exten...|$|R
