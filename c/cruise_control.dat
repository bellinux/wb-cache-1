40|$|This study {{applied a}} model {{predictive}} control (MPC) framework {{to solve the}} <b>cruising</b> <b>control</b> problem of a series hydraulic hybrid vehicle (SHHV). The controller not only regulates vehicle velocity, but also engine torque, engine speed, and accumulator pressure to their corresponding reference values. At each time step, a quadratic programming problem is solved within a predictive horizon to obtain the optimal control inputs. The objective is to minimize the output error. This approach ensures that the components operate at high efficiency thereby improving the total efficiency of the system. The proposed SHHV control system was evaluated under urban and highway driving conditions. By handling constraints and input-output interactions, the MPC-based control system ensures that the system operates safely and efficiently. The fuel economy of the proposed control scheme shows a noticeable improvement {{in comparison with the}} PID-based system, in which three Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers are used for <b>cruising</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

50|$|The main safety failing {{with the}} basic dead man’s system is the {{possibility}} of the operating device being held permanently in position, either deliberately or accidentally. Vigilance control was developed to detect this condition by requiring that the dead man’s device be released momentarily and re-applied at timed intervals. There has also been a proposal to introduce a similar system to automotive <b>cruise</b> <b>controls.</b> A hybrid between a dead man's switch and a vigilance control device is a dead-man's vigilance device.|$|R

5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar <b>cruise</b> <b>control,</b> electric variable gear ratio power steering, and electronically controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E

5|$|Released in September 2009, the E Series 2 HSV GTS {{incorporated}} {{a more powerful}} motor and drivetrain than other HSV models. It retains the same GM LS3 6.2L V8 engine but {{while the rest of}} the HSV range still have 317kW or 425bhp, the GTS engine is rated at (325kW). Twin bonnet scoops have returned to this model from the styling of the Pontiac G8. Other changes include the availability of launch control on manual versions, a recalibrated version of the magnetic ride control suspension with stiffer springs for the HSV GTS, wider wheels and a new high-flow dual-mode muffler system that produces a throatier roar under heavy acceleration. The E-Series 2 stability control system also has a Competition setting which allows for more wheel slip for special track or motorsport applications.

40|$|Vehicle {{simulators}} {{are becoming}} more common in vehicle industries. Company earns {{lot of money on}} simulations instead of real tests. Real tests are necessary but not made so extensively as before. In this thesis the building of an vehice simulator will be described and a comparison between three different <b>cruise</b> <b>controls.</b> The three <b>cruise</b> <b>controls</b> are PI-regulator, a regulator who regulates after positions in the terrain and a MPC-regulator. The reason for choosing this three is to see the difference between simple regulation and more complex regulation with respect to fuel consumption, travel time and complexity. The vehicle simulator is made in Matlab/Simulink, Visual Studio and Open Scene Graph. The facilities needed for runnning the simulator is a relative good computer with a grapics card on at least 128 MB RAM plus a steering wheel and pedals for brake and gas to achieve best feeling. A keyboard can be used but it reduces almost all feeling. After several simulations a conclusion was made. The MPC-regulator was the regulator who consumed least fuel and travel time. The regulator who regulates after positions in the terrain was not too far away. It would be interesting to do more research about it. In fact it is only a PI-regulator who makes ``clever'' decisions when a hill with enough slope appears. With enough slope means a downhill where the vehicle can accelerate without the use of fuel and an uphill where the vehicle can not keep its speed with maximum use of fuel. A conclusion was stated that the friction and height profile influenced on settings for the PI-regulator and with some adjustments on this settings, fuel could be saved...|$|R

40|$|Disruptions in airline {{operations}} {{can result}} in infeasibilities in aircraft and passenger schedules. Airlines typically recover aircraft schedules and disruptions in passenger itineraries sequentially. However, passengers are severely affected by disruptions and recovery decisions. In this paper, we present a mathematical formulation for the integrated aircraft and passenger recovery problem that considers aircraft and passenger related costs simultaneously. Using the superimposition of aircraft and passenger itinerary networks, passengers are explicitly modeled {{in order to use}} realistic passenger related costs. In addition to the common routing recovery actions, we integrate several passenger recovery actions and <b>cruise</b> speed <b>control</b> in our solution approach. <b>Cruise</b> speed <b>control</b> is a very beneficial action for mitigating delays. On the other hand, it adds complexity to the problem due to the nonlinearity in fuel cost function. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. We show that the problem can be reformulated as conic quadratic mixed integer programming (CQMIP) problem which can be solved with commercial optimization software such as IBM ILOG CPLEX. Our computational experiments have shown that we could handle several simultaneous disruptions optimally on a four-hub network of a major U. S. airline within less than a minute on the average. We conclude that proposed approach is able to find optimal tradeoff between operating and passenger-related costs in real time. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
