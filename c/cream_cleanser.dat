It is also used as an adjunctive product in atopic dermatitis. The safety of personal care products used on vulnerable skin is of particular importance and the risk of developing further skin irritations and/or allergies should be minimized. Methods: In a series of studies, we tested the safety of personal care products containing oatmeal (<b>creams,</b> <b>cleansers,</b> lotions) by assessing their irritant/allergenic potential on repeat insult patch testing, in safety-in-use and ocular studies using subjects with nonsensitive and sensitive skin. We also tested the skin moisturizing and repair properties of an oatmeal-containing skin care product for dry skin. Results: We found that oatmeal-containing personal care products had very low irritant potential as well as a very low allergenic sensitization potential. Low-level reactions were documented in 1. 0 % of subjects during the induction phase of repeat insult patch testing; one of 2291 subjects developed a persistent but doubtful low-level reaction involving edema during the challenge phase in repeat insult patch testing. No allergies were reported by 80 subjects after patch testing after in-use application. Sustained skin moisturizing was documented in subjects with dry skin that lasted up to 2 weeks after product discontinuation. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that colloidal oatmeal is a safe and effective ingredient in personal care products. No allergies were reported by consumers of 445, 820 products sold during a 3 -year period.

40|$|Keratin is {{a natural}} protein {{extracted}} from the chicken feather. In the developed country, the usage of keratin in the personal care products is widely used. The personal care product produced from the keratin protein is conditioning shampoo, anti aging <b>cream,</b> facial <b>cleanser</b> and others. There are some differences between the personal care products already produced by the other developed country because the raw materials to extract the protein is sheep wool while in this research, the extraction of keratin protein is from chicken feathers.

50|$|Humectants are {{frequently}} used in cosmetics {{as a way}} of increasing and maintaining moisture in the skin and hair, in products including shampoo, conditioner, frizz serum, lotions, <b>creams,</b> lip treatments, <b>cleansers,</b> after-sun lotion, and some soaps or body lotions. As hygroscopic moisturizers, humectants work by attracting water to the upper layer of the skin (stratum corneum). All humectants have common hydroxyl groups which allow them to participate in hydrogen bonding and attract water. This process attracts moisture from the outer layer of the skin or, in high humidity, from the atmosphere. The moisture is then trapped against the epidermis or the shaft of the hair, depending on where the humectant is applied. Various humectants have different ways of behaving because they differ in water binding capacity at different humidities.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the potential use of some vegetal raw materials in personal-care products. Four ethanolic extracts (grape pomace, Pinus pinaster wood chips, Acacia dealbata flowers, and Lentinus edodes) were prepared and total phenolics, monomeric sugars, and antioxidant capacity were determined on alcoholic extracts. Six of the most important groups of cosmetics products (hand cream, body oil, shampoo, clay mask, body exfoliating <b>cream,</b> and skin <b>cleanser)</b> were formulated. Participants evaluated some sensory attributes and overall acceptance by a 10 -point scale; the results showed differences among age-intervals, but not between males and females. The results confirmed that all extracts presented characteristics appropriate for their use in cosmetic formulations and their good acceptability by consumers into all cosmetic products. Texture/appearance, spreadability, and skin feeling are important attributes among consumer expectations, but odor and color were the primary drivers and helped differentiate the natural extracts added into all personal-care products...|$|R
