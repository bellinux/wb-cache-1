30|$|In a {{previous}} study, the electrical properties of nonwoven (Lee 2011) and silk fabric (Lee 2012) coated with CNF/PVDF-HFP composites were reported. This {{study found that}} the electrical properties of CNF/PVDF-HFP coated nonwoven fabrics increased with increasing CNFs content, and of silk fabric increased with 4 % CNFs content. As well, Kang and Lee (2015) reported that in a preparation of carbon nanofiber composite-coated nylon fabric heating elements, surface temperatures of 16 wt% carbon nanofiber composite-coated fabrics reached 80  °C when 20  V was applied.

5000|$|An early story {{featuring}} {{something like}} mind uploading is the novella Izzard and the Membrane by Walter M. Miller, Jr., {{first published in}} May 1951. In this story, an American cyberneticist named Scott MacDonney is captured by Russians and made to work on an advanced computer, Izzard, which they plan to use to coordinate {{an attack on the}} United States. He has conversations with Izzard as he works on it, and when he asks it if it is self-aware, it says [...] "answer indeterminate" [...] and then asks [...] "can human individual's self-awareness transor be mechanically duplicated?" [...] MacDonney is unfamiliar with the concept of a self-awareness transor (it is later revealed that this information was loaded into Izzard by a mysterious entity who may nor may not be God), and Izzard defines it by saying [...] "A self-awareness transor is the mathematical function which describes the specific consciousness pattern of one human individual." [...] It is later found that this mathematical function can indeed be duplicated, although not by a detailed scan of the individual's brain as in later notions of mind uploading; instead, Donney just has to describe the individual verbally in sufficient detail, and Izzard uses this information to locate the transor in the appropriate [...] "mathematical region". In Izzard's words, [...] "to duplicate consciousness of deceased, it will be necessary for you to furnish anthropometric and psychic characteristics of the individual. These characteristics will not determine transor, but will only give its general form. Knowing its form, will enable me to sweep my <b>circuit</b> <b>pattern</b> through its mathematical region until the proper transor is reached. At that point, the consciousness will appear among the circuits." [...] Using this method, MacDonney is able to recreate the mind of his dead wife in Izzard's memory, as well as create a virtual duplicate of himself, which seems to have a shared awareness with the biological MacDonney.|$|E

The detection of irregularity in image is thus equivalent to the detection of die defect.

40|$|ASML {{is a world}} leading {{supplier}} of complex lithography machines for the semiconductor industry. A lithography machine consists of many subsystems, e. g., Light Source, Lens, Reticle handler, Reticle stage, Wafer handler and Wafer stage, which synchronize together to make the machine work. The Reticle stage holds the <b>circuit</b> <b>pattern,</b> also known as reticle and the Wafer stage module holds the wafer. The UV light from the light source is projected on the <b>circuit</b> <b>pattern,</b> which is then passed through the lens to imprint the pattern on the wafer. Since the <b>circuit</b> <b>pattern</b> has to be imprinted on the wafer, {{the movement of the}} modules; Reticle stage and Wafer stage should be synchronized in six degrees of freedom (DoF) with nanometer accuracy. To employ the movement of the subsystems, motion controllers are used in ASML, and Long Stroke and Short Stroke controllers are responsible for the movement of a part of the Wafer stage subsystem. It has been envisioned that future lithography machines, because of its high precision mechatronic requirements, will need motion control algorithms, that run at higher sampling frequencies with a severely reduced IO latency budget. Current hardware architectures {{will not be able to}} meet the demands of these future motion control algorithms. In this thesis, we propose an architecture, that uses a multi-ASIP in FPGA as an accelerator in conjunction with a CPU, which acts as a master to run the motion control applications. The proposal of using multi-ASIP FPGA in conjunction with CPU is based on the analysis carried out previously in ASML. It was observed that a sampling frequency exceeding 100 KHz can be obtained after deploying the Long Stroke controller and Short Stroke controller on a multi-ASIP platform in FPGA. However, this work considered only the data flow and not the supervisory control. After carrying out detailed analysis, we could predict that a sampling frequency of 40 KHz could be achieved by offloading the compute intensive blocks present in the Long Stroke and Short Stroke controller from the CPU to FPGA. The sampling frequency of 40 KHz can be achieved by considering, both the data flow and supervisory control, and the communication between the CPU and FPGA. Finally, after offloading the compute intensive blocks from the CPU on the multi-ASIP FPGA, and after implementing the data flow and supervisory control and communication mechanism between the CPU and FPGA, we can justify that the sampling frequency of 40 KHz can be achieved.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop fabric heating {{elements}} using CNF/PVDF-HFP composite coated cotton fabric with various <b>circuit</b> <b>patterns</b> with the aim of providing low cost, flexible, light, and uniform heating performance compared to conventional fabric heating elements. We prepared a carbon nanocomposite with electrical properties and it was coated cotton fabric with two types of <b>circuit</b> <b>patterns.</b> The sample code of P 0 designates a reference sample, while P 3, P 5 and P 7 were used when the number of horizontal lines was 3, 5, and 7, respectively; patterns in which a vertical line was added to the horizontal lines were named 2 P 3, 2 P 5, and 2 P 7, respectively. The surface resistivity values ranged from 1.01  ×  103 to 1.65  ×  103  Ω/sq, and it was thus confirmed that the samples with various <b>circuit</b> <b>patterns</b> exhibit excellent electrical characteristics. The resistances of P 3 and 2 P 3 were lower than those of fabric heaters with 5 and 7 lines, and it is thus presented that the effect of the resistance is less affected by the decrease in the number of lines. Comparing patterns, P 7, P 5 and P 3 showed slightly lower resistances than 2 P 7, 2 P 5 and 2 P 3, indicating that the line in the vertical direction slightly increased the resistance. For electrical heating temperature, P 7, P 5 and P 3 showed more uniform heating performance than P 0 and the circuit with the added vertical line had a higher surface temperature than P 7, P 5, and P 3 in terms of joule heating. 2 P 3 had the best heating performance, and the surface temperature was similar to P 0 at about 76  °C. In terms of mechanical properties and water repellency, it was confirmed that the coated fabrics had higher values compared to the uncoated fabric. Therefore, we confirmed that the electrical heating performance of the fabric heating element coated with carbon nanocomposite in three lines is improved compared to that of the plane fabric heating element, and it is also confirmed that it is more economical, flexible and lightweight than the conventional products because of its use of a smaller amount of carbon nanocomposite. Thus, it is suitable for use as a functional material for electric heating. Fabric heating elements that employ a CNF/PVDF-HFP composite with various <b>circuit</b> <b>patterns</b> have potential applicability in extreme work environments, for active winter sports, cold military training, and wet suits that must maintain body temperature in water.|$|R

In this paper, we design a mask that is robust against focus variations within the inverse lithography framework. Each iteration involves more computation than a similar method designed for the nominal conditions, but we simplify the task by using stochastic gradient descent, which is a technique from machine learning.
