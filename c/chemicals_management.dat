30|$|The {{scope of}} the {{conceptual}} framework is broad and intended {{to meet the demands}} of future <b>chemical</b> <b>management</b> on several levels including identification of chemical risks via experimental tools and models, prioritisation and risk assessment as well as evaluating abatement options. The conceptual framework refers to WFD-specific needs and obligations and is intended for regional, national and international (EU) authorities and organisations responsible for implementing the WFD and developing river basin management plans. The conceptual framework also includes sections focussing on policy development, scenarios and future risks. These sections are included to take into account future needs for water- and <b>chemical</b> <b>management</b> and are, thus, also directed to a broader end-user group, i.e. involved in development of future <b>chemicals</b> policy and <b>management</b> criteria.|$|R

It defines a policy framework to foster the sound worldwide management of chemicals. This initiative covers risk assessments of chemicals and harmonized labeling up to tackling obsolete and stockpiled products. Are included provisions for national centres aimed at helping in the developing world, train staff in chemical safety as well as dealing with spills and accidents. SAICM is a voluntary agreement.
