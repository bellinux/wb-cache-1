25|$|The opera was {{unfinished}} at {{the time}} of Puccini's death in 1924, and was completed by Franco Alfano in 1926. The first performance was held at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 25 April 1926 and conducted <b>by</b> Arturo <b>Toscanini.</b> This performance included only Puccini's music and not Alfano's additions. The first performance of the opera as completed by Alfano was the following night, 26 April, although it is disputed whether this was conducted <b>by</b> <b>Toscanini</b> again or <b>by</b> Ettore Panizza.|$|R

It included about 50 concerts that were never broadcast, but which were recorded surreptitiously by engineers supposedly testing their equipment.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, Bruno Walter, who was {{the only}} {{conductor}} fully accepted <b>by</b> <b>Toscanini,</b> concentrated himself on majors works of Mozart, presented a highly acclaimed production of Glucks Orfeo ed Euridice and expanded the Salzburg repertory by adding rarely performed operas like Wolfs Der Corregidor and Webers Euryanthe.

5000|$|... the composers {{whose works}} {{have been most}} {{frequently}} performed by the IPO were Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms, Mendelssohn and Dvořák. The initial concerts of the Palestine Orchestra in December 1936, conducted <b>by</b> <b>Toscanini,</b> featured the music of Richard Wagner. However, after the Kristallnacht pogroms in November 1938, the orchestra has maintained a de facto ban on Wagner's work, due to that composer's antisemitism and the association of his music with Nazi Germany.|$|R

Shortly after his graduation, Shaw {{was hired by}} popular band leader Fred Waring to recruit and train a glee club that would sing with the band. In 1941, Shaw founded the Collegiate Chorale, a group notable in its day for its racial integration. In 1948, the group performed Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 with the NBC Symphony and Arturo Toscanini, who famously remarked, [...] "In Robert Shaw I have at last found the maestro I have been looking for." [...] Shaw continued to prepare choirs for Toscanini until March 1954, when they sang in Te Deum by Verdi and the prologue to Mefistofele by Boito. Shaw's choirs participated in the NBC broadcast performances of three Verdi operas: Aida, Falstaff and A Masked Ball, all conducted <b>by</b> <b>Toscanini.</b> They {{can be seen on}} the home videos of the telecasts of Aida (from 1949) and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony (from April 1948), also conducted <b>by</b> <b>Toscanini.</b> Shaw himself took a bow {{at the end of the}} Beethoven telecast.|$|R

5000|$|Martucci was championed <b>by</b> Arturo <b>Toscanini</b> {{during much}} of the latter's career. The NBC Symphony Orchestra {{performed}} a number of Martucci's orchestral works in 1938, 1940, 1941, 1946, and 1953; although the performances were preserved on transcription discs, none was approved for commercial release <b>by</b> <b>Toscanini.</b> All of these performances have been given unofficial release in recent years, on LP as well as CD format. NBC musical director Samuel Chotzinoff, in his 1956 book [...] "Toscanini--An Intimate Portrait", said that every time the Maestro proposed scheduling Martucci's works, certain orchestra members and NBC authorities objected; but the conductor was not to be deterred. Some Toscanini biographers (including Mortimer Frank and Harvey Sachs) have questioned the merit of the compositions, speculating that Toscanini may have performed them {{out of a sense of}} duty.|$|R

50|$|Massimo Filippo Antongiulio Maria Freccia (19 September 1906 - 16 November 2004) was an Italian American conductor. He had an {{international}} reputation but never held a post as {{music director of}} a major orchestra or opera house. Unusually for an Italian, he built his career around symphonic music rather than opera. For several years he was an assistant to Arturo Toscanini, whom he venerated, and he was regularly invited <b>by</b> <b>Toscanini</b> to conduct the NBC Symphony Orchestra.|$|R
