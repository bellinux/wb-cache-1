5|$|Although most of {{the judging}} had been {{completed}} before the fire, suggestions {{at the time that}} the committee <b>could</b> <b>use</b> what they had learned from the entrants to propose a new competition with greater clarity as to the requirements led to naught: a 1925 letter to the then Premier John Gunn reveals that there was little to be learned from the competition, as the assessors had found that none of the designs were suitable.|$|E
5000|$|The mile, yard, {{foot and}} inch <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> on road traffic signs, {{distance}} and speed measurement, pints <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> {{for the sale}} of milk in returnable containers and for the measurement of draught beer and cider, acres <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> for purposes of land registration and troy ounces <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> when dealing with precious metals until a date to be determined by the states in question.|$|R

5|$|An {{additional}} six rehearsal studios {{with high}} ceilings and no obstructions. The Joffrey <b>could</b> <b>use</b> these for classes if it starts a school here. For now {{they will be}} the site of activities related to the Joffrey's extensive outreach school programs.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{remedy for}} farmers of pollinated crops {{is simply to}} switch from using beekeepers {{to the use of}} native bees, such as bumble bees and mason bees. Native bees can be helped to establish themselves by providing suitable nesting locations and some additional crops the bees <b>could</b> <b>use</b> to feed from (e.g. when the pollination season of the commercial crops on the farm has ended).|$|E
5|$|As Oregon City {{was founded}} and European {{settlers}} began {{moving to the}} area, they petitioned their governments to remove the local natives from the land, so that the settlers <b>could</b> <b>use</b> it for farming and housing. The government allocated a reservation for the natives and re-appropriated Gladstone for redevelopment.|$|E
5000|$|Only a {{keyboard}} <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> {{for the majority}} of the gameplay, since most of the user input was by text. A joystick <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> for the arcade sequence.|$|R
50|$|Inulin {{produced}} by T. kok-saghyz is a sugar that <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> in non-food applications or {{be turned into}} bioethanol through fermentation. The remaining plant biomass <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> to produce biogas.|$|R
30|$|These {{observations}} {{raise the}} interesting {{possibility that this}} approach <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> as a method that points towards amino acids found at the interface between two domains of a protein. In particular, it <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> in support of predictive models for intermolecular contacts. It is indeed sometimes difficult to obtain crystals of multidomain proteins, and research must rely on isolated domains structures. The approach we <b>used</b> <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> in virtually all mutidomain proteins, and help identify interaction areas if these are not known from crystal structures.|$|R
5|$|But at {{that same}} moment this thought came into my mind. Don't let me find him! If only I could {{get rid of this}} dead weight, so that I <b>could</b> <b>use</b> all my {{strength}} to struggle for my own survival, and only worry about myself. Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever.|$|E
5|$|Convoys from Britain {{lacked the}} surface vessel escort after 13°W. Hudsons could only make sweeps up to 17°W but lacked {{endurance}} to stay there. From Gibraltar, {{the lack of}} flying boats meant a lack of air cover after 100 miles. Nevertheless, great efforts were made with limited resources to provide cover from first to last light, the time when U-boats <b>could</b> <b>use</b> the rising and setting sun to see the silhouettes on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Each team's squad {{consisted}} of 18 players (two of whom must be goalkeepers). Teams also had two additional reserve players they <b>could</b> <b>use</b> as replacements {{in the event}} of serious injury, at any time. During a match, all remaining squad members not named in the starting team are available {{to be one of the}} three permitted substitutions (provided the player is not serving a suspension).|$|E
40|$|Glucosamine被發現具有舒緩關節炎的效果，而chitosanase具有水解chitosan成為glucosamine的能力。因此由Bacillus菌株中選殖到chitosanase基因，並將此基因在E. coli及Bacillus表現系統中進行大量表現，所得到的酵素可用於生產glucosamine。本研究將利用培養基的組成及誘導的條件來提升chitosanase的產量，並建立chitosanase水解chitosan生產glucosamine之最佳條件，以提供工業界所需。Glucosamine <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> to relief osteoarthritis. Chitosanase is {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes the {{hydrolysis}} of chitosan to glucosamine. The gene encoding chitosanase was cloned from Bacillus subtilis and overexpressed in E. coli and B. subtilis. Glucosamine production <b>could</b> <b>used</b> this purified enzyme which increase production level by medium composition and induction conditions. The optimal {{conditions for the}} conversion of chitosan to glucosamine will be established for the industrial applications...|$|R
50|$|This {{synthesis}} gas <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> to produce gasoline via the Fischer-Tropsch process. Alternatively, the liquid intermediates that are formed during the incomplete {{conversion of the}} biomass <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> for fuel and plastic production.|$|R
5|$|After the Revolution, {{the village}} of Pittsburgh {{continued}} to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building. Flatboats <b>could</b> <b>used</b> to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver.|$|R
5|$|For a {{few weeks}} in 1972, he and his parents and sister lived at Lemmons, the north London home of Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Jane Howard. Cecil Day-Lewis had cancer and Howard invited the family to Lemmons as a place they <b>could</b> <b>use</b> to rest and recuperate. Cecil died there in May that year.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, several {{software}} and hardware improvements were introduced for Juniper routers, including a series of software applications ISPs <b>could</b> <b>use</b> to provide internet-based services to consumers. In December 2014, Juniper introduced a network switch, OCX1100, that could run on either the Junos operating system or the Open Compute Project open-source software.|$|E
5|$|In March 1965, a NOTAM {{was issued}} of changes {{had been made}} into the {{arrangements}} for light aircraft crossing the Channel. These changes were partly to avoid conflict with traffic flying into Lydd (Ferryfield). Non-radio aircraft <b>could</b> <b>use</b> the route between Hythe and Ambleteuse. Non-radio aircraft were advised to call at Lympne before crossing. On 11 July, one of Skyways Coach Air's Avro 748s crashed on landing at Lympne.|$|E
5000|$|The White Top: With {{the seats}} in place, the White Top <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> for family transportation. With the seats removed, it <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> for light work. The White Top {{could be found in}} farms across America.|$|R
25|$|In Burma, {{where the}} {{distances}} involved {{were not so}} great, Dakota transport aircraft <b>could</b> be <b>used.</b> Westland Lysander liaison aircraft <b>could</b> also be <b>used</b> over shorter distances.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, GLIAS {{began to}} develop a {{database}} which <b>could</b> <b>used</b> to record site information in London. The intention {{was to make the}} database compatible with the IRIS data standard, and the first version was essentially an electronic IRIS form.|$|R
5|$|In his 1892 work La planète Mars et ses {{conditions}} d'habitabilité, Camille Flammarion {{wrote about}} how these channels resembled man-made canals, which an intelligent race <b>could</b> <b>use</b> to redistribute water across a dying Martian world. He advocated {{for the existence of}} such inhabitants, and suggested they may be more advanced than humans.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, fans {{attending}} Super Bowl XLV, {{the first}} Super Bowl since the iPad was released, <b>could</b> <b>use</b> an official National Football League (NFL) app to navigate Cowboys Stadium. In 2011, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers {{became the first}} NFL club to discontinue the use of paper copies of playbooks, and instead distributed all players their playbook and videos in electronic format via an iPad 2.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{asked if}} they <b>could</b> <b>use</b> {{something}} like Steven Sykes's dummy railhead which had worked so well at Misheifa. Barkas answered {{that he intended to}} build a dummy water pipeline to go down south, and to be obviously not ready.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on {{the meaning}} of [...] "nation" [...] used, the term [...] "nation state" [...] <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> to {{distinguish}} larger states from small city states, or <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> to distinguish multinational states from those with a single ethnic group.|$|R
500|$|Other constructions <b>could</b> also be <b>used.</b> [...] For {{instance}} the complete rear legs <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> with the sciatic nerves exposed {{so that the}} nerve of one frog could {{be connected to the}} feet of the next. [...] Whole frogs too <b>could</b> be <b>used.</b> [...] Although it was more time consuming to prepare the thigh muscles, most experimenters preferred to do this since it gave better results.|$|R
40|$|Parallelism <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> {{to provide}} better {{performance}} to heavy applications, while design patterns <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> to facilitate their design. There {{is a wide}} range of applications that rely on large hierarchical structures, like trees. A set of design patterns are presented that <b>could</b> be <b>used</b> to model such applications in a parallel and distributed way. This paper also presents the modeling of several parallel and distributed applications to which the presented set of design patterns are applied...|$|R
5|$|Since lahars were {{produced}} repeatedly, scientists {{realized that they}} <b>could</b> <b>use</b> these to analyze a trial period for a newly developed device proposed to measure the movement of rocks against each other. This device, now known as an Acoustic Flow Monitor, alerts nearby stations to possible lahars.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{created the}} game using 96K of memory, which limited the file size of individual graphics and sound effects they <b>could</b> <b>use.</b> The memory limits also prohibited Newcomer from creating more characters. The graphics were created at the pixel level and hand-animated. To animate the birds, Hendricks used Eadweard Muybridge's book Animals In Motion as a reference. Given the limited memory, {{she had to}} balance the number of frames to minimize file size, while maintaining realistic animation. Hendricks originally picked gray for the buzzards, but chose green instead to optimize the color palette as the developers had only 16colors to create the visuals. Once the colors were decided for the character sprites, Newcomer finalized {{the look of the}} platforms. The hardware had limited audio capabilities, and sounds typically required larger amounts of memory than graphics. Working with these restrictions, Newcomer instructed Murphy and Kotlarik to focus on select sounds he deemed important to reinforcing gameplay. He reasoned that the audio would serve as conspicuous hints that players <b>could</b> <b>use</b> to adjust their strategy. Though Newcomer prioritized the wing flap, other sound effects like those related to the pterodactyl, collisions, and hatching eggs were considered important as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} mallets {{used by the}} player could also vary as well. For most occasions, only one mallet is used but for other techniques, the player <b>could</b> <b>use</b> two mallets, one in each hand. An even more {{interesting}} technique uses only one balu but requires the player to play the agung in reverse order of pitches. Called patuy, this technique and the one with two mallets are normally reserved only for competition and exhibition instances.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, memoization <b>could</b> be <b>used.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{method was}} invented by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac. Justus von Liebig studied the method while working with Gay-Lussac between 1822 and 1824 and {{improved}} the method in the following years to a level that it <b>could</b> <b>used</b> as standard procedure for organic analysis.|$|R
60|$|This latter {{alternative}} is always permissible, therefore I <b>could</b> have <b>used</b> my short-sword, my dagger, my hatchet, or my fists had I wished, and been entirely within my rights, but I <b>could</b> not <b>use</b> firearms or a spear while he held only his long-sword.|$|R
