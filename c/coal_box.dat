50|$|The steam {{locomotives}} {{of class}} U and Uu on the Ryazan-Ural railway were equipped with distinctive four-axle semicircular tenders for 23 m³ {{of water and}} 8.2 t of oil, that were designed specifically for them {{at the request of}} the railway. The class U locomotives that worked on other railways had the normal 3 or 4 axle rectangular tenders with water tanks and <b>coal</b> <b>box.</b> Later some locomotives were modernized and equipped superheaters. These locomotives have received the designation “Uch” (Russian: УЧ).|$|E
50|$|Griesbach enlisted {{with the}} Canadian Mounted Rifles in 1899 {{to fight in}} the Second Boer War. He knew from being weighed in at boxing tournaments that he fell short of the minimum 140 lb weight to enlist, so on his way to being weighed he surreptitiously grabbed a large piece of coal from the {{enlistment}} centre's <b>coal</b> <b>box</b> and held it behind his back while he stood on the scales. During his service, he was awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal and received four bars.|$|E

He may go down with us again, for I expect he likes our bill of fare better than that of his boarding house.|$|R
500|$|The Mount Sion {{steam crane}} (a {{depiction}} {{of which is}} used as the logo of the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal Society) sits rusting and unused at Mount Sion, on the Bury arm. [...] One of the earliest surviving cranes in England, it was built some time about 1875–1884 for Mount Sion Bleach Works by Thomas Smith & Sons of Rodley and was used to unload <b>coal</b> <b>boxes</b> from barges into the yard below the canal. [...] It was granted Grade II listed status in 2011.|$|R
50|$|From {{the late}} 18th century, Usk became {{well known for}} the high quality of its japanware, a process of decorating metals by {{applying}} a lacquer to tinplate. The process, known as Pontypool japan, was first developed in the west by Thomas Allgood of nearby Pontypool and was taken on in Usk in 1763 by his grandsons Thomas and Edward Allgood. Products from Usk included tin trays, jardinières, and <b>coal</b> <b>boxes.</b> However output declined with changing fashions in the 19th century, and the last Usk japanware was produced in 1860 {{on the site of}} what is now Bunning's builders' merchants.|$|R
5000|$|The Buggy {{was modeled}} after a US-built steam car Taylor {{had seen in}} 1864. It was {{designed}} by Taylor to have a coal-fired boiler for the carriage. Fully pressurized, the steam was used to move a piston attached to the rear axle, producing forward motion. The vehicle {{does not have a}} reverse gear or brakes. It was able to travel at a sustained 24 km/h. The vehicle features thin strips of metal bent {{around the edge of the}} wheels in place of rubber tires. It is powered by a two-cylinder boiler mounted behind the driver. Steam is generated in the vertical coal-fired boiler, which is connected by rubber hoses to a six-gallon water tank located between the front wheels. [...] The vehicle lacks a <b>coal</b> <b>box,</b> but has a storage nook for lump coal or wood under the driver’s perch.|$|E
50|$|The {{grade was}} built for the Biggar-Loverna line of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in 1912, and steel was laid in 1913. The {{construction}} of the rail site in Coleville began in 1913 {{with the construction of}} the railway station and <b>coal</b> <b>box.</b> Jack Binks, section foreman, was the station's first occupant, and George Barrett was the first station agent. After the construction of the station, a water well was required for the steam engines. In 1914 a two-pen, four-car stock yard and hog chute were built, and an 18 metre (60 foot) well was dug by hand. A pump house was built, and the Coleville water tower, which is still in use today, was erected. The first pumpman was Mike Crown. The Bigger-Loverna line became part of the Canadian National Railway in 1923. The section toolhouse was built in 1926, and in 1953 a two-car loading platform was built, and an electric pump was installed in the pumphouse.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on a {{research}} project aimed at measuring temperature gradients and radon concentrations in boreholes. This was done by observing radon activity and temperature profiles in twelve boreholes that were investigated between October 2012 and May 2013. The boreholes located in Bergen and Osterøy were drilled for extracting underground heat by means of heat pumps and heat exchangers at shallow depths. Underground heat flow results from the decay process of radioactive elements such as U- 235, U- 238, Th- 232, and K- 40 with high concentrations in granitic rocks. Using this the total energy of decay chain of U- 238 to Pb- 208 was calculated to understand how much energy located in the ground was due to uranium. Temperature profiles were measured in bore holes by means of sensitive temperature sensors. The logger reads temperature in 10 second intervals. Samples were recorded for 60 and 30 sec at each depth (5 m). The time however was not long enough for the logger to have stable temperature readings. Therefore, the temperature logger calibration was performed for an unbiased estimate of the temperature at each depth. The logger was placed in a container full of ice water for 15 minutes. Obtained calibration data were plotted on the same figure with the measured data. Figures show in total a variation in some points near the surface. Radon calibration by using a canary meter with a radioactive source and coalboxes sealed in a plastic box for three days at the laboratory room was used to determine the calibration constant K to be used in field measurements. Energy calibration was done in order to convert the channel number to energy by using known energy values of isotopes such as Cs- 137, Na- 22, and Ra- 226 to determine the energy for unknown sources. Radon concentration was detected by placing <b>coal</b> <b>boxes</b> on top of boreholes in order to absorb radon gas. They were left for three days because the half-life of radon is about three days. The <b>coal</b> <b>boxes</b> were then placed in a gamma ray detector for gamma spectroscopy. Clear peaks were noted from area 2 bore holes, which indicates high radon concentration emanated from boreholes in such area. Results shown in this thesis were taken from twelve water boreholes: four 250 m deep holes at the Haukeland university hospital (area 1), three 180 m deep holes in Osterøy (area 2), four 210 m deep holes in Åsane (area 3), and one 500 m deep hole in Fyllingsdalen (area 4) Thermal studies show no variation between bore holes, whereas radon concentration is hole dependent. No significant correlation was observed between thermal energy and radon concentration. The next few chapters in this thesis are presenting the results of the Rn- 222 concentration and temperature data in boreholes...|$|R

He was further honoured {{when he was}} appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 1939, [...] "for public services", and made Viscount Hyndley, of Meads in the County of Sussex, in 1947. Lord Hyndley was also master of the Clothworkers' Company in 1953. The Viscount Hyndley Trophy was a trophy awarded to the British National <b>Coal</b> Board <b>boxing</b> champion.|$|R
50|$|In 1837, {{the first}} pit for the {{extraction}} of steam coal was sunk at Abernant-y-Groes by Thomas Wayne and his family. Wayne had previously been the Clerk for the canal company. An entrepreneur called Thomas Powell started another pit at Tyr Founder in 1840, and hit the Four Foot seam two years later. Fifteen more pits were sunk in the Cynon Valley between 1840 and 1853, {{and a number of}} basins and tramways were constructed to facilitate export of the coal. Thomas Powell negotiated the right to carry <b>coal</b> in <b>boxes</b> in the boats, as a way to reduce breakage and ease handling of the product, with the empty boxes not incurring tolls on the return journey.|$|R

40|$|Demands for heat, {{processing}} energy, irrigation, tractors, harvesters {{and other}} energy needs (all in Peta Joules) are met through various technologies and fuel sources. Technologies using liquid fossil fuels (tractors, harvesters and pumps using diesel or petrol) {{are able to}} use a bio-fossil fuel blend. Tractors and harvesters are also able to run on pure bio-ethanol or bio-diesel for {{a case in which}} a farmer may be producing his own biofuel for use in farm vehicles. Demand for energy increases in time with respect to the agricultural GDP. Fuels come from refineries or mines, in the case of <b>coal,</b> and dummy <b>boxes</b> along fuel paths allow for accounting for each specific sector...|$|R
50|$|The Shillingstone Railway Project (formerly the Shillingstone Station Project) is a {{heritage}} railway project based at Shillingstone railway {{station on the}} former Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. It {{is supported by the}} North Dorset Railway Trust (NDRT). The medium-term aim is to restore the current leased length of 46 mi to 46 mi from Bath Junction: an addition of 1200 ft of single track mainline with a loop through the platforms. The signal <b>box,</b> <b>coal</b> store, motor trolley hut, permanent way huts, signals and pole route will also be rebuilt, the signalling being controlled by the box in time. The North Dorset trailway runs alongside the formation and up over the 395 ft 'down' platform.|$|R
30|$|Coal {{charging}} and seal. Certain 70 -mesh {{stainless steel}} wire meshes were placed under the cribriform ventilation device {{at the bottom of}} the experimental platform primary <b>box.</b> <b>Coal</b> granules cannot cross the steel wire meshes, so the cribriform ventilation device under the steel wire meshes would not be blocked by coal granules. With the steel wire meshes in place, a layer of stones (10  cm thick; 20, 10 and 5  mm diameter) was laid to enable even gas to charge. After the stone paving had been laid, several 70 -mesh steel wire meshes were placed on the stone layer. The stable stone pad forms the structure of the gas-charging base. The prepared coal is placed into a primary box and tamped. Pressure, stress and temperature sensors were placed in the coal sample at different layers and locations. The top shell was set in place and sealed. Leak detection was conducted to ensure that the experimental box was airtight.|$|R
