50|$|After good initial {{audience}} figures, {{the audiences}} started dropping. Mainly {{this could be}} attributed to the increasing competition from the then dominant Radio Clyde stations as well as other local stations. After outgrowing its base in Lady Lane in the West End of Paisley, it relocated to an industrial unit in Kinning Park in neighbouring Glasgow, a move outside the broadcasting area, which was seen by locals of Paisley as a snub, a <b>claim</b> <b>management</b> denied and stated that it was {{due to a lack of}} affordable suitable property in Renfrewshire. A management change at this time saw the station rebranding itself as 96.3 QFM. The move to Glasgow and rebranding were announced on air as welcoming people to a 'new station' and 'Glasgow's QFM'. With sensitivities about the move from Paisley still high, this, as well as a lack of Renfrewshire material, saw complaints to Ofcom which duly warned the station about ignoring its licence requirements for that stated it broadcast to Renfrewshire and must include Renfrewshire material. The move to Glasgow was accompanied in an attempt to capture the falling audience by taking on rival stations with a move to a format of mainly pop and chart music from the present day. This saw limited success due to the saturation of the area from similar stations.|$|E

40|$|Claims {{on quality}} {{problems}} are valuable {{sources of information}} to improve <b>claim</b> <b>management.</b> Addressing individual claim resolution and aggregating claim data analysis are focused for the <b>claim</b> <b>management.</b> After new products are released, <b>claim</b> <b>management</b> should be carried out as follows: detecting major quality problems as early as possible, performing immediate remedy, finding {{the root cause of}} problems, implementing measures for the root cause and then confirming their effects. For each step, both qualitative and quantitative analyses are important for improving <b>claim</b> <b>management.</b> 　Due to having a particular cause per each claim, each claim has a specific number of claims per month. This thesis proposes two analysis methods focusing on this feature which are effective for the claim data analysis. One method is for detecting major quality problems, and the other is for examining effectiveness of actions taken. The former analysis has the advantage of accuracy and a timely detection. Cumulative Sum Control Chart (CUSUM) is applied for detecting major quality problems. The properties of CUSUM design parameters, which are not investigated in the previous research, are investigated in this thesis for drawing out a scheme of detection in a <b>claim</b> <b>management.</b> In the latter analysis, a comprehensive and significant testing method by using Quality <b>Claim</b> <b>Management</b> Matrix (QCMM) is proposed. Claim data over certain intervals for the analysis is required for the proposed method. In order to examine the effectiveness of actions taken, hypothesis tests are performed. Likelihood functions for grouped claim under the null and alternative hypotheses are developed and used to calculate the likelihood ratio statistic for testing the effectiveness of actions taken. In addition, the proposed method and the previous one are comparatively analyzed. Two application examples that were provided by two companies are used for the purpose of giving an illustration. Each example has a quality problem with a single cause. 　The two proposed methods can be applied in a flexible way by using one or both of them. Moreover, this thesis provides CUSUM design parameters and power values of likelihood ratio test in tables, which cover a wide range of number of claims per month and are able to apply to various quality problems of products and their various claim rates. They are easy to be carried out and useful to analyze claim data corresponding to problems in any industrial world. 電気通信大学 201...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examined}} the challenges {{associated with the}} management of the dual EQC-private insurance model offered in New Zealand after the Canterbury earthquake disasters. A mixed-methods approach comprising survey and semi-structured interviews were adopted in the study. The research findings highlighted key challenges associated with the dual insurance model that impeded post-disaster residential reconstruction. These challenges include policy holder’s lack of knowledge of insurance policy underwritings and entitlements, high cost of insurance premiums and deductibles, and a complicated <b>claim</b> <b>management</b> process. Main recommendations proposed from this study to improve the post-disaster claims management processes, should another earthquake occur include ensuring property owners’ due diligence, adopting a simplified and streamlined insurance <b>claim</b> <b>management</b> approach, good communication approach and providing clarity and consistency in policy underwritings and legislative provisions governing the dual insurance scheme. The findings highlight the significance of a streamlined approach to insurance claims evaluation and management in pre-disaster planning and post-disaster reconstruction. falsefalsefals...|$|E

40|$|The {{theory that}} the {{prospect}} of liability for damages deters risky behavior has been developed in countless articles and books. The literature is far sparser, however, on how deterrence is operationalized. And prior work slights an equally important effect of damage actions, to incentivize <b>claims</b> <b>management</b> in addition to harm-reduction responses that are cost- rather than liabilityminimizing. This article works in the intersection of these two understudied areas, focusing on <b>claims</b> <b>management</b> steps taken by frequently sued organizations, and opening {{a window into the}} black box of deterrence to see how those steps may end up serving harm-reduction purposes as well. To summarize, I observe that damage actions regulate risky enterprise by inducing organizations to develop <b>claims</b> <b>management</b> capabilities—that is, the capacity to process any resulting disputes. I then argue that these <b>claims</b> <b>management</b> practices and personnel are sometimes used, secondarily but importantly, to improve safety, reduce risk, and increase compliance with external legal requirements. Organizations’ internal <b>claims</b> <b>management</b> operations can, though they need not, facilitate care-taking in four important ways: (a) promoting the gathering and analysis of claims information; (b) requiring the hiring of specialized personnel with a mission to reduce claim payouts; (c) encouraging bureaucratized procedures that may be harm-reducing, and (d) increasing the salience of claims to various actors within the organization. I discuss the theory underlying these four points, drawing on organizational economics and sociology, as well as on psychology and behavioral law and economics. Then I discuss these four channels of influence in particular factual settings which serve as case studies, looking at a single large retailer, and then more generally at hospitals and hospital doctors, and jails and prisons. Because organizational theory tells us that this kind of transformation or repurposing is quite ordinary, the preliminary evidence I canvass suggests that <b>claims</b> <b>management</b> should be included in any study of how damage action deterrence is operationalized within large risk-creating organizations. This article thus makes two chief scholarly contributions. It proposes and theorizes concrete operational paths by which damage actions may elicit organizational compliance with external norms. And it describes in-house <b>claims</b> <b>management,</b> a heretofore underobserved arena in which law influences organizational activity. In the conclusion, I propose that who performs <b>claims</b> <b>management</b> functions may matter, as well, and suggest that in future research, <b>claims</b> <b>management</b> should be considered along with liability and loss prevention as the trio of liability-related operational areas in which firms must implement a “make-or-buy” decision...|$|R
