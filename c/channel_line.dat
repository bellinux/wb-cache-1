40|$|AbstractThis study {{provides}} a cost-effectiveness analysis of four water-saving irrigation techniques that are widely implemented in China {{to address the}} impacts of climate change: sprinkler irrigation, micro-irrigation, low-pressure pipe irrigation and <b>channel</b> <b>lining.</b> The aim is to thoroughly understand the economic feasibility of water-saving irrigation as an approach to coping with climate change. Based on the cost-effectiveness analysis, this study finds that water-saving irrigation is cost-effective in coping with climate change, and has benefits for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and for sustainable economic development. For the cost-effectiveness ratio of mitigation and adaptation, only that of <b>channel</b> <b>lining</b> is negative (for mitigation is − 43. 02 to − 73. 41 US$/t, for grain yield increase − 34. 35 to − 20. 13 US$/t, and for water saving − 0. 020 to − 0. 012 US$/m 3). Sprinkler irrigation has the highest incremental cost for mitigation (476. 03 – 691. 64 US$/t), because when sprinkler irrigation is used, there may be additional energy needs to meet water pressure requirements, which may increase greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional irrigation. For mitigation, in districts where the pumping head for pressure {{is lower than the}} critical energy saving head, sprinkler irrigation should be avoided. Micro-irrigation has the highest incremental cost for adaptation followed by sprinkler irrigation and low-pressure pipe irrigation, but when considering the revenues from improved adaptation, all of the measures assessed are economically feasible. The results suggest that for mitigation and adaptation objectives, micro-irrigation performs best. From an economic perspective, <b>channel</b> <b>lining</b> is recommended. Therefore, a balanced development of <b>channel</b> <b>lining</b> and micro-irrigation according to different geographical conditions is recommended...|$|R

50|$|Reversals are {{considered}} to be stronger signals if their extreme point is even further up or down than the current trend would have achieved if it continued as before, e.g. a bullish reversal would have a low that is below the approximate line formed by the lows of the preceding bear trend. This is an 'overshoot'. See the section #Trend <b>channel</b> <b>line</b> overshoot.|$|E
50|$|A trend <b>channel</b> <b>line</b> {{overshoot}} {{refers to}} the price shooting clear out of the observable trend channel further {{in the direction of}} the trend. An overshoot does not have to be a reversal bar, since it can occur during a with-trend bar. On occasion it may not result in a reversal at all, it will just force the price action trader to adjust the trend channel definition.|$|E
