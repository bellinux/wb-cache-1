500|$|In the {{official}} RCA Records Billboard magazine memorial, {{his life was}} summed up in these words: [...] "50 years of music and a life well lived. An example to all." [...] Composer Ervin Drake said of him, [...] "...ccasionally someone like Perry <b>comes</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> won't 'go with the flow' and still prevails {{in spite of all}} the bankrupt others who surround him and importune him to yield to their values. Only occasionally." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{releasing}} the successful debut album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992), TLC {{began working on}} the their second release called CrazySexyCool in late 1993 and continued through till September 1994. One of the album's tracks, [...] "Creep", was based on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins' own experience. She recalled it for Billboard: [...] "You're with a guy and he's not showing you attention, so another guy <b>comes</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> you're like, 'Hey, if you were where {{you were supposed to}} be, he couldn't be showing me attention right now!' I {{was in the middle of}} this drama, because the other guy was [...] friend, and my boyfriend was just not getting it together." [...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We thought that was a good relationship to talk about because a lot of people don't admit that's how they feel – that their man's playing on them and they want to be with him so they seek attention elsewhere, but they really want to be with their guy," [...] she added.|$|E
500|$|Bass's {{announcement}} {{received a}} large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving [...] "overwhelming support" [...] from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync. However, Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as [...] "straight-acting" [...] in his People interview, stating, [...] "I call them the SAGs— the straight-acting gays. We're just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer." [...] This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes. In a 2007 interview with The Advocate, Bass called his comment a [...] "mistake" [...] and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term. Bass stated, [...] "Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last civil rights movement we have left here in America. So when someone new like myself <b>comes</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can see how people would get pissed." ...|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were not}} as positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. [...] The two criticized the idea that Scully would give her child up for {{adoption}} solely based on the word of Jeffrey Spender, noting [...] "if she wasn't {{going to give it}} away for the sake of its own protection after a UFO cult abducted it , then why should she because Jeffrey Spender of all people <b>comes</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> informs her that it's under threat?" [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, did praise Chris Owens' acting, writing that he did a [...] "great job". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, wrote a largely negative review of the episode and derided its plot. He heavily criticized the idea that Scully would offer William up for adoption. Kessenich did however praise Duchovny's directing, noting that [...] " [...] did a masterful job of luring me back to this world of The X-Files". Aaron Kinney from Salon wrote that the episode [...] "scuttled the entire" [...] baby William subplot. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the decision to conclude the William subplot but called the episode's conclusion [...] "sappy".|$|E

[...] He teaches Benjamin how to throw the bombs and says that it will free Arion. [...] Benjamin and Reuben then proceed to the Mine and free Arion. [...] Arion tells some tales of how the Fire Crystal has gone berserk, and Reuben goes off with Benjamin to the Volcano to stop the Vile Evil from stealing the crystal's power.

[...] They decide to head to Windia, and Reuben is ambushed by monsters and falls off the rope bridge. [...] Tristam <b>comes</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> helps Benjamin cross the bridge, but they are stymied by a tree who won't talk to them. [...] Tristam says {{that there is a}} gal in Foresta who can talk to tree spirits, and the two drop in on Aquaria where Kaeli was trying to find Spencer. [...] Benjamin and Tristam go down into the tunnel and find Spencer, who tells Tristam of a great treasure. [...] They leave, and Phoebe plants a bomb that collapses a tunnel Spencer was building. [...] She leaves to tell Spencer what happened, and Benjamin takes Kaeli to the Alive Forest to talk to the dormant tree spirit.

The only experiences to which I can compare my own discovery of the Goons are going to see N F Simpson's play One Way Pendulum... or, later on, hearing Peter Cook for the first time.

2500|$|There is also {{a similar}} Secwepemc story. [...] In this account, Coyote is marveling at how easy Spider can {{go up and down}} his web.

[...] Of course it doesn't work, and coyote gets stuck. [...] Luckily, Spider <b>comes</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> frees Coyote.

2500|$|According to Cowboy Jack Clement, {{who took}} over {{production}} duties from Sam Phillips, [...] "There's two heads; one records, and one plays back. The sound <b>comes</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> it's recorded on this head, and a split second later, {{it goes to the}} playback head. But you can take that and loop it to where it plays a split second after it was recorded and it flips right back into the record head. Or, you can have a separate machine and do that. if you do it on one machine, you have to echo everything." [...] In more technical terms a tape delay and a 7-ips, instead of the more advanced 15-ips. The recordings were thus an idealized representation of the customary live sound.|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, when he {{was barely}} four years old, Connolly's mother {{abandoned}} her children while their father was serving as an engineer in the Royal Air Force in Burma. [...] "I've never felt abandoned by her", Connolly explained in 2009. [...] "My mother was a teenager. My father was in Burma, fighting a bloody war. The Germans were dropping all kinds of crap on the town. We lived at the docks, so that's where all the bombs were happening. She was a teenager with two kids in a slum. A guy <b>comes</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> says, 'I love you. Come with me.' Given the choice, I think I'd have gone with him.

2500|$|Davis, on his {{commentary}} in Billboard magazine {{the issue}} of January 18, 1986, pointed out the misapplication of the literal meaning or the board of trustees' rules, stating that [...] " [...] is often a matter of opinion. , {{it became obvious that}} this NARAS rule had been interpreted very liberally in the past." [...] According to his review of each past winner and nominee, some artists such as Cyndi Lauper, Luther Vandross, the Power Station, Carly Simon, and Crosby, Stills & Nash, had already received credits on other albums or been previously very well known as a member of other acts prior to their Grammy nominations. He added that [...] "it is a conspicuous injustice that Whitney will not be getting her shot. When someone <b>comes</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> makes an impact such as Whitney has, it'll come as a big surprise to quite a few people that, according to the rules of NARAS, sometimes new isn't New." ...|$|E
2500|$|His second album, Be'govah Mishtane ("Changing Altitudes", or [...] "Changing Heights"), {{released}} January 1, 1993, {{included the}} song [...] "Ani Af" [...] ("I Fly", or [...] "I am Flying"), {{and what was}} to become an iconic Israeli song, [...] "Tishmor al HaOlam Yeled" [...] ("Watch Over the World, Child", or [...] "Protect Our World, Child"). The latter song was subsequently covered by Liel Kolet and Scorpions' singer Klaus Meine, as well as by Shuly Nathan. The CD consisting mostly of songs composed by D'Or was even more successful than its predecessor and went platinum. Globus reviewed the album and wrote the following: [...] "In an age in which it seems that a good voice is not particularly necessary to be a singer, David D'Or <b>comes</b> <b>along</b> <b>and</b> reminds anyone who had forgotten that not only can things be different, they need to be different. Simply put, D'Or sings beautifully and knows how to choose songs that fit his unique voice...One has to credit him for fulfilling his mission with bravura; his voice on stage sounds as good and convincing as it does in the recording studio. The wide variety of styles that he incorporates in his music, along with his superb vocal ability, allows him to appeal to adults and youths alike." [...] Later in 1993, D'Or participated in the televised competition to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest (Kdam Erovizion), with his song [...] "Parpar," [...] and came in fourth place.|$|E
