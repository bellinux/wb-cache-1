25|$|A dry {{pulverized}} solid, an {{atomized liquid}} fuel or a fuel slurry is gasified with oxygen (much less frequent: air) in <b>co-current</b> flow. The gasification reactions {{take place in}} a dense cloud of very fine particles. Most coals are suitable for this type of gasifier because of the high operating temperatures and because the coal particles are well separated from one another.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to the {{counter-current}} type, but the gasification agent gas {{flows in}} <b>co-current</b> configuration with the fuel (downwards, {{hence the name}} [...] "down draft gasifier"). Heat needs {{to be added to}} the upper part of the bed, either by combusting small amounts of the fuel or from external heat sources. The produced gas leaves the gasifier at a high temperature, and most of this heat is often transferred to the gasification agent added in the top of the bed, resulting in an energy efficiency on level with the counter-current type. Since all tars must pass through a hot bed of char in this configuration, tar levels are much lower than the counter-current type.|$|E
50|$|The hot drying gas can {{be passed}} in as a <b>co-current,</b> same {{direction}} as sprayed liquid atomizer, or counter-current, where the hot air flows against the flow from the atomizer. With <b>co-current</b> flow, particles spend less time {{in the system and}} the particle separator (typically a cyclone device). With counter-current flow, particles spend more time in the system and is usually paired with a fluidized bed system. <b>Co-current</b> flow generally allows the system to operate more efficiently.|$|E

50|$|<b>Co-current</b> {{deionization}} {{refers to}} the original downflow process where both input water and regeneration chemicals enter {{at the top of}} an ion exchange column and exit at the bottom. <b>Co-current</b> operating costs are comparatively higher than counter-current deionization because of the additional usage of regenerants. Because regenerant chemicals are dilute when they encounter the bottom or finishing resins in an ion exchange column, the product quality is lower than a similarly sized counter-flow column.|$|E

50|$|Overall, protein skimmers can be classed in {{two ways}} {{depending}} on whether they operate by <b>co-current</b> flow or counter-current flow. In a <b>co-current</b> flow system, air is introduced {{at the bottom of}} the chamber and is in contact with the water as it rises upwards towards the collection chamber. In a counter-current system, air is forced into the system under pressure and moves against the flow of the water for a while before it rises up towards the collection cup. Because the air bubbles may be in contact with the water for a longer period in a counter-current flow system, protein skimmers of this type are considered by some to be more effective at removing organic wastes.|$|E
50|$|Stripping is a {{physical}} separation process where one or more components are removed from a liquid stream by a vapor stream. In industrial applications the liquid and vapor streams can have <b>co-current</b> or countercurrent flows. Stripping is usually carried out in either a packed or trayed column.|$|E

50|$|These {{contain a}} {{concentric}} internal cylinder. This gathers pre-heated {{air from the}} cooling zone, which is then used to pressurize the middle annular zone of the kiln. Air spreading outward from the pressurized zone causes counter-current flow upwards, and <b>co-current</b> flow downwards. This again produces a long, relatively cool calcining zone. Fuel consumption is in 4 to 4.5 MJ/kg range and the lime is typically medium burned.|$|E

50|$|A loop {{heat pipe}} (LHP) is a passive {{two-phase}} transfer device {{related to the}} heat pipe. It can carry higher power over longer distances by having <b>co-current</b> liquid and vapor flow, {{in contrast to the}} counter-current flow in a heat pipe. This allows the wick in a loop heat pipe to be required only in the evaporator and compensation chamber. Micro loop heat pipes have been developed and successfully employed in a wide sphere of applications both on the ground and in space.|$|E
50|$|On July 1, 2015 <b>co-current</b> {{with the}} Fox {{affiliation}} moving to low-powered WZAW-LD, {{both of the}} Fox-branded newscasts were cancelled after the news share arrangement was terminated. Almost a week later (on July 6), WAOW introduced its own prime time news at 9 (airing weeknights for a half-hour) on its CW digital subchannel. This broadcast, known as Newsline 9 at 9 on The CW, {{can also be seen}} through a simulcast on WMOW's main channel and WYOW-DT2. At some point in fall 2015, WSAW (which is co-owned with WZAW) will launch a new show at 9 on the Fox outlet offering competition in the time slot.|$|E
50|$|A {{trickle-bed reactor}} (TBR) is a {{chemical}} reactor {{that uses the}} downward movement of a liquid and the downward (<b>co-current)</b> or upward (counter-current) movement of gas over a packed bed of (catalyst) particles. It {{is considered to be}} the simplest reactor type for performing catalytic reactions where a gas and liquid (normally both reagents) are present in the reactor and accordingly it is extensively used in processing plants. Typical examples are liquid-phase hydrogenation, hydrodesulfurization, and hydrodenitrogenation in refineries (three phase hydrotreater) and oxidation of harmful chemical compounds in wastewater streams or of cumene in the cumene process.Also in the treatment of waste water trickle bed reactors are used where the required biomass resides on the packed bed surface.|$|E

5000|$|Both of the WFXS newscasts {{maintained}} a separate music package and graphics scheme from WAOW. The broadcasts originated from WAOW's primary set at its studios (on Grand Avenue/U.S. 51 in Wausau) but with unique duratrans indicating the Fox-branded shows. On June 19, 2011, WAOW became the market's second television outlet to upgrade local news to high definition level. Included in {{the change was}} a redesigned set and updated graphics scheme. [...] WFXS did not transition its newscasts to HD until 2012. On July 1, 2015 <b>co-current</b> with the Fox affiliation moving to WZAW, both of the WAOW-produced newscasts were cancelled after the news share arrangement was terminated; WAOW eventually re-launched the newscast within weeks {{at the same time}} on WAOW-DT2 for their CW subchannel.|$|E
50|$|The {{maximum amount}} of heat or mass {{transfer}} that can be obtained is higher with countercurrent than <b>co-current</b> (parallel) exchange because countercurrent maintains a slowly declining difference or gradient (usually temperature or concentration difference). In cocurrent exchange the initial gradient is higher but falls off quickly, leading to wasted potential. For example, in the diagram at the right, the fluid being heated (exiting top) has a higher exiting temperature than the cooled fluid (exiting bottom) that was used for heating. With cocurrent or parallel exchange the heated and cooled fluids can only approach one another. The result is that countercurrent exchange can achieve a greater amount of heat or mass transfer than parallel under otherwise similar conditions. See: flow arrangement.|$|E
50|$|Climbing and falling-film plate {{evaporators}} have {{a relatively}} large surface area. The plates are usually corrugated and are supported by frame. During evaporation, steam flows through the channels formed by the free spaces between the plates. The steam alternately climbs and falls parallel to the concentrated liquid. The steam follows a <b>co-current,</b> counter-current path {{in relation to the}} liquid. The concentrate and the vapor are both fed into the separation stage where the vapor is sent to a condenser. This type of plate evaporator is frequently applied in the dairy and fermentation industries since they have spatial flexibility. A negative point of this type of evaporator is that it is limited in its ability to treat viscous or solid-containing products. There are other types of plate evaporators, which work with only climbing film.|$|E
5000|$|The kiln is a {{cylindrical}} vessel, inclined {{slightly to}} the horizontal, which is rotated slowly about its axis. The material to be processed is fed into {{the upper end of}} the cylinder. As the kiln rotates, material gradually moves down towards the lower end, and may undergo a certain amount of stirring and mixing. Hot gases pass along the kiln, sometimes in the same direction as the process material (<b>co-current),</b> but usually in the opposite direction (counter-current). The hot gases may be generated in an external furnace, or may be generated by a flame inside the kiln. Such a flame is projected from a burner-pipe (or [...] "firing pipe") which acts like a large bunsen burner. The fuel for this may be gas, oil, pulverized petroleum coke or pulverized coal.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of spray dryers are called single effect. There is a single source of drying air {{at the top of the}} chamber (see n°4 on the diagram). In most cases the air is blown in the same {{direction}} as the sprayed liquid (<b>co-current).</b> A fine powder is produced, but it can have poor flow and produce a lot of dust. To overcome the dust and poor flow of the powder, a new generation of spray dryers called multiple effect spray dryers have been produced. Instead of drying the liquid in one stage, drying is done through two steps: the first at the top (as per single effect) and the second with an integrated static bed at the bottom of the chamber. The bed provides a humid environment which causes smaller particles to clump, producing more uniform particle sizes, usually within the range of 100 to 300 µm. These powders are free-flowing due to the larger particle size.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotary dryer}} {{is a type}} of {{industrial}} dryer employed to reduce or minimize the liquid moisture content of the material it is handling by bringing it into direct contact with a heated gas. The dryer is made up of a large, rotating cylindrical tube, usually supported by concrete columns or steel beams. The dryer slopes slightly so that the discharge end is lower than the material feed end in order to convey the material through the dryer under gravity. Material to be dried enters the dryer, and as the dryer rotates, the material is lifted up by a series of internal fins lining the inner wall of the dryer. When the material gets high enough to roll back off the fins, it falls back {{down to the bottom of}} the dryer, passing through the hot gas stream as it falls. This gas stream can either be moving toward the discharge end from the feed end (known as <b>co-current</b> flow), or toward the feed end from the discharge end (known as counter-current flow). The gas stream can be made up of a mixture of air and combustion gases from a burner, in which case the dryer is called a direct heated dryer. Alternatively, the gas stream may consist of air or another (sometimes inert) gas that is preheated. When the gas stream is preheated by some means where burner combustion gases do not enter the dryer, the dryer known as an indirect-heated type. Often, indirect heated dryers are used when product contamination is a concern. In some cases, a combination of direct-indirect heated rotary dryers are also available to improve the overall efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Review of the {{literature}} indicates that imbibition in water-wet matrix blocks is commonly considered to be counter-current. Despite this general belief, our experimental and theoretical studies indicate that <b>co-current</b> imbibition may be the dominant mechanism. Using numerical simulation of the imbibition process {{it is found that}} oil is predominantly recovered by <b>co-current</b> imbibition, and the time for this recovery is only a fraction of that required for counter-current imbibition. This is because in counter-current imbibition, oil is forced to flow in the two-phase region. In <b>co-current</b> imbibition, however, oil is free to flow in the single phase region. This study reveals that <b>co-current</b> imbibition is much more efficient than counter-current imbibition...|$|E
