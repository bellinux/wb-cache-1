5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many factors {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous <b>chronic</b> <b>illnesses,</b> children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E
5|$|Henry went to {{convoluted}} legal {{means to}} justify his succession. Many Lancastrians asserted {{that his mother had}} had legitimate rights through her descent from Edmund Crouchback, who it was claimed was the elder son of Henry III of England, set aside due to deformity. As the great-grandson of Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, was the heir presumptive to Richard II and Henry used multiple rationales stressing his Plantagenet descent, divine grace, powerful friends, and Richard's misgovernment. In fact Mortimer never showed interest in the throne. The later marriage of his sister Anne to Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge consolidated this claim to the throne with that of the more junior House of York. Henry planned to resume war with France, but was plagued with financial problems, declining health and frequent rebellions. He defeated a Scottish invasion, a serious rebellion by Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland in the North and Owain Glyndŵr's rebellion in Wales. Many saw it as a punishment from God when Henry was later struck down with unknown but <b>chronic</b> <b>illnesses.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{self-management}} of <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> at work, as a predictor for self-disclosure. The study reports findings from a survey sent to all staff at a UK university, of which 610 employees reported managing a chronic illness: arthritis, musculoskeletal pain, diabetes, asthma, migraine, heart disease, irritable bowel syndrome and depression. The study found that discrete self-management factors predicted different levels of disclosure: partial self-disclosure (employees informing line managers {{about the presence of}} a <b>chronic</b> <b>illness)</b> and full self-disclosure (employees informing line managers how that <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> affected them at work). For partial disclosure, a greater reported experience of <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> by employees was positively associated with self-disclosure. For full-disclosure, employees {{were more likely to report}} disclosure to line managers if they had already disclosed to colleagues, and if they perceived receiving support from their line managers in relation to their <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> as important. Except for academics who were least likely to disclose, occupational groups did not emerge as significant predictors for either partial or full disclosure. Except for diabetes, <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> itself was not a significant predictor or barrier to self-disclosure.

40|$|Illness {{representations}} {{relating to}} the experience of <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> may directly influence health and illness behaviour (coping methods), as well as having an indirect influence on psychosocial adjustment to <b>chronic</b> <b>illness.</b> <b>Chronic</b> <b>illness</b> is more than a medical condition: it is a subjective experience occurring against a backdrop of individual, social, and cultural influences that impact on the illness experience. The dynamic framework of the Common Sense Model (CSM) of health and illness makes this model particularly useful for understanding health and illness behaviours, including social and cultural factors that impact on these behaviours. The influence of illness representations on health and illness behaviours, and the processes and outcomes relating to psychosocial adjustment to <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> are particularly important when viewed from the perspective of culturally-diverse groups, such as the elderly Greek-speaking male participants in this study. In this thesis, participants’ illness representations and coping methods for their <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> are explored, along with the processes and outcomes associated with their psychosocial adjustment to <b>chronic</b> <b>illness.</b> Semi-structured interviews were conducted and thematic analysis identified themes relevant to the CSM.

40|$|<b>Chronic</b> <b>illness</b> affects {{nearly half}} of all American adults, yet this {{experience}} is often regarded as socially normative for older adults.

Using multilevel modeling of American Changing Lives Survey (ACLS) data, I examined the following questions: What is the relationship between early onset <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> and mastery? Second, {{what is the relationship between}} early onset <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> and depressive symptoms? Does mastery mediate the relationship between early onset <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> and depressive symptoms? Is early onset <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> (24 - 35) more strongly associated with decreased mastery and increased depressive symptoms than illness onset at the more socially normative life stages of mid-life (36 - 64) and late-life (65 years and older) ? Lastly, does mastery mediate or moderate the relationship between timing of illness onset and depressive symptoms? Through this study, I aim to contribute to sociological knowledge of whether and how <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> impacts mastery and depression among young adults. I argue that ill-timed <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> impacts young adults’ sense of control over their lives, which has enduring psychological and social consequences. Findings support that healthy and chronically ill young adults do not significantly differ on mastery, but ill young adults report significantly higher depressive symptoms than healthy same age peers. Mastery moderates the effects of timing of illness onset on depressive symptoms with older adults reaping greater benefit from mastery against depressive symptoms than young adults with early onset illness. These findings suggest that early onset <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> positions people at greater risk for poor mental health outcomes and that the <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> experience and its effects are not uniform across the life course. Consequently, work in this area must consider age as an important context in which the life event of <b>chronic</b> <b>illness</b> onset occurs...|$|R

It is commonly viewed as a phenomenon to be coped with, requiring an adaptive response {{on the part of}} an individual. <b>Chronic</b> <b>illness,</b> however, is a culturally-influenced tool which in itself can be used to organize and implement an adaptive response to personal experience. Employing Hallowell's concept of the self in the behavioral environment, the uses of a <b>chronic</b> folk <b>illness,</b> 'high-pertension', for personal adaptation are discussed. Data from research on health beliefs about hypertension and illness behavior in a sample of 60 older African-American women in New Orleans are presented. 'High-pertension', a <b>chronic</b> folk <b>illness</b> related to the biomedical 'hypertension', and involving blood and 'nerves', is described. Health beliefs and illness behavior associated with high-pertension are considered as part of an individual's total effort at adaptation within the behavioral environment. These points are made: (1) <b>Chronic</b> <b>illness</b> {{can be used as a}} means to express one's self in relation to the behavioral environment. (2) <b>Chronic</b> <b>illness</b> can be used to mamipulate and manage the relation of self to environment. (3) <b>Chronic</b> <b>illness</b> can be used to legitimize and announce role change.
