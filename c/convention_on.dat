5|$|In Europe golden jackals are {{not listed}} under the 1973 <b>Convention</b> <b>on</b> International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora nor the 1979 <b>Convention</b> <b>on</b> the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. Golden jackals in Europe fall under various {{international}} legal instruments. These include the 1979 Berne <b>Convention</b> <b>on</b> the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the 1992 <b>Convention</b> <b>on</b> Biological Diversity, and the 1992 European Union Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Council Directive provides both guidance and limits on what participating governments can do when {{responding to the}} arrival of expanding jackals. These legislative instruments aim to contribute to conserving native wildlife; some governments argue that the golden jackal is not native wildlife but an invading species. The Golden Jackal informal study Group in Europe (GOJAGE) is an organization that is formed by researchers from across Europe to collect and share information on the golden jackal in Europe. The group also has an interest in the golden jackal's relationship with its environment across Eurasia. Membership is open to anyone that has an interest in golden jackals.|$|E
