Studies were conducted on effect of different cylinder speed (5, 6 and 7 m/s), concave clearance (7, 10 and 13 mm), moisture content of okra fruit (12. 3, 15. 8 and 18. 8 % db) and type of extraction drum at a feed rate of 70 kg/h on machine performance and seed quality. Three types of extractor drums namely; <b>square</b> head <b>bolted,</b> rubberized and rasp-bar were used. Seed quality was evaluated for vigour index, dead seed, normal and abnormal germination. The performance of seed extractor was evaluated for its extraction efficiency, cleaning efficiency, seed loss and energy consumption at different crop and machine variables. Extraction efficiency (99. 3 %) caused by <b>square</b> head <b>bolted</b> drum was found highest among all the three extraction mechanisms. Cleaning efficiency {{was found in the}} range of 97. 9 to 99. 6 % for all crop variables. The value of seed loss (4. 7 %) was low with the <b>square</b> head <b>bolted</b> drum in comparison to rasp-bar and rubberized extraction mechanism. The average energy consumption per quintal (100 kg) seed was found to be 1. 9 kWh. It was found that germination and vigour index decreased with increase in pod moisture content. Higher germination was found with <b>square</b> head <b>bolted</b> drum as compared to the rasp-bar and rubberized drum. The germination decreased, whereas dead seed percentage increased with cylinder speed. The best seed quality machine performance was found at 12. 3 percent moisture content (d. b.), 7 mm concave clearance and 5 m/s cylinder speed with the <b>square</b> head <b>bolted</b> drum extraction mechanism...|$|R

Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to study the influences of the geometric parameters on the formability of <b>square</b> <b>cup</b> {{in order to find}} out the optimum setup dimensions of the present process. The effects of die fillet radius, die corner radius, die throat length, punch profile radius; punch corner radius, punch shape factor, relative die clearance and blank thickness on the drawability of <b>square</b> <b>cup</b> were mainly investigated. Cup drawability was also studied with the change of material strain hardening exponent, n, strength coefficient, K, average anisotropy, R, and friction coefficients between die-sheet-punch to find the best operating conditions. The limiting drawing ratio (LDR) was used to evaluate the effects of all these parameters on the <b>square</b> <b>cup</b> drawability. The LDR's, maximum drawing loads, cup thickness, cup height and modes of failure were predicted. The analysis reveals that the determination of the optimum setup dimensions of our developed process has increased the drawing ratio up to 3. 1 for brass alloy (67 / 33 Cu-Zn) and 3. 15 for aluminum (Al 99. 5 w) in a single-drawing stroke. Experiments have been also done in order to compare and verify the FE-predictions. Successful <b>square</b> <b>cups</b> with drawing ratio of 3. 07 for brass and 2. 93 for aluminum were produced.

40|$|This Master of Science thesis {{depicts the}} {{research}} done on geodesic dome structures and tensile bolted bamboo connections. The report includes a parametric structural analysis of bamboo geodesic domes assessing {{the influence of}} openings, local and global stability, geometrical non-linearity, and the maximum possible dome diameters for domes constructed with Guadua angustifolia and Phyllostachys pubescens. The considered load cases are selfweight and a point load {{on top of the}} dome; the latter includes the option of incremental load application and geometrically non-linear analysis. Rules of thumb are derived indicating boundary conditions under which global buckling of half-spherical icosahedron-based geodesic domes does not occur. Furthermore, a comparison of geodesic domes and half-spherical shells is conducted with respect to stability. One of the main challenges in bamboo structures is the design of tensile connectors that exploit bamboo’s tensile strength, avoid splitting, and provide a predictable, ductile failure. In the context of the design and strength prediction of a bolted axial bamboo connector, experiments assessing the dynamic Modulus of Elasticity and compression strength of Guadua angustifolia and Phyllostachys pubescens were conducted. For both properties a significant correlation with density was found. Additionally, the behaviour of bolted connections was simulated by testing the bolt bearing and splitting strength of Phyllostachys pubescens in a single <b>bolt</b> test with <b>square</b> and round <b>bolts.</b> It was found that <b>square</b> <b>bolts</b> result in ductile embedment failure with large displacements. Special focus was paid to the influence of nodes on strength and stiffness; a 3 D scan and electron microscopy of the nodes of Guadua angustifolia and Phyllostachys pubescens were made. Findings from microscopic investigation matched findings from experimental testing: Nodes had a positive influence on embedment and splitting strength and an overall negative effect on full-culm compression strength and compressive Modulus of Elasticity. Last but not least, the insights gained in this research were combined in a case study of a bamboo geodesic dome with elliptical door opening.

Forming of titanium sheet was tried by multistage deep drawing. In the experiment, the material was pure titanium sheets of the JIS grade 2. The initial thickness of the blank was 0. 5 mm in thickness. In the deep drawing process, the sheets were employed and a flat sheet blank is formed into a square by a punch. Various cups were drawn by exchanging the punch and die. The die was taper without a blankholder in the subsequent stages. For the prevention, pure titanium sheets were treated by heat oxide coating. The fresh and clean titanium is not in direct contact with the die during the forming due to the existence of the oxide layer. The effect of the plastic anisotropic on the occurrence of seizure in <b>square</b> <b>cup</b> deep drawing was also examined. The <b>square</b> <b>cups</b> were successfully drawn by heat oxide coating. The coating of titanium sheet has sufficient ability in preventing the seizure in multistage deep drawing operation.

40|$|In this article, a {{new process}} for {{increasing}} the drawability of <b>square</b> <b>cups</b> has been developed. A circular blank is pushed by a flat-headed square punch through a conical die with a square aperture. The deformed blank conforms to the square shape of the die throat and finally a <b>square</b> <b>cup</b> is obtained. The developed technique has a simple tooling set in which the drawing process can be efficiently preformed in a single-acting stroke without using draw beads or blankholder. A commercial finite element simulation package, DYNAFORM, is used to investigate the developed setup {{in order to determine}} the optimum die cone angle. An experimental setup is built accordingly with a half cone angle of 18 degrees. Brass alloy (67 / 33 Cu-Zn) and commercially pure aluminum (Al 99. 5 w) sheets are used in the experimentations. The effects of the original blank thickness (t(0) = 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5, and 3 mm) and the orientation of the blank rolling direction (0 degrees, 22. 5 degrees, 45 degrees, and 67. 5 degrees) to the punch side on the limiting drawing ratio (LDR) and punch load are experimentally investigated. The present process successfully produces <b>square</b> <b>cups</b> with drawing ratios of 2. 92 for brass and 2. 74 for aluminum. The new process has shown superiority over the conventional methods through achieving high drawing ratio especially for thick sheets (2 - 3 mm). Comparison between experimental results and the available published work showed that the required punch force in the new process is significantly reduced while the LDR is increased.
