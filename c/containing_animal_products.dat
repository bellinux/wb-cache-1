In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and New Zealand, bovine tu-berculosis (TB) persists among farmed ruminants because the disease repeatedly spills over from adjacent wildlife species which harbor endemic TB, namely the European badger (Meles meles) in the former two cases and the Australian brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) in the latter case. Bovine TB is also a problem in North America, where wild cervidae are vectors of the disease to livestock (6). Hence, prophylactic vaccination of wild-life reservoir species is being pursued as a disease control strateg...|$|E

40|$|Resistance to the extended-spectrum {{cephalosporins}} {{can occur}} in Salmonella species via the production of extended-spectrum and AmpC β-lactamases. We describe human infections with Salmonella enterica serotype Newport phage type 14 strains resistant to ceftazidime (CAZ) and cefoxitin (FOX) related to the handling of pet treats containing dried beef. These strains were isolated from five patients in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, during 2002 and were compared to a strain cultured from a commercial pet treat present at the property {{of one of the}} patients. The strains were resistant to FOX, CAZ, cefpodoxime, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol; intermediate resistant to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime; and sensitive to the aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and imipenem. Isoelectric focusing, multiplex PCR, and sequencing of the amplicons showed that all strains produced the plasmid-encoded AmpC β-lactamase, CMY- 2. Restriction analysis of plasmid DNA following transformation demonstrated that blaCMY- 2 was encoded on an approximately 140 -kb plasmid. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed the human and pet treat Salmonella strains to be highly related. This study is the first to implicate the transfer of multidrug-resistant Salmonella species through the handling of commercial pet treats <b>containing</b> <b>animal</b> <b>products.</b> In addition to documenting the first cases of human infection caused by CMY- 2 -producing S. enterica serotype Newport strains in Canada, this study illustrates the necessity of rapid and accurate laboratory-based surveillance in the identification of novel types of antimicrobial resistance...|$|E
40|$|I {{critically}} examine Jan Deckers' {{position in}} Animal (De) liberation, where he defends two main views. The first is "qualified moral veganism": Most humans {{have a duty}} to abstain from consuming animal products, even if there are circumstances in which doing so is justified. The author argues, on the one hand, from a pan-sentientist view that attributes sentience to all elementary entities and their compounds. Thus, all living things (such as animals and plants) have a capacity for positive and negative experiences. On the other hand, he develops a consequentialist view that assigns moral agents the unconditional duty to promote their own "holistic health. " This is partly constituted by the agent's "moral health," that is, her acting in a morally justified way. On Deckers' view, moral agents must care for the health of all living entities, give greater weight to the interests of organisms to which they are more closely biologically related, and respect the integrity of nature. Diets <b>containing</b> <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> have a very high negative health impact, because of how they affect the environment, human food security, and the well-being of nonhuman animals. In addition, even though plants are sentient, they are likely less so than animals, and their interests must be given less weight. Therefore, most humans should shift to a vegan diet. Deckers' second proposal is that a qualified ban on the consumption of animal products should be enacted. After discarding other alternative strategies, Deckers defends its feasibility relying on data obtained via a series of surveys. Though the argument partly succeeds in developing a coherent account accommodating the author's intuitions, I conclude that his ontological and normative frameworks remain too underdeveloped, his appeal to biological relatedness has implausible implications, and the methodology he uses in defence of his political position is problematic. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

25|$|An {{argument}} {{proposed by}} Bruce Friedrich, also a protectionist, holds that strict adherence to veganism harms animals, because {{it focuses on}} personal purity, rather than encouraging people to give up whatever <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> they can.
