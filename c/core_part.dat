5|$|Stereotyped and {{repetitive}} motor {{behaviors are}} a <b>core</b> <b>part</b> of {{the diagnosis of}} AS and other ASDs. They include hand movements such as flapping or twisting, and complex whole-body movements. These are typically repeated in longer bursts and look more voluntary or ritualistic than tics, which are usually faster, less rhythmical and less often symmetrical.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a tidal shock, streams of stars can be pulled away from the cluster halo, leaving only the <b>core</b> <b>part</b> of the cluster. These tidal {{interaction}} effects create tails of stars that can extend up to several degrees of arc away from the cluster. These tails typically both precede and follow the cluster along its orbit. The tails can accumulate significant portions of the original mass of the cluster, and can form clumplike features.|$|E
5|$|The notable {{properties}} of germania (GeO2) are its high {{index of refraction}} and its low optical dispersion. These make it especially useful for wide-angle camera lenses, microscopy, and the <b>core</b> <b>part</b> of optical fibers. It has replaced titania as the dopant for silica fiber, eliminating the subsequent heat treatment that made the fibers brittle. At the end of 2002, the fiber optics industry consumed 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this is less than 10% of worldwide consumption. GeSbTe is a phase change material used for its optic properties, such as that used in rewritable DVDs.|$|E

5|$|This {{prompted}} {{the development of}} the Parliamentary Triangle, a <b>core</b> <b>part</b> of Griffin's design, and since then various buildings of national importance were constructed on the lakefront. The Australian National University was built, and sculptures and monuments were built. On average, the population of Canberra increased by more than 50% every five years between 1955 and 1975 as {{the development of the}} capital became more concerted, and new residential land was released through the creation of new town centres in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

Ireland, which {{for many years}} had not {{exploited}} the tourist potential of its castle heritage, began to encourage more tourists in the 1960s and 1970s and Irish castles are now a <b>core</b> <b>part</b> of the Irish tourist industry.

5|$|Tragic {{though they}} were for the Byzantines at the time, the defeat at Anzen and the {{subsequent}} sack of Amorion were militarily of no long-term importance to the Empire, since the Abbasids failed {{to follow up on}} their success. They did, however, {{play a crucial role in}} discrediting iconoclasm, which had always relied on military success to maintain its validity. Shortly after Theophilos's sudden death in 842, the veneration of icons was restored as part of the Triumph of Orthodoxy throughout the Empire. The Battle of Anzen is also notable for illustrating the difficulties faced by the Byzantine military of the time against horse-archers, a remarkable change from the army of the 6th–7th centuries, when such skills formed a <b>core</b> <b>part</b> of Byzantine tactical doctrine. It is also remarkable for being the first confrontation of the middle Byzantine army with the Turkic nomads from Central Asia, whose descendants, the Seljuq Turks, would emerge as Byzantium's major antagonists from the mid-11th century on.|$|E

5|$|When {{speaking}} about why an online game {{was chosen as}} {{the next step in the}} series, Fujisawa cited the intuitive character AI in Dragon Quest IV and party member communication in Dragon Quest VII. Solid ideas for an online game set within the Dragon Quest series were first suggested in 2005, when development was wrapping up on Dragon Quest VIII. It was initially worked on by a very small team, who worked together on the groundwork for some time. A <b>core</b> <b>part</b> of the initial plan was that the game would have a pre-planned ten-year lifespan with continual content updates. Once work had finished on Dragon Quest IX, Dragon Quest X took full priority. During these earlier phases, it was still undecided whether to make the game a mainline title, and there was even doubt as to whether it could be an MMORPG rather than just an online multiplayer game. These doubts, held by Saito, were assuaged by Fujisawa's confidence in the project. Despite this, Fujisawa was a novice at both developing and playing MMORPGs, putting him in stark contrast with other staff members such as Saito, Yoshida and second chief planner Takashi Anzai.|$|E
5|$|While {{cyberpunk}} {{remained a}} <b>core</b> <b>part</b> of the game, the team {{were faced with}} the trouble that no-one really knew what cyberpunk was any more: the most recent game and film references they had were from the early 2000s, as many works {{that might have been}} classed as cyberpunk were now being treated as science fiction. While they could easily have replicated the atmosphere of films like Blade Runner, the team wanted to create something original within the genre. Something that concerned the team was about portraying the world of Human Revolution in relation to the original Deus Ex, which chronologically took place 25 years later: while the original Deus Ex used technological elements common {{at the time it was}} made such as 4:3 aspect ratio monitors and landline telephones, Human Revolution used mobiles and wide-screen televisions. According to Jacques-Belletête, this separation was ultimately put down to the differing portrayals of the world between the two games: while Deus Ex was set in poor communities and focused on the social impact of new technology, Human Revolution focused on the high end of society and technology's physical impact.|$|E
