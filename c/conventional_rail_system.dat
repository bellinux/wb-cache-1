50|$|Russia {{worked on}} a system similar to the Bennie Railplane in the 1930s and were even {{planning}} a 332-mile line through Turkestan with {{a top speed of}} 180 mph. Their system was unique in that it had two side by side cars suspended on one rail, and it could actually dismount from the rail to cross rivers as an amphibian and then on the other side remount the rail. And while elements of this system were tested in Moscow, the Russian government instead built a <b>conventional</b> <b>rail</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{need for}} a system like ETCS stems from more and longer running trains {{resulting}} from economic integration of the European Union (EU) and the liberalisation of national railway markets. At {{the beginning of the}} 1990s were some national high speed train projects supported by EU without interoperability of trains. This catalysed the Directive 1996/48 about the interoperability of high-speed trains, followed by Directive 2001/16 extending the concept of interoperability to the <b>conventional</b> <b>rail</b> <b>system.</b> ETCS specifications have become part of, or are referred to, the Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) for (railway) control-command systems. So it is a piece of European legislation managed by the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA). It is a legal requirement that all new, upgraded or renewed tracks and rolling stock in the European railway system should adopt ETCS, possibly keeping legacy systems for backward compatibility. Many networks outside the EU have also adopted ETCS, generally for high-speed rail projects.|$|E

The Disneyland Monorail System in California is notable for being the first monorail system {{to operate in the}} United States, while the Walt Disney World Monorail System in Florida, with an estimated 150,000 passengers each day, is one of the busiest monorail systems in the world. Both Disney park resort properties in the United States, as well as those in Japan and France, contain theme parks that feature genuine steam-powered railroads. The Disney park chain has one of the world's largest private collections of operational steam locomotives, with seventeen in total spread across the globe. Additional rail systems within the theme parks in both United States resorts and the Hong Kong resort resemble steam-powered railroads, but their locomotives are powered by internal combustion engines. Other rail transport modes found in Disney parks include horse-drawn streetcar rail lines in the parks within both resorts in the United States and the resort in France, as well as replica vintage electric rail lines in the parks in California and Japan.|$|E

30|$|In 2004, the European Commission {{produced}} Railway Safety Directive 49 / 2004 /EC [3], {{in order}} to define Common Safety Targets (CSTs) and to improve, where possible, system safety levels. The Directive stipulates that Member States are duty-bound to conduct an independent investigation {{in order to}} improve rail safety and prevent accidents. In addition to serious accidents, the investigating body may conduct investigations into accidents and incidents which, under slightly different circumstances, could have resulted in more serious accidents, including technical failures in structural rail sub-sections or interoperability components of the trans-European high-speed or <b>conventional</b> <b>rail</b> <b>systems.</b> The Railway Safety Directive 49 / 2004 /EC requires the safety of railway transport to be defined according to acceptable individual risks to LX users (Article 7, § 4 a) [3]. The Directive expects the development of procedures and methods for risk evaluation and assessment (Article 6, § 3 a). The CSTs define safety levels that must at least be reached in each Member State by different parts of the railway system and by the system as a whole. These CSTs are expressed as risk acceptance criteria for individual risks (passengers, maintenance staff including subcontractors, LX users and others, and unauthorized persons) and societal risks.|$|R

50|$|SRTC and STA jointly {{created the}} Light Rail Steering Committee (LRSC) which was {{responsible}} for studying {{the creation of a}} light rail corridor from downtown Spokane to Liberty Lake. This effort, beginning in 2000, was preceded by significant study by the SRTC. In 2006 the committee published a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) which evaluated several rail and bus alternatives for the corridor. The committee stated preference for a single-track rail corridor using diesel multiple units (DMU) that would cost less than half the <b>conventional</b> light <b>rail</b> <b>system.</b> The travel demand modeling performed as part of the DEIS forecast less than 3,500 daily boardings on the 15.5-mile system in 2025. As a comparison, the 19-mile TRAX light <b>rail</b> <b>system</b> in Salt Lake City has over 43,000 daily boardings. An advisory vote in 2006 elicited a negative response to continued planning and investment in the light rail project.|$|R
40|$|Air and <b>rail</b> {{transportation}} <b>systems</b> {{are characterized}} by important common features: they serve a significant share of passenger traffic in Eu-rope; their functioning relies on the cooperation of many stakeholders op-erating a fixed timetable, often with competing objectives; {{and they have been}} characterized by quite a fragmented development following national borders. For these systems, the European Commission envisages a com-mon future in terms of an increase of efficiency and elimination of national borders. In this paper, we analyze the two systems in the perspective of their common development and we underline the main existing differences linked to the management of the infrastructure. These differences concern the processes implemented for specifying and allocating capacity, both in strategic planning and in real-time intervention. Our analysis suggests that the air transportation system is moving in the direction indicated by the European Commission, as well as the <b>rail</b> transportation <b>system</b> for what concerns international train paths (typically high-speed trains). However, a substantial separation still exists between <b>conventional</b> <b>rail</b> transportation <b>systems</b> of different countries. ∗Corresponding author 1 ha l-...|$|R

40|$|China {{has built}} the world’s longest network of High Speed <b>Rail</b> (HSR) <b>systems</b> {{in less than}} 5 years. However, {{there are very few}} studies on the life cycle impact of China’s HSR systems {{compared}} to studies around the world. Environmental impacts of China’s HSR could be very significant due to dependence on dirty coal-fired power and material and energy intensive bridges. Thus, a life cycle assessment of China’s HSR systems is necessary. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to investigate environmental impacts of China’s HSR system between Beijing and Shanghai, assessing life cycle stages including: (1) vehicle manufacture, maintenance, and disposal; (2) infrastructure construction; (3) operation. Data from Chinese Ministry of Railway, Ecoinvent database, and Chinese Core Life Cycle Database (CLCD), are compiled to build the HSR’s life cycle inventory. LCA software eBalance is used to conduct the analysis. Additional scenarios are developed by varying infrastructure composition, electricity mix, HSR development, travel length of cross-line vehicles, vehicle utilization, occupancy rate, and use of fly ash in concrete, in order to help identify major drivers of environmental impact and propose recommendations for improvement. It is discovered that operation stage contributes to 72 - 91 % of the impacts in Acidification Potential (AP), Primary Energy Demand (PED), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Global Warming Potential (GWP), and Respiratory Inorganics (RI). Vehicle stage contributes to 43 % of impact in Chinese Abiotic Depletion Potential (CADP). Infrastructure construction accounts for 54 % of impact in Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and 38 % of impact in CADP. Scenario analysis identified several key drivers of impact, including proportion of bridge, tunnel, and reinforced subgrade, electricity mix, various factors that lead to different demands of HSR vehicle and transportation, and fly ash use in concrete. Several suggestions are proposed to improve life cycle environmental performance of HSR projects. It is also discovered that China’s HSR systems have higher impact in RI than Germany’s HSR and <b>conventional</b> <b>rail</b> <b>systems,</b> and lower impact in RI than Switzerland’s road and air systems...|$|R
2500|$|A {{test system}} in Toronto {{was the primary}} concern. With the GO-Urban concept having since been cancelled, and GO Transit having turned to <b>conventional</b> heavy <b>rail</b> <b>systems,</b> the only {{suitable}} local market was the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The TTC had recently extended the east-west Bloor-Danforth subway line {{with the addition of}} another station on each end of the line, and had planned to further extend the line with streetcars running from those stations into the suburbs. Construction had already started on the streetcar system at the eastern end of the line at Kennedy station when the provincial government asked them to switch to the ICTS. The TTC was uninterested until the government threatened to pull their financing, which accounted for 75% of the capital budget. In exchange, the government agreed to pay for any cost overruns above the original streetcar budget. Construction of the internal streetcar platform and a turn-around loop had already been completed at the station. The platform had to be raised to the higher floor height of the ICTS, but UTDC claimed the vehicle would be able to make its way around the [...] radius loop at [...] without additional modification.|$|R

40|$|In Germany {{the demand}} for altnerative {{operation}} concepts to <b>conventional</b> <b>rail</b> and tram <b>systems</b> has increased due to regionalisation of the regional rail traffic. The light <b>rail</b> <b>system</b> (LRT) {{of the city of}} Karlsruhe and the developing of railbuses {{in the last few years}} show that there is a substantial developing potential for the next years. Especially the success of the LRT system of Karlsruhe causes that a few cities have already ordered experties. In the meantime a second system gets ready (Kassel) and a third system (Saarbruecken) will start at the end of this year. The topic of this thesis was firstly to show the technical possibilities, and secondly to develop a method that requires less time to find the appropriate transportation system for a region. The first part of the thesis treats the current legal margin conditions and also the existing operation degrees that allows the flexible use of different vehicle concepts. As well the thesis depicts and compares the technical possibilities and the current vehicle concepts. In the second part a planning process will be developed, that allows to make a statement, with only a few input datas, which transportation system is the most convenient for the region. For this different assessment citerias will be developed which allows to assess and to categorize transportation systems. These criterias would be controlled on the basis of rail lines taken as examples. Furthermore, in order to facilitate a first rough estimation som 'soft' criterias like the density of the rail network will be determined with the help of statistical studies. These criterias will be integrated in the planning process. In conclusion the planning process will be tested in the Greater Hannover Area. A service concept will be developed to coordinate the existing LRT-system and the rapid <b>rail</b> <b>system</b> (RRT). For this a regional LRT (Interurban) will be developed that operates on the weak regional rail lines and in the inner city on the existing LRT lines. The completed assessment shows that such a combined public transport system is better than a separated system (RRT/LRT) for the Greater Hannover Area, because the weaker regional rail lines are better connected with the central businness district and the level and quality of service is better adapted to the need of the rural area.
