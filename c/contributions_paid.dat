25|$|Robert M. Ball, {{a former}} {{commissioner}} of Social Security under President Kennedy in 1961 (and later under Johnson, and Nixon) defined the {{major obstacle to}} financing health insurance for the elderly: {{the high cost of}} care for the aged combined with the generally low incomes of retired people. Because retired older people use much more medical care than younger employed people, an insurance premium related to the risk for older people needed to be high, but if the high premium had to be paid after retirement, when incomes are low, it was an almost impossible burden for the average person. The only feasible approach, he said, was to finance health insurance {{in the same way as}} cash benefits for retirement, by <b>contributions</b> <b>paid</b> while at work, when the payments are least burdensome, with the protection furnished in retirement without further payment. In the early 1960s relatively few of the elderly had health insurance, and what they had was usually inadequate. Insurers such as Blue Cross, which had originally applied the principle of community rating, faced competition from other commercial insurers that did not community rate, and so were forced to raise their rates for the elderly.|$|E
60|$|Now as to {{the basis}} of contribution, which also is a {{principle}} admitted first {{to operate in the}} assembly of the commune. Let us again take one canton, such as is stated above. If the whole of the direct <b>contributions</b> <b>paid</b> by a great trading or manufacturing town be divided equally among the inhabitants, each individual will be found to pay much more than an individual living in the country according to the same average. The whole paid by the inhabitants of the former will be more than the whole paid by the inhabitants of the latter,--we may fairly assume one third more. Then the 12,700 inhabitants, or 2,193 voters of the canton, will pay as much as 19,050 inhabitants, or 3,289 voters of the other cantons, which are nearly the estimated proportion of inhabitants and voters of five other cantons. Now the 2,193 voters will, as I before said, send only ten deputies to the assembly; the 3,289 voters will send sixteen. Thus, for an equal share in the contribution of the whole commune, there will be a difference of sixteen voices to ten in voting for deputies to be chosen on the principle of representing the general contribution of the whole commune.|$|E

40|$|The {{invaluable}} {{social and}} economic contribution that women collectively make is often undervalued and underestimated. This paper attempts to address this to some extent, by providing a contemporary assessment of women’s <b>contribution</b> to <b>paid</b> off-farm work in rural and agricultural communities in Australia. As part of the analysis, women’s <b>contributions</b> to <b>paid</b> off-farm work activities are examined. Measures of the contribution of women {{in terms of their}} <b>contribution</b> to <b>paid</b> off-farm work are calculated using values derived from specially constructed models. A brief literature review of relevant research concerning the determinants of women’s <b>contribution</b> to <b>paid</b> off-farm work in the agricultural and rural communities is also incorporated. The findings presented are thus largely based on current research, with one of the main goals of the exercise being to provide more complete information regarding the contribution of women to agricultural and rural communities, to improve future policy development and implementation in relevant areas...|$|R

In most municipalities, the income tax comes to approximately 30 percent, with the two higher income brackets paying a total of 50 or 55 percent respectively. The combination of the two types is a total tax effect of 47 to 66 percent.|$|R
