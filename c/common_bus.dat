2500|$|The {{initially}} developed reciprocating {{steam engine}} {{has been used}} to produce mechanical power since the 18th Century, with notable improvements being made by James Watt. [...] When the first commercially developed central electrical power stations were established in 1882 at Pearl Street Station in New York and Holborn Viaduct power station in London, reciprocating steam engines were used. [...] The development of the steam turbine in 1884 provided larger and more efficient machine designs for central generating stations. [...] By 1892 the turbine was considered a better alternative to reciprocating engines; turbines offered higher speeds, more compact machinery, and stable speed regulation allowing for parallel synchronous operation of generators on a <b>common</b> <b>bus.</b> After about 1905, turbines entirely replaced reciprocating engines in large central power stations.|$|E

[...] The German Patent and Trade Mark Office in Munich granted the air/water-brine/water heat pump a patent in 2008, under the title “Heat pump and method for controlling the source inlet temperature to the heat pump”. This hybrid heat pump can be combined with a solar thermal system or with an ice-storage. [...] It trades and is marketed under the name ThermSelect.

5000|$|The {{power factor}} of {{induction}} motors varies with load, typically from around 0.85 or 0.90 {{at full load}} to as low as about 0.20 at no-load, due to stator and rotor leakage and magnetizing reactances. Power factor can be improved by connecting capacitors either on an individual motor basis or, by preference, on a <b>common</b> <b>bus</b> covering several motors. For economic and other considerations, power systems are rarely power factor corrected to unity power factor.Power capacitor application with harmonic currents requires power system analysis to avoid harmonic resonance between capacitors and transformer and circuit reactances.

40|$|An Electrical Heave Compensation System {{will cause}} large power demand {{fluctuations}} with a period time e. g. of around 8 to 12 seconds. These large power fluctuations are not desirable for {{the stability of}} the ship’s electrical power grid. This paper proposes the application and control of a supercapacitor based ESS in a power electronic system with a <b>common</b> DC <b>Bus</b> to limit the effect of the power fluctuations on the ship’s electrical power grid. The regenerated power from the heave compensation movements is temporarily stored in supercapacitors and used again when power is demanded. This causes a more constant power flow from the ship’s electrical power grid, which will cope with the losses in the system. Two topologies are discussed, namely the direct connection of the supercapacitors to the <b>common</b> DC <b>bus</b> and the indirect connection of the supercapacitors to the <b>common</b> DC <b>bus</b> through a DCDC converter. The result of the modelling and experiments of both ESS topologies shows that the high power fluctuations caused by an electrical heave compensation system are significantly decreased...|$|R
