We argue that adjunct extraposition is itself derivationally ambiguous, and may be derived either by movement of the adjunct or by base-generation of the adjunct in extraposed position. Accordingly, we argue for a relaxation of the strictly compositional view that nominal modification is always mediated by syntactic sisterhood.

40|$|Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is {{developing}} vitrified waste forms for plutonium-bearing ash and plutonium-bearing sand, slag, and crucible (SS&C) materials from Rocky Flats. Waste forms are to meet product criteria (e. g., safeguard termination limits, storage criteria, and target plutonium loading) and processing constraints (e. g., upper temperature limits, processing time, and equipment compatibility). The target waste form for ash is an agglomerated product, while that for SS&C is a fully encapsulated product. Laboratory scoping studies {{were conducted on}} glass formulations from six different glass families: (1) antimony vanadium phosphate, (2) iron vanadium phosphate, (3) tin zinc phosphate, (4) soda-lime silicate, (5) alkali borosilicate, and (6) alkali borate. Glass families were selected due to viscosity behavior in the temperature range of interest (< 800 <b>C).</b> <b>Scoping</b> study tests included gradient furnace tests to determine processing range and sintering temperature, thermogravimetric analysis to determine weight loss {{as a function of}} temperature, and crucible tests to determine frit compositions tolerance to variations in processing temperature, waste loading, and waste type. The primary screening criterion for the selection of frits for future studies was processing temperature below 400 C to minimize the potential for foaming in ash caused by the release of gases (main source of gas is combustion of carbon species) and to minimize processing cycle times. Based on this criterion, glass formulations from the tin zinc phosphate and alkali borosilicate families were selected for future variability testing. Variability testing will include final product evaluation, glass system tolerance to waste loading and composition variation, and identification of parameters impacting time/temperature profiles.

40|$|Abstract Issues of {{environment}} {{and environmental health}} involve multiple interests regarding e. g. political, societal, economical, and public concerns represented by different kinds of organizations and individuals. Not surprisingly, stakeholder and public participation {{has become a major}} issue in environmental and environmental health policy and assessment. The need for participation has been discussed and reasoned by many, including environmental legislators around the world. In principle, participation is generally considered as desirable and the focus of most scholars and practitioners is on carrying out participation, and making participation more effective. In practice also doubts regarding the effectiveness and importance of participation exist among policy makers, assessors, and public, leading even to undermining participatory practices in policy making and assessment. There are many possible purposes for participation, and different possible models of interaction between assessment and policy. A solid conceptual understanding of the interrelations between participation, assessment, and policy making is necessary in order to design and implement effective participatory practices. In this paper we ask, do current common conceptions of assessment, policy making and participation provide a sufficient framework for achieving effective participation? This question is addresses by reviewing the range of approaches to participation in assessment and policy making upon issues {{of environment}} and environmental health and some related insights from recent research projects, INTARESE and BENERIS. Openness, considered e. g. in terms of a) scope of participation, b) access to information, <b>c)</b> <b>scope</b> of contribution, d) timing of openness, and e) impact of contribution, provides a new perspective to the relationships between participation, assessment and policy making. Participation, assessment, and policy making form an inherently intertwined complex with interrelated objectives and outcomes. Based on experiences from implementing openness, we suggest complete openness as the new default, deviation from which should be explicitly argued, in assessment and policy making upon issues of environment and environmental health. Openness does not undermine the existing participatory models and techniques, but provides conceptual means for their more effective application, and opens up avenues for developing new kinds of effective participatory practices that aim for societal development through collaborative creation of knowledge. </p...|$|E

This dissertation used content analysis to investigate the current status of the Master of Fine Arts degree. It followed up the original 1965 study by Weller et al. entitled The Present Status of the M. F. A. Degree. Printed or electronic catalogues from the 204 M. F. A. -granting institutions were reviewed, and data were collected within three sample groups: independent (22), private (44), and public (138). The findings were compared to answer two research questions: (1) what are the dominant characteristics and artistic and educational philosophies of public, private, and independent M. F. A. programs? and (2) what are the similarities and differences among the three types of M. F. A. programs in their (a) objectives, (b) degree requirements, (<b>c)</b> <b>scope,</b> and (d) graduates' career tracks?The findings showed that the curricula of the majority of M. F. A. programs follow the standards provided by the College Art Association. Several changes have occurred since Weller's report. They include: (1) the increasing number of institutions and students; (2) the shift of career objectives from preparation for college teachers to preparation for professional artists; and (3) the increasing number of institutions offering studies in design/applied arts, media arts, and new genres. The findings also showed that independent institutions have a higher average number of graduates who are both college teachers and professional artists than do private or public institutions. Nevertheless, more public institutions produce graduates who are college teachers or artists because there are more public institutions than independent and private ones. Both independent and private programs are more flexible than public ones in providing new areas of studies in their M. F. A. curriculum. The leading programs with most graduates who are college teachers or professional artists are independent art schools (21) and university-based art schools (39) in both private and public institutions. This dissertation provides a timeline documenting events related to the visual arts in higher education, American higher education, and the history of the visual arts. The findings of this study bridge the history of graduate studio arts education between 1965 and the present and form the foundation for investigating the future of M. F. A. education...|$|E

Children's interpretation of disjunction in negative sentences: {{a comparison of}} Turkish and German [...] 5. Acquisition of scope relations by Turkish-English bilingual children [...] 6. Conclusion. This dissertation investigated the scope relations assigned by English-, German- and Turkish-speaking monolingual and bilingual children. Across languages, disjunction is assigned different interpretations in negative sentences and in sentences with the temporal term before. For instance, the English (and German) sentence A did not eat B or C licenses the ‘conjunctive’ interpretation that A did not eat B and did not eat C. On this interpretation, negation takes scope over disjunction (NOT > OR). In adult Turkish, if the disjunction phrase is marked with accusative case, then disjunction takes scope over negation (OR > NEG), yielding the ‘disjunctive’ interpretation that A either did not eat B or did not eat <b>C.</b> <b>Scope</b> relations between disjunction and the temporal term before also differ across languages. In English (and German), the sentence A reached the finish line before B or C requires A to reach the finish line before both B and C. In Turkish, the corresponding sentences are true in this circumstance, and also in other circumstances. Adopting a learnability principle called the Semantic Subset Principle, the experimental hypothesis was that children, across languages, would initially adopt the strongest (subset) interpretation of both kinds of sentences, in order to guarantee language learnability regardless of the scope assignments preferred by adults. These predictions were evaluated in three experiments using the Truth Value Judgment Task, testing monolingual children acquiring German, English, and Turkish, and Turkish-English bilingual children. On the proposed account, both groups of Turkish-speaking children were expected to initially assign interpretations that do not match those of the adults, whereas the interpretations assigned by German- and English-speaking children were expected to match those of adults. As predicted, both monolingual and bilingual children were found to initially assign a strong subset reading to disjunction in all three languages, both when disjunction appeared in the scope of negation and when it appeared in {{the scope of the}} temporal term before. This meant that the interpretations assigned by Turkish-speaking children differed from those of adults. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (ix, 182 pages...|$|E

50|$|A subtle {{issue is}} exactly when a scope begins and ends. In some languages, {{such as in}} <b>C,</b> a <b>scope</b> starts at declaration, and thus {{different}} names declared within a given block can have different scopes. This requires declaring functions before use, though not necessarily defining them, and requires forward declaration in some cases, notably for mutual recursion. In other languages, such as JavaScript or Python, a name's scope begins {{at the start of}} the relevant block (such as the start of a function), regardless of where it is defined, and all names within a given block have the same scope; in JavaScript this is known as variable hoisting. However, when the name is bound to a value varies, and behavior of in-context names that have undefined value differs: in Python use of undefined variables yields a runtime error, while in JavaScript undefined variables are usable (with undefined value), but function declarations are also hoisted to the top of the containing function and usable throughout the function.|$|R
