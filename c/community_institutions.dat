25|$|In 1873 {{he was one}} of {{the founders}} of Mea Shearim, whose name he coined.

In each neighborhood he supervised the purchase and construction of homes and assisted home buyers in acquiring loans. He also helped establish <b>community</b> <b>institutions</b> and spoke in the local synagogue.

25|$|One of {{the main}} sources of income of the Jewish {{population}} of the town was from the manufacture of clothing that was sold throughout Russia. They also made furniture and various agricultural tools. From the late 18th century to the First World War, the Russian government confined Jews to living within the Pale of Settlement, which included modern Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia, almost exactly corresponding to {{the territory of the}} Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth recently taken over by Imperial Russia. This caused the creation of Jewish market-villages (shtetls) throughout today's Eastern Europe, with their own markets, schools, hospitals, and other <b>community</b> <b>institutions.</b>|$|E

Gen.

Porter Military Academy later joined with Gaud School and is now a university-preparatory school, Porter-Gaud School.|$|E
25|$|Like the Irish and Italian, the Jewish {{community}} has {{played an important}} role in recent New York City politics; Jewish voters traditionally vote in large numbers and have often supported politically liberal policies. As the proportion of liberal Conservative and Reform Jews decreases and that of conservative Russian and Orthodox Jews increases in the 21st Century the political interests of New York Jews are changing. The Russian immigrants have shown a tendency to vote Republican while the ultra-orthodox are social conservatives who have a pressing need for supportive social services. There is little support among either group for the liberal <b>community</b> <b>institutions</b> which have been built by the liberal Jewish community. A significant portion of the rapidly growing Hasidic community is pro-Israel and supports the Israeli Settlement Movement.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle had {{not been}} {{instrumental}} in setting up the new organization and, from the start, he opposed efforts by fellow EEC member countries to move toward some form of political integration that, in de Gaulle's thinking, would impinge on the sovereignty of France, both internally and externally. To counter those supranational tendencies that he disparaged, he put forward in 1961 the so-called Fouchet Plan that maintained all decision-making powers {{in the hands of}} governments, reducing the projected European parliamentary assembly to a mere consultative assembly. As expected, the plan was rejected by France's partners. In July 1965 de Gaulle provoked a major six-month crisis when he ordered the boycott of EEC institutions (see Empty chair crisis below) until his demands – the withdrawal of a European Commission proposal to reinforce the <b>community</b> <b>institutions</b> to the detriment of national sovereignty, and the acceptance of France's proposal regarding the financing of the newly established Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) – were met with the Luxembourg compromise.|$|E
