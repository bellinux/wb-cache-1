2500|$|Beyond its seeming {{cultivation}} of German philosophy, Poor Dionis is stylistically {{an homage to}} German Romanticism. It is most closely related to late-18th-century fantasy works by E. T. A. Hoffmann or Novalis. Among the Eminescu scholars, Perpessicius, Philippide, Simion and Constantin Ciopraga see a special connection between Dionis and Heinrich von Ofterdingen, the [...] "Blue Flower" [...] minstrel of Novalis' prose. In addition to this floral motif, Eminescu takes from Novalis the whole narrative device of dream sequences, and the uchronic worldview of [...] "magical idealism". From Adelbert von Chamisso, the Romanian writer borrowed a [...] "man without a shadow" [...] motif that had already inspired him to write the 1869 short story [...] "My Shadow". Eminescu's <b>characterology</b> is described by several authors as a nod {{in the direction of}} J. W. Goethe and his Faust, which also tells the story of an ill-adjusted savant reclaiming the universe.|$|E

40|$|The essay traces how, {{possibly}} in partial {{response to the}} national <b>characterologies</b> of Arthur Griffith and Otto Weininger, James Joyce made symbolic use of the Hungarian language in his mature fictional books Ulysses (1922) and Finnegans Wake (1939). Taking its clues from the Biblical narratives {{of the fall of}} man and the fall of the tower of Babel, the study argues that this Finno-Ugric language, radically different from most European idioms and possessing a seemingly impenetrable vocabulary, grammar and orthography, became a useful device in Joyce’s hands to reinforce his major themes of (postlapsarian) carnality and linguistic confusion in his later fiction...|$|R
40|$|I {{argue that}} {{technological}} determinism {{is one of}} the most important philosophical theories of technology and thus should be studied in length. Traditionally technological determinism is conceived as a doctrine included by technological autonomy or vice versa. However, we should make a distinction between these two claims about technology; I defend a specific version of technological determinism but reject technological autonomy. The question of technological determinism is whether technology {{is one of the}} prime movers of society or not. To get a clear picture of the concept of technological impact, we should look into a general philosophical discussion of determinism. The traditional metaphor of determinism has been a Laplacean determinism which sees the world as great clockwork which makes it possible to predict any future state from the sufficient knowledge of present state. This makes free will impossible. However, we may take a compatibilist view on determinism, and maintain that things are both caused and still humans have free will. In relation to technological determinism this means that there is no contradiction in saying that technology changes culture, but we may still have some powers to influence technology. Our idea of technology also affects our understanding of technological determinism. That is why I explicate Jacques Ellul’s theory of <b>characterologies</b> of technology and criticize them by using Andrew Feenberg’s theory of instrumentalisation. Thus I hope to reach a coherent view of essential features of technology which I shall call modified technological essentialism. Traditional understanding of technological determinism has overemphasized the role of instrumental rationality as a threat to traditional human values. Although technology may diminish some old values it necessarily creates new ones. This is why the characterisation of technology is so important for our understanding of technological determinism; the question whether technology is neutral or value-laden determines our understanding of technology’s impact on society. From this viewpoint technological voluntarism, belief that technology is essentially neutral collection of instruments to whatever ends we may pursue, is the directly opposite view on technological determinism.

50|$|Nearly half {{a century}} after Galton first {{investigated}} the lexical hypothesis, Franziska Baumgarten published the first psycholexical classification of personality-descriptive terms. Using dictionaries and <b>characterology</b> publications, Baumgarten identified 1,093 separate terms in the German language used {{in the description of}} personality and mental states. Although this figure is similar in size to the German and English estimates offered by earlier researchers, Gordon Allport and Henry S. Odbert revealed this to be a severe underestimate in a 1936 study. Similar to the earlier work of M. L. Perkins, they used Webster's New International Dictionary as their source. From this list of approximately 400,000 words, Allport and Odbert identified 17,953 unique terms used to describe personality or behavior.|$|E
50|$|Bouts, a Roman Catholic priest, {{became the}} main {{promoter}} of renewed 20th-century interest in phrenology and psychognomy in Belgium. He was also active in Brazil and Canada, where he founded institutes for <b>characterology.</b> His works Psychognomie and Les Grandioses Destinées individuelle et humaine dans la lumière de la Caractérologie et de l'Evolution cérébro-cranienne are considered standard {{works in the}} field. In the latter work, which examines the subject of paleoanthropology, Bouts developed a teleological and orthogenetical view on a perfecting evolution, from the paleo-encephalical skull shapes of prehistoric man, which he considered still prevalent in criminals and savages, towards a higher form of mankind, thus perpetuating phrenology's problematic racializing of the human frame. Bouts died on March 7, 1999. His work has been continued by the Dutch foundation PPP (Per Pulchritudinem in Pulchritudine), operated by Anette Müller, one of Bouts' students.|$|E
50|$|This characterological {{element of}} Bahnsen’s teachings, {{on which the}} works of such {{philosophers}} as Ludwig Klages are build upon, is laid down in the Contributions to <b>Characterology</b> (1867) {{as well as the}} disquisitions On the Relationship Between Will and Motive (1870) and Mosaics and Silhouettes (1877). Since the nature of unreasonableness consists in contradiction—particularly the contemporaneous existence of multiple will directions attaching themselves to each other—it follows that not only reality is a continuous struggle of material contrasts (real-dialectic), but that the inside of each individual is addicted to the insolvable antagonism of opposite will directions (will collisions) as well. Bahnsen negates a redemption of the countless will units (“will henades”, as he expresses it himself) and postulates the permanence of the existence of the contradiction as a basic nature of the world, whereby the law of this world becomes a tragic world order.|$|E

40|$|A {{paper on}} <b>Characterology</b> needs some apology, I fear, {{if it is}} to be read to a Statistical and Social Inquiry Society such as this. No doubt characterologists are not in quite as unenviable a {{position}} as palmists, clairvoyants or spiritualists.

But that is not because practical <b>characterology</b> is regarded as worthy of very serious consideration?though not a few people imagine themselves to be fairly good amateur characterologists? but only because it is not regarded as mischievous, and so not worth considering at all. In the public mind charaeterologists are supposed to stand in much the same relation to psychologists as homeopathists, herbists and bone-setters stand to those whose names are to be found on the Medical Register. The object of this paper is to consider if <b>characterology</b> does not deserve some measure of definite recognition, and if it appears to do so, to offer some suggestions as to the statistical methods that should be employed as the basis of characterological research...|$|E
40|$|The article {{maintains}} that the knowledge of <b>characterology</b> allows the educator to utilise a young person’s natural tendencies so as to orientate a full development as persons.

He gave as an example the fact that “ … Modern English shows a characteristic tendency for the thematical conception of the subject” [ibid: 61] – that is, for mapping the Subject on to the Theme of a clause rather than on to the Actor.
