5|$|The Hungarian mythographer Karl Kerényi, one of {{the founders}} of the modern study of Greek mythology, wrote about Orion in Gods of the Greeks (1951). Kerényi portrays Orion as a giant of Titanic vigor and <b>criminality,</b> born outside his mother as were Tityos or Dionysus. Kerényi places great stress on the variant in which Merope is the wife of Oenopion. He sees this as the remnant of a lost form of the myth in which Merope was Orion's mother (converted by later generations to his {{stepmother}} and then to the present forms). Orion's blinding is therefore parallel to that of Aegypius and Oedipus.|$|E
5|$|To {{suggest that}} the BBC, forming opinion {{in the minds of}} the people of England, has been an {{influence}} for good in any way, when you consider the <b>criminality</b> of large areas of London; when you consider the Mods and Rockers, and all those other things; when you consider the total moral underminings which have been taking place in England, much to all our distress, in the last fifteen to twenty years, the Hon. Member can hardly bring that up as an argument in favour of the freedom of broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|By the Han dynasty, {{written law}} had matured from its archaic form {{based largely on}} natural law and social customs into a {{rational}} corpus influenced by politics and based on positive law. However, the Han dynasty law code established by Chancellor Xiao He (d. 193 BCE) was largely an extension of an existing Qin dynasty law code. Evidence for this includes archaeological finds at Qin-era Shuihudi and Han-era Zhangjiashan. The nine chapters of the law code consisted of statutes which dealt with <b>criminality,</b> while two of these chapters dealt with court procedure. Although it survives only in small fragments, it was allegedly a massive written work on 960 written scrolls. The code had 26,272 articles written in 7,732,200 words that outlined punishments. There were 490 articles {{on the death penalty}} alone which contained 1,882 offenses and 3,472 analogies or pieces of case law.|$|E
5|$|Given that {{firearms}} possession {{was banned}} during German Nazi occupation and then allowed {{only to those}} deemed loyal during the Communist regime, {{the right to be}} armed is seen as one of attributes of liberty in the country. Together with rapid rise of <b>criminality</b> involving illegal firearms following the Velvet Revolution, this led to fast rise in legal firearms ownership in the country in the 1990s. By 2001, some 3% of population possessed firearms licenses. The number of license holders was falling slightly from this point (faster as regards C licenses, while E licenses remained mostly level) until the 2015 EU Gun Ban Proposal, from which point the number of license holders began to rise again (mostly E licenses). The police recorded a tripling of average monthly applications for firearms licenses by the end of 2015 compared to the beginning of that year.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Sheriff Hill, Carr Hill and Low Fell, Deckham's {{history is}} sparsely recorded. It {{indicates}} that, {{by the middle}} of the 19th century, there was a small settlement which was part of Gateshead Fell; a wild and treacherous area of common land notable for the <b>criminality</b> of the tinkers and hawkers who lived there. Ordnance survey mapping illustrates the sparsity of buildings in 1860; the area contained little except Deckham Hall, a few other dwellings and two public houses at the point where the old turnpike road branched off towards Carr's Hill. The two public houses were the 'Speed the Plough' and 'The Ship'.|$|E
5|$|While {{he agreed}} to relieve Meyszner as HSSPF for Serbia and Montenegro, Himmler did this by {{transferring}} him to Berlin and appointing him as Generalinspekteur der Gendarmerie und Schutzpolizei der Gemeinden (General Inspector of the Gendarmerie and Schutzpolizei in the Reich) {{with the intention of}} establishing a Europe-wide gendarmerie. Nothing is known about Meyszner's activities in this role. At the end of the war, he fell {{into the hands of the}} Western Allies and his high SS rank ensured attention from investigators. He was interrogated by the United States Chief Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis <b>Criminality,</b> Robert H. Jackson, in June 1945 and was placed into Yugoslav custody soon after. His involvement in the carrying out of reprisal executions both on his own account and on behalf of the Wehrmacht, and the publication of his name along with lists of those executed, meant that his fate was certain.|$|E
5|$|Meyszner's time in Belgrade was characterised by {{friction}} and competition with German military, economic and foreign affairs officials, {{and by his}} visceral hatred and distrust of Serbs. During his tenure, he oversaw regular reprisal killings and sent {{tens of thousands of}} forced labourers to the Reich and occupied Norway. His Gestapo detachment used a gas van to kill as many as 8,000 Jewish women and children that had been detained at the Sajmište concentration camp. In April 1944, his outspoken complaints about a reduction in reprisals against civilians allowed his enemies within the German occupation regime in Serbia to have him removed. Himmler transferred him to Berlin with the task of establishing a Europe-wide gendarmerie. After the war, he fell {{into the hands of the}} Allies and was interrogated by the United States Chief Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis <b>Criminality.</b> Extradited to Yugoslavia, he was tried for war crimes, along with many of his staff from his time in Serbia. He was found guilty by a Yugoslav military court and executed by hanging in January 1947.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Liz drinks {{poisoned}} punch which Rebecca {{had intended}} for Eve. Liz accuses Eve of deliberately {{giving her the}} punch, and Eve is arrested for attempted murder. During the arrest and trial, Eve and Julian grow closer together and T. C. ends his relationship with Liz to reconcile with his ex-wife. Julian makes a deal with Rebecca that he would give her anything she wants in exchange for her testimony that she saw Liz with the vial of poison; the judge declares a mistrial. The plot then focuses on Eve's love triangle with T. C. and Julian as she is torn between taking care of T. C. after his stroke and accepting Julian's proposal of marriage. Eve discovers Julian's affair with Valerie Davis, an employee of Crane Industries, leading to her decision to nurse T. C. back to health and renew their relationship to reunite their family. Julian later explains to Eve that he was paying Valerie to search for their son; Eve forgives Valerie, and she and Julian continue their search. In 2007, Eve and Julian discover that Vincent Clarkson (a blackmailer who raped and murdered several people) is their son, and try to support him despite his criminal past. However, Eve cannot accept her son's <b>criminality</b> and incestuous, adulterous affair with Chad Harris-Crane (Vincent's uncle, adoptive cousin and brother-in-law) and begins abusing drugs and alcohol. Her career and reputation suffer, {{and she has a}} breakdown after Vincent's apparent death on August 30, 2007. In the show's final NBC episode on September 7, 2007, Vincent is revealed as intersex; he separates his identity into Vincent and Valerie, an indication of dissociative identity disorder.|$|E

25|$|The fraud that {{he spoke}} of {{regarding}} Fabre had been carried out in early October, when the French East India Company had been liquidated {{in accordance with the}} anti-capitalist legislation of the summer. The decree had apparently been falsified so that the directors were blackmailed into turning over the half-million-livre profits of this exercise to the cabal of the Convention members responsible. In 1794, Robespierre had evidence of Fabre’s <b>criminality</b> and he denounced Fabre for what he viewed as a particular heinous crime, <b>criminality</b> disguised by patriotism.|$|E
25|$|Most studies {{support a}} link between adult <b>criminality</b> and testosterone, {{although}} the relationship is modest if examined separately for each sex. Nearly all studies of juvenile delinquency and testosterone are not significant. Most studies have also found testosterone {{to be associated with}} behaviors or personality traits linked with <b>criminality</b> such as antisocial behavior and alcoholism. Many studies have also been done on the relationship between more general aggressive behavior/feelings and testosterone. About half the studies have found a relationship and about half no relationship.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, fear of immigration, Islamification and job {{and welfare}} {{benefits}} competition has fueled {{an increase in}} violence. Immigrants are perceived {{as a threat to}} ethno-nationalist identity and increase concerns over <b>criminality</b> and insecurity.|$|E
25|$|The Handbook of Crime Correlates, {{a review}} of crime studies, states most studies support a link between adult <b>criminality</b> and {{testosterone}} although the relationship is modest if examined separately for each sex.

25|$|Evidence {{presented}} by prosecutor Ludendorff attempted {{to prove the}} inherent <b>criminality</b> of the Mittelbau-Dora complex through the identified responsibility of individual defendants in {{the system as a}} whole, and by specific proof of the commission of or participation in excessive acts within that system. In addition to the living and working conditions in the camp, the prosecution also referred to the death marches as evidence of collective <b>criminality,</b> with the Gardelegen Massacre a primary focus. In their arguments, the prosecution presented more than 70 camp survivors as witnesses. The witnesses reported on the appalling conditions, especially of inadequate food and clothing, poor hygiene and poor medical care, and the imposition of punishments.|$|E
25|$|The Zócalo {{area has}} been, since 2014, where large rallies {{have been held}} in the {{aftermath}} of the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping, an event that has become symbolic for the climate of widespread <b>criminality,</b> impunity and governmental corruption that many feel the country faces.|$|E
25|$|In the Mexican and U.S. press, the Santa Muerte cult {{is often}} {{associated}} with violence, <b>criminality,</b> and the illegal drug trade. She is a popular deity in prisons, both among inmates and staff, and shrines dedicated to her can be found in many cells.|$|E
25|$|According to {{contemporary}} diplomat Fulvio Testi, the Corsican Guard was reinforced in 1637 when, {{because of an}} increase of <b>criminality</b> in the city, Pope Urban VIII (r.1623–44) recruited four hundred Corsican soldiers. However, according to Testi, their arrival did not improve the situation.|$|E
25|$|Dodd became vice {{chairman}} of the Board of Review and later executive trial counsel for the Office of the United States Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis <b>Criminality</b> at Nuremberg, Germany, in 1945 and 1946.

25|$|Some sterilizations {{took place}} in prisons and other penal institutions, {{targeting}} <b>criminality,</b> but {{they were in the}} relative minority. In the end, over 65,000 individuals were sterilized in 33 states under state compulsory sterilization programs in the United States, in all likelihood without the perspectives of ethnic minorities.|$|E
25|$|Tattoos are {{strongly}} empirically associated with deviance, personality disorders, and <b>criminality.</b> Although the general acceptance of tattoos {{is on the}} rise in Western society, they still carry a heavy stigma among certain social groups.

25|$|Machiavelli's use of Borgia {{is subject}} to controversy. Some {{scholars}} see in Machiavelli's Borgia the precursor of state crimes in the 20th century. Others, including Macaulay and Lord Acton, have historicized Machiavelli's Borgia, explaining the admiration for such violence as an effect of the general <b>criminality</b> and corruption of the time.|$|E
25|$|Radio 4 criticised Twitter's {{contribution}} to the riots through greed and <b>criminality.</b> The Daily Telegraph described Twitter as being an outlet for promoting gang violence. Evidence shows that Twitter is powerful because tweets of individuals were inspired by news content. However, an article in Time magazine suggested BlackBerry Messenger was more to blame.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has also}} found a low {{expression}} of reward dependence in suicide attempters. These findings and the negative correlation between reward dependence {{and the number of}} suicide attempts may suggest the implication of the noradrenergic pathway in suicide behaviors. Low scores of RD have also been implicated in showing <b>criminality</b> in adult age.|$|E
25|$|Second Thoughts Are Best: or, a Further Improvement of a Late Scheme to Prevent Street Robberies is a 1729 {{pamphlet}} by Daniel Defoe.

25|$|Writers such as Boxhall, The Story of Australian Bushrangers (1899) and Henry Giles Turner, History of the Colony of Victoria (1904) {{describe}} the Kelly Outbreak {{as simply a}} spate of <b>criminality.</b> Two of those involved, Superintendents Hare and Sadleir, and later, in the late 20th century Penzig (1988) wrote legitimising narratives about law and order and moral justification.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} side {{there are some people}} who prefer to attend private {{institutions}} because they don't trust in the public educational infrastructure they have near their residential area.

25|$|When {{questioned}} about his wealth, Askin always attributed {{it to the}} salary from his high public office, his frugal lifestyle, good investments and canny punting.

25|$|The riots have {{generated}} significant ongoing debate among political, {{social and academic}} figures about the causes and {{context in which they}} happened.
