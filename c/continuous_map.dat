5|$|A <b>continuous</b> <b>map</b> {{between two}} topological spaces induces a group {{homomorphism}} between the associated homotopy groups. In particular, if the map is a continuous bijection (a homeomorphism), {{so that the}} two spaces have the same topology, then their i-th homotopy groups are isomorphic for all i. However, the real plane has exactly the same homotopy groups as a solitary point (as does a Euclidean space of any dimension), and the real plane with a point removed has the same groups as a circle, so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate, it can also make certain computations easier.|$|E
25|$|Let f be a <b>continuous</b> <b>map</b> from R to Rℓ (R in {{the lower}} limit topology). Since R is {{connected}}, {{and the image of}} a connected space under a <b>continuous</b> <b>map</b> must be connected, the image of R under f must be connected. Therefore, the image of R under f must be a subset of a component of Rℓ. Since this image is nonempty, the only continuous maps from R to Rℓ, are the constant maps. In fact, any <b>continuous</b> <b>map</b> from a connected space to a totally disconnected space must be constant.|$|E

25|$|Symmetric to {{the concept}} of a <b>continuous</b> <b>map</b> is an open map, for which images of open sets are open. In fact, if an open map f has an inverse function, that inverse is continuous, and if a <b>continuous</b> <b>map</b> g has an inverse, that inverse is open. Given a {{bijective}} function f between two topological spaces, the inverse function f−1 need not be continuous. A bijective continuous function with continuous inverse function is called a homeomorphism.|$|E

25|$|If s is {{an element}} of F(U) and α : U → R is a <b>{{continuous}}</b> <b>map,</b> then αs (pointwise scalar multiplication) is in F(U). We see that F(U) is a module over the ring of continuous real-valued functions on U. Furthermore, if OX denotes the structure sheaf of continuous real-valued functions on X, then F becomes a sheaf of OX-modules.|$|E
25|$|Besides the fixed-point theorems {{for more}} or less {{contracting}} functions, there are many that have emerged directly or indirectly from the result under discussion. A <b>continuous</b> <b>map</b> from a closed ball of Euclidean space to its boundary cannot be the identity on the boundary. Similarly, the Borsuk–Ulam theorem says that a <b>continuous</b> <b>map</b> from the n-dimensional sphere to Rn has a pair of antipodal points that are mapped to the same point. In the finite-dimensional case, the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem provided from 1926 a method for counting fixed points. In 1930, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem was generalized to Banach spaces. This generalization is known as Schauder's fixed-point theorem, a result generalized further by S. Kakutani to multivalued functions. One also meets the theorem and its variants outside topology. It {{can be used to}} prove the Hartman-Grobman theorem, which describes the qualitative behaviour of certain differential equations near certain equilibria. Similarly, Brouwer's theorem is used for the proof of the Central Limit Theorem. The theorem can also be found in existence proofs for the solutions of certain partial differential equations.|$|E
25|$|A section (or cross section) of a {{fiber bundle}} π is a <b>continuous</b> <b>map</b> f : B → E such that π(f(x))=x for all x in B. Since bundles do not in general have {{globally}} defined sections, {{one of the}} purposes of the theory is to account for their existence. The obstruction to the existence of a section can often be measured by a cohomology class, which leads to the theory of characteristic classes in algebraic topology.|$|E

25|$|Stone-Čech compactification. Let KHaus be the {{category}} of compact Hausdorff spaces and G : KHaus → Top be the inclusion functor to {{the category}} of topological spaces. Then G has a left adjoint F : Top → KHaus, the Stone–Čech compactification. The unit of this adjoint pair yields a <b>continuous</b> <b>map</b> from every topological space X into its Stone-Čech compactification. This map is an embedding (i.e. injective, continuous and open) {{if and only if}} X is a Tychonoff space.|$|E
25|$|Often {{one would}} like to define {{sections}} only locally (especially when global sections do not exist). A local section of a fiber bundle is a <b>continuous</b> <b>map</b> f : U → E where U is an open set in B and π(f(x))=x for all x in U. If (U, φ) is a local trivialization chart then local sections always exist over U. Such sections are in 1-1 correspondence with continuous maps U → F. Sections form a sheaf.|$|E
25|$|Metric {{spaces are}} paracompact Hausdorff spaces and hence normal (indeed they are {{perfectly}} normal).

It {{is also true that}} every real-valued Lipschitz-continuous map defined on a subset of a metric space can be extended to a Lipschitz-continuous map on the whole space.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} maps (or morphisms) from one sheaf to another; sheaves (of a {{specific}} type, such as sheaves of abelian groups) with their morphisms {{on a fixed}} topological space form a category. On the other hand, to each <b>continuous</b> <b>map</b> there is associated both a direct image functor, taking sheaves and their morphisms on the domain to sheaves and morphisms on the codomain, and an inverse image functor operating in the opposite direction. These functors, and certain variants of them, are essential parts of sheaf theory.|$|E
