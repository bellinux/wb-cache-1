40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{molecular}} weight (MW) and charge density (CD) of cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) on sludge dewatering and moisture evaporation were investigated in this study. Results indicated that in sludge conditioning, the optimum dosages were 10, 6, 6, 4, and 4 mg g(- 1) CPAM with 5 million MW and 20 % CD, 5 million MW and 40 % CD, 3 million MW and 40 % CD, 8 million MW and 40 % CD, and 5 million MW and 60 % CD, respectively. The optimum dosage of CPAM was negatively correlated with its CD or MW if the CD or MW of CPAM was above 20 % or 5 million. In the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>dewatering</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge,</b> the moisture content in the conditioned sludge gradually decreased with the extension of centrifugation time, and the economical centrifugal force was 400 ×g. The moisture evaporation rates of the conditioned sludge were closely related to sludge dewaterability, which was in turn significantly correlated either positively with the solid content of sludge particles that were > 2 mm in size or negatively with that of particles measuring 1 mm to 2 mm in diameter. During treatment, sludge moisture content was reduced from 80 % to 20 % by evaporation, and the moisture evaporation rates were 1. 35, 1. 49, 1. 62, and 2. 24 times faster in the sludge conditioned using 4 mg g(- 1) CPAM with 5 million MW and 60 % CD than in the sludge conditioned using 4 mg g(- 1) CPAM with 8 million MW and 40 % CD, 6 mg g(- 1) CPAM with 5 million MW and 40 % CD, 6 mg g(- 1) CPAM with 3 million MW and 40 % CD, and 10 mg g(- 1) CPAM with 5 million MW and 20 % CD, respectively.

Methods: In-vitro preparation and <b>dewatering</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> by combination <b>of</b> polyacrylamide activated with aluminum oxide nanoparticles were carried out in two main steps of determination of pH and optimal dose of activated coagulant aid. For measuring <b>sludge</b> <b>dewatering</b> capability, tests <b>of</b> time <b>of</b> filtration (TTF), <b>sludge</b> cake moisture content, turbidity, and total suspended solids <b>of</b> effluent from <b>sludge</b> cake filtration were evaluated. Results: Modified coagulant aid with aluminum oxide nanoparticles in optimum pH and concentrations of 5 and 4 mg/l, respectively, had the best efficiency and was more suitable than a primary coagulant without any modification. The levelsof TTF, sludge cake moisture, turbidity, and total suspended solids of effluent reduced 24. 4 %, 11. 2 %, 57. 2 %, and 58 %, respectively, in comparison with the control group.

40|$|It was {{the aim of}} {{the project}} to improve the {{mechanical}} <b>dewatering</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> by freezing. The <b>dewatering</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> to high contents of dry solids is prohibited by the water trapped within the cells <b>of</b> the <b>sludge.</b> By freezing the cell water can be released partly due to osmotic effects and damages of the cell walls. Three types <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> were investigated: aerobically and anaerobically stabilized sludge and not stabilized sludge. After the conditioning by freezing the content of dry solids could be raised with the same dewatering device from 25 % to 40 % by weight for not stabilized sludge, from 33 % to 45 % for the aerobically stabilized sludge and from 42 % to 60 % for the anaerobically stabilized sludge. That means for all sludges that the quantity of water to be evaporated in a following drying process is reduced by about 50 %. Therefore important energy savings are possible but the realization <b>of</b> the <b>sludge</b> conditioning by freezing as a continuous process is impeded mainly by the very low freezing velocity of about 1 mm/h, necessary for the reported improvements.

40|$|Many {{previous}} {{studies have demonstrated that}} electroosmotic dewatering is an effective technique to dewater sewage sludge. However, the technology has not yet been successfully applied in industry. This is because there are several technological barriers to the commercial exploitation of the technology that are yet to be resolved. One of these barriers is a scientifically robust design methodology. This aim {{of this study is to}} establisha qualitative and quantitative understanding model <b>of</b> electroosmotic <b>dewatering</b> <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> and from this produce a robust design methodology. This study is divided into three parts: The first part evaluates the feasibility <b>of</b> electroosmotic <b>dewatering</b> under constant voltage for range <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> types. A number of experiments with four different sewage sludges were undertaken to examine the dewatering efficiency in terms <b>of</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>dewatering,</b> final solid concentration and energy consumption. The results showed that electroosmotic <b>dewatering</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> is both feasible and potentially economic. It is also shown that the use of the Helmholtz-Smolucowski flow eqPation, together with the assumptions of no electrochemical reaction and a constant electroosmotic permeability, to predict the dewatering process is not sound. The second part of this thesis presents an integrating framework for electroosmotic dewatering under constant voltage and constant current, founded on the mathematics of simple electricalc ircuits and demonstrated by laboratory experimentation. The derived equations and experimental results showed that electroosmotic flow rate decreases with time when dewatering with constant voltage and is constant when dewatering with constant current. Having a linear relationship between flow and time, electroosmotic dewatering with constant current not only enhances the sludge dewatering efficiency, but also has the advantage of simplifying design procedures. The third part explores in further detail each of the design parameters <b>of</b> electroosmotic <b>dewatering</b> under constant current, including sample thickness, current, time over which constant current could be maintained, power supply, pressure and type of electrodes.

Mineralization processes seemed to be uninfluenced by seasonal changing. The metabolic index given by the ratio DH-ase/WSC increased with time from 0. 007 to 0. 02, implying that sludge organic matter mineralization was approaching maximum efficiency. Aerobic mineralization processes were quickly activated, as shown by the production of ammonia at 3 days and nitrate at 15 days. Nitrates conditioned the redox potential <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> to relatively high values: from + 50 to + 150 mV in summer and + 10 to + 100 mV in winter. The positive redox potentials supported the organic carbon respiration because nitrates function as electron acceptors in the absence or scarcity of free atmospheric oxygen in the deeper layers. All these factors allow the system to (i) operate longer, with high loads applications <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> and in any climate conditions, thereby making feasible onsite sludge stabilisation and thickening, and (ii) avoid frequent sludge transportation outside the wastewater treatment plant.

This effect {{did not appear to be}} due merely to the state of dryness <b>of</b> the <b>sludge</b> samples because in humus-deficient soil, a relatively inert material, the rate of poliovirus inactivation by heat was not significantly altered through dewatering. Instead, this effect appeared to have been caused by protective substances in the sludge, such as detergents, which are concentrated through dewatering. As reported previously (R. L. Ward and C. S. Ashley, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 34 : 681 - 688, 1977; R. L. Ward and C. S. Ashley, Appl. Environ. Microbiol 36 : 889 [...] 897, 1978) raw sludge is not protective of reovirus, but, instead, the ionic detergents in sludge cause the rate of heat inactivation of this virus to be accelerated. <b>Dewatering</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge,</b> however, was found to partially reverse this virucidal effect. Evidence is presented indicating that this reversal is caused by an unidentified protective substance in sludge also concentrated through dewatering. Finally, it was shown that the effects <b>of</b> raw <b>sludge</b> on heat inactivation of poliovirus and reovirus are greatly reduced by composting, a result that correlated with the degradation of detergents...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} methods for {{dewatering}} technological slurry as a byproduct in the mining industry. The objective {{focuses on the}} current sludge dewatering system in the Sklopísek Střeleč a. s. quarry, where only clarifier tanks and gravitational thickening are used for solids separation. The solution is primarily focused on the technology <b>of</b> mechanical <b>dewatering</b> <b>of</b> fine-grained materials. The body of this thesis describes the most used industrial technologies for the processing <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> from mineral extraction, such as presses, centrifuges, belt presses and drum filters. Laboratory tests mainly affect the mineralogical, chemical and grain composition <b>of</b> the <b>sludge.</b> This thesis will also analyze the investment and operating costs for the acquisition and operation of technology capable <b>of</b> <b>dewatering</b> <b>sludge</b> in larger scaled operations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProteins {{extracted}} from the seeds of Moringa trees are effective flocculents for particles dispersed in water and are attractive as a natural and sustainable product for use in water purification. Studies with a model system consisting of polystyrene latex particles {{have shown that the}} protein adsorbs to the surface and causes flocculation as unusually dense aggregates. Small-angle neutron scattering that exploits contrast matching of deuterated latex particles dispersed in D 2 O to highlight bound protein has shown that the adsorbed amount reaches about 3 mgm− 2. The particles form very compact flocs that are characterized by fractal dimensions that approach the theoretical maximum of 3. Ultra small-angle neutron scattering allows these flocs to be characterized for a range of particle and protein concentrations. Proteins from two species of Moringa trees were investigated. The protein from Moringa stenopetala seeds gave rise to slightly lower fractal dimensions compared to Moringa oleifera, but still much larger than values observed for conventional ionic or polymeric flocculents that are in the range 1. 75 – 2. 3. Compact flocs are desirable for efficient separation <b>of</b> impurities and <b>dewatering</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> as well as other applications. A trend of increasing fractal dimension with particle concentration was observed when M. stenopetala seed protein was used and this resembles the behaviour predicted in Brownian dynamics simulation of flocculation...|$|R

Earlier studies <b>of</b> the <b>sludge</b> {{used in this study}} industrial sludge from Björkborn industrial area in Karlskoga, showed good methane production potential during mesophilic conditions[31] but increased toxicity in the digested sludge[32 – 34]. <b>Dewatering</b> and treatment <b>of</b> this particular <b>sludge</b> demonstrated high dewatering capacity and reduced nutrient levels in outgoing water and sludge residue[29] as well as significantly reduced toxicity in outgoing water and bed material of reed beds measured with DR-CALUX, Umu-C assay and fish embryo toxicity test using Danio rerio[30].|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} investigating the effect of different particle sizes of sand for the <b>dewatering</b> <b>of</b> faecal <b>sludge</b> {{with respect to the}} dewatering time, contaminant load in the percolate, rate of clogging and quantity of biosolids produced. Three filter media FM 1, FM 2 and FM 3 were used to dewater the faecal sludge. The experiment was conducted on bench scale consisting of miniature drying beds. Six cycles <b>of</b> <b>dewatering</b> were run where FM 1, FM 2, and FM 3 showed average <b>dewatering</b> times <b>of</b> 10, 10 and 9 days respectively without significant differences (p > 0. 05). However the percolate quality showed significant differences between them in the removal of TS, TVS, SS, COD, DCOD and NH 3 -N with FM 1 having the highest removal for each parameter. Accumulation of organic matter in the top 10 cm of the filter bed indicated that FM 1 was least likely to clog and it also generated the highest quantity of biosolids...|$|R
