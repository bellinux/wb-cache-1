40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} several models of a deep convolutional auto-encoder in the <b>Caffe</b> <b>deep</b> learning framework and their experimental evaluation on the example of MNIST dataset. We have created five models of a convolutional auto-encoder which differ architecturally by {{the presence or absence}} of pooling and unpooling layers in the auto-encoder's encoder and decoder parts. Our results show that the developed models provide very good results in dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering tasks, and small classification errors when we used the learned internal code as an input of a supervised linear classifier and multi-layer perceptron. The best results were provided by a model where the encoder part contains convolutional and pooling layers, followed by an analogous decoder part with deconvolution and unpooling layers without the use of switch variables in the decoder part. The paper also discusses practical details of the creation of a deep convolutional auto-encoder in the very popular <b>Caffe</b> <b>deep</b> learning framework. We believe that our approach and results presented in this paper could help other researchers to build efficient deep neural network architectures in the future.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new deep {{convolutional}} neural network (DCNN) architecture that learns pixel embeddings, such that pairwise distances between the embeddings can be used to infer whether or not the pixels lie on the same region. That is, for any two pixels on the same object, the embeddings are trained to be similar; for any pair that straddles an object boundary, the embeddings are trained to be dissimilar. Experimental results show that when this embedding network is used in conjunction with a DCNN trained on semantic segmentation, there is a systematic improvement in per-pixel classification accuracy. Our contributions are integrated in the popular <b>Caffe</b> <b>deep</b> learning framework, and consist in straightforward modifications to convolution routines. As such, they can be exploited for any task involving convolution layers...|$|E

40|$|Drogue {{detection}} is {{a fundamental}} issue during the close docking phase of autonomous aerial refueling (AAR). To cope with this issue, a novel and effective method based on deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed. In order to ensure its robustness and wide application, a deep learning dataset of images was prepared by utilizing real data of “Probe and Drogue” aerial refueling, which contains diverse drogues in various environmental conditions without artificial features placed on the drogues. By employing deep learning ideas and graphics processing units (GPUs), a model for drogue detection using a <b>Caffe</b> <b>deep</b> learning framework with CNNs was designed to ensure the method’s accuracy and real-time performance.

40|$|Training deep {{networks}} is a time-consuming process, with {{networks for}} object recognition often requiring multiple days to train. For this reason, leveraging {{the resources of}} a cluster to speed up training is an important area of work. However, widely-popular batch-processing computational frameworks like MapReduce and Spark were not designed to support the asynchronous and communication-intensive workloads of existing distributed deep learning systems. We introduce SparkNet, a framework for training deep networks in Spark. Our implementation includes a convenient interface for reading data from Spark RDDs, a Scala interface to the <b>Caffe</b> <b>deep</b> learning framework, and a lightweight multi-dimensional tensor library. Using a simple parallelization scheme for stochastic gradient descent, SparkNet scales well with the cluster size and tolerates very high-latency communication. Furthermore, {{it is easy to}} deploy and use with no parameter tuning, and it is compatible with existing Caffe models. We quantify the dependence of the speedup obtained by SparkNet on the number of machines, the communication frequency, and the cluster's communication overhead, and we benchmark our system's performance on the ImageNet dataset.

Among the traffic participants we find pedestrians are the one who are most vulnerable and their safety is also crucial. Therefore, this work focuses on pedestrian detection in urban environment using the camera mounted on ego vehicle. The thesis aims at understanding and comparison of shallow and deep learning approaches for pedestrian detection, and two ensemble methods are proposed that combines the chosen deep and shallow method with the context-based classifier respectively. Firstly, an pre-trained deep architecture for object detection is combined with the context-based classifier. Whereas, in second method shallow approach is combined with context-based classifier. Further in the outlook of this work stereo data is used to minimize the detected false positives form the proposed ensemble deep approach. Prototyping of first proposed method is achieved using the <b>CAFFE</b> <b>deep</b> learning framework with Python interface, and the second shallow method is achieved using the well known computer vision library OpenCV with C++.

KNL has {{generated}} significant interest in the data analysis and machine learning communities because its new many-core architecture targets both of these workloads. The KNL many-core vector processor design enables it to exploit much higher levels of parallelism. At the Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center (LLSC), the majority of users are running data analysis applications such as MATLAB and Octave. More recently, machine learning applications, such as the UC Berkeley <b>Caffe</b> <b>deep</b> learning framework, have become increasingly important to LLSC users. Thus, the performance of these applications on KNL systems is of high interest to LLSC users and the broader data analysis and machine learning communities. Our data analysis benchmarks of these application on the Intel KNL processor indicate that single-core double-precision generalized matrix multiply (DGEMM) performance on KNL systems has improved by ~ 3. 5 x compared to prior Intel Xeon technologies.
