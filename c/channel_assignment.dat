25|$|WTVR-TV is a CBS-affiliated {{television}} station licensed to Richmond, Virginia, United States. The station {{is owned by}} Tribune Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Tribune Media Company. It broadcasts a high definition digital signal on UHF channel 25, using the virtual <b>channel</b> <b>assignment</b> of 6.1 via PSIP (to associate it with its 60-year former position on analog channel 6), and its studios and transmitter are located on West Broad Street in the West End {{of the city of}} Richmond. The tower is also the transmitter for former sister station WTVR-FM and NPR member WCVE-FM.|$|E
25|$|A {{deal between}} TVNZ and Sky to have TVNZ 6 and 7 {{available}} to Sky subscribers {{in exchange for}} Prime finally being launched on Freeview with a virtual <b>channel</b> <b>assignment</b> of 10 on 17 August 2009. If Prime would have joined at launch then {{they may have been}} able to get a lower assignment, however virtual channel assignments are only enforced on certified receivers. It is also noted virtual channel 10 is not far off its usual tuning to push-button 9 on analogue television sets, due to its historic links with the Nine Network, its allocation on Sky's former analogue terrestrial service, and for compatibility with video recorders using the G-Code scheduling system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we first present a {{uniformity}} property that characterises optimal <b>channel</b> <b>assignments</b> for networks arranged as cellular or square grids. Then, we present optimal <b>channel</b> <b>assignments</b> for cellular and square grids; these assignments exhibit {{a high value}} for δ 1 – the separation between channels assigned to adjacent stations. We prove an upper bound on δ 1 for such optimal <b>channel</b> <b>assignments.</b> This upper bound {{is greater than the}} value of δ 1 exhibited by our assignments. Based on empirical evidence, we conjecture that the value our assignments exhibit is a tight upper bound on δ 1...|$|R

WSHM is {{owned and operated}} by Meredith Broadcasting and shares studios with WGGB on Liberty Street near the Chicopee line. WSHM-LD and WGGB broadcast local news under the branding [...] "Western Mass News", and maintain a relationship with the Springfield Republican. WSHM-LD was formerly W67DF, a translator of TBN, before being sold to Meredith. WSHM-LD is referred to as [...] "CBS 3", denoting its cable <b>channel</b> <b>assignment</b> within the market and to encourage long-time viewers of WFSB to stay with WSHM-LD.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1930s, KDKA {{began the}} long-running (1932–1980) Uncle Ed Shaughency show. The station played popular big band and jazz music every morning {{as well as}} hosting the KDKA Farm Hour. From 1941 to 1959, the Farm Hour was built around farm reports along with music by Slim Bryant and his Wildcats, who {{eventually}} became the top local country music act in the Pittsburgh area. Special programming included ongoing coverage of the 1936 St. Patrick's Day flood that submerged downtown Pittsburgh as far as Wood Street. A final frequency change took place in March 1941, under {{the provisions of the}} North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, as KDKA's clear <b>channel</b> <b>assignment</b> was shifted from 980 to 1020 kHz.|$|E

Richmond-area stations will begin testing in January 2020, and will have to move to their new channels by March 13, 2020.

50|$|In 1997, Seagull Communications sold KSGI-TV to Bonneville Holding Company, a {{broadcasting}} company wholly {{owned by the}} Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The sale {{was approved by the}} FCC on December 10, 1997 and was consummated on April 27, 1998. On February 16, 1998, the station changed its call letters to KXIV, in anticipation of its DTV <b>channel</b> <b>assignment</b> on UHF channel 14, but the FCC adopted the virtual channel standard, whereby digital stations would continue to identify by their analog <b>channel</b> <b>assignment,</b> and on May 15, 1998, the station again changed call letters, this time to KCSG. On August 31, 1998, the station became a charter affiliate of the family-oriented network Pax TV (now Ion Television). In August 2002, KCSG was sold to Broadcast West, a St. George-based partnership of Daniel Matheson and local auto dealer Stephen Wade. The new owners elected to continue the Pax affiliation and to maintain an association with Bonneville-owned KSL-TV (channel 5).|$|E
