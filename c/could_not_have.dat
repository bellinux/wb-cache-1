5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial flagellum are so complex and interdependent that they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> evolved from simpler systems.|$|E

5|$|Tregelles dated the {{manuscript}} to the 8th century. Tregelles {{was aware that}} the handwriting is typical for the 6th century, but the handwriting of the commentary is much older. The letters ΕΘΟΣ are round, high, and narrow, and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been written before the 8th century. C. R. Gregory supported Tregelles's point of view. According to Nicholas Pocock, {{the manuscript}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been written before the 6th century nor after the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|A further {{complication}} is that {{a certain}} proportion of the Allied manpower was needed to man the fleet, which amounted to at least 110 triremes, and thus approximately 22,000 men. Since the Battle of Mycale was fought at least near-simultaneously with the Battle of Plataea, then this was a pool of manpower which <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> contributed to Plataea, and further reduces the likelihood that 110,000 Greeks assembled before Plataea.|$|E

5|$|Camden County Coroner Robert J. Blake ruled {{her death}} an accident; {{a case of}} {{starvation}} with exposure as a contributing factor.

5|$|Connolly {{has argued}} that they were armed as a pike phalanx. This has been disputed by Head, because Plutarch states they carried spears shorter than the Roman triarii and by Daly because they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> carried an {{unwieldy}} pike {{at the same time}} as a heavy Roman-style shield.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} investigation, police had noted {{undisturbed}} human excrement {{in the elevator}} shaft, which Conley said he had left there before the murder. Use of the elevator on the Monday after the murder crushed the excrement, which Slaton concluded was {{an indication that the}} elevator <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been used as described by Conley, casting doubt on his testimony.|$|E

Each volunteer who joined the [...] "Green Hussars" [...] had to supply a horse to the regiment from his own resources. Those who <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> to pay at least 25 talers. Amtsrat Breymann put 20,000 talers at the disposal of the regiment.|$|R
5|$|Hal Rogers's brother John {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{even though he}} was in state prison serving a sentence for the rape of a woman who had shared his trailer, {{at the time of the}} murders. Police, investigating the woman's rape allegation, found evidence indicating that he had also sexually assaulted Hal's daughter Michelle, although charges involving this assault were later dropped because of her reluctance to testify. The St. Petersburg Times said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> known the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was dismissed as a suspect.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the claims}} for 15 September 1942 are in serious doubt, {{following}} the first detailed {{scrutiny of the}} records of individual Allied squadrons by Australian historian Russell Brown. Moreover, Brown lists three occasions on which Marseille <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> downed as many aircraft as claimed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} analysis, {{it made no}} difference; Fletcher's {{carriers}} had launched their planes beginning at 07:00 (with Enterprise and Hornet having completed launching by 07:55, but Yorktown not until 09:08), so the aircraft that would deliver the crushing blow were already on their way. Even if Nagumo had not strictly followed carrier doctrine, he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> prevented {{the launch of the}} American attack.|$|E

60|$|He {{knew that}} she had thought him uncouth and impossible. Why <b>could</b> <b>not</b> Hank <b>have</b> exerted himself more, instead of sitting there in that stuffed way? Why <b>could</b> <b>not</b> Ruth <b>have</b> unbent? Why <b>had</b> <b>not</b> he himself done {{something}} to save the situation? Of the three, he blamed himself most. He was the one who should have taken the lead and made things pleasant for everybody instead of forcing out conversational platitudes.|$|R

5|$|In {{the sixth}} edition Darwin {{inserted}} {{a new chapter}} VII (renumbering the subsequent chapters) to respond to criticisms of earlier editions, including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been produced by natural selection. He said some such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on Fertilisation of Orchids that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to George Jackson Mivart's criticisms, including his claim that features such as baleen filters in whales, flatfish with both eyes {{on one side and}} the camouflage of stick insects <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. Darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature.|$|E
5|$|Installation of {{military}} communications equipment {{and plans to}} reclaim land. Malaysia alleged that Singapore's installation {{of military}} communications equipment on Pedra Branca was done secretly, {{and that it had}} only learned about this when it received Singapore's memorial in the case. As regards Singapore's plans to reclaim land around the island, Malaysia said it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> reacted to some of the documents as they had been secret.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{commonly}} hypothesized that Pachycephalosaurus and its relatives were the bipedal equivalents of bighorn sheep or musk oxen, where male individuals would ram each other headlong, {{and that they}} would horizontally straighten their head, neck, and body in order to transmit stress during ramming. However, there have also been alternative suggestions that the pachycephalosaurs <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> used their domes in this way.|$|E

5|$|Ochre is {{reported}} from some early MSA sites, for example at Kapthurin and Twin Rivers, and is common after c. 100 ka. Barham argues {{that even if}} some of this ochre was used in a symbolic, color-related role then this abstraction <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> worked without language. Ochre, he suggests, could be one proxy for {{trying to find the}} emergence of language.|$|E
5|$|Scientists do not {{yet know}} what these dinosaurs ate.

It is assumed that pachycephalosaurs lived on a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, and fruits. The sharp, serrated teeth would have been very effective for shredding plants.|$|E
5|$|Since Johor <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> ceded Singapore {{island and}} the islets in its {{vicinity}} to the British if it lacked title to them, this {{was evidence that}} the United Kingdom recognised the prior and continuing sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate over all islands {{in and around the}} Singapore Strait.|$|E
