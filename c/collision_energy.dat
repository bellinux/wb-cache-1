25|$|After {{some years}} of running, any {{particle}} physics experiment typically begins {{to suffer from}} diminishing returns: as the key results reachable by the device begin to be completed, later years of operation discover proportionately less than earlier years. A common response is to upgrade the devices involved, typically in <b>collision</b> <b>energy,</b> luminosity, or improved detectors. In addition to a possible increase to 14TeV <b>collision</b> <b>energy</b> in 2018, a luminosity upgrade of the LHC, called the High Luminosity LHC, is planned, to be made after 2022.|$|E
25|$|The {{first test}} which ran in September 2008 was {{expected}} to operate at a lower <b>collision</b> <b>energy</b> of 10TeV but this was prevented by the 19 September 2008 shutdown. When at this target level, the LHC will have a significantly reduced luminosity, due to both fewer proton bunches in each beam and fewer protons per bunch. The reduced bunch frequency does allow the crossing angle to be reduced to zero however, as bunches are far enough spaced to prevent secondary collisions in the experimental beampipe.|$|E

The differential cross section, as analyzed with a Monte Carlo reconstruction algorithm, shows significant large angle scattering for lower <b>collision</b> <b>energies</b> in qualitative agreement with previous experiments. Significant vibrational excitation of N+ 2 is also observed. This theoretically still unexplained feature indicates the presence of a low energy scattering resonance...|$|R

25|$|To {{find the}} Higgs boson, a {{powerful}} particle accelerator was needed, because Higgs bosons {{might not be}} seen in lower-energy experiments. The collider needed {{to have a high}} luminosity in order to ensure enough collisions were seen for conclusions to be drawn. Finally, advanced computing facilities were needed to process the vast amount of data (25 petabytes per year as of 2012) produced by the collisions. For the announcement of 4 July 2012, a new collider known as the Large Hadron Collider was constructed at CERN with a planned eventual <b>collision</b> <b>energy</b> of 14 TeV—over seven times any previous collider—and over 300 trillion (3×1014) LHC proton–proton collisions were analysed by the LHC Computing Grid, the world's largest computing grid (as of 2012), comprising over 170 computing facilities in a worldwide network across 36 countries.|$|E
2500|$|This {{cross section}} is {{calculated}} neglecting the electron mass {{relative to the}} <b>collision</b> <b>energy</b> and including only the contribution from photon exchange. [...] This is a valid approximation at collision energies small compared to the mass scale of the Z boson, about 91 GeV; at higher energies the contribution from Z boson exchange also becomes important.|$|E
2500|$|Usually {{the metal}} acetate and the organic proligand are mixed and ground {{up with a}} ball mill. Cu3(BTC)2 can be quickly {{synthesised}} in this way in quantitative yield. In the case of Cu3(BTC)2 the morphology of the solvent free synthesised product {{was the same as}} the industrially made Basolite C300. It is thought that localised melting of the components due to the high <b>collision</b> <b>energy</b> in the ball mill may assist the reaction. The formation of acetic acid as a by-product in the reactions in the ball mill may also help in the reaction having a solvent effect in the ball mill.|$|E

40|$|We present {{measurements}} of the energy dependence of event-by-event fluctuations in the K/π and (p+p̅) /π multiplicity ratios in heavy-ion collisions at the CERN SPS. The particle ratio fluctuations were obtained for central Pb+Pb collisions at five <b>collision</b> <b>energies,</b> √sNN, between 6. 3 and 17. 3 GeV.

2500|$|When {{running at}} the current energy record of 6.5 TeV per proton, {{once or twice a}} day, as the protons are {{accelerated}} from 450GeV to 6.5TeV, the field of the superconducting dipole magnets will be increased from 0.54 to [...] The protons each have an energy of 6.5TeV, giving a total <b>collision</b> <b>energy</b> of 13TeV. At this energy the protons have a Lorentz factor of about 6,930 and move at about , or about [...] slower than the speed of light (c). It takes less than [...] for a proton to travel once around the main ring– a speed of about [...] per second. Rather than having continuous beams, the protons are bunched together, into up to , with [...] in each bunch so that interactions between the two beams take place at discrete intervals, mainly [...] apart, providing a bunch collision rate of 40MHz. It was operated with fewer bunches in the first years. The design luminosity of the LHC is 1034 cm−2s−1, which was first reached in June 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Data {{collection}} at the LHC finally commenced in March 2010. By December 2011 the two main particle detectors at the LHC, ATLAS and CMS, had narrowed down the mass range where the Higgs could exist to around 116-130 GeV (ATLAS) and 115-127 GeV (CMS). There had also already {{been a number of}} promising event excesses that had [...] "evaporated" [...] and proven to be nothing but random fluctuations. However, from around May 2011, both experiments had seen among their results, the slow emergence of a small yet consistent excess of gamma and 4-lepton decay signatures and several other particle decays, all hinting at a new particle at a mass around [...] By around November 2011, the anomalous data at 125GeV was becoming [...] "too large to ignore" [...] (although still far from conclusive), and the team leaders at both ATLAS and CMS each privately suspected they might have found the Higgs. On November 28, 2011, at an internal meeting of the two team leaders and the director general of CERN, the latest analyses were discussed outside their teams for the first time, suggesting both ATLAS and CMS might be converging on a possible shared result at 125GeV, and initial preparations commenced in case of a successful finding. While this information was not known publicly at the time, the narrowing of the possible Higgs range to around 115–130 GeV and the repeated observation of small but consistent event excesses across multiple channels at both ATLAS and CMS in the 124-126 GeV region (described as [...] "tantalising hints" [...] of around 2-3 sigma) were public knowledge with [...] "a lot of interest". It was therefore widely anticipated around the end of 2011, that the LHC would provide sufficient data to either exclude or confirm the finding of a Higgs boson by the end of 2012, when their 2012 collision data (with slightly higher 8TeV <b>collision</b> <b>energy)</b> had been examined.|$|E

Simulations have been done within a three-fluid model employing a purely hadronic equation of state (EoS) and two versions of the EoS with deconfinement transitions: a first-order phase transition and a smooth crossover transition. The crossover EoS is unambiguously preferable for the description of experimental data at lower <b>collision</b> <b>energies</b> s N N ≲ 20 Gev. However, at higher <b>collision</b> <b>energies</b> s N N ≳ 20 Gev. the purely hadronic EoS again becomes advantageous.

The question is discussed how the energy {{dependence of the}} transfer rate can be extracted from available experimental data. A model is suggested {{which is based on}} two assumptions. First, the muon transfer occurs within an interaction sphere out of which the entrance and transfer channels are not coupled. Secondly, for the s- and p-waves at low <b>collision</b> <b>energies,</b> the complex logarithmic derivatives of the radial wave functions of the entrance channel on the interaction sphere are energy-independent. With only the s-wave taken into account, two values of the logarithmic derivative were found, which agree with the transfer rates measured at the temperatures of 20 and 300 K. Within this temperature interval, the rates evaluated for these two values differ only slightly. Noticeable differences arise at temperatures of a few kelvins. The choice of the preferred value of the logarithmic derivative was made by the comparison of the energy dependence of the S-matrix with results of previous calculations.
