Collectively, they finished the checkpoint first with Vince & Jenna coming in second, and Devin & Cheyenne coming in last. Vince & Jenna arrived at the second checkpoint first. The checkpoint was a giant memory game. Bananas finished first and got the point, and once again, Bananas & Sarah were the first team to complete the checkpoint. Vince & Jenna were second with Devin & Cheyenne once again in last. Checkpoint 3 was a two-dimensional, life-sized puzzle. Vince finished first but had to help Jenna finish, so Bananas & Sarah were actually the first team to finish the third checkpoint. Sarah finished before Bananas, so she got the point. Vince finished before Jenna. Cheyenne finished before Devin finally getting a point compared to Devin's two. Vince and Jenna edged out Bananas & Sarah on a subsequent run to finish out the first day. To end the day, each team member took turns staying up at night (Whichever team member stayed up the longest earned 2 points.). The second day consisted of eating gross foods to earn points, and then a climb {{up the rest of the}} mountain to the finish line. By the end of day two, Bananas & Sarah took first place (Bananas had more points), Vince & Jenna took second (Vince had more points), and Devin & Cheyenne finished in last (Devin had more points). The final checkpoint involved climbing a mountain, and whichever team arrived at the summit first was the winner of Rivals III.|$|E

The coiled wire {{is a model of}} the hair dryer 2 ̆ 7 s heater. In the experiment, the effects of the coil diameter D, wire diameter d and coil spacing s of the coiled wire on the aerodynamic sound have been clarified. The results of frequency analyses of the aerodynamic sounds show that an Aeolian sound is generated by the coiled wire, when s/d is larger than I. Also the peak frequencies of Aeolian sounds generated by the <b>coiled</b> <b>wires</b> are higher than the ones generated by a straight cylinder having the same diameter d. To clarify the characteristics of the aerodynamic sound sources, the directivity of the aerodynamic sound generated by the coiled wire has been examined, and the coherent function between the velocity fluctuation around the coiled wire and the aerodynamic sound has been calculated. Moreover, the band overall value of coherent output power between the sound and the velocity fluctuations has been calculated. This method has clarified the sound source region of the Aeolian sound generated by the coiled wire. These results show that the Aeolian sound is generated by the arc part of the coiled wire, which is located in the upstream side of the air-flow...|$|E

The tire design provides greater traction in sandy and/or rocky soil, can operate in microgravity and under harsh conditions (vastly varying temperatures), and is non-pneumatic.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} enhancement {{has been}} always a significantly interesting topic {{in order to}} develop high efficient, low cost, light weight, and small heat exchangers. The energy cost and environmental issue are also encouraging researchers to achieve better performance than the existing designs. Two of the most effective ways to achieve higher heat transfer rate in heat exchangers are using different kinds of inserts and modifying the heat exchanger tubes. There are different kinds of inserts employed in the heat exchanger tubes such as helical/twisted tapes, <b>coiled</b> <b>wires,</b> ribs/fins/baffles, and winglets. This paper presents an overview about the early studies on the improvement of the performance of thermal systems by using different kinds of inserts. Louvered strip insert had better function in backward flow compared to forward one. Modifying the shape of twisted tapes led to a higher efficiency in most of the cases excpet for perforated twisted tape and notched twisted tape. Combination of various inserts and tube with artificial roughness provided promising results. In case of using various propeller types, heat transfer enhancement was dependent on higher number of blades and blade angle and lower pitch ratio...|$|E
40|$|Incorporation of {{metallic}} inductive elements into composites {{introduces a}} new opportunity to tune the overall electromagnetic (EM) properties of such materials over certain frequency ranges. The design can incorporate arrays of straight wire or coiled wire conductors. The straight wires {{must be very}} thin in order to tune the composite to operate within microwave regimes. Coil arrays, on the other hand, can use relatively thick wires. The <b>coiled</b> <b>wires</b> are integrated into the composite within reinforcing braids, where one or more metallic wires are woven with necessary polymer fiber bundles. The coils however introduce chirality in the EM response of the material. In this study we consider two approaches to cancel this chirality effect. One {{is to use a}} 1 - or 2 -D grid of left- and right-handed coils. This does not alter the frequency characteristics of the material, but requires more effort in the arrangement of the two types of coils during manufacturing. Another approach is to use a double coil, with the outer and the inner coils having opposite handedness. This method does not require the extra effort for the arrangement however needs more complex braids. It also shows interesting effects in the dispersion behavior of the material. Both methods will be discussed and some of the simulation results will be presented...|$|E
