50|$|Suppose that a {{customer}} A of a MNO, say MNO O, intends {{to reach a}} subscriber B from a different MNO, T. For this purpose both MNOs have to be interconnected. While in the case assumed, MNO O has to provide an origination service, MNO T terminates the call. Both MNOs usually charge fees for their services, namely the <b>call</b> <b>charge</b> (Z) and the mobile termination rates (MTRs) (t), in order to cover costs. Under the Calling Party Pays (CPP) principle, MNO T charges MNO O a MTR which O passes on {{to his or her}} own subscriber in full, in addition to the <b>call</b> <b>charge.</b> In contrast, under Receiving Party Pays (RPP), subscribers of MNO O have to pay for origination services only, while the recipient in MNO T is charged (by T) for the termination service.|$|E

It followed on from the success of Demon Internet's Point of Presence (PoP) in Hull. This was set up with the initial formation of Demon in June 1992. Demon allowed users in Hull to make untimed 5.5p+vat calls to access the Internet via dialup accounts. Karoo followed on a few years after Demon removed their local PoP. Karoo Xtra allowed Kingston Communications customers untimed access for the price of a 5.5p (+ VAT) <b>call</b> <b>charge</b> (and a subscription fee of £15 per month).|$|E
50|$|On 1 July 2015, Ofcom made {{a number}} of changes to the way phone calls to UK service numbers would be charged. Under the new legislation, which was {{promoted}} by an information campaign entitled UK Calling, <b>call</b> <b>charges</b> must be clearly stated on all materials that advertise a service number. The changes came after research found that callers are often confused about service <b>call</b> <b>charges,</b> and thus can avoid calling these numbers.

The charge for printing out the ticket at home is often higher than the fee to have the ticket mailed. In other sectors, such as airline ticketing, companies usually do not charge (and in some cases even offer a discount), for electronic ticketing. Economist Emily Oster of the Chicago Booth School of Business suggests that this reflects the lack of competition in the industry, with customers {{willing to pay more}} for the convenience of obtaining the tickets immediately {{due to a lack of}} alternate options.|$|E
50|$|Premium-rate {{telephone}} numbers are {{telephone numbers}} for telephone calls during which certain services are provided, {{and for which}} prices higher than normal are charged. Unlike a normal call, part of the <b>call</b> <b>charge</b> is paid to the service provider, thus enabling businesses to be funded via the calls. While the billing is different, calls are usually routed {{the same way they}} are for a toll-free telephone number, being anywhere despite the area code used. These telephone numbers are usually allocated from a national telephone numbering plan {{in such a way that}} they are easily distinguished from other numbers. Telephone companies typically offer blocking services to allow telephone customers to prevent access to these number ranges from their telephones. In some jurisdictions, telephone companies are required by law to offer such blocking.|$|E

The system is capable of preparing large-scale and complex network tests by viewing the task as a scheduling problem. The various requirements of the scheduling problem are analysed and represented as constraints or optimisation criteria. A fast heuristic method is proposed for solving the problem. The approach is based on a greedy algorithm for constructing solutions and it incorporates limited backtracking and dynamic value-ordering heuristics. The algorithm and system are currently being used for <b>call</b> <b>charge</b> verification in BT's PSTN and CSP networks...|$|E
