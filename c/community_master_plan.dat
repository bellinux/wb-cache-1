40|$|Applied ecology {{has been}} used to design {{communities}} around the world; however suburban neighborhoods in west central Florida do not usually utilize existing or potential ecological function as a modeling parameter or success measure. Since the end of the great depression, developments in the Tampa Bay Area have displaced many wetland and upland natural communities. Private ownership and development of sensitive natural lands have restricted their use and hampered the functional longevity of important ecological systems in this area. These displaced areas have historically functioned as habitat for many types of animal life, have passively conveyed nutrient loads, and have facilitated the succession of organisms. They have also been used as recreational opportunities for local residents and visitors, children and adults. Applied ecological design usually occurs at a <b>community</b> or <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> scale, or separately at a singular building level, but rarely both simultaneously. This design proposal was the investigation and formation of an ecocentric architectural design methodology for coastal environments; from <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> to conceptual building design. The scope was the synthesis of a recreational tourism facility with the existing ecological communities of Rattlesnake Key, a barrier island in northwest Manatee County, Florida. The program included an ecological education center, where visitors could learn about their relationship with the ecological communities present on the island, and a group of cabins, where inhabitants could interact with each other and the surrounding natural <b>communities</b> intimately. <b>Master</b> <b>planning</b> strategies were outlined using extensive ecological mapping overlays, in-field observation, and feasibility analysis. Building forms, means of construction, and structural systems were created by integrating biomimicry methods, habitat restoration techniques, and sustainable practices into a programmed, built environment. The results of the investigation were a series of physical models and graphic representations of spaces that manifest the sensitive relationship between human inhabitance and ecological function; where both processes coexist and support the longevity and persistence of one another through habitat creation. By analyzing the existing ecological functions present on a site, a designer could propose a typology that strengthens the relationship between man and his environment; where development is no longer displacement...|$|R

The intent was to prepare and experiment with long term planning to remedy the problem of severely deteriorated employee housing units that exists as a national issue with many BIA agency structures. The average age of housing for employees at the pilot project location was 72 years old, many with health hazards such as lead, asbestos, mold and radon issues to varying degrees of severity. The issues {{have been identified in}} a Department of the Interior, Inspector General Report that was made publicly available in September 2016, showing problems with communication, collaboration and maintenance as interconnected. I was the volunteer intern Junior Program Analyst put in charge of the pilot project in June 2016, tasked with developing the planning document and the process that would create it. Through the three months I worked as a volunteer intern, I developed this new method in collaboration with the GPRO DoF, BIA local Agency, Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), and the local Office of Justice Services (OJS). The resulting process was a translation of a small town <b>master</b> <b>planning</b> process, shifting the perspective of the location from just an agency with staff and structures to be managed to that of a community comprised of local experts. This planning model based itself upon four key points; •	Communities are comprised of local experts that are more knowledgeable about their community strengths and weaknesses than others •	Collaboration and two-way communication strengthens all stakeholders and leads to long term improvements •	Community development and improvement increases employee retention •	The planning process develops long term planning that is aware of the abilities and limitations present in a community, and capital improvement plans are thus more effectively created to reflect what is reasonable for the unique situation present at that community. The planning process developed through the pilot project has the potential to create long term improvements to agency locations and reconnect the various stakeholders through improved collaboration and communication, but it has its own limitations as well. The effort requires a full-time planner to develop and continually manage the plans, especially as new ones are developed and existing ones are implemented. It is critical to have this position, as the individual not only creates the plans but monitors the progress of plan alignment, maintains as the point of contact for stakeholders and facilitates the plan development and revision processes.

However, these types of forest programs require both that the community is involved in {{various aspects of the}} decision-making process, and that the community benefits economically, recreationally, and/or educationally. McIntosh SEED, a grassroots nonprofit organization, purchased 1, 159 acres of land situated in the coastal flatwoods of Georgia, with the goal of designating it as the McIntosh SEED Community Forest. The primary objective of this project is the development of The McIntosh SEED <b>Community</b> Forest <b>Master</b> <b>Plan,</b> which plays a crucial role in achieving their vision for the forest. The plan consists of three parts; the first involves an analysis of the community’s interests in relation to the forest using a combination of focus groups, interviews, and surveys.

The third and final part is also multi-faceted and moves beyond the site itself, addressing community accessibility and key communication and funding strategies. The community access assessment included a service area and competitive landscape analysis. As a case study, this process is applicable to the development of future community forests.

40|$|Master of Landscape ArchitectureDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional and Community PlanningMary C. Kingery-PageThe landscapes that {{surround}} our elementary schools today do {{very little to}} support the education being taught in the classrooms, and often fail to meet the most basic needs of children. This {{is due to a}} myriad of different reasons, such as budget-tight school districts spending very little of their resources on outside learning environments, fear of litigation leading to sterile and lifeless schoolyards, and lack of time and resources for educators to implement desired changes. Children learn through direct interactive experience and, as a result, they need complexity and variety in the landscape to stimulate their imaginations and promote self-guided learning. A natural outdoor environment is ideally suited for both interactive learning and a diversity of experiences. Many schools are missing an opportunity to make their outdoor spaces into interactive learning environments. This report explores the issues and opportunities to create stimulating environments at Frank V. Bergman Elementary School in Manhattan, Kansas. Numerous studies have identified the benefits of interactive natural environments on children’s development and academic performance(Moore and Wong 1997; Louv 2008; Bell and Dyment 2006;Fjortoft 2001; Malone and Tranter 2003).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an integrated}} community safety approach to creating safer communities. It defines community broadly to include {{two categories of}} community members: “industry” and “neighbors. ” Potential community members within the “industry” category include facilities, government/regulators, customers, stockholders, and suppliers. Within the “neighbors” category are towns, cities, counties, states; people/commodity flow systems; news media and special interest groups; environment; and families of employees. Each of these potential community members and its characteristics are discussed. The integrated community safety approach consists of three major activities: (1) define {{the boundaries of the}} community; (2) facilitate the sense of community; and (3) address the needs of the community. Defining the boundaries of the community includes determining the geographical and social boundaries; this is accomplished through conducting a hazard analysis and community involvement to identify all of the community members. Facilitating the sense of community includes conducting a capability/needs assessment and continuing community involvement to identify the issues and concerns of community members. Addressing the needs of the <b>community</b> involves <b>master</b> <b>planning</b> to consider safety issues in all community development actions and continuing community education and involvement. The integrated community safety approach is a workable approach for existing industries and their neighbors as well as new projects that industries and their neighbors might be considering. By using this socio-technical approach to integrating industry and all of its neighbors into a safer community, the integrated community safety approach will better assure the viability and safety of industry and its neighbors while maintaining or improving the overall quality of life...|$|R

40|$|Many of our commuities are deteriorating. The {{places in}} which we live are lacking {{character}} and commitment to healthy lifestyles. Our lives revolve around a fast-paced society dependant upon the automobile. Luckily, the design solutions for many of these troubling contemporary issues {{can be found in the}} greenway design principles introduced by some of the earliest and most well known landscape architects in this country. It is the job of designers to improve the health of our society through quality recreation design, and it is at the community level that a collaborative team of professionals can make the greatest impact on human lives. This project re-evaluates and re-defines the diverse roles of landscape architects in designing multiple types of greenways as transportation routes, sources of community identity, and places of healing. Greenway design has been implicit to landscape architecture since the inception of the profession over 100 years ago. Frederick Law Olmstead first introduced the term in his <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> for the campus at Cal-Berkley, and through his design for the Emerald Necklace. Olmstead's theories on greenways as healing environments have been improved upon on different levels by Ebenezer Howard's greenbelt plan at the community level, and by Benton MacKaye's conceptual plan for the Appalachian Trail at the regional scale. Contemporary designers have further evolved the greenway ideal in the reclamation of old rail beds for adaptive reuse as pedestrian corridors. This study applied the historical background and relevant theory on greenway design to a specific "trail town" community in the borough of Meyersdale, Pennsylvania that will serve as a prototype for other similar communities along abandoned rail beds. The plan focuses on an uncompleted piece of the Allegheny Greenway Trail connecting Pittsburgh to Washington D. C., and running through Meyersdale. In addition, the design solution takes into account recreation and transportation plans for the community and its tourists in order to provide the framework for the beginnings of a healthy <b>community.</b> The <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> will serve as a case study to be applied to similar communities across the country, setting new precedents for greenway design, and inspiring community members to a new appreciation of their own community.
