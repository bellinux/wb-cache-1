25|$|It {{should be}} remembered, however, {{that health care}} {{professionals}} will often still include a pulse <b>check</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> ABC <b>check,</b> and may involve additional steps such as an immediate ECG when cardiac arrest is suspected, {{in order to assess}} heart rhythm.|$|R
50|$|Gate {{checking}} {{refers to}} the practice that allows passengers <b>check</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> bags directly at the gate. Gate checking is mostly used on small planes when there isn’t enough space to take on board the cabin bags of all passengers.|$|R

This may involve passengers <b>checking</b> <b>in</b> online before arriving at the airport or using an airline's self-service check-in kiosks at the airport. Some airports have curbside check-in, where passengers can <b>check</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> bags to an airline representative before entering the terminal and then proceeding directly to security.|$|R

It was located on Cromwell Road in Kensington, London {{and was in}} operation from 6 October 1957 to 1 January 1974. After passengers <b>checked</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> baggage and received their boarding passes, they would travel to Heathrow Airport by coach. One of the drawbacks of using the terminal for <b>checking</b> <b>in</b> was that road traffic could delay the coaches and ultimately delay {{the departure of the}} flight.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} JUnit test runner that informs users of miss-ing {{behavior}} <b>checks</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> tests. The tool tracks variable updates and definitions {{over the course}} of a test execution and determines which variables influence which assertions via dynamic taint analysis. The program statements that set outputs which do not influence the outcome of any test assertions are reported as state coverage inadequacies. With traditional code coverage tools, users can ensure that tests execute all program statements; with this tool, they can ad-ditionally ensure that program output is <b>checked,</b> <b>in</b> one way or another, by a test...|$|R

This non-destructive method allows surfaces to be tested without preparation, and the quality of polish and finish of tooth or dental restoration to be <b>checked</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> actual aspect. A comparison with S. E. M. method is also presented. © 1985 SPIE. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5000|$|Several {{developers}} {{may work}} on the same project concurrently, each one editing files within their own [...] "working copy" [...] of the project, and sending (or <b>checking</b> <b>in)</b> <b>their</b> modifications to the server. To avoid conflicts, the server only accepts changes made {{to the most recent}} version of a file. Developers are therefore expected to keep their working copy up-to-date by incorporating other people's changes on a regular basis. This task is mostly handled automatically by the CVS client, requiring manual intervention only when an edit conflict arises between a checked-in modification and the yet-unchecked local version of a file.|$|R
60|$|The teller was shovelling golden sovereigns {{into a pair}} {{of scales}} with a brass shovel as coolly {{as if he were a}} grocer's boy {{scooping}} out raw sugar.

She was mistaken. They were <b>checked</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> career by a ledge, and lay before her unbelieving eyes in a glittering mass.|$|R
