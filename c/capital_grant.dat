5|$|The {{construction}} of the venue cost NOK230 million, which was almost entirely financed through state grants. Hamar Municipality contributed by building a co-located fire station for NOK21 million. Local businesses also contributed with NOK8 million. Moelven Industrier and Fireguard both contributed in exchange {{for being able to}} use the venues for marketing large wooden structures. To finance the operating deficit after the Olympics, Hamar Municipality received a <b>capital</b> <b>grant</b> of NOK30 million, with the interest going to pay for running Vikingskipet and Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre. Operating costs were estimated at NOK7 million per year; the venue will receive income of NOK1 million from larger events, NOK1 million will come from free work from the fire department, and NOK1 million from advertisements. Similar to Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, the venue has two official names, Hamar Olympic Hall and Vikingskipet. The former cannot be used commercially by non-Olympic events, such as in merchandise.|$|E

40|$|This paper takes {{stock of}} the last 80 years of {{theoretical}} and policy literature {{on the issue of}} <b>capital</b> <b>grants.</b> In addition, we provide empirical evidence on changes in the relative importance of <b>capital</b> <b>grants,</b> and their impact on fiscal outcomes for a large number of countries. In particular, our empirical analysis explores two claims often used to justify <b>capital</b> <b>grants</b> in practice: 1) Due to political economy reasons, local governments tend to underinvest relative to the level desired by the national government. We test this claim by comparing the propensity to invest of subnational vis-à-vis national governments. 2) The administrative and efficiency costs of earmarking <b>grants</b> for <b>capital</b> use are justified by their effect of inducing additional investments by subnational governments. We test this claim by comparing the propensity to invest of local governments out of <b>capital</b> <b>grants</b> compared to their propensity to invest out of general purpose (non-earmarked) grants and own resources...|$|R

However, the proposed runway extension would have required infill and the erection of gantries across part of the adjacent protected beach. The plan drew much local criticism and almost 400 objections from residents of the local area, fisheries groups, the Department of Environment, An Taisce and Birdwatch Ireland. The planning permission was quashed on the third attempt by a high court judge on justification grounds.|$|E

Until 1991, general county offices were still housed in the courthouse though the courts had moved to new facilities a few blocks away. In 2002 McLean County approved $1.2 million for renovation following a historic structures report. Other funding came through a Public Museum <b>Capital</b> <b>Grant</b> from the Illinois State Museum, {{a division of the}} Illinois Department of Natural Resources. The project included restoration of the 100-year-old courthouse dome. Original copper was salvaged and reused and the clock restored to working order.

25|$|As {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of the key recommendations of the Murray report, the federal government established the Australian Universities Commission (AUC) in 1959, appointing Sir Leslie Martin as its chair. Menzies appointed Martin to chair a special committee in 1961 to report to the AUC on the rapidly increasing demands for higher education in Australia. In August 1963 it released its second report, which recognised the urgency of Victoria's situation '…the resources of Melbourne and Monash Universities are not likely to meet the long-term demands for university education beyond 1966. The Commission therefore is willing to support in the 1964–1966 triennium the extension of university facilities in the Melbourne metropolitan area.' Following the recommendations the federal government passed the Universities Assistance Bill in October 1963, providing a grant for a 'third' university for recurrent expenditure in 1965 of $106,000 and $210,000 in 1966. The first <b>capital</b> <b>grant</b> was for 1966 and amounted to $1,000,000. These grants were to be matched by equivalent state grants.|$|E

40|$|The aim of <b>capital</b> <b>grants</b> to {{subcentral}} governments is {{to increase}} their investment. However, recipients may try to allocate additional resources to cut saving or deficit, generating a crowding-out effect on self-financed investment. Using data from the Spanish Autonomous Communities during the period 1984 to 1999, the effect of capital transfers on regional public investment, saving and deficit are estimated. Econometric results demonstrate that <b>capital</b> <b>grants</b> have no relevance when explaining the dynamics of saving. However, in deficit regressions they are shown to be both significant and negative. Both results lead us to a partial long-run crowding-out effect of grants on self-financed investment. ...|$|R
