50|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the effectiveness of diphtheria antiserum, a stable concentration of diphtheria toxin was required. Ehrlich discovered that the toxin being used was perishable, in contrast to what had been assumed, which for him led to two consequences: He did not use the toxin as a standard, but instead a serum powder developed by Behring, which had to be dissolved in liquid shortly before use. The strength of a test toxin was first determined in comparison with this standard. The test toxin could then be used as a reference for testing other serums. For the test itself, toxin and serum were mixed in a ratio so that their effects just cancelled each other when injected into a guinea pig. But since there was a large margin in determining whether symptoms of illness were present, Ehrlich established an unambiguous target: the death of the animal. The mixture was to be such that the test animal would die after four days. If it died earlier, the serum was too weak and was rejected.

These factors, combined with high protein consumption, have limited the adoption of <b>chemical</b> denaturant <b>titrations</b> in commercial settings. Thermal denaturation assays can be automated, sometimes with very high throughput. However, thermal denaturation assays are incompatible with proteins that aggregate at high temperatures and large extrapolation of stability parameters to physiological temperatures can introduce significant uncertainties. We used capillary-based instruments to measure <b>chemical</b> denaturant <b>titrations</b> by intrinsic fluorescence and microscale thermophoresis. This allowed higher throughput, consumed several hundred-fold less protein than conventional, cuvette-based methods yet maintained the high quality of the conventional approaches. We also established efficient strategies for automated, direct determination of protein stability at a range of temperatures via chemical denaturation, which has utility for characterising stability for proteins that are difficult to purify in high yield. This approach may also have merit for proteins that irreversibly denature or aggregate in classical thermal denaturation assays. We also developed procedures for affinity ranking of protein–ligand interactions from ligand-induced changes in chemical denaturation data, and proved the principle for this by correctly ranking the affinity of previously unreported peptide–PDZ domain interactions. The increased throughput, automation and low protein consumption of protein stability determinations afforded by using capillary-based methods to measure denaturant titrations, can help to revolutionise protein research.

Among all the available processes, magnetic separation is considered as a promising technique (Safarikova et al. 1999). Magnetic alginate microcapsules containing an active substance have been studied for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants. Alginate is a natural polysaccharide produced by brown algae. As a supporting material, it offers advantages in term of biocompatibility, simplicity and low cost. Magnetic nanoparticles of ΓFe 2 O 3 are entrapped by the gelation reaction within the alginate matrix. Their presence allows the separation of the microcapsules from the aqueous phase by applying a magnetic field. Depending on the targeted pollutant, two different active substances are also encapsulated in the magnetic microcapsules : activated carbon for organic pollutants and cyanex 272 (bis (2, 4, 4 - trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid) for inorganic pollutants (Bée et al. 2006). The morphology of the microcapsules was assessed from optical and electronic microscope observations. Combined with BET experiments and <b>chemical</b> <b>titrations</b> of the content of the microcapsules, these observations help to understand the macro- and microstructure of our system. To test the extraction ability of the microcapsules, adsorption and kinetics experiments have been performed with organic dyes and inorganic ions.

This thesis involves studies that look specifically at the effects of electronic doping and trap reduction in undoped and Mn 2 + -doped QDs. Investigation of the effect of electron-Mn 2 + exchange interactions on Mn 2 + luminescence in Mn 2 + :CdS nanocrystal films through an electrochemical method reveals effective Auger de-excitation of photoexcited Mn 2 +. The doped QDs demonstrate increased sensitivity to Auger de-excitation versus undoped QDs due to the long lifetime of the Mn 2 + excited state. Photochemical electronic doping of colloidal CdSe nanocrystals is achieved for the first time through the use of a borohydride hole quencher, Li[Et 3 BH], and the high spectroscopic quality of the resulting n -type nanocrystals allows for advanced characterization by absorption and photoluminescence.

Fat tissue samples were removed from the anterior tip of the jowl and posterior to the sternum on the belly edge 1 d postmortem. Fatty acid composition was determined via the Folch method and IVs were calculated from <b>chemical</b> <b>titrations,</b> fatty acid profile (GC IV) and in-plant Bruker® near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Correlations between IV determination methods were calculated. Inclusion of 20 % DDGS did not change (P > 0. 05) growth performance while marketing cut affected performance with the second cut producing the heaviest and most efficient hogs (P < 0. 01). Total SFA and MUFA concentrations were higher (P < 0. 01) in belly and jowl fat from hogs fed 0 % DDGS. Total PUFA and the PUFA:SFA in belly and jowl fat was higher (P < 0. 01) when 20 % DDGS was fed. DDGS inclusion increased IV in belly and jowl fat regardless of IV determination method. Regardless of dietary treatment or fat depot, Pearson Correlation Coefficients between titration and GC IV, titration and NIR, and GC IV and NIR were 0. 46 (P < 0. 01), 0. 68 (P < 0. 01) and 0. 43 (P < 0. 01), respectively. These correlations suggest methods may rank samples equally, but do not provide the same absolute IV. Belly fat had a loweIncludes bibliographical references (pages 66 - 78) ...|$|R
