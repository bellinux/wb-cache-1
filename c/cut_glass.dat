25|$|In November 1953 Linstead was {{inadvertently}} {{the cause}} of some political difficulties to the Conservative government. He moved a motion to annul an Order in Council which lifted an embargo on <b>cut</b> <b>glass</b> imports, arguing that {{to do so would}} damage the domestic industry. After debate he intended to withdraw the motion, but the Labour opposition (which wanted to continue the embargo) objected and put the motion to the vote; with the Conservative whips not expecting a division, they lost by four votes. This was the first vote which the government had lost.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of complete vessels and assemblages of beads {{come from the}} excavations of early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, but a change in burial rites in the late 7th century affected the recovery of glass, as Christian Anglo-Saxons were buried with fewer grave goods, and glass is rarely found. From the late 7th century onwards, window glass is found more frequently. This {{is directly related to}} the introduction of Christianity and the construction of churches and monasteries. There are a few Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical literary sources that mention the production and use of glass, although these relate to window glass used in ecclesiastical buildings. Glass was also used by the Anglo-Saxons in their jewellery, both as enamel or as <b>cut</b> <b>glass</b> insets.|$|E

25|$|The Near East has, since Roman times, been {{recognized}} as a center of quality glassware and crystal. 9th century finds from Samarra show styles similar to Sassanian forms. The types of objects made were bottles, flasks, vases, and cups utilized for domestic use. Decorations on these domestic items include molded flutes, honeycomb patters, and inscriptions. Other styles seen {{that may not have}} come from the Sassanians were stamped items. These were typically round stamps, such as medallions or disks with animals, birds, or Kufic inscriptions. Colored lead glass, typically blue or green, have been found in Nishapur, along with prismatic perfume bottles. Finally, <b>cut</b> <b>glass</b> may have been the high point of Abbasid glass-working, decorated with floral and animal designs.|$|E
25|$|At this period, {{glass was}} sold by weight, and the typical forms were rather heavy and solid with minimal decoration. Such was its {{success on the}} {{international}} market, however, that in 1746, the British Government imposed a lucrative tax by weight. Rather than drastically reduce the lead content of their glass, manufacturers responded by creating highly decorated, smaller, more delicate forms, often with hollow stems, known to collectors today as Excise glasses. In 1780, the Government granted Ireland free trade in glass without taxation. English labour and capital then shifted to Dublin and Belfast, and new glassworks specialising in <b>cut</b> <b>glass</b> were installed in Cork and Waterford. In 1825, the tax was renewed, and gradually the industry declined until the mid-nineteenth century, when the tax was finally repealed.|$|E
500|$|The Lalitha Mahal Palace {{was built}} in 1921 by E.W. Fritchley under the {{commission}} of Maharaja Krishnaraja IV. The architectural style is called [...] "Renaissance" [...] and exhibits concepts from English manor houses and Italian palazzos. The central dome {{is believed to be}} modelled on St. Paul's Cathedral in London. Other important features are the Italian marble staircase, the polished wooden flooring in the banquet and dance halls, and the Belgian <b>cut</b> <b>glass</b> lamps. The Jaganmohan Palace was commissioned in 1861 and was completed in 1910. The three-storeyed building with attractive domes, finials and cupolas was the venue of many a royal celebration. It is now called the Chamarajendra Art Gallery and houses a rich collection of artifacts.|$|E

500|$|Diamonds can be {{identified}} by their high thermal conductivity. Their high refractive index is also indicative, but other materials have similar refractivity. Diamonds <b>cut</b> <b>glass,</b> {{but this does not}} positively identify a diamond because other materials, such as quartz, also lie above glass on the Mohs scale and can also cut it. Diamonds can scratch other diamonds, but this can result in damage to one or both stones. Hardness tests are infrequently used in practical gemology because of their potentially destructive nature. The extreme hardness and high value of diamond means that gems are typically polished slowly, using painstaking traditional techniques and greater attention to detail than is the case with most other gemstones; these tend to result in extremely flat, highly polished facets with exceptionally sharp facet edges. Diamonds also possess an extremely high refractive index and fairly high dispersion. Taken together, these factors affect the overall appearance of a polished diamond and most diamantaires still rely upon skilled use of a loupe (magnifying glass) to identify diamonds [...] "by eye".|$|E

Around the room are Corinthian pilasters and {{on each of the}} shorter walls is a massive mirror. In the south wall is a niche for musicians, over which is a coffered semi-dome; on each side of this is a white marble chimneypiece. [...] Hanging from the ceiling are [...] "three of the finest Georgian chandeliers in Europe"; each is [...] high, contains 20,000pieces of <b>cut</b> <b>glass</b> crystal, and weighs over one ton. They were made in Staffordshire in 1820. The floor is a maple sprung dance floor. [...] Most of {{the east side of the}} hall is occupied by the Small Ballroom, also known as the East Reception Room or Music Room. This room is surrounded by pilasters and at each end is a shallow apse; the apse in the north wall has two niches for musicians. Suspended from the ceiling are three 19th century chandeliers. [...] Completing the circuit is the East Reception Room, similar in style to the West Reception Room. [...] The rooms contain a number of portraits; one of these is of James Maury, America's first consul.|$|E

Using {{patterns}} created from the original designs, these women selected and <b>cut</b> the <b>glass</b> {{to be used in the}} famous lamps.

2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of his career, Tiffany used cheap jelly jars and bottles because they had the mineral impurities that finer glass lacked. When he was unable to convince fine glassmakers to leave the impurities in, he began making his own glass. Tiffany used opalescent glass in a variety of colors and textures to create a unique style of stained glass. He developed the [...] "copper foil" [...] technique, which, by edging each piece of <b>cut</b> <b>glass</b> in copper foil and soldering the whole together to create his windows and lamps, made possible a level of detail previously unknown. This can be contrasted with the method of painting in enamels or glass paint on colorless glass, and then setting the glass pieces in lead channels, that had been the dominant method of creating stained glass for hundreds of years in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Few {{records have}} survived from Francisco's time at Locust Grove. [...] The little {{information}} that remains {{suggests that the}} farm was typical of those found around Virginia {{at the turn of}} the nineteenth century. [...] A personal property tax inventory taken in 1815 indicates the presence in the household of seven slaves over twelve years old and one between nine and twelve, as well as six horses and twelve head of cattle. [...] No carriage, watch, clock, or mahogany furniture was found, but the house's occupants were taxed for a mirror with gilded frame, two goblets made of <b>cut</b> <b>glass,</b> three pictures, and an unknown number of small gilt frames. [...] This record indicates that, while Francisco was not among the Virginia gentry, he was most probably among the better-off residents of the county at the time.|$|E
60|$|We {{know that}} <b>cut</b> <b>glass</b> is expensive, {{and the reason}} is that cutting it is a slow process. Four wheels have to be used in succession, iron, sandstone, wood, and cork. Sand is thrown upon these wheels {{in such a way that}} the glass is finely and delicately cut. But this is imitated in pressed glass, which is blown in a mould inside of which the design is cut. This is much cheaper than the <b>cut</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
