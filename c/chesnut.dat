25|$|The Longhorns {{came into}} Lincoln, Nebraska as the 16th {{best team in}} the country and one year removed from being in the College World Series. The Longhorns were the heavy {{favorite}} heading into the weekend series but found themselves down in the series after being defeated Friday night by the Huskers. In front of a crowd of 5,852, the Husker's made history. The Husker pitching staff combined for 19 strikeouts, 3 walks, 4 hits, 210 pitches thrown and 15 innings of work. The impressive part about this stat line wouldn't of even been noticed unless you attended the game. The Husker pitching staff threw 9 innings of no-hit baseball during this 15 inning marathon. From the 4th inning to the 14th inning, the Longhorns were unable to record a single hit off the Husker pitching staff of Kyle Kubat, Jake Hohensee, Colton Howell and Jeff <b>Chesnut.</b> These four pitchers were honored with the Louisville Slugger National Players of the week award; {{for the first time in}} NCAA history, this award was given to four pitchers from the same school, in the same week.

25|$|The Santa Muerte cult {{established}} {{itself in}} the United States circa 2005, brought to the country by Mexican and Central American migrants. By 2012, <b>Chesnut</b> suggested that there were {{tens of thousands of}} devotees in the U.S., This cult is primarily visible in cities with high populations, such as New York City, Chicago, Houston, San Antonio, Tucson, and Los Angeles, although it has also been located in cities with small Latino communities like Richmond, Virginia. There are fifteen religious groups dedicated to her in Los Angeles alone, which include the Temple of Santa Muerte.|$|E
25|$|Shrines {{can also}} be found in the back of all kinds of stores and gas stations. As veneration of Santa Muerte becomes more accepted, stores specializing in {{religious}} articles, such as botánicas, are carrying more and more paraphernalia related to the cult. Historian R. Andrew <b>Chesnut</b> has discovered that many botanicas in both Mexico and the U.S. are kept in business by sales of Santa Muerte paraphernalia, with numerous shops earning up to half of their profits on Santa Muerte items. This is true even of stores in very well known locations such as Pasaje Catedral behind the Mexico City Cathedral, which is mostly dedicated to store selling Catholic liturgical items. Her image is a staple in esoterica shops.|$|E

25|$|During {{the revolutionary}} period {{expensive}} theatrical entertainments were prohibited, except {{during the time}} of the British occupation, and the ban remained in effect until 1789. After the ban was lifted, Philadelphia became one of the nation's main theatrical centers. The New American Company, founded in 1792 by Reinagle and Thomas Wignell, recruited a large number of singers and composers from England. Although the principal repertory was from London, several composers who lived in Philadelphia wrote original operas; among the most successful were Carr's The Archers (1796), Reinagle's The Volunteers (1795), and Taylor's The Aethiop (1814). Of prime importance to the success of opera was the construction in 1793 of the New Theatre (later known as the Chestnut or <b>Chesnut</b> Street Theatre), by Reinagle and Wignell. Taylor and Carr also worked at the New Theatre which was the most splendid theatre in the United States in its day. The building seated nearly 2000 people, and its design was based on the Theatre Royal, Bath in England.|$|E
25|$|The {{stalemate}} {{was broken}} {{by the arrival of}} the Union brigade under Brig. Gen. George A. Custer. He deployed his 5th Michigan on the right of Bottoms Bridge Road, the 1st and 7th Michigan on the left, and the 6th Michigan in reserve. Their attack flanked the Confederates on both ends of the line. As Butler's men fled to the rear, his reserve regiment, the 7th South Carolina, counterattacked in an attempt to maintain the line. The superior Union numbers and firepowerthe Michiganders were armed with Spencer repeating rifles and Torbert had deployed horse artillery, a weapon that Butler did not have availablecarried the day. Although almost all the fighting in the battle was dismounted, Col. Frank A. Haskell and Maj. Edward M. Boykin (cousin of the famous Confederate diarist, Mary <b>Chesnut)</b> led the 7th on horseback, and both were severely wounded during the charge. The 20th Georgia Battalion arrived {{at the end of the}} battle and were almost swamped by their colleagues racing away on horseback. The Union troopers pursued the retreating Confederates with enthusiasm. Butler eventually rallied his men at Old Cold Harbor and Torbert's men bivouacked about 1.5 miles northeast of the intersection.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the power}} {{relationships}} at work, slave women in the United States were {{at high risk for}} rape and sexual abuse. Many slaves fought back against sexual attacks, and some died resisting. Others carried psychological and physical scars from the attacks. Sexual abuse of slaves was partially rooted in a patriarchal Southern culture which treated black women as property or chattel. Southern culture strongly policed against sexual relations between white women and black men on the purported grounds of racial purity but, by the late 18th century, the many mixed-race slaves and slave children showed that white men had often taken advantage of slave women. Wealthy planter widowers, notably such as John Wayles and his son-in-law Thomas Jefferson, took slave women as concubines; each had six children with his partner: Elizabeth Hemings and her daughter Sally Hemings (the half-sister of Jefferson's late wife), respectively. Both Mary <b>Chesnut</b> and Fanny Kemble, wives of planters, wrote about this issue in the antebellum South in the decades before the Civil War. Sometimes planters used mixed-race slaves as house servants or favored artisans because they were their children or other relatives. As a result of centuries of slavery and such relationships, DNA {{studies have shown that the}} vast majority of African Americans also have historic European ancestry, generally through paternal lines.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{painters}} {{are also}} inspired by El Greco's art.

The laurels, maples, and deciduous-leaved oaks, hydrangea and cherry, were leafless, but the abundance of <b>chesnuts</b> and evergreen oaks, rhododendrons, Aucuba, Linonia, and other shrubs, kept the forest well clothed.

5000|$|<b>Chesnut's</b> {{reputation}} {{rests on}} the fact that she created literature while keeping the sense of events unfolding; she described people in penetrating and enlivening terms and conveyed a novelistic sense of events through a [...] "mixture of reportage, memoir and social criticism".

500|$|Literary reviews were {{generally}} positive, while historians were often critical of Brodie's speculations.Wills complained that Brodie had consistently found double meanings {{in the language}} of colonial America based on twentieth-century usage.New York Review of Books, 21 (April 18, 1974), 26. Mainstream historians had long denied the possibility of Jefferson's relation with Sally Hemings, although such interracial liaisons were so common that by the late eighteenth century, visitors remarked on the numerous white slaves in Virginia and the Upper South. [...] "The Richmond Examiner on September 25, 1802, in a rare admission, stated that “thousands” of mulatto children were then being born in the South." [...] Mary <b>Chesnut</b> and Fanny Kemble, educated women of the planter elite, also wrote about many interracial families in the era shortly before the American Civil War.

50|$|Kemble did not publish {{her account}} until 1863, long after their divorce in 1849 and after her daughters had reached their majority. According to the {{historian}} Catherine Clinton, King Jr.'s granddaughter, Julia King, {{wrote to a}} friend in 1930, saying that Kemble had told lies about her grandfather because he refused to return her affections. The historian Bell documented that the marriage of Kemble and Pierce Butler was fraught with conflict by that time, and was undermined by episodes of spousal infidelity. It ended in separation in 1847 and divorce in 1849. But, Kemble's observing that white planters and managers had mixed-race children with slave women was consistent with other reports of the times, such as Mary <b>Chesnut's</b> diary of the Civil War era, and numerous other accounts.|$|R
5000|$|The expressionists {{focused on}} the {{expressive}} distortions of El Greco. According to Franz Marc, {{one of the principal}} painters of the German expressionist movement, [...] "we refer with pleasure and with steadfastness to the case of El Greco, because the glory of this painter is closely tied to the evolution of our new perceptions on art". Jackson Pollock, a major force in the abstract expressionist movement, was also influenced by El Greco. By 1943, Pollock had completed sixty drawing compositions after El Greco and owned three books on the Cretan master.Contemporary painters are also inspired by El Greco's art.

In 1883 Boggiani exhibited six paintings {{for the first time in}} Palazzo delle Belle Arti (Rome). Among these were La raccolta delle castagne (Gathering of <b>Chesnuts)</b> and Scogli di Sant'Anna. His painting La raccolta delle castagne was acquired by the National Museum of Modern Art in Rome for about 6,000 pounds, a price considered high at that time. At the 1887 Exhibition in Venice, he displayed Gli ulivi a Francavilla al Mare; Sentiero a Lago Maggiore, Villaggio sul Lago Maggiore, and Ortensie.|$|R
