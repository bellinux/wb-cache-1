40|$|Abstract. Three-dimensional (3 D) {{defects in}} {{nanostructures}} seem to play crucial {{influence on their}} properties. Twinnings {{are the most popular}} 3 D defects in II-VI semiconductor compounds having zinc-blende structure (Zn, Cd chalcogenides). These defects are of { 111 } type. Electron diffraction of such defected crystals as well as nanostructures (thin layers, clusters and other nanoscale individuals) results in satellite spots placed around the main single <b>crystal</b> <b>spots</b> in diffraction pattern. This is due to the different orientation of the matrix and twins of the first and higher orders with respect to the electron beam. Basing on a reciprocal lattice of twinned structure, the interpretation of nature of satellite spots is addressed. The double positioning, primary and double diffraction were described. The considerations were applied to the nanostructured epitaxial CdTe and Hg 1 -xCdxTe layers obtained by laser deposition...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{software}} developed for automated processing of 2 D powder diffraction data-sets as for instance acquired {{with an image}} plate setup. For structural analysis, such 2 D data usually is integrated to 2 θ-scan powder diffraction patterns. Our software is capable to automate such integrations including a geometry correction and automated masking of intensities pixels not resulting from the powder sample (beam stop shadow, single <b>crystal</b> <b>spots</b> etc.). The intensity uncertainty assigned to each 2 θ-bin {{is assumed to be}} given by the uncertainty of a Poissondistributed quantity. The integrated data-sets may be directly output to files readable by the Rietveld packages GSAS or FullProf. Furthermore, our software is capable to produce pole density figures from 2 D data-sets. For quantitative texture analysis with an image plate setup, diffraction patterns of various sample orientations are measured. The, due to texture, inhomogeneous intensity distributions on the Debye-Scherrer rings are corrected for background and absorption and converted to pole density figures...|$|E

The ion fluence was 1017 particles/cm 2. The nitrogen depth profiling has been performed using the Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) method, via the study of 14 N(d,α 0) 12 C and 14 N(d,α 1) 12 C nuclear reactions, and {{with the implementation of}} SRIM 2010 and SIMNRA computer simulation codes. For the randomly oriented silicon crystal, change of the density of silicon matrix and the nitrogen ""bubble"" formation have been proposed as the explanation for the difference between the experimental and simulated nitrogen depth profiles. During the implantation, the RBS/C spectra were measured on the nitrogen implanted and on the virgin <b>crystal</b> <b>spots.</b> These spectra provide information on the amorphization of the silicon crystals induced by the ion implantation. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Miniaturized liquid {{chromatography}} nanoseparation {{in combination with}} minigel fractionation of human primary cell nuclei is presented. We obtained high-sensitivity and high-throughput identification of expressed proteins by subcellular fractionation and nanocapillary {{liquid chromatography}} interfaced to both electrospray ionization (ESI) - and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI) tandem mass spectrometry. The reversed-phase nanocapillary eluents were applied directly onto the MALDI target plate as discrete <b>crystal</b> <b>spots</b> using in-line matrix infusion. When working with primary cells, only {{a limited amount of}} sample is available. To maximize the number of identified proteins from a restricted amount of sample, miniaturized sample preparation protocols and nanoflow separation is a necessity, especially when working with low-abundant proteins. From the same isolated nuclear sample, complementary separation of intact proteins by two-dimensional (2 -D) gel electrophoresis was made. In total 594 gene products from the nuclear preparations were identified out of which 261 were unique. Several proteins involved in transcriptional events were identified such as TATA-binding protein, EBNA-co-activator, and interleukin enhancer binding proteins, indicating that sufficient proteomic depth is obtained to study transcriptional controlling events. Our results suggest that by sample prefractionation and downscaled nanoflow separation along with a combined mass spectrometry strategy, it is possible to identify a large number of nuclear proteins from human primary cells. These findings are of particular importance due to the disease link of these targets cells...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{entitled}} “In situ crystallography {{and charge}} density analysis of phase transitions in complex inorganic sulfates” consists of six chapters. Structural changes exhibited by ferroic and conducting materials are studied {{as a function}} of temperature via in situ crystallography on the same single crystal. These unique experiments bring out the changes in the crystal system resulting in subtle changes in the complex polyhedra, distortions in bond lengths and bond angles, rotation of sulfate tetrahedral around metal atoms, phase separations and charge density features. The results provide new insights into the structural changes during the phase transition in terms of coordination changes, variable bond paths and variability in electrostatic potentials while suggesting possible reaction pathways hitherto unexplored. Chapter 1 gives a brief review of the basic features of structural phase transitions in terms of types of phase transitions, their mechanisms and related properties and outlines some of the key characterization techniques employed in structural phase transition studies like single crystal diffraction, thermal analysis, conductivity, dielectric relaxation, Raman spectroscopy and charge density studies. Chapter 2 deals with the group of compounds A 3 H(SO 4) 2, where A= Rb, NH 4, K, Na which undergoes ferroelastic to paraelastic phase transitions with increase in temperature. Crystal structures of these compounds have been determined to a high degree of accuracy employing the same single crystal at room temperature at 100 K and at higher temperatures. The data collection at 100 K allows the examination of the ordered and disordered hydrogen atom positions. Rb 3 H(SO 4) 2 show two intermediate phases before reaching the paraelastic phase with increase in temperature. However, in case of (NH 4) 3 H(SO 4) 2 and K 3 H(SO 4) 2, the paraelastic phase transition involves a single step. Chapter 3 deals with variable temperature in situ single crystal X-ray diffraction studies on fast super protonic conductors AHSO 4, where A= Rb, NH 4, K to characterize the structural phase transitions as well as the dehydration mechanism. The structure of KHSO 4 at room temperature belongs to an orthorhombic crystal system with the space group symmetry Pbca and on heating to 463 K it transforms to a C centered orthorhombic lattice, space group Cmca. The high temperature structure contain two crystallographically independent units of KHSO 4 of which one KHSO 4 unit is disordered at oxygen and hydrogen sites an shows a remarkable increase of sulfur oxygen bond distance – 1. 753 (4) Å. On heating to 475 K, two units of disordered KHSO 4 combine and loose one molecule of water to result in a structure K 2 S 2 O 7 along with an ordered KHSO 4 in a monoclinic system [space group P 21 /c]. On further heating to 485 K two units of ordered KHSO 4 combine, again to lose one water molecule to give K 2 S 2 O 7 in a monoclinic crystal system [space group C 2 /c]. In the case of RbHSO 4, both the high temperature structural phase transition and a serendipitous polymorph have been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The room temperature structure is monoclinic, P 21 /n, and on heating the crystal insitu On the diffractometer to 460 K the structure changes to an orthorhombic system [space group Pmmn]. On keeping the crystallization temperature at 80 °C polymorph crystals of RbHSO 4 were grown. In case of NH 4 HSO 4 both the room temperature and high temperature structures are structurally similar to those in RbHSO 4, but the transition temperature is found to be 413 K. Chapter 4 deals with the crystal structure, ionic conduction, dielectric relaxation, Raman spectroscopy phase transition pf a fast ion conductor Na 2 Cd(SO 4) 2. The structure is monoclinic, space group C 2 /c, and is built up with inter connecting CdO 6 octahedra and SO 4 tetrahedra resulting in a framework structure. The mobile Na atoms are present in the framework, resulting in a high ionic conductivity. The conductivity measurement shows two phase transitions one at around 280 °C, which was confirmed later from DTA, dielectric relaxation, high temperature powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Chapter 5 describes the structure and in situ phase separation in two different bimetallic sulfates Na 2 Mn 1. 167 (SO 4) 2 S 0. 33 O 1. 1672 H 2 O and K 4 Cd 3 (SO 4) 5. 3 H 2 O. These compounds were synthesized keeping them as mimics of mineral structures. The structure of Na 2 Mn 1. 167 (SO 4) 2 S 0. 33 O 1. 1672 H 2 O is trigonal, space group R. The stiochiometry {{can be viewed as a}} combination of Na 2 Mn(SO 4) 22 H 2 O resembling the mineral Krohnkite with an additional (Mn 0. 167 S 0. 333 O 1. 167) motif. On heating the parent compound on the diffractometer to 500 K and keeping the capillary at this temperature for one hour, a remarkable structural phase separation occurs with one phase showing a single crystal-single crystal transition and the other generating a polycrystalline phase. The resulting single <b>crystal</b> <b>spots</b> can be indexed in a monoclinic C 2 /c space group and the structure determination unequivocally suggests the formation of Na 2 Mn(SO 4) 2, isostructural to Na 2 Cd(SO 4) z. The mechanism follows the symmetry directed pathway from the rhombohedral → monoclinic symmetry with the removal of symmetry subsequent to the loss of the two coordinated water molecules. In case of K 4 Cd 3 (SO 4) 5. 3 H 2 O the structure belongs to the space group P 21 /n at room temperature and on heating to 500 K and holding the capillary at this temperature for 60 minutes as before, the CCD images can be indexed in a cubic P 213 space group after the phase separation, generating K 2 Cd 2 (SO 4) 3, belonging to the well known Langbeinite family, while the other phase is expected to be the sought after K 2 Cd(SO 4) 2. The possible pathways have been discussed. Chapter 6 reports the charge density studies of phase transitions in a type II langbeinite, Rb 2 Mn 2 (SO 4) 3. The structure displays two different phases, cubic at 200 K, orthorhombic at 100 K respectively. After multiple refinements it is found that there are significant differences in the actual bond path (Rij) and the conventional bond length. In the cubic phase the distortions in sulfate tetrahedral are more than in the orthorhombic phase which could be the expected driving force for the phase transition to occur.

40|$|Objectives We {{report the}} mineral (hydroxyapatite) density {{of sound and}} opaque areas in DMH molars with sound parts of (carious) {{deciduous}} teeth serving as controls. Methods Twenty-nine extracted second primary molars obtained from 15 children were studied. Thirteen of these molars were DMH molars with yellow opacities, seven were DMH molars with white opacities, three DMH molars with brown opacities and eleven were molars without DMH. Prior to microCT scanning, the teeth were mounted in impression material (Impregum®) and stored in water with a thymol <b>crystal.</b> <b>Spot</b> analysis and line scans were performed in areas with opacities and in sound areas. An ANOVA test and t-tests were used to test if {{there were significant differences}} between the groups. Results The average densities of the hydroxyapatite in yellow and brown opacities (1368 mg HA/cm 2 and 1407 mg HA/cm 2, respectively) were significantly lower than in clinically unaffected enamel (1747 mg HA/cm 2) of DMH molars or of sound molars (1758 mg HA/cm 2). The mineral density in white opacities (1737 mg HA/cm 2) was not different from that in the enamel of sound molars. The mineral density values in yellow and brown enamel opacities were in between those of dentine (1018 mg HA/cm 2) and enamel. Conclusions DMH molars with yellow or brown opacities had a 20 - 22 % lower mineral density in the hypomineralised enamel compared with sound molars. White opacities do not show a lower mineral content. The reduction in enamel mineral content in DMH molars stressed the need for a preventive approach in DMH...|$|R

Two types of the CrN-coated specimens (CrN/Si and CrN/Cr/Si) by cathodic arc plasma deposition were prepared {{with and without}} a MEVVA Cr-implanted interlayer.

40|$|Different {{processes}} to form particles of explosives and propellants with supercrit. fluids {{such as the}} RESS-, the PCA-, and the GAS process are explained, and first results are presented. Esp. with regard to insensitive explosives, the formation of <b>crystals</b> without <b>spots,</b> i. e. free of solvent inclusions, is aspired. For the RESS process (rapid expansion of supercrit. solns.), the formation of particles results from {{the rapid expansion of}} a loaded supercrit. fluid. The GAS process (gas anti-solvent) uses a high-compressed fluid as anti-solvent to lower the solvent power of a common solvent and thus to recrystallize the solid. In the PCA process (pptn. with a compressed fluid anti-solvent) the soln. and the compressed gas are simultaneously injected into the crystallizer in counter-current flow. The processes have significant advantages for the particle formation of sensitive energetic materials due to the moderate operation conditions (temp. and pressure) if CO 2 is used as solvent or as anti-solvent.

U–Pb zircon SHRIMP geochronology of six detrital sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks (114 zircon <b>crystals,</b> 118 <b>spot</b> analyses) has improved the understanding of the sedimentary processes and provenance ages of both rocks and the associated iron formation. The age of deposition of the iron formation is constrained between 2. 58 and 2. 42 Ga. The presence of an old Paleoarchean crust is dated in detrital zircon crystals, including the oldest zircon in South America (3809 G 3 Ma). Only high-Th/U, magmatic zircon crystals are present in the dated sedimentary rocks, and these indicate that the crust of the region was formed mostly during the Jequie´ cycle (six age peaks between 3055 and 2635 Ma). This time span ofw 420 m. y. is similar to the duration of a long-lived Wilson cycle. Most of the Rio das Velhas Basin was filled during approximately 30 m. y. between 2746 and 2717 Ma, though volcanism probably started earlier. The youngest detrital zircon age from the Minas Supergroup indicates that the intracratonic basin fill, including the iron formation, was deposited after 2580 Ma. Therefore, the crust was cratonized shortly after the intrusion of minor granitic bodies at around 2. 62 – 2. 58 Ga.

In particular, sensing and biodiagnostics {{take advantage of}} the affinity exhibited by gold nanoparticles towards thiols to form Au-(bio) -conjugates through a simple surface chemistry. Moreover, the chance to excite gold surface plasmons upon interaction with an electromagnetic field gave rise to ultra-sensitive diagnostic techniques such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies (SEVSs). We report the in situ generation of Au/TiO 2 micrometric spots on polymeric colloidal <b>crystals.</b> These <b>spots</b> resulted from the local crystallization of amorphous TiO 2 (a-TiO 2), which was induced by interaction between a low-power CW laser and closely aggregated gold nanoparticles, and promoted by the polymeric support. The enhancement of the electromagnetic field due to the presence of gold nanoparticles allowed the in situ SERS characterization of the anatase thin film. Finally, we showed that these spots can be used as model sites to investigate some reaction occurring at the metal oxide surface. This is an important benefit in some research fields, such as photocatalysis in nanoscaled devices, as it allows some parameters, like the thickness of the photocatalyst or the concentration of the catalytic substrate to be optimized. Moreover, these substrates could be conveniently employed as plasmonic photocatalysts, enabling a number of important reactions to occur with high efficiency and minimal light exposure. In perspective, this approach could easily be extended to other classes of compounds, opening new frontiers for plasmon heating-driven processes...|$|R
40|$|Factors {{that affect}} the {{visibility}} of lattice fringes include crystal orientation and thickness, as well as instrument response. As a crystal gets smaller, lattice fringes stay visible for larger deviations from the Bragg condition. Hence the persistence of fringes under tilt affects the abundance and range of lattice spacings (and angles) that one sees in an image of randomly-oriented crystals. A subset of the fringes in an image are “still-visible ” after large (e. g. 35 °) single or double axis tilts. 1 If one is looking for “new-fringes ” from the same crystal (e. g. to analyze it’s 3 D lattice parameters 2), rules for recognizing redundant fringes might also help out. Here we examine a semi-empirical model for predicting the visibility of lattice fringes after tilt, by connecting the visibility to intersection of the corresponding <b>crystal</b> reciprocal-lattice <b>spot</b> with the illuminating Ewald sphere. In particular, {{we assume that the}} fringe disappears if the angle between beam direction and lattice plane normal deviates from 90 ° by more than the half-angle α ≈ θB + tan- 1 [fd/t], where θB is the Bragg angle, d is lattice spacing, t is crystal thickness {{in the direction of the}} beam, and f is a specimen-dependent signal/noise factor of order 1. Based on the fraction of randomly-oriented crystals showing fringes, for example, f for one Au/Pd specimen was shown 3 to be ≅ 0. 95. These assumptions allow one to predict, among other things, the range of azimuthal deviations of the tilt axis from the lattice plane normal (ϕ) for which fringes will remain visible, for any given goniometer tilt from th...|$|R

Simple parallelism is achieved by allocating each image to a different core. This level of parallelization is sufficient to keep up with current data rates with current analysis techniques, hence there is no present need for intra-image parallelism.|$|R
