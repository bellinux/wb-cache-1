5|$|The {{upper body}} had a <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> with three bench seats, {{one for the}} driver and his assistant, and two others for the crew. The rear cargo area {{contained}} storage compartments, {{one on each side}} and two in the rear. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted above the rear storage compartments. It fastened to the windshield when erected.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a baggage {{compartment}} separating the driver's compartment from the <b>crew</b> <b>compartment.</b> Bench {{seats on the}} sides of the vehicle, with under-seat storage, could accommodate six men. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected. Four side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> {{common to all}} versions. This had bench seats, one for the driver and his assistant, and another for the crew. The rear portion of the upper body was adapted for the vehicle's {{intended}} role. The artillery model had two extra bench seats for the gun's crew and space for its ammunition. The cargo version had just two storage compartments mounted {{in the front of}} the cargo compartment, one on each side, that opened to the outside. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected.|$|E
50|$|The {{body and}} chassis are {{completely}} welded construction with <b>crew</b> <b>compartments</b> on both ends. It contains two machine compartments and one high voltage <b>compartment.</b> Moving between <b>crew</b> cabins is enabled by 570 mm wide corridor {{running along the}} box wall. machine compartments are reached through the doors in the back walls of <b>crew</b> <b>compartments.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>crew</b> rest <b>compartment</b> (<b>crew</b> rest) is {{section of}} an {{airliner}} dedicated for breaks and sleeping by the staff.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary combat {{vehicles}} may {{incorporate a}} fire-suppression system to mitigate damage from fire. Systems {{can be employed}} in the engine and <b>crew</b> <b>compartments</b> and portable systems may be mounted {{inside and outside the}} vehicle as well.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{experiments}} were to be performed inside the orbiter <b>crew</b> <b>compartment.</b> Among these was the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System, being flown for the fourth time. This separated solutions of biological materials by passing electric fields through them; the experiment aimed at supporting research into diabetes treatments. A small animal cage was flown containing six rats; no animal experiment was carried out on the flight, but a student involvement project was planned for a later mission which would use the cage, and NASA wanted to ensure it was flight-tested. The student involvement project carried out on STS-8 involved William Thornton using biofeedback techniques, to try {{to determine if they}} worked in microgravity. A photography experiment would attempt to study the spectrum of a luminous atmospheric glow which had been reported around the orbiter, and determine how this interacted with firings of the reaction control system.|$|E
5|$|A five-man crew, {{the first}} pilot, co-pilot, {{navigator}} radar, navigator plotter and air electronics officer (AEO) was accommodated within the pressure cabin on two levels; the pilots sitting on Martin-Baker 3K (3KS on the B.2) ejection seats whilst {{on the lower}} level, the other crew sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the entrance door. The original B35/46 specification sought a jettisonable <b>crew</b> <b>compartment,</b> this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected. A rudimentary sixth seat forward of the navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and forward of the AEO. These seats {{were no more than}} cushions, a full harness and an oxygen and intercom facility. The visual bomb-aimer's compartment could be fitted with a T4 (Blue Devil) bombsight, in many B.2s this space housed a vertically mounted Vinten F95 Mk.10 camera for assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.|$|E
5|$|The HL234, {{an engine}} born from the {{developments}} initiated {{by attempting to}} convert the Maybach HL230 to fuel injection, would have increased the power to about 800 to 900 PS (hp). The Entwicklungskommission Panzer unanimously decided that HL234 be immediately included in the engine design and procurement program. The AK-7-200 was also explored {{as an alternative to}} the Maybach Olvar-B drive train, but Waffenamt research and development department Wa Prüf 6 found that it offered inferior driving characteristics and so the Maybach Olvar-B was retained. There are also a program using the Simmering- Graz-Pauker Sla.16 engine, but the war's constraint on supplies and capitulation resulted in the cancellation of this program. Krupp proposed mounting a new main weapon, the 10.5cm KwK L/68. Wa Prüf 6 was not supportive of this as the Heer had not accepted the cannon itself. Other suggested improvements included stabilised sights, a stabilised main gun, an automatic ammunition feed, a Zeiss stereoscopic range finder, heated <b>crew</b> <b>compartment,</b> stowage for an additional 12 rounds, and an overpressure & air filtration system to protect against poison gas. However, these also never got beyond the proposal stage or did not enter production before the war ended.|$|E
50|$|Crew rests may {{be located}} above or {{adjacent}} to the passenger <b>compartment.</b> <b>Crew</b> rest <b>compartments</b> are normally segregated, with separate compartments for the flight crew and the cabin crew.|$|R
50|$|The cab and gun <b>crew</b> <b>compartments</b> of the Type 73 {{are fully}} {{enclosed}} steel designs, with ammunition {{carried in a}} separate compartment at the rear. A 400 hp Mitsubishi diesel engine powers full tracks, and armament is a single 12.7mm anti-aircraft machine gun.|$|R
50|$|Previous {{efforts to}} mount bigger guns on smaller chassis {{resulted}} in the Marder series as well as StuG IIIs. The Marder series were tall and had open <b>crew</b> <b>compartments.</b> The new design had a low silhouette and completely enclosed, casemate fighting compartment.|$|R
25|$|Electronic weather {{reconnaissance}} variant {{with the}} <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> modified for two observers, 36 built with two later modified to X-21A.|$|E
25|$|All {{recovered}} non-human Columbia debris {{is stored}} in unused office space at the Vehicle Assembly Building, except for parts of the <b>crew</b> <b>compartment,</b> which are kept separate.|$|E
25|$|Because of heat {{generated}} at Mach 2 cruise, {{not only the}} <b>crew</b> <b>compartment,</b> but the wheel wells and electronics bay were pressurized and air conditioned. The B-58 utilized {{one of the first}} extensive applications of aluminum honeycomb panels, which bonded outer and inner aluminum skins to a honeycomb of aluminum or fiberglass.|$|E
25|$|The capacious {{fuselage}} {{housed the}} <b>crew</b> <b>compartments</b> {{as well as}} the four engines and their clutches and combining gearboxes. This configuration offered the advantage that the engines could be accessed in-flight for adjustment or minor repairs. However, there were serious problems during development with engine cooling and vibration.|$|R
5000|$|The {{high noise}} level {{was due to}} design and space {{restrictions}} in the engine cowlings {{which resulted in the}} exhaust [...] "stacks" [...] protruding directly from the cowling ring and partly covered by a small triangular fairing. This arrangement directed exhaust and noise directly at the pilot and <b>crew</b> <b>compartments.</b>|$|R
25|$|The B-10 {{began as}} the Martin Model 123, a private venture by the Glenn L. Martin Company of Baltimore, Maryland. It had {{a crew of}} four: pilot, copilot, nose gunner and {{fuselage}} gunner. As in previous bombers, the four <b>crew</b> <b>compartments</b> were open, {{but it had a}} number of design innovations as well.|$|R
25|$|The Mistel project, a {{composite}} aircraft configuration, was advocated by Peltz at the time. The configuration was a fighter aircraft mounted {{on top of}} a pilot-less bomber aircraft with its <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> replaced with a high-explosive warhead. The plan was to use these weapon systems against hardened targets such as bridges and enemy shipping.|$|E
25|$|The ULTRA AP (Armored Patrol) is {{a concept}} combat vehicle that was {{unveiled}} in September 2005 by the Georgia Tech Research Institute, the applied research arm of the Georgia Institute of Technology, under contract from the Office of Naval Research. This was followed in 2009 with the ULTRA II, which was more focused on further developing the <b>crew</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|E
25|$|The B-36 had {{a crew of}} 15. As in the B-29 and B-50, the {{pressurized}} {{flight deck}} and <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> were linked to the rear compartment by a pressurized tunnel through the bomb bay. In the B-36, movement through the tunnel was on a wheeled trolley, pulling on a rope. The rear compartment featured six bunks and a dining galley, {{and led to the}} tail turret.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 1970s the vans {{underwent}} various changes. Early in {{the decade}} they gained vents in the guards compartment at floor level, and later {{in the decade}} some vans were modified to include <b>crew</b> <b>compartments</b> for travelling between depots. These wagons are recognisable by the extra, small sliding door at the crew end.|$|R
50|$|As the EP08 is tightly {{based on}} EU06 and EU07 {{locomotives}} {{it is important}} to compare those series while writing about technical features. EP08 is a Bo-Bo locomotive with four axles mounted on two bogies. Each axle is propelled separately by an EE541a traction motor. The cab has two identical <b>crew</b> <b>compartments</b> on both ends.|$|R
5000|$|Crocodile (German Krokodil) {{electric}} locomotives are so called {{because they have}} long [...] "noses" [...] at each end, reminiscent of the snout of a crocodile (see also Steeplecab). These contain the motors and drive axles, and are connected by an articulated center section. The center section usually contains the <b>crew</b> <b>compartments,</b> pantographs and transformer.|$|R
25|$|A {{transfer}} caboose {{looks more}} like a flat car with a shed bolted to the middle of it than it does a standard caboose. It is used in transfer service between rail yards or short switching runs, and as such, lacks sleeping, cooking or restroom facilities. The ends of a transfer caboose are left open, with safety railings surrounding the area between the <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> {{and the end of the}} car.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} extra engines {{and the very}} {{different}} <b>crew</b> <b>compartment,</b> together with the removal of passenger accommodation, the AB-20 and DB-70 had much in common: the thick centre section and high-mounted outer wings, twin fuselages carrying a long horizontal stabilizer, and twin fins and rudders. Both aircraft had conventional undercarriages with pairs of mainwheels widely separated on V-struts attached to the lower longerons of the centre section.|$|E
25|$|Multihulls {{rely on the}} {{geometry}} and the broad stance of the multiple hulls for their stability, eschewing any form of ballast. Indeed, multihulls {{are designed to be}} as light-weight as possible, yet maintain structural integrity. They are often built with foam-filled flotation chambers and many modern commercial trimarans are rated as unsinkable, meaning that, should every <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> be completely filled with water, the hull itself has sufficient buoyancy to remain afloat.|$|E
2500|$|Given {{the massive}} {{size of the}} plane, its overall {{performance}} was never considered sprightly or agile; Lieutenant General James Edmundson likened it to [...] "...sitting on your front porch and flying your house around." [...] Despite its immense exterior size, the pressurized <b>crew</b> <b>compartments</b> were relatively cramped, especially when occupied for 24 hours by a crew of 15 in full flight kit.|$|R
50|$|In May 1987, the ten newest driving {{trailers}} based as Hornsby were renumbered D4001-D4010 and {{the remainder}} began to have their control equipment removed and revert to ordinary trailers. To allow the Tangaras to be targeted as T sets, the remaining two car sets became L sets in April 1988. When refurbished in the 1990s the <b>crew</b> <b>compartments</b> were removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{habitable}} module was {{the main}} living quarters for the crew. The cylindrical 3.6 x 20 m module consisted of six individual <b>crew</b> <b>compartments,</b> a kitchen/dining room, a living room, the main control room, and a toilet. The individual bedroom compartments, which had an area of approximately 3 m2 each, contained a bed, a desk, a chair and shelves for personal belongings.|$|R
25|$|The initial Canberra PR3 {{model was}} shortly succeeded by the {{improved}} PR7 variant. The PR7 featured greater fuel capacity via wing storage, {{the more powerful}} RA.7 model of the Avon engine, and Maxaret anti-lock braking system. The Canberra PR9 was the final photo reconnaissance version; this aircraft was furnished with a new <b>crew</b> <b>compartment,</b> a redesigned inner wing section, and much more powerful RA.24 Avon engine. In later service, bomber models of the Canberra were often converted with cameras and other equipment suited for reconnaissance purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle was {{designed}} for the Constellation program as a <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> for use in low Earth orbit. Lockheed Martin {{was selected as the}} prime contractor for the Orion project on August 31, 2006, and Boeing was selected to build its primary heat shield on September 15, 2006. NASA initially planned to develop different Orion capsules tailored for specific missions. The Block I Orion was to be used for International Space Station missions and other Earth orbit missions, while the Block II and III variants were designed for deep-space exploration.|$|E
25|$|The Ju 88C was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} fighter-bomber and heavy fighter by adding fixed, forward-firing guns to the nose while retaining some bomb carrying ability of the A-series bomber. The C-series had a solid metal nose, typically housing one 20mm MG FF cannon and three 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns. The aircraft retained the ventral Bola gondola under the <b>crew</b> <b>compartment</b> though individual units sometimes removed this to reduce weight and drag to enhance performance. The Ju-88C was later used as a night fighter, and this became its main role.|$|E
5000|$|Given {{the massive}} {{size of the}} plane, its overall {{performance}} was never considered sprightly or agile; Lieutenant General James Edmundson likened it to [...] "...sitting on your front porch and flying your house around." [...] Despite its immense exterior size, the pressurized <b>crew</b> <b>compartments</b> were relatively cramped, especially when occupied for 24 hours by a crew of 15 in full flight kit.|$|R
25|$|There were {{a number}} of foreign {{customers}} for the SB. They were mostly satisfied with the aircraft's performance. There were some complaints about the high noise level, cramped <b>crew</b> <b>compartments,</b> hard undercarriage suspension and in particular about the front gunner's position, which could be reached only through a hatch under the fuselage, preventing the gunner from escaping {{in the event of a}} ditching or belly landing. Czechoslovakia signed an agreement to produce ANT-40 as Avia B-71.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2008, {{scientists}} {{reported they}} had found that the crew of Hunley had not set her pump to remove water from the <b>crews</b> <b>compartment,</b> and this might indicate she was not being flooded. [...] "It now really starts to point {{to a lack of}} oxygen making crew unconscious," [...] the chairman of the South Carolina Hunley Commission said. [...] "They may have been cranking and moving and it was a miscalculation as to how much oxygen they had." ...|$|R
