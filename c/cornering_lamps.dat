25|$|American {{technical}} standards contain provisions for front <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps</b> {{as well as}} for rear <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps.</b> <b>Cornering</b> <b>lamps</b> have traditionally been prohibited under international UN Regulations, though provisions have recently been made to allow them {{as long as they are}} only operable when the vehicle is travelling at less than 40 kilometres per hour (about 25mph).|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{available}} 1969 options were a tilt-telescope steering wheel, instant horn, four season air conditioning with comfortron, tinted glass windshield, 6-way power seat, divided front seat with dual controls, power trunk release (vacuum), power door locks, power front disc brakes, AM-FM stereo radio, rear seat speaker, stereo tape player (8-track), power operated antenna, door edge guards, cruise control, left outside remote control mirror, <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps,</b> anti-spin rear axle, vinyl roof, flo-thru ventilation, and safety sentinel.|$|E
25|$|On some models, <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps</b> provide white steady-intensity {{light for}} lateral {{illumination}} {{in the direction}} of an intended turn or lane change. They are generally actuated in conjunction with the turn signals, and they may be wired to also illuminate when the vehicle is shifted into reverse gear,. Some modern vehicles activate the cornering lamp on one or the other side when the steering wheel input reaches a predetermined angle in that direction, regardless of whether a turn signal has been activated.|$|E

They straggled across the window, which she faced like a companion across table; one family, she thought, poor and dignified -for Mrs. Sibling, although retired, never would cease to be a social worker-all different sizes, of whom first one and then another took the lead in a pseudopodic motion from the mass, only to draw in uncertainly. They progressed as slowly as the littlest boy who dragged his feet and was growing chilly in his sun suit. Reaching the <b>corner</b> <b>lamp,</b> they stood swaying under it, looking up at the street sign. Then they turned back...|$|R
5000|$|The Modus {{was offered}} with a <b>cornering</b> <b>lamp</b> function. Concealed {{in the main}} {{headlamp}} unit and operating at speeds less than 38 mi/h km/h, the lights gave the driver a wider field of vision when going round bends. On Privilège and Initiale models, Renault offered the Modus with [...] "double-distance" [...] Xenon headlamps.|$|R
25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps</b> had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, electronic message center, electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|E
500|$|The {{facelift}} of the Citroën C3 Picasso appeared {{first at}} the 2012 Paris Motor Show on 27 September. The new eMyWay SatNav system, located on the central console, is more functional than the previous model, allowing connection to a reversing camera (available as an extra), which displays on the console screen. LED daytime running lamps and fog lamps with built-in <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps,</b> which illuminate the roadside, are also non-standard features on the facelifted C3 Picasso. In addition, Citroën has added two new exterior paint colour options; [...] "Pearlescent white" [...] and [...] "Ink blue" [...] to the vehicle. The front grille now features Citroën's new branding, joining the two chrome chevron badge {{in the form of}} a crown.|$|E
2500|$|Forward {{illumination}} {{is provided}} by high- ("main", [...] "full", [...] "driving") and low- ("dip", [...] "dipped", [...] "passing") beam headlamps, which may be augmented by auxiliary fog lamps, driving lamps, or <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|E
60|$|They {{turned away}} {{down into a}} little lane where an old, white, timbered cottage presided ghostly at the corner. Some church magnate had his garden back there; and it was quiet, along the waving line of a high wall, behind which grew sycamores {{spreading}} close-bunched branches, whose shadows, {{in the light of}} the <b>corner</b> <b>lamps,</b> lay thick along the ground this glamourous August night. A chafer buzzed by, a small black cat played with its tail on some steps in a recess. Nobody passed.|$|R

50|$|The 1968 Imperial {{was little}} {{changed from the}} {{previous}} year. The grille changed to a brightly chromed one with thin horizontal bars, split in the middle by vertical chrome and a round Imperial Eagle badge. The <b>cornering</b> <b>lamp</b> lenses were now covered by matching grilles. At the rear, the horizontal bars over the taillights remained, but the gas filler door pull was changed to a cast metal eagle instead of a round knob containing a plastic emblem. All 1968s came with a Federally mandated energy absorbing steering column. The base level model was cancelled after only one year and the four-door sedan {{became part of the}} Crown level of trim. This was also the last year for the Imperial convertible. A total of 15,367 Imperials were sold in 1968.|$|R
2500|$|At its launch, the Taurus was {{available}} in four models; the L, the MT-5, the GL, and the LX. The L was the base model, with only {{the most basic of}} equipment. The MT-5 was the second model, which was aimed at Japanese imports, as it was only available with a 4-cylinder engine and a five-speed manual transmission (hence the term MT-5). The value model was the GL, which contained more equipment than the MT-5 and L, and had such interior upgrades like rear headrests and a folding rear armrest, electric windows and locks. The LX was the top of the line model, which had the most standard equipment, as well as many features that were unique to this model, such as <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps</b> and side body cladding, as well as its own unique seat design, automatic climate control, light packages, luggage convenience kit, electronic cluster with onboard system scanner and fuel computer, autolamps with timer, premium amplified stereo with 6 speakers [...] "Premium Sound", 6 way electric seats with inflatable lumbar support and other equipment options at an added price. The wagon was offered in the same trim levels in the same order.|$|E

50|$|Water Police Offices and Wharves The Water Police office {{building}} is a two-storeyed reinforced concrete structure with a hipped tiled roof and deep eaves. The building faces the Brisbane River to the south, with a rear street entrance from the north. The building has large sash windows with expressed sills and window surrounds, and long tiled sunhoods to the ground floor windows along the east, north and west elevations. The southern elevation has a cantilevered verandah to the first floor, with tiled awning, timber posts, batten balustrade and handrail, and <b>corner</b> <b>lamps</b> supported by curved metal brackets. French doors with fanlights open from the ground floor to the south, and onto the verandah from the first floor.

50|$|A mild face lift {{characterized}} Cadillac styling {{trends for}} 1962. A flatter grille with a thicker horizontal center bar and more delicate cross-hatched insert appeared. Ribbed chrome trim panel, seen {{ahead of the}} front wheel housings in 1961, were now replaced with <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps</b> and front fender model and series identification badges were eliminated. More massive front bumper end pieces appeared and housed rectangular parking lamps. At the rear tail lamps were now housed in vertical nacelles designed with an angled peak at the center. A vertically ribbed rear beauty panel appeared on the deck lid latch panel. Cadillac script also appeared on the lower {{left side of the}} radiator grille. New standard equipment included remote control outside rearview mirror, heater and defroster and front <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The range has a {{high level}} {{standard}} specification compared to similar vehicles from other manufacturers, including a lane departure warning system, cruise control, speed limiter, trip computer (instant MPG, average MPG, average speed, stop watch and trip computer), tyre pressure monitoring system, electronic stability program and traction control, front fog lamps and <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The 1967 Caprice {{received}} a restyling with more rounded body lines and revised grilles and taillights, optional front fender <b>corner</b> <b>lamps</b> which illuminated with the headlamps, {{as well as}} a revised instrument panel with round instruments and a new steering wheel. Taillight lenses were all red as the backup lights were relocated into the rear bumper, unlike in the lesser full-size models that had their backup lamps {{in the center of the}} taillights. A dual-master brake cylinder was now included, while front disc brakes were optional. Other new options included a stereo 8-track tape player, power door locks, and a fiber optic exterior light monitoring system. The same seating selections continued as before with revisions to trim patterns plus the new addition of all-vinyl upholstery as a no-cost option for conventional and Strato bench seats in sedans and coupes. Engines and transmission offerings were carried over from the previous year. The exception was the optional [...] Turbo Jet V8 was no longer listed, leaving the [...] 427 as the top engine. The three-speed Turbo Hydramatic transmission that previously only available with the [...] and [...] V8s was now optional with the [...] Turbo Fire V8.

5000|$|The bodystyle was a 4-door hardtop, but it wasn't a true hardtop, using a [...] "B" [...] pillar {{between the}} front and rear {{passenger}} compartments, and instead it used frameless doors. The Inspire was available in two versions; a shorter and narrower version badged as the Accord Inspire, with a G20A 2.0L engine in compliance with Japanese vehicle size requirements for cars classified as [...] "compact". The CB5 Inspire was offered in 3 trim levels, the base AZ-I with manual transmission, AG-I with fog lamps and optional sunroof as well as central locking, and the top spec luxury AX-I with leather upholstery, more safety features and full cruise control as well as power seats. A longer and wider version with the 5 cylinder G25A 2.5L engine debuted in early 1992, similar in dimensions to the first generation Legend. The larger CC2-CC3 Inspire was a mild refresh of the first CB5 Inspire, featuring updated full-width boot lamps (the updated Vigor had conventional single lamp units) with less chrome, larger bumpers with new wrap-around <b>cornering</b> <b>lamp</b> design (instead of the optional separate units like the CB5) and mesh alloy wheels. Following the 1992 refresh, the Inspire offered fewer trim levels and the inline-5 received upgrades (power was up from 118KW to 140KW). The CC2 Inspire shared more features with the Acura Vigor under a 'wide-body' marketing campaign with minor differences.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{the name}} {{bestowed}} in my time {{on one of the}} sides of the Square by the senior students of that town of classical learning and historical relics. The common citizens knew nothing of it, and, even if they had, would not have dreamed of taking it seriously. He who used it was of the initiated, belonged to the Schools. We youngsters regarded that name as a fine jest, the invention of a most excellent fancy. Even as I uttered it to my boy I experienced again that sense of my privileged initiation. And then, happening to look up at the wall, I saw {{in the light of the}} <b>corner</b> <b>lamp,</b> a white, cast-iron tablet fixed thereon, bearing an inscription in raised black letters, thus: [...] "Line A.B." [...] Heavens! The name had been adopted officially! Any town urchin, any guttersnipe, any herb-selling woman of the market-place, any wandering Boeotian, was free to talk of the line A.B., to walk on the line A.B., to appoint to meet his friends on the line A.B. It had become a mere name in a directory. I was stunned by the extreme mutability of things. Time could work wonders, and no mistake. A Municipality had stolen an invention of excellent fancy, and a fine jest had turned into a horrid piece of cast- iron.|$|R

50|$|As {{with the}} 1988-1991 models, the Grand Marquis was {{available}} in base-trim GS and deluxe-trim LS models; LS models are distinguished by front <b>cornering</b> <b>lamps.</b> From 1992 onward, the Grand Marquis was produced solely as a four-door sedan, as the Colony Park station wagon was discontinued.

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1971, a visitor to the De Tomaso plant at Modena {{identified}} {{two different types of}} Pantera awaiting shipment, being respectively the European and American versions. From outside, the principal differences were the larger tail lamps on the cars destined for America, along with addition of <b>corner</b> marker <b>lamps.</b> The visitor was impressed by the large number of cars awaiting shipment; in reality, spending the best part of a year under dust covers in a series of large hangars probably did nothing for the cash-flow of the business or the condition of some of the cars by the time they crossed the Atlantic.

6000|$|Dark, funereal barges {{like my own}} had flitted by, and the gondoliers {{had warned}} each other at every turning with hoarse, lugubrious cries; the lines of balconied palaces had never ended;--here and there at their doors larger craft were moored, with dim figures of men moving uncertainly about on them. At last we had passed {{abruptly}} out of the Grand Canal {{into one of the}} smaller channels, and from comparative light into a darkness only remotely affected by some far-streaming <b>corner</b> <b>lamp.</b> But always the pallid, stately palaces; always the dark heaven with its trembling stars above, and the dark water with its trembling stars below; but now innumerable bridges, and an utter lonesomeness, and ceaseless sudden turns and windings. One could not resist a vague feeling of anxiety, in these strait and solitary passages, which was part of the strange enjoyment of the time, and which was referable to the novelty, the hush, the darkness, and the piratical appearance and unaccountable pauses of the gondoliers. Was not this Venice, and is not Venice forever associated with bravoes and unexpected dagger-thrusts? That valise of mine might represent fabulous wealth to the uncultivated imagination. Who, if I made an outcry, could understand the Facts of the Situation--(as we say in the journals)? To move on was relief; to pause was regret for past transgressions mingled with good resolutions for the future. But I felt the liveliest mixture of all these emotions, when, slipping from the cover of a bridge, the gondola suddenly rested {{at the foot of a}} stairway before a closely-barred door.
