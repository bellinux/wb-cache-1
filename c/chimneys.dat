5|$|Damage was {{confined}} to Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and south-central Iowa, and largely consisted of fallen <b>chimneys,</b> foundation cracks, collapsed parapets, and overturned tombstones. In one home in Dale, Illinois, near Tuckers Corners and southwest of McLeansboro, the quake cracked interior walls, plaster, and <b>chimneys.</b> Using a type of victim study, the local post office surveyed residents and implemented a field inspection which indicated the strongest shaking (MM VII) {{took place in the}} Wabash Valley, Ohio Valley, and other nearby south-central Illinois lowlands. Outside this four-state zone, oscillating objects including cars, <b>chimneys,</b> and the Gateway Arch were reported to authorities.|$|E

50|$|A <b>chimney</b> pot {{is placed}} {{on top of the}} <b>chimney</b> to expand the length of the <b>chimney</b> inexpensively, and to improve the <b>chimney's</b> draft. A <b>chimney</b> with more than one pot on it {{indicates}} that {{there is more than one}} fireplace on different floors sharing the <b>chimney.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Chimney</b> {{bombs are}} zip-lock bags or other small bags filled with ABC dry {{chemical}} powder. <b>Chimney</b> bombs {{are used by}} fire service personnel to help extinguish <b>chimney</b> fires. Creosote, which is the by-product of the incomplete burning of wood (typically due to chronic combustion-air insufficiency), is extinguished by the chain reaction caused by the <b>chimney</b> bombs. <b>Chimney</b> bombs work by first being dropped directly down a <b>chimney,</b> where upon contact with the flue bottom and heat of the fire, they explode, thereby releasing the powder. Then, the natural <b>chimney</b> draft will carry the dry chemical powder up the shaft of the <b>chimney,</b> thus coating the creosote and eventually neutralizing the fire. Use of multiple <b>chimney</b> bombs may be necessary, depending on how severe the fire is. <b>Chimney</b> bombs can also be effective if they are opened and then dropped down the <b>chimney.</b> In order for <b>chimney</b> bombs to be effective, {{it may be necessary}} to first unclog the <b>chimney.</b>|$|R
50|$|The upper {{portion of}} the lamp uses a <b>chimney</b> like Mueseler and Morgan lamps. The rising gases pass up the <b>chimney</b> and through a gauze. At {{the top of the}} <b>chimney</b> a dished {{reflector}} diverts the gases out sideways through a number of holes in the <b>chimney.</b> The gases then start to rise up the intermediate <b>chimney</b> before exiting through another gauze. Gas finally passes down between the outermost <b>chimney</b> and the intermediate <b>chimney,</b> exiting a little above the glass. The outer <b>chimney</b> is therefore effectively a shield.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Chimney</b> Safety Institute of America (CSIA) is a United States {{non-profit}} educational institute that educates American homeowners, home inspectors, <b>chimney</b> sweeps, {{firefighters and}} related professionals about {{the prevention of}} <b>chimney</b> fires and carbon monoxide intrusion. The organization builds {{awareness of the need}} for annual <b>chimney</b> inspections and service by a qualified <b>chimney</b> professional. CSIA was created in 1983 as the educational arm of the National <b>Chimney</b> Sweep Guild. Every <b>chimney</b> sweep in the U.S. and Canada is eligible to participate.

50|$|A <b>chimney</b> breast is {{a portion}} of a <b>chimney</b> which {{projects}} forward from a wall to accommodate a fireplace. Typically {{on the ground floor of}} a structure, the masonry extends upwards, containing a flue which carries smoke out of the building through a <b>chimney</b> stack. <b>Chimney</b> jambs similarly project from the wall, but they do so on either side of the fireplace and serve to support the <b>chimney</b> breast. The interior of a <b>chimney</b> breast is commonly filled with brickwork or concrete.|$|R

5|$|The 2-acre (1 ha) walled {{kitchen garden}} {{was built in}} the early 1700s to provide fruit and {{vegetables}} for the estate. The Victorian head gardener's cottage is built into the southern wall. Alongside the west wall is a private path, known as the Colonel's Walk, used by the family to bypass the kitchen garden on their way to church. There are traces of original <b>chimneys</b> built into the wall supporting espaliered fruit trees, located there in order to maintain an optimum temperature for year-round growth. One of these <b>chimneys</b> has been restored. The garden is still in use today and includes traditional and exotic varieties , and fruit bushes, some of which are used to make jams and chutneys for sale in the hall's tearooms.|$|E
30|$|The {{responses}} of <b>chimney</b> {{in terms of}} lateral deflection, base moment, tangential moments and radial moments were investigated. The {{responses of}} <b>chimney</b> obtained from the SSI analysis of chimney–piled raft system were compared with that obtained from <b>chimney</b> with fixed base. The results obtained from finite element analysis of <b>chimney</b> with fixed base are designated as “Fixed” in graphs and tables. The percentage variation of maximum values of the moments in the <b>chimney</b> considering SSI from those obtained from the finite element analysis of <b>chimney</b> with fixed base was computed. The effect of SSI was studied by considering different parameters such as flexibility of soil, stiffness of the raft of piled raft foundation, slenderness ratio of the <b>chimney</b> and <b>chimney</b> elevation.|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to study the flow {{dynamics}} both qualitatively and quantitatively. A common measure {{for the quality of}} the full process in a <b>chimney</b> is the draft in the <b>chimney.</b> And the draft in the <b>chimney</b> depends e.g. on the heat source, on the <b>chimney</b> geometry, on the <b>chimney</b> friction and heat loss parameters, on the outside meteorological situation etc.|$|R
25|$|In its {{simplest}} form, {{the solar}} <b>chimney</b> {{consists of a}} black-painted <b>chimney.</b> During the day solar energy heats the <b>chimney</b> and the air within it, creating an updraft of air in the <b>chimney.</b> The suction created at the <b>chimney's</b> base {{can be used to}} ventilate and cool the building below. In most parts of the world it is easier to harness wind power for such ventilation as with a windcatcher, but on hot windless days a Solar <b>chimney</b> can provide ventilation where otherwise there would be none.|$|R

5|$|DisCo built {{a station}} at Lemington, {{in the western}} {{outskirts}} of the city, to provide electricity for a tram line which ran through their supply area, from the City Centre to Throckley. The station was sited amid the derelict buildings of the Tyne Iron Company's ironworks. They had opened in 1797 and closed in 1886. The works were largely demolished, {{but some of the}} ironworks' buildings and <b>chimneys</b> still stood unused, and the power station was built amongst them. DisCo opened Lemington Power Station in 1903.|$|E

40|$|Anyone who is {{thinking}} of putting in a wood stove {{has a lot of}} different things to consider. One of the most important is providing a good means for getting rid of combustion gases through some type of <b>chimney.</b> This may be a masonry <b>chimney,</b> some type of prefabricated <b>chimney,</b> or it may mean the repair of a <b>chimney</b> now on the house that may not have been used for many years. All wood burning stoves need a tight, well-designed and properly constructed <b>chimney</b> to get rid of gases. This <b>chimney</b> must help in the efficient use of the stove and must also be built for safe use. Most homeowners who add a stove will either have to build a <b>chimney</b> or check to see if the existing <b>chimney</b> is in good condition...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the {{reinforced}} concrete <b>chimney</b> geometry changes and {{their influence on}} the stresses in the <b>chimney</b> mantle was made. All the changes were introduced to a model <b>chimney</b> and compared. Relations between the stresses in the mantle of the <b>chimney</b> and the deformations determined by the change of the <b>chimney's</b> vertical axis geometry were investigated. The vertical axis of <b>chimney</b> was described by linear function (corresponding to the real rotation of the <b>chimney</b> together with the foundation), and by parabolic function (corresponding to the real dislocation of the <b>chimney</b> {{under the influence of}} the horizontal forces - wind). The positive stress pattern in the concrete as well as the negative stress pattern in the reinforcing steel have been presented. The two cases were compared. Analysis of the stress changes in the <b>chimney</b> mantle depending on the modification in the thickness of the mantle (the thickness of the <b>chimney</b> mantle was altered in the linear or the abrupt way) was carried out. The relation between the stresses and the <b>chimney's</b> diameter change from the bottom to the top of the <b>chimney</b> was investigated. All the analyses were conducted by means of a specially developed computer program created in Mathematica environment. The program makes it also possible to control calculations and to visualize the results of the calculations at every stage of the calculation process...|$|R
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} {{poisoning}} include carbon monoxide detectors, proper venting of gas appliances, keeping <b>chimneys</b> clean, and keeping exhaust systems of vehicles in good repair. Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving 100% oxygen along with supportive care. This should generally {{be carried out}} until symptoms are no longer present and the HbCO level is less than 10%. While hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear. The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.|$|E
