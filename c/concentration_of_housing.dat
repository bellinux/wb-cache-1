40|$|Using {{an unusually}} rich panel {{of data on}} welfare {{recipients}} in Alameda County, California, this paper examines the importance of transportation policy variables in explaining the ability of some individuals to find gainful employment. A multinomial logit model is estimated that predicts the probability someone found {{a job as a}} function of car ownership, transit service quality, regional job accessibility by different transportation modes, human-capital factors, and various control variables. The results show that car ownership, along with educational attainment, significantly increased the odds that someone switched from welfare to work, while variables related to transit service quality were largely insignificant predictors. Nor was regional accessibility very important in explaining employment outcomes, a finding that sheds doubts about the spatial mismatch hypothesis. In terms of transit policy, what appeared to be most important in stimulating employment was the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> near bus and rail routes, a finding which lends support to transit-oriented development. However, improved automobility had far stronger effects on employment outcomes than improvements in transit mobility, at least in the case of Alameda County. Urban Studies and Planning...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} role of optimal income {{taxation}} across different local labor markets. Should labor in large cities be taxed differently than in small cities? Because {{the government needs to}} raise revenue and under free mobility there is equalization of utility, we find that optimal income taxes are typically not equal in cities of different sizes. The optimal tax schedule depends on the level of government spending and on the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> wealth. The optimal tax schedule for the US implies higher marginal rates in big cities, but lower than what is observed. Simulating the US economy under the optimal tax schedule, there are large effects on population mobility: the fraction of population in the 5 largest cities grows by 8. 0 % with 3. 5 % of the country-wide population moving to bigger cities. The welfare gains however are smaller: aggregate consumption goes up by 1. 53 %. This {{is due to the fact}} that much of the big output gains are spent on the increased costs of housing construction in bigger cities. Aggregate consumption of housing goes down by 1. 75 %...|$|E
40|$|The new Washington D. C. Convention Center {{has proven}} to be a {{catalyst}} for revitalization and improvement in Downtown D. C. The existing older Convention Center site is impeding further development along the New York Avenue corridor. This thesis proposes the construction of a dynamic mixed-use community providing varied retail options and increased housing opportunities at all income levels. A prominent new downtown landmark will also be created-a new Martin Luther King Memorial Library to replace the existing library, an outdated structure located two blocks south of the site. This thesis also explores the symbiotic relationship between object buildings and spaces-the relationship between building and place. The mixing of uses is investigated at multiple scales, working from neighborhood scale to the building scale. The idea of procession between objects and spaces is also explored- linking the object building-the new convention center to the object space, the National Mall, via a dynamic and intuitive path.

40|$|We {{increasingly}} {{understand the}} causes of urban population decline: these can be, among others, processes of deindustrialisation, decreasing fertility or the succession of a city through the stages of urban life as the city matures. However, we are still insufficiently able to explain why differences still exist between cities within regions experiencing the same macro-processes and between cities of the same ‘level of maturity’. This research addresses this intra-regional variation in population decline in the declining former mining region of Saarland (Germany). Quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed that the variation in current decline stemmed from 1) the differentiated population development trajectories of the past, with a massive population boom followed by an aged and declining population in the industrial municipalities, and 2) the spatial distribution of amenities over the region, and 3) the spatial distribution and accessibility of housing opportunities steering migration flows. These housing opportunities are not necessarily concentrated in those areas that are attractive. Rather, the distribution of these opportunities strictly follows the planning logic of the supralocal institutional framework, with a <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> along the main infrastructures and in larger centres. The case study thus reveals that the mechanisms behind this intraregional variation are much more complex than often portrayed in the urban development- and decline debate...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{work was}} {{designed}} to adapt Geographical Information System-based spatial analysis {{to the study of}} historical epidemics. We mapped "plague" deaths during three epidemics of the early 15 th century, analyzed spatial distributions by applying the Kulldorff's method, and determined their relationships with the distribution of socio-professional categories in the city of Dijon. Our study was based on a database including 50 annual tax registers (established from 1376 to 1447) indicating deaths and survivors among the heads of households, their home location, tax level and profession. The households of the deceased and survivors during 6 years with excess mortality were individually located on a georeferenced medieval map, established by taking advantage of the preserved geography of the historical center of Dijon. We searched for clusters of heads of households characterized by shared tax levels (high-tax payers, the upper decile; low-tax payers, the half charged at the minimum level) or professional activities and for clusters of differential mortality. High-tax payers were preferentially in the northern intramural part, as well as most wealthy or specialized professionals, whereas low-tax payers were preferentially in the southern part. During two epidemics, in 1400 - 1401 and 1428, areas of higher mortality were found in the northern part whereas areas of lower mortality were in the southern one. A high <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>housing</b> and the proximity to food stocks were common features of the most affected areas, creating suitable conditions for rats to pullulate. A third epidemic, lasting from 1438 to 1440 had a different and evolving geography: cases were initially concentrated around the southern gate, at the confluence of three rivers, they were then diffuse, and ended with residual foci of deaths in the northern suburb. Using a selected historical source, we designed an approach allowing spatial analysis of urban medieval epidemics. Our results fit with the view that the 1400 - 1401 epidemic was a Black Death recurrence. They suggest that this was also the case in 1428, whereas in 1438 - 1440 a different, possibly waterborne, disease was involved...|$|E
