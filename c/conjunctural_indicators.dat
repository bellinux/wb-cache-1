40|$|DSGE {{models are}} useful tools for {{evaluating}} the impact of policy changes but their use for (short-term) forecasting is still at an infant stage. Besides theory based restrictions, the timeliness of data is an important issue. Since DSGE models are based on quarterly data, they are vulnerable to a publication lag of quarterly national accounts. In this {{paper we propose a}} framework for a short-term forecasting of GDP based on a medium-scale DSGE model for a small open economy within a currency area that utilizes the timely information available in monthly <b>conjunctural</b> <b>indicators.</b> To this end we adopt a methodology proposed by Giannone, Monti and Reichlin (2009). Using Austrian data we find that the forecasting performance of the DSGE model can be improved considerably by <b>conjunctural</b> <b>indicators</b> while still maintaining the story-telling capability of the model.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{forecasting}} quarterly Austrian GDP growth using monthly <b>conjunctural</b> <b>indicators</b> and state space models. The latter provide an efficient econometric framework to analyse jointly data with different frequencies. Based on a Kalman filter technique we estimate a monthly GDP growth series as an unobserved component using monthly <b>conjunctural</b> <b>indicators</b> as explanatory variables. From a large data set {{of more than}} 150 monthly indicators the following six explanatory variables were {{selected on the basis}} of their in-sample fit and out of sample forecast performance: the ifo-index, credit growth, vacancies, the real exchange rate, the number of employees and new car registrations. Subsequently, quarterly GDP figures are derived from the monthly unobserved component using a weighted aggregation scheme. Several tests for forecasting accuracy and forecasting encompassing indicate that the unobserved components model (UOC-model) is able to outperform simple ARIMA and Naïve models. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{performance}} of Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR) for models of different size. We consider standard specifications in the macroeconomic literature based on, respectively, three and eight variables and compare results with those obtained by larger models containing twenty or over one hundred <b>conjunctural</b> <b>indicators.</b> We first study forecasting accuracy and then perform a structural exercise focused {{on the effect of}} a monetary policy shock on the macroeconomy. Results show that BVARs estimated on the basis of hundred variables perform well in forecasting and are suitable for structural analysis.

40|$|Opinion-based surveys, or {{quantitative}} surveys, {{are potentially}} very powerful tools for conjunctural analysis {{in view of}} their rapid availability and nature. This paper addresses the usefulness of these surveys for monitoring the Spanish economy. To do this it analyses {{the two most important}} opinion-based surveys, namely the European Commission's Business and Consumer Survey and the NTC-Research Purchasing Managers’ Indices, and their relationship to the Quarterly National Accounts macroeconomic data and to the Spanish economy's key <b>conjunctural</b> <b>indicators.</b> The results show that opinion-based surveys are generally useful tools for the conjunctural analysis of the Spanish economy, although they should be used with caution. Their usefulness is apparent in all the areas analysed: as indicators of economic developments, as pointers to changes in the trend of the economy and as tools for predicting the economic situation. opinion survey, short-term analysis, Spain...|$|E
40|$|The conjunctural {{information}} from monthly indicators, e. g. industrial production, retail trade turnover, M 3, confidence indicators, etc. could partly replace GDP data {{before the first}} official release is published. It is possible to incorporate monthly indicators into short-term forecasting models of GDP using quarterly bridge equations or state space models. In many cases monthly indicators are released with a lag, and GDP forecasts based on actual figures are available only shortly before the official release. To eliminate this drawback, missing observations of monthly indicators could be forecasted using simple univariate time-series models. To perform real-time analysis of the forecasting performance of bridge equations and state space models, a real-time database containing real GDP series with 28 vintages of quarterly real GDP was created. According to calculations, only bridge equations and state space models containing M 3 monthly data perform better than the benchmark ARIMA model. Both model types using M 3 provide valuable information forecast {{for the first and}} final releases of GDP. This does not mean, however, that other <b>conjunctural</b> <b>indicators</b> should not be used in forecasting, as the analysis {{does not take into account}} possible future changes in links between monthly indicators and quarterly GDP growth. bridge equations, state space model, out-of-sample forecasting, real-time database, interpolation...|$|E
40|$|Economic policy makers, {{international}} organisations and private-sector forecasters commonly use short-term forecasts of real GDP growth based on monthly indicators, such as industrial production, retail sales and confidence surveys. An {{assessment of the}} reliability of such tools and {{of the source of}} potential forecast errors is essential. While many studies have evaluated the size of forecast errors related to model specifications and unavailability of data in real time, few have provided a complete assessment of forecast errors, which should notably take into account the impact of data revision. This paper proposes to bridge this gap. Using four years of data vintages for euro area <b>conjunctural</b> <b>indicators,</b> the paper decomposes forecast errors into four elements (model specification, erroneous extrapolations of the monthly indicators, revisions to the monthly indicators and revisions to the GDP data series) and assesses their relative sizes. The results show that gains in accuracy of forecasts achieved by using monthly data on actual activity rather than surveys or financial indicators are offset {{by the fact that the}} former set of monthly data is harder to forecast and less timely than the latter set. While the results presented in the paper remain tentative due to limited data availability, they provide a benchmark which future research may build on.

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} the Belgian business cycle and forecast GDP growth based on a large data base of short-term <b>conjunctural</b> <b>indicators.</b> The data base consists of 509 indicators containing information on surveys of Belgium and its neighbouring countries, macroeconomic variables and some worldwide watched indicators such as the US ISM and OECD confidence indicators. The statistical framework used is the One-Sided Generalized Dynamic Factor Model developed by Forni, Hallin, Lippi and Reichlin (2003). The model reduces the variables to their core business cycle information, defined as the part of variation of the variables common to the data set. Well-known indicators such as the EC economic sentiment indicator and the NBB overall synthetic curve contain a high amount of business cycle information. Furthermore, {{the richness of the}} model allows to determine the cyclical properties of the series and to forecast GDP growth all within the same unified setting. We classify the variables into leading, lagging and coincident with respect to a reference business cycle defined as the common variation contained in quarter-on-quarter GDP growth. 22 % of the variables are found to be leading. Amongst the most leading variables we find asset prices and international confidence indicators such as the ISM and some OECD indicators. In general, national business confidence surveys are found to be coincident, while consumer confidence seems to lag. Although the model captures the dynamic common variation contained in the data set, forecasts based on that information are insufficient to deliver a good proxy for GDP growth given a non-negligible idiosyncratic part in GDP's variance. Lastly, we explore the dependence of the model's results on the data set and show through a data reduction process that the idiosyncratic part of GDP growth can be dramatically reduced. However, this does not improve the forecasts. Dynamic factor model, Business cycle, Leading indicators, Forecasting, Data reduction...|$|E
