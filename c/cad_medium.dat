40|$|Chemical {{signatures}} {{that can}} indicate growth medium recipes or other {{key aspects of}} the production conditions are an important goal for forensic and biodefense agencies. In this study, Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) profiles were analyzed from Bacillus thuringiensis spores grown five different published medium recipes. B. thuringiensis was chosen due to its biochemical, structural, and genetic similarity to B. anthracis, a Biosafety Level III select agent and the organisms used in the Amerithrax attacks in 2001. The relative abundance of 13 different fatty acid biomarkers, spanning four structure classes, was compared across all spore samples. Differences in the types and relative abundance of specific fatty acids was observed across each medium formulation, particularly within branched-odd and anteiso structure classes (e. g. 15 : 0 iso, 17 : 0 iso, 15 : 0 anteiso). Spore cultures also varied {{in the proportion of}} unsaturated and saturated fatty acid biomarkers. When examining specific FAME biomarkers, <b>CAD</b> <b>medium</b> showed an average abundance of 30 % for 15 : 0 iso, whereas LD 97 and Sch media showed average abundances of 23 % and 27 % respectively, and G-medium and G+Peptone exhibited average abundances of 22. 5 % and 23 % respectively for the same fatty acid. Examination of the 17 : 0 iso fatty acid showed higher average abundances of 12 % in CAD and 13. 5 % in G+Peptone, while showing lower average abundances of 10 %, 8. 5 %, and 6 % in LD, G-Medium, and Sch media respectively. Further differences in fatty acid content were also noted across the sporulation media, whereby CAD, G-Medium, and G+Peptone media exhibited an average abundance of 11. 8 %, 11. 5 %, and 11 % respectively for 15 : 0 anteiso meanwhile lower abundances of the same fatty acid were noted in LD (8. 5 %) and Sch (9 %) media. The results indicate that determining FAME profiles can be used to discriminate between a Bacillus thuringiensis species grown in different mediums, and that the amino acid content of each medium affects the FAME profile of the species in question.

40|$|New media {{throughout}} history {{have passed through}} a period of transition during which users and technologists took many years to understand and exploit the medium's potential. CAD appears to be passing through a similar period of transition, despite huge investments by vendors and users, CAD productivity remains difficult to achieve. To investigate if history can provide any insights into this problem, this thesis begins with an examination of well-known examples from history. The analysis revealed that, over time, users had developed efficient strategies which were based on powers and limitations of tools, delegation strategies exploited powers provided by tools, and circumvention strategies attempted to overcome their limitations. These insights on efficient strategies were used to investigate the CAD productivity problem based on four research questions:  1. How do architects currently use CAD systems to produce drawings?  2. What are the effects of current CAD usage on product and performance? 3. What are the possible causes of current CAD usage?  4. What are the capabilities of the <b>CAD</b> <b>medium</b> and how can they be used efficiently? The above four questions were addressed through the qualitative, quantitative, and cognitive analysis of data collected during an ethnographic study of architects working in their natural environment. The qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed that users missed many opportunities to use strategies that delegated iteration to the computer. The cognitive analysis revealed that missed opportunities to use such delegation strategies caused an increase in execution time, and an increase in errors many of which went undetected leading to the production of inaccurate drawings. These analyses pointed to plausible cognitive and contextual explanations for the inefficient use of CAD systems, and to a framework to identify and teach efficient CAD strategies. The above results were found to be neither unique to the CAD domain, nor to the office where the data were collected. The generality of these results motivated the identification of seven claims towards a general theory to explain and identify efficient strategies {{for a wide range of}} devices. This thesis contributes to the field of architecture by providing a detailed analysis of real-world CAD usage, and an approach to improve the performance of CAD users. The thesis also contributes to the field of human-computer interaction by demonstrating the generality of these results and by laying the framework for a general theory of efficient strategies which could be used to improve the performance of users of current and future computer applications. ...|$|E
40|$|Conventional CAD {{systems have}} not yet proven their ability to provide support for {{activities}} which characterise the early conceptual phase of design. We propose to refer to this set of capabilities of the human designer in conventional design as, design prototyping. We define the theoretical limitations of current CAD systems for supporting design prototyping, and postulate the potential of functionally dedicated, task related, CAD modules in Virtual Reality {{as a means to}} provide a unique form of a knowledge-based, visual design support environment for design prototyping support. We are currently engaged in a research program in which we explore <b>CAD</b> as a <b>medium</b> to support early conceptual design through rapid prototyping of architectural form. Furthermore we are exploring Virtual Reality as a potential design prototyping environment in which prototypes of designs can be constructed, communicated and visually evaluated at a high level of verisimilitude. In the first phase we have built [...] ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectivesA strong {{association}} of cytokines [interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α] with atherosclerosis is well documented. However, {{their role in}} Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp) -associated progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) is not well studied. Hence we evaluated {{the presence of these}} cytokines in CAD patients positive for Cp immunoglobulin (Ig) A (low, medium, and high levels) CAD and compared with controls. Also the physiological and baseline characteristics in IL- 6 positive CAD patients were studied. MethodsDuring the period from March 2005 to June 2007, 192 CAD patients and controls attending the cardiology clinic of Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, India were enrolled. ELISA was performed for the estimation of Cp IgA, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and cytokines IL- 6, IL- 2, and TNF-α in CAD patients and controls. ResultsIL- 6 was significantly higher in <b>CAD</b> patents with <b>medium</b> and higher Cp IgA levels (35 vs. 10 and 32 vs. 4) compared to controls. Physiological features and baseline characteristics of CAD were significantly higher in IL- 6 positive CAD patients. Additionally, in CAD patients IL- 6 was significantly correlated with hsCRP (p< 0. 001, r= 0. 42). ConclusionsOur results lead us to hypothesize the role of IL- 6 in the pathogenesis of CAD, which may subsequently get accelerated through Cp infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{longitudinal}} arterial {{movement of}} the common carotid artery (CCA) has been less investigated during the past compared to the radial movement. This is probably {{due to lack of}} an adequate measuring method. Velocity vector ultrasound imaging (VVI) now enables assessment of the longitudinal movement. The general aim of this thesis was to evaluate the potential use of VVI in assessment of CCA longitudinal wall motion. Furthermore, its clinical correlates, possible mechanisms and predictive value were evaluated in studies from man to mouse. VVI was studied from standard CCA B-mode ultrasound images in healthy volunteers, patients with established coronary artery disease (<b>CAD)</b> and in <b>medium</b> to high risk patients. All images were analyzed with specific interest of the longitudinal vessel wall {{movement of the}} far wall of the CCA. Additionally, the VVI technique was used to study the longitudinal CCA wall movement in a mouse model of atherosclerosis using high frequency ultrasound. Findings from this thesis suggest {{that it is possible to}} assess longitudinal CCA vessel wall motion with VVI technique in man with good accuracy. Patients exhibiting low total longitudinal displacement (tLoD) showed greater intima-media thickness (IMT), increased clinically determined ischemia score and area on myocardial perfusion scintigraphy examination, and decreased cardiac performance as measured by tissue velocity also determined by VVI. In patients with suspected CAD, high tLoD predicted greater one year cardiovascular (CV) event-free survival. In a separate survival analysis including patients with IMT above and below the median value, tLoD provided an incremental value above IMT in prediction of event-free survival. Finally, tLoD is also measurable in mice and low tLoD was associated with greater atherosclerotic plaque burden in mice. This thesis concludes that VVI can be used to study the longitudinal CCA vessel wall movement in both man and mouse. The tLoD seems to reflect both vessel wall structure and cardiac performance. VVI assessed longitudinal displacement has a predictive value for future short term CV events in patients with suspected CAD...|$|R
