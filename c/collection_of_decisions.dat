The <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> taken by the council, called the Stoglav, consisted mainly of questions posed by the tsar and detailed answers given by the church officials. A section titled [...] "On Scribes" [...] gave the church authorities the right to confiscate unrectified manuscripts. Thus a system of prior {{censorship of}} all publications prior to sale was established. Among other changes, the council proposed a retroactive revision of the books already in circulation.|$|E

40|$|We present {{probabilistic}} neural programs, {{a framework}} for program induction that permits flexible specification of both a computational model and inference algorithm while simultaneously enabling the use of deep neural networks. Probabilistic neural programs combine a computation graph for specifying a neural network with an operator for weighted nondeterministic choice. Thus, a program describes both a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> {{as well as the}} neural network architecture used to make each one. We evaluate our approach on a challenging diagram question answering task where probabilistic neural programs correctly execute nearly twice as many programs as a baseline model.

The <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> by all parties then determines the contract's settlement date as well as the terminal payoff for each party. We provide sufficient conditions under which a multi-person game option has a unique arbitrage price, which is additive with respect to any partition of the contract...|$|E
40|$|Agents in a multiagent system (MAS) {{can benefit}} by {{modeling}} other agents in their environment. In particular, {{being able to}} predict decisions to be taken by other agents enables an agent to improve its own utility. In this paper, we present a learning mechanism by which an agent can approximately model the decision function used by another agent given a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> made by that agent. We {{consider the case of}} binary decisions based on a single decision variable. A polynomial time, incremental algorithm to adjust the coefficients of a family of orthogonal functions, Chebychev polynomials, is presented which can be used to develop a model of other agent's decision function. We prove that, in the limit, this algorithm is guaranteed to produce an accurate model. Approximations of several interesting decision functions are presented to show the effects of limited sampling. An interesting property of the algorithm observed from the experiments is that increasing the resolution of [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{architecture}} of complex software systems is a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> {{that are very}} expensive to change. This makes effective software architecture evaluation methods essential in today’s system development for mission critical systems. We have previously developed MEMS for evaluating middleware architectures, which provides an effective assessment of important quality attributes and their characterizations. To provide additional quantitative assessments on the overall system performance using actual runtime data, we employed a set of statistical procedures in this work. Our proposed assessment procedures comprises a standard sensitivity analysis procedure that utilizes leverage statistics to identify and remove influential data points, and an estimator for evaluating system stability and a metric for evaluating system load capacity. Experiments were conducted using real runtime datasets. Results show that our procedures effectively identified and isolated abnormal data points, and provided valuable statistics to show system stability. Our approach thus provides a sound statistical basis to support software architecture evaluation. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{popularity}} of the Internet as an information source has grown extensively. Its shear expanse and convenience is ideal to disperse information. More and more online services have now become available such as online banking, e-government, e-learning and e-commerce. Our interest lies with e-learning and in particular with the delivery of course material online. Strategic management {{can be understood as}} the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> and actions taken by business management, in consultation with all levels within the organization, to determine the long-term activities of the organization. Many approaches and techniques can be used to analyze strategic cases in the strategic management process. Among them, Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis, which evaluates the opportunities, threats, strengths and weaknesses of a system, is the most common. SWOT analysis is a significant support tool for decision-making, and is commonly used as a means to systematically analyze a system’s internal and external environments. In this paper, we apply SWOT analysis to evaluate possible strategies to deliver an online course in an e-learning system. Then using probabilistic approaches we rank the strategies and select the optimal one. We present the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a case study...|$|E
40|$|The CITE-IT project employs {{information}} technologies in {{innovative ways to}} investigate the development and dissemination of precedent in the American legal system, based on {{a study of the}} issue of “regulatory takings. ” This manuscript describes the initial phases of this multidisciplinary project, specifically the methodologies we have developed to identify the corpus on which the study itself will build – all federal-level regulatory takings decisions following the 1978 Penn Central Supreme Court decision. While a comprehensive, clearly identified <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> – pertinent to a single area of law – presents a great resource for legal scholars, defining such a collection is in fact quite challenging. Using a combination of conventional research techniques and computer automation, we identified 2, 780 decisions, of which approximately 68 percent were found to be pertinent to regulatory takings law. We then developed query strategies that “triangulate ” across multiple search results to isolate “true” regulatory takings decisions within that pool (thus reducing Boundary Specification Error). Formatting features common to all decisions enabled us to automatically extract additional data (e. g., formal citation, court location, date, decisions cited), which were converted to graphica...|$|E

A distinctive feature of our approach is that we model players’ beliefs as infinite hierarchies of compact possibility sets, rather than probability measures as in the Bayesian setup.

40|$|Abstract. A {{model is}} {{analyzed}} in which agents exert {{effort to create}} innovations within an organization. When payments are infeasible, the decision on the imple-mentation of a proposal is shown {{to be made by}} simple monotonic decision rules. Organizational structure is then determined by a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> rules. A trade-off arises between the use of information and the incentives created by a rule. If the former dominates it will currently be optimal to install a hierarchy. Other-wise decentralization by granting autonomy to innovators may be better. Requiring unanimous decision-making is optimal if a strong filtering of proposals is necessary...|$|R
