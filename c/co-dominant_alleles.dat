This locus was polymorphic, showing three genotypes (Tfª Tfª, Tfª Tf b and Tf b Tf b), presumably encoded by two <b>co-dominant</b> <b>alleles,</b> Tfª and Tf b. All populations showed good genetic balance according to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, and may sustain the hypothesis of a single stock in the area investigated.

Three isozymic forms of HK, all migrating anodally, {{were present in}} all three body regions, but in differing proportions. No obvious difference in specificity for three hexose sugars was detected among the three isozymic bands.

40|$|In mating {{interactions}} in Paramecium caudatum, initial mating agglutination is strictly mating-type specific, but subsequent conjugating pair formation is not mating-type specific. Using this nonspecificity of pair formation, intersyngenic (intersibling species) pairs were induced by mixing four mating types {{of two different}} syngens. To distinguish intersyngenic pairs from intrasyngenic ones, the behavioral marker CNR (Takahashi 1979) was mainly used. Clones of intersyngenic hybrids showed high fertility and thus made feasible a genetic analysis of syngenic specificity of mating type. The syngenic specificities of E (even) mating types {{were found to be}} controlled by <b>co-dominant</b> multiple <b>alleles</b> at the Mt locus, and those of O (odd) mating types by interactions of <b>co-dominant</b> multiple <b>alleles</b> at two loci, MA and MB. Clones of heterozygotes express dual mating types. Mt is epistatic to MA and MB, and thus O mating types can be expressed only in the recessive homozygote (mt/mt) at the Mt locus. In addition, at least one allele each at the MA and MB loci must have a common syngen specificity for the expression of O types. Thus, when MA is homozygous for one syngen and MB is homozygous for another syngen, no mating type is expressed...|$|R
40|$|Microsatellite loci {{are widely}} used in {{population}} genetics for analysis of population structure, for inferring parentage, and estimating relationships. They have two features that make them very attractive for such purposes: (1) They have {{a high rate of}} mutation, leading to a large amount of variability within populations. (2) They are <b>co-dominant,</b> meaning that <b>alleles</b> contributed by both parents can be seen in their offspring – or so we usually assume. It turns out that microsatellite loci often have “null ” alleles, i. e., alleles that fail to amplify in a PCR reaction. If you’re not aware that these alleles are present, then you may mistakenly think an individual is homozygous for a particular allele, when she’s actually heterozygous for that allele and a null allele. de Sousa et al. [1] investigated this problem in Norway spruce, Picea abies. The following table shows a portion of the data they collected in their analysis. Using these data, answer the following questions...|$|R

F 1 hybrids between strains with fast forms (A/J) and strains with the slow forms (C 57 BL/ 6 J) exhibited a four-banded pattern consistent with co-dominant inheritance. The patterns observed in backcross and F 2 mice were consistent with the segregation of a pair of autosomal <b>co-dominant</b> <b>alleles.</b> Recombinant inbred strains and a congenic strain were used to show that the locus controlling γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase (Ggc) is linked to Lyt- 2, a lymphocyte alloantigen locus on chromosome 6, with an estimated map distance of 5. 0 ± 2. 5 centimorgans...|$|E
40|$|The zymograms of {{non-specific}} esterases {{in white}} skeletal muscle of Galaxias auratus and G. truttaceus are given. The electrophoretic {{patterns of the}} two species are very similar. A total of 16 bands in G. auratus and 17 in G. truttaceus was identified. Of these, 14 were common to both species. It is suggested that 14 esterase loci operate in the white muscle of both species. The loci Est 14 and Est 8 in G. auratus and Est 1, Est 4 and Est 7 in G. truttaceus appear polymorphic. Each polymorphic locus possesses two <b>co-dominant</b> <b>alleles,</b> one which codes for an electrophoretically slow isozyme, {{and the other for}} a faster migrating enzyme. The Est 8 locus of G. auratus and the Est 1 locus of G. truttaceus which code for dark staining, and therefore easily scored isozymes, appear suitable for application to population genetics studies.

40|$|The {{conservation}} of landraces in Europe is challenging because very often {{they have already}} disappeared or cannot be properly identified, which in turn prevents any possibility for their utilization. This work deals with the collection of molecular and historical data to identify and study the original landraces of common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), locally cultivated in Northern Italy (Valtellina) and to date surviving among other commercial varieties, recently introduced in the same areas of the Alps. As plant materials of F. esculentum, we analyzed a number of Italian accessions along with two foreign accessions from Poland and Nepal, {{for a total of}} 174 individuals. Molecular investigations were based on a set of eight nuclear SSR marker loci. The mean observed heterozygosity over all accessions was equal to Ho = 0. 466, being significantly lower than the expected heterozygosity (He = 0. 764). A major finding was the recognition of a marked inbreeding rate (Fit = 0. 387) and a reduced fixation index (Fst = 0. 061), indicating that most genetic variation is found within populations. A significant overall gene flow among accessions was found (Nm = 3. 846). Results indicated that only two of the examined accessions, the so-called “Nustran” and “Curunin”, could be considered, authentic Valtellina landraces. On the basis of results, we successfully developed a multi-locus marker system and identified a number of <b>co-dominant</b> marker <b>alleles</b> suitable for genetic traceability and authenticity certification of a “Nustran” and a “Curunin” autochthonous landraces of Valtellina and its food derivatives (i. e., Pizzoccheri, Polenta taragna) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the genetic pool of the West African Dwarf (WAD) goats using haemoglobin (Hb) polymorphism, as well as the association of some morphological traits with the Hb variants. Blood samples were collected from a total of 104 mature goats of both sexes belonging to the WAD breed in north central Nigeria. The red cell lysates were subjected to cellulose acetate electrophoresis and specific staining procedure to reveal the band patterns of haemoglobin. Three <b>co-dominant</b> <b>alleles,</b> causing the presence of three genotypes (AA, AB and AC) were detected among individual goats. The frequencies of the A, B and C alleles were 0. 69, 0. 30 and 0. 01, respectively. The corresponding genotype frequencies for AA, AB and AC in the goat population were 0. 37, 0. 61 and 0. 02, respectively. The discrepancy between the observed and the expected genotype number was significant (P 0. 05) by Hb variants. There is a need for further study encompassing more number of goats covering larger areas, use of DNA markers and their relationship with economic traits as well as performance study for detailed understanding of breed characteristics, conservation and genetic improvement of WAD goats in north central Nigeria. ...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that inbred Wistar-Imamichi (WI) rats are highly resistant to cadmium (Cd) -induced testicular toxicity compared to inbred Fischer 344 (F 344) rats. The {{present study was}} to elucidate the genetic background of resistance to Cd-induced testicular toxicity in WI rats. The genetic analysis of susceptibility to Cd-induced testicular toxicity was conducted, by using Cd-resistant WI and Cd-sensitive F 344 strains as the parental rats, and by using the testicular hemoglobin level as the indicator. In the frequency distribution of testicular hemoglobin levels in parental, first filial (F 1) and second filial (F 2) rats treated with Cd at a dose of 2. 0 mg/kg, F 1 rats had testicular hemoglobin levels intermediate to WI and F 344 rats, and F 2 rats segregated into three groups of low, intermediate and high phenotypes at the expected ratio. Furthermore, the backcross progeny between WI and F 1 or between F 344 and F 1 segregated into two groups with the expected ratio. Based on a simple Mendelian genetic analysis, these segregation patterns lead us to conclude that two <b>co-dominant</b> <b>alleles</b> at a gene locus are responsible for the susceptibility to Cd-induced testicular toxicity in rats. This is the first report for the genetic analysis of susceptibility to Cd-induced testicular toxicity in inbred rat strains...|$|E
40|$|The {{inheritance}} {{and relationships}} between four traits of agronomic and quality interest-fructification time, caffeine, and heteroside contents and 100 -bean weight-were analyzed {{in the first}} backcross hybrids derived from an interspecific cross between Coffea pseudozanguebariae and Coffea canephora. We showed that short vs. long fructification time was governed by one major gene with two <b>co-dominant</b> <b>alleles</b> ft 1 and ft 2. Absence vs. presence of both caffeine and heteroside was also controlled by one major gene. The allele responsible {{for the presence of}} caffeine (caf 2) dominated over the absence one (caf 1) whereas both alleles controlling heteroside, het 1 and het 2, were co-dominant. The fructification time and the heteroside content were additive while the caffeine content seemed multiplicative. The 100 -bean weight was additive and under a polygenic control. The two genes ft and caf were linked, separated by 30. 8 cM, and were independent from the het gene. The relationships between the four traits were not strong enough, except between 100 -bean weight and fructification time (r = 0. 43) or caffeine content (r = 0. 41). Recombination occurred between the genes controlling the four traits suggesting that new introgressed Robusta varieties, characterized by short, medium, or long fructification time depending on demand, bigger seeds with low or no caffeine content, and being heteroside-free, could be produced...|$|E
40|$|Background: Colour {{polymorphic}} species provide invaluable {{insight into}} processes that generate and maintain intra-specific variation. Despite an increasing {{understanding of the}} genetic basis of discrete morphs, sources of colour variation within morphs remain poorly understood. Here we use the polymorphic tawny dragon lizard Ctenophorus decresii to test simple Mendelian models for the inheritance of discrete morphs, and to investigate the genetic basis of continuous variation among individuals across morphs. Males of this species express either orange, yellow, orange surrounded by yellow, or grey throats. Although four discrete morphs are recognised, the extent of orange and yellow varies greatly. We artificially elevated testosterone in F 0 females and F 1 juveniles to induce them to express the male throat colour polymorphism, and quantified colour variation across the pedigree. Results: Inheritance of discrete morphs in C. decresii best fit a model whereby two autosomal loci with complete dominance respectively determine the presence of orange and yellow. However, a single locus model with three <b>co-dominant</b> <b>alleles</b> for orange, yellow and grey could not be definitively rejected. Additionally, quantitative expression of the proportion of orange and yellow on the throat was strongly heritable (orange: h² = 0. 84 ± 0. 14; yellow: h² = 0. 67 ± 0. 19), with some evidence for covariance between the two. Conclusions: Our study supports the theoretical prediction that polymorphism should be governed by few genes of major effect, but implies broader genetic influence on variation in constituent morph traits. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp (2 n = 22) {{is one of}} the {{important}} grain legume crops in the tropics and subtropics. The centre of diversity is in India (SMARTT, 1990), which accounts for more than 80 % of the world?s C. cajan production. Its seed is primarily consumed as dhal (dried dehusked split cotyledons) and in Latin America the tender green seeds are used as canned peas. This specie has wide adaptability to diverse climates and soils. Because of its multiple uses as food, fodder, fuel wood, rearing lac insects, hedges, windbreaks, soil conservation, roof thatches and green manure, it {{plays an important role in}} subsistence agriculture. However, the average world productivity of C. cajan is rather low (709 kg ha - 1) (FAO, 2004), indicating an urgent need for improving the genetic potential of the crop. Microsatellite markers are of high interest in C. cajan breeding programs. They are quite effective to estimate genetic diversity and genetic relationships, as well as to predict the genetic value of selected candidates derived from intraspecific crosses and the performance of their hybrid progenies. Microsatellite markers are short tandem repeat sequence motifs consisting of repeat units of 1 - 6 base pairs (bp). They are highly polymorphic DNA markers with discrete loci and <b>co-dominant</b> <b>alleles</b> (TAUTZ and SCHLOTTERER, 1994). The present study reports the characterization of 67 microsatellite markers for investigated a genetic diversity de C. cajan and cross-species amplification in other legume species. 200...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of colorectal cancer (CRC) develops through the serrated neoplasia pathway. Such tumours show a distinctive molecular phenotype of somatic BRAF mutations and widespread concordant methylation events in CpG islands (CIMP). These features are also observed in the polyps developing in individuals with hyperplastic polyposis syndrome (HPS). In HPS, multiple serrated polyps develop in the colorectum, and approximately 50 % of cases present {{with at least one}} CRC. Observations of rare affected sibships including identical twins, suggest a recessive or co‐dominant mode of inheritance. In addition, up to 50 % of individuals with HPS report a family history of CRC. At a population level, recent work has demonstrated that patients with serrated pathway cancers characterised by BRAF mutation are four {{times more likely to have}} a family history of CRC than patients with common CRC. These findings suggest an increased genetic predisposition for serrated pathway CRC in the wider population. We propose that HPS results from the inheritance of two putative <b>co‐dominant</b> <b>alleles</b> in approximately 1 in 2000 individuals. Therefore carriers of one co‐dominant allele may number up to 1 in 25, and it is likely that these carriers are at increased risk of CRC, accounting for, at least in part, the burden of serrated pathway CRC in the population. This proposition may have important implications for screening and prevention of CRC in individuals who have an increased risk for development of serrated pathway cancers, namely those with multiple, proximal, large or advanced serrated polyps, and their relatives...|$|E
40|$|Apo{{lipoprotein}}s have {{a unique}} role in lipoprotein metabolism regulation, aiding lipid transport and acting as a cofactor of the enzymes involved in metabolism. There are three <b>co-dominant</b> <b>alleles,</b> APOE* 2, APOE* 3 and APOE* 4, which encode three protein isoforms, apoE 2, apoE 3 and apoE 4. APOE* 3 is the most frequent in all populations thus far investigated, ranging from 50 to 90 %. Some studies have tried to resolve a genetic dilemma by evaluating {{the cause of the}} frequency and survival of the three alleles. Genetic drift, migration or natural selection could explain the current distribution of APOE gene frequencies worldwide. If APOE* 4 is the ancestral allele, APOE* 3 must have offered a considerable selective advantage, perhaps consisting of a positive effect during the reproductive period. Given this, {{there is a need to}} understand if APOE gene polymorphism might affect reproductive capacity. Few studies have been conducted in this area, and they generally correlate APOE polymorphism with reproductive efficiency in terms of number of children. The aim of our study was to look for correlations between APOE polymorphism in humans and semen quality, to establish if APOE genotypes have any demonstrable effect on spermatogenesis. In conclusion, our data show that APOE polymorphism is not associated with semen quality, as it is present to a similar extent in both normal and impaired or absent spermatogenesis. This demonstrates once again that the use of number of children as an index of fertility is not indicative of real male reproductive capacity...|$|E
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, is {{the most}} {{economically}} important shrimp species cultured worldwide, constituting 60 % of global shrimp production. L. vannamei has been selectively bred for commercially valuable traits such as high growth rate, survival rate, hatchery rate, and disease resistance. However, selectively bred shrimp populations are susceptible to inbreeding, resulting in reduction in phenotypic performance. To mitigate the problems of inbreeding depression, {{it is necessary to}} establish and maintain reliable shrimp pedigree for the proper management of broodstock in selective breeding programs. Microsatellite DNA markers have been indicated as the most effective genetic tool for paternity assignment in shrimp, as physical tagging and internal markers are impractical. Characteristics that contribute to microsatellite's effectiveness in paternity determination include its high variability and heritability, <b>co-dominant</b> <b>alleles,</b> its ubiquitous presence in the genome, and ease of genotyping. The main objective of this research is to determine the paternity of 9 families of shrimp progeny using 7 species-specific microsatellite DNA markers, Pvan 0013, Pvan 1003, Pvan 1758, Pvan 1815, M 1, TUGAPv 7 - 9. 115, and TUGAPv 7 - 9. 132. These microsatellites were amplified via multiplex PCR and were genotyped using an automated DNA sequencer. The raw genotyping results were analyzed and scored using the GeneMarker software. Allelic frequencies, computed simulations and paternity analysis were done using CERVUS. All but one microsatellite marker M 1 were highly polymorphic with Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) and expected heterozygosities above 0. 5, and consist of more than 4 alleles. Computer simulations suggested that assignment success rate is highly dependent on the number of loci, with assignment success of 99 % when 7 loci were used in combination. However, the assignment success rate for the actual paternity analysis was only 90 %, as a result of genotyping errors and the presence of null alleles...|$|E

40|$|Three {{isoenzyme}} systems (amylase, esterase and glutamate oxalo acetate transaminase) {{were examined}} in seeds of pea (Pisum sativum L.) and showed clear variations in their band patterns on gel electro phoresis between different lines. The inheritance of these isoenzyme systems, {{and the location of}} their structural genes on the pea genome were investigated. Reciprocal crosses were made between lines, F 2 seeds were analysed for segregation in the band patterns of the isoenzymes, and F 2 plants were investigated to find linkage between the genes for these isoenzymes and genes for selected morphological markers. The results obtained showed that each of the investigated isoenzyme systems is genetically controlled by <b>co-dominant</b> <b>alleles</b> at a single locus. The gene for amylase (Amy) was found to be on chromosome 2, linked to the loci k and wb (wb [...] . 9 -k... 25 [...] . Amy). The gene for esterase (Est) was found to be linked to the gene Br (chromosome 4) but the exact location is uncertain {{because of a lack of}} morphological markers.

Gel electrophoresis techniques have also been used to investigate genetically controlled variation in the major subunits (50, 000 Mr) of vicilin, a storage protein of Pisum sativum L.

Genetic analysis of the F 2 plants indicated that the 50, 000 Mr vicilin subunits band pattern is controlled by a pair of co-dominant genes at a single locus. The F 2 data were used to locate this major vicilin gene locus (Vc- 1) to chromoscane 7, closely linked to the r locus (for round and wrinkled seed surface). A third member of pea legumin gene family, denoted legB, has been sequenced using the "dideoxy chain termination" method with the M 1 3 sequencing system. The complete nucleotide sequence showed that this gene has a general form typical of an eukaryotic gene. The homolgies between this gene and the previously published gene "legA" 'were estimated and showed strong homology between the two genes with eight amino acid substitutions and deletion of 14 bp in the third intron (IVS- 3). The inheritance of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in (Pisum sativum L.) was investigated in a cross between two different lines, where length variation in rDNA fragments of Eco RI digests was observed. The results obtained showed that the rRNA genes are controlled by simple Mendelian system with "co-dominance" between alleles. In order to locate the rRNA gene sites to positions on the chromosomes, the segregation of ECO. RI restriction fragments of rDNA from F 2 plants with respect to genes for selected morphological markers on chromosomes 4 and 7 (the chromosomes known to have nucleolus organizer regions) were tested. The F 2 data showed no linkages between the selected markers and rRNA genes, therefore, in situ hybridization using rDNA radioactive probe ((^ 3) H- labelled rDNA clone, pHAI) and physical mapping procedures were used. The results obtained have located the rRNA gene sites to nucleolus organizer regions (satellite constrictions) at 138 and 60 map units from the centromeres of chromosomes 4 and 7, respectively...|$|E
