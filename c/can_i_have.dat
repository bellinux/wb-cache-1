Little other understanding <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> of him. The greatness and the suddenness of the misfortune doth so perplex me, until I do hear from you how the matter standeth, or how this evil should light upon me, considering what the malicious world will bruit, as I can take no rest.|$|E
25|$|My dear Miss Hamilton, What <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say? Not much indeed! But to {{wish you}} a good morning, in the pretty blue and white room where I had the {{pleasure}} to sit and read with you The Hermit, a poem which is such a favourite with me that I have read it twice this summer. Oh! What a blessing to keep good company! Very likely I {{should not have been}} acquainted with either poet or poem was it not for you.|$|E
25|$|In 1820, Godwin {{published}} Of Population: An Enquiry Concerning the Power of Increase in the Numbers of Mankind as a rebuttal to Malthus' essays. Godwin's main {{argument was}} against Malthus' notion that population tends to grow exponentially. Godwin believed that for population to double every twenty-five years (as Malthus had asserted {{had occurred in}} the United States, due to the expanse of resources available there), every married couple {{would have to have}} at least eight children, given the rate of childhood deaths. Godwin himself was one of thirteen children, but he did not observe the majority of couples in his day having eight children. He therefore concluded:In reality, if I had not taken up the pen with the express purpose of confuting all the errors of Mr Malthus’s book, and of endeavouring to introduce other principles, more cheering, more favourable to the best interests of mankind, and better prepared to resist the inroads of vice and misery, I might close my argument here, and lay down the pen with this brief remark, that, when this author shall have produced from any country, the United States of North America not excepted, a register of marriages and births, from which it shall appear that there are on an average eight births to a marriage, then, and not till then, <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> any just reason to admit his doctrine of the geometrical ratio.|$|E

500|$|At age 10, Ryder and {{her family}} moved on again, this time to Petaluma, California. During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied {{by a group of}} her peers who mistook her for an effeminate, scrawny boy. [...] "I was wearing an old Salvation Army shop boy’s suit. As I went to the {{bathroom}} I heard people saying, ‘Hey, faggot’. They slammed my head into a locker. I fell to the ground and they started to kick the shit out of me. I had to have stitches. The school kicked me out, not the bullies... Years later, I went to a coffee shop and I ran into one of the girls who’d kicked me, and she said, ‘Winona, Winona, <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> your autograph?’ And I said, ‘Do you remember me? Remember in seventh grade you beat up that kid?’ And she said, ‘Kind of’. And I said, ‘That was me. Go fuck yourself.’" [...] As a result, Ryder ended up being home-schooled that year.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1536, de la Forêt {{obtained}} {{the signature of}} a commercial treaty called Capitulations (of which only a draft has been recovered), which was the foundation for French influence in the Ottoman Empire and the Levant until the 19th century. Suleiman seemingly had some doubts about French commitment, expressing: [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> trust in him? He has always promised more than he can carry out", referring {{to the lack of}} French commitment in 1534-35, when Tunis was finally recaptured by Charles V, but he nevertheless agreed to the alliance upon Francis I's invasion of Piedmont in early 1536.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, the Humblebums broke up, with Rafferty {{going on}} to record his solo album <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> My Money Back? Connolly {{returned}} to being a folk singer. [...] His live performances featured humorous introductions that became increasingly long in duration. The head of Transatlantic Records, Nat Joseph, who had signed The Humblebums and had nurtured their career, was concerned that Connolly {{find a way to}} develop a distinctive solo career just as his former bandmate, Gerry Rafferty, was doing. Joseph saw several of Connolly's performances and noted his comedic skills. [...] Joseph had successfully nurtured the recording career of another Scottish folk entertainer, Hamish Imlach, and saw potential in Connolly following a similar path. [...] He suggested to Connolly that he drop the folk-singing and focus primarily on becoming a comedian.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} inevitably arises: [...] Did the writ subpoena {{develop in}} the Court of Eyre, or in the Court of Chancery? [...] There were writs of a somewhat similar nature {{to be found in}} both courts. [...] Bills (writs of complaints) were the method by which a litigant could make his story known in the courts of 13th and 14th century England. [...] Because novel fact patterns frequently emerged, there was a tendency to become creative in the writing of bills of complaint and writs. [...] Against this novelty, was a strong reaction, wanting to keep the number of writs to a minimum. [...] An example is seen from the time of Edward II of England: [...] in 1310–1311 John Soke, a litigant appearing in person before the Common Bench, exclaimed in great frustration, [...] "For God's sake, <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a writ to attaint this fraud?" [...] Judge Stanton replied, [...] "Make your bill and you shall have what the court can allow." [...] This illustrates the great flexibility of the writing of writs to conform to the changing fact situations as they varied from case to case. [...] At that time, a plaintiff who sued by bill was not liable to fail for defects {{in the form of a}} bill, provided the bill told an intelligible and consistent story.|$|E
