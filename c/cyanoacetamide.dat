40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} mainly deals with l,l-enediamines and ~ -substituted enamines (push-pull olefines) and their reactions, leading to the {{formation}} of a number of heterocycles. Various ~-substituted enamines were prepared by a 'one pot synthesis' in which a l,l-enediamine presumably acts as an intermediate. These enamines, various substituted crotonamides and propenamides, were made by using two different orthoesters, various secondary and primary amines and <b>cyanoacetamide.</b> Their structures, mechanism of formation and geometry are discussed. A synthetic route to various unsymmetrically substituted pyridines was examined. Two substituted pyridinones were obtained by using two different ~-substituted enamines and <b>cyanoacetamide.</b> In one case a dihydropyridine was isolated. This dihydropyridine, on heating in acidic conditions, gave a pyridinone, which confirmed this dihydropyridine as an intermediate in this pyridine synthesis. A new synthetic method was used to make highly substituted pyridinones, which involved the reaction of l,l-enediamines with the ~-substituted enamines. A one pot synthesis and an interrupted one pot synthesis were used to make these pyridinones. Two different orthoesters and three different secondary amines were used. Serendipitous formation of a pyrimidinone was observed when pyrrolidine was used as the secondary amine and triethyl orthopropionate was used as the orthoester. In all cases <b>cyanoacetamide</b> was used as the carbon acid. This pyridine synthesis was designed with aI, l-enediamine as the Michael donor and the ~ -substituted enamines as Michael acceptors.

40|$|The Knoevenagel {{reaction}} {{is defined by}} the condensation of an aldehyde or ketone with a carbon nucleophile produced by the deprotonation of a methylene species whose acidity is dramatically increased by bonds to strongly electron withdrawing groups. Previously, our group developed an effective one-pot method for the preparation of 4 H-chromenes using sodium borohydride reduction of the cyclized intermediates formed by the Knoevenagel condensation of malononitrile with salicylaldehydes in aqueous ethanol. In this study we outline the extension of these strategies to include 2 ’-hydoxyphenylketones as the starting material. Many of these compounds are also unique and were prepared by Friedel-Crafts acylation of phenols with acyl chlorides and/or Fries Rearrangement of the corresponding phenyl ester. The objective of this project has been to expand the application of the methods optimized in our lab for the simple and efficient formation of carbon-carbon bonds via the selective reduction of the alkylidene portion of the Knoevenagel reaction products. These methods have allowed for the production of several important classes of natural product-like compounds.
