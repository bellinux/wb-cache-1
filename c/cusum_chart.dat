50|$|It {{turns out}} that Shewhart charts are quite good at {{detecting}} large changes in the process mean or variance, as their out-of-control ARLs are fairly short in these cases. However, for smaller changes (such as a 1- or 2-sigma change in the mean), the Shewhart chart does not detect these changes efficiently. Other types of control charts have been developed, such as the EWMA chart, the <b>CUSUM</b> <b>chart</b> and the real-time contrasts chart, which detect smaller changes more efficiently by making use of information from observations collected prior {{to the most recent}} data point.|$|E
40|$|The {{cumulative}} sum (<b>CUSUM)</b> <b>chart</b> {{is a very}} effective control charting procedure used for the quick detection of small-sized and moderate-sized changes. It can detect small process shifts missed by the Shewhart-type control chart, which is sensitive mainly to large shifts. To further enhance {{the sensitivity of the}} CUSUM control chart at detecting very small process disturbances, this article presents CUSUM control charts based on well-structured sampling procedures, double ranked set sampling, median-double ranked set sampling, and double-median ranked set sampling. These sampling techniques significantly improve the overall performance of the <b>CUSUM</b> <b>chart</b> over the entire process mean shift range, without increasing the false alarm rate. The newly developed control schemes do not only dominate most of the existing charts but are also easy to design and implement as illustrated through an application example of real datasets.

A Phase II nonparametric <b>CUSUM</b> <b>chart</b> based on the exceedance statistics, called the exceedance <b>CUSUM</b> <b>chart,</b> is proposed here for detecting {{a shift in the}} unknown location parameter of a continuous distribution. The exceedance statistics can be more efficient than rank-based methods when the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed and/or right-skewed, which may be the case in some applications, particularly with certain lifetime data. Moreover, exceedance statistics can save testing time and resources as they can be applied as soon as a certain order statistic of the reference sample is available. Guidelines and recommendations are provided for the chart’s design parameters along with an illustrative example.

Methods: Albumin was selected as the surrogate protein marker for the product to be tested and the coefficient of dispersion (COD) calculated as the measure of homogeneity. To detect changes in the average level of homogeneity, cumulative sum control (<b>cusum)</b> <b>charts</b> were used. Results: The COD(%) for each triplicate reading of albumin obtained from 34 specimens was normally distributed with a mean of 0. 49 % and a standard deviation of 0. 25 %.
