40|$|The {{neutrino}} flux {{detected in}} the C 1 -Ar experiment seems {{to respond to the}} powerful solar <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> <b>bursts.</b> The ground-based detectors, the balloons and the satellites detect about 50 % of the <b>bursts</b> of soalr <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> generated on the Sun's visible side.

The detection of solar-flare-generated gamma-quanta with energies above tens of Mev is indicative of the generation of high-energy particles which in turn may produce neutrinos.

40|$|<b>Cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> <b>bursts</b> (CRBs) from mergers or {{accretion}} induced {{collapse of}} neutron stars that hit an Earth-like planet closer than ∼ 1 kpc from the explosion produce lethal fluxes of atmospheric muons at ground level, underground and underwater.

The mean rate of such life devastating CRBs is one in 100 million years (Myr), consistent with the observed 5 "great" extinctions in the past 600 Myr. Unlike the previously suggested extraterrestrial extinction mechanisms the CRBs explain massive life extinction on the ground, underground and underwater and the higher survival levels of radiation resistant species and of terrain sheltered species. More distant mergers can cause smaller extinctions. Biological mutations caused by ionizing radiation produced by the CRB may explain a fast appearance of new species after mass extinctions. The CRB extinction predicts detectable enrichment of rock layers which formed during the extinction periods with cosmogenically produced radioactive nucleides such as ^ 129 I, ^ 146 Sm, ^ 205 Pb with and ^ 244 Pu.

40|$|The {{technical}} {{details of}} a radiation measuring system based on a quartz torsion fiber electroscope and a pressurized ionization chamber are described. This equipment is designed to measure the radiation intensity from the carbon- 14 contained in a sample introduced into the system as carbon dioxide. This system, including the shielding, is shown {{to be capable of}} measuring nuclear radiations of extremely low intensities, on the order of 1 / 200 of the normal laboratory background level, with a probable error of approximately l%. The background radiation intensity observed with the system including the shielding is also on the order of 1 / 200 of the normal laboratory background level. The nature of background radiation and its relation to the measurement of such low intensities is discussed. It is shown that the main limitation in accuracy, with the equipment described here, is due to <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> <b>bursts.</b> It is also shown that the major source of background radiation is external to the equipment, being thus due to <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> and/or local external gamma ray emitting material contamination.

The main conclusion which may be drawn from these results is that the selection of an equipment location is very effective in reducing the level of background radiation, thus permitting the measurement of radiation fields of extremely low intensity.
