The production characteristics and similarities found between the modes of production of these products, the cultural and historical aspects that approximate these cheeses produced in two geographically distant regions in Brazil, provide elements to discuss the role of traditional foods as promoters of rural development strategies. In this article, our aim is to emphasize the debate around the potential of connection between consumers and producers towards organization and <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> short <b>circuits</b> <b>of</b> production and distribution of traditional foods. In the limit, the debate we propose points out the role of these spaces or local markets - alternative to the hegemonic ones - in rural development strategies.

40|$|In the CNS, synapse {{formation}} and maturation play crucial {{roles in the}} construction and <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> neuronal <b>circuits.</b> Neurexin and neuroligin localize on the opposite sides of synaptic membrane and {{interact with each other}} to promote the assembly and specialization of synapses. However, the excitatory synapses induced by the neurexin-neuroligin complex are initially immature synapses that lack AMPA receptors. Previously, PICK 1 (protein interacting with C kinase 1) was shown to cluster and regulate the synaptic localization of AMPA receptors. Here, we report that during synaptogenesis induced by neurexin in cultured neurons from rat hippocampus, PICK 1 recruited AMPA receptors to immature postsynaptic sites. This synaptic recruitment of AMPA receptors depended on the interaction between GluA 2 and PICK 1, and on the lipid-binding ability of PICK 1, but not the interaction between PICK 1 and neuroligin. Last, our results demonstrated that the recruitment of GluA 2 to synapses could be prevented by ICA 69 (islet cell autoantigen 69 kDa), a key binding partner of PICK 1. Our study showed that PICK 1, being negatively regulated by ICA 69, could facilitate synapse maturation...|$|R

40|$|Sleep can {{favor the}} <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> both {{procedural}} and declarative memories, promote gist extraction, help {{the integration of}} new with old memories, and desaturate the ability to learn. It is often assumed that such beneficial effects are due to the reactivation <b>of</b> neural <b>circuits</b> in sleep to further strengthen the synapses modified during wake or transfer memories to {{different parts of the}} brain. A different possibility is that sleep may benefit memory not by further strengthening synapses, but rather by renormalizing synaptic strength to restore cellular homeostasis after net synaptic potentiation in wake. In this way, the sleep-dependent reactivation <b>of</b> neural <b>circuits</b> could result in the competitive down-selection of synapses that are activated infrequently and fit less well with the overall organization of memories. By using computer simulations, we show here that synaptic down-selection is in principle sufficient to explain the beneficial effects of sleep on the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> procedural and declarative memories, on gist extraction, and on the integration of new with old memories, thereby addressing the plasticity-stability dilemma...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> {{services}} {{is a widely}} accepted technique for IaaS Cloud providers to reducing energy consumption and improving the utilization of their resources. This technique is based on distributing all services in the minimum amount of servers. This way, the overall energy consumption of the datacenter is reduced, as less servers are needed to be active. Traditionally, {{research has focused on}} strategies for <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> Virtual Machines (VMs), but containers are changing the landscape of Cloud services. Containers are expected to optimize the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> services by reducing the amount of needed resources, thus allocating more services using less servers. However, while multiple research works have been produced in the Energy Efficiency (EE) achieved through <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> VMs, there is yet no experimental work on how <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers affects EE, when assuming a given Quality-of-Service (QoS) to the user. In this paper we show an experimental analysis on the effects <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers in the QoS and EE, compared to the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> VMs. We demonstrate that the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers is indeed more optimal than the one of VMs, both in terms of QoS and EE. Consecutively, we analyze how the degradation of the service is produced both in QoS and EE, and we show how QoS is the variable which is more affected by consolidation. This work provides the necessary scientific background on <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> two widely used virtualization technologies, and we believe it is useful for future works on the optimization of resources in datacenters...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacture involves an electrolytic copper deposition stage for <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> conductive <b>circuit</b> paths. Miniaturisation trends requiring increased circuit densities and high aspect ratio through-holes are restricted by the phenomenon of non-uniform copper electrodeposit thickness which can affect electrical impedance properties of the circuitry, cause electrical discontinuity between adjoining circuit layers and inhibit component-lead insertion. This thesis considers means of enhancing the electrodeposition process to alleviate the aforementioned problems. Following {{a comprehensive review of}} process technology, both a novel electrolyte agitation method utilising eductors and a Periodic Pulse Reverse (PPR) current technique were investigated experimentally within a pilot tank containing 350 litres of electrolyte. Eductor agitation was analysed/optimised using high-speed photography and a mass transport mapping technique. Data for agitation configurations were verified by statistical analysis of thickness distributions across high surface-area panels. PPR current was initially studied with a small-scale pulse unit and Assaf Cell throwing power test, followed by pilot tank trials using a full-size pulse rectifier in conjunction with eductor agitation and a proprietary electrolyte containing additives. Through-hole throwing power, deposit morphology and microstructure were investigated under various low-frequency pulse conditions and anodic-to-cathodic current density ratios. Eductor agitation and PPR current were compared against the more widely used air agitation and direct current techniques. The effects of air agitation on electrolyte conductivity and commercially produced PCBs were also considered. Optimum agitation conditions were achieved using eight eductors inclined at 37. 5 ° from the horizontal and spaced equidistantly along longitudinal tank walls. Such conditions decreased the standard deviation of copper thickness measured on high surface area panels and lessened edge-effects. Consistent agitation levels up to ten times greater than static solution were recorded, providing enhanced deposition rates; by comparison, air agitation achieved levels of around seven times in uniform regions. Conductivity data showed good correlation with a theoretical approach; air agitation was found to reduce conductivity in proportion to the voidage fraction of gas bubbles and by 20 - 30...|$|R
