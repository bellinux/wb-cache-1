40|$|Motivation. Chain ladder {{forecasts}} {{are notoriously}} volatile for immature exposure periods. The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method is one commonly used alternative but needs a priori estimates of ultimate losses. Berquist and Sherman presented another alternative that used claim counts as an exposure base and used trended incremental severities to “square the triangle. ” A significant {{advantage of the}} Berquist and Sherman method is the simultaneous estimate of underlying inflation. Though {{not the first to}} do so, this paper looks to extend the incremental severity method to a stochastic environment. Rather than using logarithmic transforms or (generalized) linear models, used in many other approaches, we use maximum likelihood estimators, bringing to bear the strength of that approach avoiding limiting assumptions necessitated when taking logarithms. Method. Given that incremental severities can be looked at as averages over a number of claims, the law of large numbers would suggest those averages follow an approximately normal distribution. We then assume the variance of the incremental payments in a cell are proportional to a power of the mean (with the constant of proportionality and power constant over the triangle). We then use maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) to estimate the incremental severities, along with the inherent <b>claims</b> <b>inflation</b> to “square the triangle. ” We also use properties of MLEs to estimate the variance-covariance matrix of the parameters, giving not only estimates of process but also of parameter uncertainty for this method.

The idea is that quantum fluctuations allow the field to jump uphill, thereby continually revitalizing the inflationary process in some regions. In this paper we investigate a simple model of this process, pertaining to inflation with a quartic potential, in which analytic progress may be made. We calculate several quantities of interest, such as the expected number of inflationary efolds, first without and then with various selection effects. With no additional weighting, the stochastic noise has little impact on {{the total number of}} inflationary efoldings even if the inflaton starts with a Planckian energy density. A "rolling" volume factor, i. e. weighting in proportion to the volume at that time, also leads to a monotonically decreasing Hubble constant and hence no eternal inflation.

40|$|This paper {{tests for}} the long-run and short-run {{relationship}} between prices and wages in the Irish economy over the 1975 - 92 period. Using recent econometric techniques {{in the analysis}} of time series, we conclude that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between prices, wages and an excess demand variable in agreement with the expectations augmented Phillips curve theory of inflation. Making use of error-correction equations in order to study the short-run dynamics, we find that the long-run relationship between prices and wages is due to Granger causality running from wage inflation to price inflation. In addition, the predictive ability of excess demand is weak with respect to wage inflation but very strong with respect to price inflation. These results imply (a) relatively strong evidence in favour of a mark-up price equation consistent with the expectations augmented Phillips curve theory of inflation, and (b), very weak evidence for the predictive power of past inflation and the output gap for wages, i. e., a wage-type Phillips curve effect. In other words, the results provide strong support for the <b>claim</b> that <b>inflation</b> in Ireland has cost-push elements and very weak support for the existence of demand-pull elements. ...|$|R
