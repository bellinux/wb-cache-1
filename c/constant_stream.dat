5|$|In another work of Shakespeare, Othello (1603), it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that he has made another reference. In act 5, scene 2 the main character Othello compares himself to a myrrh tree with its <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> of tears (Myrrha's tears). The reference is justified in the way that it draws inspiration from Book X of Ovid's Metamorphoses, just like his previously written poem, Venus and Adonis, did.|$|E
5|$|The art of mother-of-pearl carving {{is said to}} {{have been}} a Bethlehem {{tradition}} since the 15th century when it was introduced by Franciscan friars from Italy. A <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> of pilgrims generated a demand for these items, which also provided jobs for women. The industry was noted by Richard Pococke, who visited Bethlehem in 1727.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{embankment}} began on September 16, 1968 using the hydraulic fill method. The dam's massive concrete emergency spillway was completed on January 19, 1969. However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam {{and all of}} the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule. Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> of dirt and rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of one and a half feet (0.5 m) per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service spillway was completed. On May 28, 1970, {{the embankment}} was finally topped out with the last of over 250,000 truckloads of material.|$|E

5|$|Patrolling by the Australians {{continued}} {{in order to}} prevent the Chinese from harassing their forward positions. Small clashes occurred on the nights of 15/16, 21/22, 22/23 and 23/24 July, suggesting that the Chinese were preparing for a major attack. Aerial reconnaissance subsequently detected a build up of Chinese forces and supplies west of the Samichon River. In response the Australians and US Marines stepped up their defensive preparations, {{while at the same time}} rumours from the peace talks started to spread of a ceasefire. Regardless, Chinese harassing artillery and mortar fire intensified, causing a <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> of casualties among the Australians. Intense Chinese shelling struck Hill 121 and The Hook on the night of 19/20 July, with more than 300 rounds wounding four members of C Company, 2 RAR and further damaging the defences. That night the US Marines were driven off the Berlin and East Berlin features on the left flank, further exposing The Hook, which became a salient. Yet on 21 July an expected Chinese assault in the US 5th Marine Regiment sector failed to occur, while sightings of Chinese troops across the US 1st Marine Division front declined as the fighting entered a lull.|$|E

50|$|The streams which {{traverse}} it {{are mere}} winter torrents, which descend {{from the southern}} chain but scarcely reach the sea. The Pedias (Pediaeus) and lalias (Yialias, Idalias) lose most of their floodwaters in the marshes about Salamis, near the Bay of Famagusta. The Pedias rises nearMachaira and passes close to Nicosia, indeed flowed through it before the river was diverted by the Venetians. The lalias rises very near {{the source of the}} Pedias, passes through Nisou, Dali (the ancient Idalion) and Pyroi, and traverses the Mesaoria in a direction more or less parallel with the Pedias.

5000|$|Siena did not prosper under Roman rule. It was not sited near {{any major}} roads and lacked {{opportunities}} for trade. Its insular status meant that Christianity did not penetrate until the 4th century AD, {{and it was}} not until the Lombards invaded Siena and the surrounding territory that it knew prosperity. [...] After the Lombard occupation, the old Roman roads of Via Aurelia and the Via Cassia passed through areas exposed to Byzantine raids, so the Lombards rerouted much of their trade between the Lombards' northern possessions and Rome along a more secure road through Siena. Siena prospered as a trading post, and the <b>constant</b> <b>streams</b> of pilgrims passing to and from Rome provided a valuable source of income in the centuries to come.|$|R
50|$|The {{mangroves}} include tall trees, up to 30m.

East African mangrove species are similar to those found on other coasts around the Indian Ocean. The Bazaruto Archipelago is an example of offshore mangroves sheltered by coral and intermingled with a mixture of shoreline habitats such as grassy sand dunes and rockpools.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the initial}} assault, the Ottoman {{defenders}} {{continued to hold}} very strong defensive positions, with each redoubt ideally placed to provide supporting fire for others. In most places the dismounted attackers were badly exposed to this fire. A <b>constant</b> <b>stream</b> of fire was maintained on the Ottoman parapets to suppress the defenders and prevent them from taking aim while the attack continued. Little by little the cordon drew tighter under intense fire over the bare, gently-sloping grasslands. However, between about 12:15 and 14:15 progress slowed.|$|E

A deep ravine, or rather a perpendicular chasm of the rocks, of frightful depth, surrounded three parts of the city; through this flowed the Rio Verde, or Green River. There were two suburbs to the city, fortified by walls and towers, and almost inaccessible from the natural asperity of the rocks.

25|$|The widespread, {{frequent}} use of acronyms across {{the whole range of}} registers is a relatively new linguistic phenomenon in most languages, becoming increasingly evident since the mid-20th century.

30|$|The studies {{covered in}} this section are also on data {{gathered}} from the patient level and again have the intention of answering clinical level questions. Instead of predicting the patient’s condition in the future (i.e. ICU readmission or 5 year survival), the research here will be using data streams in order to predict patient’s conditions in real-time. Data streams are never ending torrents of data that requires continuous analysis giving the possibility for real-time results (a feature not available when using static data sets). This section will sample two different categories of data steam studies: making prognosis and diagnosis predictions for patients, and detecting if a new born is experiencing a cardiorespiratory spell both in a real time.

40|$|News {{sources on}} the Web {{generate}} <b>constant</b> <b>streams</b> of information, describing {{many aspects of}} the events that shape our world. In particular, geography {{plays a key role in}} the news, and enabling geographic retrieval of news articles involves recognizing the textual references to geographic locations (called toponyms) present in the articles, which can be difficult due to ambiguity in natural language. Toponym recognition in news is often accomplished with algorithms designed and tested around small corpora of news articles, but these static collections do not reflect the streaming nature of online news, as evidenced by poor performance in tests. In contrast, a method for toponym recognition is presented that is tuned for streaming news by leveraging a wide variety of recognition components, both rule-based and statistical. An evaluation of this method shows that it outperforms two prominent toponym recognition systems when tested on large datasets of streaming news, indicating its suitability for this domain...|$|R
