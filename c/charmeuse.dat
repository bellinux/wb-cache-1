60|$|The {{doctor was}} still saying these words when a violent and {{ultimately}} disastrous struggle began between Sir Richmond {{and the little}} <b>Charmeuse</b> car. The doctor stopped in mid-sentence.|$|E
60|$|For half an {{hour after}} the {{departure}} of the little <b>Charmeuse</b> car with Sir Richmond and Dr. Martineau, the brass Mercury lay unheeded in the dusty roadside grass. Then it caught the eye of a passing child.|$|E
60|$|Nellie {{was on her}} father's arm, daintily attired {{in white}} <b>charmeuse</b> with her tulle veil trimmed in orange blossoms, and her girl friends {{declared}} {{that she was the}} prettiest bride they had ever seen. The ceremony was a short one, and at the conclusion Tom gave his bride such a hearty smack that every one present had to smile.|$|E
60|$|Sir Richmond {{had arrived}} nearly forty minutes late, {{and it would}} have been evident to a much less highly trained {{observer}} than Dr. Martineau that some dissension had arisen between the little, ladylike, cream and black <b>Charmeuse</b> car and its owner. There was a faint air of resentment and protest between them. As if Sir Richmond had been in some way rude to it.|$|E
60|$|Everything went on smoothly. Mrs. Kearney {{bought some}} lovely blush-pink <b>charmeuse</b> in Brown Thomas's to let {{into the front}} of Kathleen's dress. It cost a pretty penny; but there are {{occasions}} when a little expense is justifiable. She took a dozen of two-shilling tickets for the final concert {{and sent them to}} those friends who could not be trusted to come otherwise. She forgot nothing, and, thanks to her, everything that was to be done was done.|$|E
6000|$|It was speedily {{apparent}} that Sir Richmond was an experienced and excellent driver. He took the <b>Charmeuse</b> {{out into the}} traffic of Baker Street and westward through brisk and busy streets and roads to Brentford and Hounslow smoothly and swiftly, making a score of unhesitating and accurate decisions without apparent thought. There was very little conversation until they were through Brentford. Near Shepherd's Bush, Sir Richmond had explained, [...] "This is not my own particular car. That was butted into at the garage this morning and its radiator cracked. So I had {{to fall back on}} this. It's quite a good little car. In its way. My wife drives it at times. It has one or two constitutional weaknesses--incidental to the make--gear-box over the back axle for example--gets all the vibration. Whole machine rather on the flimsy side. Still--" ...|$|E
60|$|Tuppence was {{ushered into}} a room {{on the right of}} the long passage. A woman was {{standing}} by the fireplace. She was no longer in her first youth, and the beauty she undeniably possessed was hardened and coarsened. In her youth she must have been dazzling. Her pale gold hair, owing a slight assistance to art, was coiled low on her neck, her eyes, of a piercing electric blue, seemed to possess a faculty of boring into the very soul of the person she was looking at. Her exquisite figure was enhanced by a wonderful gown of indigo <b>charmeuse.</b> And yet, despite her swaying grace, and the almost ethereal beauty of her face, you felt instinctively the presence of something hard and menacing, a kind of metallic strength that found expression in the tones of her voice and in that gimlet-like quality of her eyes.|$|E
60|$|The little <b>Charmeuse</b> was towed to {{hospital}} and the two psychiatrists took up their quarters at the Radiant Hotel with its pleasant lawns and graceful landing stage at the bend towards the bridge. Sir Richmond, after some trying work at the telephone, got into touch with his own proper car. A man would bring the car down in two days' time at latest, and afterwards the detested coupe {{could go back to}} London. The day was still young, and after lunch and coffee upon a sunny lawn a boat seemed indicated. Sir Richmond astonished the doctor by going to his room, reappearing dressed in tennis flannels and looking very well in them. It occurred to the doctor as a thing hitherto unnoted that Sir Richmond was not indifferent to his personal appearance. The doctor had no flannels, but he had brought a brown holland umbrella lined with green that he had acquired long ago in Algiers, and this served to give him something of the riverside quality.|$|E
60|$|A gust of {{confidence}} {{on the part}} of a person naturally or habitually reserved will often be followed by a phase of recoil. At breakfast next morning their overnight talk seemed to both Sir Richmond and Dr. Martineau like something each had dreamt about the other, a quite impossible excess of intimacy. They discussed the weather, which seemed to be settling down to the utmost serenity of which the English spring is capable, they talked of Sir Richmond's coming car and of the possible routes before them. Sir Richmond produced the Michelin maps which he had taken out of the pockets of the little <b>Charmeuse.</b> The Bath Road lay before them, he explained, Reading, Newbury, Hungerford, Marlborough, Silbury Hill which overhangs Avebury. Both travellers discovered a common excitement at the mention of Avebury and Silbury Hill. Both took an intelligent interest in archaeology. Both had been greatly stimulated by the recent work of Elliot Smith and Rivers upon what was then known as the Heliolithic culture. It had revived their interest in Avebury and Stonehenge. The doctor moreover had been reading Hippisley Cox's GREEN ROADS OF ENGLAND.|$|E
60|$|Sir Richmond's car arrived {{long before}} ten, {{brought down by}} {{a young man in}} a state of scared alacrity--Sir Richmond had done some {{vigorous}} telephoning before turning in,--the <b>Charmeuse</b> set off in a repaired and chastened condition to town, and after a leisurely breakfast our two investigators into the springs of human conduct were able to resume their westward journey. They ran through scattered Twyford with its pleasant looking inns and through the commonplace urbanities of Reading, by Newbury and Hungerford's pretty bridge and up long wooded slopes to Savernake forest, where they found the road heavy and dusty, still in its war-time state, and so down a steep hill to the wide market street which is Marlborough. They lunched in Marlborough and went on in the afternoon to Silbury Hill, that British pyramid, the largest artificial mound in Europe. They left the car by the roadside and clambered to the top and were very learned and inconclusive about the exact purpose of this vast heap of chalk and earth, this heap that men had made before the temples at Karnak were built or Babylon had a name.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Charmeuse</b> (...) is a {{lightweight}} fabric woven with a satin weave, {{in which the}} warp threads cross over four {{or more of the}} backing (weft) threads. These float threads give the front of the fabric a smooth finish—lustrous and reflective—whereas the back has a dull finish. It can be made of silk or a synthetic lookalike such as polyester. Silk <b>charmeuse</b> is more expensive and delicate but is softer and a better insulator. [...] Polyester <b>charmeuse</b> is cheaper and can often withstand machine washing, but it does not breathe as well as silk. <b>Charmeuse</b> differs from plain satin in that <b>charmeuse</b> has a different ratio of float (face) threads.|$|E

5000|$|The luster and {{delicate}} hand make <b>charmeuse</b> suited to lingerie, flowing evening gowns, and drapey blouses. Bridal gowns sometime use charmeuse; however, the fabric {{does not hold}} a shape well, {{so it is not}} used for full, flared skirts; the <b>charmeuse</b> tends to cling and hang against the body. It is best suited to a more fluid, slinky bias cut, and drapes well.|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} materials {{which are}} considered erotic are <b>charmeuse</b> silk (silk woven {{so that it}} has a sheen) and satins (such as acetate satin and rayon satin), but other materials with similar properties, such as spandex and polyester are also admired.|$|E
5000|$|Many slips have floral lace at the hem {{and/or the}} [...] "vents" [...] or [...] "sideslits". Some {{of the older}} slips have decorations, such as a {{butterfly}} or flowers sewn {{into the fabric of}} the slip, and a pillowtab was also added to the waistband of a waist slip. The vast majority of slips are made of 100% nylon, while others are made from polyester, rayon, acetate, silk or in some cases cotton. Still, there are others made of blends, and the label of the garment might read, for example, [...] "40% nylon, 35% rayon, 25% polyester". Nylon slips are often shiny in appearance, and are very smooth to the touch, while polyester slips can even be more shiny with a real slippery feel, especially <b>charmeuse</b> or [...] "satin" [...] slips. Although <b>charmeuse</b> slips have very attractive eye appeal, they are not as durable as nylon slips, and often tear very easily, especially when wet.|$|E

50|$|Red wedding saris are the {{traditional}} garment choice for brides in Indian culture. Sari fabric is also traditionally silk. Over time, colour options and fabric choices for Indian brides have expanded. Today fabrics like crepe, Georgette, <b>charmeuse,</b> and satin are used, and colors have been {{expanded to include}} gold, pink, orange, maroon, brown, and yellow as well. Indian brides in Western countries often wear the sari at the wedding ceremony and change into traditional Indian wear afterwards (lehnga, choli, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Sonia, Robert {{and their}} son Charles {{returned}} to Paris permanently in 1921 and moved into Boulevard Malesherbes 19. The Delaunays' most acute financial problems were solved when they sold Henri Rousseau's La <b>Charmeuse</b> de serpents (The Snake Charmer) to Jacques Doucet. Sonia Delaunay made clothes for private clients and friends, and in 1923 created fifty fabric designs using geometrical shapes and bold colours, commissioned by a manufacturer from Lyon. Soon after, she started her own business and simultané became her registered trademark.|$|E
5000|$|A slip {{dress is}} a woman's dress that closely resembles an underslip or petticoat. It is {{traditionally}} {{cut on the}} bias, with spaghetti straps. Slip dresses first became widely worn {{in the last decade}} of the 20th century, as part of the underwear-as-outerwear trend, when they were made from layered chiffon, polyester satins and <b>charmeuse,</b> and often trimmed with lace. The slip dress looked like an undergarment, but was intended to be seen, and through the use of lace and sheer elements, offer glimpses of the body beneath.|$|E
5000|$|... "Tout c'qui nous sépare" [...] (English: [...] "All That Separates Us") is a 1991 pop song {{recorded}} by French singer Jil Caplan, released as CD single in March 1991. It {{was the first}} single from her second studio album, La <b>Charmeuse</b> de serpents, released a few months earlier, on which it appeared as second track. Written and composed by Jay Alansky, the song became a top ten hit in France and remains Caplan's most successful single in terms of sales and chart performances. It was later included on the singer's 1998 greatest hits album, Jours de fête.|$|E
50|$|When woven from {{polyester}} {{it can be}} {{a challenging}} fabric to sew; it tends to be slippery and may be difficult to control through the presser foot of a sewing machine. Seams have a tendency to pucker and pull; a smaller stitch length and properly balanced tensions can minimize this, though the experience of the sewer will affect the finished result as well. Pins can make holes and marks in polyester <b>charmeuse</b> so it's very important to use proper sharp dressmakers pins with a smooth, not abrupt, taper to the point. For greater ease of sewing, a sizing product can be sprayed on before cutting and washed out after the garment is completed.|$|E

50|$|The Austrian curtain or Austrian drape, {{also called}} a puff curtain, has {{multiple}} vertical and usually nylon lines distributed evenly across {{the length of}} the fabric (often a thin satin, <b>charmeuse,</b> or chiffon material that bunches up well). Each of these lines runs through a pulley {{at the top of the}} curtain and then over to a head block. From there, they each lead and down to a mechanical winch necessary to raise the curtain which is typically much too heavy for one person to raise. As the winch turns and curtain rises, it is collected in a series of swags accentuated by horizontal pleats called festoons sown into the curtain from top to bottom. In this sense, it has both vertical and horizontal fullness. Austrian curtains reached their height of popularity in the mid twentieth century. They are visually considered very aesthetic, require little fly space overhead, and are relatively simple to operate as long as the winch can bear the load. However, they are very complex to rig and are usually the most expensive kind of curtain to construct.|$|E
