40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the new electoral law voted and enacted {{in the spring}} of 2015, which reintroduced the plurinominal vote, regarding the election the senators and deputes, not by uninominal election, but by voting a party-list.

Because of the new electoral laws, the logic and the old political customs, related to the illegal financing of the political parties, will be forgotten, due to the donors’ obligation to be transparent. By the new electoral law, the Permanent Electoral Authority is the institution qualified to perform the control of the income and expenses of the parties and electoral alliances, but also on the revenues realized during the campaign, offered by creditors and donors, but transactions can only be made by bank <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> or payment <b>order,</b> thus conferring discipline and public transparence on the financing of political organizations and on the debts and loans stored by the parties. ...|$|R

Half the students were enrolled on Arts modules; the remainder of students were studying modules in Maths, Computing and Technology. The findings of this research reveal differences between these groups of students in terms of the origins of their past credit, the quantity of past <b>credit</b> they <b>transfer</b> {{and the ways in which}} their current studies are connected to future plans and aspirations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} advance our {{understanding}} of the <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> phenomenon in the UK, specifically how students draw on a credit as a form of institutional cultural capital. Drawing on interviews with twenty-six part-time mature learners this paper examines the progressive and retrospective orientations to study that surfaced in students’ accounts of <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> and their life-long learning journeys. A common theme of “unfinished business” appeared to dominate these accounts and a narrative-oriented analysis of the findings revealed the role of <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> in enabling students to complete varied personal projects or forms of “unfinished business”. The findings of this work suggest that in an increasingly complex higher education market {{there is a need to}} understand students’ strategic use of the credit they accumulate. In particular, this paper explores how <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> features in the narratives of students’ successful learning journey...|$|R
