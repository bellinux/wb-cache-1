5000|$|Merely to {{say that}} a lens is [...] "C-mount" [...] says very little about the lens' {{intended}} use. <b>C-mount</b> lenses have been made for many different formats. <b>C-mount</b> lenses are built for the 8 mm and 16 mm film formats and the 1/3", 1/2", 2/3", 1", and 4/3" [...] video formats, which corresponds to a range of image circles approximately from 5 to 22 mm in diameter.|$|E

40|$|Imaging {{spectrometry}} has mainly been {{a research}} tool, employing laboratory spectrographs and scientific cameras. This paper describes an add-on imaging spectrograph {{that provides a}} unique combination of high quality image in a small, rugged, industrial, easy-to-use component. The spectrograph {{is based on a}} prism/grating/prism (PGP) dispersing element which provides straight optical axis, astigmatism free image and polarization independent throughput. A volume holographic transmission grating is used for high efficiency (up to 70 %). The tubular optomechanical construction of the spectrograph is stable and small, D 30 x L 110 mm with F/ 2. 8 numerical aperture and 2 / 3 inch image size. Equipped with <b>C-mounts,</b> the spectrograph plugs between lens and area camera, converting the camera to a spectral line imaging system. The spectrograph allows the utilization of rapidly developing monochrome camera techniques, like high speed digital cameras, smart cameras and CMOS sensors, in color and spectral analytical applications. It is the first component available for upgrading existing industrial monochrome vision systems with color/spectral capability without the need to change the basic platform hardware and software. The spectrograph brings the accuracy of spectral colorimetry to industrial vision and overcomes the complex calibration that is needed when an RGB color camera is applied to colorimetric applications. Other applications include NIR imaging (up to 2500 nm), spectral microscopy, multichannel fiberoptic...|$|R

50|$|Although <b>C-mount</b> lenses have a back focal {{distance}} far {{too short to}} be used with 35 mm film SLRs or any existing digital SLR, they can be mounted on interchangeable-lens mirrorless digital cameras. One such system is the Micro Four Thirds, being used by Olympus and Panasonic. However, the vast majority of <b>C-mount</b> lenses produce an image circle too small to effectively cover the entire (micro-)four-thirds sensor, which has approximately 22 mm diagonal. This produces what is popularly called vignetting but is better described as a mismatch between camera format and lens format.|$|E
50|$|Among users, Beaulieu {{became known}} for its SLR-style motion picture cameras. These cameras had {{removable}} <b>C-mount</b> lenses, and a reflex type viewfinder (both features uncommon in this smaller format).|$|E
5000|$|The shorter flange focal {{distance}} means that most manual lenses {{can be adapted}} for use, though <b>C-mount</b> lenses have a slightly shorter flange {{focal distance}} and are trickier to adapt.|$|E
50|$|CS-mount has {{a flange}} focal {{distance}} of 12.50 mm, but is otherwise {{the same as}} <b>C-mount,</b> {{including the fact that}} lenses for many different formats are made for it. CS-mount lenses are built for the smaller formats, 1/2 inch and down.|$|E
50|$|The short FFD of the Pentax Q enables it {{to accept}} manual focus lenses from many {{manufacturers}} (via adapters) including Nikon F, Leica M and 39M, Olympus OM, Canon FD, Minolta, M42 screw mount, <b>C-Mount,</b> D-Mount, Pentax K, Pentax Auto 110, and Pentax 6×7.|$|E
5000|$|The short FFD of the Pentax Q series enables lenses {{from many}} {{manufacturers}} to {{be adapted to}} it, including: Olympus OM, Canon FD, Minolta, M42 screw mount, M39 Leica, <b>C-Mount,</b> D-Mount, Pentax K, and Pentax 6×7. [...] A Pentax adapter with a synchronized shutter for Pentax K-mount lenses was released in October 2012.|$|E
5000|$|<b>C-mount</b> lenses {{provide a}} male thread, which mates {{with a female}} thread on the camera. The thread is {{nominally}} 1.000 in in diameter, with 32 threads per inch, designated as [...] "1-32 UN 2A" [...] in the ANSI B1.1 standard for unified screw threads. The flange focal distance is 17.526 mm for a C mount.|$|E
50|$|However, in {{the domains}} of {{professional}} and semi-professional photography, {{as well as in}} the domain of special cameras, interchangeable optics are often used. In these cases, a system specialist has to adapt the optics and the chip to the application (see System integration). Besides normal lenses, such interchangeable lenses may be microscopes, endoscopes, telescopes, etc. With the exception of the standard <b>C-mount</b> and CS-mount, the mounts of interchangeable optics are company-specific.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Iscoramas were discontinued {{at the end}} of the 1970s, {{by which}} point in time ISCO had released the Cinegon <b>C-Mount</b> Cine lens, plus the Iscorama 36 and Iscorama 54 screw-in anamorphic adapters, and the associated Iscostat projection mount system. These new stand-alone adapters were a tacit acknowledgement of the fact that many ISCO customers were mounting the front element of the original Iscorama detachable monobloc onto other manufacturers' taking lenses.|$|E
50|$|A {{lens mount}} {{may be a}} screw-threaded type, a bayonet-type, or a breech-lock (friction lock) type. Modern still camera lens mounts are of the bayonet type, because the bayonet {{mechanism}} precisely aligns mechanical and electrical features between lens and body. Screw-threaded mounts are fragile and do not align the lens in a reliable rotational position, yet types such as the <b>C-mount</b> interface are still widely in use for other applications like video cameras and optical instrumentation.|$|E
5000|$|Autovision I, 1981, {{designed}} for fast time to market, {{was based on}} Vision Module technology licensed from Stanford Research Institute (SRI). The AV I used an early Motorola 68000 KDM prototype board interfaced to a Unibus frame grabber board purchased from SRI. The frame grabber was {{designed for}} the General Electric TN-2200, an early solid state video camera with a 128 by 128 pixel array and <b>C-mount</b> lens. DECtape II drives were used for program and data storage.|$|E
50|$|The Iscorama Cinegon was {{an updated}} version of the {{original}} 1968 Iscorama, designed specifically for the Cine market. It comprised an 1.8 10mm <b>C-Mount</b> taking lens, plus a detachable 1.5× stretch anamorphic adapter. This adapter appeared to be visually identical to the front section of the original Iscorama, but actually had a much larger 36mm diameter rear anamorphic element, which offered improved vignetting performance when the adapter was attached to third-party taking lenses. Like the original 1968 Iscorama, all Cinegons were single coated.|$|E
50|$|A {{lens mount}} is an {{interface}} — mechanical and often also electrical — between a photographic camera {{body and a}} lens. It is confined to cameras where the body allows interchangeable lenses, most usually the rangefinder camera, single lens reflex type or any movie camera of 16 mm or higher gauge. Lens mounts are also used to connect optical components in instrumentation that may not involve a camera, such as the modular components used in optical laboratory prototyping which join via <b>C-mount</b> or T-mount elements.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the short}} native flange {{distance}} of the Micro Four Thirds System, the usage of adapted lenses from practically all formats has become widely popular. Because lenses can be used from old and abandoned camera systems, adapted lenses typically represent good value for the money. Adapters ranging from low- to high-quality are readily available for purchase online. Canon FD, Nikon F (G lenses require special adapters), MD/MC, Leica M, M42 Screw Mount, and <b>C-mount</b> Cine lenses {{to name a few}} are all easily adaptable to the Micro Four Thirds system with glassless adapters resulting in no induced loss of light or sharpness.|$|E
5000|$|The Paillard-Bolex H-16 {{usually has}} a turret for three <b>C-mount</b> lenses. Often, {{the camera was}} {{provided}} with a 16mm Switar or Yvar, a 25mm Switar or Yvar and the third lens was often a 75mm Yvar or 50mm Switar. It {{should be noted that}} only lenses with the designation [...] "RX" [...] in 50 mm or less can be used on the RX models. RX corrected lenses were also manufactured by Schneider, Berthiot, Angénieux, and Rodenstock. The single lens port H-16 M(arine) was made in conjunction with the first underwater housing. A second, later marine housing was made for the electric drive models.|$|E
50|$|Flange focal {{distance}} {{is one of}} the most important variables in a system camera, as lens seating errors of as little as 0.01 mm will manifest themselves critically on the imaging plane and focus will not match the lens marks. Professional movie cameras are rigorously tested by rental houses regularly to ensure the distance is properly calibrated. The most common mount is the Arri PL mount with an FFD of 52.00 mm. The Russian OCT-19 has an FFD of 61.00 mm. <b>C-mount</b> (Bolex, éclair and Bell & Howell) has 17.52 mm. Any discrepancies between eye focus and measured focus which manifest them&shy;selves across a range of distances within a single lens may be collimation error with the lens, but if such discrepancies occur across several lenses, it is more likely to be the flange {{focal distance}} or the groundglass (or both) which are mis-set.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{retained}} the same lens mount on the Swiss made cameras from 1942 until they ended production. The back {{focus of the}} body was the thinnest of any 35 mm camera, and as a result, {{it was possible to}} make adapters to use lenses designed for almost any other 35 mm SLR on an Alpa. Adapters offered included Exakta, M42 (automatic diaphragm and manual), Nikon (auto and manual), Leicaflex, T-mount, and Contax. Other adapters included one to allow mounting Alpa lenses to <b>C-mount</b> movie cameras and another to mount the Alpa bodies to a microscope. Alpa did not make their own lenses, and sourced them through some of the best lens makers—Angenieux, Kern, Kinoptik, Schneider, and others. They were the only company to guarantee optical quality of the lenses they sold. The clearness of the pentaprism in the Alpa models, and the use of [...] "rings" [...] of different surfaces in the eyepiece of the 11 series especially made them a great choice for using on a T-mount, attached to large telescopes. Coupled with the manual mirror raise switch, even the vibration of the mirror slap was removed.|$|E
40|$|The package {{structure}} critically {{influences the}} major characteristics of semiconductor lasers, such as thermal behavior, output power, wavelength, and far-field distribution. In this paper, a new single emitter package structure called F-mount is designed and {{compared with the}} conventional package structure <b>C-mount.</b> The influence of package structure on their performances is characterized and analyzed. The thermal resistances of lasers with different package structures are calculated through simulation, and are contrasted with experimental results. Some devices are also tested for the maximum output power level. Under the continuous wave (CW) condition, the maximum power of F-mount reaches 12. 6 W at 808 nm while the output power only reaches 10. 9 W for <b>C-mount.</b> Under the condition of 0. 5 % duty cycle (100 mu s, 50 Hz), the catastrophic optical mirror damage level reaches 58. 7 W at 74 A for F-mount, and 54. 8 W at 57 A for <b>C-mount</b> are reported for the first time. It is experimentally found {{that there is an}} obvious wavelength difference between the two type structure lasers: about 1. 37 nm in CW mode and 2. 89 nm in quasi CW mode. Theoretical analysis shows that red-shift and blue-shift is a result of external strain in the package process of F-mount and <b>C-mount,</b> respectively. It is also found that the package structure has an effect on the divergence angle of slow axis far fields, but little impact on that of fast axis far fields. The analysis shows that package structure has a strong influence on the performance of the laser; therefore, the package should be optimized to achieve better performance for some special applications...|$|E
40|$|A {{new series}} of video {{measurements}} were made of the phenomenon provisionally termed the cloud-to-stratosphere (CS) event, an electrical discharge extending to great heights above thunderstorm tops. This {{new series of}} measurements were accomplished by properly positioning a sensor, the Xybion model ISS 225 low-light monochrome imaging system with a <b>C-mount</b> fl. 8 manual zoom lens, and training it on the appropriate portion of the sky above a distant thunderstorm complex mean Fort Collins, Colorado. The resulting images are currently undergoing intensive analysis. Some tentative conclusions are given. Cloud-to-stratosphere events occur far more frequently than previously suspected and are perhaps a ubiquitous aspect of many larger convective systems. Cloud-to-stratosphere events are also of substantial horizontal extent, {{on the order of}} tens of kilometers in some cases...|$|E
40|$|Low cost {{monochrome}} camera systems {{based on}} CMOS sensors and <b>C-mount</b> lenses {{have been successfully}} applied {{to a wide variety}} of metrology tasks. For high accuracy work such cameras are typically equipped with ring lights to image retro-reflective targets as high contrast image features. Whilst algorithms for target image measurement and lens modelling are highly advanced, including separate RGB channel lens distortion correction, target image circularity compensation and a wide variety of detection and centroiding approaches, less effort has been directed towards optimising physical target image quality by considering optical performance in narrow wavelength bands. This paper describes an initial investigation to assess the effect of wavelength on camera calibration parameters for two different camera bodies and the same ‘C-mount’ wide angle lens. Results demonstrate the expected strong influence on principal distance, radial and tangential distortion, and also highlight possible trends in principal point, orthogonality and affinity parameters which are close to the parameter estimation noise level from the strong convergent self-calibrating image networks...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{high-speed}} Single-Photon Camera for demanding applications in biology, astrophysics, telecommunications, 3 D imaging and security surveillance. The camera {{is based on}} a 32 -by- 32 array of "smart pixels" processed in a standard high-voltage technology. Every pixel is a completely independent photon-counting channel. Sensitivity is at the single-photon level and no readout noises affect the measure. The camera has high Photon-Detection Efficiency (PDE) in the blu/green visible spectrum (45 % at 450 nm) and low Dark-Counting Rate (DCR) even at room temperature (usually lower than 2 kcps). The use of microlenses makes it possible to further increase the effective pixel fill-factor. The camera can be configured by means of a cross-platform user-friendly software that communicates with the camera through a fast USB link. The integration time window may range from few tens of nanoseconds to milliseconds. The maximum frame rate for the whole 1, 024 pixels is about 100 kframe/s, while the minimum 20 ns dead-time between frames boosts the sensor dynamic range. The camera is equipped with a standard <b>C-Mount</b> connector. A gating input pin can be used to quickly gate on/off the integration. The camera works in One-Shot mode for the maximum acquisition speed, Real-Time mode for very long measurements and Live mode for setups alignment purposes...|$|E
40|$|For many photogrammetric {{applications}} involving bundle adjustments, it {{is desirable}} to have a priori knowledg of the lens distortions, both radial and decentering. For close range applications involving focussing, other interior orientation parameters of principal distance {{and the location of}} the principal point may not be well known. A technique has been developed to determine the parameters of radial and decentering lens distortions for the simple style (as distinct from the more complex zoom) <b>C-mount</b> lenses used with an array of CCD cameras for digital photogrammetry at City University, London. It has been shown previously that the parameters of decentering distortion and the offsets of the principal point are highly correlated in convergent bundle adjustments, so the only remaining unknown of the interior orientation is the principal distance (Fryer and Fraser, 1986). Initially, a set of taut string-lines were imaged and used to precisely determine the radial and decentering distortions for the lenses at several camera to object distances. A modification of this technique {{in the form of a}} rectangular frame which is imaged with the object, or just prior to the measurement of the object, has proved a quick and reliable way to obtain accurate values of lens distortion at the moment of data capture. 1.

40|$|This year’s Boise State Microgravity University team is {{building}} a system which will excite osteocyte mono-cultures and osteocyte-osteoblast co-cultures with 350 nm light and then image the emission for free calcium or bound calcium at 485 nm and 405 nm, respectively. In order to image these wavelengths, the system built needed enough resolution to image a 5 mm diameter well of a microtiter 96 well plate and to differentiate between wells in close proximity since all 96 wells fit into a 3 x 5 inch area. This made imaging and image post processing difficult due to bleed over from one well to the next. Another complexity {{of the system is}} that it needed to image these wells during a 30 s period of micro or hyper gravity, requiring the exposure time and time between captures to be small. The imager itself needed to be sensitive enough that it can capture the specific wavelengths without introducing unnecessary noise even though the signal will not have significant luminosity. The team used two different mono-chrome imagers using <b>C-mount</b> band-pass filters in order to isolate both 405 nm and 485 nm emissions simultaneously with one imager per wavelength. After capturing the images, post-processing will be performed utilizing digital image filtering and manipulation methods to determine how much luminosity from each well was caused by unbound or bound dye, allowing a quantification of free calcium. The team expects that, as with last year’s cells, there will be a definite correlation between the gravitational stress on the cells to the amount of free calcium in each well...|$|E
40|$|Semiconductor lasers with {{emission}} in {{the range}} 790 - 880 nm are in use {{for a variety of}} application resulting in different laser designs to fulfill requirements in output power, operation temperature and lifetimes. The output power is limited by self heating and catastrophic optical mirror damage at the laser facet (COMD). Now we present data on bars fabricated with our new facet technology, which enables us to double the maximum facet load. We present q-cw laser bar with 80 % fill factor with increased power level to 350 W in long term operation at 200 s and 100 Hz. The COMD limit of the bar is as high as 680 W. Using Quantel's optimized packaging stacks with 11 bars of 5 mm widths are tested at up to 120 A resulting over 66 % power conversion efficiency at 1600 W output power. Laser bars for continuous wave operation like 50 % fill factor bars had an COMD limit of approx. 250 W with conventional facet technology, the value is equivalent to 10 W per 200 m emitter (conditions: 200 s). The new facet technology pushes the facet stability to 24 W/emitter. The new process and an improved design enable us to shift continuous wave operation at 808 nm from 100 W to 150 W/bar with lifetimes of several thousand hours at 30 °C using DILAS mounting technology. Higher power is possible depending on lifetime requirements. The power conversion efficiency of the improved devices is as high as 62 % at 200 W cw. The next limitation of 8 xxnm lasers is high temperature operation: Values of 60 - 80 °C are common for consumer applications of single emitters. Therefore Osram developed a new epitaxial design which reduced the generation of bulk defects. The corresponding Osram single emitters operate at junction temperatures up to 95 °C, a value which corresponds to 80 °C heat sink temperature for lasers soldered on <b>C-mount</b> or 65 °C case temperature for lasers mounted in TO can. Current densities of the single emitter broad area lasers are as high as 1. 4 kA/cm 2 at 850 nm emission wavelength...|$|E
40|$|Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are {{the most}} {{advanced}} technologies to fight road accidents. Within ADAS, an important role is played by radar- and lidar-based sensors, which are mostly employed for collision avoidance and adaptive cruise control. Nonetheless, they have a narrow field-of-view and a limited ability to detect and differentiate objects. Standard camera-based technologies (e. g. stereovision) could balance these weaknesses, but they are currently not able to fulfill all automotive requirements (distance range, accuracy, acquisition speed, and frame-rate). To this purpose, we developed an automotive-oriented CMOS single-photon camera for optical 3 D ranging based on indirect time-of-flight (iTOF) measurements. Imagers based on Single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays offer higher sensitivity with respect to CCD/CMOS rangefinders, have inherent better time resolution, higher accuracy and better linearity. Moreover, iTOF requires neither high bandwidth electronics nor short-pulsed lasers, hence allowing the development of cost-effective systems. The CMOS SPAD sensor is based on 64 × 32 pixels, each able to process both 2 D intensity-data and 3 D depth-ranging information, with background suppression. Pixel-level memories allow fully parallel imaging and prevents motion artefacts (skew, wobble, motion blur) and partial exposure effects, which otherwise would hinder the detection of fast moving objects. The camera is housed in an aluminum case supporting a 12 mm F/ 1. 4 <b>C-mount</b> imaging lens, with a 40 °× 20 ° field-of-view. The whole system is very rugged and compact and a perfect solution for vehicle’s cockpit, with dimensions of 80 mm × 45 mm × 70 mm, and less that 1 W consumption. To provide the required optical power (1. 5 W, eye safe) and to allow fast (up to 25 MHz) modulation of the active illumination, we developed a modular laser source, based on five laser driver cards, with three 808 nm lasers each. We present the full characterization of the 3 D automotive system, operated both at night and during daytime, in both indoor and outdoor, in real traffic, scenario. The achieved long-range (up to 45 m), high dynamic-range (118 dB), highspeed (over 200 fps) 3 D depth measurement, and high precision (better than 90 cm at 45 m), highlight the excellent performance of this CMOS SPAD camera for automotive applications. © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of defects (scratches and impacts) {{is vital}} to the certification of flight hardware and other critical components. The amount of damage to a particular component contributes to the performance, reliability, and safety of a system, which ultimately affects {{the success or failure of}} a mission or test. The launch-commit criteria on a Space Shuttle Orbiter window are governed by the depth of the defects that are identified by a visual inspection. This measurement of a defect is not easy to obtain given the environment, size of the defect, and location of the window(s). The determination of depth has typically been performed by taking a mold impression and measuring the impression with an optical profiling instrument. Another method of obtaining an estimate of the depth is by using a refocus microscope. To use a refocus microscope, the surface of the glass and bottom of the defect are, in turn, brought into focus by the operator. The amount of movement between the two points corresponds to the depth of the defect. The refocus microscope requires a skilled operator and has been proven to be unreliable when used on Orbiter windows. White light interferometry was chosen as a candidate to replace the refocus microscope. The White Light Interferometer (WLI) was developed to replace the refocus microscope as the instrument used for measuring the depth of defects in Orbiter windows. The WLI consists of a broadband illumination source, interferometer, detector, motion control, displacement sensor, mechanical housing, and support electronics. The illumination source for the WLI is typically a visible light emitting diode (LED) or a near-infrared superluminescent diode (SLD) with power levels of less than a milliwatt. The interferometer is a Michelson configuration consisting of a 1 -in. (2. 5 -cm) cube beam splitter, a 0. 5 -in. (1. 3 -cm) optical window as a movable leg (used to closely match the return intensity of the fixed leg from the window), and a mirrored prism to fold the optics into the mechanical housing. The detector may be one of many <b>C-mount</b> CCD (charge-coupled device) cameras. Motion is provided by a commercial nanostepping motor with a serial interface. The displacement sensor is a custom device specifically designed for this application. The mechanical housing and support electronics were designed to integrate the various components into an instrument that could be physically handled by a technician and easily transported...|$|E
