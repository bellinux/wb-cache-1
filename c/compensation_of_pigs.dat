2500|$|Another {{negative}} effect <b>of</b> the <b>pig</b> cull on the Zabbaleen was {{the loss of}} the economic value <b>of</b> the <b>pigs</b> themselves. According to Fahmi and Sutton, pigs are the main source of income for the Zabbaleen. Before the cull, the Zabbaleen had collected 6,000 tons of MSW daily, of which 60 percent was organic waste which was consumed by the pigs. Every six months, the Zabbaleen would take their pigs to traders, earning around 450LE (approximately 80 USD) per pig. Although the Egyptian government made financial <b>compensations</b> for some <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> slaughtered; <b>compensations</b> were not given to all of the Zabbaleen who lost pigs to the cull and those who received compensation received far less money compared to what they would have received [...] from selling the pigs to traders. According to one Zabbaleen pig breeder, [...] "The government paid me between LE 50 (US$ 10) and LE 250 (US$ 50) for each pig I lost, depending on its size, whilst meat processors would have given me as much as LE 1,000 (US$ 200)." [...] The pig cull also resulted in increased cases of malnutrition and anaemia in Zabbaleen children because prior to the cull, pork had been the only affordable source of animal protein for most of the Zabbaleen.|$|R

In this study we analyze the determinants of the location <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production in Denmark with particular focus on spatial externalities and the interaction between the location <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production and upstream sector and slaughterhouses. It is the assumption that the location of slaughterhouses is influenced by the location of the primary producers, implying that this variable is endogenous, whereas the location of primary producers is independent of the location of slaughterhouses. This is due to the fact that transportation costs <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> are paid by the cooperatives owning the slaughterhouses. This assumption is tested applying a spatial econometric model. The model is estimated for 1999 and 2004. Furthermore, the impact of negative environmental externalities <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production on location is analyzed.

The objectives of this study were to describe the transmission dynamics <b>of</b> JEV among <b>pigs</b> in northwestern Bangladesh and estimate the potential impact of vaccination to reduce incidence among pigs. We conducted a comprehensive census <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> in three JE endemic districts and tested a sample of them for evidence of previous JEV infection. We built a compartmental model to describe JEV transmission dynamics in this region and to estimate the potential impact <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> vaccination.
