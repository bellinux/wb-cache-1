50|$|Autophagy is {{the major}} {{intracellular}} degradation system delivering cytoplasmic components to lysosomes, and it accounts for degradation of most long-lived proteins and some <b>organelles.</b> <b>Cytoplasmic</b> constituents, including <b>organelles,</b> are sequestered into double-membraned autophagosomes, which subsequently fuse with lysosomes.

Structures targeted for autophagic destruction are sequestered into newly emerging double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, and delivered for lysosomal degradation. Despite recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, a long-standing question concerning {{the source of the}} autophagic membrane remains unresolved.

30|$|In {{concomitant}} {{with the}} previous results, ROS generation may be a radical factor underlying TBT toxicity. Multitude of studies (Demir et al., 2011; Mitra et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014; Bernat et al., 2014) {{have suggested that the}} generation of ROS, including the species derived from H 2 O 2 such as OH·, is one of the mechanisms involved in TBT toxicity. ROS cause damage to mitochondrial and other <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelle</b> membrane structures through peroxidation of phospholipids, proteins and nucleotides. Consequently, membrane stability and integrity being disrupted resulting in osmolality changes and hydropic cell degeneration (Guo et al., 2013). Meanwhile, lipid peroxidation activates endonuclease enzymes, with subsequent breakdown of nuclear DNA and nuclear degeneration (Zhang et al., 2016).|$|R
40|$|Acid {{hydrolase}} {{activities are}} normally confined within the cell to the lysosome, a membrane-delimited <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelle</b> {{primarily responsible for}} the degradation of macromolecules. However, lysosomal proteins are also present in human plasma, and a proportion of these retain mannose 6 -phosphate (Man- 6 -P), a modification on N-linked glycans that is recognized by Man- 6 -P receptors (MPRs) that normally direct the targeting of these proteins to the lysosome. In this study, we purified the Man- 6 -P glycoforms of proteins from human plasma by affinity chromatography on immobilized MPRs and characterized this subproteome by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by tandem mass spectrometry. As expected, we identified many known and potential candidate lysosomal proteins. In addition, we also {{identified a number of}} abundan...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Formation of {{the nuclear}} pore is an {{intricate}} process involving membrane fusion and the ordered assembly of up to 1, 000 pore proteins.

Interestingly, annulate lamellae, a <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelle</b> consisting of stacks of flattened membrane cisternae perforated by numerous pore complexes, have been found to form spontaneously in a reconstitution system derived from Xenopus egg extracts, as determined by electron microscopy (Dabauvalle et al., 1991). In this work, a biochemical assay for annulate lamellae (AL) formation was developed and used to study the mechanism of AL assembly in general and the assembly of individual nucleoporins into pore complexes in particular.

By means of the same technique, what may be parts of another <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelle,</b> the annulate lamellae (2), has also been discovered. These usually consist of a number of parallel, double-membraned sheets, each of which structually closely resembles the nuclear envelope. Such structural complexes, however, appear to have a more limited distribution than the endoplasmic reticulum (see review in 3), and thus far have been predominantly observed in oocytes. Among the problems associated with this new cytoplasmic entity are its ultrastructure, organization, distribution, site of origin and functional significance. The preliminary observations reported in this paper will be concerned with some of these questions...|$|R
40|$|How {{organelle}} biogenesis and inheritance {{is linked}} to cell division is poorly understood. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the G(1) cyclins Cln 1, 2, 3 p control initiation of cell division. Here we show that Cln 3 p controls vacuolar (lysosomal) biogenesis and segregation. First, loss of Cln 3 p, but not Cln 1 p or Cln 2 p, resulted in vacuolar fragmentation. Although the vacuoles of cln 3 delta cells were fragmented, together they occupied a large space, which accounted for a significant fraction of the overall cell size increase in cln 3 delta cells. Second, cytosol prepared from cells lacking Cln 3 p had reduced vacuolar homotypic fusion activity in cell-free assays. Third, vacuolar segregation was perturbed in cln 3 delta cells. Our findings reveal a novel role for a eukaryotic G(1) cyclin in <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelle</b> biogenesis and segregation...|$|R
40|$|We report three-photon laser {{scanning}} microscopy (3 PLSM) using a bi-directional pumped optical parametric oscillator (OPO) with signal wavelength output at λ= 1500 nm. This novel laser was used to overcome the high optical loss in the infrared spectral region observed in {{laser scanning}} microscopes and objective lenses that renders them otherwise difficult to use for imaging. To test our system, we performed 3 PLSM auto-fluorescence imaging of live plant cells at λ= 1500 nm, specifically Spirogyra, and compared performance with two-photon excitation (2 PLSM) imaging using a femtosecond pulsed Ti:Sapphire laser at λ= 780 nm. Analysis of cell viability based on <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelle</b> streaming and structural changes of cells revealed that at similar peak powers, 2 PLSM caused gross cell damage after 5 min but 3 PLSM showed little or no interference with cell function after 15 min.

Metal-haematein stains are available also for objects other than nuclei, including myelin sheaths of nerve fibres and various <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelles.</b> The color of the stained objects depends on the salt used.

40|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum, the <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelle</b> that matures {{a massive}} amount of nascent secretory polypeptides, is particularly sensitive to stress. Endoplasmic reticulum stress causes unfolded proteins to populate the organelle, eliciting the unfolded protein response. During the unfolded protein response, GRP 78 —an endoplasmic reticulum master stress regulator—detaches from three endoplasmic reticulum stress sensors (IRE 1 α, PERK, and ATF 6) and allows them to activate the apoptotic signaling pathway. Fortilin, a pro-survival molecule, is known to inhibit apoptosis by binding and inhibiting p 53, but its role in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis remains unknown. Here, we report that fortilin directly interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of IRE 1 α, inhibits both kinase and endoribonuclease (RNase) activities of the stress sensor, and protects cells against apoptotic cell death at both cellular and whole animal levels. Our data support a role of fortilin in the unfolded protein response and its potential participation in human diseases caused by unfolded protein response...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian Langerhans cells (LC) are {{epidermal}} dendritic cells which {{originate in}} bone marrow and migrate toward the T cell area of lymph nodes, where {{they act as}} professional antigen-presenting cells. A variety of cell surface markers, such as the ectoenzyme adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), Ia and CD 1 a antigens, have been used extensively to identify LC. Ultrastructural identification of this cell type in the mammalian epidermis is made by the demonstration of a typical and unique <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelle,</b> the Birbeck granule (BG). Although we had earlier demonstrated the coexpression of ATPase and Ia antigens on epidermal dendritic cells of the chicken epidermis, {{the presence of the}} BG has not previously been documented.

40|$|Germline cysts are {{clusters}} of germ cells that arise by division {{from a single}} cell and are connected to one another by stable intercellular bridges. Cysts are a highly conserved stage of pre-meiotic germ cell development, but the molecular mechanisms that control their formation are highly unknown. Developing cysts in Drosophila contain a <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelle</b> called a fusome, which plays {{a critical role in}} cyst formation. The SCAR gene, which encodes an actin regulatory protein, was identified in a screen for mutations that disrupt fusomes and cyst formation. It was not clear, however, if the mutation l(2) k 03107 disrupts only SCAR. To address this question, new alleles were created by excising the P-element in l(2) k 03107. These alleles were then characterized molecularly and phenotypically. The results show that two alleles have deletions in the SCAR gene. Further testing must be done to determine the role of SCAR in cyst formation...|$|R
50|$|The LINC complex (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) is {{a protein}} complex {{associated}} with both {{inner and outer}} membranes of the nucleus. It is composed of SUN-domain proteins and KASH-domain proteins. The SUN-domain proteins are associated with both nuclear lamins and chromatin and cross the inner nuclear membrane. They interact with the KASH-domain proteins in the perinuclear (lumen) space between the two membranes. The KASH domain proteins cross the outer nuclear membrane and interact with actin filaments, microtubule filaments (through dynein and kinesin motors), intermediate filaments (through spectrin), centrosomes and <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelles.</b> The number of SUN-domain and KASH-domain proteins increased in evolution.|$|E
50|$|Metabolism ceases, and {{the cells}} are almost {{completely}} filled by keratin. During {{the process of}} epithelial differentiation, cells become cornified as keratin protein is incorporated into longer keratin intermediate filaments. Eventually the nucleus and <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelles</b> disappear, metabolism ceases and cells undergo a programmed death as they become fully keratinized. In many other cell types, such as cells of the dermis, keratin filaments and other intermediate filaments function {{as part of the}} cytoskeleton to mechanically stabilize the cell against physical stress. It does this through connections to desmosomes, cell-cell junctional plaques, and hemidesmosomes, cell-basement membrane adhesive structures.|$|E
5000|$|The exact {{cause of}} IOI is unknown, but {{infectious}} and immune-mediated mechanisms have been proposed. Several studies have described cases where onset of orbital pseudotumor was seen simultaneously or {{several weeks after}} upper respiratory infections. Another study by Wirostko et al. proposes that organisms resembling Mollicutes cause orbital inflammation by destroying the <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelles</b> of parasitized cells. [...] Orbital pseudotumor has also been observed in association with Crohn’s disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, myasthenia gravis, and ankylosing spondylitis all of which strengthen the basis of IOI being an immune-mediated disease. Response to corticosteroid treatment and immunosuppressive agents also support this idea.|$|E
40|$|Kidneys of newborn rats, whose {{mothers were}} given 75 mg/kg of {{gentamicin}} daily from the tenth day of gestation to its term, were examined by light and electron microscopy, as were kidneys of control rats whose mothers were given saline {{during the same}} period. In the gentamicin-treated group, the numbers of differentiated glomeruli and of S-shaped bodies counted in a median cross-section of the kidney were reduced, compared {{with those in the}} control group, but the glomerular volume was the same. In newborn rats issued from gentamicin-treated mothers, the proximal tubular lumen of the mature nephron lying in the deepest cortex was dilated, and their proximal tubular cells exhibited extensive damage, resembling that described in tubular cells of adult rats exposed to gentamicin. The subcapsular nephrogenic zone exhibited focal alterations of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelle</b> membranes, as well as nuclear lesions of several types, in cells of the nephron anlagen of the undifferentiated metanephric blastema, which were otherwise of normal appearance...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} localization of {{the tube}} precipitin (TP) and complement fixation (CF) antigens of Coccidioides immitis was examined by immunoelectron microscopy with murine immunoglobulin G 1 monoclonal antibodies directed against the TP and CF antigens, respectively. Immunoelectron microscopic analyses of saprobic- and parasitic-phase cells showed that the TP antigen is present at a high concentration within the inner cell wall layer and along the plasma membrane. The antigen was also detected, at a lesser concentration, within cytoplasmic vacuoles. In contrast to the predominant localization of the TP antigen in the cell walls, the CF antigen residues primarily within the cytoplasm, where {{it appears to be}} dispersed throughout the cytoplasm rather than associated with a specific <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelle.</b> A sparse amount of the CF antigen within the inner cell walls was also demonstrable.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{incorporation}} of tritiated uridine into RNA by the spermatogenic {{cells of the}} rat has been analyzed by high-resolution autoradiography. Special attention {{has been focused on}} the unique <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>organelle,</b> the chromatoid body. After a short labeling time (2 h), this organelle remains unlabeled {{in the vast majority of}} the early spermatids although the nuclei are labeled. When the 2 -h incubation with (3 H) uridine is followed by a 14 -h chase, the chromatoid body is seen distinctly labeled in all spermatids during early spermiogenesis from step 1 to step 8. Very few grains are seen elsewhere in the cytoplasm of these cells. When RNA synthesis in the spermatid ceases, the chromatoid body also remains unlabeled. It is likely that the chromatoid body contains RNA which is synthesized in the nuclei of the spermatids. The function of this RNA as a stable messenger RNA needed for the regulation of late spermiogenesis is discussed...|$|R
