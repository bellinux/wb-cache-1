50|$|A Chinese form of {{elaborate}} rhymed prose called fu {{developed as}} the major literary form particularly associated with the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE). Generally, the fu type of rhymed prose describes an object, feeling, or other particular subject, using an exhaustive catalog of details and associated vocabulary, and characteristically used both rhyme and prose, variable line lengths, alliteration, onomatopoeia, and some parallelism. Topics of fu rhymed prose could vary from the exalted to the everyday: it was sometimes used to eloquently glorify the emperors; but, other topics of well-known fu included encyclopedic catalogs of minerals, types of pasta, and the species of plants a poet might expect to encounter during an exile due to political disfavor. The style of the National Anthem of the Republic of China follows that of a four-character poem (四言詩), also called a four-character rhymed prose (四言韻文), which first appeared during the Zhou Dynasty. The fu literary form was at first classed with poetry, but later <b>bibliographies</b> <b>classified</b> fu {{at the head of}} prose works.|$|R

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: The {{objective}} was to determine {{a link between the}} number of non-English language references in the bibliographies of publications in international pharmaceutical journals and the geographic origin of these publications. METHODS: A systematic prospective analysis of 7 international pharmaceutical journals in 2005 - 2006. All research articles whom corresponding author was a pharmacist were included. For each article, were recorded: - the geographic origin of the corresponding author (classified in: North America, Latin America, Oceania, Europe, Asia, others); - the title of the journal; - the number of non-English language references in the <b>bibliography</b> (<b>classified</b> in: Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, others). RESULTS: 1, 568 articles were included, corresponding to 45, 949 bibliographic references, of whom 542 where non-English references. North America is the geographic zone of the world with the lowest rate of non-English language references in bibliographies of published articles; significant differences appear between North America and Europe, Latin America and Asia. A sub-analysis by countries shows that United States, United Kingdom, Australia and China present a specific low rate of non-English language references. The two journals with the lowest rate of non-English language references in bibliographies of published articles are edited in the USA. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some limitations, this study shows that pharmacists from regions where English language is the only or predominant language are refractory to include non-English language references in the bibliographies of their publications. The fundamental reasons of this restriction are not clear...|$|R

For the first time, a complete bibliography of English, French and German writings on Chinese religions was assembled into a single research source. The entire field of Chinese religious studies is indebted to Professor Thompson for this extraordinary feat of bibliographic research. At the request of Professor Julian F. Pas, I compiled 2 ̆ 2 Western Language Publications on Chinese Religions, 1981 - 19872 ̆ 2 (in Pas 1989) as a supplement to Chinese Religion in Western Languages. Due to limitations of time and library resources, I could not possibly prepare a research tool anywhere near as comprehensive nor as cogently organized as Professor Thompson 2 ̆ 7 s bibliography. The present bibliography corrects some errors and supplies many entries missing in my previous list, and also brings the coverage forward to 1989. The coverage is also expanded to include Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Nestorianism, and Manichaeism in China. Unfortunately the bibliography is still limited to being a list of articles from a small number of common journals, monographs and collections, including many references (which I could not verify) taken from published bibliographies and footnotes. Although the bibliography is very incomplete, I hope it will be of some use while we await Professor Thompson 2 ̆ 7 s next installment of Chinese Religion in Western Languages...|$|E
40|$|Malcohn de Chazal (1902 - 1981) {{is little}} known abroad and {{misunderstood}} by his compatriots in Mauritius. Man {{of letters and}} theatre, poet and painter, sometime philosopher and prolific columnist, Chazal was an agricultural engineer by training but worked for the telecommunications department. This thesis attempts to synthesise these multiple incarnations by putting together the salient aspects of his literary biography and the extensive detailed of his bibliography in particular : published books, newspaper and journal articles, book reviews, prefaces, unpublished works, correspondence, radio and television programmes. This task was complicated by an author {{who was at the}} same time egocentric and fiercely timid: Yet it fills a sizeable void in this field of study. The response of his critics in books and articles forms {{the second half of the}} bibliography; prefaces, critical books, academic works, -dictionary entries, catalogues and prefaces of exhibitions, and economic tracts. A renewed interest in Chazal in Mauritius and in France has relaunched study of the author, and encouraged publishers to reprint long forgotten works. It is hoped that this thesis will become a powerful research tool with its succinct biography, and in particular because of its complete bibliography. The newspaper and journal articles are classified chronologically by title and by alphabetical order of the newspaper or journal. A thematic classification of Chazal's articles with accompanying notes, as well as purely chronological classifications of all newspaper and journal articles facilitate the work of the researcher. The appendices are further augmented by a list of articles whose details have not been checked; an inventory of published works and articles of Chazal in mauritian archives and libraries (including useful information on these places); a list of authors and. books cited in Chazal's articles; a lexicon of titles, and names of people and places in Mauritius. This is followed by a detailed list of sources used in this thesis. The practical aspects of this study must be emphasised : from its presentation of Chazal's works to that of his critics, from its summary of Chazal studies to its projections of what still needs to be done. The confused reader will have a point of reference, and the initiated researcher will find a more useful guide within these pages than what is currently available. The study reflects this author's own difficulties, and tries to lighten the load of others by resolving a goo 4 number of these issues. The thesis underlines Chazal's literary output by providing an accessible biography and a <b>classified</b> <b>bibliography,</b> while merely sketching his artistic career. The ultimate goal is to render author and work more accessible. While we are made aware of the paucity of research, the road ahead is rich with unexplored topics of study...|$|E

The majority of the material relates to the publication of The Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook, journal of the Leo Baeck Institute. It is the pre-eminent journal on central European Jewish history and culture, featuring the world's most prominent experts in the social, cultural, intellectual and political history of Jews in central Europe after 1789, including the Holocaust. Records in this collection include the Yearbook Binders from 1956 to 2000. These comprise the primary internal record of the editorial work behind each volume, and include extensive correspondence with the authors of the yearbook articles. Other yearbook materials include reviews and administrative documents. The collection also includes a small amount of documentation about the ongoing series of monographs on German-Jewish history, the Schriftenreihe wissenschaftlicher Abhandlungen des Leo Baeck Instituts. Administrative documents reflecting the basic functioning of LBI London include general and LBI-internal correspondence, meeting minutes, and reports. The collection also includes printed materials clipped and saved by LBI London mostly from the 1950 s through the 1970 s, such as reviews of its publications, German-Jewish subject files, and articles about LBI London itself. The collection also contains a small but wide-ranging series of archival materials collected by or donated to LBI London.

Its aim is to put on record the history and culture of German-speaking Jewry throughout central Europe, from Koenigsberg to Alsace, whose contribution to their countries of origin was immense. The LBI consists of independent centers in New York, Jerusalem, and London. The Wissenschaftliche Arbeitsgemeinschaft, the Verein der Freunde und Foerderer in Frankfurt/Main and the branch of the New York archive at the Jewish Museum in Berlin – all in Germany – contribute to the work of the three centers. The London Institute is responsible for The Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook, which has appeared annually since 1956. Its articles cover cultural, economic, political, social and religious history, the impact of antisemitism and the Jewish response to it. Its <b>classified</b> <b>bibliography</b> is recognized as being of unique value for researchers and students. Over the years, the London Institute has also produced many symposium volumes and monographs, as well as more than 70 volumes in the Schriftenreihe wissenschaftlicher Abhandlungen des Leo Baeck Instituts.
