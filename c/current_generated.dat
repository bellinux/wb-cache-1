25|$|By {{lining the}} light {{receiving}} {{surface of the}} cell with nano-sized metallic studs, {{the efficiency of the}} cell can be substantially increased, as the light reflects off these studs at an oblique angle to the cell, increasing the length of the path the light takes through the cell, thereby increasing the number of photons absorbed by the cell, and so also the amount of <b>current</b> <b>generated.</b>|$|E

A bathymetry {{survey conducted by the}} National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) to measure the depth of the sea has revealed the entry channel to the port has deepened enabling the berthing of vessels of deeper drafts. The high <b>current</b> <b>generated</b> by the tsunami waves dredged about 0.4 to 0.5 million cubic metres of sediments, which has deepened the 17.4m-deep harbour by 1 to 2m more, especially along the Dr. Ambedkar Dock and the Barathi Dock.

25|$|Although the dye {{is highly}} {{efficient}} at converting absorbed photons into free electrons in the TiO2, only photons {{absorbed by the}} dye ultimately produce current. The rate of photon absorption depends upon the absorption spectrum of the sensitized TiO2 layer and upon the solar flux spectrum. The overlap between these two spectra determines the maximum possible photocurrent. Typically used dye molecules generally have poorer absorption in the red part of the spectrum compared to silicon, which means that fewer of the photons in sunlight are usable for current generation. These factors limit the <b>current</b> <b>generated</b> by a DSSC, for comparison, a traditional silicon-based solar cell offers about 35 mA/cm2, whereas current DSSCs offer about 20 mA/cm2.|$|E

25|$|Henneman {{proposed}} that the mechanism underlying the Size Principle was that the smaller motor neurons had a smaller surface area and therefore a higher membrane resistance. He predicted that the <b>current</b> <b>generated</b> by an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSPs) {{would result in a}} higher voltage change (depolarization) across the neuronal membrane of the smaller motor neurons and therefore larger EPSPs in smaller motoneurons. Burke later demonstrated that there was a graded decrease of both EPSP and inhibitory post synaptic potential (IPSP) amplitudes from small to large motoneurons. This seemed to confirm Henneman's idea, but Burke disagreed, pointing out that larger neurons with a larger surface area had space for more synapses. Burke eventually showed (in a very small sample of neurons) that smaller motoneurons have a greater number of synaptic inputs from a single input source. The topic is probably still regarded as controversial.|$|E

500|$|Back in the tunnels, Doggett {{notices a}} green glow on Bianco in {{a dimly lit}} former subway station. As such, he refuses to allow the {{lieutenant}} to leave. Bianco runs away, forcing Doggett to give chase. He learns from Scully that Karras has gone ahead of plan and allowed the passengers onto the platforms and the subway will start back up, despite the danger. After analyzing various water samples found at the scene, Scully meets with Dr. Kai Bowe, a marine biologist, who explains that the sample contains a unique microscopic sea creature called a medusa which are made out of calcium and are bioluminescent. However, Bowe does not know why the electrical reaction happens. When Doggett finds the wounded Bianco, he finds that his condition has gotten worse. Doggett then carries Bianco {{on his back and}} helps him continue through the tunnels. They soon encounter a boy with no signs of the luminous green substance on him. Scully realizes that sweat is causing the chemical electrical reaction since it is conductive to calcium ions. The boy does not have well developed sweat glands yet so the medusas are not affecting him. Doggett follows the boy to a major leak from the bay with the green glow on all the walls. Suddenly, an oncoming subway approaches the group—Karras has allowed the subway to resume schedule. Doggett uses Bianco’s gun as a electrical conductor between the third rail and the water, hence the electric <b>current</b> <b>generated</b> from friction between the subway wheels and the rail passes through Bianco’s gun into the water, killing [...] the medusas and preventing further exposure.|$|E

30|$|The LIF {{models have}} been {{extensively}} applied to model the membrane potential evolution in single neurons in computational neuroscience (for reviews, see [20, 21]). The model has some biophysical realism while still maintaining mathematical simplicity. The simplest LIF model is an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process with constant conductance, leak potential, and diffusion coefficient. More biophysical realism {{can be obtained by}} allowing for post-spike <b>currents</b> <b>generated</b> by past spikes [22]. Here we use post-spike <b>currents</b> <b>generated</b> via three types of kernels [23, 24]: bursting, decaying, and delaying kernel, all modeled by the difference between two decaying exponentials, but any kernel could be used.|$|R

He used a combination of sheet iron, copper and porcelain plates, and a solution of sulphate of copper and dilute acid. In a letter to the same publication written in December 1838 but published in June 1839, German physicist Christian Friedrich Schönbein discussed the first crude fuel cell that he had invented.

2500|$|Most glucometers today use an {{electrochemical}} method. Test strips {{contain a}} capillary that sucks up a reproducible amount of blood. The glucose {{in the blood}} reacts with an enzyme electrode containing glucose oxidase (or dehydrogenase). The enzyme is reoxidized with an excess of a mediator reagent, such as a ferricyanide ion, a ferrocene derivative or osmium bipyridyl complex. The mediator in turn is reoxidized by reaction at the electrode, which generates an electric current. [...] The total charge passing through the electrode {{is proportional to the}} amount of glucose in the blood that has reacted with the enzyme. The coulometric method is a technique where the total amount of charge generated by the glucose oxidation reaction is measured over a period of time. The amperometric method is used by some meters and measures the electric <b>current</b> <b>generated</b> at a specific point in time by the glucose reaction. This is analogous to throwing a ball and using the speed at which it is travelling at a point in time to estimate how hard it was thrown. The coulometric method can allow for variable test times, whereas the test time on [...] a meter using the amperometric method is always fixed. Both methods give an estimation of the concentration of glucose in the initial blood sample.|$|E

This {{view of the}} {{secondary}} character of the sulphuric acid as an agent {{in the production of}} the voltaic current, is further confirmed by the fact, that the <b>current</b> <b>generated</b> and transmitted is directly and exactly proportional to the quantity of water decomposed and the quantity of zinc oxidized (868. 991.), and is the same as that required to decompose the same quantity of water. As, therefore, the decomposition of the water shows that the electricity has passed by its means, there remains no other electricity to be accounted for or to be referred to any action other than that of the zinc and the water on each other.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{recently}} cloned retinal cone Na+-Ca 2 +-K+ exchanger (NCKX) {{was expressed}} in cultured insect cells, and whole-cell patch clamp {{was used to}} measure transmembrane <b>currents</b> <b>generated</b> by this transcript and compare them with <b>currents</b> <b>generated</b> by retinal rod NCKX or by a deletion mutant rod NCKX from which the two large hydrophilic loops were removed. We have characterized the ionic <b>currents</b> <b>generated</b> by both the forward (Ca 2 + extrusion) and reverse (Ca 2 + influx) modes of all three NCKX proteins. Reverse NCKX exchange <b>generated</b> outward <b>current</b> that required the simultaneous presence of both external Ca 2 + and external K+. Forward NCKX exchange carried inward current with Na+, but not with Li+ in the bath solution. The cation dependencies of the three NCKX tested (external K+, external Na+, internal Ca 2 +) were very similar {{to each other and to}} those reported previously for the in situ rod NCKX. These findings provide the first electrophysiological characterization of cone NCKX and the first electrophysiological characterization of potassium-dependent Na+-Ca+ exchangers in heterologous systems. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of combining heterologous expression and biophysical measurements for detailed NCKX structure/function studies...|$|R
