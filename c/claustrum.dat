5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{is connected}} by the brainstem to the spinal cord. The brainstem {{consists of the}} midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The cerebellum {{is connected to the}} brainstem by pairs of tracts. Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system, consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the thalamus, the epithalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the limbic structures, including the amygdala and the hippocampus; the <b>claustrum,</b> the various nuclei of the basal ganglia; the basal forebrain structures, and the three circumventricular organs. The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells. There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain, and a more or less equal number of other cells. Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses. Neurons form elaborate neural networks of neural pathways and circuits. The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E

50|$|Very {{little is}} known about the actual {{function}} of the <b>claustrum.</b> Anatomical hindrances combined with a lack of case studies have left many holes in the research on the <b>claustrum.</b> For these reasons, systematic studies of the <b>claustrum</b> have been sparse.|$|E
5000|$|There {{have also}} {{been a number of}} {{interesting}} studies looking at the proteins inside the <b>claustrum.</b> In one experiment performed at the University of South Carolina by J.R. Augustine et al., researchers looked at calcium-binding proteins in the rhesus monkey <b>claustrum,</b> including calbindin D28K, parvalbumin, and calretinin. After removing the brains and properly preserving them, the group used various antibodies and antiserums to detect the presence of the proteins. The calbindin proteins were shown as likely elements in the inhibitory circuitry of the <b>claustrum,</b> while the calretinin most likely served as calcium buffer to maintain homeostasis. Another study looked at the serotonergic innervation in the <b>claustrum.</b> [...] The clear conclusion here was that, in the ventral <b>claustrum</b> where the visual projections are, the stained axons were short and arranged randomly. However, in the dorsal, non-visual section, of the <b>claustrum,</b> the fibers ran consistently in long lengths along the dorsal-ventral direction. Like many of the other studies, this is a good first step toward determining the true functions of the <b>claustrum,</b> although there is still much room for work.|$|E
50|$|As far as {{historical}} cases shedding {{light on the}} anatomy and function of the <b>claustrum</b> is concerned, there have not been many to date that survived the struggle of time. There was one documented case on an enlarged <b>claustrum</b> in a patient with epilepsy, as well as another {{case in which the}} insula was malformed but the <b>claustrum</b> remained. These cases have not lent very much toward the pursuit of truth regarding the <b>claustrum.</b> At this point in time, pathology involved with the <b>claustrum</b> remains unknown. Also, due to the location and complex integration of the <b>claustrum</b> with other parts of the brain, it is difficult to do lesion studies without affecting other regions. Likewise, ablation is not an effective option, either. Most studies involve either the removal and preservation of the brain or in vivo scanning of the area of interest during different studies. This could involve fMRI, the newer Tractography technology, or others.|$|E
5000|$|One big {{point of}} {{discussion}} {{with regard to}} the <b>claustrum</b> has been on the ontogeny. One side, which Dr. Edelstein deems the pallial group, believes the <b>claustrum</b> is a derivative of the insular cortex. While some designated this as a certain distinguished area {{not to be confused with}} the rest of the cortex, they still ascertained that the ontogeny was based on the development of the cortex. The other side states that the <b>claustrum</b> is derived from basal ganglia. Ramon y Cajal supported this latter theory, as did many other researchers. [...] Based on more recent methods of looking at the development of both the human and animal mind, including fMRI among others, there has been increasing evidence against the <b>claustrum</b> being a part of the cortex. They seem to have distinct developmental periods and are, therefore, deemed separate structures. The third theory, which is supported by the majority at present, says that the <b>claustrum</b> is neither distinctly part of the cortex nor from the basal ganglia complex. Based on a number of studies, including those that show projections on both sides of the <b>claustrum,</b> many believe the <b>claustrum</b> should be considered a seventh layer of the cortex, in the insular region. [...] This hypothesis, which is growing support, including the aforementioned Dr. Larry Edelstein, is labeled as Filiminoff's hypothesis since he was estimated to be the first to come to this conclusion. A fourth theory, known as the [...] "claustroamygdalar DVR hypothesis" [...] suggests that the reptilian dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR) is homologous to the <b>claustrum</b> and basolateral amygdala, suggesting a closer relationship of the <b>claustrum</b> to the amygdala rather than insular cortex or basal ganglia.|$|E
50|$|Further {{evidence}} for a role of the <b>claustrum</b> in supporting consciousness comes from a recent resting state fMRI study in awake versus anesthetized rodents. This study revealed strong interhemispheric functional connectivity from the <b>claustrum</b> with medial prefrontal cortex and mediodorsal thalamus in the awake state that are lost in the anesthetized state. This is the first study to identify the specific neural substrates by which the <b>claustrum</b> might promote consciousness.|$|E
50|$|The <b>claustrum</b> has a {{uniformity}} in its {{types of}} cells, indicating a uniform type of processing by all claustral neurons. Though organized into modality specific regions, the <b>claustrum</b> contains {{a great deal}} of longitudinal connections between its neurons that could serve to synchronize the entire anterior-posterior extent of the <b>claustrum.</b> Francis Crick and Christof Koch have compared the <b>claustrum</b> to the conductor of an orchestra, referring to its regulatory role in consciousness and cognition. The different parts of the cortex must play in harmony or else the result is a cacophony of sounds instead of a beautiful symphony. The <b>claustrum</b> may be involved in widespread coordination of the cerebral cortex, using synchronization to achieve a seamless timescale between both the two cortical hemispheres and between cortical regions within the same hemisphere, resulting in the seamless quality of conscious experience.|$|E

There are lateral and medial tracts connecting the <b>claustrum</b> to many parts of the cortex and perhaps to the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the caudate nucleus (connections with subcortical centers are a matter of debate).|$|E

5000|$|Clinical {{evidence}} {{has suggested that}} the <b>claustrum</b> {{plays an important role in}} maintaining consciousness, potentially being usable as an [...] "on-off switch". In 2014, a case was reported of one woman who became unresponsive when her <b>claustrum</b> was electrically stimulated, regaining responsiveness as soon as the stimulation stopped. The woman had no memory of the period during which she was unresponsive.|$|E
50|$|Despite this {{hypothesis}} by Crick and Koch, a November 2010 study in primates reported that <b>claustrum</b> {{does not seem}} to be integrating information from multiple sensory modalities, but instead contains separated unimodal processing regions. Furthermore, neuroanatomical tracing studies in rodents have shown the <b>claustrum</b> though not involved in sensorimotor integration, is involved in sensorimotor coordination that is driven by dense inputs from the motor cortex.|$|E
5000|$|One {{interesting}} aspect {{about the}} <b>claustrum</b> is {{the paucity of}} cell types. In {{most parts of the}} brain, especially in the cortical regions, there is considerable differentiation of cell types, giving way to a number of functions. In the <b>claustrum,</b> as Dr. Crick and others pointed out, there are three main types of cells. [...] The first, which is deemed Type 1, is large and covered with dendritic spines. These cells receive input as well as project back toward various regions, both laterally and medially. The other two types of cells do not have spines, but can be told apart based on the cell body size. However, both are restricted to the <b>claustrum</b> and, thus, are labeled interneurons.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>claustrum</b> is {{the region}} of the brain in which the KOR is most densely expressed. It has been {{proposed}} that this area, based on its structure and connectivity, has [...] "a role in coordinating a set of diverse brain functions", and the <b>claustrum</b> has been elucidated as playing a crucial role in consciousness. As examples, lesions of the <b>claustrum</b> in humans are associated with disruption of consciousness and cognition, and electrical stimulation of the area between the insula and the <b>claustrum</b> has been found to produce an immediate loss of consciousness in humans along with recovery of consciousness upon cessation of the stimulation. On the basis of the preceding knowledge, it has been proposed that inhibition of the <b>claustrum</b> (as well as, [...] "additionally, the deep layers of the cortex, mainly in prefrontal areas") by activation of KORs in these areas is primarily responsible for the profound consciousness-altering/dissociative hallucinogen effects of salvinorin A and other KOR agonists. In addition, it has been stated that [...] "the subjective effects of S. divinorum indicate that salvia disrupts certain facets of consciousness much more than the largely serotonergic hallucinogen LSD", and it has been postulated that inhibition of a brain area that is apparently as fundamentally involved in consciousness and higher cognitive function as the <b>claustrum</b> may explain this. However, these conclusions are merely tentative, as [...] "KORs are not exclusive to the claustrum; there is also a fairly high density of receptors located in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and putamen", and [...] "disruptions to other brain regions could also explain the consciousness-altering effects salvinorin A".|$|E

Given that <b>claustrum</b> activation is thought to reflect the integration of perceptual and memory elements into a conscious gestalt, they suggest that activation correlates with the experience of fluency.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is clear}} that the <b>claustrum</b> {{projects}} to, and receives projections from, a number of cortices, including the primary motor, premotor, prefrontal, auditory, and visual, among others. In one study conducted in France by Judith Tanne-Gariepy et al. (9), these projections were traced back to segregated areas, including differentiated areas along the dorsoventral axis for the pre-supplementary motor area and supplementary motor area proper. Projections from the <b>claustrum</b> to various sub-regions of the motor cortex were shown to overlap somewhat, but did show a degree of local segregation. [...] The truly interesting thing about the <b>claustrum,</b> however, is how it can take in multiple information modalities, including motor, visual, and auditory. It has even been shown that the same cells can process information across all these types, even though there is some semblance of segregation across a single type of information.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the exact}} {{function}} of the <b>claustrum</b> remains to be verified, connectivity {{studies have shown that}} the <b>claustrum</b> plays a strong role in communication between the two hemispheres of the brain, specifically between cortical regions controlling attention. The precise role of these interhemispheric circuits is not yet understood, but one goal could be to create a common timescale between the two hemispheres, which might help to achieve a seamless unity of attention/consciousness between processing in each hemisphere. Other interhemispheric connections could also play a role in this process.|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} studies, summed up succinctly by Crick and Koch, {{have suggested that the}} <b>claustrum</b> is essential in multisensory integration. Objects in real life have many different characteristics, such as sound, shape, color, speed, and smell.

We need to take in all of this information and integrate it correctly to perceive a single object. [...] "Binding" [...] of various sensory modalities is essential to merge all the information of a single stimulus into a single percept.
