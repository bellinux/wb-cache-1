The neck had well-developed areas for muscle and ligament attachment, probably to support the heavy skull and beak. On each side, it had six ribs, four of which articulated with the sternum through sternal ribs. The sternum was large, but small {{in relation to the}} body <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> of much smaller pigeons that are able to fly.

The carpometacarpus of the dodo was more robust than that of the solitaire, however. The pelvis was wider than that of the solitaire and other relatives, yet was comparable to the proportions in some smaller, flighted pigeons. Most of the leg bones were more robust than those of extant pigeons and the solitaire, but the length proportions were little different.|$|E

5|$|Imagery {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of the Orb's persona. This is most prominent during live performances, where they often project surreal images against onstage screens. Common images include morphing faces, futuristic cityscapes, and aliens. They have long associated their act with absurd symbology with images such as floating pigs. This has carried over to their music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins. Because of their use of psychedelic images at shows, the Orb's shows are frequently <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> of Pink Floyd, who also used in-show imagery and films. Paterson cites Godfrey Reggio's and Philip Glass's film Koyaanisqatsi as a primary influence to their concert imagery.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior.

The researchers found lesions like those caused by stress fractures on a dromaeosaurid hand claw, one of only two such claw lesions discovered in the course of the study. Stress fractures in the hands have special behavioral significance <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> found in the feet, since stress fractures there can be obtained while running or during migration.
