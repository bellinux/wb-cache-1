40|$|New {{polymeric}} materials containing functional sites analogous to ionic liquids have been synthesized. Those materials are a supported reservoir for the active Pd species. Their catalytic activity has been evaluated for the Heck reaction proving an excellent performance {{in terms of}} both activity and recyclability. Although soluble Pd species seem to participate in the catalytic cycle, as for many other supported Pd-systems, the g-SILLPs present the ability to efficiently release and recapture those soluble species. This allows to dramatically reduce or eliminate the amount of Pd leached to the final solution, in particular at higher temperatures, and opens the way, based on a release and catch strategy, for the development of active-supported Pd catalytic systems, easily recoverable and reusable for a large number of catalytic cycles. The exact nature of the polymer (SILLPs) has a remarkable influence on the overall process. The appropriate design of the g-SILLPs is a key factor for the optimization of the release and <b>catch</b> <b>system.</b> The functionalized polymers prepared can be reused for a significant number of catalytic cycles without any loss in performance. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Second, it is cleared that there is group which has been continuously making the Over-Fishing and the number of these groups are increasing year after year. The cause of continuous the Over-Fishing is fisherman tend to catch not only quantity of quota but also catches that they can pay a penalty. Third, it is possible to catch before securing enough quota in New Zealand's ITQs system. Because of this precedent of fishing, Quota Leased have been utlilized as an adjustment for the excess of catches...|$|E

Methods for mitigating the debris threat caused by the breakup of a reinforced concrete bay that housed the fuel tank were also investigated. The Otto fuel was assumed to have a TNT equivalency of 1. 0. Several mitigation techniques were investigated during a one-fifth scale test series including: sand fill around the Otto fuel tank and concrete bay, a steel plate <b>catch</b> <b>system</b> for fragments and debris, a high strength fiber wrap {{on the walls of}} the bay, and blasting mats around the bay. All the concepts included some amount of sand fill around the tank. Substantial reductions in blast overpressure hazards were measured in all cases, but concrete debris throw distances were not reduced to acceptable distances. A case where the fuel tank was located in a large sand berm outside the bay was modeled in a subsequent one-third scale test series and acceptable reductions in both blast overpressure and fragment hazards were measured.

40|$|Personnel injury {{from flying}} glass {{produced}} during an explosion accident can represent a significant hazard, often {{in excess of}} hazards due to airblast, primary fragments, building collapse, and secondary fragments. The permissible overpressure in Inhabited Building Distance (IBD) from a Potential Explosion Site (PES) is 1. 2 psi. This pressure is sufficient to cause failure of most windows in conventional construction. Failure of these windows can produce hazardous glass shards which can cause serious injury. A research program was initiated {{to address this issue}} and develop cost effective methods for mitigating the hazards. The program was designed to address blast loads with a peak pressure up to 7 psi. Anchored widow film systems were designed and tested for low pressure applications.

40|$|AbstractBackground: One of the {{key issues}} in the {{investigation}} of evolution is how complex systems evolved from simple chemical replicators. Theoretical work proposed several models in which complex replicating systems are kinetically stabilized. The development of powerful isothermal amplification technique allows complex nucleic acid based evolving in vitro systems to be set up, which may then serve to verify experimentally current theories of evolution. Recently such a system based on the 3 SR (self-sustained sequence replication) reaction has been established to investigate the evolution of cooperation: the trans-cooperatively coupled CATCH (cooperative amplification by cross hybridization). Results: Over four rounds of serial transfer, the cooperatively coupled two species <b>CATCH</b> <b>system</b> evolved into a more complex cooperative four species system, which then was overgrown by CATCH-derived RNA-Z-like hairpin species. In contrast to the classical RNA-Z species, these molecules have complementary loop sequences and self-amplify using a dual mechanism that includes concentration-dependent phases of noncooperative and cooperative amplification. Conclusions: The evolution of a cooperative system, under conditions that were alternately unfavorable and favorable for cooperative amplification, led to a system showing facultative cooperation. This principle of facultative cooperation preserves the complexity of the system investigated and could have general implications for the evolution and stabilization of cooperation under oscillating reaction conditions...|$|E

Many {{fishermen}} diversify {{their income}} by fishing {{in more than}} one fishery which can significantly reduce year-to-year variation in income. However, opportunities to diversify have become more limited as access to fisheries has become more restricted. The implementation of <b>catch</b> share <b>systems</b> could further reduce diversification if those who remain in a fishery consolidate catch privileges and specialize, and those who exit lose a component of their fishing portfolio. However, catch shares, particularly in the form of IFQs, offer individuals who had not been part of fishery the opportunity to enter by purchasing or leasing quota. Thus the net effect of catch shares on diversification is uncertain. Furthermore, for fishermen that remain in the catch share fishery, the secure privilege to harvest a set share of the TAC may provide opportunities to reduce variation in income offsetting increased risk associated with reduced diversification. Thus it remains an empirical question whether and how catch shares affect diversification and variation in income. We present an empirical study of diversification in 14 catch share fisheries with a diversity of species from different regions of the US, including both IFQs and cooperative-based <b>catch</b> share <b>systems.</b> For each of these fisheries we test whether diversification levels and trends in diversification changed after implementation of IFQs both for fishermen that remained in the <b>catch</b> share <b>system</b> and for those that exited but remained active in other fisheries.

40|$|This {{paper has}} {{continued}} from the Development of Squid Fishery and its Processsing in Nagasaki Prefecture before the World War Ⅱ {{on the previous}} issue of this bulletin. Contrary to the fishery in pre-World War Ⅱ, squid angling fishery has developed in the forms of boat-motorization, expansion of fishing grounds, introduction of electric light and automatic angling machines. The products of dried squid were shifted from exporting to China to supplying domestic consumption which was later also in fresh. Squid angling fishery in Nagasaki Prefecture is characterized as a low productivity due to the abundance of its small boats {{compared with that of}} the whole country, eliminating its position in terms of total squid capture which was challenged by the development of other fisheries. In addition, new processing methods besides dried squid did not appear in this prefecture. During a decade after the war, squid angling fishery and dried squid making was soon resumed with its former technology. Since the late of the 1950 's, boat-motorization has been gradually improved in both quantity and quality of gear effectiveness, which led to the wining support from the government, and the new marketing channel of Nagasaki Fisheries Cooperative Federation has well developed since then. In the 1970 's, with an increase of price and fresh fish demand, squid angling boats became much bigger embedded with automatic angling machines, and expanded their fishing grounds in the whole Japan Sea. The products were landed in fresh at ports nearby the fising ground. This industrial way, otherwise, has resulted in the loss of job such as sun-drying and its marketing within the fishing village. Since the 1980 's, offshore squid angling fishery has been in a setback situation due to shortage of labour, oil crisis, and 200 miles restriction. The number of squid boats has declined especially middle and large boats in Nagasaki Prefecture, which are now no longer existed. The recent economic recession has compelled the small boats of less than 20 tons to reduce their activities, while squid angling fishery has been reorganized toward the total allowable <b>catch</b> <b>system,</b> regulation of lightening, and coastal operation...|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wall damage after 4 wall-contact devices (the Merci retriever, <b>Catch</b> thromboembolectomy <b>system,</b> and Solitaire FR revascularization devices of 4 and 6 mm) and 1 aspiration device (the Penumbra System) was evaluated in the superficial femoral arteries of 20 male swine. Each device was tested {{with and without}} intraluminal clot. Twenty control vessels were not subjected to any intervention. Acute histopathologic changes were evaluated. RESULTS: In the device samples, endothelial denudation (72. 8 29. 4 % versus 0. 9 1. 9 %, P. 0001), medial layer edema (52 35. 9 % versus 18. 1 27. 8 %, P. 004), and mural thrombus (5. 3 14. 2 % versus 0 %, P. 05) were found {{to a greater extent}} compared with the control samples.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare {{efficacy}} and potential complications of 2 commercially available devices for mechanical thromboembolectomy. METHODS: Devices were tested in an established animal model allowing the use of routine angiography catheters and thrombectomy devices. Radio-opaque thrombi were used for visualization of thrombus-device interaction during angiography. The Merci Retrieval <b>System</b> and the <b>Catch</b> Thromboembolectomy <b>System</b> were assessed each in 10 vessel occlusions. For every occluded vessel up to 5 retrieval attempts were performed. RESULTS: Sufficient recanalization was achieved with the Merci Retriever in 90 % of occlusions, and with the Catch device recanalization was achieved in 70 % of occlusions. Recanalization at the first attempt occurred significantly more often with the Merci Retriever compared to the Catch device (OR, 21; 95 % CI, 1. 78 - 248. 11). Consequently, significantly more attempts (P= 0. 02) had to be performed with the Catch device; therefore, time to recanalization was longer. Thrombus fragmentations during retrieval were caused more often by the Catch device compared to the Merci Retriever (OR, 15. 6; 95 % CI, 1. 73 - 140. 84), resulting in a higher distal embolization rate. During retrieval both devices lost thrombotic material at the tip of the guide catheter, which was then aspirated in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: Both distal devices are effective for thromboembolectomy. To avoid loss of thrombotic material and distal embolization, the use of large luminal balloon guide catheters and aspiration during retrieval seems to be mandatory. The design of the Merci Retriever appears to be more efficient during thrombus mobilization and retrieval with less fragmentation compared to the <b>Catch</b> Thromboembolectomy <b>System...</b>|$|R
