5000|$|After leaving Drummer, Fritscher {{published}} a raunchy zine, Man2Man. It lasted for 8 quarterly issues (1980-81, according to copyright dates), preceded by an introductory/marketing issue. Under the slogans [...] "What You're Looking For Is Looking for You" [...] and [...] "The Mag You Can Stick Your Nose In," [...] {{it consisted of}} 44-60 pages, primarily created on a typewriter. Each issue had totally uncensored and sometimes weird personal ads, readers' letters, pictures from Old Reliable, Rex, and others, interviews, pornographic fiction by Fritscher, ads by purveyors of erotic merchandise, and articles on such topics as [...] "Clothes Harvesting" [...] (stealing athletes' <b>clothes</b> from <b>locker</b> rooms), jockstraps, cigars, and other fetishes which by today's standards are extreme. Mark Hemry is identified as publisher and credited with graphic design. The entire run is available online, with sexual organs blacked out.|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies has}} {{identified}} {{the locker room}} experience as a potential deterrent for participation in physical education. Both psychological and physical issues arise due to several factors. Psychological issues include different kinds of verbal and physical violations, comparisons between pupils, feeling of vulnerability along with a stressful schedule. The physical environment can contribute to negative experience for pupils in terms of filthy premises and cold showers. These factors may contribute to higher absentee rates in physical education. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the pupils’ experiences of the physical and psychological environment of locker rooms and its effect on the pupils. The target group of the study was ninth grade pupils from different schools in Umeå. The pupils were requested to fill out a survey. It was answered by a total of 102 pupils from four different schools and six different classes. The data was analysed in the statistical software SPSS and comparisons was made on sex and membership in a sports club. The result showed that a majority of the pupils perceived the toilets, shower room and the overall condition of the locker room as filthy. This made them less likely to participate in physical education or change <b>clothes</b> in the <b>locker</b> room. Many pupils felt intimidated and insecure while changing clothes and while showering. Members of sport clubs felt more secure than pupils who were not members and boys felt more secure than girls. The occurrence of violations in the locker room was low and the main type of perceived abuse was in the form of mean looks. These types of violations were more common in the girls’ locker room...|$|R
