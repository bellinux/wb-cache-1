25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

[...] He also trumpeted his own moral purity, claiming he [...] "never smoked, chewed, drank, gamblednot even bet on an election." [...] He promised, however, to protect horse racing in the Commonwealth. In response, Sampson's opponents dubbed him [...] "Flem-Flam Flem".|$|E

500|$|In Aesthetic Realism {{classes and}} lessons, Koppelman learned that ethical {{problems}} are also artistic problems. [...] He felt his work {{suffered from a}} fight between rigidity and flexibility. He learned he could go after precision in the studio as penance for being careless at other times, wanting {{to get away from}} things. [...] As freedom and order, truth and imagination became more integrated in his life, his art became more imaginative. “I had always had a classical bent in my work,” he wrote. “But there was also a wildness in me that had not <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> work sufficiently or gracefully.” As a result of his study, Koppelman noted, “Tightness and abandon, the classical and the wild, even the conservative and the rebel seemed to be working better together” resulting in art that was “more imaginative, freer in concept” [...] Boldness of imagination and an unerring sense of detail were two qualities Koppelman’s work became noted for.|$|E

[...] He noted, [...] "I don't really want to play professional football, because there is no privacy and no time to be alone when you're a famous athlete." [...] He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: [...] "I see no reason why I can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it." [...] Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. [...] He recalled that those 20 minutes were [...] "horrible." [...] "You want to go home. [...] You want to quit football. [...] It is times like these when something happens to me. [...] I can't explain it. [...] I put my face in my hands and ask God to <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> heart and give me courage. He gives me peace." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{version of}} [...] "Hello Sunshine" [...] is 3 minutes 35 seconds long {{and is in}} the key of D major. The track begins with 43 seconds of the track [...] "By the Sea" [...] from Wendy & Bonnie's 1969 album Genesis {{featuring}} sparse fingerstyle guitar and female harmony vocals. The last syllable of the line [...] "...so hard to say goodbye" [...] is held and pans from left to right until [...] "Hello Sunshine" [...] itself begins with Gruff Rhys singing the title phrase, joined by the band on the second word. The first verse follows with simple piano and bass guitar backing Rhys's acoustic guitar to a basic 4/4 beat provided by drummer Dafydd Ieuan. The first chorus enters at 1 minute 13 seconds with Rhys being joined by falsetto harmony backing vocals on the lines [...] "In honesty it's been a while, since we had reason left to smile". The song breaks down for the bridge with just arpeggio guitar, simple bass and occasional drum rolls playing as the lines [...] "Hello sunshine, <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> life" [...] are sung.|$|E

It's {{important}} to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny." [...] Love explained to Rap-Up magazine his view of the song, [...] "It's just such an aggressive record, it's a club record, it's a worldwide international record. She's stretching her legs out and she's showing her true vocal ability, she's like the queen of the night on this record." [...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] and she feels a great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. I thought maybe that was something I could try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun. [...] "I just thought it'd be so much fun to be a commander of course. It's just a statement for me definitely, coming out on my own, filling my space. I'm happy being a commander".|$|E

2500|$|Pearson {{signed the}} Canada–United States Automotive Agreement (or Auto Pact) in January 1965, and {{unemployment}} fell {{to its lowest}} rate in over a decade. While in office, Pearson declined U.S. requests to send Canadian combat troops into the Vietnam War. Pearson spoke at Temple University in Philadelphia on 2 April 1965, while visiting the United States and voiced his support for a pause in the American bombing of North Vietnam, so that a diplomatic solution to the crisis may unfold. To President Lyndon B. Johnson, this criticism of American foreign policy on American soil was an intolerable sin. Before Pearson had finished his speech, he was summoned to Camp David, Maryland, to meet with Johnson the next day. Johnson, who was notorious for his personal touch in politics, reportedly grabbed Pearson by the lapels and shouted, [...] "Don't you <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> living room and piss on my rug." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{literary}} efforts originated {{after the}} experience, according to her, of a life-defining moment on 29 December 2000. She, her son Benjamin, daughter Jemima {{and her two}} sons, plus her niece Lady Cosima Somerset and her two children were travelling to Kenya, when a passenger on their British Airways plane stormed into the cockpit and tried to seize the controls. The autopilot on the flight to Nairobi became temporarily disengaged and the jumbo was knocked off course, abruptly diving and plunging [...] below. [...] "Nobody on that plane thought, 'am I going to die?'" [...] she later recalled. [...] "They all thought, 'we are going to die'. It was horrible, horrible."

2500|$|Debussy {{had long}} been fascinated by the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, {{familiar}} to French readers through the translations by Charles Baudelaire. As early as 1890, André Suarès {{wrote in a letter}} to Romain Rolland that [...] "Monsieur Claude Debussy... is working on a symphony that will unfold psychological ideas based on the stories of Poe, in particular, The Fall of the House of Usher." [...] Nothing came of this plan but in the wake of the success of his only completed opera, Pelléas et Mélisande in 1902, Debussy turned to Poe for material for a potential successor. He worked on his first attempt at a Poe-inspired opera, the comedy Le diable dans le beffroi, for several years before finally abandoning it in 1911 or 1912. By mid-June 1908 Debussy had begun another opera based on a Poe tale, the darker Fall of the House of Usher. On 5 July he signed a contract with the New York Metropolitan Opera guaranteeing the house the right to stage the premiere of his projected Poe double-bill as well as another unwritten opera La légende de Tristan. That summer he wrote to his friend Jacques Durand: [...] "These days I have been working hard on The Fall of the House of Usher...There are moments when I lose the feeling of things around me and if the sister of Roderick Usher were to <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> house, I shouldn't be very surprised." ...|$|E
