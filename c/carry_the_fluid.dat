40|$|Expressions are {{obtained}} for the rates of change of the vorticity components about the tangent, principal normal, and binormal of inviscid flow of arbitrary configuration with curvature and torsion of the particle paths, and non-uniform density. If a steady flow pattern exists the vorticity changes are exactly those required to <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>fluid</b> particles through it. A small rotational displacement of a fluid element about each of these directions is then considered separately and if the additional rate of change of vorticity has the same sign and order of magnitude as the displacement the motion is unstable locally regardless of the motion elsewhere. The equations depend on four quantities: the curvature, torsion, velocity and vorticity {{at the point where}} stability is being investigated. These four quantities define a helical vortex, with the same stability properties, in which the flow is equivalent. There is there-fore special merit in studying this case. It is found that a vortex with helical particle paths is unstable for rotation of the fluid elements about directions which lie between the vorticity vector and the direction of the axis of the motion, when the density is uniform. More generally, the motion is unstabl...|$|E
30|$|Considering {{our results}} in {{addition}} to literature, we can confidently conclude {{that the rate of}} clinical peritonitis following spillage from laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy in dermoid cysts is 0.2 %. In our series, the spillage rate was 53.8 % per patient with no single case of evident clinical chemical peritonitis after the procedure. However, spillage during laparotomy has been recently reported [11, 13). We believe that the laparoscopic approach allows better rinsing and cleaning and absolute pelvic clean out than does laparotomy. The practice of pneumoperitoneum and bowel retraction allows better exposure of the pouch of Douglas and collection of spilled material in the confined space of cul-de-sac. Additionally, irrigation cannulae with jet-wash lavage is an effective cleaning method that may not be available during laparotomy. We believe that lavage during laparotomy will definitely <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>fluid</b> to the upper abdomen and probably to the subphrenic recesses. It is quite difficult at laparotomy to aspirate back again all irrigation fluid. During laparoscopy, it is possible to aspirate the cyst after placing it intact within the endobag. Although it seems satisfactory to contain all spilled material in the endobag, even in cases of pelvic spill, there is no risk of chemical peritonitis as long as the rule for jet-irrigation aspiration is followed.|$|E

The carrier is a monolith body, {{as far as}} the hollow micro-structures. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The carrier is of a thermoplastic material, as a plate (1) with a bonding layer in a composition in a solvent which matches the carrier material. The layer thickness is less than the width and depth dimensions of the hollow micro-structures. The hollow micro-structures are formed by hot embossing under vacuum, in at least one carrier (1). They can also be channels, with sections leading out of the carrier. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the production of a carrier to transport very small fluid volumes where a bonding layer is applied in a dissolved condition between carrier plates (1), in a layer thickness which is less than the width and depth dimensions of the hollow micro-structures.

40|$|Particle {{methods were}} first {{developed}} {{to handle the}} advection term in the equations of motion of fluids. They can do this easily because the particle trajectories are {{the characteristics of the}} hyperbolic part of the equations (the derivative following the motion), and the particles <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>fluid</b> properties as they move. The equations of motion have other terms involving the spatial derivatives and these were originally calculated using a grid as in the Particle in Cell method (PIC) due to Harlow. A related method due to Eastwood is the EPICmethod where virtual particles are found each time step with the property that they will arrive exactly on a node or vertex {{at the end of the}} step. This method called the quasi-lagrangian method in atmospheric sciences. A different method, and the one I shall talk about, is Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics or SPH. In this method the spatial derivatives are calculated directly from the particles using a simple interpolation. The resulting equations of motion look like the equations of molecular dynamics and SPH can therefore be considered as a valid way of approximating the continuum equations or as a model of the underlying molecular dynamics. The advantage of working directly with the particles is that when splash or fragmentation occurs it is easy to follow the transition from the continuum to the fragmented state. The original SPH calculations were applied to astrophysics, especially star formation, where there are huge changes in density, and a great deal of the space in which the stars move is empty of matter. Because most of the action is where the particles are it is efficient to work directly with the particles and this makes SPH codes very efficient. SPH can be generalized easily to adjust the resolution as the particles move together in a region of increasing density. No other method has this simplicity. Further improvements were associated with deriving the equations of motion from a Lagrangian which led to improved conservation properties. To extend the method to nearly incompressible fluids such as water, the only change required is to use an equation of state which is sufficiently stiff to make the density fluctuations negligible. In addition rigid boundaries must be included and this has been done by either using boundary force particles, or by using ghost particles. Free surfaces do not need a special treatment. With these techniques it has been possible to simulate waves breaking on beaches, dam breaks and a wide range of problems involving rigid bodies moving in one or more fluids and, more exotically, special effects in movies. In my presentation I will describe many of these applications. In particular I will describe new work on the swimming of linked rigid bodies which opens up the detailed application of SPH to swimming robots and swimming fish, even those that leap out of the water. The interested reader will find an extensive discussion of the theory in a recent review (Monaghan, Reports on Progress in Physics, 2005) ...|$|E

The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to numerically simulate the flow inside the disc refiner and to determine the factors influencing the development of flow in the rotor and the stator of the disc refiner. Simplified single groove model is used to analyze the flow in the rotor and stator of <b>the</b> refiner. <b>Fluid</b> is assumed to be Newtonian and single phase with dynamic viscosity 100 times higher than water. Model and mesh used for the rotor and stator are identical with different wall boundary conditions and fluid zone conditions. Simulations were performed with different pressure gradients and angular speed of the refiner. The study shows that the flow in the rotor depends on the pressure difference and the speed of the refiner. Flow in the stator depends on the pressure difference; speed has little effect on the flow in the stator. In <b>the</b> rotor <b>fluid</b> flows towards <b>the</b> periphery while in the stator direction of flow is towards origin. Rotational motion is observed both in the rotor and the stator groove.
