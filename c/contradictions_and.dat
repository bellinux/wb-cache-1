5|$|Anekāntavāda was {{analyzed}} and critiqued by Adi Sankarācārya (~800 CE) in his bhasya on Brahmasutra (2:2:33–36): He stated that anekantavada doctrine {{when applied to}} philosophy suffers from two problems: virodha (<b>contradictions)</b> <b>and</b> samsaya (dubiety), neither {{of which it is}} able to reconcile with objectivity.|$|E

25|$|Health {{officials}} say {{there are plenty of}} problems in China's approach to AIDS. There are frequent reports of police crack-downs on local NGOs involved in AIDS prevention. There have also been reports of police using the presence of a condom in a sex worker's handbag to justify detention. This has been partially blamed on policy incoordination, and <b>contradictions</b> <b>and</b> conflicts between laws and regulations.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, {{by means}} of {{examining}} the dates of various parts of Eim Habanim Semeichah, and by analyzing Teichtal's ideological stances during the various stages of his compilation, {{it becomes clear that}} the book does not present a clear-cut stand on any of the basic issues of Religious Zionism’s conceptions, as well as Orthodoxy’s beliefs. Moreover, Teichtal’s doctrines are filled with retractions and <b>contradictions,</b> <b>and</b> his positions swing from Hungarian Orthodoxy to Religious Zionist thought.|$|E
25|$|Xuanzang {{was fully}} ordained as a monk in 622, {{at the age}} of twenty. The myriad <b>contradictions</b> <b>and</b> {{discrepancies}} in the texts at that time prompted Xuanzang to decide to go to India and study in the cradle of Buddhism. He subsequently left his brother and returned to Chang'an to study foreign languages and to continue his study of Buddhism. He began his mastery of Sanskrit in 626, and probably also studied Tocharian. During this time, Xuanzang also became interested in the metaphysical Yogacara school of Buddhism.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{scholarship}} {{approaches the}} various known {{stories of the}} myth as cumulative elaborations and later interpretations of Roman foundation-myth. Particular versions and collations were presented by Roman historians as authoritative, an official history trimmed of <b>contradictions</b> <b>and</b> untidy variants to justify contemporary developments, genealogies and actions in relation to Roman morality. Other narratives appear to represent popular or folkloric tradition; some of these remain inscrutable in purpose and meaning. Wiseman sums the whole as the mythography of an unusually problematic foundation and early history.|$|E
25|$|He {{picks up}} {{narratives}} left hanging from previous albums, magnifies recurring themes and takes signature production techniques to extremes. The album's structure – a seamless {{ebb and flow}} of interlinked songs – is dizzyingly grandiose, underpinned by a complementary sense of theatre and elegance. Most importantly, though, through these devices, Nash reveals {{more and more of the}} <b>contradictions</b> <b>and</b> complexities at the core of his work: the instability generated by his obsessive examination of traditional R tropes – love, sex, money – from every possible angle; the frictions of his own fractured self-perception.|$|E
25|$|A {{physical}} {{paradox is}} an apparent contradiction in physical {{descriptions of the}} universe. While many physical paradoxes have accepted resolutions, others defy resolution and may indicate flaws in theory. In physics as in all of science, <b>contradictions</b> <b>and</b> paradoxes are generally assumed to be artifacts of error and incompleteness because reality {{is assumed to be}} completely consistent, although this is itself a philosophical assumption. When, as in fields such as quantum physics and relativity theory, existing assumptions about reality have been shown to break down, this has usually been dealt with by changing our understanding of reality to a new one which remains self-consistent {{in the presence of the}} new evidence.|$|E
40|$|Recently {{several authors}} have {{stressed}} and illustrated {{the importance of}} including a second kind of negation (explicit negation) in logic programs besides "negation as failure", and its use in deductive databases, knowledge representation, and nonmonotonic reasoning. By introducing explicit negation into logic programs contradiction may appear. In this work we present two approaches for dealing with <b>contradiction,</b> <b>and</b> show their equivalence. One of the approaches consists in avoiding <b>contradiction,</b> <b>and</b> is based on restrictions in the adoption of abductive hypotheses. The other approach consists in removing <b>contradiction,</b> <b>and</b> {{is based on a}} transformation of contradictory programs into noncontradictory ones, guided by the reasons for contradiction. The work is divided into two parts: one is presented in this paper, <b>and</b> comprises the <b>contradiction</b> avoidance approach, <b>and</b> the other in [16] in this volume, comprises the <b>contradiction</b> removal approach <b>and</b> shows the equivalence between the [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Some modern deists have {{modified}} this classical {{view and}} believe that humanity's relationship with God is transpersonal, which means that God transcends the personal/impersonal duality and moves beyond such human terms. Also, this means that {{it makes no sense}} to state that God intervenes or does not intervene, as that is a human characteristic that God does not contain. Modern deists believe that they must continue what the classical deists started and continue to use modern human knowledge to come to understand God, which in turn is why a human-like God that can lead to numerous <b>contradictions</b> <b>and</b> inconsistencies is no longer believed in and has been replaced with a much more abstract conception.|$|E
25|$|Research into paraconsistent logic {{has also}} led to the {{establishment}} of the philosophical school of dialetheism (most notably advocated by Graham Priest), which asserts that true contradictions exist in reality, for example groups of people holding opposing views on various moral issues. Being a dialetheist rationally commits one to some form of paraconsistent logic, on pain of otherwise embracing trivialism, i.e. accepting that all <b>contradictions</b> (<b>and</b> equivalently all statements) are true. However, the study of paraconsistent logics does not necessarily entail a dialetheist viewpoint. For example, one need not commit to either the existence of true theories or true contradictions, but would rather prefer a weaker standard like empirical adequacy, as proposed by Bas van Fraassen.|$|E
25|$|The Lex Frisionum of the duchy of Frisia {{consists}} of a medley of documents of the most heterogeneous character. Some of its enactments are purely pagan, thus one paragraph allows the mother to kill her new-born child, and another prescribes the immolation to the gods of the defiler of their temple; others are purely Christian, {{such as those that}} prohibit incestuous marriages and working on Sunday. The law abounds in <b>contradictions</b> <b>and</b> repetitions, and the compositions are calculated in different moneys. From this it appears the documents were merely materials collected from various sources and possibly with a view to the compilation of a homogeneous law. These materials were apparently brought together {{at the beginning of the}} 9th century, at a time of intense legislative activity at the court of Charlemagne.|$|E
