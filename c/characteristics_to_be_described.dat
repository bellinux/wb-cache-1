40|$|AbstractCurrent mining {{activities}} of the OKD mines are primarily focused on coal seams within the Karvina Formation in the Karvina sub-basin. A considerable amount of coal reserves are situated in protection pillars that lie under built-up areas. The longwall mining method is not applicable in these areas because significant deformation of the surface is not permitted. For this reason OKD is considering using alternative methods of mining to minimise subsidence. The room and pillar method has been trialed with specific coal pillars in order to minimise strata convergence. The method was implemented in the shaft protective pillar at the CSM Mine and is the first application {{of the room and}} pillar mining method within the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. Mining depth reached up to 900  m and is perhaps the deepest room and pillar panel in the world. To determine pillar stability, vertical stress was measured in two adjacent coal pillars which are diamond in shape and located within a row of pillars forming the panel. Two pillars diamond in shape and slightly irregular sides were approximately 860  m 2 and 1200  m 2 in size and 3. 5  m high To measure the increase in vertical stress due to mining, four stress cells were installed in each coal pillar. Four 5 -level multipoint rib extensometers measured displacements of all sides within each monitored pillar. The results of stress-state and pillar displacement monitoring allowed pillar loading and yielding <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>described.</b> This data and other analyses are essential to establishing procedures for a safe room and pillar method of mining within the Upper Silesian Coal Basin...|$|E
40|$|T. H. White's Arthurian {{books have}} been {{consistently}} popular with the general public, but have received limited critical attention. It is possible that such critical neglect {{is caused by the}} books' failure to conform to the generic norms of the mainstream novel, the dominant form of prose fiction in the twentieth century. This thesis explores the way in which various genres combine in The Once and Future King [...] Genre theory, as developed by Northrop Frye and Alastair Fowler, is the basis of the study. Neither theory is applied fully, but Frye's and Fowler's ideas about the function of genre as an interpretive tool underpin the study. The genre study proper begins with an examination of the generic repertoire of the mainstream novel. A study of The Qnce and Future King in relation to this form reveals that it exhibits some of its features, notably characterization and narrative, but that it conspicuously lacks the kind of setting typical of the mainstream novel. A similar approach is followed with other subgenres of prose fiction: the historical novel; romance; fantasy; utopia. In each case The Once and Future King is found to exhibit some key features, unique to that form, although without sufficient of its <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> fully in those terms. The function of the comic and tragic modes within The Qnce änd Future King is also considered. White succeeds in combining the two to create a particular sense of idealism and loss.

This work focused on the development of a hysteretic model with nonlinear, inelastic, degrading and pinching capabilities to predict the in-plane shear response of SDRC diaphragms under earthquake loads, and the definition of an analytical modeling scheme to include the effects of the diaphragm flexibility in the analysis of frame-wall structures;Predictive equations describing the hysteretic characteristics of the model were developed. Developed expressions consisted of the envelope curve equation, strength degradation factor, pinch force equation, hysteresis curve equation, and loop stiffness equations. Two different approaches were used in the model development: analytical and statistical method. The analytical method was used for the prediction of the pre-peak force-displacement envelope curve, and was based on strain compatibility and equilibrium conditions. Additionally, edge connectors and deck-to-concrete flexibility were included in this scheme;The statistical approach was based on results of 32 full-scale SDRC diaphragms tested under in-plane loads that were part of a previous phase of the research program at ISU. A pool of eleven regression models <b>was</b> used <b>to</b> select the model with the lowest mean absolute error for each particular <b>characteristic</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>described.</b> Linear, multilinear, nonlinear, and stepwise regression analyses <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> identify parameters that significantly improved the predicted response;A review of the state-of-art in analytical macro-modelling of steel and concrete members was made.

40|$|AbstractCertain {{macrophage}} phenotypes {{contribute to}} tissue fibrosis, but why? Tissues host resident mononuclear phagocytes {{for their support}} to maintain homeostasis. Upon injury the changing tissue microenvironment alters their phenotype and primes infiltrating monocytes toward pro-inflammatory macrophages. Several mechanisms contribute to their deactivation and macrophage priming toward anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative macrophages that produce multiple cytokines that display immunosuppressive as well as pro-regeneratory effects, such as IL- 10 and TGF-beta 1. Insufficient parenchymal repair creates a tissue microenvironment that becomes dominated by multiple growth factors that promote the pro-fibrotic macrophage phenotype that itself produces large amounts of such growth factors that further support fibrogenesis. However, the contribution of resident mononuclear phagocytes to physiological extracellular matrix turnover implies also their fibrolytic effects in the late stage of tissue scaring. Fibrolytic macrophages break down fibrous tissue, but their phenotypic <b>characteristics</b> remain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> in more detail. Together, macrophages contribute to tissue fibrosis because the changing tissue environments prime them to assist and orchestrate all phases of tissue injury and repair.

To determine feasibility of energy crops for alternative fuels, research <b>is</b> needed <b>to</b> investigate dry matter yield over an extended harvest season; physical <b>characteristics</b> need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> for potential harvesting problems; chemical <b>characteristics</b> described <b>to</b> identify selective harvest potential, optimal harvest timing, losses during harvest and storage; various harvest techniques investigated to identify potential cost savings; and impact of various storage techniques on {{quantity and quality of}} deliverable biomass. This study investigated the use of two sorghum varieties as a potential bioenergy feedstock where 20 ha were planted for three years. Standing crop samples were collected from August through January to document changes in dry matter yield, moisture, height, fiber content, proximate and ultimate analysis. The sorghum was cut and conditioned ? as a two-cutting ratoon or single-cutting ? using various mower-conditioners and windrow samples taken daily to determine best method of field drying, quantify dry matter loss and soil entrainment. Two storage methods were utilized ? baling with wrapping in a tubeline, and chopping and compressing in bag using a modified cotton module builder ? to determine best method of storage for reduced dry matter loss. The optimal time of harvest for maximum dry matter occurred with the November once-cut where 30 Mg ha^- 1 was documented, but comparable yields were observed with the two-cutting scenario. Fiber content increased with maturity, peaked, and declined, while ash content and moisture decreased with maturity. The achievement of 55 % moisture in January shows field curing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> necessary for transportation at any significant distance, but soil entrainment ? as measured by ash concentration ? <b>was</b> not found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a significant problem after conditioning, multiple windrow inversions, and harvesting.

Therefore, the focus of the following research <b>is</b> <b>to</b> expand our understanding of the developmental steps of spermiogenesis in snakes by studying spermatids in Pelamis platurus caught in Costa Rica in 2010. The testes were removed and the tissues were processed with standard electron microscopy. The spermatids of P. platurus share many similar ultrastructural <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> what has <b>been</b> <b>described</b> for other squamates. Two notable differences between the spermatids of P. platurus and those of other snakes is a more prominent central lacuna within the nucleus and radiating arrays of longitudinal manchette microtubules. The P. platurus epinuclear lucent zone is shorter in comparison to other squamates and may be a synapomorphy for snakes.

40|$|In {{vehicles}} with electric transmission and independent wheel stations, it <b>is</b> possible <b>to</b> have a possibility to control propulsion, {{steering and suspension}} individually for each wheel. This {{makes it possible to}} improve mobility, performance and driving safety. The long term goal of this work <b>is</b> <b>to</b> develop a methodt hat can evaluate and improve the mobility of such vehicles in terrain. This contribution concerns how a six wheeled electric transmission vehicle should <b>be</b> modelled <b>to</b> enable evaluation of the dynamic behaviour in different type of terrain. This is made by combining modelling of vehicle, transmission and tire-terrain behaviour. For wheeled vehicles an electric transmission with hub motors provides the ability to accurately control the torque on every wheel independently, giving a great ability to improve both mobility in terrain and vehicle behaviour on road. In this work the components of a diesel-electric powertrain for off-road vehicles are modelled and a control layout with the possibility to include functions for improved performance both while driving off- and on-road <b>is</b> proposed. <b>To</b> handle driving on soft ground, a tire/terrain model is needed. The model should include lateral deformation in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> steer. A tire/terrain model is derived based on the ideas of Wong and Reece. The terrain <b>characteristics</b> <b>are</b> chosen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> by parameters according to the Bekker model, since this data are widely available in literature. The developed tire/terrain model has been implemented together with a vehicle model. This terrain vehicle model <b>is</b> shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> estimate sinkage, rolling resistance, traction force and steering characteristics, of a six wheeledterrain vehicle using electric transmission. To conclude, models of a six-wheeled vehicle with electric transmission and tire models both for soft and rigid ground have been developed. These models form a simulation platform, which makes it possible to evaluate control strategies for the electric transmission with the purpose to improve mobility. QC 2010111...|$|R
40|$|Recently, lithic {{projectile}} points {{have become}} {{a key element in}} discussions about the complexity of Palaeolithic human behavior. The appearance of different projection systems has certainly {{played an important role in}} technological changes that occurred during the Palaeolithic. Unfortunately, only the lithic components of these projection systems are generally recovered, and over the years, several studies have focused on finding macroscopic and microscopic evidence that would allow the identification of potential lithic projectile points in the archaeological record. Initial studies used a more typological approach to describe the morphology of the damage observed, while subsequent studies used a terminology based on the description of fracture initiations and terminations. At present, there is quite some variation in the descriptions of the wear features and fractures observed, both in their detail as in the elements that are considered as being diagnostic of projectile use. While discussion may reign about the latter, it is clear that the descriptive framework that is currently used lacks some homogeneity and if one wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> evaluate the degree to which evidence may or may not be diagnostic of projectile use, it is important that we share a common vocabulary and that we agree on the fracture and wear <b>characteristics</b> that ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>described.</b> Some attributes <b>are</b> only mentioned infrequently, such as the size of certain removals as well as the association between different fracture types or damage features on a single piece. Independent of their potential importance, it often makes it difficult to compare the wear features observed between different researchers as well as to make robust statements about the diagnostic value of certain traces or fractures. We present a synthesis of the variation in terminology that was identified in projectile studies and we attempt to document what researchers have referred to with specific descriptions. Above all, we would like to open discussion in view of the creation of a shared and systematic descriptive framework for wear features or fractures that may potentially result from projectile use...|$|R
40|$|Root {{length and}} {{diameter}} distribution <b>are</b> important <b>characteristics</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered when <b>describing</b> and comparing root systems. Root length and root-diameter distribution {{may be obtained}} in two ways: by microscopical measurements, which are laborious, or by computerised analysis, which is fast but sensitive to the scanning protocol. Although scanning protocols vary widely between laboratories, papers rarely report the details. Using two commercially available root analysis software packages (Delta-T Scan and WinRHIZO), we performed a sensitivity analysis of scanning protocols for estimating root length and diameter distribution. The results are shown graphically, rather than numerically, because the interactions between different parameters in the overall scanning protocol are most clearly illustrated by {{the shape of the}} curves. The present analysis clearly demonstrated the sensitivity of the two scanning methods with regard to staining period, maximum root density, scanning resolution and transformation threshold. For example, estimating the root-diameter distribution versus measuring root length, puts opposite constraints on the transformation threshold settings. We suggest the following settings for the most sensitive parameters: a staining period of 24 h, a root density of less than 0. 5 mm root per mm(2) surface, a resolution of 400 dpi and the automatic threshold for WinRHIZO and a brightness of 200 for Delta-T Scan. According to this protocol, comparison of computerised analyses with microscopic measurements showed good total root length and diameter distribution agreement for three contrasting root systems. We suggest to always start with the present protocol when studying other species. If validation indicates that the proposed scanning protocol needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> modified for other species, the present sensitivity analysis may be used as a guideline for changing the most critical parameters. Similarly, the use of another stain than neutral red may also require modifications of the scanning protocol. In general, a long staining period (e. g., 24 h) is recommended for all stains, as small differences in staining period have the least effect when the root tissue <b>is</b> saturated. <b>To</b> enhance comparability of results in the literature, the staining period, stain, (maximum) root density, scanner resolution and threshold should always be listed when root data obtained by scanning are presented.

Patients and Settings: Patients presenting to the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, Radiology Department for CT Pulmonary Angiography and Lower Limb compression ultrasonography with Doppler formed the study population. Methodology: All eligible patients undergoing CT pulmonary angiography and compression ultrasonography during the study period were entered into a database. In those found to have venous thromboembolism, a questionnaire <b>was</b> administered <b>to</b> assess risk factors, presentation, treatment and outcome of venous thromboembolism, with subsequent analysis. The prevalence of venous thromboembolism amongst those undergoing CT pulmonary angiography and compression ultrasonography was calculated as a proportion with 95 % confidence interval. Results: Four hundred and ninety one patients had CT pulmonary angiography and lower limb compression ultrasonography with Doppler of which 55 <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> have venous thromboembolism. The prevalence of venous thromboembolism was 11. 2 % (95 % C. I 8. 41 - 13. 99). Twenty eight patients (50. 9 %) had risk factors as described by Wells, with the most common being malignancy, the bedridden state and a previous history of venous thromboembolism, each occurring in 7 (12. 7 %) of the patients with risk factors. The most common clinical presentations were dyspnoea (73. 3 %), chest pain (40 %) and tachycardia (53. 3 %) for pulmonary embolism, and lower limb swelling (88 %) and lower limb pain (88 %) for deep vein thrombosis. Eighteen (33 %) of the 55 patients with venous thromboembolism were initiated on low molecular weight heparin which was the most common initial therapy used. In contrast the most common discharge anticoagulant was rivaroxaban used in 19 (44 %) of hospitalized patients at discharge. Mean length of hospital stay was 4. 2 days (SD± 2. 1 days, range 1 - 11 days). Admission to critical care units occurred in 22 (48. 9 %) of admitted patients. Two patients (4. 4 %) had major bleeding episodes while 2 patients (4. 4 %) died {{in the course of the}} admission. Conclusion: Based on these results we concluded that the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing lower limb compression ultrasonography with doppler, and CT pulmonary angiography at the Aga Khan University Hospital was 11. 2 % (95 % CI 8. 41 - 13. 94). Half of the patients with venous thromboembolism did not have risk factors as described by Wells. Dyspnoea, chest pain, tachycardia and lower limb pain and swelling were common presenting symptoms and signs. The most common discharge medication was a novel oral anticoagulant. There was a high rate of admission to critical care, though overall hospital stay was short. Major bleeding and in hospital mortality was rare...|$|R
40|$|OASIS defines Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) as a {{paradigm}} for organizing and utilizing distributed capabilities {{that may be}} {{under the control of}} different ownership domains. One approach <b>to</b> realize SOA <b>is</b> Web services. A Web service is a software system that has a machine processable Web Services Description Language (WSDL) interface; other systems interact with it using SOAP messages in a manner prescribed by its description. Descriptions enable Web services <b>to</b> <b>be</b> discovered, used by other Web services, and composed into new Web services. Composition is a mechanism for rapid creation of new Web services by reusing existing ones. Web services have functional, behavioral, semantic, and non-functional characteristics. These <b>characteristics</b> have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered for composition, as they provide essential information about the services. In order to compose Web services with these <b>characteristics,</b> they have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> appropriately. However, the existing techniques do not consider all these aspects together for description and composition. This thesis proposes a business model, also referred to as architecture, a description framework, and a composition framework for Web service composition. Techniques for matching, categorizing, and assembling the composite services are also proposed {{as a part of the}} composition framework. The architecture, frameworks, and techniques describe, discover, manipulate, and compose Web services by taking into account all their characteristics. The standard Web service business model is extended by the proposed business model to support Web service composition. In the model, based on their demand, the requested Web services are composed by the Web service composer. In the proposed architecture, Web services <b>are</b> <b>described</b> using the description framework languages. The proposed framework combines Semantic Annotations for WSDL and XML Schema (SAWSDL) for functional and semantic description, Message Sequence Charts (MSC) for behavioral description, and a simple and new Non Functional Specification Language (NFSL) for the non-functional properties description of Web services. It uses Higher Order Logic (HOL) for formalizing and integrating the three languages. The role of Web service composer in the architecture is realized by the composition framework. It essentially defines the architecture of the composer. In this framework, matchmaking, categorization, and assembly techniques <b>are</b> used <b>to</b> create the requested composite service. These techniques manipulate the Web services at HOL-level. The formal matchmaking technique discovers the primitive Web services by using a HOL theorem prover. The categorization and the assembly techniques manipulate the matched services and orchestrate the composite service. The concepts of the model, frameworks, and techniques are implemented, and their working is illustrated using case studies. Prototypes of the model's components (extended registry and extended requester) and the composition framework are developed, and their performance is analyzed.
