40|$|Abstract: We study optimal {{design of}} the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) chart by a proper choice of the {{smoothing}} factor and the initial value (headstart) of the decision statistic. The particular problem addressed is that of quickest detection of an abrupt change in the parameter of a discrete-time exponential model. Both pre- and post-change parameter values are assumed known, but the change-point is not known. For this change-point detection scenario, we examine {{the performance of the}} conventional one-sided EWMA chart with respect to two optimality criteria: Pollak’s minimax criterion associated with the maximal conditional expected delay to detection and Shiryaev’s multi-cyclic setup associated with the stationary expected delay to detection. Using the integral-equations approach, we derive the exact closed-form formulae for all of the required performance measures. Based on these formulae we find the optimal smoothing factor and headstart by solving the corresponding two bivariate constraint optimization problems. Finally, the performance of the optimized EWMA chart is compared against that of the Shiryaev–Roberts– r procedure in the minimax setting, and against that of the original Shiryaev–Roberts procedure in the multi-cyclic setting. The main conclusion is that the EWMA chart, when fully optimized, {{turns out to be a}} very <b>competitive</b> <b>procedure,</b> <b>with</b> performance nearly indistinguishable from that of the known-to-be-best Shiryaev–Roberts–r and Shiryaev–Roberts procedures...|$|R

40|$|Objective {{to analyze}} the {{procurements}} of the executive authority of the Republic of Crimea in the transition period and to evaluate their effectiveness. 	Methods the study used the methods of grouping {{vertical and horizontal analysis}} economicmathematical modeling. 	Results after the Republic of Crimea disconnection from the Ukraine and subsequent accession to the Russian Federation the state customers in the region were in a difficult situation due to the adaptation of the existing procurement system to the Russian legislation norms. Basing on the data of the Republic of Crimea Ministry of Justice the authors analyzed the state procurement across all stages of changing the legal field for the customers of the Republic. On the basis of the study it is concluded that under the Ukrainian legislation the bulk of procurements was carried out without <b>competitive</b> <b>procedures</b> while the remaining purchases showed the low level of savings. We also revealed the increase of procurement procedures complexity after the Republic accession to the Russian Federation while during the transition period the customers made procurements 	according to a simplified procedure. The analysis of the procurement effectiveness for the customer showed {{that as a result of}} legislative changes the number and value of competitive procurements significantly increased as well as the saving rate of tenders and auctions. On the basis of correlationregression model the authors have proved the hypothesis that number of the procurement participants has an effect on the savings rate. As a result the necessity of increasing the number of competitive procurements was substantiated since the number of participants directly affects the savings rate in the course of bidding. 	Scientific novelty on the basis of the analysis the authors showed a positive economic effect from the changes in the legal framework of public procurement for a particular customer ndash the Republic of Crimea which was manifested in the growth of savings rate and the number of <b>competitive</b> <b>procedures.</b> <b>With</b> economicmathematical methods the authors proved the hypothesis that the saving rate increased following the results of procurement procedures if the number of participants of the auctions and tenders increased. According to the results of the analysis proposals for improving the contract procurement system are formulated. 	Practical significance the proposed recommendations can be used by state customers and public authorities in procurement procedures and changes in laws and regulations in the field of public procurement with the aim of improving the efficiency of the contract system...|$|R

30|$|In this research, {{utilizing}} its excellent {{properties and}} advantages, we firstly proposed a wireless ME nanobiosensor employing the ME material as the substrate and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as the coating layer, for atrazine detection at ppb level {{on the basis}} of the direct <b>competitive</b> immunoassay <b>procedures.</b> Compared <b>with</b> the covalent-random antibody immobilization, the covalent-oriented strategy is more beneficial to improve the sensitivity of the nanobiosensor. Because the protein A is an interesting alternative to specifically bind with the Fc immunoglobulin region of the antibody, it was employed for oriented immobilization of the atrazine antibody [30], giving the highest immobilization density, to exhibit better antigen binding efficiency and improve nanobiosensor’s performance [31]. The direct competitive immunoassay for atrazine was constructed by oriented immobilization of atrazine antibody to protein A covalently modified on the AuNPs-coated ME material surface, followed by the competitive reaction of atrazine–albumin conjugate (Atr–BSA) and atrazine with the atrazine antibody. Atr–BSA was induced to amplify the signal responses, in turn significantly increasing the sensitivity of the nanobiosensor. The efficiency of the ME nanobiosensor was evaluated, demonstrating that a novel ME nanobiosensor for the detection of trace concentrations of atrazine was successfully developed.|$|R

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{capacity of}} some calcium antagonists and one calcium agonist 1, 4 -dihydropyridines (DHPs) was evaluated by a <b>competitive</b> kinetic <b>procedure.</b> <b>With</b> {{the exception of}} Amlodipine, all the calcium antagonist DHPs display an unambiguous antioxidant capacity, while for the calcium agonist DHP (Bay K 8644) no measurable reactivity towards peroxyl radicals could be detected. The finding was corroborated by an electroanalytical investigation of the redox properties of DHPs compounds to get an insight about both the thermodynamic constraints of their oxidation process and reaction pattern. The oxidation potentials decrease with both antioxidant capacity and increasing basic character, thus suggesting {{the relevance of the}} electron density on the DHP ring. For all the compounds investigated, the overall oxidation process takes place through a primary one-electron step accompanied by a fast proton release and the formation of a neutral radical undergoing a second much easier one-electron step. The protonated form of the parent pyridine derivative is thus generated as the final product. This pattern is relevant for the antioxidant effect, since the radical intermediate is much more prone to be oxidized than to be reduced, thus fully preventing the propagation of the oxidative chain reaction. In the case of calcium antagonist DHPs, the above release of protons complicates the overall oxidation process by introducing a parasitic side reaction where a coupling between protons and the starting species takes place. This DHP self-protonation subtracts part of the original species from the electrode process because the parent cationic species is no longer electroactive. Conversely, the calcium agonist DHP, which is more difficult to be oxidized, turned out to be such a weak base as to be unable to undergo the self-protonation reaction. The combined effect of oxidation potentials and proton binding capacity of DHPs is a key element for the redox transition, which could support their antioxidant effect and should be considered to some extent in accounting for the calcium antagonist vs calcium agonist effect...|$|R
