Polyoxyethylene–polypropylene block copolymer (poloxamer 188) was employed as a hydrophilic carrier to prepare simvastatin solid dispersions (SDs). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffractometry were employed to understand the interaction between the drug and the carrier in the solid state. The results obtained from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed absence of any chemical interaction between the drug and poloxamer. The results of differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffractometry confirmed the conversion of simvastatin to distorted crystalline state. The SD of 1 : 2 w/w drug to carrier ratio showed the highest dissolution; hence, it was incorporated in RDT formulations using a 32 full factorial design and response surface methodology. The initial assessments of RDTs demonstrated an acceptable flow, hardness, and friability to indicate good mechanical strength. The interaction and Pareto charts indicated that percentage of <b>croscarmellose</b> sodium incorporated was the most important factor affecting the disintegration time and dissolution parameter followed by the hardness value and their interaction effect. Compression force showed a superior influence to increase RDT’s porosity and to fasten disintegration rather than swelling action by <b>croscarmellose</b> sodium.

These results suggest a dissolution/Caco- 2 system to be an experimentally based tool that may predict dissolution-absorption relationships from oral solid dosage forms, and hence the relative contributions of dissolution and permeation to oral drug absorption kinetics...|$|E
40|$|Atenolol is a {{recognized}} drug for hypertension therefore {{development of an}} FDT of Atenolol and to evaluate the effect of co-processed superdisintegrants on its disintegration time and release profile was the prime objective of this research work. Tablets were prepared by direct compression technique using two different superdisintegrants in combination by co-process mixing and by physical mixing. <b>Croscarmellose</b> sodium and Crospovidone were used as superdisintegrants in combinations in the different ratio (1 : 1, 1 : 2 & 1 : 3). The developed superdisintegrants were evaluated for angle of repose, Carr’s index and Hausner’s ratio in comparison with physical mixture of superdisintegrants. The angle of repose of the developed excipients {{was found to be}} < 250, Carr’s index in the range of 10 - 15 % and Hausner’s ratio in the range of 1. 11 - 1. 14. Fast dissolving tablets of Atenolol were prepared using the co-processed superdisintegrants and evaluated for pre-compression and post compression parameters. Based on in-vitro dispersion time (approximately 20 sec) CP 1 formulation was tested for in-vitro drug release pattern in pH 6. 8 Phosphate buffer and drug excipients interaction were studied with DSC. Among the designed formulations, the formulation (CP 1) containing 4 % w/w of co-processed superdisintegrants (1 : 1 mixture of Crospovidone and <b>Croscarmellose</b> sodium) emerged as the overall best formulation based on drug release characteristics in pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, fast {{disintegrating}} tablets of prochlorperazine maleate were designed {{with a view}} to enhance patient compliance by direct compression method. In this method, crospovidone (up to 3 % w/w) and <b>croscarmellose</b> sodium (up to 5 % w/w) in combination were used as superdisintegrants. Since disintegrants complement each other, accelerating the disintegration process when used together. Estimation of prochlorperazine maleate in the prepared tablet formulations was carried out by extracting the drug with methanol and measuring the absorbance at 254. 5 nm. The prepared formulations were further evaluated for hardness, friability, drug content uniformity, in vitro dispersion time, wetting time and water absorption ratio. Based on in vitro dispersion time (approximately 12 s), one promising formulation was tested for in vitro drug release pattern in phosphate buffer pH 6. 8 and short-term stability (at 40 °/ 70 % RH for 3 mo), drug-excipient interaction (IR spectroscopy) were studied. Among the formulations tested, formulation DCPC 4 containing 5 % w/w of <b>croscarmellose</b> sodium and 3 % w/w of crospovidone as superdisintegrant emerged as the overall best (t 50 % 7. 0 min) based on drug release characteristics in pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer compared to commercial conventional tablet formulation (t 50 % 17. 4 min). Short-term stability studies on the promising formulation indicated that there were no significant changes in drug content and in vitro dispersion time (p< 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to mask the intensely bitter taste of metoclopramide hydrochloride and to formulate a rapid-disintegrating tablet of the taste-masked drug. Taste masking was done by complexing the drug with ion exchange resin, Indion 204 and Indion 214, in different ratios. The complex loading process was optimized for the concentration of resin, swelling time, stirring time, pH, and temperature for maximum drug loading. Drug-resin complexes (DRC) were tested for flow properties, drug content, in-vitro release in simulated salivary fluid, and in simulated gastric fluid (SGF), taste evaluation by the panel method. Taste evaluation of DRC revealed considerable taste masking with the degree of bitterness below threshold value (40 &# 956;g/ml) in 0 to 5 min. Complex of both Indion 204 and Indion 214 masked the taste, but {{on the basis of the}} comparative study, resin 214 was selected for taste masking property. Disintegrant <b>croscarmellose</b> (5 &#x 0025; wt/wt) gave the minimum disintegration time in comparison to crosspovidone and sodium starch glycolate. The batch of tablet containing Pearlitol SD and Avicel (PH 102) in the ratio 60 : 40 and 5 &#x 0025; (wt/wt) <b>Croscarmellose</b> showed faster disintegration i. e. 32 s, as compare to marketed tablet. It also revealed rapid drug release (t 80, 6 min) in SGF compared with marketed formulation (t 80, 9 min) ...|$|E
