5|$|Federal {{and state}} laws {{regulating}} hours, wages, {{and working conditions}} changed markedly in the United States during the early 20thcentury. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight-hour maximum. In 1920, to lower <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> regulations {{and the rise of}} organized labor, several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a pickup and delivery service popular among middle-class families. The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927.|$|E

5|$|There {{was still}} fog on the plateau on 1 September, but by 15:00 CEST it was {{possible}} to fly a team there by helicopter. Because the fog stayed, the team retained work until 03:00 CEST in the night. In the following days, the fog lifted, making work and transport easier. By 5 September, all bodies had been recovered and the work at the plateau could be terminated. The recovery in the valley was completed two days later. The accident resulted in about 40 journalists staying in Svalbard to cover the story. The Norwegian authority's <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the investigation and other activities related to the accident were estimated at 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK).|$|E
25|$|In October 2005, JetBlue's {{quarterly}} profit had plunged from US$8.1million to $2.7million {{largely due}} to rising fuel costs. Operational issues, fuel prices, and low fares, JetBlue's hallmark, were bringing its financial performance down. In addition, with higher <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the airline's numerous amenities, JetBlue was becoming less competitive.|$|E

30|$|This section {{evaluates the}} {{signaling}} cost {{performance of the}} BS and the DMRS based on the PIM-SM at the MAGs and also compares with the MIP-BT and the MIP-RS schemes [3]. In this paper, the signaling cost {{is defined as the}} product of signaling message size and hop distance, and the unit is in bytes × hops [38]. Signaling cost has two major components: (i) signaling <b>cost</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the mobility management and (ii) signaling <b>cost</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the packet transmission [39]. We analyze the signaling cost of these schemes for both the above components through mathematical analysis.|$|R
40|$|We {{compute the}} {{opportunity}} cost for rational risk averse agents of using technical trading {{rules in the}} foreign exchange rate market. We decompose this opportunity cost into two parts: (i) a <b>cost</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the misallocation of wealth, which increases with the investor's level of risk aversion (allocational cost); and (ii) a <b>cost</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the investor's erroneous belief regarding {{the sign of the}} expected excess return (expectational cost). We find that even for low levels of risk aversion the opportunity cost of using chartist rules tends to be prohibitively high. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|From the {{literature}} review, regarding the inventory models in fixed time horizon, {{it is seen}} that the ordering cost is always fixed for all cycles. But, realistically it is not correct. Basically, when a retailer orders the materials to the supplier, then there exists two types of cost such as fixed cost and variable cost. The fixed cost consists of the <b>cost</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> facilities, telephone and maintenance of computer system to process the purchase orders. The variable cost is the <b>cost</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the shipments of the purchase quantities. Obviously this type of cost depends on number of replenishment cycles to be processed as {{when the number of}} replenishment cycle is increased the ordering amount decreases per cycle or vice-versa.|$|R
30|$|Next, we {{will find}} the optimal {{controls}}, namely the controls that optimize our objective function. Regarding this work, {{we will find}} a set of controls that minimizes the number of exposed human, symptomatically infected human, and {{the total number of}} mosquitoes as well as the costs associated with implementing the control strategy. The constants A_ 1, A_ 2, and A_ 3, are the weighted constants associated with exposed human, symptomatically infected human, and the total number of mosquito, respectively. The constants B_ 1, B_ 2, and B_ 3 are the weighted constants of the control variables u_ 1, u_ 2 and u_ 3, respectively. The terms 1 / 2 B_ 1 u_ 1 ^ 2, 1 / 2 B_ 2 u_ 2 ^ 2, and 1 / 2 B_ 3 u_ 3 ^ 2 are the costs associated with implementing each of the three controls. The <b>cost</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the first control might be the expenses of using insect repellent, mosquito net, and herbal spray for instance. The <b>cost</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> second control might be the expenses of providing protections or warning leaflets about the safe sexual activity. The <b>cost</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the last control could come from the expenses of using mosquito pesticides and the process implementation.|$|R

Civilian governmental organizations which JRCC SN can call upon are the Norwegian Police Service, ambulances, the Norwegian Air Ambulance, municipal fire departments and the fire and rescue services at airports. The Coastal Administration, the Climate and Pollution Agency and the Directorate of Fisheries operate a fleet of vessels along the coast. Advice can be called from the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute and the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.|$|E
25|$|On value, Petty {{continued}} the debate begun by Aristotle, and chose {{to develop an}} input-based theory of value: all things ought to be valued by two natural Denominations, which is Land and Labour (p.44). Both of these would be prime sources of taxable income. Like Richard Cantillon after him, he sought to devise some equation or par between the 'mother and father' of output, land and labour, and to express value accordingly. He still included general productivity, one's 'art and industry'. He applied his theory of value to rent. The natural rent of a land was the excess of what a labourer produces on it in a year over what he ate himself and traded for necessities. It was therefore the profit above the various <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the factors involved in production.|$|E
25|$|Into the 2000s, {{the school}} came under {{criticism}} {{for keeping the}} entirety of the increasingly taxed Norval property while so little of it was actually used; this argument has gained increased credence in light of the consistent yearly tuition hikes and mounting legal costs. Despite repeated assertions that the college had no intention of selling the property, citing not only rapidly increasing land value, but also an intention to hold it in order to prevent industrial development on land that contains a variety of wildlife, including spotted deer and hares, UCC sold {{a small portion of the}} acreage in 2007 to help cover <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the 2003 class action lawsuit brought against the school by former students. In 2011, the Norval Long-Range Planning Committee recommended that Norval's facilities should be expanded to allow for more overnight students and co-educational use.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, the {{repeated}} operational breaks and high <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Bergen Line past Finse {{was a constant}} problem for NSB and in 1983 the director, Robert Nordén launched {{the idea of a}} tunnel through the mountain. He was backed by the engineering staff in NSB, who felt that a tunnel would be a simple way of solving many of the challenges relating to the railway operations. Estimates calculated the cost of the investment at , including the upgrade of part of the line east of Finse Station. In addition to the argument for better regularity on the Bergen Line, NSB pointed out that the cost structure of railway operations had changed, making it relatively more expensive to operate snow sheds, that required rebuilding about every twenty years, than to build a tunnel, that would be excavated using heavy and automated machinery. NSB launched the idea to start construction after Oslo Central Station was scheduled for completion in 1989.|$|E
