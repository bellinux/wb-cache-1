Below the controls sits the 5-speed manual transmission, and the handbrake. The whole center console design resembles a copperhead snake.

5000|$|The game also {{ships with}} a unique drum controller, the AirStrike, that allows the player to {{interact}} with the game without contact, similar to air guitaring, making for a quieter playing experience. The crescent-shaped unit, with four sensors and a bass-drum kick pedal along with additional <b>console</b> <b>control</b> buttons, is used by placing it {{on the floor in front}} of the player. The unit senses the movements in the general areas where the sensors are located, simulating the position of drums, and is able to distinguish movement between the individual drum sticks. The unit also includes support legs to bring the sensors closer to the player to help improve movement detection. Bernard Chiu, CEO of Seven45 Studios, noted that they expected people to be skeptical of the controller, but believes the unit provides a [...] "much more real and authentic" [...] experience compared to other drum kits available.|$|E

5000|$|An {{unrelated}} {{and separate}} spin-off system called the V.Smile Baby Infant Development System was released {{shortly after the}} original V.Smile {{was introduced to the}} market. The games and cartridges of a V.Smile Baby are not compatible with a V.Smile and vice versa. This is an important distinction since so many of the other consoles named [...] "V.Smile" [...] are intercompatible. The control system for the Infant Development System is significantly different from those used in the V.Smile that is targeted at older children: it does not have the features of a typical game controller, instead the design is more like that of a playboard. The controls consist of a mode slider, two switches (one for power and the other toggles the board between standalone play mode and <b>console</b> <b>control</b> mode), 7 buttons (5 shape buttons, a [...] "fun" [...] button, a small Exit button), and a roller ball hooked up to a sensor. The controller itself has a speaker which comes into play during standalone mode (in which it functions as a playboard that play music, speech and sound when interacted with). The controller communicates with the console by means of infra-red signaling. The console itself is rather unusual in design, having only an on-off switch and permanently attached cables carrying composite video signal and monaural audio through two RCA connectors. It runs off four AA batteries or a 6V DC power supply (sold separately). The console has a cartridge slot as well as indents to hold four additional cartridges for storage. Also, powering off the controller will also power off the console if the console is switched on at the time. Designed for kids ages 9-36 months.|$|E
30|$|The {{authors of}} this paper studied the reports of 20 {{experience}} design cases that were conducted in collaboration with masters-level design students and seven companies in the metal and engineering industry from 2012 to 2015. The given design briefs from the different companies share the same high-level goal to design for meaningful experience at work in heavy industry. The differences among the 20 assignments lie in the design contexts varying from heavy machine operation (e.g., crane remote control, tugboat <b>console,</b> <b>control</b> room of automation system) to the peripheral touchpoints for different stakeholders involved in the industrial system (e.g., a mobile application for factory automation customers, a mobile sales application for ship components, a mobile crane monitoring application).|$|E
