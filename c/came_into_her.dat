25|$|While {{still married}} to Henri, Swanson {{had an affair}} with the married Joseph P. Kennedy, father of future President John F. Kennedy, for a number of years. He became her {{business}} partner and their relationship was an open secret in Hollywood. He took over all of her personal and business affairs and was supposed to make her millions. Unfortunately, Kennedy left her after the disastrous Queen Kelly and her finances were in worse shape than when he <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> life. Two books have been written about the affair.|$|E
25|$|As {{this was}} happening, Karl Wilhelm Naundorff <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> life, {{pretending to be}} the now adult Louis XVII. For over a year, he lived at her home as she {{questioned}} him at length, testing him with old keepsakes. She also verified his birthmarks which seemed identical to those she noted on the young Dauphin {{at the request of}} Marie Antoinette. She fought a long battle to attest to his rights, enduring searches of her home where police seized a number of documents, files, and even presents presented to her from the Royal family.|$|E
500|$|Despite her avid {{consumption}} of books, however, Emmeline {{was not given}} the educational advantages enjoyed by her brothers. Their parents believed that the girls needed most to learn the art of [...] "making home attractive" [...] and other skills desired by potential husbands. The Gouldens deliberated carefully about future plans for their sons' education, but they expected their daughters to marry young and avoid paid work. Although they supported women's suffrage and the general advancement of women in society, the Gouldens believed their daughters incapable {{of the goals of}} their male peers. Feigning sleep one evening as her father <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> bedroom, Emmeline Goulden heard him pause and say to himself: [...] "What a pity she wasn't born a lad." ...|$|E

500|$|King Francis set his daughter-in-law {{an example}} of kingship and artistic {{patronage}} that she never forgot. She witnessed his huge architectural schemes at Chambord and Fontainebleau. She saw Italian and French craftsmen at work together, forging the style that {{became known as the}} first School of Fontainebleau. Francis died in 1547, and Catherine became queen consort of France. But it wasn't until her husband King Henry's death in 1559, when she found herself at forty the effective ruler of France, that Catherine <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own as a patron of architecture. Over the next three decades, she launched a series of costly building projects aimed at enhancing the grandeur of the monarchy. During the same period, however, religious civil war gripped the country and brought the prestige of the monarchy to a dangerously low ebb.|$|E
500|$|Sue Ellen's storylines in {{the first}} season focus on the character's bout with alcohol and her slowly deteriorating {{relationship}} with her husband. The final episode of the season focused on {{the birth of her}} son with J.R., John Ross Ewing III. While her relationship with J.R. is not always harmonious, it's a significant aspect of her overall character. As the series progressed, Sue Ellen <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own as an individual character. The actress has said of her character's personality: [...] "I never wanted her to be boring. She was never boring before – she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting." [...] Gray later described Sue Ellen as being, [...] "one of the most interesting characters on TV in the 1980s. She was the original Desperate Housewife. She led the way for all those girls." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1950s saw Hepburn take on {{a series}} of {{professional}} challenges, and stretch herself further than at any other point in her life at an age when most other actresses began to retreat. Berg describes the decade as [...] "the heart of her vast legacy" [...] and [...] "the period in which she truly <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own." [...] In January 1950, Hepburn ventured into Shakespeare, playing Rosalind in As You Like It. She hoped to prove that she could play already established material, and said, [...] "It's better to try something difficult and flop than to play it safe all the time." [...] It opened at the Cort Theatre in New York to a capacity audience, and was virtually sold out for 148 shows. The production then went on tour. Reviews for Hepburn varied, but she was noted as the only leading-lady in Hollywood who was performing high-caliber material onstage.|$|E

500|$|One day, whilst {{working on}} On the 6, Jennifer Lopez [...] "happened to be" [...] {{recording}} {{at the same}} recording studio where American recording artist Marc Anthony was recording. Anthony, who had become intrigued by Lopez after seeing her in Selena (1997), <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> studio {{and asked her to}} appear in the music video for his song [...] "No Me Conoces". She agreed, but only if he recorded a song with her, to which he in turn agreed. Lopez recalled the events on her [...] video album by stating: [...] "So at that time I called Tommy [...] and I'm like 'Look, so Marc Anthony said he would do a song and I really don't want to do a duet with just anybody, I want to do a duet with him. So can you force him to sign something, so he has to do a record with me? If I do this video!'". The two first shot the video and then began working on the song.|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} of the Plain 4 pieces was revealed in 1869, when one was reproduced in the American Journal of Numismatics. The significance {{and history of the}} pieces was at first unrecognized, and the revelation prompted no particular excitement. How the pieces returned to US authorities came to be dispersed is unknown. The set given to the King of Siam was sold at auction by descendants of Anna Leonowens, who served as schoolteacher to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the 1860s, although how it <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> possession is uncertain. Today, three of the pieces are in private collections, the fourth is in the Harry W. Bass, Jr. Collection, displayed in the Money Museum of the American Numismatic Association in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Siam set sold most recently for $8.5 million. [...] From his experience of many years as a coin dealer, Albanese believes that the eagle in that set is not the original, but another of the four 1804 Plain 4 eagles, purchased to replace one sold to a collector.|$|E

2500|$|By the {{conclusion}} of the election cycle in November 2008, Clinton's campaign was severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13 million that she lent it herself. [...] She continued to raise funds, but then her January 2009 confirmation as U.S. Secretary of State prevented her from doing any political fundraising herself. [...] During the first quarter of 2009, a surprisingly large $5.6 million <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> campaign, enabling her to pay off all creditors other than her pollster Mark Penn, to whom the campaign still owed $2.3 million.|$|E

I went away because I saw that she refrained from crying out on my account. I thought {{she was in a}} bad way. A consultation was held by her three physicians, the result of which was that they determined to bleed her in the feet. They had some difficulty in persuading her to submit to it, because the pain in her feet was so great that she uttered the most piercing screams if the bedclothes only rubbed against them. The bleeding, however, succeeded, and she was in some degree relieved. It was the gout in both feet ...|$|E

2500|$|Torv's {{double duty}} as Olivia and Fauxlivia {{late in the}} second season and {{throughout}} {{the third and fourth}} seasons received almost universal critical acclaim. TV Guide called it one of the best performances of the year, explaining [...] "Switching Olivia with her alternate-universe self... jump-started the show's interpersonal dynamics — and changed the way we look at Torv. Her take on [...] added many new colors to the characters, including malice, humor and sensuality. In a 2010 list, Time Magazines James Poniewozik called Torv's performance one of television's best of the year. He explained, [...] "... in the dual role of Olivia/Fauxlivia, Torv absolutely <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own this year. While some credit goes to the writing, it was Torv's shaded performance that sold Olivia's alternate-universe twin as an actual separate person—not just a cartoon villain version of the original, but a real person, a little more assertive and confident, and just a touch rapacious. Meanwhile, she convincingly portrayed the trauma and confusion of her captured-then-returned Olivia, whose emotional (and complicated) reunion with Peter made an outlandish situation real and moving." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{optional}} exercises Davydova <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own, outscoring all her teammates and meriting a 10 on floor. Barbara Slater, {{who had been}} a British gymnast in Montreal and was a TV commentator in 1980, described Davydova's floor exercise as the [...] "performance of the Olympics." [...] Nik Stuart, 9 times British AA champion and the first British national coach, stated that [...] "Her floor exercise is the most complex ever designed for a female gymnast, full of difficulty and fluidity." [...] US gymnast Karen Le Mond stated that Davydova's FX had [...] "harder tumbling passes than the best 10 has ever had." [...] Another commentator wrote [...] "No gymnast of either sex has ever attempted so complicated or complex a routine." [...] The FIG website praises her [...] "delightful dance movements." [...] Glenn Sundby, editor of International Gymnast magazine, commented that [...] "Davydova would have won anywhere on this earth with that floor routine." [...] This routine is also praised in Michael Murphy's 1992 book [...] "The Future of The Body". This was only the second time a perfect score of 10 had been scored on fx at an Olympics; it was the 1st ever 10 scored in team optionals fx and the only 10 scored on fx – in either women's or men's gymnastics – at the 1980 Olympics.|$|E

Jay Sebring remained one of the couple's most frequent companions. Polanski's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in Poland such as Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski's girlfriend, coffee heiress Abigail Folger. Tate and Polanski moved into the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles for a few months [...] until they arranged to lease Patty Duke's home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968. The Polanski house was often full of strangers, and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the [...] "free spirit" [...] of the times, saying that she did not mind who <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> home as her motto was [...] "live and let live". Her close friend Leslie Caron later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting — [...] "to the point of recklessness" [...] — and that she had been alarmed by it.|$|E
