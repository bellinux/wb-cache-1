5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} may not develop at all, {{or may be}} fused in the midline behind the aorta. These are {{associated}} with other <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> such as failure of the kidneys to develop, or fused kidneys. The gland may develop with a partial or complete absence of the cortex, or may develop in an unusual location.|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{alprazolam}} {{during pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> and use in the last trimester may cause fetal drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms in the post-natal period as well as neonatal flaccidity and respiratory problems. However, in long-term users of benzodiazepines, abrupt discontinuation due to concerns of teratogenesis has {{a high risk of}} causing extreme withdrawal symptoms and a severe rebound effect of the underlying mental health disorder. Spontaneous abortions may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines.|$|E

5|$|Warfarin {{administration}} {{in the second and}} third trimesters is much less commonly associated with birth defects, and when they do occur, are considerably different from fetal warfarin syndrome. The most common <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities</b> associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy are central nervous system disorders, including spasticity and seizures, and eye defects. Because of such later pregnancy birth defects, anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications, such as stroke prevention in those with artificial heart valves.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin is {{contraindicated}} in pregnancy, as {{it passes}} through the placental barrier and may cause bleeding in the fetus; warfarin use during pregnancy is commonly associated with spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, and preterm birth. Coumarins (such as warfarin) are also teratogens, that is, they cause birth defects; the incidence of birth defects in infants exposed to warfarin in utero appears to be around 5%, although higher figures (up to 30%) {{have been reported in}} some studies. Depending on when exposure occurs during pregnancy, two distinct combinations of <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities</b> can arise.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{is known}} to hybridise with the black wildebeest. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation, however it may occur when both species are confined within the same area, and the offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities</b> relating to their teeth, horns and the Wormian bones of the skull. Another study reported {{an increase in the}} size of the hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some hybrid animals the auditory bullae are highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E

5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities</b> of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E

25|$|A bifid sternum is an {{extremely}} rare <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormality</b> caused by the fusion failure of the sternum. This condition results in sternal cleft which can be observed at birth without any symptom.|$|R
40|$|Thyroid hemiagenesis is an {{extremely}} rare <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormality</b> of the thyroid gland, char-acterized {{by the absence of}} one lobe. The true prevalence of this <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormality</b> is un-certain, because the absence of one thyroid lobe usually does not cause clinical symptoms by itself. However, several studies showed that the prevalence of this anomaly was estimated as 0. 05 - 0. 2 %. Thyroid hemiagenesis is more frequently found in women, and in the left lobe. Commonly found in the remaining lobe are benign adenoma, a multinodular goiter, hyperthy-roidism, chronic thyroiditis, and rarely carcinoma. We report a case of 53 -year-old woma...|$|R
40|$|Anomalous {{origin of}} the left {{coronary}} artery from the pulmonary artery is a rare <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormality</b> but with a very poor prognosis at birth.

50|$|A {{tracheoesophageal fistula}} (TEF, or TOF; see {{spelling}} differences) is an abnormal connection (fistula) between the esophagus and the trachea.

25|$|Parasitic infection, {{especially}} with threadworms (Strongyloides westeri) and ascarids (Parascaris equorum) can produce signs of colic in foals (See Ascarids). Other conditions {{that may lead}} to signs of colic in foals include <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> gastric ulcers (see Gastric ulceration), which may lead to gastric perforation and peritonitis, small intestine volvulus, and uroabdomen secondary to urinary bladder rupture.|$|E
25|$|Reconstructive {{plastic surgery}} is {{performed}} to correct functional impairments caused by burns; traumatic injuries, such as facial bone fractures and breaks; <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> such as cleft palates or cleft lips; developmental abnormalities; infection and disease; and cancer or tumors. Reconstructive plastic surgery is usually performed to improve function, {{but it may}} be done to approximate a normal appearance.|$|E
25|$|A {{surgical}} {{approach is}} necessary in cases where a breakthrough infection results despite prophylaxis, or there is non-compliance with the prophylaxis. Similarly if the VUR is severe (Grade IV & V), there are pyelonephritic changes or <b>congenital</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Other reasons necessitating surgical intervention are failure of renal growth, formation of new scars, renal deterioration and VUR in girls approaching puberty.|$|E
