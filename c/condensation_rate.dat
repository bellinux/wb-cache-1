40|$|Condensation {{of water}} from warm, humid air to cold rock walls in caves is {{regarded}} to {{play a significant role}} in speleogenesis. The water condensing to the cave walls quickly attains equilibrium with the carbon dioxide in the surrounding air, and consequently dissolves limestone or gypsum forming various types of macro-,meso-, and micromorphologies. In this paper we present the basic physical principles of condensation and give equations, which allow a satisfactory estimation of <b>condensation</b> <b>rates.</b> Water condensing to a cooler wall releases heat of condensation, which raises the temperature of the wall thus reducing the temperature difference ΔT between the warm air and the cave wall. Furthermore one has to take into account the heat flux from the air to the cave wall. This defines the boundary conditions for the equation of heat conduction. For a constant temperature of the air initial <b>condensation</b> <b>rates</b> are high but then drop down rapidly by orders of magnitude during the first few days. Finally constant <b>condensation</b> <b>rates</b> are attained, when the heat flux into the rock is fully transmitted to the surface of the karst plateau. For spherical and cylindrical conduits these can be obtained as a function of the depth Z below the surface. When diurnal or seasonal variations of the air temperature are active as is the case close to cave entrances, <b>condensation</b> <b>rates</b> can become quite significant, up to about 10 - 6 m/year. The theoretical results are applied also to corrosion of speleothems and the formation of »röhrenkarren« as described by Simms (2003). To convert <b>condensation</b> <b>rates</b> into retreat of bedrock the saturation state of the solution must be known. In the appendix we present experiments, which prove that in any case the solution flowing off the rock is saturated with respect to limestone or gypsum, respectively...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we report}} the {{synthesis}} of methylene-bridged periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) of the SBA- 15 type. The materials were characterized by SAXS, BET, NMR, FESEM, and TEM. It was found that {{the synthesis of}} methylene-bridged SBA- 15 PMOs requires more rigorous conditions than that of SBA- 15 PMOs bearing organic bridges other than methylene. A mild acidic environment, which slows down the hydrolysis and <b>condensation</b> <b>rates</b> of the precursor, with the assistance of a salt, which enhances precursor−template interaction, should be used to synthesize high-quality large-pore methylene-bridged PMOs. We attributed this to the fast hydrolysis and <b>condensation</b> <b>rates</b> and the rigid backbone of precursor 1, 2 -bis(triethoxysilyl) methylene. By examining and comparing the synthesis of three large-pore PMOs with different bridges, we concluded that the inductive, bridging, and conformation effects of the organic bridging group {{play an important role in}} the synthesis of large-pore PMO materials...|$|R
50|$|The vapour {{pressure}} over the hot liquid working fluid at the hot {{end of the}} pipe is higher than the equilibrium {{vapour pressure}} over the condensing working fluid at the cooler end of the pipe, and this pressure difference drives a rapid mass transfer to the condensing end where the excess vapour condenses, releases its latent heat, and warms the cool end of the pipe. Non-condensing gases (caused by contamination for instance) in the vapour impede the gas flow and reduce the effectiveness of the heat pipe, particularly at low temperatures, where vapour pressures are low. The speed of molecules in a gas is approximately the speed of sound, {{and in the absence of}} noncondensing gases (i.e., if there is only a gas phase present) this is the upper limit to the velocity with which they could travel in the heat pipe. In practice, the speed of the vapour through the heat pipe is limited by the rate of condensation at the cold end and far lower than the molecular speed. Note/explanation: The <b>condensation</b> <b>rate</b> is very close to the sticking coefficient times the molecular speed times the gas density, if the condensing surface is very cold. However, if the surface is close to the temperature of the gas, the evaporation caused by the finite temperature of the surface largely cancels this heat flux. If the temperature difference is more than some tens of degrees, the evaporation from the surface is typically negligible, as can be assessed from the vapour pressure curves. In most cases, with very efficient heat transport through the gas, it is very challenging to maintain such significant temperature differences between the gas and the condensing surface. Moreover, this temperature differences of course corresponds to a large effective thermal resistance by itself. The bottleneck is often less severe at the heat source, as the gas densities are higher there, corresponding to higher maximum heat fluxes.|$|E

The liquid motion beneath the liquid-vapor interface is induced by an axisymmetric laminar jet of subcooled liquid.

However, the effect of buoyancy on the <b>condensation</b> <b>rate</b> cannot be quantified in terms of the Richardson number alone.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{was developed for}} estimating the <b>condensation</b> <b>rates</b> of convective storms using satellite measurements of cirrus anvil expansion rates and radiosonde measurements of environmental water vapor. Three cases of severe convection in Oklahoma were studied and a diagnostic model was developed for integrating radiosonde data with satellite data. Two methods were {{used to measure the}} anvil expansion rates - the expansion of isotherm contours on infrared images, and the divergent motions of small brightness anomalies tracked on the visible images. The differences between the two methods were large as the storms developed, but these differences became small in the latter stage of all three storms. A comparison between the three storms indicated that the available moisture in the lowest levels greatly affected the rain rates of the storms.

While the bin scheme does not always predict a cloud droplet size distribution that is well represented by a gamma distribution function (which is assumed by bulk schemes), this fact appears to be of secondary importance for explaining why the two schemes predict different <b>condensation</b> and evaporation <b>rates.</b> The width of the cloud droplet size is not well constrained by observations, and thus {{it is difficult to know}} how to appropriately specify it in bulk microphysics schemes.

The tank was nearly cylindrical, having a volume of about 0. 144 cu m with 0. 559 m in diameter and 0. 711 m length. A mixer/pump unit, which had a jet nozzle outlet of 0. 0221 m in diameter was located 0. 178 m from the tank bottom and was installed inside the tank to generate the axial jet mixing and tank fluid circulation.

40|$|The {{transport}} of a condensing passive scalar is studied as a prototype {{model for the}} kinematics of moisture transport on isentropic surfaces. Condensation occurs whenever the scalar concentration exceeds a specified local saturation value. Since condensation rates are strongly nonlinear functions of moisture content, the mean moisture flux is generally not diffusive. To relate the mean moisture content, mean <b>condensation</b> <b>rate,</b> and mean moisture flux to statistics of the advecting velocity field, a one-dimensional stochastic model is developed in which the Lagrangian velocities of air parcels are independent Ornstein– Uhlenbeck (Gaussian colored noise) processes. The mean moisture evolution equation for the stochastic model is derived in the Brownian and ballistic limits of small and large Lagrangian velocity correlation time. The evolution equation involves expressions for the mean moisture flux and mean <b>condensation</b> <b>rate</b> that are nonlocal but remarkably simple. In a series of simulations of homogeneous two-dimensional turbulence, the dependence of mean moisture flux and mean <b>condensation</b> <b>rate</b> on mean saturation deficit is shown to be reproducible by the one-dimensional stochastic model, provided eddy length and time scales are taken as given. For nonzero Lagrangian velocity correlation times, condensation reduces the mean moisture flux for a given mean moisture gradient compared with the mean flux of a noncondensing scalar. 1...|$|E
