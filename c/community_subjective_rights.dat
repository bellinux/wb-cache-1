40|$|The {{appearance}} of Internet {{has brought a}} substantial debate about the validity ofthe legal theory to explain his regulation. In this context, the concept of <b>subjective</b> <b>right</b> is one ofthe most controversial.

Notwithstanding these thesis are debatable. <b>Subjective</b> <b>right</b> can be conceived in a more flexible form. Furthermore, Internet is not so different: it is not an independent world in need of a new law. From these premises, we can argue that the diversity of rights typical ofthe legal orders appears in Internet too.

40|$|Regulating the {{administrative}} contentious represents {{the expression of}} the particular concern of the society to strengthen the legal protection of all individuals when it is in the position to “confront” a public authority. This paper examines, briefly, one of the special conditions of direct action in {{the administrative}} contentious, that is the condition referring to invoking by the claimant of its harm in a <b>subjective</b> <b>right</b> or in a legitimate interest. In this respect, the research of the two concepts - <b>subjective</b> <b>right</b> and legitimate interest - will have a starting point the presentation of various opinions from specialists in other branches of law, such as general theory of law and civil law. Based on analysis, observation and case study, benefiting from a rich and diverse literature, we highlighted the changes that have intervened in the Romanian law, which determined that the legitimate interests would be placed on equal footing with individual rights, especially since the jurisprudence tends to focus on the harm of the person and less on whether the damage was brought to its <b>subjective</b> <b>right</b> or legitimate interest...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{question}} whether civil-law protection of personar interests (Art. 23 and 24 of the Civil Code) is based on the <b>subjective</b> <b>right</b> conception. The author presents his standpoint with respect to the following controversies concerning various aspects of personal interests protection. First, he rejects the view that the immanent link between the person and his/her personal interests, i. e. the inseparability of a subject and an object of a right makes it impossible to adopt the construction of a <b>subjective</b> <b>right.</b> The author proves first that the notion of an object of a right is not a necessary element of a <b>subjective</b> <b>right</b> and that the essence of a <b>subjective</b> <b>right</b> lies in its regulative functions with respect to behaviours of others and not in delimiting the sphere of exclusiveness for a subject with respect to a separate object. Besides, the author proves also {{that in the case of}} personal interests the inseparatedness of a subject and an object does not actually take place because there are numerous individual attributes of human personality which do not come within the notion of legal capacity and thus require separate civil-law protection. Next, the author declares for an objective (intersubjective) conception of personal interests and for the conception of plurality of personal rights. The author then states that although there must always be a statutory basis for creating „erga omnes" rights, the degree of precision of the statutory formulation of those rights may vary and thus it is possible to construe „erga omnes" rights protecting interests which — though not mentioned in Art. 23 of the Civil Code — are nonetheless accepted in some way by the legal system. As to the presumption of unlawfulness of the infringement of a personal interest, the author states that each such infringement should be qualified as the infringement of a personal right, and that the criteria of evaluating the unlawfulness are to be of objective character, i. e. are to be based on normative grounds and subsidiarily on the grounds of principles of social coexistence. Similar criteria should be applied to the evaluation of conflicting interests. A generally accepted view that a prevailing social or individual interest may eliminate the unlawfulness does not in any way weaken the construction of a <b>subjective</b> <b>right</b> as a means of protecting personal interests. In turn, a view that a consent of an entitled person is a circumstance eliminating the unlawfulness of an infringement is fully in agreement with the conception of a <b>subjective</b> <b>right.</b> Namely, a consent is an expression of the freedom of decision with respect to one's own interests, and as such is the way of executing one's own <b>subjective</b> <b>rights.</b> Finally, the author analyses other constructions which might be used for the protection of human interests. In particular, he comments on „legal reflexes", tort liability, and the so-called „institutional protection". Neither of them meets the standards offered by the <b>subjective</b> <b>right</b> conception. The first does not stress adequately the fact that general duties originate in the individual interest of the entitled person, the second is based on guilt as one of the premisses of protection, and the third — being centered on the protection of supra-individual interests indicated in „the institution" — would be drastically in conflict with the very sense of introducing the protection regulated in Art. 24 of the Civil Code, aimed at safeguarding individual and not supra-individual interests.

40|$|In {{the study}} of medieval {{political}} philosophy the tendency has been {{to pay attention to}} thinkers who appear to have contributed to the birth of the modem. While the value in coming to understand how modem political thought developed is undeniable, this tendency is accompanied by an implicit, perhaps unintentional, devaluation of {{the study of}} that which did not contribute as obviously to modernity. In the history of the idea of the natural right scholars have distinguished between the objective and the <b>subjective</b> <b>right,</b> characterizing the <b>subjective</b> <b>right</b> as what {{lies at the heart of}} the classically modem and liberal. One could get the impression that the good political philosophers, having hit upon the <b>subjective</b> <b>right,</b> dispensed with talk of the old-fashioned objective right just as people abandoned gaslight when Edison 2 ̆ 7 s light bulb went on the market. But this is not what happened; not only did objective rights discourse continue into the modem period, but it was not necessarily the idiom solely of religious and political conservatives. Some late medieval philosophers, notably Marsilius of Padua, even came up with progressive and unorthodox political visions while adhering to the objective right. I will show that at least one late medieval political theory founded on the objective right, that of John Wyclif, can be argued to be as innovative in several important aspects as that of any of the better-known fourteenth-century advocates of the <b>subjective</b> <b>right.</b> To do that, I will divide this paper into three parts. In the first, I will explain the difference between objective and subjective theories of the right, making note of what we can reasonably expect from a fourteenth-century political theory in the way of toleration and briefly introducing John Wyclifs life and works. In the second I will recount Wyclifs view of ius, or the right, as it appears in his political writings, and in the third I will explain how this concept has a bearing on elements in his political thought that are recognizably unorthodox and even tolerant to modem, liberal eyes. Having shown how Wyclif 2 ̆ 7 s objective right plays out in his innovative and reformative political scheme, I hope to have helped to dispel the dogma that the only early rights theories worth studying are those that evolved into ones we use...|$|R

40|$|Luis de Molina (1535 - 1600) grants slaves a {{legal status}} {{through which they}} can take up a {{position}} {{with respect to their}} masters between equivalent legal entity and legal object. Here, what is decisive is the figure of the <b>subjective</b> <b>right,</b> which both for Molina and modern proponents of this legal concept describes the 'right per se'. According to Molina's definition of ius, the denial of a <b>subjective</b> <b>right</b> or the hindrance of exercising an individual right represents an injustice. The rights granted to a slave in virtue of his being regarded a human being (despite the condition of slavery) serve to protect the slave against unjust acts. Molina does not distinguish the slave as a legal entity as separate from his master insofar as the slave should be protected against injustices committed against him or his property; injustices for which he would be entitled to compensation. Yet, the slave is not able to stake his claim to a particular right because it is not possible for him to take the matter to court. His natural law justified coequal legal status with respect to his master is limited in such a way by the positive legal order (by means of which slavery is generally made possible) that he is to be held legally incompetent as a legal entity with regard to defending and enforcing his 'qua homo'-legal rights. This precarious situation is due to the complicated legal intermediate position of a human legal entity, which, at the same time, represents the legal object of another person...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{changes in}} the {{sovereignty}} plane are caused also by technologic, economic or strategic modifications affecting today's international society. These changes are accompanied by a reassessment of the protection of <b>subjective</b> fundamental <b>rights</b> (also called human rights) and of sovereignty as value, fact that is unconditionally accepted but many a time contested {{from the perspective of}} the effectiveness of these rights and of sovereignty itself. It is important to understand two aspects: first, the way in which positive law (positivism and its exclusively normative analysis) may cover causes”that are external to the legal system sometimes leading to an almost absolute inefficiency of fundamental rights”. The second aspect regards the need for an inter-disciplinary approach (legal, political, economic) that may lead to a better understanding of the concrete causes and the phenomenon of inefficiency of these rights. In any field of human activity there are preoccupations regarding the dysfunctionalities that may occur inside it also and consequently one studies the causes, manner of occurrence, their manifestations and consequences. In the domain of guarantee of <b>subjective</b> <b>rights</b> – a legal domain par excellence, but with multiple implications in the other fields of the social sphere – this is much more obvious...|$|R
