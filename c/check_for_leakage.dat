The parallel-plate flow chamber technique has been extensively used to measure platelet adhesion and activation in vitro at arterial or venous flow conditions. However, current tests use collagen as the only platelet-adhesive surface, thereby disregarding the contribution of other platelet-adhesive components in the vascular matrix. This is a relevant issue, since multiple platelet adhesive receptors need to interact and signal to form a stable platelet thrombus. On type I collagen fibers, the two collagen receptors, glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and integrin α 2 β 1 (GPIa/IIa) interact with the receptors for von Willebrand factor (vWF), a plasma protein that avidly binds to collagen, i. e. GPIb-V-IX and integrin αIIbβ 3 (GPIIb/IIIa). (6 - 8) It is hence relevant to compare the roles of these receptors with other ones, such as CLEC- 2, CD 36 (GPIV), and the integrins α 5 β 1, α 6 β 1 and αvβ 3. In the accompanying paper, we have described a microspot technology, in which various platelet-adhesive compounds can be coated simultaneously in a flow chamber, and directly compared for their potential to support thrombus formation using small blood samples. (9) When forming a thrombus, platelets show different types of responses, all of which may contribute to effective hemostasis and pathological thrombosis. These include shape change (pseudopod and lamellipod formation), integrin activation, secretion of the contents of dense granules and α-granules (P-selectin exposure), and actin-dependent contraction of the formed thrombus. (1, 5) In addition, a subpopulation of the platelets – with high cytosolic Ca 2 + – assumes a balloon-type of morphology and exposes the procoagulant phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) at their outer surface, at which coagulation factors bind and thrombin can be formed. (10) Since it is unclear how these different platelet responses relate during thrombus formation, we developed procedures to measure these in a systematic way in combination with the microspot technology. (9) In this protocol paper, we describe the use of brightfield and confocal fluorescence microscopy to record the various platelet activation processes contributing to thrombus formation; and we give procedures to analyze the acquired microscopic images. We note that all assays are performed in the absence of coagulation. Furthermore, we stress that: due to space restrictions not all details could be given; specific procedures may need adaptation in different laboratories; and that expert knowledge will be required for successful completion of the flow assays. We welcome comments on errors and suggestions for improvement. Content: - A. Flow chamber preparation and whole blood perfusion. - B. Brightfield and fluorescence microscopic imaging of thrombi. - C.

The Maastricht chamber has been described before. It needs to be fixed in an aluminium holder with screws. 4 - Silicon tubing (0. 28 mm ID, 0. 61 mm OD; Rubber BV Hilversum). - Blunt syringe needles (18 gauge) to connect with tubing. - Surgical tweezers to clamp tubing. - Pulse-free syringe perfusion pump Type 100 (Harvard Instruments). - Needle or system for blood drawing (e. g., 23 gauge). - Plastic syringes 1 mL (Becton-Dickinson). - 5 mL polystyrene tube (Greiner Bio-One). ### Procedure **Procedures A. Flow chamber preparation and whole blood perfusion** **A 1. Preparation of coverslips** *CRITICAL. Wash cleaned coverslips thoroughly with water*. - 1. Degrease new coverslips (use tweezers) with 2 M HCl in 50 % ethanol. - 2. Wash coverslips twice with milliQ water to remove residual HCl. - 3. Leave coverslips to dry on drying rack. **A 2. Coating of coverslips** *CRITICAL. Prevent drying of biological material on coverslip by storing in humid environment*. - 4. Prepare coating material (collagen, collagen peptide, decorin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, laminin, osteopontin, rhodocytin, thrombospondin, vitronectin, vWF), at 50 - 250 μg/mL, as described. (9) - 5. Mount coverslip onto precision mall for coating. - 6. Apply 0. 5 µL of coating solution(s) in the assigned place(s), and remove from the mall. - 7. Store coverslip in humid environment to prevent drying out of microspots. Allow coating material to bind for 60 minutes at room temperature. - 8. Block uncoated glass with blocking buffer, and leave in humid environment for 30 minutes. - 9. Wash blocked coverslip with saline. If not immediately used, leave coverslip in humid environment to prevent drying. **A 3. Assembly of coverslip and flow chamber** *CRITICAL. <b>Check</b> <b>for</b> <b>leakage</b> of the mounted flow chamber. Also check rigorously for absence of air bubbles before starting the experiment. Note that temperature changes can lead to appearance of air bubbles. Keep inlet tubing as short as possible* - 10. Connect tubing to inlet and outlet of the flow chamber. - 11. Rinse chamber and tubing with flow buffer, check for absence of air bubbles, and mount coated coverslip on top of chamber. - 12. Place chamber with coverslip in aluminium holder and tighten screws. - 13. Check that flow chamber system is leak-tight by perfusion with flow buffer, flush out any bubbles in chamber. **A 4. Drawing of human blood by venipuncture** *CRITICAL: Before drawing human blood, obtain permission from your Medical Ethical Committee, according to the local and national regulations, and get full informed consent from donor. Coagulation (traces of thrombin) need to be rigorously prevented by drawing without constraints, mixing well with anticoagulant, and incubation at 37 oC. Note that PPACK is only shortly active as an anticoagulant at neutral pH. Other possible errors are described elsewhere. (4) * - 14. Add 0. 5 mL saline into a 5 mL polystyrene blood collection tube. Add 40 U/mL (f. c.) fragmin, and add 40 µM PPACK (f. c.) just before venipuncture. - 15. Draw blood according to local protocols, and let smoothly flow into collection tube. Directly mix blood with anticoagulant solution. We prefer an open system using a 23 gauge needle, to ensure undisturbed flow. Discard first 1 mL of blood before filling blood collection tube. - 16. Incubate the collected blood at 37 °C for 10 - 15 minutes to allow platelets to resensitize. - 17. Preferably, determine platelet and red cell counts. A decrease in platelet count points to aggregation of platelets, e. g. by traces of thrombin. - 18. Add additional 20 µM PPACK (f. c.) once per hour. **A 5. Blood perfusion through flow chamber** *CRITICAL: Check for correct pump settings to obtain the requested shear rate. Check for absence of air bubbles and fibrin clots during the experiment. Preferably use an inverted microscope. Several possible errors are described elsewhere. (4) * - 19. Only for experiments to determine stable platelet adhesion or thrombus volume, add 0. 5 µg/mL DiOC 6 (f. c.) to 0. 5 mL blood sample. Allow staining of the blood cells for 5 minutes. - 20. Draw 0. 5 mL blood sample into 1 mL syringe equipped with blunt needle. Make sure that no air is present in top of needle. - 21. Connect syringe with blood sample to inlet tubing of prepared flow chamber. Carefully avoid air bubbles (fluid-fluid contact). - 22. Prepare 1 mL syringe with flow buffer with required fluorescent labels. The following labels are suitable for post-staining: FITC-labeled anti-CD 62 P mAb (1. 25 µg/mL) or FITC-labeled anti-fibrinogen mAb (1 : 100) and/or AF 647 -labeled annexin A 5 (0. 25 µg/mL) (all f. c.). - 23. Mount flow chamber and holder on stage of the microscope, and identify position of microspots with camera. Focus on optical plane of one microspot. - 24. Place syringe filled with whole blood on perfusion pump (push mode). Ensure proper pump settings (arterial wall shear rate: 1600 s^- 1 for 3. 5 minutes or 1000 s^- 1 for 4 minutes; venous wall shear rate 150 s^- 1 for 6 minutes). Note that the wall shear rate depends on the flow rate and the dimensions of the flow chamber. For calculation, see elsewhere. (4) - 25. Switch pump on. The experiment starts when the blood has reached the site of the microspots. **A 6. Recording of stable adhesion and thrombus volume using DiOC 6 -labeled platelets** *CRITICAL: Rinse shortly to prevent disaggregation of thrombi*. - 26. During the first 2 minutes of whole blood perfusion, record DiOC 6 fluorescence microscopic images at 2 -seconds intervals (real-time recording of stable platelet adhesion). - 27. After 3. 5, 4 or 6 minutes of perfusion (depending on shear rate), change syringe with blood by syringe with flow buffer; set pump rate at 1000 s^- 1. - 28. For 2 minutes, rinse chamber with flow buffer. - 29. Take confocal z-stacks from thrombi during stasis; 2 to 3 stacks per microspot (recording of thrombus volume). **A 7. Recording of brightfield images and post-staining with fluorescent labels** *CRITICAL: Rinse shortly to prevent disaggregation of thrombi. Prevent air bubbles in flow chamber during syringe replacements*. - 30. Starting from point 25. - 31. At the end of the whole-blood perfusion, change syringe with blood by syringe with fluorescent labels; set pump rate at 1000 s- 1. - 32. For 2 minutes, perfuse buffer with labels through flow chamber; leave 1 minute for staining. - 33. During the perfusion, take brightfield microscopic images (5 per microspot) under flow. - 34. Change syringe with labels by syringe with flow buffer; and perfuse for 2 minutes to remove unbound label. - 35. Take fluorescence images during stasis (5 images per microspot). **Procedures B.

Since the calorimeter bypass is portable and its data acquisition system autonomous, it can be connected to any test facility to quantify the specific heat capacity of HTFs such as Therminol VP 1, Syltherm 800 and Helisol 5 A at CSP relevant operation conditions. It also enables an examination of the natural aging process of the HTF by periodical measurements of the fluid properties and thereby supports an economic management of CSP plants...|$|R

Purpose: To evaluate the outcome of KP {{as a treatment for}} osteoporotic burst fractures. Overview of Literature: Many surgeons are concerned about the possibility of neurological complications after percutaneous kyphoplasty for osteoporotic burst fractures, secondary to intra-canal cement leakage. Methods: We performed KP as a treatment for osteoporotic burst fractures. We studied 12 patients/ 13 vertebrae. The two control groups consisted of patients who only underwent conservative treatment and those who underwent posterior instrumentation and fusion. We measured each preoperative/postoperative vertebral kyphotic deformity angle (KDA) using simple lateral spine images and <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> <b>leakage</b> of cement, as well. The preoperative/postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores for back pain, degree of daily activity, and postoperative complications were evaluated. Results: The mean improvement in KDA after KP was 9. 7 ± 2. 2 �. The mean preoperative and postoperative VAS scores for back pain were 8. 3 ± 0. 4 and 3. 1 ± 0. 17, respectively. Regarding the control group, the mean postoperative VAS score for the conservative group and the posterior surgery group decreased by 4. 5 ± 0. 17 and 3. 2 ± 0. 19, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the KP and posterior surgery groups (p= 0. 125). However, there was a statistically significant difference between the KP and conservative treatment groups (p= 0. 012). Conclusions: KP is safe and useful for treating osteoporotic burst fractures...|$|R

In this paper, we propose our preliminary results on defining and tackling information aggregation attacks over online {{social networks}}. We first introduce three major threats towards private information in online social networks. We conceptually model private information into multilevel and discretionary models. Then, we articulate information aggregation attacks under discretionary model. Finally, we present our preliminary design of “privacy monitor, ” {{a framework that}} allows users to define their own privacy scheme, and track their actual privacy disclosure to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> any unwanted <b>leakage.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} performance of a synthetic dural sealant {{as an adjunct to}} standard surgical dural repair techniques to prevent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. METHODS: This study was designed as a prospective, nonrandomized, single-center clinical trial. The dural sealant is a synthetic absorbable hydrogel. Consecutive series of patients scheduled for elective cranial and intradural spinal surgery were included until a total of 50 applications were achieved. It was used primarily as an adjunct to ensure watertight dural closure. The end point was defined as no leak with the Valsalva maneuver after dural sealant application. The patients were followed up for 3 months after surgery to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> CSF <b>leakage,</b> standard laboratory and neurological examinations, and possible adverse advents. RESULTS: Of the 49 patients, 46 were included and treated with the dural sealant because of spontaneous leak (n = 34; 69 %) or leak after the Valsalva maneuver (n = 12; 25 %). There was no leak in the other patients (n = 3; 6 %). After application of the dural sealant, there was no leak in all 46 patients (100 %). Of the 46 patients included, there was one case of overt CSF leak. One patient had a pseudomeningocele. There were no adverse events other than those related to the disease or to the surgical procedure itself. CONCLUSION: The dural sealant, a synthetic absorbable hydrogel, is a useful adjunct to achieve watertight dural closure. Application resulted in 100 % closure of intraoperative CSF leaks. There are no evident adverse effects...|$|R

40|$|As {{technology}} scales {{down and}} CMOS circuits are powered by lower supply voltages, standby leakage current becomes significant. A behavioral level {{framework for the}} synthesis of data-paths with low leakage power is presented. There has been minimal work done on the behavioral synthesis of low leakage datapaths. We present a fast architectural simulator <b>for</b> <b>leakage</b> (FASL) to estimate the leakage power dissipated by a system described hierarchically in VHDL. FASL uses a leakage power model embedded into VHDL leafcells. These leafcells are characterized <b>for</b> <b>leakage</b> accurately using HSPICE. We present results which show that FASL measures leakage power significantly faster than HSPICE, {{with less than a}} 5 % loss in accuracy, compared to HSPICE. We present a comprehensive framework <b>for</b> synthesizing low <b>leakage</b> power data-paths using a parameterized Multi-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) component library. The component library has been characterized <b>for</b> <b>leakage</b> power and delay as a function of sleep transistor width. We propose four techniques <b>for</b> minimization of <b>leakage</b> power during behavioral synthesis: (1) leakage power management using MTCMOS modules; (2) an allocation and binding algorithm <b>for</b> low <b>leakage</b> based on clique partitioning; (3) selective binding to MTCMOS technology, allowing the designer to have control over the area overhead; and (4) a performance recovery technique based on multi-cycling and introduction of slack, to alleviate the loss in performance attributed to the introduction of MTCMOS modules in the data-path. Finally, we propose two iterative search based techniques, based on Tabu search, to synthesize low leakage data-paths. The first technique searches <b>for</b> low <b>leakage</b> scheduling options. The second technique simultaneously searches <b>for</b> a low <b>leakage</b> schedule and binding. It is shown that the latter technique of unified search is more robust. The quality of results generated bytabu-based technique are superior to those generated by simulated annealing (SA) search technique...|$|R

To that end, we first conducted a literature review to identify specific pre-requisites <b>for</b> <b>leakage</b> assessment in REDD. We then analyzed a total of 34 quantification methods <b>for</b> <b>leakage</b> emissions from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), the Climate Action Reserve (CAR), the CarbonFix Standard (CFS), and from scientific literature sources. We screened these methods <b>for</b> the <b>leakage</b> aspects they address in terms of leakage type, tools used for quantification and the geographical scale covered. Results show that leakage methods can be grouped into nine main methodological approaches, six of which could fulfill the recommended REDD leakage requirements if approaches for primary and secondary leakage are combined. The majority of methods assessed, address either primary or secondary leakage; the former mostly on a local or regional and the latter on national scale. The VCS {{is found to be}} the only carbon accounting standard at present to fulfill all leakage quantification requisites in REDD.
