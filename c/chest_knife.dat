5000|$|Objects react on {{a clever}} physics based system, {{which was an}} {{innovative}} feature at the time. The system allows objects to be thrown, or to topple if stacked without care. Each object also has a different weight. Another effect {{of this is that}} Puggsy can carry stacks of objects along a flat surface, but a slope will often cause all items except the bottom one (held by Puggsy) to topple and scatter. Also, any objects carried out of the level exits give different score values, {{or in the case of}} the heart object, an extra life. Other objects are extremely varied, including shells, weights, matches, keys, balloons, cups, barrels, clue-giving <b>chests,</b> <b>knives,</b> and candles.|$|R

40|$|Introduction The term complex suicide {{refers to}} suicides in which {{multiple}} suicidal methods are utilized, {{as opposed to}} simple suicide successfully done after one attempt. In planned complex suicides two or more methods are employed simultaneously {{in order to make}} sure that death will occur after failure of previous attempt. In unplanned complex suicides, several other methods of suicide tried after the first chosen method either failed or was too painful. Outline of Cases We report two cases of unplanned complex suicides. The first case was a female who first tried to commit suicide by cutting the wrists, and then hanged herself. In the other case, a male first tried to commit suicide by stubbing his <b>chest</b> with a <b>knife,</b> and then jumped into a well and drowned himself. In both reported cases the second, successful suicidal method was of higher lethality score. Conclusion From the forensic point of view, the presence of several injuries of different origin strongly suggests infliction by other person. The event could be reconstructed, based on autopsy findings and traces found at the scene. ...|$|R

Syn orders Hurok to kill Dogen but Hurok refuses and demands that Dogen be allowed to speak. Dogen tells the nomads that Syn is a liar who wants their land so he can enslave them. The crowd murmurs with anger, but Syn shouts they are all too late. He activates the crystal and summons a blast of energy which stuns the crowd. Syn fires more blasts at Dogen, but he deflects them with the mask. Baal grabs the mask and it shatters on the ground. Hurok seizes Baal and stabs him in the <b>chest</b> with a <b>knife.</b> Syn shouts in despair as his son dies, then suddenly teleports himself away.

5000|$|By {{the start}} of 1943 {{there was a large}} number of Finns in the camp, many of whom were of a sort that was [...] "often homeless, {{semi-literate}} and semi-vagabond." [...] Their section of the camp had become a rough and dangerous place where violence often broke out. This was not helped {{by the fact that they}} would increase the potency of the alcohol allowed to them by adding the likes of hair oil, boot-blacking and wood polish to it. The raucous and dangerous activities of the camp increased around the date of Hitler’s birthday on 20 April, at which point the canteen was looted of all of its alcohol, which only increased the drunkenness and violence. On the morning of 20 April a 26-year-old Finnish man carried a bucket of dirty water from his own house over to the house next door, where he threw it over the face of a man who had been standing there by the entrance to the house. After a moment of shock this 36-year-old man pulled a knife from his pocket and stabbed the younger man in the <b>chest.</b> The <b>knife</b> penetrated the man’s heart and he died moments later having staggered back to fall on the pavement outside his own house. A mob then formed which proceeded to severely beat the older man, but he was able to escape too serious harm because he was able to run out into the protection of the guards when they opened the gates in order to enter to stem the disturbance. In the civil trial that followed, the man was found not guilty of either murder or manslaughter, as it was held that his life was in danger and so the knifing was carried out in self-defence. The man was then returned to the camp.|$|R
50|$|Marcus, Bluey, Kim and Lisa go to {{the master}} {{bedrooms}} where they begin having drug-fuelled sex, watched by Josh who, in the knowledge of all involved, lingers furtively in the darkness, recording the action with a camera. Bluey, who is copulating with Lisa, asks Josh to film the action and then decides to let Josh take a turn. Josh and Lisa then have anal sex. Immediately prior to ejaculation and with Bluey's encouragement, Josh donkey punches Lisa but uses excessive force, breaking her neck and killing her instantly. To cover up the incident, the men decide to throw the body overboard while the women want to report it to the authorities, and argument ensues {{about what to do}} with the tape. Bluey continually insults Tammi and in a fit of rage, she stabs him in the <b>chest</b> with a <b>knife,</b> and the women escape in the yacht's tender.

After {{breaking}} up with her, Braunstein started using the magazine's website as a blog to harass his ex-girlfriend, whom he referred to as [...] "BioHazard". He was charged with 37 counts of harassment, pleaded guilty, {{and was sentenced to}} three years probation. According to the victim, Braunstein harassed her for 18 months, taped her hands to a chair, sent frightening emails and phone messages to her coworkers and family, and posted her naked photos and personal information on an adult web site. On November 22, 2004, Braunstein cut his own <b>chest</b> with a <b>knife</b> and then claimed his ex-girlfriend attacked him. He was taken by the police to Bellevue Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation and released after two hours.Various parsings of these events had him suffering from what could be described as delusions of grandeur and paranoia. He went back to live with his mother in Queens, which earned him the nickname [...] "George Costanza" [...] among his associates. In 2004 he wrote the off-off-broadway play Andy & Edie about the relationship between Andy Warhol and Edie Sedgwick. [...] Although it played to full houses at the relatively small Shetler Studio Theater, the piece wasn't well received by some critics.

5000|$|In The Conquest of New Spain Díaz recounted that, {{after landing}} on the coast, they came across a temple {{dedicated}} to Tezcatlipoca. [...] "That day they had sacrificed two boys, cutting open their chests and offering their blood and hearts to that accursed idol". Díaz narrates several more sacrificial descriptions on the later Cortés expedition. Arriving at Cholula, they find [...] "cages of stout wooden bars … full of men and boys who were being fattened for the sacrifice at which their flesh would be eaten". When the conquistadors reached Tenochtitlan, Díaz described the sacrifices at the Great Pyramid: They strike open the wretched Indian's <b>chest</b> with flint <b>knives</b> and hastily tear out the palpitating heart which, with the blood, they present to the idols …. They cut off the arms, thighs and head, eating the arms and thighs at ceremonial banquets. The head they hang up on a beam, and the body is … given to the beasts of prey. According to Bernal Díaz, the chiefs of the surrounding towns, for example Cempoala, would complain on numerous occasions to Cortés about the perennial need to supply the Aztecs with victims for human sacrifice. It is clear from his description of their fear and resentment toward the Mexicas that, in their opinion, it was no honor to surrender their kinsmen to be sacrificed by them.|$|R

Wesley notes that these demon matches have been revived from the Roman Empire {{and that the}} bracelets kill people if they’re wearing them when they cross the red line. Darin puts the bracelet down and gestures for a guard to drop a knife into the pit. Baker picks the knife up, cutting Angel’s arm with it. Angel morphs into vamp face and the crowd chants, “Killing blow!” Angel defends himself from a few more hits, then stabs Baker in the <b>chest</b> with the <b>knife.</b> Once Baker is dead, the announcer says that Angel has made his first career kill. Angel heads back to join the other demons as Jack announces that it’s time for a match between Trepkos and (expected loser) Mellish. Angel tells Trepkos that if he and Mellish don’t fight, neither of them will die. Cribb tells Angel that he’s not an expert just because he’s made one kill; Angel replies that that wasn’t his first kill. Angel tells Trepkos that they can fight their captors if they stop killing each other. Trepkos instead says that he’ll kill Mellish quickly, a decision which pleases Jack. Once they’re in the ring, Trepkos fulfills his promise. Outside the building, Cordelia tells Wesley {{that they need to}} call the police, but he thinks that Darin will destroy the evidence before anything can happen. Cordelia realizes that he would kill the demons and says that they need to get Angel out, which entails getting his bracelet off. Wesley thinks that, if he can get a bracelet, he’ll be able {{to figure out how to}} forge a magical key to release other bracelets. Cordelia reveals that she swiped a bracelet when he wasn’t looking.|$|R
