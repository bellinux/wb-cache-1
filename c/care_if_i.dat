25|$|During World War II, the U.S. needed greater {{aluminum}} {{supplies to}} build airplanes. Aluminum plants required {{huge amounts of}} electricity. To provide the power, TVA engaged {{in one of the}} largest hydropower construction programs ever undertaken in the U.S. By early in 1942, when the effort reached its peak, 12 hydroelectric plants and one steam plant were under construction at the same time, and design and construction employment reached a total of 28,000. The largest project of this period was the Fontana Dam. After negotiations led by Vice-President Harry Truman ("I want aluminum. I don't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> get it from Alcoa or Al Capone."), TVA purchased the land from Nantahala Power and Light, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcoa, and built Fontana Dam.|$|E
500|$|Carol Swiderski of the Chicago Tribune {{wrote that}} {{although}} saying [...] "have a nice day" [...] {{may not be}} sincere, the speaker has acknowledged that the recipient is there. She argued [...] "ave we become so analytic that we can't accept these little niceties without asking ourselves, 'Did he really mean it? Does she really <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have a nice day?'" [...] Writing that society has become so automated that going through a check-out line at a grocery store without having made eye contact or spoken with the checker is possible, Swiderski favored [...] "insincerely meant human kindness to a robot". She encouraged people to respond to [...] "have a nice day" [...] with [...] "you have a nice day, too" [...] because she hoped that when {{a sufficient number of}} people do this, there could be a time when people will sincerely intend it.|$|E

I sprang at him and struck him with all my force in the face, little <b>caring</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was speared or not. He dropped Tota on the ground.|$|R

500|$|According to The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, {{the most}} {{important}} element of Lichtenstein's procedure in the early 1960s was [...] "the enlargement and unification of his source material". Although, according to some sources, the changes made to produce Drowning Girl are not regarded as significant, Lichtenstein made several notable changes from the original source: [...] "In the original illustration, the drowning girl's boyfriend appears in the background, clinging to a capsized boat. Lichtenstein cropped the image dramatically, showing the girl alone and encircled by a threatening wave. He changed the caption from 'I don't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have a cramp!' to 'I don't care!' and the boyfriend's name from Mal to Brad." [...] With the former narrative change, Lichtenstein removed evidence that the drowning girl has a cramp in her leg. With the latter narrative change, Lichtenstein attempted to change the perception of the boyfriend. When discussing another work (I Know...Brad), Lichtenstein stated that the name Brad sounded heroic to him and was used with the aim of clichéd oversimplification.|$|E
500|$|Urey {{speculated that}} the early {{terrestrial}} atmosphere was probably composed of ammonia, methane, and hydrogen. One [...] of his Chicago graduate students was Stanley L. Miller, who showed in the Miller–Urey experiment that, if such a mixture be exposed to electric sparks and water, it can interact to produce amino acids, commonly considered {{the building blocks of}} life. Work with isotopes of oxygen led to pioneering the new field of paleoclimatic research. In 1958, he accepted a post as a professor at large at the new University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where he helped create the science faculty. He was one of the founding members of UCSD's school of chemistry, which was created in 1960. He became increasingly interested in space science, and when Apollo 11 returned moon rock samples from the moon, Urey examined them at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. [...] Lunar astronaut Harrison Schmitt said that Urey approached him as a volunteer for a one-way mission to the Moon, stating [...] "I will go, and I don't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't come back." ...|$|E
500|$|A strong {{start to}} the 2006–07 Australian {{domestic}} season, exemplified by 150* against Tasmania in the Pura Cup and 126* against New South Wales in the Ford Ranger Cup (previously ING Cup) saw White recalled to the Australia one-day squad. [...] Chief of selectors, Andrew Hilditch described his inclusion in the squad, praising his [...] "great form with the bat and [...] has had some terrific performances with the ball". In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, White professed his relief at returning to the international scene, stating that [...] "I don't really <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> get picked as a batting allrounder or a bowling allrounder, or just as a bat or bowler, as long as I get picked." [...] An international Twenty20 against England saw White rewarded with {{a man of the}} match award for his 40* off 20 balls, and 1/11 with the ball in hand. In his next batting innings, White scored 45runs including 3sixes against New Zealand, leading teammate Andrew Symonds to praise his ability to strike the cricket ball, saying that [...] "when you've got that going on at the other end, it makes it a lot easier for me". Despite his excellent form with the bat, White's bowling was proving to be mostly ineffective. For this reason, as well as the improved form of Brad Hodge and the selection of Brad Hogg and Shane Watson for their ability with the ball, he was dropped for the finals of the Commonwealth Bank Series and left out of the World Cup squad.|$|E
2500|$|Barbeau {{was cast}} in {{numerous}} television films and series such as The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, Valentine Magic on Love Island and Battle of the Network Stars. In her autobiography, she claimed: [...] "I actually thought CBS asked me to be on Battle of the Network Stars because they thought I was athletic. My husband clued me in: who <b>cared</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> won the race, as long as I bounced when I ran?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know and}} <b>I</b> don't <b>care.</b> <b>If</b> ever <b>I</b> knew I've forgotten, and I'm glad of it," [...] was the response. [...] "Just watch me circle {{around and see}} me glitter! ...|$|R

2500|$|After the Boxer Campaign, {{the couple}} had at first {{exchanged}} letters, which Beatty signed 'Jack', as Ethel was still a married woman and discretion was advised. Ethel became involved with another man and the exchange of letters ceased but on Beatty's return she sent him a telegram and letter inviting him to resume their friendship. Beatty did not respond until after surgery on his arm in September 1900 when he wrote, [...] "I landed from China with my heart full of rage, and swore I did not <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever saw you again, or if I were killed or not. And now I have arrived with the firm determination not to see you at all in my own mind... Unfortunately I shall go on loving you to the bitter end... To me always a Queen, if not always mine, Good-bye." ...|$|E
2500|$|The teen pop newspaper, Go-Set started {{publishing}} in 1966, and in 1968, {{as a guest}} writer, Saddington provided an interview of soul and blues singer, Max Merritt. In March 1969 Saddington was described by The Canberra Timess Garry Raffaele as [...] "by far the best female rhythm and blues singer in the country. That's a relative judgment; objectively she is an exciting, raging swinger {{in the style of}} Aretha Franklin ... vocally she screams and roars and sighs with the rhythmic feel of [...] ". Saddington left the band in May that year prior to any known recordings, the band later shortened their name to Chain and had a hit with [...] "Black and Blue". In June 1969 she explained to Go-Set readers [...] "I only want to be in it up to my waist, not up to my neck ... My attitude was all wrong in the end. I didn't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> turned up late or drunk for a job ... knew I was unhappy, but they were powerless ... it was the promoters who handed out the money and they're a pack of misers".|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E

2500|$|He played {{music at}} clubs in Montana solo {{and with a}} four-piece combo called the Night Hawks during the time he lived in Montana. [...] His break came when [...] Chet Atkins at RCA Victor heard a {{demonstration}} tape and got Pride a contract. In 1966, he released his first RCA Victor single, [...] "The Snakes Crawl at Night". [...] Nashville manager and agent Jack D. Johnson signed Pride. Atkins was the longtime producer at RCA Victor who had made stars out of country singers such as Jim Reeves, Skeeter Davis, and others. Pride was signed to RCA Victor in 1965. [...] "The Snakes Crawl at Night" [...] did not chart. On the records of this song submitted to radio stations for airplay, the singer was listed as [...] "Country Charley Pride". At this time, country music was a white medium. Jack made sure that no pictures of Charley were distributed {{for the first two}} years of his career, to avoid the effects of Jim Crowism. [...] Pride disputes that the omission of a photo was deliberate; he stated that getting promoters to bring in a black country singer was a bigger problem: [...] "people didn’t <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was pink. RCA signed me... they knew I was colored...They decided to put the record out and let it speak for itself.” [...] While living in Montana, he continued to sing at local clubs, and in Great Falls had an additional boost to his career when he befriended local businessman Louis Allen “Al” Donohue, who owned radio stations including KMON, the first stations to play Pride's records in Montana.|$|E

5000|$|Although there aren't {{dialogue}} options, VA-11 HALL-A {{creates a}} storytelling experience that's grippingly personal. ...There were many instances when story and gameplay worked seamlessly in tandem during my playthrough. Like when a conversation became so engaging that, when a customer interrupted it {{to order a}} drink, I sighed heavily and rushed through the order, not <b>caring</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> made the drink well or not. With such spectacular writing and worldbuilding, VA-11 HALL-A is a game that makes you ignore all your game instincts. Jess Joho, Kill Screen ...|$|R

While helping to empty the vault's safe deposit boxes, Gal secretly pockets a pair of large ruby earrings encrusted with diamonds. After the job is done, Bass insists on driving Gal to the airport. Along the way, stops by Harry's home. Inside, Bass kills Harry in cold blood and immediately and pointedly questions Gal again about Logan. Gal merely responds, [...] "I'm not into this any more." [...] Back in the car, Bass suggests he knows what happened to Logan, saying first, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>cared,</b> Gal. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> fucking <b>cared.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> gave a solitary fuck about Don Logan!" [...] then [...] "Spain, eh? I must drop in sometime. Pay my respects."
