5|$|Boyars <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be {{executed}} without {{the knowledge and}} approval of the Transylvanian Prince and, if convicted for treason, their fortunes <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be confiscated. Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said {{in a conversation with}} the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: â€¦they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but as their own good required and obtained privileges for themselves. He would try to avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E

5|$|In 662, Maximus {{was placed}} on trial once more, and was once more convicted of heresy. Following the trial Maximus was tortured, having his tongue cut out, so he <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> speak his rebellion, and his right hand cut off, so that he <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> write letters. Maximus was then exiled to the Lazica or Colchis region of modern-day Georgia and was cast in the {{fortress}} of Schemarum, perhaps Muris-Tsikhe near the modern town of Tsageri. He died soon thereafter, on 13 August 662. The events of the trials of Maximus were recorded by Anastasius Bibliothecarius.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman Empire <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> {{depend on}} Egyptian troops to hold Greece. The {{strategic}} situation now resembled that existing before 1825 and the landing of Ibrahim Pasha. Then, the Greek insurgents had triumphed on all fronts.|$|E

5|$|After {{the change}} in organisation, Chetham's <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> afford to provide {{education}} based on scholarships and other allowances, and began charging fees. In 1952, the school buildings were considered insufficient so a new block was built, opening in 1955. By 1960 the numbers of boys admitted had increased significantly, particularly among day pupils; 230 non-boarding students attended that year, alongside 64 boarders.|$|E

5|$|But {{after his}} father enlisted during the Second World War, his mother <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> run the farm and raise the {{children}} by herself, so the family returned to Katanning and stayed there for seven years.

5|$|By 1893, the NYLE {{had gone}} {{bankrupt}} and was {{merged with the}} Erie Railroad, which became {{the owner of the}} bridge.

The last traffic crossed the old bridge on May 14, 1900, and removal of the old iron began on May 24.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, at {{the request}} of the New Zealand Parliament, King Edward VII proclaimed New Zealand a Dominion within the British Empire, {{reflecting}} its self-governing status.

5|$|In June 1874, Clayton {{announced}} that he <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> control matters in Arkansas and {{that he and his}} friends would be willing to enter into any arrangement whereby they could at least be safe from persecution and prosecution.

5|$|In {{the period}} {{leading up to}} 1776, a number of events led to a drastic change in the diet of the American colonists.
