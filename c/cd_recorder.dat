40|$|Since {{the wide}} {{availability}} of <b>cd</b> <b>recorders</b> {{and the possibility}} to share audio files over the internet, audio watermarking is a promising technology to protect the copyrights of the owners of such data. In {{the context of the}} development of the audio watermarking alogrithm ACWA, a framework was developed to evaluate the algorithm with regard to the requirements of quality and robustness. The quality evaluation is realised by implementing a web-based application that offers the possibility to perform subjective listening tests. Such a test may either be online, where all audio files are loaded from a server, or offline, where an audio cd containing the listening items is created. The evaluation of the robustness is supported by a VST plugin that integrates the existing audio watermarking algorithm in common audio tools. Beyond, the system for the quality evaluation was already used for a first listening test. The examples of this test are included in the thesis...|$|R

In this report, some attempts on the transducer of apexcardiogram were described. A precordial electrode was placed about 1. 5 mm above the chest wall of a patient. The electrostatic capacitance between the electrode and chest wall was transmitted to the CR oscillator and it modulated the frequency of pulse train generated with the oscillator. The signals were led to a conventional D. <b>C.</b> <b>recorder</b> or a cathode ray oscilloscope. There was no remarkable differences of the wave pattern between the apexcardiogram obtained by our method and by conventional piezoelectric transducer in normal cases. In some patients, however, some differences were observed especially in the depth of O-wave. The depth of O-wave increased in accordance with a rise in pressure of the transducer to the chest wall using the conventional method. The observations suggest that the A/E-O ratio might be varied depending on attaching pressure of the transducer to the chest wall...|$|R

5000|$|Error {{correction}} allows digital formats {{to tolerate}} {{quite a bit}} more media deterioration than analog formats. That is not to say poorly produced digital media are immune to data loss. Laser rot was most troublesome to the Laserdisc format, but also occurs to some pressed commercial CDs, and was caused in both cases by inadequate disc manufacture. [...] There can occasionally be difficulties related to the use of consumer recordable/rewritable compact discs. This may be due to poor-quality <b>CD</b> <b>recorder</b> drives, low-quality discs, or incorrect storage, as the information-bearing dye layer of most CD-recordable discs is at least slightly sensitive to UV light and will be slowly bleached out if exposed to any amount of it. Most digital recordings rely at least to some extent on computational encoding and decoding and so may become completely unplayable if not enough consecutive good data is available for the decoder to synchronize to the digital data stream, whereas any intact segment of any size of an analog recording is playable.|$|E

40|$|Good morning. My name is Peter Tatian and I am {{a senior}} {{researcher}} in the Urban Institute’s Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center. I am also director of NeighborhoodInfo DC, an information resource for the District of Columbia. 1 I {{am happy to}} provide this testimony highlighting data compiled by NeighborhoodInfo DC on housing foreclosures and project-based Section 8 housing in Washington, D. C. Foreclosures First, I will talk about foreclosures. The delinquency rate for all mortgages, and especially subprime or high-cost mortgages, has increased over the past year, and these higher delinquencies have resulted in more foreclosures. Increased delinquency and foreclosure rates are largely the result of resets to adjustable-rate loans that were made with a low “teaser ” rate that was initially affordable to the borrower. Nationally, subprime adjustable-rate mortgages accounted for 7 percent of mortgages outstanding, but 43 percent of all foreclosures initiated {{in the third quarter}} of 2007 (Stokes and Mechem 2007). Consistent with national trends, a local increase in subprime lending has been followed by a surge in home foreclosures. In the District of Columbia, subprime lending increased from 3. 2 percent of conventional home purchase and refinance mortgage loans in 2002, to 12. 5 percent in 2005 (Tatian 2007 a). Levels of subprime lending have been highest in Wards 4, 5, 7, and 8, where almost four of every ten home purchase loans was a high-cost loan in 2005 (Tatian 2007 b). According to data from the D. <b>C.</b> <b>Recorder</b> of Deeds analyzed by NeighborhoodInfo DC, the number of notices of foreclosure filed against residential property owners in D. C. has almost doubled between 2005 and 2007 (table 1). The highest number of notices filed in 2007 were in Ward 5 (523 notices), Ward 7 1 NeighborhoodInfo DC is a partnership between the Urban Institute and the Washington, D. C., Local Initiative...|$|R

This means that consorts could be composed of instruments nominally in B, F, C, G, D, A and even E, although typically only three or four distinct sizes were used simultaneously. To use modern terminology, these recorders were treated as transposing instruments: consorts would be read identically to a consort made up of F3, C4, and G4 instruments. This is made possible by the fact that adjacent sizes are separated by fifths, with few exceptions. These parts would be written using chiavi naturali, allowing the parts to roughly fit in the range of a single staff, and also in the range of the recorders of the period.
