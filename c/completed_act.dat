50|$|Until {{the early}} 19th century, courts were divided {{on whether the}} act needed to be {{completed}} (to result in ejaculation) {{in order to be}} a punishable offense. This question was deemed sufficiently important that, in 1828, English law was explicitly amended to specify that proof of ejaculation was not necessary for convictions for buggery and rape. The crime was not limited to same-sex activities, and, in case of an act between two adults, both participants were guilty, regardless of consent. Attempted or <b>completed</b> <b>act</b> of sodomy, committed by a husband against his wife, was grounds for divorce in common law.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the belief}} that de Gouges {{was the center of}} a Royalist {{conspiracy}} stemmed from her involvement with multiple wealthy aristocrats and her desires to rid herself of her provincial accent. Upon posting her note demanding the plebiscite, the Jacobins discovered a partially complete play written by de Gouges parodying the Revolution - the play begins with the Revolutionaries (including de Gouges) demanding rights; the only Act <b>completed,</b> <b>Act</b> I, ends with de Gouges lecturing Marie Antoinette and teaching her ways to govern. The Jacobins, in an effort to find evidence that de Gouges was treasonous, fabricated a conspiracy surrounding this play and the Declaration that de Gouges, in fact, was desiring to overthrow the Revolution.|$|E

5000|$|Monna Vanna (Монна Ванна) is an {{unfinished}} opera by Sergei Rachmaninoff after a play by Maurice Maeterlinck. Rachmaninoff had <b>completed</b> <b>Act</b> I in short vocal score, with piano accompaniment, {{and then he}} went to ask for permission to set the text in a full three-act treatment. However, another composer, Henry Février, had by then received the rights to an operatic setting of the text. Had Rachmaninoff proceeded to a complete operatic setting, such a work could not have been produced in European countries that were signatories to copyright laws that covered the work of Maeterlinck. This opera could only have been produced in countries that at the time were not signatories to European copyright law, such as Russia. Ultimately, Rachmaninoff abandoned further work on this opera and never wrote a complete setting.|$|E

5000|$|Bereshith bara elohim, the RSV's [...] "In the {{beginning}} God created...", {{is in the}} construct state (bereshith), not the absolute (barishona), meaning it refers to an action in progress, not to a <b>completed</b> <b>act.</b> Similarly, there is no license in the Hebrew for the RSV's division of these verses into three sentences (ancient Hebrew lacked punctuation, and sentence divisions have to be inferred), as {{the order of the}} words wa ha-aretz hayetha (subject-verb) points to the rendering [...] "the earth being" [...] (Young's [...] "the earth hath existed"), while the RSV's [...] "and the earth was" [...] requires words in the order wa tehi ha-aretz (verb-subject). Young's usage of English present tense rather than past tense has been supported by scholars ranging from the medieval Jewish rabbi Rashi (who advised, [...] "If you are going to interpret passage in its plain sense, interpret it thus: At {{the beginning}} of the creation of heaven and earth, when the earth was (or the earth being) unformed and void [...] [...] [...] God said, ‘Let there be light.’") to Richard Elliott Friedman in his translation of the Five Books in [...] "The Bible with Sources Revealed" [...] (2002).|$|E
5000|$|The {{composition}} of the music for Pirates was unusual, in that Sullivan wrote the music for the acts in reverse, intending to bring the <b>completed</b> <b>Act</b> II with him to New York, with Act I existing only in sketches. When he arrived in New York, however, he found that {{he had left the}} sketches behind, and he had to reconstruct the first act from memory. Gilbert told a correspondent many years later that Sullivan was unable to recall his setting of the entrance of the women's chorus, so they substituted the chorus [...] "Climbing over rocky mountain" [...] from their earlier opera, Thespis. Sullivan's manuscript for Pirates contains pages removed from a Thespis score, with the vocal parts of this chorus altered from their original arrangement as a four-part chorus. Some scholars (e.g. Tillett and Spencer, 2000) have suggested that Gilbert and Sullivan had planned all along to re-use [...] "Climbing over rocky mountain," [...] and perhaps other parts of Thespis. They argue that Sullivan's having the unpublished Thespis score in New York, when there were no plans to revive Thespis, might not have been accidental. In any case, on 10 December 1879, Sullivan wrote a letter to his mother about the new opera, upon which he was hard at work in New York. [...] "I {{think it will be a}} great success, for it is exquisitely funny, and the music is strikingly tuneful and catching." [...] As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the overture for the last moment, sketching it out and entrusting its composition to the company's music director, in this case Alfred Cellier.|$|E
40|$|Artemesinin-combination therapies (ACT) for {{falciparum malaria}} reduce gametocyte carriage, and {{therefore}} reduce transmission. Artemisinin derivatives will act against only young gametocytes whereas primaquine acts on mature gametocytes which are present {{usually in the}} circulation {{at the time when}} the patient presents for treatment. Both artemisinin derivatives and primaquine have short half-lives, less than 1 hr and 7 hr, respectively. Therefore, asexual parasites or young gametocytes remain after <b>completed</b> <b>ACT.</b> A single dose of primaquine (0. 50 - 0. 75 mg base/kg) at the end of ACT can kill only mature gametocytes but cannot kill young gametocytes (if present). Remaining asexual forms after completion of ACT course, e. g., artesunate-mefloquine for 3 days, may develop to mature gametocytes 7 - 15 days later. Thus, an additional dose of primaquine (0. 50 - 0. 75 mg base/kg) given 2 weeks after ACT completion may be beneficial for killing remaining mature gametocytes and contribute to more interruption of Plasmodium falciparum transmission than giving only 1 single dose of primaquine just after completing ACT...|$|E

40|$|Either of {{the first}} two introns of the Arabidopsis {{tryptophan}} pathway gene PAT 1 elevates mRNA accumulation from a PAT 1 :β-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion roughly 5 -fold without affecting the rate of PAT 1 :GUS transcription. To further explore the mechanism of this intron-mediated enhancement of gene expression, we wanted to determine whether splicing or specific intron sequences were necessary. In-frame derivatives of PAT 1 intron 1, whose splicing was prevented by a point mutation or large deletions, were able to increase mRNA accumulation from a PAT 1 :GUS fusion, demonstrating that splicing per se is not required. Furthermore, each of a series of introns containing overlapping deletions that together span PAT 1 intron 1 increased PAT 1 :GUS mRNA accumulation as much as the full-length intron did, indicating that all intron sequences are individually dispensable for this phenomenon. These results eliminate the simple idea that this intron stimulates mRNA accumulation via a unique RNA-stabilizing sequence or through the <b>completed</b> <b>act</b> of splicing. However, they are consistent with a possible role for redundant intron sequence elements or an association of the pre-mRNA with the spliceosome...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the murders in Czech Republic in 2000 - 2011. Its aim is to inform the reader about the {{development}} of number of murders and their classification according to different criteria, which are not normally available to the public. The work will capture an overall trend in the development of number of murders in selected years. The murders will be divided according to their termination, which is meant, if the case was closed, forwarded to another department of the Police of the Czech Republic, if the case was suspended in accordance pursuant to § 159 a/ 4 or if the case was postponed for another reason. Murders will be also divided according to stage {{at the time of the}} apprehension of the offender (<b>completed</b> <b>act,</b> attempt or preparation), typology (dial M for murder, infanticide, murder motivated by personal relationships, etc.) a crime scene by region. In this work will be also captured the characteristics of the offender, according to sex, age and nationality.

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate about the “ontology” of consent. Some {{argue that it is}} a mental act, some that it is a “hybrid” of a mental act plus {{behaviour}} that signifies that act; others argue that consent is a performative, akin to promising or commanding. Here it is argued that all these views are mistaken—though some more so than others. We begin with the question whether a normatively efficacious act of consent can be completed in the mind alone. Standard objections to this “mentalist” account of consent can be rebutted. Here we identify a much deeper problem for mentalism. Normatively transformative acts of consent change others’ reasons for acting in a distinctive—“robust”—way. Robust reason-changing involves acts aimed at fulfilling a distinctive kind of reflexive and recognition-directed intention. Such acts cannot be coherently performed in the mind alone. Consent is not a mental act, but nor is it the signification of such an act. Acts of consent cannot be “completed” in the mind, and {{it is a mistake to}} view consent behaviour as making known a <b>completed</b> <b>act</b> of consent. The robust reason-changing account of consent developed here shares something with the performative theory, but is not saddled with a label whose home is philosophy of language. Certain kinds of performative utterance may change reasons robustly, but not all robust reason-changing involves or requires acts of speech, and consent can be effected by a wide range of behavioural acts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Self-assessment of {{symptoms}} by {{patients with chronic}} conditions is {{an important element of}} disease management. A recent study in a commercially-insured population found that patients who received automated telephone calls for asthma self-assessment felt they benefitted from the calls. Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of disease self-assessment in Medicaid populations. The goals of this study were to: (1) assess the feasibility of asthma self-assessment in a population predominantly insured by Medicaid, (2) study whether adding a gift card incentive increased completion of the self-assessment survey, and (3) evaluate how the self-assessment affected processes and outcomes of care. Methods We studied adults and children aged 4 years and older who were insured by a Medicaid-focused managed care organization (MCO) in a pre- and post-intervention study. During the pre-incentive period, patients with computerized utilization data that met specific criteria for problematic asthma control were mailed the Asthma Control Test (ACT), a self-assessment survey, and asked to return it to the MCO. During the intervention period, patients were offered a $ 20 gift card for returning the <b>completed</b> <b>ACT</b> to the MCO. To evaluate clinical outcomes, we used computerized claims data to assess the number of hospitalization visits and emergency department visits experienced in the 3 months after receiving the ACT. To evaluate whether the self-management intervention improved processes of care, we conducted telephone interviews with patients who returned or did not return the ACT by mail. Results During the pre-incentive period, 1183 patients were identified as having problems with asthma control; 25 (2. 0 %) of these returned the ACT to the MCO. In contrast, during the incentive period, 1612 patients were identified as having problems with asthma control and 87 (5. 4 %) of these returned the ACT to the MCO (p During the 3 months after they received the ACT, patients who completed it had similar numbers of outpatient visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations for asthma as patients who did not complete the ACT. We completed interviews with 95 patients, including 28 who had completed the ACT and 67 who had not. Based on an ACT administered {{at the time of the}} interview, patients who had previously returned the ACT to the MCO had asthma control similar to those who had not (mean scores of 14. 2 vs. 14. 6, p = 0. 70). Patients had similar rates of contacting their providers within the past 2 months whether they had completed the mailed ACT or not (71 % vs. 76 %, p = 0. 57). Conclusion Mailing asthma self-assessment surveys to patients with poorly controlled asthma was not associated with better asthma-associated outcomes or processes of care in the Medicaid population studied. Adding a gift card incentive did not meaningfully increase response rates. Asthma disease management programs for Medicaid populations will most likely need to involve alternative strategies for engaging patients and their providers in managing their conditions. </p...|$|E
