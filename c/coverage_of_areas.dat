30|$|Mobile {{users in}} next {{generation}} communication systems are expecting seamless coverage with a guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) {{to allow for}} a similar user experience as provided by today's broadband internet connections. This causes a high spectrum demand of approximately 100 [*]MHz to support high aggregate data rates of up to 1 [*]Gbit/s, which will only be available at frequencies higher than 2 [*]GHz. The World Radio Conference 2007 has, for example, identified 200 [*]MHz at 3.4 [*]GHz for IMT systems.

Furthermore, the degree of <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> B, and C in the university entrance exam should be determined in relation to the extent to which the university EFL instruction can bridge the gap between secondary school EFL and the English language demands in university content courses. In contrast, including D and E in the entrance examination would not be feasible because they require the use of English assuming disciplinary knowledge.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. National {{ministries}} {{of agriculture}} and competent EU authorities cur-rently have the reforms of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) high on their agendas in terms of planning and designing the upcoming programmatic period. Also subjected to this debate are the allocation of the budget to each pillar and their territorial impact. The interest of this article lies with two interrelated aspects. The first comprises {{an overview of the}} Pillar II budget and how this is allocated within EU member states. The second considers how these measures relate and contribute to the im-provement of the socio-economic situation and the state of the environment in ru-ral areas of the EU in general, and in Estonia and Finland in particular. Seemingly, the way funding has been allocated thus far, with a heavy focus on agriculture and directly related activities, is not appropriately suited to facilitate a holistic improvement of the state of rural areas of the EU, while it does not reflect the con-temporary economic transition processes in these areas.
