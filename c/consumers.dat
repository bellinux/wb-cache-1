40|$|Graduation date: 1992 The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} <b>consumer</b> knowledge and attitudes toward <b>consumer</b> education of college students in secondary teacher education preparatory programs in Korea. Specifically, this study was aimed to 1) measure the degree of <b>consumer</b> knowledge of college students in secondary teacher education preparatory programs, 2) assess the influences of socio-demographic variables such as academic level, academic major, sex, total family income, urban/rural background, and previous coursework in <b>consumer</b> economics on <b>consumer</b> knowledge, 3) evaluate attitudes of college students in secondary teacher education preparatory programs in Korea toward <b>consumer</b> education, 4) assess the influences of socio-demographic variables on attitudes toward <b>consumer</b> education, 5) examine the relationship between the degree of total <b>consumer</b> knowledge and attitudes toward <b>consumer</b> education when other socio-demographic variables are controlled. The sample was 388 freshmen and seniors in secondary teacher education preparatory programs, with majors in home economics, social studies, and business education, in the five randomly selected colleges in Korea. They were tested during May, 1991. The mean score for <b>consumer</b> knowledge was 30. 18 which represented 75. 4 percent correct. The relationships between <b>consumer</b> knowledge and selected socio-demographic variables were investigated using a one-way ANOVA. The results were as follow: 1) The degree of total <b>consumer</b> knowledge differed significantly by academic level, 2) The degree of total <b>consumer</b> knowledge and knowledge of the subarea of economic principles, <b>consumer</b> advocacy and buying practices differed significantly by academic major, 3) Only the degree of knowledge of the sub-area of buying practices differed significantly by sex, 4) There was no significant difference in the degree of total <b>consumer</b> knowledge and any sub-areas of <b>consumer</b> knowledge by total family income, 5) The degree of total <b>consumer</b> knowledge and knowledge of the sub-area of economic principles differed significantly by urban/rural background, 6) There was no significant difference in the degree of total <b>consumer</b> knowledge and any sub-areas of <b>consumer</b> knowledge by previous coursework in <b>consumer</b> economics. The mean score of attitudes toward <b>consumer</b> education was 2. 94 on a scale of 1 to 4. The relationships of attitudes toward <b>consumer</b> education and socio-demographic variables were examined using a one-way ANOVA. Attitudes toward <b>consumer</b> education differed significantly only by previous coursework in <b>consumer</b> economics. To examine the relationship between the degree of total <b>consumer</b> knowledge and attitudes toward <b>consumer</b> education when other socio-demographic variables are controlled, a stepwise multiple regression anaysis was used. There was a significant positive relationship between <b>consumer</b> knowledge and attitudes toward <b>consumer</b> education. The results indicated that students majoring in home economics, female students, students who have taken <b>consumer</b> economics coursework, and students who have a higher degree of <b>consumer</b> knowledge have more favorable attitudes toward <b>consumer</b> education...|$|R
5|$|Species are broadly {{categorized}} as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or <b>consumers),</b> and Detritivores (or decomposers). Autotrophs are organisms that {{produce their own}} food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including primary <b>consumers</b> (strict herbivores), secondary <b>consumers</b> (carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary <b>consumers</b> (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues.

25|$|<b>Consumers</b> {{typically}} have positive attitudes for {{products that are}} ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, <b>consumers</b> often {{are not willing to}} pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee <b>consumers</b> can say {{they would be willing to}} pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most <b>consumers</b> are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious <b>consumers</b> with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee. Once enough <b>consumers</b> begin purchasing fair trade, companies are more likely to carry fair trade products.

Many product-focused online social platforms have included design features that can convey {{more information about}} product quality {{as well as the}} credibility {{of the members of the}} social community. Drawing on information signaling theory, we empirically examine how the two social information cues frequently found on online social communities, action-based social information (i. e., peer <b>consumer</b> purchase) and opinion-based social information (i. e., peer <b>consumer</b> review), influence <b>consumer</b> purchase decisions. We also explore the moderating role of <b>consumer</b> characteristics, <b>consumer</b> engagement and <b>consumer</b> expertise. Analyzing panel data (n = 39, 897) collected from a popular online beauty community, we found that <b>consumer</b> purchase decisions are indeed influenced by the two social information cues and that action-based social information is more influential than opinion-based social information.
