50|$|<b>Cefovecin</b> (INN) is an {{antibiotic}} of the cephalosporin class, licensed {{for the treatment}} of skin infections in cats and dogs. It is marketed by Zoetis under the trade name Convenia. It is used to treat skin infections caused by Pasturella multocida in cats, and Staphylococcus intermedius and Streptococcus canis in dogs. The advantage of using a long-acting injectable antibiotic is that, unlike with daily administration, doses cannot be missed, which may allow partially resistant microbes to recover. The disadvantage is the presence of subtherapeutic concentrations in the weeks after the resolution of infections. This is associated with the development of resistance in microbes. It should not be used in pregnant or lactating animals or in animals with a history of allergies to penicillin or cephalosporin drugs.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cefovecin</b> sodium is a long-acting, third-generation, {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic {{approved for}} the treatment of skin infections in dogs and cats. The pharmacokinetic properties of <b>cefovecin</b> were evaluated in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), olive baboons (Papio anubis), and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) by using a single-dose (8 mg/kg SC) dosing regimen. Plasma <b>cefovecin</b> concentrations were determined by using ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, and a noncompartmental model was used to determine pharmacokinetic parameters. The half-life of <b>cefovecin</b> was 4. 95 ± 1. 47 h in cynomolgus macaques, 9. 17 ± 1. 84 h in olive baboons, and 8. 40 ± 2. 53 h in rhesus macaques. These values are considerably lower than the half-lives previously published for dogs (133 h) and cats (166 h). The extended half-life of <b>cefovecin</b> in dogs and cats is speculated to be due to active reabsorption of drug in the kidney tubules because plasma clearance is well below the normal glomerular filtration rate. In nonhuman primates, renal clearance rates approximated plasma clearance rates, suggesting that active renal reabsorption of <b>cefovecin</b> does not occur in these species. The pharmacokinetic properties of <b>cefovecin</b> in nonhuman primates are vastly different from the pharmacokinetic properties in dogs and cats, precluding its use as a long-acting antibiotic in nonhuman primates.

Antimicrobial resistance was determined using disc diffusion, MIC, and detected using PCR for the bla[subscript CMY- 2] gene on select isolates. Mean plasma concentration of <b>cefovecin</b> on day 14 was 9. 59 µg/mL in treated dogs; untreated dogs had no measurable plasma <b>cefovecin.</b> The absolute number of E. coli was lower in treated dogs on day 3 (P ≤ 0. 0001), and the absolute number of cefovecin-resistant E. coli was higher in treated dogs on days 7 (P = 0. 002), 14 (P = 0. 004) and 28 (P ≤ 0. 0001), compared to untreated dogs.

40|$|Background While Koch’s postulates {{have been}} {{fulfilled}} for Lyme disease; causing transient fever, anorexia and arthritis in young dogs; treatment of sero-positive dogs, especially asymptomatic animals, remains {{a topic of}} debate. To complicate this matter the currently recommended antibiotic treatments of Lyme Disease in dogs caused by Borrelia burgdorferi require daily oral administrations for 31 days or longer, which makes non-compliance a concern. Additionally, there is no approved veterinary antimicrobial {{for the treatment of}} Lyme Disease in dogs in the USA and few recommended treatments have been robustly tested. In vitro testing of <b>cefovecin,</b> a novel extended-spectrum cephalosporin, demonstrated inhibition of spirochete growth. A small pilot study in dogs indicated that two <b>cefovecin</b> injections two weeks apart would be as efficacious against B. burgdorferi sensu stricto as the recommended treatments using doxycycline or amoxicillin daily for 31 days. This hypothesis was tested in 17 – 18 week old Beagle dogs, experimentally infected with B. burgdorferisensu stricto, using wild caught ticks, 75 days prior to antimicrobial administration. Results Clinical observations for lameness were performed daily but were inconclusive as this characteristic sign of Lyme Disease rarely develops in the standard laboratory models of experimentally induced infection. However, each antibiotic tested was efficacious against B. burgdorferi as measured by a rapid elimination of spirochetes from the skin and reduced levels of circulating antibodies to B. burgdorferi. In addition, significantly less <b>cefovecin</b> treated animals had Lyme Disease associated histopathological changes compared to untreated dogs. Conclusions Convenia was efficacious against B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infection in dogs as determined by serological testing, PCR and histopathology results.

40|$|The {{development}} and spread of antimicrobial resistance is of considerable and growing concern. To {{better understand the}} relationship between the use of antimicrobial drugs and emerging antimicrobial resistance, surveillance of the antimicrobial use should take place. The main aim {{of this study was to}} obtain baseline data on systemic antimicrobial veterinary medicinal product (VMP) usage in dogs and cats in the Netherlands, by starting to quantify and asses the usage of systemic antimicrobial VMP’s in dog and cats in the Netherlands during 2009 - 2011, using the daily dosage per animal year (DDD/j) as the unit of measurement. All Dutch small animal veterinary practices were invited. Data recorded in practice management systems (PMS’s) of 68 veterinary practices were used to calculate the DDD/j. In 2009 the average dog and cat in the Netherlands received 3, 42 DDD/j (n= 59 practices), decreasing to 3, 40 DDD/j in 2010 (n= 65 practices) and 3, 23 DDD/j in 2011 (n= 67 practices). The most received classes of antimicrobial VMP’s in dogs and cats in the Netherlands are the combination of penicillins, inclusive beta-lactamase inhibitors (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) : 38, 29 %, 36, 32 %, 38, 24 %, respectively 2009 (n= 59), 2010 (n= 65), 2011 (n= 67), followed by the penicillins with extended spectrum (amoxicillin, ampicillin) : 13, 19 %, 13, 01 %, 11, 73 %, respectively 2009 (n= 59), 2010 (n= 65), 2011 (n= 67). The third and fourth most received classes of antimicrobial VMP’s in dogs and cats in the Netherlands are the cephalosporins 3 rd generation (<b>cefovecin)</b> : 11, 95 %, 11, 14 %, 10, 23 %, respectively 2009 (n= 59), 2010 (n= 65), 2011 (n= 67) and cephalosporins 1 st generation (cefalexin, cefadroxil) : 10, 63 %, 11, 43 %, 11, 25 %, respectively 2009 (n= 59), 2010 (n= 65), 2011 (n= 67).

40|$|The {{first major}} {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} antimicrobial susceptibilities from the most common pathogens isolated from clinical samples, from food animals and companion animals submitted to the bacteriology diagnostic laboratory at Atlantic Veterinary College over a 20 years period, which is described in chapters 2 and 3. The second major objective was to determine the antimicrobial resistance and the associated resistance genes to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) and fluoroquinolones in enteric bacteria from dairy cattle and humans within the Maritime Provinces using selective culture (chapters 4 to 6). Chapter 5 ’s objective was to explore if colostrum was a potential source of ESC and fluoroquinolone resistance identified in calves from chapter 4. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and resistance trends in pathogens from cattle, small ruminants and pigs were described in chapter 2. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, and Escherichia coli were the predominantly isolated agents of bovine mastitis, while E. coli, P. multocida, M. haemolytica, and H. somni were the major bacteria isolated from small ruminants and non-mastitis clinical samples of cattle. Escherichia coli, S. suis, and P. multocida accounted for over 70 % of the total pathogens isolated from clinical samples originating from pigs. A high proportion of the food animal pathogens were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested over the entire study period, especially the mastitis pathogens and pathogens isolated from small ruminants. Decreased resistance to aminoglycosides was consistent in all three food animal species. However, increased resistance to ceftiofur was found in E. coli from cattle and pigs over the period. In general, multi-drug resistance (MDR) was higher in cattle and pigs compared to small ruminants. In cattle isolates (mastitis and non-mastitis pathogens), MDR was higher in Gram-negative pathogens, especially E. coli, and in small ruminants, MDR was most commonly found in M. haemolytica and P. multocida. Interestingly in swine, MDR was common in Gram-positive isolates, such as Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and Staphylococcus spp. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and AMR trends in pathogens from horses, cats, and dogs were described in chapter 3. Streptococcus zooepidemicus and E. coli were the most commonly isolated pathogens of horses. Similar bacterial pathogens were isolated from both dogs and cats with E. coli and Staphylococcus spp. being the most frequently isolated Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, respectively. Among the horse pathogens, lower susceptibility frequencies were common to tetracycline, TMS, and ampicillin, while isolates were frequently susceptible to ceftiofur. Higher susceptibilities (compared to horses) were seen in dog and cat pathogens, although cat pathogens {{were more likely to be}} susceptible to tested antimicrobials compared with bacterial species recovered from dogs. Generally, among the companion animals, most AMR trends were stable over the study period. While increased resistance was seen to both amikacin and gentamicin in Actinobacillus spp., and Streptococcus zooepidemicus to TMS in the horse. Increased antimicrobial resistance trends were commonly seen to enrofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate in dog pathogens. Increased resistance to <b>cefovecin</b> was also observed in coagulase-positive Staphylococcus spp. in dogs. Decreasing AMR trends were found to the aminoglycosides in dog and cat pathogens. Multi-drug resistance in equine pathogens was low, however, when it was seen, it was more commonly found in Gram-negative pathogens, especially Klebsiella spp. and E. coli. Multi-drug resistance was generally low in dog and cat pathogens, but the frequency was significantly higher in dogs compared to cats and horses. All methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. from dogs were MDR in this study. In chapter 4, the frequency and risk factors of reduced susceptibility to extendedspectrum cephalosporin resistance were examined in Salmonella enterica and E. coli from fecal samples from 488 dairy calves from eight herds using selective culture. The frequency of fecal carriage of Salmonella enterica was low (3. 3 %). The recovered Salmonella isolates were pan-susceptible, and ESC resistance was not detected. All the Salmonella enterica isolates belonged to three serovars: Senftenberg, Typhimurium DT 02, and Derby. Eighty-one percent of calves were positive for E. coli with reduced susceptibility to ESC (sESC-R E. coli). From the selected sESC-R E. coli (n= 100), 88 % demonstrated phenotypic resistance to ESC (ceftriaxone and/or ceftiofur) based on MIC testing. From these 88 ESC-R E. coli; blaTEM was detected in 84. 1 %, blaCMY- 2 was detected in 52. 2 %, 15. 9 % were blaCTX-M- 9 positive, 9. 1 % blaCTX-M- 1 positive, 9. 1 % were blaCTX-M- 2 positive, and blaSHV was detected in 1. 1 % of isolates. Sixty percent (60 %) of the ESC-R E. coli had two or more β-lactamase resistance genes. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were detected from seven of the nine isolates with reduced susceptibility to quinolones. Five isolates were positive for qnrB alone, and two isolates were positive for both qnrB and qnrS. Neonatal age calves (OR= 2. 42), regular ceftiofur use on the farm (OR= 3. 83) feeding of unpasteurized, non-saleable milk (OR= 1. 6), use of florfenicol (OR= 2. 02) and use of ceftiofur for the treatment of respiratory diseases (OR= 0. 57) were associated with the fecal recovery of E. coli with reduced susceptibility to ESC. In chapter 5, the potential role of dairy colostrum as a source of antimicrobial resistant bacteria to newborn dairy calves was examined. ESC-R E. coli were detected in 20 (4. 43 %) of the 452 colostrum samples. At least one ESC-R E. coli isolate was detected in 6 (75 %) of the 8 dairy herds. All ESC-R E. coli had phenotypic MDR profiles. No blaCTX-M group genes were detected, but blaCMY- 2 and blaTEM genes were detected in nine (45 %), and seven (35 %) of the twenty ESC-R E. coli isolates recovered. In chapter 6, the frequency of humans’ fecal carriage of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., carbapenem-resistant E. coli, and generic E. coli with reduced susceptibility to ESC and fluoroquinolones were examined. The recovery of ESCresistant and quinolone-resistant E. coli was low (< 10 %) out of 489 human fecal samples. Carbapenem-resistant E. coli and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis or faecium were not detected in any samples in this study. The β-lactamase-resistance gene profile of the 26 ESC-R E. coli isolates was as follows: 25 (96. 2 %) of harbored blaTEM, 18 (69. 2 %) harbored blaCMY- 2, 16 (61. 5 %) harbored blaCTX-M groups (blaCTX-M- 1 = 9, blaCTX-M- 9 = 5, and blaCTX-M- 2 = 2 isolates), and two (7. 7 %) isolates harbored blaSHV resistance genes. The majority of isolates (92. 3 %) harbored two or more resistance genes. Twenty-one (8. 3 %) out of 253 human fecal samples were positive for qnr-producing E. coli isolates. Of the E. coli isolates, Three (14. 3 %) harbored qnrB, five (23. 8 %) harbored qnrS, and thirteen (61. 9 %) were positive for both qnrB and qnrS genes. Overall, this research has provided valuable information on the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of commonly cultured pathogens from food and companion animals from the Atlantic region of Canada. This information may influence the rational use of antimicrobials by clinicians in choosing empirical therapies and treatment protocols within the food animal industries and companion animal veterinary practices in Atlantic Canada. Also, this study has provided an estimate of extended spectrum cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone resistance in dairy calves and humans, as well as carbapenem and vancomycin resistance in humans within Prince Edward Island. Additionally, this research has provided information on the resistance genes associated with the occurrence of ESC and fluoroquinolone resistance in Atlantic Canada...|$|E
