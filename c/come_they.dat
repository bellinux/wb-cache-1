25|$|An {{expressed}} sequence tag (EST) is a short {{nucleotide sequence}} generated from a single RNA transcript. RNA is first copied as complementary DNA (cDNA) by a reverse transcriptase enzyme before the resultant cDNA is sequenced. The Sanger method of sequencing was predominant until the advent of high-throughput methods such as sequencing by synthesis (Solexa/Illumina). Because ESTs don't require prior knowledge of the organism from which they <b>come,</b> <b>they</b> can also be made from mixtures of organisms or environmental samples. Although higher-throughput methods are now used, EST libraries commonly provided sequence information for early microarray designs, for example, a barley GeneChip was designed from 350,000 previously sequenced ESTs.|$|E

From this fact the opinion of those men appears somewhat probable who hold that the Saxons were descended from the Greeks, because the Greeks call Mars Hirmin or Hermes, a word which we use even to this day, either for blame or praise, without knowing its meaning.|$|E

500|$|The Rhein {{class of}} ironclad {{riverine}} monitors (Flußkanonenboote) were {{a pair of}} ships built by the German Imperial Navy {{in the aftermath of}} the Franco-Prussian War. The class comprised two ships, Rhein and Mosel; both were built by the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen, in 18721874. They were armed with a pair of [...] bronze cannon in a revolving gun turret. The ships were intended to protect the German border with France in the event of a conflict, but had short service lives, as war did not <b>come.</b> <b>They</b> served briefly in the defenses of Coblenz, starting in 1875, before being withdrawn from service.

The location of the incident is at least 20 minutes roundtrip from the nearest building – the People's Great Hall." [...] John Gittings of The Guardian stated, however, that it was common practice in many countries for police camera operators to be on hand when a public disturbance is anticipated; the police used small-scale fire-extinguishers of the type carried in public vehicles, many of which are routinely on the square.|$|E

Eventually more dreams of woe draw them back to the lake where danger and destiny await.|$|E
500|$|True Finns {{have said}} that Finland should not financially support the European Financial Stability Facility that led to bailouts for Ireland and Greece. Timo Soini asked: [...] "How <b>come</b> <b>they</b> (the European Union) can't see the euro doesn't work?" [...] The party {{manifesto}} {{said that they would}} support a capital gains tax increase from 28% to 30% and an increased tax on alcohol. The party also opposed mention of Finland's EU membership in the constitution and want to cut social welfare for immigrants. Soini also suggested Finland should unilaterally withdraw from the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and some other international commitments and that giving up the euro was an option. While speculating about a possible ministerial portfolio he later backed down on commitments when journalists asked him if the issues would be True Finns' demands in any possible government formation talks, citing the proposals as his personal opinion and not necessarily incorporated into a prospective government policy programme. He continued to maintain that the EU membership issue in the constitution would be a threshold for their participation in government formation talks. Helsingin Sanomat suggested that these demands could prove detrimental to a chance for True Finns to join a governing coalition. The True Finns also support the continuation of social welfare benefits. The party's support for the benefits along with its stance on the EU bailouts was also seen as one reason for its growth in popularity {{at a time when the}} country was facing welfare cuts by the government. The True Finns' vice-chairman Vesa-Matti Saarakkala said that [...] "the True Finns will not participate in a coalition government with any party ready to give further loan guarantees". This stance on the EU's bailout was read by The Wall Street Journal as detrimental to the euro zone's attempt to reassure bond investors that it would not face debt problems. It also said that a good showing for the True Finns could threaten Portugal's EU-sponsored bailout.|$|E
