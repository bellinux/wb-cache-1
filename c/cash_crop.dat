It was found that married women are involved in the production of a relatively greater amount of output of <b>cash</b> <b>crops</b> than unmarried women since husbands prefer to have more land under <b>cash</b> <b>crops</b> than food crops. Farmers with better quality land allocate a high proportion of it to non-food <b>cash</b> <b>crops,</b> which may expose some households to greater risks of possible famine.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the effects of commercialisation of agriculture on land use and work patterns {{by means of a}} case study in the Nyeri district in Kenya. The study uses cross sectional data collected from small-scale farmers in this district. We find that good quality land is allocated to non-food <b>cash</b> <b>crops,</b> which may lead to a reduction in non-cash food crops and expose some households to greater risks of possible famine. Also the proportion of land allocated to food crops declines as the farm size increases while the proportion of land allocated to non-food <b>cash</b> <b>crops</b> rises as the size of farm increases. <b>Cash</b> <b>crops</b> are also not bringing in as much revenue commensurate with the amount of land allocated to them. With growing commercialisation, women still work more hours than men. They not only work on non-cash food crops but also on <b>cash</b> <b>crops</b> including non-food <b>cash</b> <b>crops.</b> Evidence indicates that women living with husbands work longer hours than those married but living alone, and also longer than the unmarried women. Married women seem to lose their decision-making ability with growth of commercialisation, as husbands make most decisions to do with <b>cash</b> <b>crops.</b> Furthermore husbands appropriate family cash income. Husbands are less likely to use such income for the welfare of the family compared to wives due to different expenditure patterns. Married women in Kenya also have little or no power to change the way land is allocated between food and non-food <b>cash</b> <b>crops.</b> Due to deteriorating terms of trade for non-food <b>cash</b> <b>crops,</b> men have started cultivation of food <b>cash</b> <b>crops</b> with the potential of crowding out women.

At the beginning of the 19th century, these Chinese settlers began to look south to Malacca and Singapore, where gambier and pepper plantations had also been established.|$|E

5|$|Cameroon's natural {{resources}} {{are very well}} suited to agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009. Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major <b>cash</b> <b>crop</b> in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of <b>cash</b> <b>cropping</b> on food {{availability}} and examines the determinants of the proportion of income allocated for food expenditures in the Nyeri district in Kenya. Using a Tobit model, {{the results suggest that}} in general food expenditure allocations suffer due to <b>cash</b> <b>cropping</b> in Kenya as the lump-sum income flows from this may be used for purchases other than food. Food expenditure also suffers when remittances are irregular. On the other hand, earnings from outside employment for married women living with husbands are positively associated with food expenditure allocations. Amounts of non-cash food output as well as ownership of livestock are negatively associated with food expenditure allocations. These findings indicate that lump sum income may not lead to improved welfare of women and children. Thus, there may be social reasons for increasing non-cash food production especially by women, instead of over emphasising <b>cash</b> <b>cropping</b> as now seems to be so in public policy. commercialisation, non-food <b>cash</b> <b>crops,</b> food <b>cash</b> <b>crops,</b> food availability, and non-cash food crops., Agricultural and Food Policy, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the effect of}} <b>cash</b> <b>cropping</b> on food availability and investigates the determinants of household food expenditure {{as a proportion of}} gross income relying on a sample of rural households in the Nyeri district of Kenya. Results from an application of a Tobit model suggest that household food purchases and food availability may suffer as a consequence of increasing <b>cash</b> <b>cropping</b> in Kenya. Husbands favour commercial crops and, it seems, favour non-food purchases. Married women living with their husbands use proportionately less of their gross income to purchase food compared to unmarried women and to those women not living with their husbands. Male bias in food purchased is present, and is exacerbated when payment for <b>cash</b> <b>crops</b> is lumpy. Lumpy cash payments tend to reduce proportionate food purchases by households. We also find that remittances and family size are positively associated with food purchases as a proportion of gross income. Because of household food availability issues, there is a case in many developing countries for reducing policy emphasis on expansion of production of non-food <b>cash</b> <b>crops</b> and a case for greater encouragement of subsistence food production. Increased commercialisation of agriculture can result in reduced availability of food to women and children. commercialisation, non-food <b>cash</b> <b>crops,</b> food <b>cash</b> <b>crops,</b> food availability, and non-cash food crops., Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R

5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, Maryland's economy was {{suffering}} {{from the effects of}} price fluctuations on the world market of its main <b>cash</b> <b>crop,</b> tobacco. Often in those years, the price on world markets was barely above the cost of production, leaving planters with little to show for their efforts. This affected small Protestant planters disproportionately, as many of the larger Catholic landowners had diversified economically. This growing socioeconomic inequality exacerbated underlying religious tensions. Furthermore, the new Governor, William Joseph, who arrived in the colony just before Carroll, immediately entered into an adversarial relationship with the Protestant-dominated lower house of the assembly. Into this powder keg came the news that England's Glorious Revolution had taken place; the Catholic King James II had been deposed and replaced with the Protestant William of Orange. In an attempt to maintain control in the colony, Governor Joseph quickly canceled the session of the colonial assembly scheduled for April 1689.|$|E

5|$|Madagascar's varied fauna and flora are {{endangered}} by human activity. Since {{the arrival of}} humans around 2,350years ago, Madagascar has lost more than 90percent of its original forest. This forest loss is largely fueled by tavy ("fat"), a traditional slash-and-burn agricultural practice imported to Madagascar by the earliest settlers. Malagasy farmers embrace and perpetuate the practice {{not only for its}} practical benefits as an agricultural technique, but for its cultural associations with prosperity, health and venerated ancestral custom (fomba malagasy). As human population density rose on the island, deforestation accelerated beginning around 1400 years ago. By the 16th century, the central highlands had been largely cleared of their original forests. More recent contributors to the loss of forest cover include the growth in cattle herd size since their introduction around 1000 years ago, a continued reliance on charcoal as a fuel for cooking, and the increased prominence of coffee as a <b>cash</b> <b>crop</b> over the past century. According to a conservative estimate, about 40percent of the island's original forest cover was lost from the 1950s to 2000, with a thinning of remaining forest areas by 80percent. In addition to traditional agricultural practice, wildlife conservation is challenged by the illicit harvesting of protected forests, as well as the state-sanctioned harvesting of precious woods within national parks. Although banned by then-President Marc Ravalomanana from 2000 to 2009, the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in January 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of Andry Rajoelina as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following Ravalomanana's ousting.|$|E
