The principle of the frequency modulation Doppler global velocimetry (FM-DGV) is presented in this paper.

The system was made up of a narrow band laser, a light-sheet-generating optics, an iodine <b>cell,</b> a frequency <b>monitor</b> <b>unit,</b> and an image acquisition CCD camera.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to study dose {{non-linearity}} in medical linear accelerators used in conventional radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Open fields, {{as well as the}} enhanced dynamic wedge ones, were used to collect data for 6 MV and 15 MV photon beams obtained from the VARIAN linear accelerator. Beam stability was checked and confirmed for different dose rates, energies, and application of enhanced dynamic wedge by calculating the charge per <b>monitor</b> <b>unit.</b> <b>Monitor</b> <b>unit</b> error was calculated by the two-exposure method for open and enhanced dynamic wedge beams of 6 MV and 15 MV photons. A significant <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> error with maximum values of ± 2. 05931 <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> and ± 2. 44787 <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> for open and enhanced dynamic wedge beams, respectively, both energy and dose rate dependent, was observed both in the open photon beam and enhanced dynamic wedge fields. However, it exhibited certain irregular patterns at enhanced dynamic wedge angles. Dose <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> error exists only because of the overshoot phenomena and electronic delay in dose coincident and integrated circuits with a dependency on the dose rate and photon energy. <b>Monitor</b> <b>unit</b> errors are independent of the application of enhanced dynamic wedge.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} optimal configuration of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> in a hierarchical distributed monitoring system. A hierarchical distributed monitoring system consists of a hierarchy of <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> which are grouped and distributed onto the physical network. The architecture lends itself to parallel processing, reducing the complexity of distributed monitoring caused by factors such as collection and processing of the large quantities of monitoring data. Furthermore, the topology-specific partitioning of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> allow complex, topology-specific events to be monitored and evaluated in a natural and efficient way. The optimal configuration problem is concerned with finding an optimal hierarchical partition of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> such that the total processing cost is the minimum. It is a NP-complete problem. In this paper, we study the heuristics for obtaining near-optimal grouping of <b>monitoring</b> <b>units.</b> Simulation of heuristic algorithms for mesh and hypercube networks are presented. The results suggest further system topology specific heuristics. Although the paper is targeted at distributed monitoring, {{we believe that the}} results can also be applied to other hierarchical control problems in distributed computing.

30|$|The {{use case}} we {{selected}} for evaluating our architecture {{is related to}} road traffic and road condition monitoring in the Finnish highway network. The Finnish highway network has nearly 10, 000 kilometers of road. If <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> consisting of equipment to monitor traffic and weather conditions are deployed on highways for instance on the average every five kilometers, the resulting system has 2, 000 <b>monitoring</b> <b>units.</b> With an average distance of one kilometer, there would be 10, 000 <b>monitoring</b> <b>units.</b> We further assume that these units, which act as PNs, are equipped with 3 G HSDPA modules. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> are coupled with variable speed limit displays and warning displays {{that are used to}} show information to the users of the road. Every <b>monitoring</b> <b>unit</b> acts as a PN for 1 - 100 wireless sensors (LNs) in a local WSN. The sensors are used for monitoring various conditions such as road surface temperature (to detect ice formation), air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, humidity, light, the amount of chemicals applied for prevention of freezing of water, water layer thickness, black ice, traffic volume, speed of vehicles (e.g., using a radar), and accidents (e.g., using video cameras coupled with computer vision). The data from the sensors can be used to adjust the current speed limit and show warnings to the users of the road on the warning displays. We assume that a given <b>monitoring</b> <b>unit</b> uses not only local information but information from sensors in nearby WSNs as input for showing warnings and for determining an appropriate speed limit to optimize the flow of traffic. For this, every <b>monitoring</b> <b>unit</b> is assumed to have on the average 10 outgoing CoAP observation relationships. The mean time between notifications is assumed to be either 1 min or 10 min.|$|R

Very rarely, SUDEP occurs in epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units,</b> providing highly informative data for its still elusive pathophysiology. The MORTEMUS study expanded these data through comprehensive evaluation of cardiorespiratory arrests encountered in epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> worldwide. Methods: Between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 29, 2009, we did a systematic retrospective survey of epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> located in Europe, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand, to retrieve data for all cardiorespiratory arrests recorded in these units and estimate their incidence. Epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> from other regions were invited to report similar cases to further explore the mechanisms. An expert panel reviewed data, including video electroencephalogram (VEEG) and electrocardiogram material at the time of cardiorespiratory arrests whenever available. Findings: 147 (92 %) of 160 units responded to the survey. 29 cardiorespiratory arrests, including 16 SUDEP (14 at night), nine near SUDEP, and four deaths from other causes, were reported. Cardiorespiratory data, available for ten cases of SUDEP, showed a consistent and previously unrecognised pattern whereby rapid breathing (18 - 50 breaths per min) developed after secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizure, followed within 3 min by transient or terminal cardiorespiratory dysfunction. Where transient, this dysfunction later recurred with terminal apnoea occurring within 11 min of the end of the seizure, followed by cardiac arrest. SUDEP incidence in adult epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> was 5. 1 (95 % CI 2. 6 - 9. 2) per 1000 patient-years, with a risk of 1. 2 (0. 6 - 2. 1) per 10 000 VEEG monitorings, probably aggravated by suboptimum supervision and possibly by antiepileptic drug withdrawal. Interpretation: SUDEP in epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> primarily follows an early postictal, centrally mediated, severe alteration of respiratory and cardiac function induced by generalised tonic-clonic seizure, leading to immediate death or a short period of partly restored cardiorespiratory function followed by terminal apnoea then cardiac arrest.
