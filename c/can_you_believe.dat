500|$|... "Hello, Goodbye" [...] was {{selected}} as the Beatles' single for the 1967 Christmas season, their first release since Epstein's death. A dismayed Lennon pushed for his composition [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] to be the A-side instead, but he was overruled by McCartney and George Martin, on the grounds that [...] "Hello, Goodbye" [...] was the more commercial of the two tracks. Lennon remained dismissive of the song; he later said: [...] " [...] was the B side to 'Hello, Goodbye'! <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> it?" [...] Everett writes that, had [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] been the A-side, [...] " [...] would probably have encouraged Lennon to lead the Beatles to new heights", whereas the decision to choose [...] "Hello, Goodbye" [...] was [...] "one more nail in the Beatles coffin".|$|E
500|$|N'Bushe Wright, {{best known}} {{to this point}} for playing the student activist Claudia Bishop in the NBC drama series I'll Fly Away, made a guest {{appearance}} in [...] "Night of the Dead Living" [...] as the cleaning woman Loretta Kenyatta. Wright was cast in the role based on her performance in Zebrahead (1992), a drama film about an interracial romance. A number of songs play on radios in the squad room throughout [...] "Night of the Dead Living". Among the music featured in the episode were the songs [...] "Lay Down My Life" [...] by Carole King, [...] "Texas Slide" [...] by Jean-Jacques Milteau, [...] "N.Y.C (<b>Can</b> <b>You</b> <b>Believe</b> This City?)"

500|$|The {{ceremony}} was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new {{mood in the}} United Kingdom: it [...] "had barely finished before {{it had become a}} byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this {{was the most important thing}} he took away from the Olympic experience: [...] "How important it is to believe in something. You might make a fool of yourself and people will go, 'How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in that, you stupid idiot?' But if you believe in something, you carry people with you." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{theme song}} for Homicide: Life on the Street was {{composed}} by Lynn F. Kowal, who submitted {{one of several}} tapes sent to the producers for consideration. Homicide producers initially had trouble finding the right song, and Levinson ultimately chose Kowal's themes because, {{while most of the}} candidates too closely resembled typical television theme songs, Levinson felt Kowal's song [...] "had that odd quality to it, drums or whatever, and it was very unusual". Music is presented in various ways throughout the first season of Homicide. Some songs are played on radios that play in the homicide squad room, like [...] "Lay Down My Life" [...] by Carole King, [...] "Texas Slide" [...] by Jean-Jacques Milteau, [...] "N.Y.C (<b>Can</b> <b>You</b> <b>Believe</b> This City?)" [...] by Charles & Eddie, [...] "Little Boy Blues" [...] and [...] "Break Up" [...] by , and [...] "Tropic Call" [...] by Mitchell Coodley and Andrew Snitzer, all of which are featured in [...] "Night of the Dead Living". Other songs are more integrated into the show itself, like [...] "Hazy Shade of Blue", a Tor Hyams song that plays while the police raid several neighborhood homes in search of clues during [...] "Ghost of a Chance", and the hymn [...] "The Sweet By and By", which is sung at a church during Adena Watson's funeral in that same episode. Several other songs are featured in episodes throughout the first season, including [...] "Elephant Walk" [...] by The Kings, [...] "The Beat Goes On" [...] by Sonny Bono, [...] "Going' Around in Circles" [...] by Jules Taub, [...] "Telephone Blues" [...] by Sam Ling and George Smith, and [...] "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday" [...] by Freddie Perren and Christine Yarian.|$|E

[...] She developed the same symptoms as her mother, whose death made Ruiz feel that she was going to die also. [...] While she didn't die, she did realized how dependent she had been on her mother. [...] She became determined to succeed in her career and started attending assertiveness-training courses offered at the hospital. [...] The courses helped her to increase her self-esteem, set goals, separate herself from her mother, and feel like she was in control of her life. [...] According to Ruiz, this sense of control was illusory: [...] "I didn't realize that it was God who was in control, I actually thought I was the one in control, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> it?!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Back {{in those}} days [...] it was RCA, our record label then, went over the edge with Virgin Killer. Today {{when you think of}} child {{pornography}} on the net, you would never do something like that. We never did this in the sense of pornography, we did it in the sense of art. It is about the song and the label was pushing the idea because they wanted to get the controversy to help the album sale and you cannot get better promotion than that. Looking back from the band point of view it was never an album cover that we took home to our parents and said, [...] "Look what we just released.." [...] There was always mixed feelings about it and even 30 years later it caused a scandal at Wikipedia because the site for that album was blocked and even the FBI was getting involved.

2500|$|While Fromme {{pointed the}} gun at Ford, several people heard a [...] "metallic click" [...] sound. As the red-robed Fromme shouted, [...] "It wouldn't go off", Secret Service agent Larry Buendorf grabbed the gun, forced it from Fromme's hand, and {{brought her to the}} ground. On the ground, Fromme said, [...] "It didn't go off. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> it? It didn't go off". One of the Secret Service agents shouted [...] "get down, let's go". Secret Service agents then half-dragged Ford away from Fromme towards the east {{entrance}} of the Capitol, until Ford yelled in protest, [...] "Put me down! Put me down!" [...] Ford continued his walk to the California state house, entered, and then met with California governor Jerry Brown at 10:06a.m. for 30minutes without mentioning the assassination attempt until they were through talking business. Ford, who later indicated that he was not scared, concluded, [...] "I thought I'd better get on with my day's schedule".|$|E
2500|$|The win {{attracted}} further {{attention on}} social media because Gun Runner ran the final half mile with a horseshoe caught in his tail: a shoe from Cautious Giant flew loose just as Gun Runner was starting his move. [...] "We watched the tape repeatedly, repeatedly," [...] said Asmussen, [...] "and if you never seen anything before, just wait around. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> that? I mean if we tried to throw one and stick in one's tail as he was standing, still we'd go 0-for-1,000 – let alone at a run, let alone Gun Runner, let alone in the Whitney – and it stayed. [...] how fast he was going , it was held out from him. When he slowed down to walk, then it came into him. We were obviously unaware of it until {{he came back to}} the winner's circle, but not a nick on him. I mean, there's still nails in it." [...] The race improved Gun Runner's rating to 127 in the World's Best Racehorse Rankings August update, maintaining his third place ranking worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Nick Bond of News.com.au {{described}} Dicko's {{criticism of}} Paulini's gold dress as [...] "one {{of the most}} controversial moments in Australian Idol history," [...] while Andrew Bucklow from the same publication labelled it one of the show's [...] "most infamous moments" [...] ever. During Dicko's appearance on The Celebrity Apprentice Australia in 2012, he revealed that [...] "people were virtually spitting on me" [...] after that Australian Idol episode had aired, calling it a defining moment for him because he [...] "became a national pariah" [...] overnight. In an episode of The Celebrity Apprentice and in reference to the gold dress controversy, Dicko made a statue of someone wearing a gold dress with the word [...] "sorry" [...] printed on it. Paulini appeared in the episode to see what Dicko had made and she accepted his apology. In 2014, Dicko told Woman's Day that he does not regret what he said to Paulini, saying [...] "It’s part of who I am and who Paulini is and it binds us together." [...] In July 2017, Dicko apologised again in a pre-recorded message he left for Paulini during her radio interview on Hot 91.1 FM's breakfast show, Dave, Sam & Ash. In the message, Dicko said [...] "I was trying to be nice at the time, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe,</b> but I'm glad that you've gone on to do such great things." [...] After joking that his [...] "cruel little words" [...] turned them [...] "into Australian reality TV's power couple", he ended his message by telling Paulini, [...] "what I want to say is, I'm so proud of you girl, you go get'em." ...|$|E
