5|$|The {{frustrated}} English devise {{another way}} to have Joan executed by the church. English soldiers go into Joan's <b>cell</b> <b>room,</b> rip her clothes and give her men's clothing to wear. They then state she conjured a spell to make the new clothing appear, suggesting {{that she is a}} witch who must be burned. Although suspecting the English are lying, the Bishop abandons Joan to her fate, and she is burned alive in the marketplace of Rouen, though a postscript adds that she was canonized as a saint in the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{quarters}} {{were made}} {{available by the}} town of Willow Bunch; the village supplied three rooms in a house on Central Avenue (now Avenue F South), and Mrs. Mary Anne Capagne agreed to rent to the force space on Survey Road. This location was vacated in 1947. The detachment continued to occupy the three rooms on Central Avenue. In April 1951, The detachment office, single man's quarters, <b>cell</b> <b>room,</b> and married N.C.O's quarters moved to a two storey building on Legare Avenue (now Avenue [...] "F" [...] North). The building {{became known as the}} police building. This building continued to be used until 1966.|$|E

50|$|A small hermitage {{was erected}} here in circa 1211 or 1221, and it briefly housed St Francis of Assisi {{himself in his}} lifetime. In 1235, Brother Elias of Cortona, Minister general of the Franciscans at {{the death of the}} founder, erected a sanctuary, {{refectory}} and five monk <b>cells</b> (<b>rooms)</b> of similar size to the one that Francis himself had used. Monks remained at the site for nearly a century, then the monastery was almost abandoned.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{that houses the}} many electrolytic cells is usually called a <b>cell</b> <b>room</b> or cell house, although some plants are built outdoors. This building contains support structures for the cells, connections for supplying electrical power to the cells and piping for the fluids. Monitoring {{and control of the}} temperatures of the feed caustic and brine is done to control exit temperatures. Also monitored are the voltages of each cell which vary with the electrical load on the <b>cell</b> <b>room</b> that is used to control the rate of production. Monitoring and control of the pressures in the chlorine and hydrogen headers is also done via pressure control valves.|$|E
50|$|The Jackson County Jailhouse {{was built}} in 1870 and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The three-story {{limestone}} structure includes sheriff's office, <b>cell</b> <b>room,</b> exercise yard, a jailer quarters, and prison kitchen. The jailhouse has since been restored and tours are given.|$|E

50|$|After the ion exchangers, the brine is {{considered}} pure, and {{is transferred to}} storage tanks to be pumped into the <b>cell</b> <b>room.</b> The pure brine is heated to the correct temperature to control exit brine temperatures according to the electrical load. Brine exiting the <b>cell</b> <b>room</b> must be treated to remove residual chlorine and control pH levels before being returned to the saturation stage. This can be accomplished via dechlorination towers with acid and sodium bisulfite addition. Failure to remove chlorine can result in damage to the ion exchange units. Brine should be monitored for accumulation of both chlorate anions and sulfate anions, and either have a treatment system in place, or purging of the brine loop to maintain safe levels, since chlorate anions can diffuse through the membranes and contaminate the caustic, while sulfate anions can damage the anode surface coating.|$|E
50|$|Cuba City Jail is a {{historic}} jail located at Cuba, Crawford County, Missouri. It was built in 1908, and is a one-story, rectangular-shaped, concrete block jail structure. It consists of a primary guard space complete with desk and wood burning stove and a rear <b>cell</b> <b>room</b> with pair of hanging iron bunks. The structure was in use until 1954 and today serves as a museum.|$|E
50|$|A {{group of}} women were {{severely}} punished for standing up for another female prisoner. Seventy-four women were pushed into a <b>cell</b> <b>room</b> of barely nine square meters and held there for over fourteen hours.

50|$|After Jailer Joe Wilshire got {{his keys}} {{and came out}} the back door, he was met by two masked men who pulled pistols out on {{him and told him}} to keep quiet. Wilshire shut the door in their faces and tried to escape out the front door, but he was {{immediately}} seized by six to eight armed masked men, who ordered him, under penalty of death, to go with them to the jail door. At the jail, six or eight more of the lynching party were waiting. Wilshire obeyed the men and opened the jail door; then he opened the inside door to the <b>cell</b> <b>room,</b> and finally, Wilshire opened the door of the cell where Benjamin and Mollie French lay.|$|E
50|$|Caustic, fed to the <b>cell</b> <b>room</b> {{flows in}} a loop that is {{simultaneously}} bled off to storage with a part diluted with deionized water {{and returned to}} the cell line for strengthening within the cells. The caustic exiting the cell line must be monitored for strength, to maintain safe concentrations. Too strong or too weak a solution may damage the membranes. Membrane cells typically produce caustic in the range of 30% to 33% by weight. The feed caustic flow is heated at low electrical loads to control its exit temperature. Higher loads require the caustic to be cooled, to maintain correct exit temperatures. The caustic exiting to storage is pulled from a storage tank and may be diluted for sale to customers who require weak caustic or for use on site. Another stream may be pumped into a multiple effect evaporator set to produce commercial 50% caustic. Rail cars and tanker trucks are loaded at loading stations via pumps.|$|E
5000|$|Guzmán {{was driven}} out of the prison by Francisco Javier Camberos Rivera (alias [...] "El Chito"), one of the prison guards, and headed to Guadalajara. In the car, Guzmán sat in the {{passenger}} seat and urged Camberos Rivera that both of them were better off fleeing together, given that the manhunt to re-arrest him would also include his accomplice. When they were outside the city, Guzmán asked him to stop at a gasoline station because he said he was thirsty and wanted a bottle of water. Camberos Rivera got off the vehicle, went into the shop, and bought the water. When he came back to the car, Guzmán was gone. At 11:35 p.m. that day, the prison warden Leonardo Beltrán Santana was notified that Guzmán's cell was empty, and chaos within the prison ensued. The prison staff searched in every <b>cell,</b> <b>room,</b> and closet to no avail. When the news of Guzmán's escape reached the newspaper headlines, the Mexican government vowed to launch a national manhunt to bring him behind bars again and to punish those responsible for allowing him to escape.|$|E

30|$|This section {{describes}} the overall method {{used for the}} dynamic simulations carried out with the software IDA ICE 4 on {{a model of a}} typical narrow office building with perimeter <b>cell</b> <b>rooms.</b> First, a reference building was modelled as a base case, designed to correspond to the energy regulations in the Swedish building code. Then, different design features were studied in a parametric study, and the results were analysed and compared to the base case. The parameters which were analysed were airtightness, insulation levels and thermal mass of the building envelope, glazing and solar control, cooling and ventilation strategies as well as control and installed power of lighting and electric equipment. Finally, the most effective design features were combined as the best case solution and simulated in order to obtain the maximum energy saving potential with a proven technique.|$|R

3000|$|There was an on site {{cytologist}} in the <b>cell</b> <b>room</b> next to {{the ultrasound}} examination room. By using the “Thyroid Cytopathology Bethesda reporting system (Cibas and Ali [...] 2009): definitions, standards and notes”, the specimens were divided into six categories: I: specimen cannot be diagnosed or was unsatisfactory, II: benign, III: equivocal lesions (atypical cells or follicular lesions), IV: follicular neoplasm or suspicious follicular tumors, V: suspicious for malignancy, VI: malignancy. According to the 2010 AACE/AME/ETA “European thyroid nodule diagnosis and treatment guidelines”, Bethesda categories I to IV were classified as “negative cytology”, while categories V and VI were classified as “positive cytology”.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that yeast cell growth temperature may influence the relative virulence of the opportunistic dimorphic fungus Candida albicans. To test this possibility, mice were challenged with C. albicans yeast cells which were grown at either room temperature or 37 degrees C, and their survival was monitored daily. Mice which received <b>room</b> temperature-grown <b>cells</b> died faster. The interaction of glycogen-elicited polymorphonucleated neutrophils (PMNs) with C. albicans yeast cells grown at the two temperatures was examined, because PMNs have been shown to have a critical role in preventing development of candidiasis in normal individuals. In the absence of serum (i. e., nonopsonic conditions), more PMNs conjugated and engulfed C. albicans <b>cells</b> grown at <b>room</b> temperature than those grown at 37 degrees C. However, PMNs were less able to kill <b>cells</b> grown at <b>room</b> temperature than <b>cells</b> grown at 37 degrees C. <b>Cells</b> grown at <b>room</b> temperature also produced abundant germ tubes after engulfment and were thus more likely to escape killing by phagocytes. These results suggest that <b>cells</b> grown at <b>room</b> temperature are more virulent because {{they are less likely to}} be killed by phagocytes and are more likely to disseminate. The possibility that expression of cell surface hydrophobicity is involved in these events is discussed...|$|R
