The conference was held 10 months after the International Conference on Afghanistan in The Hague in 2009, where representatives of 72 countries {{made a commitment to}} further efforts in the country, pledging pledged a stronger military offensive against the Taliban insurgency, to invest in <b>civil</b> <b>reconstruction,</b> to tackle the drug trade and to stabilise neighbouring Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|In October 2008, Cotton {{deployed}} to eastern Afghanistan. He was stationed within the Regional Command East at its Gamberi Forward operating base (FOB) located {{in one of}} the command's 14 province locations, Laghman Province. The overall mission at his duty station - the Gamberi FOB from April 2008 to June 2009, during Operation Enduring Freedom IX - included military logistics, <b>civil</b> <b>reconstruction</b> engineering, government organization, and training from a Joint Task Force. The Joint Task Force at Gamberi FOB included Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA), the 101st Airborne Division, NATO, International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), Interagency Partners, and CJTF-101/Regional Command East Forces. These joint forces sought to secure the citizenry governance, and to rebuild a sustainable economy in order to extend Afghanistan (GIRoA) authority as the legitimate government of the Afghan people. He said his assigned duty was as a military logistics officer of a Provincial Reconstruction Team, where he also helped plan logistical operations for counter-insurgency. His 11-month deployment to Gamberi FOB in Laghan province ended when he returned from Afghanistan on July 20, 2009.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the project}} title “Capacity {{building}} for local craftsmen and small medium enterprises for the sustainable implementation of Decentraliesed wastewater treatment systems (DEWATS)", BORDA runs project offices in Kabul and Herat since July 2012 with projects focused on vocational training.Many years {{of civil war}} and military intervention have brought about a massive destruction of infrastructure {{and the loss of}} capacities for <b>civil</b> <b>reconstruction</b> in Afghanistan. The current growth of the country‘s urban centres intensifies the need for feasible waste disposal solutions and increases the demand for trained staff in the water, sanitation and hygiene sector. BORDA Afghanistan promotes DEWATS through training programs and learning projects. An emphasis is given to glass-fibre reinforced plastic (GRFP) technologies, which reduce the risk and cost of implementation. BORDA provides also School-Based Sanitation (SBS), Health & Hygiene Education (HE) and Health Impact Assessments (HIA) in Afghanistan. So far, such services have been deployed for Schools, Hospitals and Mosques in the provinces Kabul, Bamyian, Balkh, Badakshan, Herat, and Nangahar. The objective of current projects is also the dissemination of Biogas technologies in cooperation with local partner organisations.In order to achieve sustainable coherent development, BORDA Afghanistan coordinates closely with national institutions such as the Ministry of Urban Development Affairs and the Environmental Protection Agency. For the vocational training of Afghan craftsmen and small-scale entrepreneurs BORDA cooperates with its local partners.|$|E

40|$|South Korea {{recently}} hosted {{two major}} international events: the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in December 2011 and the Nuclear Security Summit in March 2012. Both meetings underscore South Korea's ambitions {{to increase its}} involvement in global development assistance and security. The Korean president Lee Myung-bak is pursuing a policy of international contributions with his "Global Korea" national security strategy. Foreign deployments of the South Korean military {{and an increase in}} development assistance are expressions of this policy. However, not only humanitarian reasons, but also the desire for global visibility, recognition and influence play a role in this context. South Korea joined the OECD's Development Assistance Committee at the end of 2009; ten years previously this committee had still classified the country as a recipient state. When deploying its military to foreign countries, South Korea's priorities are non-military assignments such as <b>civil</b> <b>reconstruction,</b> political consulting or medical support. The activities in the field of development assistance and security constitute core elements in the expansion of the country's role in international relations. Considering South Korea’s economic and political development since the state's inception in 1945, its further ascent in global politics cannot be ruled out...|$|E
40|$|Ruin {{pornography}} – {{the photographic}} aestheticization of architectural decay – {{has a long}} history in cinema and television and is linked to spectacles of apocalypse and its aftermath. More recently, these representational tropes have become a photographic genre in their own right, highlighting and, perhaps, celebrating urban and industrial decay. While not necessarily emerging from the same apocalyptic events as their fictional counterparts, the fact that similar kinds of formal representational characteristics are repeated between fiction and non-fiction means that those non-fiction, documentary images are interpreted in the same ways as those of the cities of films such as Oblivion (Joseph Kosinski, 2013), After Earth (M. Night Shyamalan, 2013) and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (Matt Reeves, 2014) (amongst many others). As a consequence, it has been claimed that: [...] . ruin photography and ruin film aestheticizes poverty without inquiring of its origins, dramatizes spaces but never seeks out the people that inhabit and transform them, and romanticizes isolated acts of resistance without acknowledging the massive political and social forces aligned against the real transformation, and not just stubborn survival, of the city (Leary, 2013). This paper will explore the aesthetics of both ruin pornography and post-apocalyptic cinema and television in order to assess the manner in which this form of documentary reportage might or might not succeed in drawing attention to the causes and conditions of urban decay, economic collapse, and the possibility for positive urban and <b>civil</b> <b>reconstruction</b> and outcomes...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} interrogates the positionality of postconflict reconstruction {{efforts in}} Iraq within the broader {{discourse of the}} liberal peace and liberal reconstruction. It examines how U. S. policymakers planned and articulated the reconstruction of Iraq in relationship to historical examples, specifically the cases of West Germany and Japan. It questions how U. S. policymakers understood and utilized the examples of post-World War II reconstruction and the effect those examples had on the policymaking process. This dissertation traces the role historical memory plays in the formation and articulation of foreign policy by examining the use of historical analogies in planning the political, economic, and <b>civil</b> <b>reconstruction</b> of Iraq. It finds that the largest factor contributing to miscalculation in the invasion and occupation of Iraq was not conservative hawkishness, or liberal ineffectiveness, but rather a common mythology shared by {{many members of the}} U. S. foreign policy community, including the Bush administration, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the most prominent Washington think tanks. This common mythology asserts that U. S. and Allied postwar reconstruction efforts in West Germany and Japan were unequivocal successes that led directly to the liberal democracies and neoliberal economies found today in Germany and Japan. This conventional wisdom shapes which policies appeared viable to U. S. policymakers, and resulted in undeserved optimism during the postwar planning for Iraq. This dissertation concludes that the lessons of postconflict reconstruction in Iraq remain contested. Lacklustre results in Iraq have not caused U. S. policymakers to re-evaluate their understanding of the U. S. role in postconflict reconstruction. Rather, the case of Iraq is being absorbed into the existing conventional wisdom, with believers in postconflict reconstruction claiming Iraq was simply planned poorly, or was not met with the kind of resources and commitment that could have led to success...|$|E
