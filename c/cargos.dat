5|$|She {{operated}} {{for several}} years as a merchant ship, and {{was involved in a}} court case that eventually reached the Supreme Court of the United States in 1928. She was laid up in New Orleans, Louisiana, until late 1940 when she was reactivated and refitted to carry American defense-related <b>cargos</b> to Africa and chromium and manganese ore to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{qualified}} {{nature of}} this comment, the operation Beatty had in mind was both important and potentially dangerous. On 6 February 1918, Battleship Division Nine stood out of Scapa Flow to guard the high value Scandinavian Convoy to and from Norway. Twice in the previous year, this convoy—with its essential <b>cargos</b> of iron ore, nitrates, and other chemicals—had been raided by German cruisers and destroyers, {{with the loss of}} 15 allied freighters. To avoid a repeat of these attacks, the British had taken to escorting the convoys with dreadnought squadrons. Still, the possibility existed that the Germans would send out their entire fleet to cut off and annihilate the overmatched battleship squadron, with severe strategic effect.|$|E

5|$|During convoy {{service in}} World War II, Empire Simba {{initially}} sailed between the United Kingdom and North America carrying <b>cargos</b> of scrap iron from the United States. She was bombed by a German aircraft on 1 March and abandoned. She was towed to port for repairs but {{was struck by}} a German land mine dropped in a bombing raid. After six months of repairs, she began sailing roundtrips to Freetown, Sierra Leone. On one return voyage to the UK in July 1944, she collided with another ship in the convoy. After splitting the rest of the war between voyages to North America and Africa, Empire Simba was loaded with chemical weapons in August 1945 and scuttled west of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|However, as {{transshipment}} costs increased, and unprocessed bulk <b>cargos</b> {{decreased in}} volume, {{the economics of}} road transport resulted in a gradual dwindling of traffic on the MSC Railway system, and hence contraction in the MSC Railway itself. Traffic reduction was added to by: the 1969 closure of the CWS Irlam soap works; post nationalisation British Steel Corporation building their own line to Glazebrook to junction with BR; and severe reductions in traffic of ICI's soda ash trains, British Tar Products and reduced domestic coal consumption. With the remaining engines stationed at Ellesmere Port and Stanlow, maintenance {{on the line from}} Irlam through to Partington was halted in late summer 1977, and all through traffic except engineering trains stopped on 21 December 1977. The through line was officially closed to all traffic in 1978, but many of the sidings complexes remained; the last operational section of the MSC Railway, at Trafford Park, closed on 30 April 2009.|$|E
5|$|Other {{new markets}} were to follow. In 1834 Tudor sent {{shipments}} of ice to Brazil along with chilled apples, beginning the ice trade with Rio de Janeiro. These ships typically returned to North America carrying <b>cargos</b> of sugar, fruit and, later, cotton. Ice from traders in New England reached Sydney, Australia, in 1839, initially selling at three pence (£0.70) per pound (0.5kg), later rising to six pence (£1.40). This trade was to prove less regular, {{and the next}} shipments arrived in the 1840s. The export of chilled vegetables, fish, butter and eggs to the Caribbean and to markets in the Pacific grew during the 1840s, {{with as many as}} 35 barrels being transported on a single ship, alongside a cargo of ice. Shipments of New England ice were sent as far as Hong Kong, South-East Asia, the Philippines, the Persian Gulf, New Zealand, Argentina and Peru.|$|E
25|$|Logan Airport is a {{medium-sized}} airport {{in terms of}} <b>cargo,</b> handling 684,875 tons of freight in 2012, making it the 10th busiest airport in the U.S. in terms of <b>cargo.</b> It handles many U.S.-based <b>cargo</b> airlines, including ABX Air, DHL, FedEx Express and UPS Airlines. It also has <b>cargo</b> offices for many international <b>cargo</b> carriers, including British Airways World <b>Cargo,</b> Cathay Pacific <b>Cargo,</b> China Airlines <b>Cargo,</b> EVA Air <b>Cargo,</b> LATAM <b>Cargo</b> Chile and Saudia <b>Cargo.</b> It has two <b>cargo</b> complexes: The North <b>Cargo</b> Terminal, located near Terminal E, and South <b>Cargo,</b> located near Terminal A. Given the airport is the 10th busiest <b>cargo</b> facility in the country, with many companies operating at the airport, it has been recognized that future expansion of <b>cargo</b> from Logan is limited due to constrained physical space for expansion.|$|R

5|$|The Glan-y-wern Canal {{was built}} to connect Richard Jenkins' {{colliery}} at Glan-y-wern with the River Neath at Trowman's Hole, an inlet across the mud flats from the main channel of the river Neath, which was later known as Red Jacket Pill. Jenkins obtained a lease to build it from Lord Vernon on 14 August 1788, but died on the same day. Edward Elton took over management of the colliery, and the canal was constructed by 1790, {{although there was no}} actual connection to the river. At Red Jacket, <b>cargos</b> were transhipped from the small boats used on the canal to larger vessels in the pill, which was tidal. The canal remained in use for about 20 years. Elton became bankrupt and died in 1810 after which Lord Vernon, who had leased the land on which the canal {{was built to}} Elton, placed a distraint on the wharves at Red Jacket and on the barges and it became disused.|$|E
5|$|New England {{businessmen}} {{also tried}} to establish a market for ice in England during the 1840s. An abortive first attempt to export ice to England had occurred in 1822 under William Leftwich; he had imported ice from Norway, but his cargo had melted before reaching London. Fresh attempts were made by Jacob Hittinger who owned supplies at Fresh Pond, and Eric Landor, with assets at Wenham Lake, in 1842 and 1844 respectively. Of the two, Landor's venture was more successful and he formed the Wenham Lake Ice Company to export to Britain, building an ice depot on the Strand. Wenham ice was marketed as being unusually pure, possessed of special cooling properties, successfully convincing British customers to avoid local British ice, which was condemned as polluted and unhealthy. After some initial success, the venture eventually failed, {{in part because the}} English chose not to adopt chilled drinks {{in the same way as}} North Americans, but also because of the long distances involved in the trade and the consequent costs of ice wastage through melting. Nonetheless, the trade allowed for some refrigerated goods to arrive in England from America along with ice <b>cargos</b> during the 1840s.|$|E

25|$|Over 180 {{ships of}} the type had been built before the design was abandoned, 176 of them by William Doxford and Sons.
