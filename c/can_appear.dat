5|$|Animals <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> {{coloured}} due to two mechanisms, pigments {{and structural}} colours. Animals may have both biological pigments and structural colours, for example, some butterflies.|$|E
5|$|Their {{temperament}} {{is described}} as gentle, loyal and affectionate, but dignified and aloof with strangers. They <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> to be a sedate breed and enjoy curling up on the couch, eating and sleeping.|$|E
5|$|As {{the disease}} progresses, {{different}} medical issues <b>can</b> <b>appear,</b> such as oral and dental disease, pressure ulcers, malnutrition, hygiene problems, or respiratory, skin, or eye infections. Careful management can prevent them, while professional treatment is needed {{when they do}} arise. During {{the final stages of}} the disease, treatment is centred on relieving discomfort until death, often with the help of hospice.|$|E

50|$|The boss of 9-Volt's microgames {{is based}} on the Trick Shot mode of Hogan's Alley. Keep the cans up in the air until they land on the small platforms. When the big oil <b>cans</b> <b>appear,</b> hit them until they explode, {{revealing}} classic Nintendo hardware.|$|R
5|$|Bees can be {{severely}} and even fatally affected by pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals that man has {{introduced into the}} environment. They <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> inebriated and dizzy, and even die. This is serious because it has substantial economic consequences for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Elves {{appear in}} some place-names, {{though it is}} hard to be sure how many as a variety of other words, {{including}} personal names, <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> similar to elf. The clearest English example is Elveden ("elves' hill", Suffolk); other examples may be Eldon Hill ("Elves' hill", Derbyshire); and Alden Valley ("elves' valley", Lancashire). These seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys.|$|E
5|$|Most tornadoes {{take on the}} {{appearance}} of a narrow funnel, a few hundred yards (meters) across, with a small cloud of debris near the ground. Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them. Tornadoes <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> in many shapes and sizes.|$|E
50|$|Ping-Pong.A is extinct but the hard-disk {{variants}} <b>can</b> still <b>appear.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shivering <b>can</b> also <b>appear</b> after surgery. This {{is known}} as postanesthetic shivering.|$|R
50|$|Gwisin <b>can</b> also <b>appear</b> to move {{things or}} prank {{you to get}} attention.|$|R
5|$|Other {{terrestrial}} arthropods, such as centipedes, millipedes, scorpions, and spiders, {{are sometimes}} confused with insects since their body plans <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> similar, sharing (as do all arthropods) a jointed exoskeleton. However, upon closer examination, their features differ significantly; most noticeably, {{they do not}} have the six-legged characteristic of adult insects.|$|E
5|$|Some comets are predictable, {{most famously}} Halley's Comet. Yet {{as a class}} of object they remain {{unpredictable}} and <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> at any time. Some have extremely lengthy orbital periods which means their past appearances and returns cannot be predicted. Others may have only ever passed through the Solar System once and so are inherently unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} oxide is TiO2, which exists in three important polymorphs; anatase, brookite, and rutile. All {{of these are}} white diamagnetic solids, although mineral samples <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> dark (see rutile). They adopt polymeric structures in which Ti is surrounded by six oxide ligands that link to other Ti centers.|$|E

5|$|A {{predominantly}} saprophytic species, Morchella rufobrunnea fruit bodies grow singly or {{in clusters}} in disturbed soil or woodchips used in landscaping. Large numbers <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> {{the year after}} wood mulch has been spread on the ground. Typical disturbed habitats include fire pits, near compost piles, logging roads, and dirt basements. Fruiting usually occurs in the spring, although fruit bodies {{can be found in}} these habitats most of the year. Other preferred habitats include steep slopes and plateaus, and old-growth conifer forests. In Cyprus, the fungus is frequently reported from coastal, urban and suburban areas under olive trees (Olea europaea).|$|E
5|$|Although {{bicycles}} and motorcycles <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> {{to be simple}} mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, fork, and two wheels), these parts are arranged {{in a way that}} makes them complicated to analyze. While it is an observable fact that bikes can be ridden even when the gyroscopic effects of their wheels are canceled out, the hypothesis that the gyroscopic effects of the wheels are what keep a bike upright is common in print and online.|$|E
5|$|Further {{dividing}} {{the varieties of}} fancy rats are the many different markings. Pet rats <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> in any combination of colors and markings. The markings are typically {{in reference to the}} patterns and ratios of colored hair versus white hair. Two extremes would be a self (completely solid, non-white color) and a Himalayan (completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet, called points, as in a Himalayan cat's markings).|$|E

As the cans get smaller, they change into a chain of bullets that a soldier is feeding into his gun. In the background are a large red explosion and an airplane falling from the sky...|$|R
50|$|India {{eventually}} does meet Eva Canning, and the {{two have}} a bizarre sexual encounter during which <b>Canning</b> <b>appears</b> to morph into a fish-like creature. Eva confesses to India that she wishes {{to go to the}} sea to be with her mother, which India obliges by taking her to the beach, at which point Eva walks into the water and disappears.|$|R
50|$|However, if the {{negation}} is not emphasised, it <b>can</b> also <b>appear</b> in {{the expected}} position.|$|R
5|$|In {{interstellar}} astronomy, visible spectra <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> redder due to scattering {{processes in}} a phenomenon {{referred to as}} interstellar reddening – similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes {{the rest of the}} sky to have a blue color. This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered {{in and out of the}} line-of-sight.|$|E
5|$|In the {{supplemental}} draft, Mr. Kennedy, who was sidelined with a non-scripted shoulder injury, {{was drafted}} from SmackDown to Raw {{as the first}} (13th overall) supplemental pick. SmackDown obtained Shad Gaspard from Raw as their first (14th overall) supplemental selection. Ezekiel Jackson was ECW's first supplemental pick. Unified WWE Tag Team Champions The Colóns (Carlito and Primo) were drafted from SmackDown to Raw; this left SmackDown without a tag team championship (although the tag team champions <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> on all 3 brands). Brie Bella (from SmackDown to Raw), Charlie Haas (from Raw to SmackDown), and Hurricane Helms (from SmackDown to ECW) were the final supplemental picks.|$|E
5|$|Rare colours <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> {{unexpectedly}} {{in certain}} lines, for instance while an all-white cocker is usually bred by selective breeding of very light golden strains, {{they can still}} appear very uncommonly to parents who are dark colored. A noted occurrence of this happened in 1943, when a grandson of My Own Brucie, Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1940 and 1941, was born all-white.|$|E

5|$|Relations {{between the}} two largest groups, Macedonians and Albanians, are {{sometimes}} difficult, as {{in the rest of}} the country. Each group tolerate the other but they tend to avoid each other and live in what <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> as two parallel worlds. The Roma minority is on its side very deprived. Its exact size is not known because many Macedonian Roma declare themselves as belonging to other ethnic groups or simply avoid censuses. However, even if official figures are underestimated, Skopje is the city in the world with the largest Roma population.|$|E
5|$|Sherlock Holmes Baffled is a {{very short}} American silent film created in 1900 with {{cinematography}} by Arthur Marvin. It is the earliest known film to feature Arthur Conan Doyle's detective character Sherlock Holmes, albeit in a form unlike that of later screen incarnations. The inclusion of the character also makes it the first recorded detective film. In the film, a thief who <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> and disappear at will steals a sack of items from Sherlock Holmes. At each point, Holmes's attempts to thwart the intruder end in failure.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{urticaria}} (SU) {{is a rare}} {{condition in}} which exposure to ultraviolet or UV radiation, or sometimes even visible light, induces a case of urticaria or hives that <b>can</b> <b>appear</b> in both covered and uncovered areas of the skin. It is classified {{as a type of}} physical urticaria. The classification of disease types is somewhat controversial. One classification system distinguished various types of SU based on the wavelength of the radiation that causes the breakout; another classification system is based on the type of allergen that initiates a breakout.|$|E
