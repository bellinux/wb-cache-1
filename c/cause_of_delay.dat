A literature review was done which yielded 72 typical <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay,</b> and a questionnaire was sent to client, contractor and consultant representatives in Malawi. The results were analysed using the Relative Importance Index (RII) and Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficients, which indicated that the top ten <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in Malawi are: shortage of fuel, insufficient contractor cash-flow, shortage of foreign currency for importation of materials and equipment, slow payment procedures adopted by the client in making progress payments, insufficient equipment, delay in relocating utilities, shortage <b>of</b> construction materials, <b>delay</b> in paying compensation to land owners, shortage of technical personnel, and delay in site mobilisation. The <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> are significant and should be given attention by client organisations, consultants and contractors to enable the timely completion of projects in future.

By employing Pareto analysis, 7 major <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> have been isolated. They are: scoop problems, low compressed air, labour shortages, bad ground, flood, power outages and waste pass getting full. The study concludes that, should management concentrate in minimising the 7 major <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays,</b> it will be solving about 80 % of the problems associated with delays in underground lateral development at AGA, Obuasi mine.

During this period, Wada admitted {{that the development of}} A Realm Reborn was a <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> for many Square Enix titles at the time. Yoshida published an updated roadmap for the beta test through launch, indicating four phases of beta beginning in mid-February 2013. He claimed that the team is [...] "adamant the game not be released until it is ready" [...] and that launching too early [...] "would be like at the level of destroying the company". In May 2013, Square Enix announced the release date for the game, along with details about pre-order bonuses and the collector's edition, which includes an art book, a bonus disc with a recap of the original release story, a soundtrack sampler, and several cosmetic in-game items. In June 2013, the company revealed a PlayStation 4 version was in development and due for release in 2014. Early access began on August 24, 2013, with players able to play continuously through to the August 27 launch. Players throughout this period noted continued server issues. Due to an [...] "overwhelmingly positive response", the servers could not handle the number of concurrent players, prompting Square Enix to temporarily suspend digital sales of the game. In light of these issues, Yoshida issued an apology to fans for the game's [...] "rocky" [...] launch and reassured them that fixes were in progress and new servers would be created. A week after launch, the game received a ten-hour maintenance and fresh patches, and all players were compensated with a week of free play time.|$|E

The eleven-day siege had been a [...] "bitter disappointment" [...] to the German commanders; there had been failures of co-ordination, which had led to several incidents of German infantry firing on each other.

Tyng wrote that the delay imposed on the Germans was about [...] although various authorities had claimed anything from no delay to five days. In 2001, Hew Strachan wrote that the German advance had been delayed by [...] because the concentration of German active corps had taken until 13 August. Liège was awarded the French Légion d'honneur in 1914. The effect of German and Austrian super-heavy artillery on French and Belgian fortresses in 1914, led to a loss of confidence in fortifications; much of the artillery of fortress complexes in France and Russia was removed to reinforce field armies. At the Battle of Verdun in 1916, the resilience of French forts proved to have been underestimated.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Construction project delays are {{described}} as a universal problem, {{which has led to}} many empirical studies. However, most of these studies were based on the rankings by respondents, and they were rarely verified. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to explore professional perspectives on the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in the construction industry, where there has been little explicit consideration on this subject in recent decades. Design/methodology/approach: A critical literature review and a qualitative approach was considered for a deeper and fresh understanding <b>of</b> the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays,</b> rather than recycling the existing themes and the risk of a statistically biased approach. A total of 41 interviews were undertaken which included the London Olympic 2012 project team. Findings: In all, 32 themes were identified, which were categorised into 15 categories <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in the construction projects. Almost two-thirds of the main themes are not ranked top 15 <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay.</b> These include knowledge and competence shortage, poor commercial decisions, unnecessary health and safety restrictions, poor risk management and poor space and logistics management. Research limitations/implications: Due to the qualitative nature of the study, the findings might not be considered as representative. Practical implications: The findings provide consideration <b>of</b> the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in the construction industry as seen by practitioners, which should provide guidance to enhance performance. Originality/value: The study contributes to the better understanding <b>of</b> the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> by using qualitative research strategy which is limited in the construction management literature. This study is an empirical investigation into the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in the twenty-first century and it represents an important edition to the body of knowledge within the subject area...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Construction {{delay is}} a common problem in the {{construction}} industry all over the world. Many researchers seeking the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> {{in order to reduce the}} probability <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> to occur. Most researcher identified <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in construction to reduce the possibility of construction project to continued delay. This study is to obtain the holistic delay categories base on Drewin Open Conversion System (DOCS) for the development of a theoretical framework delay and to get the most significant <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in construction industries. There are three main factor <b>of</b> construction <b>delay</b> based on DOCS; input factor, internal factor and external factor. There are 130 items on <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> and it is divided into 31 categories. This pilot survey is distributed to students and fresh graduates that have educational background in construction. The result shown the main factor that contributes to construction delay are mistakes during construction and unrealistic project durations. ...|$|R

With the impacts <b>of</b> these factors, <b>delay</b> is a common problem for construction projects in Dubai. This research aims to identify the most important <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> in Dubai construction projects.

40|$|Construction {{delay is}} {{considered}} one of the most recurring problems in the construction industry. Delays have an adverse impact on project success in terms of time, cost, quality and safety. The effects <b>of</b> construction <b>delays</b> are not confined to the construction industry only, but influence the overall economy of a country like UAE, where construction plays a major role in its development and contributes 14 % to the GDP. Thus, it is essential to define the most significant <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in order to avoid or minimise their impact on construction projects. A detailed questionnaire was developed and used to get input from professionals associated with the UAE construction industry. The perspective of contractors and consultants has been analysed to rank the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> based on their Relative Importance Index. Contractors and consultants were in agreement on the most significant <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays.</b> The research revealed that 50 % of the construction projects in UAE encounter delays and are not completed on time. The top 10 most significant <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> construction <b>delays</b> have been identified by this research. Approval of drawings, inadequate early planning and slowness of the owners' decision-making process are the top <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> in the UAE construction industry.

The actionnaires were to receive, with a punctuality hardly possible in the East, the usurious interest of six per cent., not including one per cent. for sinking fund. Meanwhile, the officers and officials, military, naval, and civil, had been in arrears of salary for seven to fifteen months; and even the Jews refused to cash at any price their pay certificates.|$|E
