5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1975, members of the North Vietnamese Political Bureau paid <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military situation in South Vietnam to plan for their next major offensive. On January 8, {{two days after the}} Vietnam People’s Army 4th Corps had captured Phuoc Long on the northern edges of South Vietnam’s III Corps Tactical Zone, North Vietnamese leaders agreed to launch an all-out military offensive, in order to win the war. Originally the North Vietnamese leaders expected the campaign would last two years, be completed in 1976, and pave the way for final victory. Their key objectives were to bring military pressure closer to Saigon, annihilate as many South Vietnamese military units as possible, and create favourable conditions on the battlefield so that combat forces could be deployed from their current localities.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will pay <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that}} the mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E

25|$|Retail {{designers}} pay <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{front of}} the store, which {{is known as the}} decompression zone. This is usually an open space in the entrance of the store to allow customers to adjust to their new environment. An open-plan floor design is effective in retail as it allows customers to see everything. In terms of the store's exterior, {{the side of the road}} cars normally travel, determines the way stores direct customers. New Zealand retail stores, for instance, would direct customers to the left.|$|E
25|$|In 1846 Kentucky paid <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mexican–American War. Some {{citizens}} enthusiastically {{supported the}} war, {{at least in}} part because residents believed victory would bring new lands for the expansion of slavery. Others—especially Whigs, who followed Henry Clay, opposed the war and refused to participate. The quest for honor was especially important, as a rising generation sought their self-identity and a link with heroic ancestors. The state easily met its quota of 2500 volunteer troops in 1846 and 1847. Although the war's popularity declined after a year or two, clear majorities supported it throughout.|$|E

25|$|Matthew Gravelle {{was cast}} as Joe Miller, DS Miller's husband. Gravelle auditioned {{along with many}} other actors for the role, but Chibnall says that the casting team early on {{considered}} Gravelle their top choice for the role. The producers knew that this was a critical casting decision. Whoever they hired to play Joe Miller would need to step up their acting game significantly in the final episode, so they researched Gravelle's past acting roles and watched as many of his performances as they could find. Chibnall paid particularly <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Welsh language television series Teulu, in which Gravelle had recently played a lead role.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} twelve years, Head devoted {{himself to the}} study of the {{physiological}} basis for sensation. To do this he studied the manner in which afferent impulses subserving sensation are integrated and conducted to the forebrain. He also paid <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> function of the brain in integrating impulses of a different nature and from the various sense organs. Throughout the many arduous and time consuming experiments of this period, Head is described as maintaining his energy and enthusiasm with his vivid imagination suggesting new lines of thought for every problem. Head also recognised that his enthusiasm could sometimes limit his judgement so he always consulted a multitude of peers when conducting a new experiment.|$|E
25|$|The 20th-century Reform rabbi {{and author}} Gunther Plaut argued that Isaac {{was not really}} deceived. Reading the story with <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{personality}} of Isaac, Plaut concluded that throughout the episode, Isaac was subconsciously aware of Jacob's identity, but, as {{he was unable to}} admit this knowledge, he pretended to be deceived. Plaut thus saw a plot within a plot, as Rebekah and Jacob laid elaborate plans for deceiving Isaac, while unknown to them Isaac looked for a way to deceive himself, in order to carry out God's design to bless his less-loved son. Plaut argued that Isaac was old but not senile. In his heart, Isaac had long known that Esau could not carry on the burden of Abraham and that, instead, he had to choose his quiet and complicated younger son Jacob. In Plaut's reading, weak and indecisive man and father that Isaac was, {{he did not have the}} courage to face Esau with the truth. His own blindness and Rebekah's ruse came literally as a godsend. Plaut noted that Isaac did not reprimand Jacob. Plaut concluded that no one, not even Esau, was deceived, for even Esau knew that Jacob was the chosen one.|$|E

25|$|Hokusai paid <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{production}} {{of his work}} in books. Two instances are documented in letters he wrote to the publishers and blockcutters involved in the {{production of}} his designs in Toshisen Ehon, a Japanese edition of an anthology of Chinese poetry. Hokusai writes to the book’s publisher that the blockcutter Egawa Tomekichi, with whom Hokusai had previously worked and whom he respected, had strayed from Hokusai’s style in the cutting of certain heads. Hokusai also wrote directly to another blockcutter involved in the project, Sugita Kinsuke, stating that he disliked the Utagawa-school style in which Kinsuke had cut the figure’s eyes and noses and that amendments would need to be made for the final prints to be true to Hokusai’s style. In his letter Hokusai includes illustrated examples of both his style of illustrating eyes and noses, and the Utagawa–school style. The publisher agreed to make these alterations, even with hundreds of copies of the book already printed. To correct these details the already existing cut blocks would be corrected by use of the umeki technique. The sections to be corrected would be removed and a prepared piece of wood inserted, into which the blockcutter would cut the revised design. Use of the umeki technique can be detected by fine break marks bordering the inserted block. Copies in print of both the original woodblock and those made of Hokusai’s requested revisions survive, printed in 1833 and 1836 respectively.|$|E

500|$|In 1955, Branham's {{career began}} to falter. Even as he became famous, Branham {{continued}} to wear cheap suits and refuse large salaries; {{he was not}} interested in amassing wealth as part of his ministry. His financial difficulties came to a head in 1956 when the Internal Revenue Service charged Branham with tax evasion. The investigation showed that Branham did not pay <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amount of money flowing through his ministry, and that others were taking advantage of him. The case was eventually settled out of court with the payment of a $40,000 penalty. His correspondance also sharply decreased.

500|$|Collins has listed {{two main}} sources of {{influence}} in her writing of The Underland Chronicles. First is her M.F.A. in dramatic writing and her experience as a screenwriter. This writing experience resulted in her structuring books [...] "like a three-act play", and paying <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plot's pacing. Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods came third in [...] "a series of narratives that are interrelated yet can stand on their own", a fact not missed by reviewers. Collins' other source of inspiration was her father Michael Collins, a lieutenant colonel in the United States Air Force, who provided her with advice about the war tactics used in her books, and also instilled in her an [...] "impulse to educate young people about the realities of war".|$|E
500|$|Another, {{considering}} a 1936 {{exhibition at the}} David Jones Gallery in Sydney, found the quality of her work uneven, and while he considered some to be strong, others were criticised as [...] "nothing more than pretty and sentimental". Rix Nicholas's works remained didactic and insistent in their idealism about rural Australia, but following World War II, the country – and its art critics – had moved on. In 1945, The Sydney Morning Herald critic, lambasting Rix Nicholas's works as [...] "crude in colour and poster-ish in presentation", concluded: [...] "There is insufficient spiritual material to fill the canvases of Hilda Rix Nicholas... The bravura, the boldness of these pictures is hardly {{in keeping with the}} actual knowledge displayed. A certain humility, a <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organisation of detail, and less white mixed into the colours would help tremendously." ...|$|E

She paid very <b>close</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> details, something she had always done in her husband's life. Betsy Bloomingdale, one of Reagan's closest friends, stated, [...] "She looks a little frail. But she is very strong inside. She is. She has the strength. She is doing her last thing for Ronnie.

500|$|The first {{characteristic}} was {{a rejection}} of excessive complication in cooking. Second, the cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables and pâtés was greatly reduced {{in an attempt to}} preserve the natural flavors.

Fourth, large menus were abandoned in favor of shorter menus. Fifth, strong marinades for meat and game ceased to be used. Sixth, they stopped using heavy sauces such as espagnole and béchamel thickened with flour based [...] "roux", in favor of seasoning their dishes with fresh herbs, quality butter, lemon juice, and vinegar.
