Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and dexamethasone (Dex) -doped poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) coatings have shown promise to improve chronic neural electrode performance. Here, we employ electrochemical techniques {{to characterize the}} coating in vivo. <b>Coated</b> and uncoated <b>electrode</b> arrays were implanted into rat visual cortex and subjected to daily cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for 11 days. <b>Coated</b> <b>electrodes</b> experienced {{a significant decrease in}} 1 kHz impedance within the first two days of implantation followed by an increase between days 4 and 7. Equivalent circuit analysis showed that the impedance increase is the result of surface capacitance reduction, likely due to protein and cellular processes encapsulating the porous coating. Coating’s charge storage capacity remained consistently higher than uncoated electrodes, demonstrating its in vivo electrochemical stability. To decouple the PEDOT/MWCNT material property changes from the tissue response, in vitro characterization was conducted by soaking the <b>coated</b> <b>electrodes</b> in PBS for 11 days. Some <b>coated</b> <b>electrodes</b> exhibited steady impedance while others exhibiting large increases associated with large decreases in charge storage capacity suggesting delamination in PBS.
