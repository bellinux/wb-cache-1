40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{educational}} programmes for cataloguing scientific-technological heritage {{is the opportunity to}} experiment the <b>catalogue</b> <b>file</b> for different kinds of technical and scientific goods, in order to share and to make available cognitive data regarding scientific-technological heritage by accessing information in a common database. This will be possible through the use of the PST <b>catalogue</b> <b>file</b> realized by the Central Institute for Cataloguing and Documentation of the Italian Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities within the Masters course in Computer cataloguing for the valorisation of cultural heritage of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. Cataloguing is the fundamental tool to support preservation and safeguard activities, but also for the study and scientific research, and it can be used as basic scientific tool to prepare educational and indicative material, specifically designed to spread the knowledge of cultural heritage within different publics. Moreover, cataloguing allows museums to show data regarding the information acquisition activity and the management of recorded cultural heritage through publications, conferences and presentations of results. In particular, cataloguing is a useful tool for valorisation and promotion of cultural heritage and territory: for example, it can support cultural heritage educational activities by allowing to design educational paths and cultural-touristic itineraries. The relationship with the territory is therefore fundamental to disclose not only the significance of the materiality of cultural goods but also the intangible dimension of knowledge, techniques and know-how that lays behind cultural heritage...|$|E

40|$|Data {{distribution}} and replication in distributed systems require special purpose middleware tools for accessing replicated data. Data Grids, special forms of systems distributed over wide-area networks, need to handle data management issues like {{distribution and}} replication of {{large amounts of}} data in the Tera- and Petabyte scale. Replica catalogues are used for cataloguing and locating replicated files in distributed sites all around the globe. We present a novel and administratively scalable approach for distributing a replica catalogue and resolving file location information by using HTTP redirection. HTTP redirection servers managing local file catalogues allow for greater flexibility and local file management autonomy whereas a global replica catalogue provides the necessary mapping of logical files to individual sites. By distributing the catalogues a site can autonomously move files for load balancing within a site without notifying a global replica catalogue. Our approach scales well in terms of catalogue administration to {{a large number of}} sites and file entries and thus establishes a powerful middleware service. We present the design and implementation of our catalogue redirection servers and report on promising experimental results.

40|$|Integrated Rescue System is {{a system}} {{determined}} for co-operation of various constituents in case of crisis and emergency situations. The Law No. 239 / 2000 on the Integrated Rescue System and on amendment of certain codes, is the basic legal frame. The basic IRS bodies are the Police of the Czech Republic, Emergency Medical Service, the Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic along with fire protection units. To unify {{the activities of the}} individual bodies in joint interventions and considering involved risk factors as well as repeated occurrences of joint interventions, the General Directorate of Fire Rescue Service issued pursuant to § 18 of Decree of the Ministry of Interior no. 328 / 2001 Coll. <b>Catalogue</b> <b>File</b> of Type Activities. The aim of this bachelor thesis is to evaluate the activities of emergency medical services and their interaction with target hospital-type health facilities and public health. The thesis focuses mainly on a detailed analysis of four selected Files of Type Activities (STC 06 /IRS, 08 /IRS, 09 /IRS and STČ 10 /IRS). The aim of the thesis is to analyse on base of a special methodology the legislation and standard activities of medical service and public health bodies and to evaluate the level of synchronization of type activities of Integrated Rescue System bodies in connection with pre-hospital care providers, hospital emergency case, and public health authorities. On base of the identified deficiencies a methodology was prepared to complement missing parts and/or to rework parts that no longer correspond to the current legislation. To facilitate quick orientation of Heads of medical groups in joint interventions individual files should contain checklists which shall guide the Heads in a crisis situation and prevent possible omissions. Based on the analysis of all selected files, {{it was found that the}} files STČ 06 /IRS, STČ 08 /IRS, STČ 09 /IRS include medical parts which are in line with the current legislation and the update was not required. As for STČ 10 /IRS, an Emergency Medical Service checklist which is entirely missing has been added. Missing checklists for Heads of medical groups has been added to all of the analysed STČ. These checklists have been designed to be universal, applicable to all files. Missing checklists for Heads of healthcare groups, information sheets to help easier and faster orientation and specimen of lists of persons for fast and easy registration have been designed. The proposed checklists, information sheets and lists of people are attached to the bachelor thesis. The benefit of this thesis is the possibility of practical use of the updated and complemented files. The conclusions of the thesis could possibly be examined practically during the exercise and further interaction with other bodies of the integrated rescue system. It is expected that thesis could be potentially used in practice and tested during the exercise LK EMS...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop a system and {{procedure}} for classifying and cataloguing the textile, costume, and slide collections of the Clothing, Textile, and Related Arts (CTRA) Department at Oregon State University. Investigation was made by letter, personal visit, interview with faculty and curators, and literature research to identify different purpose and use statements classifying and <b>cataloguing</b> systems, <b>catalogue</b> <b>files,</b> and criteria for evaluating the system and procedure. The investigation resulted in the development of a purpose and use statement based on the collection characteristics and user needs; identification of user needs; criteria for evaluating the proposed system and procedure; and the recommended system and procedure. Robert Chenhall developed a system for cataloguing in the computer age. The system contains 91 data fields and can be established as a manual or computerized file. The Chenhall system was adapted for CTRA using 39 of the 91 data fields. Eleven of the data fields were subdivided to meet the expressed needs of the users. Data field definitions and instructions were developed and arranged into a Classifying and Cataloguing Manual. The Manual procedure was tested and revised to meet the established criteria. Sample word lists were developed and reference resources were recommended to maintain vocabulary control. Basic rules were established to provide the cataloguer with a basis for consistency in recording information and use of the system. Procedures were developed and included in the Manual for completing the cataloguing process including instructions for the ledger page, catalogue worksheet, donated objects, label preparation, establishing data files such as Documentation File and History of Ownership, and establishing <b>catalogue</b> card <b>files</b> such as Subject-Index File, Registration-Accession File, and Appraisal File. A recommended test and evaluation of the proposed Subject- Index File was established to determine ease of use after the file is implemented. The CTRA department head will review the test and evaluation results to determine if any further changes are needed to improve ease of use of the Subject-Index File for information retrieval...|$|R

The primary use of AMI is to provide a <b>catalogue</b> of datasets (<b>file</b> collections) which is searchable using physics criteria. In this paper we discuss the various mechanisms used for filling the AMI dataset and <b>file</b> <b>catalogues.</b> By correlating information from different sources we can derive aggregate information which is important for physics analysis; for example the total number of events contained in dataset, and possible reasons for missing events such as a lost file.
