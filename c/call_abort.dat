40|$|Abstract: The paper {{considers}} period overruns {{in control}} tasks with variations in execution time (or response time). A simple model is used, where the {{input and output}} operations {{are assumed to be}} time-triggered, and the execution-time distribution of the task is assumed to be known. Three overrun strategies, <b>called</b> <b>Abort,</b> Skip, and Queue, are modeled as discrete-time jump linear systems and are analyzed with regard to control performance. The analysis is exemplified on an integrator process. It is argued that the Skip strategy has good performance, is simple to analyze, and is easy to implement in real-time operating systems. Some simple extensions are also considered. Copyright c 2005 IFA...|$|R

40|$|Lock-based {{synchronization}} {{techniques are}} commonly used in parallel programming on multi-core processors. However, lock can cause deadlocks and poor scalabilities. Hence, LogTM has been proposed and studied for lock-free synchronization. LogTM {{is a kind of}} hardware transactional memory. In LogTM, transactions are executed speculatively to ensure serializability and atomicity. LogTM stores original values in a log before it is modified by a transaction. If a transaction accesses a shared datum which has been accessed by another transaction running in parallel, LogTM detects it as conflict and restores all data from the associated log and restarts the transaction. This is <b>called</b> <b>aborting.</b> On abort, the costs for restoring data from a log increases in proportion to the data size on the log. However, LogTM selects which transaction should be aborted by their initiated time. Hence, if conflicts occur frequently, it may degrades the performance. This paper proposes a criterion for selecting which transaction should be aborted taking account of data size in each log. In addition, another criterion which takes account of degree of conflict is also proposed. The result of the experiment with SPLASH- 2 benchmark suite programs shows that the proposed methods improve the performance 2. 7 % in maximum...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the availability of}} voice over IP (VoIP) service typically achieved in the current Internet. Service availability is examined using several metrics, including call success probability, overall packet loss probability, the proportion of time the network is suitable for VoIP service, and call abortion probability induced by network outages. Our major findings are: first, packet losses are not rare events, and it is generally worse on international paths. Secondly, network outages make up a non-negligible portion of packet losses. While most outages are short, some are extremely long and make up the majority time of all outages. This implies when a service becomes unavailable, the Mean Time To Restore (MTTR) can sometimes be very high. About {{one third of the}} outages happen in symmetry, and outages tend to occur at the edges rather than {{in the middle of the}} network. Thirdly, although research networks such as Internet 2 has much lower delay and loss than the public Internet, the effect of network outages on both types of networks is almost the same. Finally, we will show that when considering <b>calls</b> <b>aborted</b> due to network outages, the overall service availability drops by a significant margin, from about 99. 5 % to 98 %...|$|R

What follows is a quickening spiral of murder, suspicion, violence and deceit with shocking consequences for the two lovers and everyone around them. Every time someone discovers something about Ray, they end up dead in some accident caused by Ray trying to stop them. The blackmailer is discovered to be Barney and his wife (who have been scamming people by providing kick-backs and then blackmailing them).

As Billy forces Ray and Carla on their knees, Smithy walks in and pulls a gun on Billy. In the fire exchange Smithy is killed and as Ray tries to take the gun from Billy, Carla is shot in the head. Billy leaves as Ray weeps over Carla's body. Ray walks off down the road in shock from the events.|$|R

40|$|Network latency {{can have}} a {{significant}} impact on the performance of transactional storage systems, particularly in wide area or geo-distributed deployments. To reduce latency, systems typically rely on a cache to service read-requests closer to the client. However, caches are not effective for write-heavy workloads, which have to be processed by the storage system in order to maintain serializability. This paper presents a new technique, <b>called</b> optimistic <b>abort,</b> which reduces network latency for high-contention, write-heavy workloads by identifying transactions that will abort as early as possible, and aborting them before they reach the store. We have implemented optimistic abort in a system called Gotthard, which leverages recent advances in network data plane programmability to execute transaction processing logic directly in network devices. Gotthard examines network traffic to observe and log transaction requests. If Gotthard suspects that a transaction is likely to be aborted at the store, it aborts the transaction early by re-writing the packet header, and routing the packets back to the client. Gotthard significantly reduces the overall latency and improves the throughput for high-contention workloads...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Transactional memory {{promises}} to make concurrent programming tractable and efficient {{by allowing the}} user to assemble sequences of actions in atomic transactions with all-or-nothing semantics. It is believed that, by its very virtue, transactional memory must ensure that all committed transac-tions constitute a serial execution respecting the real-time order. In contrast, aborted or incomplete transactions should not “take effect. ” But what does “not taking effect ” mean exactly? It seems natural to expect that aborted or incomplete transactions do {{not appear in the}} global serial execution, and, thus, no committed transaction can be affected by them. We investigate another, less obvious, feature of “not taking effect ” <b>called</b> non-interference: <b>aborted</b> or incomplete transactions should not force any other transaction to abort. In the strongest form of non-interference that we explore in this paper, by removing a subset of aborted or incomplete transactions from the history, we should not be able to turn an aborted transaction into a committed one without violating the correctness criterion. We show that non-interference is, in a strict sense, not implementable with respect to the popular criterion of opacity that requires all transactions (be they committed, aborted or incomplete) to witness the same global serial execution. In contrast, when we only require local correctness, non-interference is implementable. Informally, a correctness criterion is local if it only requires that every transaction can be serialized along with (a subset of) the transactions committed before its last event (aborted or incomplete transactions ignored). We give a few examples of local correctness properties, including the recently proposed criterion of virtual world consistency, and present a simple though efficient implementation that satisfies non-interference and local opacity. ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the event}} of an {{emergency}} on the launch pad or during ascent, a launch escape system <b>called</b> the Launch <b>Abort</b> System (LAS) will separate the crew module from the launch vehicle using a solid rocket-powered launch abort motor (AM), which will produce more thrust (though for a much shorter duration) than the Atlas 109-D booster that launched astronaut John Glenn into orbit in 1962. There are two other propulsion systems in the LAS stack: the attitude control motor (ACM) and the jettison motor (JM). The ACM is a thruster system on the escape tower used to position and orient the capsule. The jettison motor is a solid rocket system used to separate the LAS from the crew capsule. On July 10, 2007, Orbital Sciences, the prime contractor for the LAS, awarded Alliant Techsystems (ATK) a $62.5 million sub-contract to, [...] "design, develop, produce, test and deliver the launch abort motor." [...] ATK, which had the prime contract for the first stage of the Ares I rocket, intended to use a [...] "reverse flow" [...] design for the motor.

As of September 2008, Aerojet has, along with team members Orbital Sciences, Lockheed Martin and NASA, successfully demonstrated two full-scale test firings of the jettison motor.

40|$|A {{launch pad}} escape system for human spaceflight {{is one of}} those things that {{everyone}} hopes they will never need but is critical for every manned space program. Since men were first put into space in the early 1960 s, the need for such an Emergency Escape System (EES) has become apparent. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has made use of various types of these EESs over the past 50 years. Early programs, like Mercury and Gemini, did not have an official launch pad escape system. Rather, they relied on a Launch Escape System (LES) of a separate solid rocket motor attached to the manned capsule that could pull the astronauts to safety in the event of an emergency. This could only occur after hatch closure at the launch pad or during the first stage of flight. A version of a LES, now <b>called</b> a Launch <b>Abort</b> System (LAS) is still used today for all manned capsule type launch vehicles. However, this system is very limited in that it can only be used after hatch closure and it is for flight crew only. In addition, the forces necessary for the LES/LAS to get the capsule away from a rocket during the first stage of flight are quite high and can cause injury to the crew. These shortcomings led to the development of a ground based EES for the flight crew and ground support personnel as well. This way, a much less dangerous mode of egress is available for any flight or ground personnel up to a few seconds before launch. The early EESs were fairly simple, gravity-powered systems to use when thing's go bad. And things can go bad very quickly and catastrophically when dealing with a flight vehicle fueled with millions of pounds of hazardous propellant. With this in mind, early EES designers saw such a passive/unpowered system as a must for last minute escapes. This and other design requirements had to be derived for an EES, and this section will take a look at the safety design requirements had to be derived for an EES, and this section will take a look at the safety design aspects for a launch pad escape system...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the dependability {{study of the}} Beam Dumping System of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the high energy particle accelerator to be commissioned at CERN in summer 2007. There are two identical, independent LHC Beam Dumping Systems (LBDS), one per LHC beam, each consisting {{of a series of}} magnets that extract the particle beam from the LHC ring into the extraction line leading to the absorbing block. The consequences of a failure within the LBDS can be very severe. This risk is reduced by applying redundancy to the design of the most critical components and on-line surveillance that, in case of a detected failure, issues a safe operation <b>abort,</b> <b>called</b> false beam dump. The system has been studied applying Failure Modes Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and reliability prediction. The system failure processes have been represented with a state transition diagram, governed by a Markov regenerative stochastic process, and analysed for different operational scenarios for one year of operation. The analysis of the system results in a safety level ranked SIL 4 in the IEC 61508 standard and 4 (Â± 2) expected false beam dumps generated per LBDS. These results will be validated through a three months reliability run. Several sensitivity analyses have been made providing additional evidence on the importance of the fault tolerant design features and the achieved trade-off between safety and availability. The Beam Dumping System is part of the LHC machine Protection System for which a safety level SIL 3 is required. A simplified model of the LHC Machine Protection System (MPS), including the LBDS and other critical protection systems, has been analysed. Depending on the hazards (e. g. the fast beam losses being the most critical event in the LHC) and their coverage, the safety of the MPS has been calculated between SIL 2 and SIL 4 with about 40 (Â± 6) expected false dumps per year, which is the 10 % of the machine fills. In the context of the MPS the LBDS is one of the safest systems and contributes to unavailability with an acceptable fraction of false dumps...|$|R
40|$|The 2009 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) {{will attempt}} the first {{precision}} landing on Mars using {{a modified version}} of the Apollo Earth entry guidance program. The guidance routine, Entry Terminal Point Controller (ETPC), commands the deployment of a supersonic parachute after converging the range to the landing target. For very dispersed cases, ETPC may not converge the range to the target and safely command parachute deployment within Mach number and dynamic pressure constraints. A full-lift up abort can save 85 % of these failed trajectories while abandoning the precision landing objective. Though current MSL requirements do not <b>call</b> for an <b>abort</b> capability, an autonomous abort capability may be desired, for this mission or future Mars precision landers, to make the vehicle more robust. The application of artificial neural networks (NNs) as an abort determination technique was evaluated by personnel at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC). In order to implement an abort, a failed trajectory needs to be recognized in real time. Abort determination is dependent upon several trajectory parameters whose relationships to vehicle survival are not well understood, and yet the lander must be trained to recognize unsafe situations. Artificial neural networks (NNs) provide a way to model these parameters and can provide MSL with the artificial intelligence necessary to independently declare an abort. Using the 2009 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission as a case study, a non-adaptive NN was designed, trained and tested using Monte Carlo simulations of MSL descent and incorporated into ETPC. Neural network theory, the development history of the MSL NN, and initial testing with severe dust storm entry trajectory cases are discussed in Reference 1 and will not be repeated here. That analysis demonstrated that NNs are capable of recognizing failed descent trajectories and can significantly increase the survivability of MSL for very dispersed cases. NN testing was then broadened to evaluate fully dispersed entry trajectories. The NN correctly classified 99. 7 % of descent trajectories as abort or nonabort and reduced the probability of an unsafe parachute deployment by 83 %.

One example of the usefulness of this system occurred during the descent of the Eagle Lunar Module, when [...] "1202" [...] and [...] "1201" [...] program alarms came from the LM. GUIDO Steve Bales, not sure whether to <b>call</b> for an <b>abort,</b> trusted the experts in the Guidance backroom, especially Jack Garman, who told him that the problem was a computer overload, but could be ignored if it was intermittent. Bales called [...] "GO!," [...] Flight Director Kranz accepted the call and the mission continued to success. Without the support of the backroom, a controller might make a [...] "bad call" [...] based on faulty memory or information not readily available to the person on the console. The nature of quiescent operations aboard the International Space Station (ISS) today is such that the full team is not required for 24/7/365 support. FCR flight controllers accept responsibility for operations without MPSR support most of the time, and the MPSR is only staffed for high-intensity periods of activity, such as joint Shuttle/ISS missions.|$|R
