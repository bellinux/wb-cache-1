25|$|An Avro Ashton, in its six-engined, Olympus testbed form {{appeared}} as the fictitious Phoenix airliner in <b>Cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>Silence</b> (1960), {{based on the}} novel of the same name by David Beaty, a former BOAC pilot. This concerned the takeoff problems of the Phoenix, and the subsequent accident investigation; it was based on two takeoff accidents to the de Havilland Comet.|$|E
25|$|The {{radio range}} system had {{recently}} been calibrated twice and the commission found {{nothing wrong with the}} navigational aids. On the other hand, the aircraft's equipment had been turned to compass instead of antenna. This would have made the beam north of the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> twenty degrees wide instead of four. Although not decisive, it was cited as giving the pilot a disadvantage in navigation. The aircraft's radio range equipment also lacked a marker beacon receiver, due to lack of sufficient parts. This forced the pilots to manually calculate the distance to the beacon. The crew carried out the procedural turn in the right area, but should, according to their route instruction book, have been at no lower an altitude than , thus the aircraft was too low, caused by the let-down being started too early.|$|E
500|$|Both early {{accidents}} {{were originally}} attributed to pilot error, as over-rotation {{had led to}} a loss of lift from {{the leading edge of the}} aircraft's wings. It was later determined that the Comet's wing profile experienced a loss of lift at a high angle of attack, and its engine inlets also suffered a lack of pressure recovery in the same conditions. As a result, de Havilland re-profiled the wings' leading edge with a pronounced [...] "droop", and wing fences were added to control spanwise flow. A fictionalised investigation into the Comet's takeoff accidents was the subject of the 1959 novel <b>Cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>Silence</b> by Arthur David Beaty, a former BOAC captain. <b>Cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>Silence</b> was made into a film in 1960, and Beaty also recounted the story of the Comet's takeoff accidents in a chapter of his 1984 non-fiction work, Strange Encounters: Mysteries of the Air.|$|E
40|$|The Trojan is the {{culmination}} of thousands of engineering person-hours by the <b>Cones</b> <b>of</b> <b>Silence</b> Design Team. The goal was to design an economically and technologically viable supersonic transport. The Trojan is the embodiment of the latest engineering tools and technology necessary for such an advanced aircraft. The efficient design of the Trojan allows for supersonic cruise of Mach 2. 0 for 5, 200 nautical miles, carrying 250 passengers. The per aircraft price is placed at $ 200 million, making the Trojan a very realistic solution for tomorrows transportation needs.

40|$|The {{sound field}} {{produced}} by a supersonic propeller operating in a uniform flow is investigated. The main interest {{is the effect of}} the finite forward flight speed on the directivity of the sound field as seen by an observer on the aircraft. It is found that there are <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> on the axis of the propeller. The semiapex angles on these cones are equal fore and aft of the propeller plane, and depend on the tip Mach number only. The Fourier coefficients of the acoustic pressure contain the Doppler amplification factor. The sound field weakens in the upstream direction and strengthen downstream. Kinematic considerations of the emitted Mach waves not only confirm these results, but also provide physical insight into the sound generation mechanism. The predicted zone <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> and the Doppler amplification factor are compared to the theoretical prediction of shock wave formation and the flight test of the SR 3 propeller...|$|R
40|$|The {{sound field}} {{due to a}} {{propeller}} operating at supersonic tip speed in a uniform flow was investigated. Using {{the fact that the}} wave front in a uniform stream is a convected sphere, the fundamental solution to the convected wave equation was easily obtained. The Fourier coefficients of the pressure signature were obtained by a far field approximation, and are expressed as an integral over the blade platform. It is shown that <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> exist fore and aft the propeller plane. The semiapex angles are shown. These angles are independent of the individual Mach components such as the flight Mach number and the rotation Mach number. The result is confirmed by the computation of the ray path of the emitted Mach waves. The Doppler amplification factor strengthens the signal behind the propeller while it weakens that upstream...|$|R
500|$|The LFR {{also allowed}} {{air traffic control}} to {{instruct}} pilots to enter a holding pattern [...] "on the beam", i.e. {{on one of the}} LFR legs, with the holding fix (key turning point) over the LFR station, in the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> or over one of the fan markers. The holds were used either during the en route portion of a flight or as part of the approach procedure near the terminal airport. LFR holds were more accurate than NDB holds, since NDB holding courses are predicated on the accuracy of the on-board magnetic compass, whereas the LFR hold was as accurate as the LFR leg, with an approximate course width of 3°.|$|E
