5|$|The largest use {{of calcium}} is in steelmaking, {{due to its}} strong {{chemical}} affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving <b>castability,</b> cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries, in which the use of 0.1% calcium–lead alloys {{instead of the usual}} antimony–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys. Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron, and to remove bismuth impurities from lead. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains. Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium. It {{can also be used to}} store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride, from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.|$|E

25|$|Misruns {{and cold}} shuts {{are closely related}} and both involve the {{material}} freezing before it completely fills the mold cavity. These types of defects are serious because the area surrounding the defect is significantly weaker than intended. The <b>castability</b> and viscosity of the material can be important factors with these problems. Fluidity affects the minimum section thickness that can be cast, the maximum length of thin sections, fineness of feasibly cast details, and the accuracy of filling mold extremities. There are various ways of measuring the fluidity of a material, although it usually involves using a standard mould shape and measuring the distance the material flows. Fluidity {{is affected by the}} composition of the material, freezing temperature or range, surface tension of oxide films, and, most importantly, the pouring temperature. The higher the pouring temperature, the greater the fluidity; however, excessive temperatures can be detrimental, leading to a reaction between the material and the mold; in casting processes that use a porous mould material the material may even penetrate the mould material.|$|E
500|$|Plain carbon-iron alloys with {{a higher}} than 2.1% carbon content are known as cast iron. [...] With modern {{steelmaking}} techniques such as powder metal forming, {{it is possible to}} make very high-carbon (and other alloy material) steels, but such are not common. Cast iron is not malleable even when hot, but it can be formed by casting as it has a lower melting point than steel and good <b>castability</b> properties. [...] Certain compositions of cast iron, while retaining the economies of melting and casting, can be heat treated after casting to make malleable iron or ductile iron objects. Steel is also distinguishable from wrought iron (now largely obsolete), which may contain a small amount of carbon but large amounts of slag.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Castability</b> is {{the ease}} of forming a quality casting. A very {{castable}} part design is easily developed, incurs minimal tooling costs, requires minimal energy, and has few rejections. [...] <b>Castability</b> can refer to a part design or a material property.|$|E
50|$|If {{the design}} has {{undercuts}} or interior cavities it decreases <b>castability</b> due to tooling complexity. Long thin sections in a design {{are hard to}} fill. Sudden changes in wall thickness reduce <b>castability</b> because it induces turbulence during filling; fillets should be added to avoid this. Annulars {{in the path of}} flow should be avoided because they can cause cold shuts or misruns. A design that causes isolated hot spots decreases <b>castability.</b> An ideal design would have progressive directional solidification from the thinnest section to the thickest.|$|E

5000|$|Black drum are {{reported}} to mouth a natural bait, so anglers need {{to wait a few}} seconds before setting the hook. [...] Once a big adult drum grabs the bait, it takes off with gusto, and can put up quite a fight. An unsecured rod can easily be pulled into the water. Landing these big fish on light tackle can be challenging, and since drum are primarily scent-based feeders, there is little disadvantage in using heavier line and tackle. A 40-lb braided line with a comparable weight fluorocarbon leader is a good compromise between <b>castability</b> and strength. However, big drum are frequently caught with everything from 8-lb monofiliment to 100-lb braided lines with heavy steel leaders.|$|E

50|$|Aluminium, zinc, zirconium, and thorium promote {{precipitation}} hardening: manganese improves corrosion resistance; and tin improves <b>castability.</b> Aluminium is {{the most}} common alloying element. The numerals correspond to the rounded-off percentage of the two main alloy elements, proceeding alphabetically as compositions become standard. Temper designation is much the same {{as in the case of}} aluminium. Using -F, -O, -H1, -T4, -T5, and -T6.Sand permanent-mold, and die casting are all well developed for magnesium alloys, die casting being the most popular. Although magnesium is about twice as expensive as aluminium, its hot-chamber die-casting process is easier, more economical, and 40% to 50% faster than cold-chamber process required for aluminium. Forming behavior is poor at room temperature, but most conventional processes can be performed when the material is heated to temperatures of 450 - 700 F. As these temperatures are easily attained and generally do not require a protective atmosphere, many formed and drawn magnesium products are manufactured. The machinability of magnesium alloys is the best of any commercial metal, and in many applications, the savings in machining costs more than compensate for the increased cost of the material. It is necessary, however, to keep the tools sharp and to provide ample space for the chips. Magnesium alloys can be spot-welded nearly as easily as aluminium, but scratch brushing or chemical cleaning is necessary before the weld is formed. Fusion welding is carried out most easily by processes using an inert shielding atmosphere of argon or helium gas. Considerable misinformation exists regarding the fire hazard in processing magnesium alloys. It is true that magnesium alloys are highly combustible when in a finely divided form, such as powder or fine chips, and this hazard should never be ignored. Above 800 F, a non-combustible, oxygen-free atmosphere is required to suppress burning. Casting operations often require additional precautions because of the reactivity of magnesium with sand and water in sheet, bar, extruded or cast form; however, magnesium alloys present no real fire hazard.|$|E
40|$|<b>Castability</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in selection of an alloy for cast dental restorations. This study was conducted to assess the effect of recasting of nickel–chromium alloy on its <b>castability.</b> Different percentage combinations of new and once casted alloy were used to produce a total of twentyfive cast samples using modified Whitlock’s method and castings obtained from new alloy were used as control group. <b>Castability</b> value was obtained by using Whitlock’s formula. Results were analyzed using student ‘t’ test. There is no statistical difference between the <b>castability</b> value of the new alloy and the recasted alloy (confidence level 95 %). Within the limitations of the study it is concluded that the <b>castability</b> value will not be affected by recasting the nickel–chromium alloy. Complete castings of any metal restoration are mandatory and to know the completeness of castings of any alloy, <b>castability</b> test is of prime importance...|$|E
40|$|Context: <b>Castability</b> {{has been}} found to be {{affected}} by many aspects of the entire casting system. Very few references in dental literature are available regarding recasting of the base metal alloys. Aims: To evaluate and compare the <b>castability</b> of fresh and reused nickel-chromium alloy and to evaluate the effect of two brands of investment materials on <b>castability</b> of nickel-chromium alloy. Subjects and Methods: For the experimental purpose of evaluation of the effect of recasting of nickel-chromium alloy on its <b>castability,</b> different percentages of new and casted alloy (Nickel-chromium alloy-(Wirolloy NB, Type 4 (Ni- 67 %; Cr- 25 %; Mo- 5 %; Si- 1. 5 %; Mn, Nb, B, C each < 1 %) and two commercial brands of investment materials namely, Deguvest Impact (Degudent; Dentsply Germany) and Bellavest SH (Degudent; Dentsply Germany) was used to obtain 30 samples. <b>Castability</b> value was obtained using Whitlock's formula. Student t-test and one way ANOVA using SPSS 20. 0 software was done. Results: The results of this study confirm earlier works that demonstrate that there is no significant difference in <b>castability</b> values of new and recast alloys. In addition, it also demonstrated, there was no difference in <b>castability</b> using Deguvest Impact and Bellavest SH investment materials. Conclusions: Within the limitations of the study, it was concluded that there was no significant difference found in <b>castability</b> of different percentage combinations of new and once casted alloy using two investment materials. The addition of new alloy during recasting to maintain the <b>castability</b> of nickel-chromium alloy may therefore not be required...|$|E
40|$|Context: Since 1907 casting restorations {{have been}} in use in dentistry. Numerous {{companies}} have been manufacturing and marketing base metal alloys. Gold was {{a major component of}} casting alloys. But alloys with less than 65 % gold tarnished easily and the increase in cost of gold post- 1970 s lead to the revival of base metal alloys such as nickel-chromium and cobalt-chromium alloys which were in use since 1930 s. Aim: This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the <b>castability</b> between an indigenous alloy and an imported alloy, as imported base metal alloys are considered to be expensive for fabrication of crowns and bridges. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the <b>castability</b> (for the accurate fabrication of crowns and bridges) between an indigenous base metal alloy-Non-ferrous Materials Technology Development Centre (NFTDC), Hyderabad (Alloy A) -and an imported base metal alloys (Alloy B). <b>Castability</b> measurement was obtained by counting the number of completely formed line segments surrounding the 81 squares in the pattern and later calculating the percentage values. The percentage obtained was taken as the <b>castability</b> value for a particular base metal alloy. The percentage of <b>castability</b> was determined by counting only the number of completely cast segments in a perfect casting (81 × 2 = 162), and then multiplying the resulting fraction by 100 to give the percentage completeness. Statistical Analysis Used: The Student t-test was used. Results: When the <b>castability</b> of alloys A and B was compared, the calculated value was less than the tabular value (1. 171 < 2. 048) leading to the conclusion that <b>castability</b> between alloys A and B is insignificant. Therefore we conclude that both the alloys have the same <b>castability.</b> Conclusions: Using the above-mentioned materials and following the method to test <b>castability,</b> we were able to derive favorable results. As the results were satisfactory, we can conclude that the <b>castability</b> of the indigenous alloy is on par with the imported alloy...|$|E
