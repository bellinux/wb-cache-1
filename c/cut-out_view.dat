40|$|This paper {{reports the}} design and {{implementation}} of ANAMICA, a three-dimensional (3 -D) medical data visualisation and characterisation system which provides {{a complete set of}} image processing options. Constructions of internal surfaces from total or partial volume of 3 -D data and <b>cut-out</b> <b>views</b> are supported by means of 'volume rendering' as well as object space methods. Arbitrary planar and curved sections of 3 -D data can be obtained and processed subsequently as standard 2 -D images. Volumetrics and a preliminary characterisation of tissues based on histograms are also supported. A window based user-interface provides convenient access to all these options. </span...|$|R
5000|$|In effect, the [...] "device" [...] was {{essentially}} a complete blow-back pistol minus a receiver/grip using the short [...] "barrel" [...] of the device {{to fit into the}} longer chamber of the M1903 rifle. The mechanism was fed by a long 40-round magazine sticking perpendicularly out of the rifle at a 45-degree angle to the top right, and could be reloaded by inserting a new magazine. Each magazine had <b>cut-out</b> <b>viewing</b> slots facing aft so the rifleman could observe the number of unfired rounds remaining. The system required an ejection port to be cut into {{the left side of the}} M1903 rifle's receiver and the adjacent stock cut away to allow clearance for spent cartridges being thrown from the action. Sear, trigger, and magazine cut-off also required modifications which did not limit the ability of Mark I receivers to function in the normal bolt action mode.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mausoleum}} {{consists of}} five angled galleries that are positioned around an open courtyard and two reflection pools. [...] The five galleries are St. Anthony, Our Lady, Holy Trinity, Sacred Heart and the Archangel Gabriel. [...] Each gallery {{is separated from}} one another by using different types of stone and ceiling finishes adorned with handcrafted religious mosaics to offer choice for buyers. The blue stone pavement of the gallery, ceramic mosaics and the distinct palette of material finishes elude a welcoming and comfortable presence to visitors. Precast concrete panels engineered by Gutterridge Haskins & Davey, [...] are specially shaped into “wings” to form the external colonnades of the mausoleum to provide maximum lighting and exposure to prevailing winds. [...] Also, the series of semi-enclosed galleries due to <b>cut-out</b> profiles provides <b>views</b> to the interstitial gardens and water features for all galleries. Subsequently, a play {{of light and shadow}} is formed across the interior spaces from the cut-outs, inviting contemplation to visitors. (book)The mausoleum houses a total of 1398 casket spaces [...] that are distributed throughout three different types of rooms - single, pair and family rooms. [...] Quality Italian marble adorned crypts are positioned next to the sea of coloured glass windows to allow the caskets to bathe under beautifully coloured lights throughout different times of the day. [...] Moreover,families who desire to be buried together are able to go for an individual room with a burial space of up to 10 family members at one particular section of the mausoleum. [...] Furthermore, statues, mementoes and special keepsakes are displayed in the fully lockable, glass fronted personal memory showcases.|$|R
