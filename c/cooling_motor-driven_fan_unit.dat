At Petone, ventilation was a rather primitive affair, relying on windows and roof vents, as well as circular stoves placed at strategic locations around the buildings. This had replaced an earlier and even more basic system of steam pipes around the machines. At Hutt, a far more effective system was installed by Messrs. A. & T. Burt, which involved a series of pipes throughout the buildings through which, with the aid of <b>motor-driven</b> <b>fans,</b> <b>cool</b> air from outside or warm air from steam boilers could be circulated.|$|R

50|$|There exist {{different}} types of PAPR units for different working environments. Regardless of type, a PAPR consists of (1) some kind of headgear (mask or hood), (2) a powered (<b>motor-driven)</b> <b>fan</b> which forces incoming air through (3) a filter (or multiple filters) for delivery to the user for breathing, and (4) a battery or other power source. The mask may be hard and tight-fitting or flexible and loose-fitting. (The former affords {{a higher level of}} protection, but is less comfortable.) The fan, filter, and power-pack may be carried around freely by the user, often secured by a belt around the waist. Alternatively, with certain units, the air is fed to the user via lengthy tubing while the fans and filters are remotely mounted.|$|R
40|$|Here let us {{describe}} the trends in heatsinks focusing on those for personal computers. At first, the heat generation rate itself of CPUs {{was small and}} hence the heat density was low necessitating no heatsinks, and conventionally the heat was dissipated into the printed circuit board, {{taking advantage of the}} CPU package made of plastics, through the socket. Then, as CPUs upgraded in integration scale and the design rule for circuit patterns improved in preciseness together with the increasing clock frequency, the heat generation rate continued to upsurge. Consequently, a need for cool-ing using heatsinks arose, and heatsinks based on extru-sions and die-castings were employed for desktop PCs. Later on, as the heat generation rate of CPUs increased higher, these blower-less air-cooling devices were found to be insufficient, so that forced air-cooling using a <b>motor-driven</b> <b>fan</b> was introduced, and this cooling method continues to be used up until now experiencing many improvements 2), 3). On the other hand, with respect to notebook PCs, the heat was at first diffused over the entire casing using its aluminum sheet metal to be naturally dissipated into the air. In the meantime, in 1993, heatpipe was combined with the casing to improve the heat-diffusing perfor-mance, and further, <b>motor-driven</b> <b>fan</b> was introduced thus achieving performance improvements year by year. As it is now some CPUs generate a heat rate of more than 100 W, and those developed for notebook PCs in excess of 30 W. Moreover, the heat generation rate of other devices such as GPU now exceeds 10 W, producing a tendency toward increased temperature within the casing. As described above, the heatsinks of today are used in many crucial places where extremely high performance is required. Accordingly, it is essential for heatsinks to maxi-mize the fin efficiency by adopting heatpipes that outper- 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This {{paper was}} {{to study the}} clothes dryer using waste heat from a split type air {{conditioner}} with a capacity of 12, 648 btu/h. The drying chamber had a minimum cross section area {{with the size of}} 0. 5 x 1. 0 m 2. The chamber was constructed by sailcloth and was inside folded with aluminium foil. Then, it was connected to the condensing unit of an air conditioner. The experiment was carried out in two aspects which were the clothes drying with and without auxiliary <b>fan</b> <b>unit.</b> The results showed that the drying rate of clothes in the chamber installed with and without auxiliary <b>fan</b> <b>unit</b> were 2. 26 and 1. 1 kg/h, respectively. In case of the chamber installed with a auxiliary <b>fan</b> <b>unit,</b> the additional power of 0. 011 kWh was consumed and the drying rate was higher than that of clothes drying without auxiliary <b>fan</b> <b>unit.</b> Without auxiliary <b>fan</b> <b>unit</b> installation, no energy was required but there was a portion of hot air leaks away through the punctured holes at the wall of the drying chamber, hence the drying rate was dropped below. The drying rate of clothes drying using waste heat was higher than natural indoor drying and commercial dryer which their drying rate were 0. 17 and 1. 9 kg/h, respectively. It was noted that the COP of the air conditioner did not change during the operating of clothes drying. Keywords—Drying Rate, Clothes Dryer, COP, Air Conditioner. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Alluvial fans in arid and {{semi-arid}} regions {{can provide}} important evidence of geomorphic and climatic changes, which reveal {{the evolution of}} the regional tectonic activity and environment. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing technology, which is sensitive to geomorphic features, {{plays an important role in}} quickly mapping alluvial <b>fan</b> <b>units</b> of different ages. In this paper, RADARSAT- 2 (Canada’s C-band new-generation radar satellite) and ALOS-PALSAR (Japan’s advanced land observing satellite, phased array type L-band SAR sensor) data, acquired over the Shule River Alluvial Fan (SRAF), are used to extract backscattering coefficients, scattering mechanism-related information, and polarimetric characteristic parameters. The correlation between these SAR characteristic parameters and <b>fan</b> <b>units</b> of the SRAF of different ages was studied, and the spatial distribution of <b>fan</b> <b>units,</b> since the Late Pleistocene, was extracted based on the Maximum Likelihood classification method. The results prove that (1) some C-band SAR parameters can describe the geomorphic characteristics of alluvial <b>fan</b> <b>units</b> of different ages in the SRAF; (2) SAR data can be used to map the SRAF’s surface between the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene and to extract the spatial distribution of fan units; and (3) the time-spatial distribution of the SRAF can provide valuable information for tectonic and paleoenvironmental research of the study area...|$|R

5000|$|The General Electric X353-5 was an unusual, high bypass ratio, liftfan system {{developed}} for the Ryan XV-5 Vertifan V/STOL research aircraft [...] (known earlier as the VZ-11). Two General Electric J85-5 turbojets were used for propulsion in wing-borne flight. During lift, the exhaust from these turbojets was diverted through ducting {{to a pair of}} vertically mounted turbine/fan units buried in the aircraft wings (one in the starboard wing, the other in the port wing). These turbine/fan units were similar in concept to the aft <b>fan</b> <b>units</b> on the General Electric CJ805 -23, the main difference being that the turbine blades of the X353-5 were outboard of the fan, rather than inboard. Each engine supplied half the exhaust gas needed to drive each <b>fan</b> <b>unit.</b> A cross-over duct kept both fans turning uniformly in the event of either engine failing. The aircraft also had a smaller turbine/fan mounted in the aircraft nose, which was used to control pitch. This pitch fan was similar in design to the main <b>fan</b> <b>units</b> and utilised 10.5% of the gas generator exhaust gas flow. Beneath each fan was a series of spanwise exit louvres, ganged together, which were used to vector the fan thrust in lift mode. Effectively, the bypass ratio was 12.16:1 in lift mode.|$|R
