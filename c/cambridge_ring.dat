50|$|Golitsyn's {{reliability}} {{remains a}} controversial subject and as such, {{there is little}} certainty {{of the number of}} agents he assigned to the <b>Cambridge</b> spy <b>ring.</b> To add to the confusion, when Blunt finally confessed, he named several other people as having been recruited by him.|$|R
2500|$|He appears {{several times}} in the book Spycatcher, which he hoped would clear the air over suspicions about his wartime role and the {{possibility}} he was involved in the <b>Cambridge</b> spy <b>ring.</b> He was still able to enter the premises of MI5 as a former employee and was aware of suspicions there was a [...] "mole" [...] in MI5, but felt himself above suspicion. While Edward Heath was Prime Minister, Rothschild was a frequent visitor to Chequers, the Prime Minister's country residence. Throughout his life, he was a valued adviser on intelligence and science to both Conservative and Labour Governments. In 1993, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, six retired KGB colonels, including Yuri Modin, the spy ring's handler, alleged Rothschild was the [...] "Fifth Man". Modin claimed, [...] "Rothschild was the key to most of the <b>Cambridge</b> <b>ring's</b> penetration of British intelligence. 'He had the contacts,' Modin noted. 'He was able to introduce Burgess, Blunt and others to important figures in Intelligence such as Stewart Menzies, Dick White and Robert Vansittart in the Foreign Office...who controlled Mi-6." [...] Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, in The Mitrokhin Archives, make no mention of Rothschild as a Soviet agent and instead identify John Cairncross as the Fifth Man.|$|R

50|$|Chesterton Road (part of the A1303) is a road in {{the north}} of Cambridge, England. The southwestern part of the road is known as Chesterton Lane. This links with Northampton Street at the {{junction}} with Castle Street to the northwest and Magdalene Street leading southeast across the River Cam into central Cambridge. At the northeastern end there is a roundabout, linking with Elizabeth Way (the A1134) to the south, continuing <b>Cambridge's</b> inner <b>ring</b> road to the east. Halfway along Chesterton Road there is a major junction with Victoria Road northwest and Milton Road northeast (both part of the A1134) and Victoria Avenue over the Cam on Victoria Avenue Bridge to the south. Chesterton Lane and Chesterton Road form {{the northern part of the}} <b>Cambridge</b> inner <b>ring</b> road and thus have heavy traffic at times.|$|R

50|$|In 1978 Hopper {{worked with}} Hermann Hauser and Chris Curry, founders of Acorn Computers Ltd; Orbis became a {{division}} of Acorn in 1979 and continued {{to work with the}} <b>Cambridge</b> <b>Ring.</b> While at Acorn, Hopper helped to design some of the chips for the BBC Micro. When Acorn was acquired by Olivetti in 1985, Hauser became vice-president for research at Olivetti, in which role he co-founded the Olivetti Research Laboratory in 1986 with Hopper; Hopper became its managing director.|$|E
50|$|Several {{people have}} been {{suspected}} of being additional members of the group; John Cairncross (cryptonym: Liszt) was identified as such by Oleg Gordievsky, although many others have also been accused of membership in the <b>Cambridge</b> <b>ring.</b> Both Blunt and Burgess {{were members of the}} Cambridge Apostles, an exclusive and prestigious society based at Trinity and King's Colleges. Cairncross was also an Apostle. Other Apostles accused of having spied for the Soviets include Michael Whitney Straight and Guy Liddell.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{experimental}} and early commercial LAN technologies {{were developed in}} the 1970s. <b>Cambridge</b> <b>Ring</b> was developed at Cambridge University starting in 1974. Ethernet was developed at Xerox PARC in 1973 - 1975, and filed as [...] In 1976, after the system was deployed at PARC, Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs published a seminal paper, [...] "Ethernet: Distributed Packet-Switching for Local Computer Networks". ARCNET was developed by Datapoint Corporation in 1976 and announced in 1977. It had the first commercial installation in December 1977 at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York.|$|E
25|$|When Anthony Blunt was unmasked as {{a member}} of the <b>Cambridge</b> Spy <b>ring</b> in 1964, Rothschild was {{questioned}} by Special Branch (though Blunt was not publicly identified as a Soviet agent until 1979 in the House of Commons by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher). Rothschild was cleared, and continued working on projects for the British government.|$|R

The Washington Post named The Trinity Six as one of the Notable Books of 2011. The film rights were optioned by Scott Stuber at Bluegrass Films. Cumming has adapted the novel into a screenplay.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Cambridge</b> <b>Ring</b> was an {{experimental}} {{local area network}} architecture developed at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge starting in 1974 and continuing into the 1980s. It was a ring network with a theoretical limit of 255 nodes (though such a large number would have badly affected performance), around which cycled a fixed number of packets. Free packets would be [...] "loaded" [...] with data by a machine wishing to send, marked as received by the destination machine, and [...] "unloaded" [...] on return to the sender; thus in principle there could be as many simultaneous senders as packets. The network ran over twin twisted-pair cabling (plus a fibre-optic section).|$|E
50|$|A {{wide range}} of {{different}} local area network technologies were developed in the early 1970s, of which one, the <b>Cambridge</b> <b>Ring</b> had demonstrated the potential of a token passing ring topology, and many teams worldwide began working on their own implementations. At the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory Werner Bux and Hans Müller in particular worked on the design and development of IBM's Token Ring technology, while early work at MIT led to the Proteon 10 Mbit/s ProNet-10 Token Ring network in 1981the same year that workstation vendor Apollo Computer introduced their proprietary 12 Mbit/s Apollo Token Ring (ATR) network running over 75-ohm RG-6U coaxial cabling. Proteon later evolved a 16 Mbit/s version that ran on unshielded twisted pair cable.|$|E
5000|$|Wheeler married Joyce Blackler in August 1957, who herself used EDSAC {{for her own}} {{mathematical}} investigations as {{a research}} student from 1955. He became a Fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge in 1964 and formally retired in 1994, although he continued to be {{an active member of}} the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory until his death. In 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2003, he was named a Computer History Museum Fellow Award recipient [...] "for his invention of the closed subroutine, and for his architectural contributions to ILLIAC, the <b>Cambridge</b> <b>Ring,</b> and computer testing."

50|$|An Englishman Abroad is a 1983 BBC {{television}} drama film, {{based on}} {{the true story of}} a chance meeting of actress Coral Browne, with Guy Burgess (Alan Bates), a member of the <b>Cambridge</b> spy <b>ring</b> who spied for the Soviet Union while an officer at MI6.

50|$|Tudor-Hart was {{instrumental}} in recruiting both the <b>Cambridge</b> Spy <b>ring</b> which damaged British intelligence from World War II through to their discovery in the late 1960s.Whilst working as a photographer she also acted as a courier.

5000|$|Yuri Modin (November 8, 1922 in Suzdal [...] - [...] 2007 in Moscow) was the KGB {{controller}} for the [...] "Cambridge Five" [...] from 1948 to 1951, {{during which}} Donald Duart Maclean {{was said to}} have passed atomic secrets to the Soviets. In 1951, Modin arranged the defections of Maclean and Guy Burgess. Modin's predecessors in control of the damaging <b>Cambridge</b> spy <b>ring</b> were executed during Stalin's Great Purge.|$|R
