Rietveld analysis show that the NMC 442 c lattice parameter gradually increases until x = 0. 47 (4. 03 V) and then decreases during the first charge. The decreasing trend of the c lattice parameter with time during the hold at 4. 7 V and 4. 9 V agrees very well with the change of current. Overall the structural changes appear highly reversible when 4. 7 V is used as an upper cutoff voltage, even following a 10 h hold at 4. 7 V. However, the electrode/electrolyte changes dramatically when charged and held at 4. 9 V. There is a significant drop in background attributed to electrolyte decomposition and an unexpected increase in the a lattice parameter is noted after the 4. 9 V hold. Therefore, the electrolyte system used is both beneficial for in-situ neutron diffraction studies and battery performance until 4. 7 V, but appears to degrade in combination with the electrode at 4. 9 V.

This EC ring-opening reaction is unavoidable once the cathode material contacts with the electrolyte because this process is purely chemical rather than electrochemical in nature. The -OH and -F adsorbed species display a passivation effect on the surface against the reaction with EC, but the extent is limited except for the case of -OH bonded to a surface transition metal atom.

High interatomic level conductivity of about 20 S m(- 1) was evidenced and attributed to the contribution of the extended states and to a Brownian motion of the charge carriers with mean free path similar to the lattice constant. The ratio between sample and local conductivity is more than 10 (5). The large conductivity drop of 3 to 4 orders of magnitude is observed from the particle to the cluster scale.

The conductivity drop from the cluster to the sample scale is comparatively very small, owing to the dense architecture of the NMC sample in which the spherical clusters are very piled up on each other...|$|R
40|$|This thesis details {{electrical}} and physical measurements of pulsed laser deposition-applied thin film coatings of Alumina, Ceria, and Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) on a LiNi 0. 5 Mn 0. 3 Co 0. 2 <b>O</b> 2 (<b>NMC)</b> cathode in a Lithium ion battery. Typical NMC cathodes exhibit {{problems such as}} decreased rate performance and an opportunity for increased capacity exists by raising operation voltage beyond the electrolyte stability window. Very thin (~ 10 nm) coatings of stable oxides provide a pathway to solve both problems. As well, the electrochemical impedance spectra of the uncoated and coated cells were measured after different numbers of cycles to reveal the property variation in the cathode. Further understanding of the mechanism of rate performance enhancement and chemical protection by thin oxide coatings will continue to improve battery capability and open up new applications. Ceria-coated Li-NMC cells show the best capacity and rate performance in battery testing. Through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the surface film resistance was found to remain stable or even drop slightly after repeated cycling at high voltage. CeO 2 is proposed as a coating for Lithium ion battery cathodes owing to its high chemical stability and the demonstrated but not yet well understood electrical conductivity. Alumina-coated cathode shows comparable performance {{as that of the}} uncoated cell in the early stage of the test, but through the course of testing the rate capability and recoverable capacity is improved. This is possibly due to Al 2 O 3 ?s well-known abilities as HF scavenger and chemically inert nature. YSZ-coated cathode performs worse than the uncoated ones in terms of capacity, rate capability, and EIS-related figures of merit. The reason for the poor performance is not yet known, and repeatability tests are under way to verify performance. High voltage cycling reveals no obvious difference in irreversible loss between the coated or uncoated cells. The reason for the lack of distinction could be the relatively small percentage of surface coating compared to the thick doctor-blade processed cathode layer...|$|R
40|$|Li 1. 2 Ni 0. 15 Mn 0. 55 Co 0. 1 <b>O</b> 2 (LMR <b>NMC)</b> is {{synthesized}} by solution {{combustion method}} followed by LiF coating onto LMR NMC by solid state synthesis. The electrochemical {{performance of the}} pristine LMR NMC and corresponding F-doped samples as cathodes for Lithium ion Batteries (LIBs) are investigated by galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling and impedance spectroscopy. The fluorine doped cathodes deliver high capacity of 300 mAh g(- 1) at C/ 10 rate (10 - 20 % greater than the pristine LMR NMC cathodes), have high discharge voltage plateau (> 0. 25 V) and low charge voltage plateau (0. 2 - 0. 4 V) compared to pristine LMR NMC cathodes. Beside, irreversible capacity, voltage fade, capacity loss are significantly reduced in-relation to the pristine LMR NMC electrodes. LiF coating onto LMR NMC, partially replaces M-O bonds of the material by M-F bonds, thus increasing the interfacial and structural stability. Besides, the manuscript describes possible replacement of aluminium current collector with 3 D carbon fiber current collector which delivers high capacity of > 200 mAh g(- 1) at 1 C rate, good capacity retentions for over 200 cycles. The study opens a possibility for LMR NMC cathode material which has almost double the capacity of currently used cathodes, can be a possible substitute cathode for LIBs used in electric vehicles...|$|R
40|$|Lithium ion {{battery is}} the {{dominant}} secondary storage technology for portable electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices and grid storage. While it has gained widespread acceptance, current generation battery materials are limited by the expensive and often toxic components, and safety concerns, and, still cannot meet projected storage requirements for future applications. A majority of studies rely on traditional synthesis techniques {{similar to those used}} for large scale manufacturing for development and investigation of new materials. Our work takes an alternate approach of harnessing thin film technology that has been extensively developed for semiconductor-related research. The thesis focuses on the investigation of the next generation environmentally friendly and low cost battery material using thin film- based studies. A better understanding and optimization using thin film techniques aids the development of traditional processes for bulk batteries and also paves a way for future all thin film-based battery for portable electronics. The work focuses on Mn-based materials because of its low cost and non-toxic nature. A unique one step deposition processes have been developed and demonstrated using the growth and analysis of epitaxial and highly textured Li(NixMnyCo 1 -x-y) <b>O</b> 2 (<b>NMC)</b> thin film on stainless steel with a thin gold buffer layer. The NMC thin film cathodes gave a high capacity of 167 mAh. g^- 1 and 125 mAh. g^- 1 at 0. 1 C and 0. 5 C respectively. Another promising next generation material Li 2 MnO 3 has also been investigated. An unique process to extract Li 2 O during synthesis has been developed to activate this material directly during deposition. Li 2 MnO 3 cathodes with capacity of 225 mAh. g^- 1 were synthesized by tuning growth conditions appropriately. Another Mn based chemistry, commonly referred to as Li-rich oxide, has been investigated. Nano-domain and composite model structures have been developed to investigate unresolved questions about the microstructure of the films. It has been demonstrated that a nano-domain model best matches with the characteristic electrochemical properties of Li-rich cathodes with a demonstrated capacity of 293 mAh g^- 1 at 0. 05 C. Further study has been carried out to explore optimum composition and structure for Li-rich based thin film cathodes. Composition variation experiments indicate that the 50 : 50 deposition schemes gave the highest capacity. Moreover, the results indicate a strong correlation between Li 2 MnO 3 domain size on the capacity of the Li rich electrode. A study to investigate correlation between oxygen stoichiometry and microstructure on behavior of Li 2 MnO 3 showed strong inter-correlation. It shows that Li rich cathodes performed the best when deposited at low oxygen partial pressure while Li 2 MnO 3 required a moderate partial pressure for optimum capacity. Finally Li 3 PO 4 and LiPON electrolytes have been investigated for all solid state battery development. An electrolyte coating on top of a NMC cathode film resulted in significant improvement to the observed capacity. Li 3 PO 4 coated cathodes demonstrated a high capacity of ~ 80 ?Ah/?m. cm^ 2 at 0. 75 ?A. cm^- 2, compared to 65 ?Ah/?m. cm^ 2 that was observed in bare NMC. This work contributes to the implementation of all solid state batteries using thin film approaches with great potentials for various applications such as integrated circuits, portable medical devices and space applications...|$|R
