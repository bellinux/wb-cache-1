25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

500|$|During {{recording}} {{sessions for}} their upcoming album, vocalist Gregg Allman was {{also working on}} his solo album, Laid Back, and the sessions occasionally overlapped. Chuck Leavell was asked to play piano for Allman's solo album, and gradually found himself contributing to the Allman Brothers as well. Allman and Betts took turns caring for Oakley, taking him outdoors to places like the zoo {{to keep him from}} drinking as much. [...] "Time and time again, I have sat and wondered, 'God, what in the hell <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done, what could have anybody have done, to help him?'" [...] said Allman. Upon Leavell's entry into the group, Oakley {{went out of his way}} to make the new member comfortable. On November 11, 1972, overjoyed at the prospect of leading a jam session later that night, Oakley crashed his motorcycle into the side of a bus, just three blocks from where Duane had been killed in a bike accident. He declined hospital treatment and went home, but gradually grew delirious. He was taken to the hospital shortly thereafter and died of cerebral swelling caused by a fractured skull. Oakley was buried directly beside Duane at Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia.|$|E

60|$|Then it was I felt {{how much}} more insupportable is the anguish of remorse than every other mental pang. Oh! <b>could</b> <b>I</b> but <b>have</b> cast off this crime that festered in my heart; <b>could</b> <b>I</b> but <b>have</b> regained the innocence that reigned in my breast as I entered the garden at Sestri; <b>could</b> <b>I</b> but <b>have</b> {{restored}} my victim to life, I felt as if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> look on with transport even though Bianca were in his arms.|$|R

500|$|Against all expectations, the war {{continued}} for five years. During this period, PedroII's {{time and energy}} were devoted to the war effort. He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy. The rape of women, widespread violence against civilians, ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay's invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him. He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that [...] "the war should be concluded as honor demands, cost what it cost." [...] "Difficulties, setbacks, and war-weariness {{had no effect on}} his quiet resolve", said Barman. Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil's righteous cause, and he stood prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome. Writing in his journal a few years previously PedroII remarked: [...] "What sort of fear <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have?</b> That they take the government from me? Many better kings than I have lost it, and to me it is no more than the weight of a cross which it is my duty to carry." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his initial}} success, Duncan {{was unable to}} retain control {{in the face of}} a more {{widespread}} revolt on 15 May among the ships based at the Nore, which became known as the Nore Mutiny. Led by a sailor named Richard Parker, the Nore mutineers quickly organised and became a significant threat to water traffic in the Thames Estuary. Duncan was informed that his fleet at Yarmouth might be ordered to attack the mutineers and, although reluctant, responded, [...] "I do not shrink from the business if it cannot otherwise be got the better of". When rumours of the plan reached the fleet at Yarmouth, the crew of Venerable also expressed their distaste with the plan, but reaffirmed their promise of loyalty to their admiral whatever the circumstances. News then arrived that the Dutch fleet under De Winter was preparing to sail, and Duncan's fleet was ordered by Lord Spencer to blockade the Dutch coast. Duncan issued orders for the fleet to weigh anchor, but the men disobeyed and ship after ship overthrew their officers and joined the mutineers at the Nore. Eventually Duncan was left with only his own Venerable and Hotham's Adamant to contain the entire Dutch fleet. Duncan later wrote that, [...] "To be deserted by my own fleet in the face of the enemy is a disgrace which I believe never before happened to a British admiral, nor <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> supposed it possible." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E

500|$|... "Sweet Sacrifice", {{the first}} song of the album, {{contains}} [...] "rumbling guitars" [...] and a string section according to IGNs Ed Thompson. The main theme of the song is recovery from an abusive relationship, which also inspired all of the songs on Fallen. Jordan Reimer of The Daily Princetonian and Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said the song was written for Evanescence's former guitarist Ben Moody. [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] is a rock song that starts as a piano ballad before quickly becoming an alternative metal song that uses elements of nu metal, symphonic rock and pop music. Lee said she wrote the song for her ex-boyfriend Shaun Morgan of South African alternative metal band Seether. Described as a [...] "chick anthem", the song's protagonist explains the reasons {{the relationship between the}} pair will not work through the lyrics [...] "Don't cry to me…If you loved me, you would be here with me /...How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> burned paradise? How could I…you were never mine". [...] "Weight of the World" [...] is a mixture of pop and metal, according to Stornoway Gazette. Inspired by the pressures of fame, it contains [...] "Eastern motifs" [...] and [...] "distorted vocals" [...] in the opening lines [...] "Feels like {{the weight of the world}} / Like God in heaven gave me a turn / Don't cling to me, I swear I can't fix you" [...] and in the chorus, [...] "If you love me, then let go of me / I won't be held down by who I used to be".|$|E
2500|$|Tebaldi never married. In a 1995 {{interview}} with The Times, {{she said she}} had no regrets about her single life. [...] "I was in love many times," [...] she said. [...] "This is very good for a woman." [...] But she added, [...] "How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been a wife, a mother and a singer? Who takes care of the piccolini when you go around the world? Your children would not call you Mama, but Renata." [...] She had a short relationship with Nicola Rossi-Lemeni and a longer one with Arturo Basile.|$|E
2500|$|Monica's career {{came to a}} {{slow down}} in 1999 due to {{relationship}} problems with her ex-boyfriend Jarvis Weems. In July 2000, the couple were together at the gravesite of Weems's brother, {{who had died in}} an automobile accident at age 25 in 1998, when Weems, without warning, put a gun to his head and committed suicide. [...] "Afterward, I felt, 'What else <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done?' You replay that situation over and over and you switch it around: Maybe if I had said this, or if I would have done that,'" [...] {{she said in an interview}} with The Cincinnati Enquirer the following year. [...] "It's just something that it's never possible for me to go back and change." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Karandighi, anger lead to {{looting and}} later violence. [...] Shortly after 2pm IST on 15 April, a {{delivery}} of 500 tarpaulin sheets arrived. Villagers {{seeing that the}} supply {{would not be enough}} for everyone in need decided to take matters into their own hands. Some protesters jumped a wall, broke into the godown, and looted the tarpaulins. Police were called in, but were blocked from entering the facility by protesters. One looter remarked [...] "What else <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done? The government is not helping us so we have to help ourselves." [...] Just after noon on 16 April, an angry mob attacked Panchayat Pradhan Badal Singh and began to beat him. One of the perpetrators said he couldn't control his anger when he saw that Singh [...] "was distributing the [...] sheets only to his party supporters." [...] Throughout the North Dinajpur district, panchayat leaders have fled their homes after being attacked by angry villagers.|$|E
2500|$|In Russia, Savchenko {{is portrayed}} {{extremely}} negatively in the media; according to BBC News [...] "Crude, {{and at times}} sexist, innuendo is used to demonise Ms Savchenko". The Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said that Savchenko {{is known as a}} [...] "killing machine in a skirt", and Tvoy Den called her [...] "Satan's daughter". Russian social media, however, tends to be more nuanced towards her with several anti-Kremlin users mocking perceived oddities in the Russian authorities' version of events, in particular their claim that she entered the country as a refugee. In March 2016, Russian composer Vladimir Nazarov wrote in an open letter to Putin saying that [...] "not even in my worst nightmare <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> imagined that I would have to ask you not to kill a woman." [...] In March 2016, Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny stated about Savchenko's trial, [...] "However you look at it, this doesn't benefit Russia". Navalny said that whoever planned to make Savchenko [...] "a trophy prisoner" [...] had miscalculated. He described the trial as such an [...] "obvious stitch-up" [...] you could [...] "see the threads".|$|E
2500|$|Having {{spent his}} early years {{in front of the}} cameras on Leave it to Beaver as [...] "Gilbert Bates" [...] (56 episodes), Talbot {{abandoned}} acting for a career as a journalist. In an article in Salon.com he looked back with a sense of humor about his past role. [...] "In the interests of historical accuracy I should say that, yes, Gilbert was a troublemaker and an occasional liar, but my character was certainly no Eddie Haskell – that leering teenage hypocrite who spoke unctuously to parents ('Well, hello Mrs. Cleaver, and how is young Theodore today?') and venomously to the Beav ('Hey, squirt, take a powder before I squash you like a bug')."! [...] "I have spent my adult life trying to conceal my Leave it to Beaver past or correcting the historical record. Either way the series has become inescapable. When I was a kid, I loved acting; in fact, I badgered my father and mother until they allowed me to work. But how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known as an innocent 9-year-old that I was taking part in a television program that would live on for 40 years as an icon for baby boomers? In the early '80s, I turned down an offer to revive my role as Gilbert in a dreadful Beaver reunion series. [...] "I'm trying to establish myself as a documentary filmmaker and an investigative reporter," [...] I explained to the producers. [...] "I can't go back to being Gilbert!" ...|$|E
