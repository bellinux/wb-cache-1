25|$|ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis).

25|$|The {{decision}} to treat is usually made after {{a combination of}} physical exam and laboratory diagnosis, with additional testing including audiometry, tympanogram, temporal bone CT and MRI. Decongestants, glucocorticoids, and topical antibiotics are generally not effective as treatment for non-infectious, or serous, causes of mastoid effusion. In less severe cases or those without significant hearing impairment, the effusion <b>can</b> <b>resolve</b> spontaneously or with more conservative measures such as autoinflation. In more severe cases, tympanostomy tubes can be inserted, possibly with adjuvant adenoidectomy.|$|E
25|$|If a {{being is}} accidentally omnipotent, it <b>can</b> <b>resolve</b> the paradox by {{creating}} a stone it cannot lift, thereby becoming non-omnipotent. Unlike essentially omnipotent entities, {{it is possible for}} an accidentally omnipotent being to be non-omnipotent. This raises the question, however, {{of whether or not the}} being was ever truly omnipotent, or just capable of great power. On the other hand, the ability to voluntarily give up great power is often thought of as central to the notion of the Christian Incarnation.|$|E

25|$|Algebraic {{number theory}} is {{a branch of}} number theory that uses the {{techniques}} of abstract algebra to study the integers, rational numbers, and their generalizations. Number-theoretic questions are {{expressed in terms of}} properties of algebraic objects such as algebraic number fields and their rings of integers, finite fields, and function fields. These properties, such as whether a ring admits unique factorization, the behavior of ideals, and the Galois groups of fields, <b>can</b> <b>resolve</b> questions of primary importance in number theory, like the existence of solutions to Diophantine equations.|$|E
25|$|Birds <b>can</b> <b>resolve</b> rapid {{movements}} {{better than}} humans, for whom flickering {{at a rate}} greater than 50 light pulse cycles per second appears as continuous movement.

A Cooper's hawk can pursue agile prey through woodland and avoid branches and other objects at high speed; to humans such a chase would appear as a blur.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{religion of}} the island is ancestor worship. In one oral tradition, the earliest residents knew {{the name of the}} creator, but thought his name was so holy that {{they did not want to}} tell their children. Instead, they instructed their children to address their requests to their ancestors, who would be their mediators. In some parts of Malaita the high god responsible for creation, who has now retired from active work, is known as Agalimae ("the god of the universe"). Congregations of local descent groups propitiate their ancestors at shrines, led by ritual officiants (fataabu in northern Malaita). On Malaita, many shrines have been preserved, not only for their sanctity but also because they serve as territorial markers that <b>can</b> <b>resolve</b> land disputes.|$|E

25|$|Until the age {{of space}} travel, objects in the {{asteroid}} belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery. The best modern ground-based telescopes and the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope <b>can</b> <b>resolve</b> {{a small amount of}} detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids, but even these mostly remain little more than fuzzy blobs. Limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their light curves (their variation in brightness as they rotate) and their spectral properties, and asteroid sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occulations (when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star). Radar imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters, especially for near-Earth asteroids. In terms of delta-v and propellant requirements, NEOs are more easily accessible than the Moon.|$|E
25|$|HLA {{types are}} inherited, {{and some of}} them are {{connected}} with autoimmune disorders and other diseases. People with certain HLA antigens are more likely to develop certain autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis, celiac disease, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), myasthenia gravis, inclusion body myositis, Sjögren syndrome, and narcolepsy. HLA typing has led to some improvement and acceleration in the diagnosis of celiac disease and type 1 diabetes; however, for DQ2 typing to be useful, it requires either high-resolution B1*typing (resolving *02:01 from *02:02), DQA1*typing, or DR serotyping. Current serotyping <b>can</b> <b>resolve,</b> in one step, DQ8. HLA typing in autoimmunity is being increasingly used as a tool in diagnosis. In celiac disease, it is the only effective means of discriminating between first-degree relatives that are at risk from those that are not at risk, prior to the appearance of sometimes-irreversible symptoms such as allergies and secondary autoimmune disease.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} the loose seal is that the pipette that is used can be repeatedly removed from the membrane after recording, and the membrane will remain intact. This allows repeated measurements {{in a variety of}} locations on the same cell without destroying the integrity of the membrane. This flexibility has been especially useful to researchers for studying muscle cells as they contract under real physiological conditions, obtaining recordings quickly, and doing so without resorting to drastic measures to stop the muscle fibers from contracting. A major disadvantage is that the resistance between the pipette and the membrane is greatly reduced, allowing current to leak through the seal, and significantly reducing the resolution of small currents. This leakage can be partially corrected for, however, which offers the opportunity to compare and contrast recordings made from different areas on the cell of interest. Given this, {{it has been estimated that}} the loose patch technique <b>can</b> <b>resolve</b> currents smaller than 1 mA/cm2.|$|E

25|$|By tradition, the Orthodox Church, {{when faced}} with issues that are larger than a single bishop <b>can</b> <b>resolve,</b> holds a local council. The bishops and such others as may attend convene (as St. Paul called the Corinthians to do) to seek {{the mind of the}} church. A council's {{declarations}} or edicts then reflect its consensus (if one can be found). An ecumencial council is only called for issues of such import or difficulty or pervasiveness that smaller councils are insufficient to address them. Ecumenical councils' declarations and canons carry binding weight by virtue of their representation across the whole church, by which the mind of the church can be readily seen. However, not all issues are so difficult as to require an ecumenical council to resolve. Some doctrines or decisions, not defined in a formal statement or proclaimed officially, nevertheless are held by the Church unshakably and unanimously without internal disturbance, and these, also reflecting the mind of the church, are just as firmly irrevocable as a formal declaration of an ecumenical council. Lack of formality does not imply lack of authority within Holy Tradition. An example of such unanimity {{can be found in the}} acceptance in the 5th century of the lists of books that comprise Holy Scripture, a true canon without official stamp.|$|E
