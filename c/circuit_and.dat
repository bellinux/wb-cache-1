40|$|Extract] This hook is an {{introduction}} to advanced electrical <b>circuits</b> <b>and</b> modern electronics. The main reason for writing this book is to assist students in learning the basic concepts of advanced electrical <b>circuits</b> <b>and</b> modern electronics {{and to do it}} in such a way that students can continue to learn additional electrical <b>circuits</b> <b>and</b> electronics on their own. Although the field of electrical <b>circuits</b> <b>and</b> electronics is changing, the fundamental laws describing the operation of electrical <b>circuits</b> <b>and</b> electronic devices and the methods of analysis used to understand electrical <b>and</b> electronic <b>circuits,</b> change slowly, if at all. The purpose of this book is to prepare students to be able to read the current literature in the field of electrical <b>circuits</b> <b>and</b> electronics and to be able to learn more electrical <b>circuits</b> <b>and</b> electronics on their own. The goal of teaching students how to learn on their own is. after all, what higher education is all about...|$|R

40|$|Abstract â Computing {{combined}} <b>circuits</b> <b>and</b> shortest cyclic paths {{between two}} given nodes in undirected graphs {{is a fundamental}} operation over graphs. While a number of techniques exist for answering computing <b>circuits</b> <b>and</b> approximating node distances efficiently in directed graphs, but the actual circuit calculations, their generations and shortest cyclic paths in undirected graphs are often neglected. However, it is often essential to find out all combined <b>circuits</b> <b>and</b> shortest cyclic paths between two given nodes in an undirected graphs. In this paper, we have addressed this problem and presented an optimistic algorithm that not only supports calculation of circuits but also generates combined <b>circuits</b> <b>and</b> computes corresponding shortest cyclic paths in undirected graphs. This algorithm is also applicable to directed graphs as well...|$|R
