5000|$|Some horse owners express two {{concerns}} about <b>feeding</b> <b>dry,</b> unsoaked beet pulp, one being {{that it is}} linked to choke.

[...] However, while horses have choked on beet pulp, university studies have not documented that beet pulp is a particular problem. [...] It is believed that choke related to beet pulp {{is linked to the}} particle size and the horse's aggressive feeding behaviour, rather than the actual feed itself. Nonetheless, the risk of choke associated with any <b>dry</b> <b>feed,</b> including beet pulp, can be reduced by soaking the ration prior to feeding.|$|R
