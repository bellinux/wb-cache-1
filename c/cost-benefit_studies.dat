5000|$|A {{report from}} Spain {{noted that the}} {{investigation}} and development of new techniques for instrumented surgery of the spine is not free from conflicts of interest. The influence of financial forces {{in the development of}} new technologies and its immediate application to spine surgery, shows the relationship between the published results and the industry support. Authors who have developed and defended fusion techniques have also published new articles praising new spinal technologies. The author calls spinal surgery the [...] "American Stock and Exchange" [...] and [...] "the bubble of spine surgery". The scientific literature doesn't show clear evidence in the <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>studies</b> of most instrumented surgical interventions of the spine compared with the conservative treatments. It has not been yet demonstrated that fusion surgery and disc replacement are better options than the conservative treatment. It's necessary to point out that at present [...] "there are relationships between the industry and back pain, and there is also an industry of the back pain". Nonetheless, the [...] "market of the spine surgery" [...] is growing because patients are demanding solutions for their back problems. The tide of scientific evidence seems to go against the spinal fusions in the degenerative disc disease, discogenic pain and in specific back pain. After decades of advances in this field, the results of spinal fusions are mediocre. New epidemiological studies show that [...] "spinal fusion must be accepted as a non proved or experimental method for the treatment of back pain". The surgical literature on spinal fusion published in the last 20 years establishes that instrumentation seems to slightly increase the fusion rate and that instrumentation doesn't improve the clinical results in general. We still are in need of randomized studies to compare the surgical results with the natural history of the disease, the placebo effect, or conservative treatment. The European Guidelines for lumbar chronic pain management show [...] "strong evidence" [...] indicating that complex and demanding spine surgery where different instrumentation is used, is not more effective than a simple, safer and cheaper posterolateral fusion without instrumentation. Recently, the literature published in this field is sending a message to use [...] "minimally invasive techniques"; - the abandonment of transpedicular fusions. Surgery in general, and usage of metal fixation should be discarded in most cases.|$|E

40|$|R&D {{spending}} in New Zealand {{is a mixture}} of private and public investment undertaken to improve productive activity and efficiency. Investment is split fairly equally between private business, government organisations and the universities. It is a long term investment with some uncertainty about outcomes being achieved. It is predominantly a public good investment as most government organisations and universities are providers of R&D but not users of it and hence there is a discontinuity in the connection between investment and results. Furthurmore, the supply of R&D has properties of a free good which lead to users looking for new applications on a wider and wider front (spillovers). For these reasons R&D is generally regarded as a `good thing’ rather than a solid investment vehicle. <b>Cost-benefit</b> <b>studies</b> have shown, both in New Zealand and overseas, some projects with rates of return well in excess of the opportunity cost of capital, yet at the aggregate level there is a paucity of <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>studies</b> confirming such rates of return on a broader industry basis.

40|$|The Swedish Road Administration (SRA) {{performs}} <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>studies</b> {{for road}} infrastructure projects utilizing a specialized computer program {{known by its}} Swedish acronym EVA. This report describes three possible approaches to accomplish sensitivity studies of the SRA's costbenefit studies. A simple example explains how these approaches are applied {{in the context of}} the SRA's <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>studies.</b> First, the popular one-factor-at-a-time method is described. The major drawback of this approach is that interaction of factors cannot be addressed. The method of Monte Carlo simulation allows for this possibility. This method uses brute force computational power to calculate a large number of outcomes based on randomly altered values for the included factors. However, Monte Carlo simulation necessitates the assessment of the multivariate stochastic distribution of considered factors. It is generally very difficult to assess multivariate distributions and it is consequently difficult to utilize the full potential of the Monte Carlo technique. We suggest therefore that the SRA's sensitivity studies are based on few simulation runs where the factors are altered simultaneously in each run. The number of runs is kept low by appropriate selection of factor combinations in each run, utilizing statistical design theory for experiments. The so obtained "observations" are used to estimate a response surface, which is essentially a simplified regression relationship between the factors that matter in the context and the resulting ratio between a project's net present value and its cost. This method handles possible interaction between factors, requires from the investigator merely the determination of reasonable upper and lower bounds for included factors, and does not require a large number of simulation runs...|$|E
