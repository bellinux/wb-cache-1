5000|$|Research {{conducted}} before 1950 on sharp-tailed grouse habitat {{assessment was}} done visually. Hamerstrom (1939) reported sparse vegetation was seldom selected for nesting {{due to lack}} of adequate cover. Habitat generalizations were formed {{based on the number of}} individuals found at a given local. These assumptions were if more birds were present at one location and less at another, then the first must be the better habitat. Hamerstrom (1963) observed 119 of 207 (57%) grouse broods frequenting savannah style habitat. He concluded that the savannah style habitat was the habitat needed for best management. As the research on habitat for grouse species matured, so did the techniques used for assessment. Cover boards and Robel poles were developed to measure visual obstruction (VO) and create habitat indices. Cover boards were developed as early as 1938 by Wight (1938) to study white-tailed deer habitat. Wight’s (1938) <b>cover</b> <b>board</b> was 6 feet in height, marked and numbered every foot. Visible marks were counted to measure obstruction by plants. Kobriger (1965) developed a 4×4-foot board marked at 3-inch intervals with alternating white and black squares. He placed a camera in the center of the breeding ground at a height of 3 feet. He then placed the <b>cover</b> <b>board</b> 30 feet away taking photographs of the <b>cover</b> <b>board.</b> After compiling all the photographs, they were analyzed with a hand lens to assess the number of squares visible. This number gave him a vegetation index of cover classes. This method has been modified by Limb et al. (2007). Instead of taking photographs 30 feet away like Kobriger (1965), Limb et al. (2007) took photographs of vegetation back-dropped by a 1×1-meter <b>cover</b> <b>board</b> at a height of 1 meter, 4 meters away. These digital photographs were uploaded to Adobe Acrobat and digitized to the 1×1-meter backdrop (Limb et al. 2007). Robel et al. (1970) developed a pole to determine height based on correlated vegetation weight. The pole was duly named the Robel pole. Robel et al. (1970) found that VO measurements taken at a height of 1 m and a distance of 4 m from the pole gave a reliable index of the amount of vegetation production at a location. Hamerstrom et al. (1957) were quoted as saying [...] "Height and density of grass were clearly more important to the prairie chickens than species composition" [...] as reported by Robel et al. (1970). This was also believed to be true for the sharp-tailed grouse. These key aspects can now be assessed using the Robel pole, Nudds <b>cover</b> <b>board,</b> and Limb et al. digital photography method effectively and efficiently.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to classifying sites by dominant canopy, we estimated canopy closure as percent view obstructed (viewed through a vertical 13 cm long PVC tube with 5 cm diameter) averaged across the 30 vegetation sampling points and at 6 m east and 6 m west of each sampling point. For understory habitat, we measured understory cover, sapling density, and {{an index of}} downed logs. We used a 0.532 m 2 <b>cover</b> <b>board,</b> vertically divided into four blocks, to measure understory cover. A person at the sampling point estimated percent view obstructed at 0.5 m increments above the ground (viewed at eye level for each height band), while the <b>cover</b> <b>board</b> was held at 6 m east and also at 6 m west of the sampling point. The three categories of understory cover above 0.5 m were highly correlated (r > 0.78), so we included only understory 0 m to 0.5 m and understory 0.5 m to 1.0 m in analyses. Sapling density was calculated {{as the number of}} live saplings with trunk centerline within a 2 m radius of the sampling point. Saplings were defined as trees with < 5 cm diameter at breast height. Results are presented as average number of saplings ha− 1. Our index of downed logs was the average number of downed logs > 5 cm diameter encountered per transect. Two 6 m transects were laid at each sampling point, one extending east and the other west from the central point.|$|E
40|$|Arboreal {{reptiles}} {{are often}} difficult to capture because of their cryptic nature and propensity to flee out of reach when approached. In addition, arboreal lizards often seek refuge under loose or peeling tree bark; therefore researchers often remove it to catch them, thereby potentially damaging habitat. Using arboreal cover boards, or "artificial bark," might reduce damage to natural shelter sites, allowing repeated surveys. We compared capture success and population structure of samples obtained by two capture methods-active searches (visual encounter surveys [VES]) and arboreal cover boards used as artificial bark-on two species of arboreal lizards, Inland Snake-eyed Skinks (Cryptoblepharus australis) and Dubious Dtellas (Gehyra dubia). Two types of arboreal cover boards (cardboard and closed-cell foam) were strapped around the main trunks of trees with elastic straps. Systematic VES during the day (for Cryptoblepharus) and at night (for Gehyra) were conducted in conjunction with monitoring of arboreal cover boards. Diurnal VES for Cryptoblepharus had low capture success (17. 1 % of observed animals) compared to arboreal cover boards (49. 6 %). Nocturnal spotlight surveys for Gehyra resulted in {{a high number of}} observations, but low capture success (44. 9 % of observed animals) compared to arboreal cover boards (83. 5 %). There was no difference in the capture success between <b>cover</b> <b>board</b> materials. Using arboreal cover boards as artificial bark increased hand captures of arboreal lizards, and preserved natural bark shelters that would have otherwise been destroyed by peeling bark during visual encounter surveys...|$|E
40|$|Roofing {{systems are}} an {{important}} component of the building envelope. Though the Adhesive Applied Roof Systems (AARS) are gaining popularity in North America, systematic review of the existing national and international standards revealed that there is no proper testing procedure established to quantify the peel resistance of AARS. The objective of the present study is to develop a peel testing procedure based on systematic laboratory investigations. Specimens (6 in. x 6 in. or 152 mm x 152 mm) composed of insulation and <b>cover</b> <b>board</b> were adhered together by applying cold adhesives. To represent the realistic conditions of the field construction, specimens were prepared using components from four industrial sources. Specimens were then subjected to a peeling force at two different locations with various peel angles ranging from 7. 5 ° to 45 ° to simulate the blister shape, that can occur on AARS under several wind action. Additional specimen sizes were also tested for selected combinations to evaluate the size effect. A total of 378 specimens with various physical parameters were constructed, cured for 28 days and tested using an Instron machine at a constant loading speed. For all cases, the failure load as well as the failure mode was recorded. Data analysis indicates that the failure load decreases as the peel angle increases, though it increases with the sample size. Generalized curves reflecting the peel resistance versus peel angle and the sample size are presented. Failure mode analysis identified the weakest link of the AARS samples under simulated wind induced peeling force. Based on the experimental investigation, a standard peel test method was drafted. This standard has an essential importance for the evaluation of AARS performance under wind-induced peel forces, which will be applicable to the new roofing assemblies as well as the existing roofing assembly to be replaced or recovered...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the potential of two amphibians species, Eastern Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus (Green)) and Eastern Red-spotted Newt (Notopthalmus viridescens viridescens Rafinesque), as indicator species of forest disturbances at Harvard Forest, located in Petersham, Massachusetts, United States. Specifically, I 1) assess the impacts of these focal species to decline of hemlock forests in Harvard Forest; 2) calibrate abundance indices of P. cinereus based on artificial and natural objects surveys with a population size estimator based on depletion sampling; and 3) assess the potential of these salamanders as indicator species by developing an objective and multimetric method. My results showed that decline of Eastern Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) forests due to invasive insects has increased the occupancy of P. cinereus but significantly reduced its estimated abundance and detection probability. Similarly, the estimated abundance of N. v. viridescens also declined dramatically after hemlock decline. The anticipated transition from forests dominated by T. canadensis to mixed-hardwood may alter the abundance and detection probability of both salamander species by up to 50 %. Abundance indices based on both <b>cover</b> <b>board</b> and natural object surveys were able to be calibrated using density estimates of P. cinereus derived from depletion (removal) surveys. The cover-board abundance index was eight times higher than the estimated density of P. cinereus, whereas the natural object survey was half the size of the density estimator. I introduced the Indicator Species Potential (ISP) index – a multi-metric method to quantify the efficacy of indicator species in classifying sites, monitoring ecological changes, and assessing desired management conditions. When applied to salamanders as potential indicators of changes in forests in Massachusetts, the ISP suggests that P. cinereus is a reasonable indicator for ecological change in hemlock stands whereas N. viridescens is a potential IS in mixed hardwoods. Overall, the ISP shows promise as a method for summarizing ecological and statistical information about potential IS in a single value...|$|E
