5|$|In 1942 Hicks {{took a job}} at the Western Electric Company, {{designing}} and testing quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators</b> in Kearny, New Jersey. She was the first woman to be employed by Western Electric as an engineer, and she spent three years working there. Upon the death of her father, she joined the Bloomfield, New Jersey based Newark Controls Company, a metalworking firm that her father had founded. Hicks served as chief engineer and then as {{vice president in charge of}} engineering, before purchasing control of the company from her uncle in 1955. Hicks designed and patented a gas density switch later used in the U.S. space program, including the moon landing, and was a pioneer in the field of sensors that detected when devices were reaching structural limits. Hicks authored several technical papers on the gas density switch. While at Newark Controls Hicks pursued a master's degree in physics, which she received in 1949 from the Stevens Institute.|$|E

25|$|Tuners {{are used}} by guitar {{technicians}} who are hired by rock and pop bands {{to ensure that all}} of the band's instruments are ready to play at all times. Guitar technicians (often called guitar techs) tune all of the instruments (electric guitars, electric basses, acoustic guitars, mandolins, etc.) before the show, after they are played, and before they are used onstage. Guitar techs also retune instruments throughout the show. Whereas amateur musicians typically use a relatively inexpensive quartz tuner, guitar technicians typically use expensive, high-end tuners such as strobe tuners. Most strobe tuners, counter-intuitively, also use quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators</b> as time references, although the responses are processed differently by the different units.|$|E
25|$|Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) {{oscillators}} are timing {{devices that}} generate highly stable reference frequencies, which can measure time. These reference frequencies {{may be used}} to sequence electronic systems, manage data transfer, define radio frequencies, and measure elapsed time. The core technologies used in MEMS oscillators have been in development since the mid-1960s, but have only been sufficiently advanced for commercial applications since 2006. MEMS oscillators incorporate MEMS resonators, which are microelectromechanical structures that define stable frequencies. MEMS clock generators are MEMS timing devices with multiple outputs for systems that need more than a single reference frequency. MEMS oscillators are a valid alternative to older, more established quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators,</b> offering better resilience against vibration and mechanical shock, and reliability with respect to temperature variation.|$|E

500|$|The Bliley Electric Company, a {{manufacturer}} of <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators</b> used in radio transmitters and receivers, moved from 8th and Peach Streets to space {{on the second floor}} of Union Station in 1933. Despite the possibility that soot and vibrations from passing locomotives could cause calibration problems for Bliley's quartz crystals, Union Station's proximity to the railroad provided [...] "efficient transfers of [...] heavy crystal stock from the train to the [...] slicing department." [...] Bliley Electric soon grew to occupy the entire second and third floors of the station. During World War II, the company operated 24hours a day and employed local women to grind and fashion the crystals; the crystals used in the operation were stockpiled in the rail yard, where it and the entire complex were guarded by soldiers with Great Danes. Bliley Electric eventually moved its entire operation to a larger, purpose-built facility in 1966.|$|E

2500|$|A {{frequency}} synthesizer is an electronic circuit that generates {{a range of}} frequencies from a single reference frequency. Frequency synthesizers are used in many modern devices such as radio receivers, televisions, mobile telephones, radiotelephones, walkie-talkies, CB radios, cable television converter boxes [...] satellite receivers, and GPS systems. A {{frequency synthesizer}} may use the techniques of frequency multiplication, frequency division, direct digital synthesis, frequency mixing, and phase-locked loops to generate its frequencies. The stability and accuracy of the frequency synthesizer's output {{are related to the}} stability and accuracy of its reference frequency input. Consequently, synthesizers use stable and accurate reference frequencies, such as those provided by <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators.</b>|$|E

50|$|A <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> is an {{electronic}} oscillator circuit {{that uses a}} piezoelectric resonator, a crystal, as its frequency-determining element. Crystal is the common term used in electronics for the frequency-determining component, a wafer of quartz crystal or ceramic with electrodes connected to it. A more accurate term for it is piezoelectric resonator. Crystals are also used in other types of electronic circuits, such as crystal filters. Piezoelectric resonators are sold as separate components for use in <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> circuits. An example {{is shown in the}} picture.
