50|$|Thomas Kemp of Baltimore {{designed}} Grecian {{with several}} innovations. She was pierced for 20 guns, though she never carried that many, and her gunports were unique, designed perhaps to save weight. She had a long, curving stem, and a shallow, less <b>convex</b> <b>bow.</b>|$|E
50|$|Extreme bow has {{an effect}} on the ease with which stick-work and hitting of the ball (so that it stays on the ground) may be carried out. There has always been some bow to a stick handle, 10-20 mm was common (right in diagram) because to have a stick that was {{straight}} would make 'gathering' the ball, by pulling it towards the body from the left, more difficult and a bow in the other direction (a <b>convex</b> <b>bow)</b> would cause 'dragging' in stick-work and make hitting the ball cleanly difficult in the other.|$|E
50|$|The Willing is 40 ft long, 14 ft {{wide and}} draws 3.08 ft. She has a {{traditional}} clipper bow-shaped cutwater in a sharp, but <b>convex</b> <b>bow,</b> and a square transom. She carries a pushblock for a pushboat {{to allow her}} to dredge in light airs. The kinbg plank runs from the bow past the mast, but stops short of the main hatch. Following a second, smaller hatch, a small doghouse is set on the deck to provide low headroom in what would otherwise be a very low cabin, 2.5 ft high. A box at the stern contains the hydraulic steering gear installed by Sweitzer to replace the original patent gear. Davits for the pushboat hang over the transom.|$|E
5000|$|One or two Plano-Convex (PC for short) lenses {{within the}} lens tube {{to create the}} lens train. The Plano-Convex lenses, named for having one flat side and one <b>convex</b> (<b>bowed</b> out) side, have their convex sides facing each other within the tube. The {{distance}} between these lenses and {{the distance between them}} and the reflector determines how wide the output beam of light is ...|$|R
40|$|Appendicular {{skeletons of}} isotemnid notoungulates are {{described}} from Cañadón Vaca (Vacan ‘‘subage’’, Casamayoran South American Land Mammal ‘‘Age’’,?middle to late Eocene). Simpson documented three of these, Thomashuxleya externa, Anisotemnus distentus, and Pleurostylodon similis, some 70 years ago, in fashioning a composite isotemnid skeleton, {{but he did}} not emphasize their differences from one another. We note variation, especially in the forelimb, that appears to be functionally significant as well as phylogenetically informative. For example, the downwardly curved olecranon, ventrally concave bowing of the ulnar shaft, and orthogonally directed articulation of the elbow joint suggest an erect forelimb stance in Thomashuxleya externa, whereas the forelimbs of Anisotemnus distentus and Pleurostylodon similis show indications of a crouching posture, including ventrally <b>convex</b> <b>bowing</b> of the ulnar shaft with a slight upward curvature of the olecranon, and an elbow joint in which the antebrachium rotated obliquely relative to the humerus. Articular facets on the proximal carpals suggest that the manus of Anisotemnus was habitually extended, indicating a plantigrade stance of the forelimb. Although none of these three taxa have associated hindfoot material, all known Vacan notoungulate astragali have shallow trochlea, well...|$|R
25|$|In 1989, the German cellist Michael Bach began {{developing}} a curved bow, encouraged by John Cage, Dieter Schnebel, Mstislav Rostropovich and Luigi Colani: {{and since then}} many pieces have been composed especially for it. This curved bow (BACH.Bow) is a <b>convex</b> curved <b>bow</b> which, unlike the ordinary bow, renders possible polyphonic playing on the various strings of the instrument. The solo repertoire for violin and cello by J. S. Bach the BACH.Bow is particularly suited to it: and it was developed with this in mind, polyphonic playing being required, as well as monophonic.|$|R
5000|$|The Kathryn is 50 ft long, 15.67 ft {{wide and}} draws 4.17 ft of water. She is {{somewhat}} unusual {{in having a}} [...] "soft" [...] chine rather than a [...] "hard", sharply angled chine. Kathryn otherwise follows the pattern of a Chesapeake Bay skipjack, with a clipper bow-style cutwater, a sharp <b>convex</b> <b>bow,</b> beamy middle, and a flat transom stern. Like all present-day skipjacks she has a stern-mounted push plate to allow operation with a pushboat. She is fore-and-aft-planked, unlike most skipjacks, which are cross-planked. Her flush deck follows the standard skipjack plan, with a main hatch abaft the mast, followed by dredging gear, a smaller hatch, a doghouse over a very low cabin, the steering gear {{and a set of}} davits for the pushboat. The cabin is finished with varnished tongue-and-groove paneling, and has a bunk on each side under the deck. Steering gear is hydraulic.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{continues}} and {{completes the}} publication of a series of towing tank tests initiated several years ago in the frame of an interuniversity project partially supported by the Ministry of Education, University and Research among the Universities of Genova, Napoli and Trieste. Two equivalent hull designs have been designed to be suitable for a fast passenger and ro-ro ferry of medium dimension (about 800 passengers, 250 cars) on short routes typical of the Mediterranean and Northern Seas, with a design speed of about 38 - 40 knots. Comparison of the main resistance of these two different trimaran hulls (having different hull shapes but equivalent in terms of total displacement, main geometric parameters and significant form coefficients), tested in model scale with different side hulls positions will be addressed in the paper and results of a systematic series of towing tank tests taken on different configurations are presented. The first trimaran features a main typical fast round bilge hull having V-type bow sections with low flair and stern U-type sections closed towards the transom in both vertical and transversal directions. Side hulls were designed with hard chines forms with simple slightly <b>convex</b> <b>bow</b> sections, high deadrise angle of the main section and slightly warped aft straight sections. The main hull of the second model was chosen of Deep-V type with simple transverse section made of straight line having high deadrise angle at the main section, same length and displacement of the previous hull as well as same CP and LCB for an unbiased comparison of the residual resistance of the two alternative main hulls. The side hulls of the second model were designed assuming simple symmetric U-type section with a small transom. The towing test matrix of each of the two solutions includes a total of 24 configurations obtained by three longitudinal and four transversal outrigger position and two displacements and is reported in the paper under graphical representation of the residuary resistance coefficient and in tables with numerical values of the total resistance coefficient measured during the towing tank tests...|$|E
40|$|Micromirror based spatial light {{modulators}} (SLMs) {{developed by}} the Fraunhofer Institute for Photonic Microsystems are well established in microlithography applications. Serving, e. g., as reflective, programmable photomasks in deep-UV mask writers, they enable highly flexible pattern generation. During operation, the micromirror bow significantly impacts contrast and the resolvable feature size of generated patterns. In some situations, MEMS micromirrors tend to change their bow during laser irradiation. A test regime including a characterization unit for the in situ analysis of MEMS micromirror topology has been developed to measure the bow change under various irradiation conditions. Experiments in which SLMs were irradiated by a 1 -kHz, 248 -nmpulse laser revealed that mirror bowing can occur in both directions (concave and <b>convex).</b> The <b>bowing</b> direction is dependent upon the applied irradiation parameters such as pulse-energy density, pulse number, and the deposited energy. Sustained irradiation at energy densities exceeding a certain limit can potentially become a limiting factor for the resolvable feature sizes of the patterns generated and, therefore, for the usable SLM lifespan...|$|R
50|$|The Rebecca T. Ruark is {{a typical}} sloop-rigged skipjack, built for the shallow draft, low {{freeboard}} and high stability needed to work the Chesapeake Bay oyster beds. She has a rounded chine with a sharp, <b>convex</b> clipper <b>bow</b> on a sloop hull. The Ruark is fore-and-aft planked. Her wood plug rudder is carried well forward beneath the transom, astern of the centerboard. As part of her 2000 U.S. Coast Guard certification to carry passengers for hire she received a watertight bulkhead ahead of the mast. An aluminum hatch provides access into the new space, which is used for sail and line storage. The deck is 2 in fir forward of the main hatch and pressure-treated pine aft. Deck beams are oak, with two 11.5 in king planks running from the bow to the main hatch. A central hatch measures 55 in long by 64.75 in wide. Behind the hatch is a small trunk cabin with a three-sided doghouse aft, with double doors leading from the doghouse to the hold. A fuel tank for the push boat is on the starboard side of the cabin. Pipe rails have been added for passenger carriage.|$|R
40|$|A thin, {{chemically}} inert 3 C-SiC layer between GaN and Si helps {{not only}} to avoid the “melt-back” effect, but also to inhibit the crack generation in the grown GaN layers. The quality of GaN layer is heavily dependent on the unique properties of the available 3 C-SiC/Si templates. In this paper, the parameters influencing the roughness, crystalline quality, and wafer bow are investigated and engineered to obtain high quality, low roughness 3 C-SiC/Si templates suitable for subsequent GaN growth and device processing. Kinetic surface roughening and SiC growth mechanisms, which depend on both deposition temperature and off-cut angle, are reported for heteroepitaxial growth of 3 C-SiC on Si substrates. The narrower terrace width on 4 ° off-axis Si enhances the step-flow growth at 1200 [*]°C, with the roughness of 3 C-SiC remaining constant with increasing thickness, corresponding to a scaling exponent of zero. Crack-free 3 C-SiC grown on 150 -mm Si substrate with a wafer bow of less than 20 [*]μm was achieved. Both concave and <b>convex</b> wafer <b>bow</b> {{can be obtained by}} in situ tuning of the deposited SiC layer thicknesses. The 3 C-SiC grown on off-axis Si, compared to that grown on on-axis Si, has lower surface roughness, better crystallinity, and smaller bow magnitude.

40|$|In this work, {{we report}} on the growth by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) of GaN layers on AlN/Si(111) {{templates}} with step-graded AlGaN intermediate layers. First, we will discuss the optimization of the AlN/Si(111) templates and then we will discuss the incorporation of step-graded AlGaN intermediate layers. It is found that the growth stress in GaN on high-temperature (HT) AlN/Si(111) templates is compressive, although, due to relaxation, the stress we have measured is much lower than the theoretical value. In order to prevent the stress relaxation, step-graded AlGaN layers are introduced and a crack-free GaN epitaxial layer of thickness > 1 mu m is demonstrated. Under optimized growth conditions, the total layer stack, exceeding 2 mu m in total, is kept under compressive stress, and the radius of the <b>convex</b> wafer <b>bowing</b> is as large as 119 m. The crystalline quality of the GaN layers is examined by high-resolution x-ray diffraction (HR-XRD), and the full-width-at-half maximums (FWHMs) of the x-ray rocking curve (0002) omega-scan and (- 1015) omega-scan are 790 arc sec and 730 arc sec, respectively. It is found by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that the step-graded AlGaN layers terminate or bend the dislocations at the interfaces. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Wafers warp. It is {{important}} to minimize warpage {{in order to achieve}} optimal die yield and potentially prevent future device failure. Although the word warpage is widely used in the literature to represent wafer <b>bow</b> (<b>convex</b> or concave shape), in the real world wafers are often seen into warp into saddle shapes. This complicates the characterization of both the sources of and solutions to warpage, because (as will be discussed) Stoney’s formula (relating intrinsic stress and curvature) does not apply for structures warped with compound curvature, and standard wafer warpage measurements are not designed to measure compound curvature. During thin film deposition, wafer warpage occurs due to the intrinsic stresses and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch of the different thin films and the substrate. Unfortunately, whereas the introduction of the thermal stresses due to CTE mismatch into a finite element model is easily understood, the introduction of intrinsic stress is not. Further, although a saddle shape is clearly a physically realizable (indeed, often preferred) equilibrium configuration for a circular disk (consistent with an appropriate state of stress), obtaining a saddle shape in a finite element solution turns out to be extremely difficult, as convex or concave shapes may also be stable and numerically preferred. In this paper, a finite element technique (using ANSYS software) to model wafer warpage is presented. Simulations have been done for silicon wafers with aluminum or standard UBM films on top. Saddle-shaped warpage has been successfully modeled, and the aggravating effects of thinning (back side grinding) have been reproduced.
