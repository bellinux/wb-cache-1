5|$|Feynman was a keen popularizer {{of physics}} through both books and lectures, {{including}} a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume {{publication of his}} undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You <b>Care</b> <b>What</b> Other People Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.|$|E
5|$|While {{trying on}} her bridesmaid's dress in the TGS fitting room, Colleen, Sylvia Rossitano (Patti LuPone), and Verna Maroney (Jan Hooks) criticize Liz {{for not being}} married by now as she is in her late thirties, but Liz does not <b>care</b> <b>what</b> they think. Later, Liz has a {{conversation}} with her mother Margaret Lemon (Anita Gillette) regarding Liz being single. During their conversation, Margaret reveals that her true love was Buzz Aldrin and not Liz's father Dick Lemon (Buck Henry), which shocks Liz. She tells Jack about what her mother has revealed to her and ponders why her mother did not choose to be with Buzz. Jack offers to introduce her to Buzz with Liz accepting, and wanting {{to find out what}} her mother missed out on. During their meet, Buzz confesses {{that it was a good}} decision that Margaret did not stay with him as he spent many of his years as an alcoholic. After her encounter with Buzz, Liz tells her mother that she respects the decision she made by not ending up with Buzz.|$|E

25|$|After {{reviewing}} the secret footage, the nominee {{was brought to}} New York City for a week of evaluation, shopping, and hair and make-up styling. Throughout the week, the nominee frequently declared {{she was unable to}} find properly fitting clothes, she disliked her body, or she didn't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> other people thought.|$|E
25|$|Polly's bubble in Paris burst {{when she}} learned shortly after their arrival that Harry had been flirting with a girl from Boston. It {{was the first of}} many flirtations and affairs that Polly would learn to live with. In early 1923, Polly {{introduced}} Harry to her friend Constance Coolidge. She was the niece of Frank Crowninshield, editor of Vanity Fair, and had been married to American diplomat Ray Atherton. Constance didn't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> others thought about her. She loved anything risky and was addicted to gambling. She and Harry soon began a sexual relationship.|$|E
25|$|The series also sidesteps {{issues of}} {{stereotyping}} by having characters {{in both the}} Muslim and non-Muslim communities who cross the entire spectrum of political opinion. Baber and Fatima, who represent conservative views within Islam, are balanced by conservative radio host Fred Tupper among the non-Muslims, while Amaar and Rayyan, who represent Islamic liberalism, are balanced by the liberal Anglican Rev. Magee. The more moderate Yasir and Sarah, who try to be good Muslims but aren't particularly strongly defined by their faith, are balanced among the non-Muslims by Mayor Popowicz, who doesn't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> anybody's religious beliefs are {{as long as they}} vote for her on election day.|$|E

25|$|In {{its present}} configuration, the Wanamaker Organ has 28,750 pipes in 464 ranks. The organ console {{consists}} of six manuals {{with an array}} of stops and controls that command the organ. The organ's String Division forms the largest single organ chamber in the world. The instrument features eighty-eight ranks of string pipes built by the W. W. Kimball Company of Chicago. The organ is famed for its orchestra-like sound, coming from pipes that are voiced softer than usual, allowing an unusually rich build-up because of the massing of pipe-tone families. The artistic obligation entailed by the creation of this instrument has always been honored, with two curators employed in its constant and scrupulous <b>care</b> (<b>what</b> leads to the state of one of the best maintained organ in the world). The organ, with its regular program of concerts and recitals, was maintained by Wanamaker's throughout the chain's history, even as the company's financial fortunes waned. This level of dedication was maintained when corporate parentage shifted from the Wanamaker family to Carter Hawley Hale Stores followed by Woodward & Lothrop, Lord & Taylor, and finally to Macy's.|$|E
25|$|Bill Oberst, {{the actor}} playing Sherman, {{states in a}} behind-the-scenes {{featurette}} that while the general {{will always be a}} controversial figure, he hopes that the documentary will shed light on why the man did what he did. It emphasizes that Sherman was loved by the enslaved blacks whom he freed and that while he did not see himself as fighting to destroy slavery, he nevertheless made a point of treating blacks whom he met with courtesy and respect. (The documentary also shows the reactions of his soldiers as they met blacks along the March. Many had never seen a black person and were surprised to learn that blacks were ordinary people.) The documentary also mentions that Sherman killed far fewer Confederate soldiers and civilians than did Ulysses S. Grant, his friend and fellow general, yet Sherman was the one vilified. The scholars interviewed postulate that the South had need for a scapegoat {{in the wake of the}} Civil War and that Sherman was the easiest target. For his part, Sherman is stated to have seen himself as only doing his duty and that he did not <b>care</b> <b>what</b> people said about him one way or the other.|$|E
500|$|Nothing {{would have}} {{happened}} without the Pistols. It was like, [...] "Wow, I believe in this." [...] What they were saying was: [...] "It's a load of shite. I'm {{going to do what}} I do and I don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> people think." [...] That was the key to it. People forget that, but it was the main ideology for me: we don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> you think—you're shit anyway. It was the attitude that got people moving, as well as the music.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{describes}} {{a person who}} is criticized for being different. The question and title lyric [...] "Who cares?" [...] is repeated throughout the song indicating that criticism does not affect her and she will stay the way she is. The chorus of the song asks (translated from the Spanish): [...] "Who <b>cares</b> <b>what</b> I do? / Who <b>cares</b> <b>what</b> I say? / I am the way I am. I'll keep on being that. / I will never change." ...|$|R

500|$|During {{the middle}} eight, Harrison {{refers to the}} privileged pigs in their sties who [...] "don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> goes on around"; they appear devoid of empathy, and {{therefore}} deserve [...] "a damn good whacking". In the third verse, Harrison declares that piggies are [...] "everywhere", leading [...] "piggy lives". He presents a final image of couples dining, holding their cutlery before devouring bacon.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} with {{the transmission of}} Quatermass II {{in the autumn of}} 1955, Hammer Film Productions released The Quatermass Xperiment, their film adaptation of the first serial. Kneale was not pleased with the film, and particularly disliked the casting of Brian Donlevy as Quatermass, as he explained in a 1986 interview. [...] " [...] was then really on the skids and didn't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> he was doing. He took very little interest in the making of the films or in playing the part. It was a case of take the money and run. Or in the case of Mr Donlevy, waddle." ...|$|E

500|$|Villarreal {{was chosen}} by scouts at the Sheraton Hotel in south McAllen {{to go to the}} next phase in Dallas. After doing well in Dallas, he was sent to auditions in California and finally got the part. He commented that [...] "Javier is a very good friend to Akeelah ... And also like his charisma, his character, he can always put a smile on your face. He really doesn't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> people think of him that much and he helps Akeelah out with that little matter because she cares very much of what people think about her." ...|$|E
500|$|Spence D. from IGN Music {{commented that}} the song is the coolest song on the album up to this point. Paul Rees from Q {{magazine}} complemented the track as a [...] "conventional rock song, filled with drama, darkness and surprises". USA Todays Edna Gunderson said that the [...] "funkified" [...] synth-pop of [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] attests to Madonna's [...] "undiminished" [...] skills as a shrewd pop composer. Yahoo! Music's Dan Genoe commented that Madonna has a personality crisis in the song. Jessica Winter from The Village Voice gave the song a mixed review, writing: [...] "It mutes slightly the slaphappy beats of Mirwais's own club hit [...] "Disco Science" [...] to make vague digs at the press and defensively vow self-improvement. Madonna's voice is mixed and diced into baby gurgles, {{which might have been}} cute if it weren't so redundant." [...] John Payne from LA Weekly deduced that even within the synth sounds of the song, he could see [...] "real feeling deeply ingrained in this particular icon. 'Why should I <b>care</b> <b>what</b> the world thinks of me?' That is, yes, she does <b>care</b> <b>what</b> the world thinks of her. She says she’ll just withdraw from the public eye, ’cause who needs this, huh?" [...] Conversely, Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, gave a negative review saying that [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] might be the silliest track that Madonna had ever recorded.|$|E
500|$|The serial's {{official}} website describes Ruby as being carefree, though {{she puts on}} a front to hide her emotions. Ruby arrives grieving {{for the loss of}} her mother; unlike her sister, Ruby takes an [...] "internal approach and bottled it up inside", creating a facade and appearing to be strong. They also brand her as independent and she does not <b>care</b> <b>what</b> others think about her and is inclined to keep to herself. Speaking of her aspirations in life, they add: [...] "Her goal in life is simply to be happy and to be content in enjoying life’s simpler things and the people in it." ...|$|E

500|$|Having been {{temporarily}} {{unable to}} begin production {{on the film}} for some time, due to De Laurentiis owning the rights, Lynch stopped actively pursuing Ronnie Rocket as a viability in the early 1990s. However, he has never officially abandoned the project; frequently referring to it in interviews as [...] "hibernating". The director has expressed interest in filming the project {{in the same manner}} as Eraserhead, using a small crew, building the sets himself and living on them during the length of the production. He has also claimed that he will revisit the film when he is at the stage in his career [...] "when I don't really <b>care</b> <b>what</b> happens, except that the film is finished".|$|E
500|$|Although labor strife was muted {{after the}} {{settlement}} of the railway strike, it continued through Truman's presidency. The President's approval rating dropped from 82% in the polls in January 1946 to 52% by June. This dissatisfaction with the Truman administration's policies led to large Democratic losses in the 1946 midterm elections, when Republicans took control of Congress {{for the first time}} since 1930. The 80th Congress included Republican freshmen who would become prominent in the years to come, including Wisconsin Senator Joe McCarthy and California Congressman Richard Nixon. When Truman dropped to 32% in the polls, Democratic Arkansas Senator William Fulbright suggested that Truman resign; the President said he did not <b>care</b> <b>what</b> Senator [...] "Halfbright" [...] said.|$|E
500|$|Author Patrick Croskery {{described}} Animals as {{a unique}} blend of the [...] "powerful sounds and suggestive themes" [...] of Dark Side with The Wall portrayal of artistic alienation. He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm. Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: [...] "If you didn't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> happened to me. And I didn't care for you", then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each. The lyrics ultimately {{paint a picture of}} dystopia, the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines.|$|E
