The games feature songs sung by Martin during the bonus feature and the <b>count-up</b> of a player's winnings. A compilation album called Amore! debuted at Number One on Billboard magazine's Top Pop Catalog Albums chart in its February 21, 2009, issue.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the game}} rule changes include a <b>count-up</b> system, {{as opposed to a}} [...] "combat round" [...] type of in-game {{time-keeping}} method. Players plan their actions second-by-second, with little or no down time between actions. Player characters in combat actively defend as well as attack and various combat maneuvers are offered to create a more realistic feel to the hostile encounter.The magic system has been overhauled to use spell points rather than a fixed number of spells. Clerics are no longer a single class, but are specific to the various deities within the pantheon.|$|E
50|$|The timekeeper's twenty-minute count-down {{clock is}} not {{displayed}} at a football game. Rather, a <b>count-up</b> clock is displayed, {{which is not}} stopped when the umpire blows time off. As such, patrons and players at a football game never know exactly when the siren is going to sound, which makes close games particularly tense. Typically, a twenty-minute quarter will last between 27 and 33 minutes; the time period between the 20 minute mark and the siren {{is referred to as}} time on. The coaches' boxes and television networks are provided with a feed to the timekeeper's count-down clock in professional games.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Count-Up</b> - This final {{segment of}} each episode shows 5 sub-segments that count upwards instead of {{counting}} down. First, 1 {{thing you have}} to hear features a random statement heard on the news or sports program that's found to be funny. 2 Things You Have to See showcases two clips of amazing sports moments. This segment is now renamed 4 things you have to see and replaced with random 2... segments. In 3 Great Collisions, three clips are shown, each with a crash, or a hard punch. This segment was replaced with random 3... segments. In 4 things to look out for, Matt Iseman tells four actual news stories about the teams and their coaches, however when getting to [...] "look out for", the pictures are often doctored. This segment has since then been replaced by 4 things you have to see. And finally, the clip considered to be the best of the week is the 5-Star Clip. One example is from a South African soccer league in which a player's shin was inverted due to an opposing player sliding to get the ball.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first game}} {{features}} a timer that starts {{a number of}} minutes {{at the beginning of}} each level (9 minutes 59 seconds on Easy mode, 8 minutes on Medium, 6 minutes on Hard, and 4 minutes on Turbo) and counts down to zero; on Hard and Turbo, another countdown appears at the top of the screen when there is less than a minute left, and if time expires, Jazz loses a life. If Jazz reaches and shoots the finish sign before time runs out, the player is then provided with additional score points awarded for the remaining time and a perfect score if he picks up all items and/or deals with all enemies. If Jazz finishes the area with a big red diamond, he gets to enter the bonus stage. In theses stages, animation switches to a pseudo-3D (third-person shooter) of Jazz as he runs on a speedway with the purpose of gathering as many blue diamonds as requested before time runs out, while obstacles try to stop him or slow him down. If the task is accomplished successfully, the player is provided with an extra life.Aside from bonuses, Jazz also features secret levels that can be accessed in specific areas of other levels once in every episode. Secret level signs feature the question mark instead of Devans head portrait that must be shot. The current level is then considered completed and the secret level embarks. Levels themselves consist of an enormous [...] "grant" [...] area with numerous weapons and items to pick up. One level, however, features a mini-boss, while the player assumes control of Jazz in his sidekick bird form. Secret levels also feature a <b>count-up</b> upon completion that provides the player with extra score points.|$|E
40|$|Throughout development, cells {{coordinate}} {{increases in}} cell number with {{the acquisition of}} specific cellular functions through differentiation. These processes often must be ordered sequentially such that one process completes before the next is initiated. In other situations, the two events occur simultaneously but must be precisely orchestrated to prevent interference of one event with the other. In {{the context of the}} Drosophila testis, I have investigated the mechanisms with which sperm precursor cells, or spermatogonia, divide exactly four times and then transition to the next phase of their development as spermatocytes. The work on this counting and transition problem involved characterization of a mutant, <b>count-up,</b> which underwent exactly one extra division before executing an apparently normal transition. During the extended growth phase in G 2 of the ensuing meiotic cell cycle, cells lay the groundwork for both the meiotic divisions and the numerous differentiation events that will convert the spermatocytes into functional sperm. Characterization of the mutant, off-schedule, identified a link between translation initiation control and both cell cycle progression and the onset of differentiation. I speculate that a checkpoint mechanism is activated in off-schedule spermatocytes, halting both coordinated processes in response to insufficient accumulation of mass. I then make the case that <b>count-up</b> and off-schedule are mutations in the same gene, and develop a model for counting and transition in the testis utilizing the knowledge I gained from off-schedule 2 ̆ 7 s role in meiosis and differentiation. ...|$|E
40|$|Received; revised; {{accepted}} Application {{of solar}} energy for wastewater treatment has {{shown to have}} the least negative effects and costs. This experimental research {{was carried out in}} pilot-scale on the effluent of the extended aeration activated sludge wastewater treatment system in Kashan. The plant is located at the Kashan University of Medical Sciences campus and receives about 100 m 3 /d sewage from official and residential building blocks. In this study thermal disinfection of the effluent in 55 ºC for 2 hours using flat plat solar collector (FPSC) was investigated. During the study in the beginning of every week, one day was selected randomly and the pilot was run. The pilot influent temperature was the same as ambient air throughout the day. If the liquid temperature within the pilot increased above 55 ºC, a thermostatic valve opened. Passed liquid was maintained for 2 hours in this temperature. Whenever the volume of disinfected effluent was measurable fecal MPN test and Nemathoda eggs <b>count-up</b> were done according to the Standard Methods and Leeds-II directions, respectively. In 200 days from April to November the geometric mean of fecal coliform never exceeded the WHO guideline (1000 MPN/ 100 mL), but in 5 days (21 %) it exceeded the Iranian standard (400 / 100 mL). Mathematical mean of Nemathoda eggs was less than 1 per liter (Engelberg Index) persistently. The mean of hydraulic loading rates was calculated 83. 25 L/d m 2 while it decreased to 41. 85 L/d. m 2 in the days without thermal reclamation...|$|E
40|$|Simple {{observation}} {{systems to}} record natural electromagnetic noises have been developed. AGC {{signals from the}} radio receiver are amplified and filtered by a low-pass circuit to record a longperiod variations of the noise level, and filtered with a high-pass circuit to <b>count-up</b> the number ofimpulsive noises. The specific frequency of 9. 5 kHz {{was used for the}} observation of VLF noises. For LF and HFcontinuous observations, 164 kHz and 20. 007 MHz were used, respectively. These frequencieshave been chosen {{based on the results of}} surveying the artificial signal distribution in the wide fre-quency range. The integrated signals of each frequency are recorded on the strip chart paper witha speed of 25 mm/h. The counted number of pulses are converted into the analogue voltage to berecorded on the same chart paper. VLF flash-type noises are clearly recorded by the latter method. Some examples of VLF imminent precursors have been obtained by these systems. They showthat the signal level increases gradually before the occurrence of earthquake, and neither co-seismicnor post-seismic signals are recorded. ELF natural noises have been continuously recorded by the pen recorder with a speed of 4 mm/sec. The sensor of this system is a ball antenna installed on the roof of the institute. The conti-nuous record have been obtained since the beginning of February, 1982. The Urakawa-oki earth-quake of M 7. 3 occurred in Hokkaido on March 21, 1982. The focal depth of the earthquake wasabout 30 km and a part of after-shock region was located in the land part of the coastal region. Anomalous ELF signals were clearly recorded before and after this main shock. The ELFsignals appeared about one day before the main shock. The signal intensity increased graduallyand then rapidly decreased until the occurrence of the first fore-shock. The similar ELF signalsappeared again after the occurrence of the main shock, and the maximum after-shock occurred atthe peak of this ELF radiation...|$|E
