Participants supported one of two competing cyclists involved in a race that was displayed on a screen in a lecture hall. The race scenario was manipulated so that the supported cyclist appeared to undergo either a positive or negative momentum sequence. In addition, participants were either exposed to a hot-wet environmental climate or to a <b>neutral</b> environmental <b>climate</b> while observing the race scenario. According to the results, reported levels of PM {{were higher in the}} positive momentum sequence condition than in the negative momentum sequence condition, consistent with the notion that supporters' PM is influenced by a positivity bias, and reported levels of PM were also found to be higher in the hot-wet climate condition than in the <b>neutral</b> <b>climate</b> condition, consistent with the notion that environmental climate is a contextual factor that influences PM through the operation of a causal augmenting mechanism...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{financial markets}} with agents exposed to external sources of risk caused for example by short term climate {{events such as}} the South Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies widely known under the name El Nino. Since such risks cannot be hedged through investments on the capital market alone, we face a typical example of an incomplete financial market. In order to make this risk tradable, we use a financial market model in which an additional insur-ance asset provides another possibility of investment besides the usual capital market. Given one of many possible market prices of risk each agent can maxi-mize his individual exponential utility from his income obtained from trading in the capital market, the additional security, and his risk exposure function. Under the equilibrium market clearing condition for the insurance security the market price of risk is uniquely determined by a backward stochastic differential equa-tion. We translate these stochastic equations via the Feynman-Kac formalism into semi-linear parabolic partial differential equations. Numerical schemes are available by which these semilinear pde can be simulated. We choose two simple qualitatively interesting models to describe sea surface temperature, and with an ENSO risk exposed fisher and farmer and a <b>climate</b> risk <b>neutral</b> bank three model agents with simple risk exposure functions. By simulating the expected appreciation price of risk trading, the optimal utility of the agents as a function of temperature, and their optimal investment into the risk trading security we obtain first insight into the dynamics of such a market in simple situations...|$|R

40|$|The shrimp fishery off the Mexican Pacific {{coast is}} the country's most {{important}} fishery {{from the economic}} standpoint. However, it faces serious problems, including the fleet's overcapitalization and age, {{in addition to the}} environmental variability that affects the size of catches. Thus, this activity depends on a variety of factors that add uncertainty to the profitability of fishing vessels. This study aims to estimate the probability of success and economic risk of "type vessels" under two different environmental variability scenarios in the Gulf of California. The results from the economic simulation pointed to the vessel type used in Guaymas (Sonora) as the most efficient one under a <b>neutral</b> <b>climate</b> change scenario, showing a homogeneous behaviour in physical characteristics and mode of operation. By contrast, under a scenario of a monotonic rise in sea surface temperature, the shrimp fishery faces a greater risk of incurring economic losses. The simulated climate behaviour scenarios revealed that the activity involves a moderate economic profitability under the neutral scenario; however, under the warming scenario, profitability may be low or even nil due to the risks and uncertainty resulting from the influence of environmental phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Large climate {{feedback}} uncertainties {{limit the}} prediction {{accuracy of the}} Earth s future climate with an increased CO 2 atmosphere. One potential to reduce the feedback uncertainties using satellite observations of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative energy imbalance is explored. Instead of solving the initial condition problem in previous energy balance analysis, current study focuses on the boundary condition problem with further considerations on climate system memory and deep ocean heat transport, which is more applicable for the climate. Along with surface temperature measurements of the present climate, the climate feedbacks are obtained based on {{the constraints of the}} TOA radiation imbalance. Comparing to the feedback factor of 3. 3 W/sq m/K of the <b>neutral</b> <b>climate</b> system, the estimated feedback factor for the current climate system ranges from - 1. 3 to - 1. 0 W/sq m/K with an uncertainty of +/- 0. 26 W/sq m/K. That is, a positive climate feedback is found because of the measured TOA net radiative heating (0. 85 W/sq m) to the climate system. The uncertainty is caused by the uncertainties in the climate memory length. The estimated time constant of the climate is large (70 to approx. 120 years), implying that the climate is not in an equilibrium state under the increasing CO 2 forcing in the last century...|$|R
40|$|Most {{industrial}} process plants consume {{large amounts of}} energy (usually {{in the form of}} steam and electricity) to produce demanded goods, such as beer or paper. However, combustion of fossil fuels has negative external effects on the Earths climate. In a climate change conscious economy such externalities can be addressed through incentive-based policy instruments. As a result, fossil fuel prices can be expected to increase, as well as prices for electricity and <b>climate</b> change <b>neutral</b> fuels such as biofuel. Many studies have shown the substantial potential for energy savings in process plants. Most process plants are energy market actors as a result of e. g. on-site electricity cogeneration, delivery of excess heat to district heating networks, or trading on emerging biofuel markets. Thus, energy projects at process plants will be affected by climate policy. This thesis addresses the issue of evaluating process industry energy projects given an uncertain, but climate conscious, development of the energy market. The perspective of industrial decision-making applies primarily. The main emphasis is put on development of analysis methods and tools, including classification of influencing parameters, systematic energy market scenario approaches, system boundary considerations, cost-effectiveness graphical tools for CO 2 reduction assessment, and a biofuel price-setting model adopting a constant electricity-to-biofuel price ratio for the Nordic countries. The thesis includes several applied studies conducted considering the Nordic energy market and its assumed climate conscious future development. The results show that energy projects in process plants can be cost-competitive compared to other measures for reducing CO 2 emissions in the Nordic countries. The results for specific studies of pulp mill energy systems indicate that biofuel saving measures in pulp mills are both economically competitive and robust and thus entail only a small risk with respect to uncertain development of future climate policy. It should, however, be noted that total CO 2 emissions associated with pulp mill biofuel savings may increase or decrease depending on the future development of the Nordic energy market. For industrial combined heat and power (CHP) the results are complex. The applied studies illustrate the importance of choice of emissions baseline for electricity and/or biofuel usage for determining the total CO 2 emissions consequences of energy projects...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} tested the {{potential}} for manipulating adolescents' goals and motives for participation in a school physical education (PE) lesson, and explored the subsequent outcomes on participant experience. Design: A cluster randomized controlled design {{was used to compare}} outcomes of four experimentally manipulated PE class conditions alongside a control group. Method: Twenty-four classes comprising 592 students (M age = 13. 74 years) were randomized to undertake one of four experimental conditions, or a control condition, during a fitness-based circuits class during a usual PE lesson. The experimental conditions comprised an autonomy-supportive or controlling climate, each with an intrinsic (health and fitness) or extrinsic (looking good to others) goal focus. The control condition comprised a <b>neutral</b> <b>climate</b> with no goal focus. The effect of experimental condition on motivational, affective, and intentional outcomes was analysed using hierarchical linear modelling. Results: Class-level effects explained less than 10 % of variance of study outcomes, suggesting that the impact of lesson manipulations was limited. Where intervention effects were significant, these were contrary to hypotheses guided by self-determination theory (SDT); participants perceived greater lesson value and formed stronger future intentions in the controlling, extrinsic goal focused condition. However, at the individual-level, findings were in line with SDT, in that perceptions of autonomy support and an intrinsic goal focus predicted positive lesson-related outcomes (i. e., motivation, effort, enjoyment, value, exercise-induced affect) and future intention to exercise (Total R 2 values =. 39 to. 75). Conclusions: The findings highlight the practical challenges of manipulating lesson climates in ecological PE settings...|$|R
40|$|Climate and litter quality are primary {{drivers of}} {{terrestrial}} decomposition and, {{based on evidence}} from multisite experiments at regional and global scales, are universally factored into global decomposition models. In contrast, soil animals are considered key regulators of decomposition at local scales but their role at larger scales is unresolved. Soil animals are consequently excluded from global models of organic mineralization processes. Incomplete assessment of the roles of soil animals stems from the difficulties of manipulating invertebrate animals experimentally across large geographic gradients. This is compounded by deficient or inconsistent taxonomy. We report a global decomposition experiment to assess the importance of soil animals in C mineralization, in which a common grass litter substrate was exposed to natural decomposition in either control or reduced animal treatments across 30 sites distributed from 43 °S to 68 °N on six continents. Animals in the mesofaunal size range were recovered from the litter by Tullgren extraction and identified to common specifications, mostly at the ordinal level. The design of the trials enabled faunal contribution to be evaluated against abiotic parameters between sites. Soil animals increase decomposition rates in temperate and wet tropical <b>climates,</b> but have <b>neutral</b> effects where temperature or moisture constrain biological activity. Our findings highlight that faunal influences on decomposition are dependent on prevailing climatic conditions. We conclude that (1) inclusion of soil animals will improve the predictive capabilities of region- or biome-scale decomposition models, (2) soil animal influences on decomposition are important at the regional scale when attempting to predict global change scenarios, and (3) the statistical relationship between decomposition rates and climate, at the global scale, is robust against changes in soil faunal abundance and diversity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Tropical climate {{imposes a}} high level of {{physiological}} stress, which could modify the target heart rate in training load prescription, as the recommendations are often determined by maximal oxygen uptake testing in temperature-neutral laboratories. To test this hypothesis, 7 highlevel cyclists performed two randomised maximal tests in neutral (19. 2 ± 0. 9 ◦C; 51. 7 ± 1. 3 % RH) and Tropical environment (25. 8 ± 1. 1 ◦C; 63. 7 ± 2. 3 % RH). Neither maximal oxygen uptake nor ventilatory threshold was influenced by the environmental conditions. However, ventilation (p < 0. 005) and the respiratory equivalent in O 2 (p < 0. 05) were significantly higher in the Tropical environment, whereas maximal power output and the time to attain maximal oxygen uptake were significantly lower (p < 0. 05 for both). Moreover, the ventilatory cost of cycling (expressed in LW− 1) was significantly greater in the Tropical condition (0. 40 ± 0. 03 LW− 1 vs. 0. 32 ± 0. 05 LW− 1, in Tropical vs. Neutral; condition effect: p < 0. 005; condition×time: p < 0. 001). Rectal temperature was influenced by neither the environmental conditions nor exercise (36. 7 ± 0. 1 and 37. 0 ± 0. 1 ◦Cvs. 36. 8 ± 0. 1 and 37. 1 ± 0. 2 ◦C, in Tropical vs. Neutral, before and after exercise) but was influenced by condition×time (p < 0. 05). The heart rate (HR) values usually used for training prescription were not significantly different (154 ± 5 bpm vs. 156 ± 4 bpm and 172 ± 4 bpm vs. 167 ± 4 bpm in Tropical vs. <b>Neutral</b> <b>climate,</b> for the first and second thresholds, respectively). We concluded that the usual parameters measured during maximal exercise to establish training programs are not impaired in moderate Tropical environment. Nevertheless, the thermal stress attested by the increased ventilatory cost of cycling could have prevented the cyclists from performing a true maximal test in Tropical conditions...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, city {{local governments}} focus their {{strategic}} vision {{on the development}} of the urban sustainability. For this, they develop drivers, strategies, structures on green local improvements. To be sustainable, cities reinforce actions and plans on resource management, mobility, climate, building and public spaces. In order to be sustainable and smart, challenges are set to ensure successful implementation of sustainable mobility strategies through the development of appropriate policies, actions, decisions and controls. The development of sustainable mobility strategy requires the involvement of strategic actors, infrastructures, funding and socio-demographic parameters. To ensure this, sustainable mobility strategy has to be strengthen by an efficient management control system and a real measurement of institutional factors’ risk. The development of mobility controls ensures homogeneity between behaviours, decisions, objectives and strategies for mobility issues. In order to make the link between control, strategy and sustainability, new researches propose new frameworks and systems. These frameworks reinforce the strategic contribution of values, rules, monitoring and enhancing awareness and interactions. Based on that, the management control framework of Malmi and Brown is more and more associated with the implementation of sustainable strategies. This paper explores the development of sustainable mobility strategies in two Belgian cities (Namur and Leuven). To analyse how cilty local governments implement, control and develop mobility strategies and plans, this paper refers to Malmi and Brown’s model. The research proposes two hypotheses that set the importance of the integration of an adequate sustainable mobility control system and the institutional factors on the design and the use of mobility strategy control. This paper proposes a new conceptual model to support the development of sustainable mobility strategy. For this, the choice of two Belgian cities is made according to similarities (population size, explicit will to develop sustainable mobility strategy, focus on sustainable transport, initiation period of mobility issues’ implementation, number of person in charge of mobility, level of willingness to develop mobility system, focus on car free and strategic mobility challenges) and differences (region, language, regulative factors, normative factors and cognitive factors). To test our conceptual framework, an explorative qualitative case study is done in these two Belgian city local governments. The data collection requires a fieldwork of 12 weeks, 54 internal and external documents, and 20 semi-structured interviews (mobility managers, politicians, sustainability managers, policemen and administrative workers). Results shows differences between the implementation and development of Namur and Leuven. Leuven has an average quality of sustainable mobility control system. Leuven requires developing new adapted indicators to face new city challenges and more effective collaborations between involved departments and actors. The case of Namur shows that its sustainable mobility control system is weak because of the non-adapted indicators to strategy and the weakness of the formal structure of mobility strategy. Results identify different institutional factors that have a significant impact {{on the development of}} sustainable mobility strategy; the most relevant are formal regulations, political power, local cultures, support of direct and indirect actors and the sensitiveness on sustainable culture. The proposed conceptual model also highlights if the impact of mobility strategy controls and institutional influences have a weak, medium or strong impact on the development of mobility strategy. Results validate our proposed conceptual model. However, this model has to be tested on other sustainability issues (energy, green building, green housing, green and <b>neutral</b> <b>climate),</b> cities and regions...|$|R
