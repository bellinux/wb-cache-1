Operational conditions were a significant wave height of 6. 0 ft, wind <b>velocity</b> of 30 <b>knots,</b> I and a <b>current</b> <b>velocity</b> of 2 <b>knots.</b> The mooring system was designed for operation in a minimum depth of 30 ft and a maximum depth of 45 ft. The following operational criteria were also required for the mooring design: (a) transportation by truck or rail, (b) rapid assembly {{with little or no}} diver support, and (c) installation with a minimum of lift support. The report examines five alternatives: (a) a guyed tower, tension leg platform (TLP), (b) a single anchor mooring (SALM), (c) a three-leg catenary anchor leg mooring (CALM), and (d) a four-leg CALM. The four-leg CALM was selected for further study because it best met the operational criteria. To accommodate truck transport, a 28 -ft-long, I 1 -ft 6 -in. -high, 7 -ft 6 -in. -deep capsule buoy was designed.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{data processing}} schemes for extracting Earth-referenced <b>current</b> <b>velocity</b> from relative <b>current</b> <b>velocity</b> measurement {{made by an}} Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) borne by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Compared with conventional approaches, current profiling from an AUV platform has advantages including three-dimensional mobility, rapid response, high-level intelligent control, independence from ship motion and weather constraint, and shallow water operation. First, an acausal postprocessing scheme is presented for estimating the AUV's own velocity and removing it from the relative velocity measurement to obtain the true <b>current</b> <b>velocity.</b> Then, a causal scheme for estimating the Earth-referenced <b>current</b> <b>velocity</b> is presented. The causal algorithm {{is based on an}} Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that utilizes the hydrodynamics connecting <b>current</b> <b>velocity</b> to vehicle's motion. In both methods, the raw ADCP measurement is corrected to achieve more accurate <b>current</b> <b>velocity</b> estimate. Field data from the Haro Strait Tidal Front Experiment are processed by both methods. <b>Current</b> <b>velocity</b> estimation results reveal horizontal and vertical velocity structure of the tidal mixing process, and are also consistent with the vehicle's deviated trajectory.

40|$|Abstract Background and Purpose: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of <b>current</b> <b>velocity</b> on diatom colonization rate during the first 30 days of artificial substrate (glass slides) exposure. Materials and Methods: From autumn 1990 to summer 1993 artificial substrates were submerged in an unpolluted mountain stream. The parallel oriented glass slides (against the surface) were placed 10 cm beneath thewater surface (protected from debris) and exposed to different <b>current</b> <b>velocities</b> (10 – 30 cm s– 1, 40 – 60 cm s– 1 and 80 – 100 cm s– 1). The samples were collected seasonally. To define diatom colonization, a nonlinear regressive analysis of empirical data was performed. Results: A total of 71 diatom species were found. Species Cocconeis placentula, Surirella ovata, Gomphonema olivaceum, and Navicula gracilis were the most abundant, depending on different <b>current</b> <b>velocity.</b> Conclusions: The time needed for reaching the equilibrium progressively increased with the <b>current</b> <b>velocity</b> (F= 16. 7; P< 0. 01).

However, as migration requires energy, the timing of migration may depend not only on differences in habitat quality, but also on temporal variation in migration costs. Such variation can, for instance, arise from changes in wind or <b>current</b> <b>velocity</b> for migrating birds and fish, respectively. Whereas behavioural responses of birds to such changing environmental conditions have been relatively well described, {{this is not the}} case for fish, although fish migrations are both ecologically and economically important.

Crayfish are {{considered}} "ecosystem engineers" because they manipulate environments and can profoundly affect the aquatic ecosystems {{in which they}} live (Creed & Reed 2004). Crayfish also affect the composition of benthic stream communities by altering habitats (Hansen 2013) and modifying trophic relationships and food web structure (Bobeldyk & Lamberti 2010, Larsen 2013).

The extent to which crayfish impact macroinvertebrates may be dependent on environmental factors in the stream, such as <b>current</b> <b>velocity</b> (Creed 2004). <b>Current</b> <b>velocity</b> is a particularly important factor as it defines stream ecosystems and many benthic organisms respond to its influence.

Site 1, situated {{at the edge of the}} flat, had a dense algal mat but low sediment stability. Microalgae were readily resuspended because the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by the migratory diatoms were unable to consolidate during the short emersion period. As a rule more chl a was resuspended from sandy sediments at <b>current</b> <b>velocities</b> 15 and 20 cm- 1, but above this <b>current</b> <b>velocity</b> chl a resuspension was greater from silty sediments. Although sandy sites have low biomass in the surface layer, the greater depth of sediment erosion during bedload transport exposes more chl a to the surface. The percentage of sedimentary chl a lost at selected <b>current</b> <b>velocities</b> was estimated, and the implications for carbon supply to the pelagic and benthic systems discussed. Much of the biomass resuspended may be deposited locally, particularly in sandier regions. During the flume experiments it was observed that settling of fine sediment and microalgae was extremely rapid, because it was being biodeposited by suspension-feeding activity, and 'stripped' out of the water column by rapidly sinking suspended particulate matter (SPM). Qualitative changes in suspended material were measured as % chl a (chl a/phaeopigments ¥ 100 %) and accessory pigment content. As <b>current</b> <b>velocity</b> increased the relative proportion of phaeopigments increased, which has important implications for benthic suspension feeders feeding in the benthic boundary layer. The findings from the flume experiments have been compared with in situ measurements of <b>current</b> <b>velocity,</b> SPM and chl a...|$|R
