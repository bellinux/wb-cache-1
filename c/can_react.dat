5|$|Hot, {{concentrated}} {{selenic acid}} <b>can</b> <b>react</b> with gold to form gold(III) selenate.|$|E
5|$|H2 {{reacts with}} every {{oxidizing}} element. Hydrogen <b>can</b> <b>react</b> spontaneously and violently {{at room temperature}} with chlorine and fluorine to form the corresponding hydrogen halides, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride, which are also potentially dangerous acids.|$|E
5|$|However, {{in these}} {{reactions}} the regenerating hydrogen <b>can</b> <b>react</b> with the metal, forming the corresponding hydride. Uranium reacts with acids and water {{much more easily}} than thorium.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{presence}} of waterglass (soluble K-polysiloxonate), one gets the creation of ortho-sialate-disiloxo cyclic structure (e.g. #5 in the figure), whereby the hydroxide is liberated by condensation reactions and <b>can</b> <b>reacts</b> again; ...|$|R

5|$|Zinc oxide <b>can</b> <b>react</b> violently with {{aluminium}} {{and magnesium}} powders, with chlorinated rubber and linseed oil on heating causing fire and explosion hazard.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids <b>can</b> <b>react</b> to form amide bonds, one amino acid molecule <b>can</b> <b>react</b> with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields {{the newly formed}} peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
5|$|In {{collections}} {{which contain}} fossils, high humidity can also affect pyrite (or its more reactive polymorph marcasite) (iron sulphide) fossils {{in a somewhat}} similar condition, which is known as pyrite disease. The iron sulfide <b>can</b> <b>react</b> with water and oxygen to form iron sulfates and sulfuric acid, which then can produce Bynesian decay.|$|E
50|$|Adipoyl {{chloride}} <b>can</b> be <b>reacted</b> with hexamethylenediamine to form nylon 6,6.|$|R

5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} can {{be produced}} from their constituent ions by evaporation, precipitation, or freezing. Reactive metals such as the alkali metals <b>can</b> <b>react</b> directly with the highly electronegative halogen gases to form an ionic product. They can also be synthesized {{as the product of}} a high temperature reaction between solids.|$|E
5|$|Further {{purification}} {{is done by}} {{a chemical}} transport reaction developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer. In a closed vessel, the metal reacts with iodine at temperatures above 500°C forming metal(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of nearly 2000°C the reverse reaction happens and the iodine and metal are set free. The metal forms a solid coating on the tungsten filament and the iodine <b>can</b> <b>react</b> with additional metal resulting in a steady turnover.|$|E
5|$|Further {{purification}} is {{effected by}} a chemical transport reaction developed by Arkel and de Boer: In a closed vessel, hafnium reacts with iodine at temperatures of 500°C, forming hafnium(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of 1700°C the reverse reaction happens, and the iodine and hafnium are set free. The hafnium forms a solid coating at the tungsten filament, and the iodine <b>can</b> <b>react</b> with additional hafnium, {{resulting in a}} steady turn over.|$|E
50|$|Mercuric nitrate <b>can</b> be <b>reacted</b> with {{elemental}} mercury to form mercurous nitrate.|$|R

5|$|Like many powders, {{dysprosium}} powder {{may present}} an explosion hazard when {{mixed with air}} and when an ignition source is present. Thin foils of the substance can also be ignited by sparks or by static electricity. Dysprosium fires cannot be put out by water. It <b>can</b> <b>react</b> with water to produce flammable hydrogen gas. Dysprosium chloride fires, however, can be extinguished with water, while dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are non-flammable. Dysprosium nitrate, Dy(NO3)3, is a strong oxidizing agent and will readily ignite on contact with organic substances.|$|E
5|$|Uranium metal {{reacts with}} almost all {{non-metal}} elements (with {{the exception of}} the noble gases) and their compounds, with reactivity increasing with temperature. Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium, but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly. When finely divided, it <b>can</b> <b>react</b> with cold water; in air, uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide. Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry.|$|E
5|$|Molten salts will solidify on cooling {{to below}} their {{freezing}} point. This is sometimes {{used for the}} solid-state synthesis of complex ionic compounds from solid reactants, which are first melted together. In other cases, the solid reactants {{do not need to}} be melted, but instead <b>can</b> <b>react</b> through a solid-state reaction route. In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in the oven. Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct stoichiometric ratio of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other species.|$|E

5|$|They {{continue}} {{toward the}} homestead, intending {{to return to}} the gas station once it has received a fuel delivery. When they arrive, Franklin tells Kirk and Pam about a local swimming-hole and the couple head off to find it. They stumble upon a nearby house. Kirk calls out for gas, entering through the unlocked door, while Pam waits outside. Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) appears and kills Kirk with a hammer. Pam enters soon after and trips into a room filled with furniture made from human bones. She attempts to flee, but Leatherface catches her and impales her on a meathook, making her watch as he butchers Kirk with a chainsaw. Jerry heads out to look for Pam and Kirk at sunset. He sees the house and finds Pam, still alive, inside a freezer. Before he <b>can</b> <b>react,</b> Leatherface kills him.|$|E
5|$|With 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2 d6 (see diagram at right) Black {{wants to}} open the {{diagonal}} a1–h8 for his queen. After 6.exd6 Qf6 White <b>can</b> <b>react</b> to the attack on his Bf4 in several ways, the best one being 7.Nh3 to develop a piece and protect both the Bf4 and the f2-pawn. It also helps that the Bf4 is still guarding the Nd2, so that after 7...Qxb2? {{there is not the}} threat of winning the exchange (8...Bxd2+ would be answered by 9.Bxd2) and White can repel Black's attack with 8.Rb1 Qa3 9.Rb3 Qa5 10.dxc7 Nc6 11.a3! Be7 12.e3. Instead, Black must play energetically with 7...Nxf2 8.Kxf2 Bxh3 9.g3 Bxf1 10.dxc7!? Nc6 11.Rxf1 and here Lalic recommends 11...0-0 12.Kg2 Rfe8.|$|E
5|$|Blue dinitrogen {{trioxide}} (N2O3) is only {{available as a}} solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide <b>can</b> <b>react</b> by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. This is {{because it is a}} hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.|$|E

5|$|The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) in NOLF was significantly advanced {{at the time}} of the game's release. Enemy AI <b>can</b> <b>react</b> to eleven different stimuli, including hearing the player's footsteps or weapon firing, seeing the player's footprints in the snow, or hearing an ally scream in pain. The AI can try and investigate the source of these stimuli, by following the footprints for example, and can sound alarms or call for backup. During combat, the AI finds cover positions, and, to some extent, can also use its environment for protection, such as flipping over a table and hiding behind it. After advancing AI technology in their subsequent games, Monolith likened the way NOLFs AIs pop randomly in and out of cover to a shooting gallery. Groups of AI guards make use of a group logic when investigating and combating the player. For example, one guard might start firing at the player, while another runs and calls for backup. The game's AI includes friendly and enemy humans, as well as dogs, sharks, and helicopters.|$|E
