Davis promised a return to the company’s <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> after a period in which the firm had expanded rapidly, which some McKinsey consultants felt was a departure from the company's heritage. Also in 2003, the firm established a headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region in Shanghai, China. By 2004, more than 60 percent of McKinsey's revenues were generated outside the U.S. The company started a Social Sector Office (SSO) in 2008, which is divided into three practices: Global Public Health, Economic Development and Opportunity Creation (EDHOC) and Philanthropy. McKinsey does much of its pro-bono work through the SSO, whereas a Business Technology Office (BTO), founded in 1997, provides consulting on technology strategy.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did not {{consistently}} vote with either the Democratic or the newly formed Whig Party, though he revered President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat and Tennessean. The major parties were still determining their <b>core</b> <b>values</b> and policy proposals, with the party system {{in a state of}} flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation. After Brookins Campbell and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County. Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.|$|E

40|$|The least <b>core</b> <b>value</b> of a {{cooperative}} game is the minimum penalty {{we need to}} charge a coalition for defecting that ensures {{the existence of a}} fair and efficient cost allocation. The set of all such cost allocations is called the least core. In this paper, we study the computational complexity and algorithmic aspects of computing the least <b>core</b> <b>value</b> of supermodular cost cooperative games, and uncover some structural properties of the least core of these games. We motivate the study of these games by showing that a particular class of optimization problems has supermodular optimal costs. This class includes a variety of problems in combinatorial optimization, especially in machine scheduling. We show that com-puting the least <b>core</b> <b>value</b> of supermodular cost cooperative games is NP-hard, and build a framework to approximate the least <b>core</b> <b>value</b> of these games using oracles that approximately determine maximally violated constraints. With recent work on maximizing submodular functions, our framework yields a (3 +) -approximation algorithm for computing the least <b>core</b> <b>value</b> of general supermodular cost games. We also apply our approximation framework to two particular classes of cooperative games: schedule planning games and matroid profit games. Schedule planning games are cooperative games in which the cost to a coalition is derived from the minimum sum of weighted completion times on a single machine. By specializing some of the results for general supermodular cost cooperative games, we are able to show that the Shapley value is an element of the least core of schedule planning games, and design a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for computing the least <b>core</b> <b>value</b> of these games. Matroid profit games are cooperative games with submodular profits: the profit to a coalition arises from the maximum weight of a matroid basis. We show that an element of the least core and the least <b>core</b> <b>value</b> of matroid profit games can be computed in polynomial time...|$|R

25|$|The {{ideal self}} and real self involve {{understanding}} {{the issues that}} arise from having {{an idea of what}} you wish you were as a person, and having that not match with who you actually are as a person (incongruence). The ideal self is what a person believes should be done, as well as what their <b>core</b> <b>values</b> are. The real self is what is actually played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. It is much easier to trust someone who is willing to share feelings openly, even if it may not be what the client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.|$|E
40|$|We apply {{ideas from}} {{cooperative}} game theory to study {{situations in which}} a set of agents face supermodular costs. These situations appear {{in a variety of}} scheduling contexts, as well as in some settings related to facility location and network design. Intuitively, cooperation amongst rational agents who face supermodular costs is unlikely. However, in circumstances where the failure to cooperate may lead to negative externalities, one might be interested in methods of encouraging cooperation. The least <b>core</b> <b>value</b> of a cooperative game is the minimum penalty we need to charge a coalition for acting independently that encourages cooperation by ensuring the existence of an efficient and stable cost allocation. The set of all such cost allocations is called the least core. In this work, we study the computational complexity and approximability of computing the least <b>core</b> <b>value</b> of supermodular cost cooperative games. We show that computing the least <b>core</b> <b>value</b> of supermodular cost cooperative games is strongly NP-hard, and build a framework to approximate the least <b>core</b> <b>value</b> of these games using oracles that approximately determine maximally violated constraints. This framework yields a $(3 +epsilon) $-approximation algorithm for computing the least <b>core</b> <b>value</b> of supermodular cost cooperative games. As a by-product, we show how to compute accompanying approximate least core cost allocations for these games. We also apply our approximation framework to obtain better results for two particular classes of supermodular cost cooperative games that arise from scheduling and matroid optimization...|$|R

25|$|Although most fusion {{research}} {{to date has}} focused on the nature and consequences of fusion, recent research has revealed some starting points for understanding the causes of fusion. Perceptions of shared essence, the belief that one shares essential core qualities with the group, appears to be a key building block of identity fusion. Perceptions of shared essence arise in different ways in local and extended fusion. In local fusion, individuals have direct experiences with other group members that foster the conclusion that they share essential qualities with those individuals. In extended fusion, the perception of psychological kinship is fostered by the presence of certain characteristics that are perceived as fundamental to who the person is. For example, {{people are more likely to}} fuse with large extended groups when they become convinced that members of the group share with them genes or <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> especially if they hold those values sacred.|$|E

One overriding goal has been to break down the barriers between the University's 17 school's and colleges that had evolved over the decades and find ways to combine different fields and researchers within interdisciplinary research centers. This philosophy of creating new knowledge from a variety of corners of the University extends to undergraduate education, as well, which has been overhauled to expose students to new fields and ways of thinking and problem solving. This includes requiring course work outside their majors, development of personal communications skills, and cross-school collaborations.
