5|$|A {{town meeting}} is held to discuss Mr. Burns' actions. Mr. Burns arrives, {{armed with a}} gun after his {{encounter}} with Homer. Despite the whole town standing up to him, he activates the sun-blocking device, thinking himself invincible. He walks into an alley, obscured from view, and struggles with someone until a gunshot is heard. He stumbles out into the open, wounded, and collapses on the town's sundial. The townspeople find him and Marge tells all of them that since Mr. Burns has angered so many people recently, just about anyone <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> shooter.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the contradictions}} within Ramesside king lists {{and the lack}} of contemporary, festive inscriptions, the exact chronological {{position}} of Khaba remains disputed. Egyptologist Nabil Swelim believes that Khaba <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> direct successor to King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the 2nd dynasty. He bases his assumptions on similarities between the two's names: both begin with the syllable kha. As a comparison, he points to the names Netjerikhet (Djoser) and Sekhemkhet (Djoserteti), which also display such similarity and are widely assumed to have ruled back-to-back.|$|E

50|$|According to Frederick Howard Wines in {{his book}} Punishment and Reformation: A Study Of The Penitentiary System there were three main types of {{coercion}} employed in the torture chamber: Coercion by the cord, by water and by fire. There were five stages of torture that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> applied to <b>the</b> accused: he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> threatened with torture, he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> taken to <b>the</b> torture chamber and <b>been</b> shown <b>the</b> instruments, he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> undressed as if in preparation to <b>be</b> tied to <b>the</b> instrument, without actually being tied, he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tied to <b>the</b> instrument of torture but not actually getting tortured and finally he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tied to <b>the</b> instrument and tortured.|$|R

Edmund's mother was {{probably}} Ealdgyth, Edmund Ironside's wife; {{it is possible}} that she was only his stepmother, as the king's death in November 1016 left space of only one year for two children to be born. Although {{there is a possibility that}} Edmund was older than his brother, later known as Edward the Exile, it is also possible that they were twins. At the time, it was customary for posthumous sons to bear their father's name; thus, Edmund <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> younger, posthumous son.|$|E
5|$|For long afterwards, Grant and Buell quarreled over Grant's {{decision}} not to mount an immediate pursuit with another hour of daylight remaining. Grant cited the exhaustion of his troops, although the Confederates were certainly just as exhausted. Part of Grant's reluctance to act <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> unusual command relationship he had with Buell. Although Grant was the senior officer and technically was in command of both armies, Buell made it quite clear throughout the two days that he was acting independently.|$|E
5|$|From the 12th {{century the}} manor of Muchland was {{administered}} from Aldingham Castle. Muchland {{became known as}} Aldingham manor and in 1291 it came into the ownership of the Harrington family. In the 14th century, the Scots attacked the Furness peninsula during the Scottish Wars of Independence; {{around the same time}} coastal erosion threatened Aldingham Motte. These factors may have led to the Harrington family abandoning Aldingham and establishing the administrative centre of the manor at the newly built Gleaston Castle, though the construction work <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> result of their growing social status, and they may have needed more room for a greater number of servants.|$|E

5|$|However, with Moltke crippled, Admiral Scheer {{decided to}} return to base. Though {{scouting}} units of the Grand Fleet made brief contact with the Germans on the morning of 25 April, no action followed, and the High Seas Fleet made it home without incident. At one point in the chase, however, a reversal of course by the Germans meant that the entire Grand Fleet was forced to reorient itself in the opposite direction, placing Battleship Division Nine in the van. The result was that, if an encounter between the two fleets had occurred, American battleships would have led the British fleet into what <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> largest naval battle of the war.|$|E
5|$|One {{argument}} leveled by Westmoreland at {{the time}} (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several NVA divisions. But, {{at the time}} Hanoi {{made the decision to}} move in around the base, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. It is debatable whether the destruction of one battalion <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> goal of two to four NVA divisions. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops—nearly fifty maneuver battalions—to I Corps.|$|E
5|$|Schwimmer {{concluded}} in 2002 that the feeding patterns of Deinosuchus most likely varied by geographic location; the smaller Deinosuchus specimens of eastern North America {{would have been}} opportunistic feeders in an ecological niche {{similar to that of}} the modern American alligator. They would have consumed marine turtles, large fish, and smaller dinosaurs. The bigger, but less common, Deinosuchus that lived in Texas and Montana might have been more specialized hunters, capturing and eating large dinosaurs. Schwimmer noted no theropod dinosaurs in Deinosuchuss eastern range approached its size, indicating the massive crocodilian <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> region's apex predator.|$|E

5|$|The Israeli embassy {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} on March 17, 1992. It was perceived {{as a consequence of}} Argentina's involvement in the Gulf War. Although Hezbollah claimed responsibility for it, the Supreme Court investigated several other hypotheses. The Court wrote a report in 1996 suggesting that it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> explosion of an arms cache stored in the basement. Another hypothesis was that the attack could have been performed by Jewish extremists, in order to cast blame on Muslims and thwart the peace negotiations. The Court finally held Hezbollah responsible for the attack in May 1999.|$|E
5|$|The fire on {{the boat}} deck {{penetrated}} to a magazine. Evidence given to the second board indicated that the doors for the 4-inch ammunition supply trunks were closed throughout the action. It remains possible that a door or trunk could have been opened up by an enemy shell, admitting flames to the magazine. Alternative routes for admission of flame <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> ventilation or venting arrangements of the magazines or, as Ted Briggs suggested, through {{the floor of a}} 15-inch gunhouse.|$|E
5|$|Work on the {{new house}} began in 1685. The {{architect}} {{thought to have been}} responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.|$|E

5|$|A {{skeleton}} of the hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus annectens {{has been described}} from Montana with healed tyrannosaur-inflicted damage on its tail vertebrae. The fact that the damage seems to have healed suggests that the Edmontosaurus survived a tyrannosaur's attack on a living target, i.e. the tyrannosaur had attempted active predation. There is also evidence for an aggressive interaction between a Triceratops and a Tyrannosaurus {{in the form of}} partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a Triceratops brow horn and squamosal (a bone of the neck frill); the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. It is not known what the exact nature of the interaction was, though: either animal <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> aggressor. Since the Triceratops wounds healed, it is most likely that the Triceratops survived the encounter and managed to overcome the Tyrannosaurus. Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that in a battle against a bull Triceratops, the Triceratops had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the Tyrannosaurus using its sharp horns.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{presented}} by an expert {{shortly after the}} crash theorized that an engine fire <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> catalyst of the accident. Under this theory, {{one of the two}} engines on the right wing may have caught fire. Shrapnel from the engine may have punctured the fuselage, causing explosive decompression. Alternatively, Julian Frank, who was known to be desperately afraid of flying, may have panicked and hit the window, weakening it such that it subsequently blew out. Under this theory, the pilots and passengers would have been aware of an emergency aboard, which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing. This theory was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to disintegrating and crashing, as well as {{the fact that some of}} the passengers were found wearing life jackets.|$|E
5|$|The Royalists, while losing fewer soldiers, {{were now}} in a {{precarious}} position, since reinforcements from Chester were needed {{to follow up on}} the success and defeat Poyntz's force. As such, Langdale sent Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Shakerley to report to Charles, requesting reinforcements. Shakerley arrived in Chester and delivered his message after 15 minutes, but no orders were issued for a further six hours after that. Barratt speculates that one reason <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> fatigue of the Royalist troops, and another the rivalries amongst the Royalist commanders: Gerard and Digby opposed each other, with other commanders disliking Langdale; and Charles not being strong enough to stop the disputes. The Parliamentarians, however, did send support: at approximately 2:00pm, the Chester forces dispatched 350 horse and 400 musketeers under Colonels Michael Jones and John Booth to reinforce Poyntz.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{in the age}} of Augustus (r. 27 BC – 14 AD), {{the ancient}} Romans, {{including}} authors such as Pliny the Elder, mentioned contacts with the Seres, who they identified as the producers of silk from distant East Asia and <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> Chinese or even any number of middlemen of various ethnic backgrounds along the Silk Road of Central Asia and Northwest China. The Eastern-Han era Chinese general Ban Chao, Protector General of the Western Regions, explored Central Asia and in 97 AD dispatched his envoys Gan Ying to Daqin (i.e. the Roman Empire). Gan was dissuaded by Parthian authorities to venture further than the Persian Gulf, although he wrote a detailed report about the Roman Empire, its cities, postal network, and consular system of government, and presented this to the Han court. Subsequently, there were a series of Roman embassies in China lasting from the 2nd to 3rd centuries AD, as recorded in Chinese sources. In 166 AD the Book of Later Han records that Romans reached China from the maritime south and presented gifts to the court of Emperor Huan of Han (r. 146–168 AD), claiming they represented Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (Andun 安敦) (r. 161–180 AD). Historian Rafe de Crespigny speculates that they were Roman merchants instead of official diplomats.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{to regain}} for himself the kingdom lost by his {{half-brother}} Olaf Haraldsson, Harald began his journey westwards in early 1045, departing from Novgorod (Holmgard) to Staraya Ladoga (Aldeigjuborg) where he obtained a ship. His journey went through Lake Ladoga, down the Neva River, {{and then into}} the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea. He arrived in Sigtuna in Sweden, probably at the end of 1045 or in early 1046. When he arrived in Sweden, according to the skald Tjodolv Arnorsson, his ship was unbalanced by its heavy load of gold. In Harald's absence, the throne of Norway had been restored to Magnus the Good, an illegitimate son of Olaf. Harald may actually have known this, and it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> reason why Harald wanted to return to Norway in the first place. Since Cnut the Great's sons had chosen to abandon Norway and instead fight over England, and his sons and successors Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut had died young, Magnus's position as king had been secured. No domestic threats or insurrections are recorded to have occurred during his eleven-year reign. After the death of Harthacnut, which had left the Danish throne vacant, Magnus had in addition been selected to be the king of Denmark, and managed to defeat the Danish royal pretender Sweyn Estridsson.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} of has both been credited to Barry O'Neil and/or Lloyd B. Carleton by film historian Q. David Bowers. It {{is not known}} for certain who directed or if both them played a directorial {{a role in the}} production. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. The confusion between the directing credits stems from the industry practice of not crediting the film directors, even in studio news releases. There is also dispute over the cameraman credit for the film. Bower credits Blair Smith as the cameraman, but the American Film Institute adds that Carl Louis Gregory also <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> cameraman. Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. Bowers believes that numerous releases were produced with Gregory operating the camera, but the role was uncredited in the 1910 era. Anna Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for {{the first year of the}} company. Rosemond joined in the autumn of 1909 and in their first year of productions. Frank H. Crane was involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company from 1909. Crane's was the first leading man of the company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser.|$|E
