40|$|This thesis {{examines}} a local activist {{group in}} the rural town of Belle Glade, Florida during the late 1960 s and early 1970 s. This research falls in line with many New Black Power studies. These New Black Power studies challenge existing notions of the Black Power and <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>eras</b> {{and their relationship to}} one another. It challenges the time frames, geography and ideology of both of the eras. This case study of a the group in Belle Glade is not the first to examine the similarities of the Black Power and <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>eras,</b> where many groups who affiliated with the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement and shifted towards Black Power tactics, it does present an interesting dynamic of a group which self-identified as a Black Power group to an approach more associated with the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement. The methods used in the in studying the COBY, the moniker of the group, included archival research from newspapers and city commission meeting minutes. Additionally, ethnographic research methods were also used in the form of personal interviews. This thesis will add to the scholarship of New Black Power studies by providing another example of groups in history which challenge existing notions of two distinct movements in the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> and Black Power eras...|$|R

25|$|Although Baltimore {{had a large}} free black {{population}} established before the American Civil War, it was a southern city that maintained de facto racial segregation. The police department was dominated by ethnic whites, {{many of whom were}} descendants of 19th and 20th century immigrants, well into the mid-20th century. During the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>era</b> of the late 1950s and 1960s, blacks argued to gain more positions in the police department {{in order to have a}} force that better reflected the demographics of the city, where they were a large minority.|$|E

5000|$|For {{those born}} after World War II, the {{emergence}} of television {{as a source of}} entertainment and information—as well as the associated massive expansion of consumerism afforded by post-war affluence and encouraged by TV advertising—were key components in creating disillusionment for some younger people and in the formulation of new social behaviours, even as ad agencies heavily courted the [...] "hip" [...] youth market. In the US, nearly real-time TV news coverage of the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>era's</b> Birmingham Campaign, the [...] "Bloody Sunday" [...] event of the Selma to Montgomery marches, and graphic news footage from Vietnam brought horrifying, moving images of the bloody reality of armed conflict into living rooms for the first time.|$|R
25|$|In {{the social}} changes around the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>era,</b> between 1965 and 1982 many Choctaw Native Americans renewed their {{commitments}} {{to the value}} of their ancient heritage. Working to celebrate their own strengths and exercise appropriate rights; they dramatically reversed the trend toward abandonment of Indian culture and tradition. During the 1960s, Community Action programs connected with Native Americans were based on citizen participation. In the 1970s, the Choctaw repudiated the extremes of Indian activism. The Oklahoma Choctaw sought a local grassroots solution to reclaim their cultural identity and sovereignty as a nation. The Mississippi Choctaw would lay the foundations of business ventures.|$|E
25|$|Black-White {{segregation}} {{is consistently}} declining for most metropolitan areas and cities, {{though there are}} geographical differences. In 2000, for instance, the US Census Bureau found that residential segregation has on average declined since 1980 in the West and South, but less so in the Northeast and Midwest. Indeed, the top ten most segregated cities are in the Rust Belt, where total populations have declined {{in the last few}} decades. Despite these pervasive patterns, changes for individual areas are sometimes small. Thirty years after the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>era,</b> the United States remains a residentially segregated society in which blacks and whites still often inhabit vastly different neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|During the Nixon years (and {{through the}} 1970s), the liberal {{consensus}} {{began to come}} apart {{with the election of}} Ronald Reagan marking the election of the first non-Keynsian administration and the first application of supply-side economics. The alliance with white Southern Democrats had been lost in the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>era.</b> While the steady enfranchisement of African Americans expanded the electorate to include many new voters sympathetic to liberal views, it was not quite enough {{to make up for the}} loss of some Southern Democrats. A tide of conservatism rose in response to perceived failures of liberal policies. Organized labor, long a bulwark of the liberal consensus, was past the peak of its power in the US and many unions had remained in favor of the Vietnam War even as liberal politicians increasingly turned against it.|$|E
50|$|Miller {{develops}} a team named Black American Racers, Inc. (BAR), which fields African-American second-generation driver Benny Scott. The team endures corporate sponsorship rejection, due to prejudices and disbelief {{that a black}} team could be competitive in auto racing. After securing sponsorship from Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, BAR enters Formula Super Vee and Formula 5000 races on America’s road racing circuits. The team {{makes it to the}} Long Beach Grand Prix in the mid-1970s. Nevertheless, after two years, Brown & Williamson ends its sponsorship programs around the world in auto racing, and BAR is unable to replace the sponsorship. This leads Miller to field a team independently with African-American driver Tommy Thompson, who lost his life in a race in 1978. Subsequently, Miller has continued to field teams in NASCAR. Challenges similar to those he faced during the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>eras</b> have continued to resurface, and Miller describes these in the book.|$|R

25|$|In one {{particularly}} controversial 1965 incident, white civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo {{was murdered by}} Ku Klux Klansmen, who gave chase and fired shots into her car after noticing that her passenger was a young black man; one of the Klansmen was Gary Thomas Rowe, an acknowledged FBI informant. The FBI spread rumors that Liuzzo {{was a member of}} the Communist Party and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with African Americans involved in the Civil Rights Movement. FBI records show that J. Edgar Hoover personally communicated these insinuations to President Johnson. FBI informant Rowe has also been implicated in some of the most violent crimes of the 1960s <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>era,</b> including attacks on the Freedom Riders and the 1963 Birmingham, Alabama 16th Street Baptist Church bombing.|$|E
25|$|From 2000 to 2010, the United States Census Bureau {{reported}} that Mississippi {{had the highest}} rate of increase in people identifying as mixed-race, up 70 percent in the decade; it amounts to a total of 1.1 percent of the population. In addition, Mississippi led the nation {{for most of the last}} decade in the growth of mixed marriages among its population. The total population has not increased significantly, but is young. Some of the above change in identification as mixed race is due to new births. But, it appears mostly to reflect those residents who have chosen to identify as more than one race, who in earlier years may have identified by just one ethnicity. A binary racial system had been in place since slavery times and the days of racial segregation. In the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>era,</b> people of African descent banded together in an inclusive community to achieve political power and gain restoration of their civil rights.|$|E

40|$|There {{seems to}} be a broad {{consensus}} that Title II of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1964, which prohibits race discrimination in “place[s] of public accommodation,” was a remarkable success. But the consensus is illusory. Laws prohibiting discrimination by public accommodations currently exist under a significant legal threat. And this threat is merely the latest iteration in the controversy over public accommodations laws that began as early as Reconstruction. This Article begins by discussing the controversy in the Reconstruction and <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Eras</b> over the penetration of antidiscrimination principles into the realm of private businesses’ choice of customers. Although the controversy was discussed in the earlier era in the terms of <b>civil</b> versus social <b>rights,</b> and in the later era in the terms of property, contract, and association, the same fundamental concerns motivated objections to public accommodations laws in both periods. The paper then turns to the current controversy. It begins by discussing Rand Paul’s 2010 comments questioning whether public accommodations laws are consistent with libertarian principles, as well as the harsh response those comments drew from prominent libertarian commentators. It shows that Paul’s libertarian opponents disagreed with him only on pragmatic, not principled, grounds. The Article then turns to an analysis of Boy Scouts v. Dale and of recent developments that promise to undermine the expressive/commercial distinction that has kept Dale from threatening the core of public accommodations law...|$|R

40|$|This {{book was}} created {{as part of}} a multi-year {{historic}} archeological project sponsored by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and under the direction of Dr. Scott Pletka and Jon Budd. The project was initiated because of federal and state laws that require consideration of cultural resources that may be impacted by development. The project involved archival research, oral history, and archeological investigations at a site called the Ransom and Sarah Williams farmstead in southern Travis County, Texas. An African American family occupied the farmstead beginning in 1871, and perhaps earlier, through about 1905. This book is a collection of oral histories gathered through interviews with people {{who grew up in the}} rural vicinity of the Williams farmstead, and also in East Austin; their recollections pertain to Travis and Hays Counties mainly during the first half of the twentieth century. The memories are primarily those of African Americans who are descendants of slaves—people whose lives were impacted by the legacy of slavery and who lived through the Jim Crow and <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>eras.</b> The story of how and why this book came into existence is important because it demonstrates the viability of community-based research in publicly funded cultural resources management archeological projects...|$|R
