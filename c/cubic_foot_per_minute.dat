50|$|Landfill gas can be {{converted}} to high-Btu gas by reducing its carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen content. The high-Btu gas can be piped into existing natural gas pipelines or in the form of CNG (compressed natural gas) or LNG (liquid natural gas). CNG and LNG can be used on site to power hauling trucks or equipment or sold commercially. Three commonly used methods to extract the carbon dioxide from the gas are membrane separation, molecular sieve, and amine scrubbing. Oxygen and nitrogen are controlled by the proper design and operation of the landfill since the primary cause for oxygen or nitrogen in the gas is intrusion from outside into the landfill because of a difference in pressure. The high-Btu processing equipment can be expected to cost $2,600 to $4,300 per standard <b>cubic</b> <b>foot</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (scfm) of landfill gas. Annual costs range from $875,000 to $3.5 million to operate, maintain and provide electricity to. Costs depend on quality of the end product gas as well as the size of the project. The first landfill gas to LNG facility in the United States was the Frank R. Bowerman Landfill in Orange County, California. The same process is used for the conversion to CNG, but on a smaller scale. The CNG project at Puente Hills Landfill in Los Angeles has realized $1.40 per gallon of gasoline equivalent with the flow rate of 250 scfm. Cost per gallon equivalent reduces as the flow rate of gas increases. LNG can be produced through the liquidfication of CNG. However, the oxygen content needs to be reduced to be under 0.5% to avoid explosion concerns, the carbon dioxide content must be as close to zero as possible to avoid freezing problems encountered in the production, and nitrogen must be reduced enough to achieve at least 96% methane. A $20 million facility is estimated to achieve $0.65/gallon for a plant producing 15,000 gallons/day of LNG (3,000 scfm). Estimates are in 2007 dollars.|$|E

40|$|This {{analysis}} was conducted to identify the energy cost savings from retrofitting Texas buildings with air-to-air ERV (Energy Recovery Ventilator) systems. This analysis applied ERV and psychrometric equations in a bin-type procedure to determine the energy and costs required to condition outside air to return-air conditions. This analysis does not consider interactions with the air-handling system; therefore the effects of economizers, reheat schemes, variable flow rates and other adaptive components were not considered. This analysis demonstrates that ERV cost-effectiveness is largely dependent upon the building location in Texas (i. e., climate conditions) and outside air fraction: ? For a typical laboratory building that requires 100 % outside air, an ERV could save roughly $ 1. 00 to $ 1. 50 per <b>cubic</b> <b>foot</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (CFM) of outside air during a one year period. ? For a typical office building that only requires 10 % outside air, an ERV could save up to $ 1. 00 per CFM of outside air over the period of one year...|$|E

40|$|The effort {{towards the}} {{development}} of an engine that is efficient and green {{has become one of the}} biggest efforts of the major part of the automotive industry. The contribution of air quality to the engine plays an important role to increase power while minimizing the exhaust emission. The main purpose of this article is to investigate the characteristic of the air intake system of a naturally aspirated engine on a steady flow bench. The experiment was conducted using an industrial flow bench apparatus where the pressure different test pressures can be set and, at every test pressure, the valve is lifted at an increment of 1 mm until the maximum possible valve lift where the flow rate is obtained in terms of <b>cubic</b> <b>foot</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> or CFM. The experiment process was then repeated at different configuration. The experimental result shows that the flow rate increases with each valve lift in a linear pattern until at a certain point where the value becomes constant. The result also indicated that the flow rate increases as the different pressure increases. ...|$|E

50|$|The term <b>cubic</b> <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (CFM) is {{ambiguous}} {{when it comes}} to the mass of gas that passes through a certain point because gas is compressible. If the pressure is doubled, then, for an ideal gas, the mass of the gas that passes by will also be double for the same rate of flow in <b>cubic</b> <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> For instance, a centrifugal fan is a constant CFM device or a constant volume device, meaning that, at a constant fan speed, a centrifugal fan will pump a constant volume of air rather than a constant mass.

25|$|<b>Cubic</b> <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (CFM) is {{an often}} {{confusing}} term {{because it has}} no single definition that applies to all instances.

To further confuse the issue, a centrifugal fan is a constant CFM device or a constant volume device. This means that, provided the fan speed remains constant, a centrifugal fan will pump a constant volume of air. This {{is not the same as}} pumping a constant mass of air. Again, the fan will pump the same volume, though not mass, at any other air density. This means that the air velocity in a system is the same even though mass flow rate through the fan is not.|$|R
