This layout meant the entire main battery could fire on the broadside, though fewer could fire end-on.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic programming approach for semi-automated road extraction from medium- and high-resolution images. This method is {{a modified version}} of a pre-existent dynamic programming method for road extraction from low-resolution images. The basic assumption of this pre-existent method is that roads manifest as lines in low-resolution images and as such can be modelled and extracted as linear features. Contrary to this, roads manifest as ribbon features in medium- and high-resolution images and the goal of road extraction methods becomes the road <b>centrelines.</b> As a result, the original method can not accurately extract road <b>centrelines</b> from medium- and high- resolution images. In view of this, we propose a modification of merit function of the original approach, which is carried out by a constraint function embedding road edge properties. Preliminary results demonstrate the modified algorithm’s potential in extracting road <b>centrelines</b> from medium- and high-resolution images. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} for simultaneous motion tracking of left ventricle and coronary arteries from cardiac Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) images. We first use the multi-scale vesselness filter proposed by Frangi et al. 1 to enhance vessels in the cardiac CTA images. The vessel <b>centrelines</b> are then extracted as the minimal cost path from the enhanced images. The <b>centrelines</b> at end-diastolic (ED) are used as prior input for the motion tracking. All other <b>centrelines</b> are {{used to evaluate the}} accuracy of the motion tracking. To segment the left ventricle automatically, we perform three levels of registration using a cardiac atlas obtained from MR images. The cardiac motion is derived from cardiac CTA sequences by using local-phase based non-rigid registration. The CTA image at each time frame is registered to the ED frame by maximising the proposed similarity function and following a serial propagation scheme. Once the images have been aligned, a dynamic motion model of the left ventricle can be obtained by applying the computed free-form deformations to the segmented left ventricle at ED phase. A similar propagation method also applies to the coronary arteries. To validate the accuracy of the motion model we compare the actual position of the coronaries and left ventricle in each time frame with the predicted ones as estimated from the proposed tracking method...|$|R

40|$|The {{recovery}} of three-dimensional (3 D) object information from biplane CT angiographic images {{is still a}} challenge in application of modelling coronary vessel trees. The proposed method of 3 D reconstruction is obtained from the two-dimensional (2 D) corresponding feature points by using triangulation projection based on the rotated mechanical angles of the CT angiographic machine. Those 2 D feature points are on the <b>centrelines</b> of vessels. This research also includes how to extract the interested coronary vessels from CT angiographic images and how to represent those vessels {{as a group of}} connected 2 D points that are on <b>centrelines</b> of them. One of the contributions in the paper is that we developed automatic searching algorithm to obtain the 2 D corresponding points from a pair of biplane skeleton images under the two constraints of epipolar lines and corresponding bifurcations. We apply the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm to register the corresponding bifurcations from an image sequence for the application of the proposed searching algorithm. The 3 D reconstruction applies the readings of rotated mechanical angles and isocentre of the CT angiographic machine (Siemens Axiom) to establish the biplane image relationships of rotation and translation, and then projects the 2 D <b>centrelines</b> of coronary vessels onto 3 D world coordinates. Another contribution of the paper is that we apply the back projection algorithm to project the 3 D points onto 2 D image planes for evaluating the accuracy of the 3 D reconstruction. The proposed method has been tested on patient data. Key Words: 3 D reconstruction, biplane angiographic image, coronary vessel. ...|$|R

The scale-space technique was able to discriminate between the vasculatures of the three different tumour types prior to treatment. Results also suggested that over-expression of Ang- 2 was associated with susceptibility of the tumour vasculature to the vascular disrupting agent, combretastatin A 4 phosphate (CA 4 P).

40|$|Abstract — Tubular structures, such as vasculatures, {{pulmonary}} airways, nervous {{systems and}} bile ducts, {{are common in}} medical images. The anatomical studies and the corresponding disease diagnosis require well-coordinated efforts of image segmentation, topological descriptions, and geometrical quantization. Accurate measurements of the structural information can be conducive to performing any synergistic surgical planning, percutaneous access, or catheter-based interventions. Many automatic algorithms and procedures exist for extraction, analysis, and visualization for tubular structures in three-dimensional (3 -D) images. Little work has been on effective cross-sectional analysis, which is essential for valid medical and clinical examinations of those structures. In this paper, we propose an approach that employs a unidirectional and parallelizable region growing method that is efficient and robust to create cross sections (CS) perpendicular to the <b>centrelines</b> of the tubular structures. The method is independent of how the <b>centrelines</b> are generated, either by skeletonization or by the other medial-line tracking schemes. We addressed computationally separable, unidirectional, and parallelizable properties of the proposed approach. The experimental results of 3 -D CT images show the proposed approach is less computationintensive and requests less processing memory than that of traditional methods, and is especially useful for large-scale and complex tubular structures...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on extracting the {{structure}} of vessels from 3 D cardiac images. In many biomedical applications {{it is important to}} segment the vessels preserving their anatomically-correct topological structure. That is, the final result should form a tree. There are many technical challenges when solving this image analysis problem: noise, outliers, partial volume. In particular, standard segmentation methods are known to have problems with extracting thin structures and with enforcing topological constraints. All these issues explain why vessel segmentation remains an unsolved problem despite years of research. Our new efforts combine recent advances in optimization-based methods for image analysis with the state-or-the-art vessel filtering techniques. We apply multiple vessel enhancement filters to the raw 3 D data {{in order to reduce the}} rings artifacts as well as the noise. After that, we tested two different methods for extracting the structure of vessels <b>centrelines.</b> First, we use data thinning technique which is inspired by Canny edge detector. Second, we apply recent optimization-based line fitting algorithm to represent the structure of the <b>centrelines</b> as a piecewise smooth collection of line intervals.

40|$|While common digital {{road network}} graphs {{are able to}} {{represent}} real-world street network topology relations quite adequately, they are highly generalized {{with regard to the}} composition of a road. Irrespective of their actual number of lanes, roads are shown as just one single line. As many intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications require or provide lane-specific data and services, this is no longer sufficient from a short- to medium-term perspective. In particular, automated driving requires high-accuracy graphs both in topology and in geometry to localize positions not only on the correct road, but also in the correct lane. In the following paper, a cost-effective methodology for deriving such lane-level road network graphs will be described. The methodology is applied to standard GNSS trajectories collected for three different road types (urban, interurban, motorway) by vehicles participating in real-world traffic situations (Floating Car Data). The methodology extracts the number and position of lane <b>centrelines</b> from pre-processed GNSS trajectories using a kernel density estimation (KDE) and distance relations.
