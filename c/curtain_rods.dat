5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic <b>curtain</b> <b>rods.</b> He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E
500|$|The same episode {{reveals that}} by the early 1960s he was an US Army Captain {{involved}} in black ops and intelligence, and that he served alongside Fox Mulder's father, Bill. The Smoking Man was already involved in the arming of anti-Castro rebels in Cuba and the assassinations of Patrice Lumumba and Rafael Trujillo before he was enlisted by a secret cabal to assassinate President John Fitzgerald Kennedy in Dallas. The assassination was motivated by Kennedy's mishandling of the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the subsequent Cuban Missile Crisis. As part of the mission, the Smoking Man told the designated patsy, Lee Harvey Oswald, to bring the <b>curtain</b> <b>rods</b> {{as a way to}} frame him for the murder. Incidentally, it was Oswald himself who introduced the Smoking Man to cigarettes. By 1968, the Smoking Man had progressed enough in the hierarchy to push himself for the assassination of Martin Luther King, concerned that King was [...] "talking like a Maoist" [...] and a threat to the American war effort in Vietnam. He did the deed himself because he had [...] "too much respect for the man," [...] and chose to frame a white racist because of his own sympathy for black civil rights.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the days}} before Kennedy's arrival, several local {{newspapers}} described {{the route of the}} presidential motorcade, which passed the Texas School Book Depository. On November 21 (a Thursday) Oswald asked Frazier for an unusual mid-week lift back to Irving, saying he had to pick up some <b>curtain</b> <b>rods.</b> The next morning (the day of the assassination), he returned to Dallas with Frazier. He left behind $170 and his wedding ring, but took a large paper bag with him. Frazier reported that Oswald told him the bag contained <b>curtain</b> <b>rods,</b> The Warren Commission concluded that the package of [...] "curtain rods" [...] actually contained the rifle that Oswald was going to use for the assassination.|$|E

2500|$|Japanese bombings, {{destruction}} by retreating American troops, deprivations by bandit [...] "guerrilla" [...] bands, and hoarding by civilians {{had significantly}} reduced available war supplies, {{as well as}} those items necessary to run an effective government. Fertig used his engineering skills and the skills of other escaped Americans and resisting Filipinos to create many supplies from scratch. For example, tuba was brewed from coconut palms to provide alcohol to fuel gasoline vehicles, batteries were recharged by soaking them in tuba, soda bottles and fence wire were used to create a telegraph to enhance communications, <b>curtain</b> <b>rods</b> were cut into pieces and shaped to provide ammunition for [...]30 caliber rifles, steel was shaved from automobile springs and curled to make recoiling springs for rifles, money was printed in both English and the local language using wooden blocks, and fisherman towed Japanese mines ashore to secure the explosive amatol so it could be used to make gunpowder. Soap was made from coconut oil and wood ashes. Then the soap was traded for sugar which was then used to make alcohol for fuel.|$|E
2500|$|Oswald was interrogated {{several times}} during his two days at Dallas Police Headquarters. He {{admitted}} {{that he went to}} his rooming house after leaving the book depository. He also admitted that he changed his clothes and armed himself with a [...]38 revolver before leaving his house to go to the theater. However, Oswald denied killing Kennedy and Tippit, denied owning a rifle, and said two photographs of him holding a rifle and a pistol were fakes. He denied telling his co-worker he wanted a ride to Irving to get <b>curtain</b> <b>rods</b> for his apartment (he said that the package contained his lunch). He also denied carrying a long, bulky package to work the morning of the assassination. Oswald denied knowing an [...] "A. J. Hidell". Oswald was then shown a forged Selective Service System card bearing his photograph and the alias, [...] "Alek James Hidell" [...] that he had in his possession {{at the time of his}} arrest. Oswald refused to answer any questions concerning the card, saying [...] "you have the card yourself and you know as much about it as I do." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{his sense}} {{returned}} to him {{he found himself}} lying in the curtained corner of a big room. At least {{he thought it was}} big because of the vast expanse of ceiling which he could see above the <b>curtain</b> <b>rods</b> and the sounds without, some of which seemed to come from a distance. There was a window, too, through which he caught sight of lawns and statues and formal trees. Just then the curtain was drawn, and there appeared a middle-aged woman dressed in white, looking very calm, very kind and very spotless, who started a little when she saw that his eyes were open and that his face was intelligent.|$|E
50|$|The curtain {{dress was}} {{conceptualized}} and designed by The Carol Burnett Show costumer Bob Mackie. The script originally {{called for the}} dress to be hanging off of Burnett, but Mackie did not find it funny. He asked the art director for a real <b>curtain</b> <b>rod</b> and green fabric and made the dress on a mannequin. Burnett said that she came into costume fittings and {{when she saw the}} <b>curtain</b> <b>rod</b> she said it was the most brilliant sight gag ever.|$|R
50|$|The entire outfit, with <b>curtain</b> <b>rod,</b> is {{on display}} at the Smithsonian Institution. In {{addition}} to this, Mattel released a character doll of Burnett as Starlet under the Barbie Celebrity Doll line in 2009.|$|R
50|$|Hanging the <b>curtain</b> <b>rod</b> {{higher or}} lower, or {{especially}} {{further away from}} the shower head, can reduce the effect. A (convex) curved shower rod {{can also be used}} to hold the curtain against the inside wall of a tub.|$|R
60|$|The {{room had}} been his study for four-and-twenty years. It had been {{furnished}} at his marriage, and all the essential equipment dated from then, the large complex writing-desk, the rotating chair, the easy chair at the fire, the rotating bookcase, the fixture of indexed pigeon-holes that filled the further recess. The vivid Turkey carpet, the later Victorian rugs and curtains had mellowed now to a rich dignity of effect, and copper and brass shone warm about the open fire. Electric lights had replaced the lamp of former days; that was the chief alteration in the original equipment. But among these things his connection with the Food had left abundant traces. Along one wall, above the dado, ran a crowded array of black-framed photographs and photogravures, showing his son and Cossar's sons and others of the Boom-children at various ages and amidst various surroundings. Even young Caddles' vacant visage had its place in that collection. In the corner stood a sheaf of the tassels of gigantic meadow grass from Cheasing Eyebright, and on the desk there lay three empty poppy heads as big as hats. The <b>curtain</b> <b>rods</b> were grass stems. And the tremendous skull of the great hog of Oakham hung, a portentous ivory overmantel, with a Chinese jar in either eye socket, snout down above the fire....|$|E
50|$|<b>Curtain</b> <b>rods</b> {{can be made}} of many {{materials}} including- wood, {{metal and}} plastic. <b>Curtain</b> <b>rods</b> come in almost endless styles and designs. Not all <b>curtain</b> <b>rods</b> are simple straight poles; curved and hinged poles are available from numerous companies, allowing installation in bay windows and around curved walls and corners. <b>Curtain</b> <b>rods</b> can also be shaped like a crane or exhibit a swing arm design. Prices and quality of <b>curtain</b> <b>rods</b> are as varied as designs from inexpensive big box store products to high end specialty products made by companies catering to interior designers and architects.|$|E
50|$|A curtain rod, curtain rail, or {{traverse}} rod is {{a device}} used to suspend curtains, usually above windows or {{along the edges}} of showers, though also wherever curtains might be used.

50|$|Closets - The contestants, {{using their}} stud walls {{from the first}} day to build their closet. Jo will be {{assisting}} Charmaine for this challenge, as Tiina is feeling ill, and with the expert's help, she finishes admirably (with no nails involved in the construction). While Casey uses medium-density fiberboard for their closet exterior (cutting the floor while doing so), everyone else uses lightweight veneer. Dez's overwhelelming reliance on brackets leads him to mismeasure and fail, while Joe's closet was too wide to accommodate his <b>curtain</b> <b>rod.</b> Casey's closet also fails for making his closet too narrow (though Marnie manages to build a <b>curtain</b> <b>rod</b> from dowelling and plumbing parts). Tex, despite cursing a lot, manages to pass the challenge, making a closet that could fit nearly all of the other contestants and nominators inside.|$|R

50|$|A weight can be {{attached}} to a long string and the string attached to the <b>curtain</b> <b>rod</b> {{in the middle of}} the curtain (on the inside). Hanging the weight low against the curtain just above the rim of the shower pan or tub makes it an effective billowing deterrent without allowing the weight to hit the pan or tub and damage it.|$|R
50|$|In the experts' results, Joe admits defeat (his <b>curtain</b> <b>rod</b> being a {{piece of}} wood that Geoff easily rips out), while Dez also admits failure (save the lights). Tex's {{criticism}} largely comes from his curtain, though he receives praise for his large closet (complete with wooden shutters and his portrait covering his wall safe inside), while Charmaine also receives praise for her closet curtains matching well with her expert-assisted closet.|$|R
5000|$|A pelmet (also {{called a}} [...] "cornice board") is a {{framework}} placed above a window, used to conceal curtain fixtures. These {{can be used}} decoratively (to hide the <b>curtain</b> <b>rod)</b> and help insulate the window by preventing convection currents. It is similar in appearance to a valance, which performs the same function but is made of fabric. A pelmet can be made of plywood, and may be painted, or fabric covered.|$|R

50|$|<b>Curtain</b> <b>rod</b> finials {{can be seen}} to act {{much like}} a {{barometer}} of public taste. Many designs hark back to the gothic and Neogothic of architectural finials, while other contemporary finials reflect minimalist, art nouveau and other traditional styles of décor. The use of different materials is as wide as the range of designs with brass, stainless steel, various woods and aluminium being employed with a variety of finishes such as ‘satin steel’ and 'antique brass'. The durability, strength and machinability of modern alloys have lent themselves to increasingly intricate and dazzling designs.|$|R

50|$|Bed posts {{often end}} in finials. Wooden posts {{tend to have}} turned wood finials. While the purpose of finials on bed posts is mostly decorative, they serve a purpose on <b>curtain</b> <b>rods,</b> {{providing}} {{a way to keep}} a curtain from slipping off the end of a straight rod.|$|E
