5|$|Bootlegs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>counterfeit</b> or unlicensed recordings, which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product as close as possible. Some record companies have considered that any record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a <b>counterfeit,</b> which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen to stress that the markets for bootleg and <b>counterfeit</b> recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{worked at}} Mohawk Valley Bank for six years. During {{this time he}} {{developed}} an interest in <b>counterfeit</b> money. He collected <b>counterfeit</b> bills and assembled a scrapbook of these for study. He then had another book of genuine bills; he then compared the two to learn the counterfeiters' techniques. He became an expert in detecting <b>counterfeit</b> bills. This became a valued interest to the bankers and Myers was given all the bank notes to pass through him for approval of genuineness. This ultimately became {{a basis for the}} present day method of detecting <b>counterfeit</b> bills.|$|E
5|$|Sophisticated counterfeits {{have been}} found in several Asian {{countries}} such as Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, and are an important cause of avoidable death in those countries.

40|$|A simple matching-model {{of money}} with the {{potential}} for <b>counterfeiting</b> is constructed. In contrast to the existing literature, <b>counterfeiting,</b> if it occurred, would be accompanied by two distortions: costly production of <b>counterfeits</b> and harmful effects on trade. However, application of the Cho-Kreps refinement is shown to imply that there is no equilibrium with <b>counterfeiting.</b> If the cost of producing <b>counterfeits</b> is low enough, then there is no monetary equilibrium. Otherwise, there is a monetary equilibrium without <b>counterfeiting.</b> <b>Counterfeits</b> and <b>counterfeiting...</b>|$|R

Main determinants of demand for <b>counterfeits</b> are experience with <b>counterfeits,</b> satisfaction with them, price of <b>counterfeits</b> and current income.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the differences between}} Chinese and Western consumers on attitude toward <b>counterfeits.</b> Results show that these two ethnic groups are different {{on most of the}} components of attitude toward <b>counterfeits.</b> In particular, they rated differently on social cost of <b>counterfeiting,</b> social benefit of reproduction, and anti-big-business mentality. However, these two groups have no significant difference on ethical belief. This does not affect attitude toward <b>counterfeits</b> and ethnic groups in predicting the purchase of <b>counterfeits.</b> Thus, the following conclusions are drawn from this study: (a) Chinese and Western consumers are different in attitude toward counterfeits; (b) a higher number of sampled Chinese consumers have purchased <b>counterfeits</b> before; and (c) purchasing <b>counterfeits</b> is explained by ethnic groups, social benefit of reproduction, and ethical belief.

5|$|In October 1984, {{a warrant}} was issued for McLaughlin's arrest after {{he failed to}} appear in court on {{previous}} charges. McLaughlin was arrested in for illegally trafficking <b>counterfeit</b> shoes and money laundering in 1990. According The New Yorker, McLaughlin, who had ties in Mexico from when he played baseball there, made deals with Korean businesspeople to make <b>counterfeit</b> footwear. The brands that he counterfeited included Converse, Vans, and Adidas, which he manufactured to sell in the Mexican market. Harley Lewin, a lawyer who pursued people in the <b>counterfeit</b> business, found that McLaughlin was making 80,000 pairs of sneakers for about $750,000 any given month. Lewin also discovered that half of all <b>counterfeit</b> footwear in Mexico could be traced back to McLaughlin's business. McLaughlin pleaded guilty to the money laundering charges, but fled the county before being sentenced.

40|$|<b>Counterfeiting</b> poses a {{significant}} public policy issue {{because of the}} important role that paper money plays in Canada's payments system.

An appropriate pubic policy response is thus necessary to maintain the public's continued confidence in the national currency. To assess the threat from <b>counterfeiting,</b> including possible loss of confidence in the currency, estimating the stock of <b>counterfeits</b> circulating is necessary. In this article, Chant proposes a composite method of detecting <b>counterfeits</b> as an effective alternative to existing methods and offers estimates of the extent of <b>counterfeiting</b> Canadian currency for 2001.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{show that a}} lax anti-counterfeiting policy is {{inconsistent}} with price stability. I use a deterministic matching model with no commitment and no enforcement. An intrinsically worthless but perfectly durable object called a ‘note’ can be produced by banks at a given cost, but also by nonbanks at a (possibly) higher cost. <b>Counterfeiting</b> occurs when nonbanks produce notes in equilibrium. When it is cheap for nonbanks to produce notes, or the technology used to detect <b>counterfeits</b> is poor, <b>counterfeits</b> are circulating in equilibrium and trade is only implemented with a growing stock of notes (thus creating inflation). Finally, I show that the highest welfare level is achieved when <b>counterfeiting</b> is costly, or when the detection of <b>counterfeits</b> is of high quality.

40|$|Adoption of productivity- and income-enhancing {{agricultural}} technologies is conspicuously low in Africa {{south of}} the Sahara. Farmers’ beliefs regarding the authenticity of agricultural inputs are important for explaining technology adoption: if farmers {{do not believe that}} inputs are genuine, they are unlikely to invest in them. The degree of alignment between beliefs about and actual <b>counterfeiting</b> can help explain both the social costs of the “lemons” problem, and low rates of adoption. This is the first paper to explore whether farmer beliefs regarding <b>counterfeiting</b> align with actual rates of <b>counterfeiting,</b> and we do so across a very large geographic area serving tens of thousands of farmers in Uganda using a more precise measure of <b>counterfeiting</b> than many previous studies. We examine the relationship between beliefs and <b>counterfeiting</b> using quantitative measures of farmer beliefs regarding the authenticity of herbicide in their local market as well as a large random sample of laboratory-tested herbicide samples to measure <b>counterfeiting</b> rates in local markets. We report evidence of considerable <b>counterfeiting</b> of herbicides in local markets, with nearly one in three bottles containing less than 75 percent of the labeled concentration of active ingredient. We find evidence that farmers’ beliefs regarding the extent of <b>counterfeiting</b> of herbicide are significantly associated with measures of the actual prevalence of <b>counterfeiting</b> in local markets. These results indicate that farmers are at least partly informed about the “market for lemons” problem in local input markets. However, the results also suggest that although better informed farmers imply a lower social cost of <b>counterfeiting,</b> the high rate of <b>counterfeiting</b> and the relative accuracy of farmer information contributes to low adoption of agricultural inputs in Africa.
