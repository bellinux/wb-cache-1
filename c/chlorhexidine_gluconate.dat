40|$|<b>Chlorhexidine</b> (CHX) <b>gluconate,</b> {{a bitter}} bis-biguanide antiseptic, reduces the {{intensity}} of the salty taste of NaCl and bitter taste of quinine in humans. This study addresses regional specificity of CHX’s effects on taste. Perceptual intensity and quality were measured for separate taste bud containing oral loci innervated either by afferent fibers of cranial nerve (CN) VII or CN IX. Measurements were obtained following three 1 -min oral rinses with either 1. 34 mM CHX or water, the control rinse. CHX rinse reduced {{the intensity of}} NaCl more at the tongue tip and palate than at posterior oral sites. Thus, fungiform and palatal salt-taste receptors may differ from salt-taste receptors of the foliate and circumvallate taste papillae. The intensity of quinineHCl was reduced equally by CHX at all sites tested but was frequently tasteless on the less sensitive anterior sites, suggesting quinine receptor diversity. In rodents, a portion of NaCl-taste receptors in the receptive field of CN VII is sensitive to the epithelial Na+ channel blocker amiloride and a portion is amiloride insensitive; all CN IX receptors are amiloride insensitive. The current results are the first to suggest that there may also be distinct, regionally specific populations of NaCl-taste receptors in humans.

40|$|Background: The risk to dentists, dental assistants, and {{patients}} {{of infectious diseases}} through aerosols has long been recognized. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of commercially available preprocedural mouthrinses containing 0. 2 % <b>chlorhexidine</b> (CHX) <b>gluconate,</b> chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) mouthwash, and water in reducing the levels of viable bacteria in aerosols. Materials and Methods: This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-group parallel-designed study was conducted over a period of 4 months. One hundred twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were divided randomly into three groups (A, B, and C) of 40 patients each to receive the ClO 2 mouthwash, water, and 0. 2 % CHX gluconate respectively as preprocedural rinse. The aerosol produced by the ultrasonic unit was collected at five standardized locations with respect to the reference point, i. e., the mouth of the patient. The blood agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, and the total number of colony-forming units (CFUs) was counted and statistically analyzed. Results: The results showed that CFUs in groups A and C were significantly reduced compared to group B, and P 0. 05). The numbers of CFUs were the highest at the patient′s chest area and lowest at the patient′s front i. e., the 6 o′clock position.

40|$|Evaluating {{sanitization}} of toothbrushes using {{ultra violet}} rays and 0. 2 % chlorhexidine solution: A comparative clinical study Background: Toothbrushes {{may play a}} significant role in plaque control. Toothbrushes should be correctly stored, disinfected and changed at regular intervals. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 0. 2 % <b>chlorhexidine</b> (CHX) <b>gluconate</b> solution and ultra violet (UV) toothbrush-sanitizer for toothbrush disinfection. Materials and Methods: Fresh tooth brushes were distributed to fifteen study subjects, who were selected randomly and who met the study criteria. All the study participants were asked to brush their teeth with the tooth brush provided. No special instructions were given regarding the brushing techniques. Toothbrushes were collected after 7 days. All tooth brushes were randomly allocated to three groups. Tooth brushes were subjected to microbial analysis and total bacterial count was assessed. Tooth brushes allocated to Group I were soaked in 2 % CHX mouthwash for 12 h, Group II were kept in UV‑light toothbrush holder for 7 min, and Group III were soaked in normal saline for 12 h. All the toothbrushes were subjected for microbial analysis and mean bacterial count was determined. Results: There was a statistically significant difference between mean colony‑forming unit count pre‑sanitization and post‑sanitization in all the groups, using 0. 2 % CHX gluconate, UV rays and normal saline (P < 0. 007). However, the mean bacterial count reduced drastically after the treatment with UV rays (P = 0. 001). Conclusions: CHX, UV rays and normal saline are effective in a reduction of bacterial count on toothbrushes. UV rays treatment was more effective, when compared to CHX and normal saline.

Methods: Forty-eight healthy subjects participated in a double-blind, randomized, parallel experiment and were randomly allocated {{to any one of}} the three experimental mouthrinses: group A (0. 2 % <b>chlorhexidine</b> (CHX) <b>gluconate),</b> group B (0. 03 % triclosan + 0. 025 % sodium fluoride (NaF) + 12 % ethyl alcohol) or group C (0. 2 % CHX + 0. 3 % triclosan + 0. 3 % NaF + 0. 09 % Zn chloride (ZnCl 2). All the subjects were assessed for gingivitis, plaque, supragingival calculus and extrinsic stains at baseline {{and at the end of}} the 21 -day experimental period. Results: There was a significant difference (P = 0. 046) in the effectiveness for the prevention of gingivitis and plaque, with subjects of group A and group C presenting least and highest gingival and plaque scores, respectively. Significant differences (P = 0. 03) were observed for the accumulation of supragingival calculus where the deposition of calculus in group A was nearly double that of the group B, and group B was most effective in the prevention of supragingival calculus. Highest deposition of extrinsic stains was in the group A followed by group C and group B. There was no significant difference between the three treatments for adverse events’ occurrence. Conclusions: CHX mouthrinse was most effective in controlling plaque and gingivitis but caused greatest deposition of extrinsic stains.

40|$|The {{microbial}} contamination rate of luers of central venous catheters (CVCs) with either PosiFlow® needleless connectors or standard caps attached was investigated.

Seventy-seven patients undergoing cardiac surgery who required a CVC {{as part of}} their clinical management were randomly allocated either needleless connectors or standard caps. Patients were also designated to receive chlorhexidine/alcohol, isopropyl alcohol or povidone-iodine for pre-CVC insertion skin preparation and disinfection of the connections. After 72 h in situ the {{microbial contamination}} rate of 580 luers, 306 with standard caps and 274 with needleless connectors attached, was determined. The microbial contamination rate of the external compression seals of 274 needleless connectors was also assessed to compare the efficacy of the three disinfectants. The internal surfaces of 55 out of 306 (18 %) luers with standard caps were contaminated with micro-organisms, whilst only 18 out of 274 (6. 6 %) luers with needleless connectors were contaminated (P< 0. 0001). Of those needleless connectors disinfected with isopropyl alcohol, 69. 2 % were externally contaminated with micro-organisms compared with 30. 8 % disinfected with chlorhexidine/alcohol (P< 0. 0001) and 41. 6 % with povidone-iodine (P< 0. 0001). These results suggest that the use of needleless connectors may reduce the microbial contamination rate of CVC luers compared with the standard cap. Furthermore, disinfection of needleless connectors with either chlorhexidine/alcohol or povidone-iodine significantly reduced external microbial contamination. Both these strategies may reduce the risk of catheter-related infections acquired via the intraluminal route. © 2003 The Hospital Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.
