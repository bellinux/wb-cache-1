25|$|After this distraction, England lost 2 quick wickets {{to end the}} day of 113/3. They {{recovered}} on day 3 {{through the}} efforts of Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen who both scored centuries. England were eventually bowled out for 446, and their bowlers made an improved effort in Pakistan's second innings, reducing them to 183/6 by the end of day 4. They <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> a possible victory, but Inzamam-ul-Haq was still at the wicket going into day 5.|$|E

500|$|Diggs {{later wrote}} to Jeri Taylor, {{requesting}} a character be named after Samantha Wildman, {{a young girl}} whose kidney donation saved his wife's life. [...] Taylor wrote {{in the character of}} Samantha Wildman, who recurred as the department head of xenobiology because her namesake had been a fervent animal lover. [...] Diggs described his motivation for lobbying for the name: I couldn't imagine the selflessness of people who, {{in the middle of their}} grief over the loss of their child, <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> someone else, could save someone else's life.' [...] Jimmy says that in ancient times, the gods would immortalize heroes by placing them in the stars. 'Samantha Wildman will live on,' he says. 'She's taken her [...] in the stars.|$|E

"Now {{that that}} show is just humming and doing amazing {{business}} — it’s the #1 bestselling magic {{show in the}} world as far as ticket sales and the perception that people are experiencing and coming back to see it multiple times — I felt it was in a great place and I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> television again. Obviously, “Believe” will continue to evolve until its last performance because I always want to add new magic, I’m always tweaking and transforming it. I missed being on television, I had something new creatively to say, and Spike became the perfect home to do it." [...] Endemol purchased the foreign distribution rights for the show, and was the [...] "most-watched new original series [...] in more than 18 months" [...] according to The Hollywood Reporter.|$|E
500|$|He {{signed a}} new one-year deal with Vale in July 2011, after Micky Adams {{returned}} to the club as manager. After scoring five goals in his first nine games he admitted that [...] "He [...] is the only manager that can control me so I think he gets {{the best out of}} me." [...] However, on 19 September he was given a fourteen-day suspension by the club for 'a serious breach of club discipline', after he missed a day of training without any warning and then 'reported in unfit to carry out his duties' the following day; Adams said [...] "I'm bitterly disappointed in him." [...] He was also placed on the transfer list, as Adams stated [...] "he's got a lot to do" [...] before Roberts <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> a return to the first team.

500|$|The {{majority}} of the episode—like the rest of seasons six, seven, eight and nine—was filmed {{in and around the}} Los Angeles, California area. Before shooting the episode, Chris Carter reminded Patrick various times that he had to be in [...] "good shape". On the audio commentary, Patrick remembers being [...] "nervous" [...] for the shooting of the episode, since he was a big fan of The X-Files before becoming a part of the acting crew. The scene in which Walter Skinner tells Doggett that he himself witnessed Mulder being taken away aboard a UFO was filmed {{in the second part of}} Patrick's first night of production on the series; this scene also marked the first time that Patrick got to work with Pileggi. The ending of the episode, as well as a {{majority of}} its follow-up [...] "Without" [...] were filmed at Split Mountain in Anza-Borrego State Park. According to producer Paul Rabwin, an [...] "incredible heat wave" [...] hit the area during the shooting, resulting in terrible filming conditions. In the desert, the cast and crew were informed that there was a [...] "one in twenty-five" [...] chance that someone would be bit by a rattlesnake. Pileggi later joked that during the filming of his scenes all he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> was stumbling upon a snake.|$|E

500|$|A comment he {{made during}} the debate became another {{campaign}} issue for Thompson. He again apologized for remarks, this time over an {{answer to a question}} in which he stated that he believed the decision to fire a gay worker based on the morals of the employer is something that should be [...] "left up to the individual business." [...] A few days following the debate, the candidate rescinded the comments, and blamed the gaffe on a malfunctioning hearing aid, stating that he [...] "didn't hear the question." [...] Thompson also said that he was sick during the debate, having been hospitalized three days earlier with the flu and bronchitis, and that all he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> [...] "was getting off the stage." [...] Campaign adviser Steve Grubbs would later point to this episode as the moment Thompson's campaign became [...] "unrecoverable." [...] Thompson was harshly criticized for the remarks. Jason Stephany, the political director of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, rhetorically asked [...] "How many times is he going to say something that's completely offensive to the majority of Americans before people start to say, 'What's going on here?'" [...] Thompson tried to reassure the public that there was [...] "nothing discriminatory about [...] at all." [...] Afterwards, he finished second in a poll of state convention members from Wisconsin, with 84 of the 306 members polled, trailing Fred Thompson who received 95 votes. He stood at 16% in an average of statewide polls for the state in May, and stood at 4.3% in Iowa, where he based his campaign.|$|E

[...] "There {{are a lot of things}} that we <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> and wonder how we could use them creatively", Crowle said. [...] " [...] give the controller a character, so you feel like a little bit of the world is in your hands." [...] The DualShock 4 was emphasized in part because Media Molecule enjoy implementing innovative concepts into their games, but also so that the [...] "personality" [...] of the device could be brought out in ways that could influence games in the future.|$|E
500|$|She {{followed}} her same [...] "writing ritual" [...] {{that she had}} followed for years and used in writing all of her books and poetry: she rented a hotel room, closeted herself there from the early morning to the afternoon, and wrote on legal pads. After deciding upon the theme [...] "America", she wrote down everything she <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of <b>about</b> the country, which she then [...] "pushed and squeezed into a poetic form".

60|$|All Danny Meadow Mouse <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> was {{his short}} tail.

To Johnson he seemed little better than a monster. His thoughts were bitter as he sped back to his shop.|$|E

60|$|The {{end of it}} {{was that}} it went against us. Faith's marriage, her identity, and Hester's, were proved beyond all doubt, and little Alured was served Earl of Trevorsham. Poor child, how ill he was just then! It was {{declared}} water on the brain! I <b>could</b> hardly <b>think</b> <b>about</b> anything else; but they all said it seemed like a mockery, and that he would not bear the title a week. And then Lady Hester would have been, not Countess of Trevorsham, but Viscountess Torwood, and at any rate she halved the personal property: all that had been meant for us.|$|R

Only on Tuesdays do I let myself play ping-pong at a club.” [...] At the age of 20, Vidal was diagnosed with cancer.

That was all Dicky <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> at first--would he be well enough to go with Mr. Bentley by Saturday? And he was forever asking me to tell Mr. Bentley he was sick. I saw the old gentleman on the street to-day, and I almost went up to him. But I hadn't the courage." ...|$|E
60|$|Betty {{started her}} typewriter, but her {{thoughts}} were not fixed {{on what she}} wrote. She pondered about Wolf and was vaguely disturbed. Kit had laughed at Olivia's warning, but sometimes Kit was confident and rash. After all, it was possible Miss Brown was justified. Then Betty glanced at a letter she took from the machine and tore the sheet across. Jefferson was not fastidious, but he liked his customers {{to know what he}} meant. She <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> Wolf and Kit again, and in the meantime must concentrate on her proper duty.

[...] "There {{will be plenty of}} time for sentiment, dear mother, when Laura comes back," [...] he said, and he looked in the glass with a killing air, and his mother put his hair off his forehead and kissed him, and of course thought, for her part, that no woman could resist him: and was exceedingly happy that day.|$|E

60|$|To begin with, {{he thought}} he had not {{neglected}} his duties. It looked as if Don Ramon at the office approved him, and if they got the sheep on board, Wolf ought to be satisfied. Mossamedes carried a paying cargo, and Kit had kept the cost of shipment low. He was making good, and now he had been given some responsibility, found he could, without much effort, carry his load. In a sense, however, this was not important; he really meant to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> Olivia. Olivia had carried him away and after a half-hearted struggle he had let himself go. She had beauty, pluck, and a cultivation higher than his. Sometimes she was gracious, and when they jarred he thought she found the jars amusing. She laughed at him afterwards and he did not mind. He would sooner she laughed than let him alone. He <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>about</b> her without a disturbing thrill.|$|R
50|$|At the 1996 {{parliamentary}} election LSCG entered a coalition {{agreement with the}} People's Party (NS) called Popular Unity.

The coalition of liberals and populists won 24.91% of votes and gained 19 MPs, 9 of which belonged to LSCG.
