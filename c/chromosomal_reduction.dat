All are cyclically parthenogenetic, meaning that they seasonally alternate between female parthenogenetic generations in which unfertilized diploid oocytes develop into females, and a sexual generation in which oocytes must be fertilized by sperm obtained from males. Asexual females, which occur typically in the spring and summer, maintain diploidy with-out sperm via a modified meiosis that, in effect, skips <b>chromosomal</b> <b>reduction</b> (reviewed in [1]). In all but the most basal groups of aphids, asexual females are also vi-viparous, their progeny completing embryogenesis within the ovaries prior to birth (Figure 1 B). Sexual females are produced in the fall by asexual mothers that are exposed to shortened day lengths. Their ovaries contain oocytes * Correspondence...|$|E
40|$|The {{angiosperm}} family Brassicaceae contains {{both the}} research model Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and the agricultural genus Brassica. Comparative genomics in the Brassicaceae has largely focused on direct comparisons between Arabidopsis and the species of interest. However, the reduced genome size and chromosome number (n = 5) of Arabidopsis complicates comparisons. Arabidopsis shows extensive genome and chromosome reshuffling compared to its close relatives Arabidopsis lyrata and Capsella rubella, both with n = 8. To facilitate comparative genomics across the Brassicaceae we recently outlined {{a system of}} 24 conserved chromosomal blocks based on their positions in an ancestral karyotype of n = 8, rather than by their position in Arabidopsis. In this report we use this system {{as a tool to}} understand genome structure and evolution in Boechera stricta (n = 7). B. stricta is a diploid, sexual, and highly self-fertilizing species occurring in mostly montane regions of western North America. We have created an F 2 genetic map of B. stricta based on 192 individuals scored at 196 microsatellite and candidate gene loci. Single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping of 94 of the loci was done simultaneously using an Illumina bead array. The total map length is 725. 8 cM, with an average marker spacing of 3. 9 cM. There are no gaps greater than 19. 3 cM. The <b>chromosomal</b> <b>reduction</b> from n = 8 to n = 7 and other genomic changes in B. stricta likely involved a pericentric inversion, a chromosomal fusion, and two reciprocal translocations that are easily visualized using the genomic blocks. Our genetic map will facilitate the analysis of ecologically relevant quantitative variation in Boechera...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} {{that lead to}} the differentiation of male germ cells from their spermatogonial stem cells through meiosis to give rise to mature haploid spermatozoa has been a major quest for many decades. Unlike most other cell types this differentiation process is more or less completely dependent upon the cells being located within the strongly structured niche provided by mature Sertoli cells within an intact seminiferous epithelium. While much new information is currently being obtained through the application and description of relevant gene mutations, there is still a considerable need for in vitro models with which to explore {{the mechanisms}} involved. Not only are systems of in vitro spermatogenesis important for understanding the basic science, they have marked pragmatic value in offering ex vivo systems for the artificial maturation of immature germ cells from male infertility patients, as well as providing opportunities for the transgenic manipulation of male germ cells. In this review, we have summarized literature relating to simplistic © 2012 Landes Bioscience. culturing of germ cells, co-cultures of germ cells with other cell types, especially with Sertoli cells, cultures of seminiferous tubule fragments, and briefly mention the opportunities of xenografting larger testicular pieces. The majority of methods are successful in allowing the differentiation of small steps in the progress of spermatogonia to spermatozoa; few tolerate the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>reduction</b> division through meiosis, and Do not distribute. even fewer seem able to complete the complex morphogenesis which results in freely swimming spermatozoa. However, recent progress with complex culture environments, such as 3 -d matrices, suggest that possibly success is now not too far away...|$|E
40|$|Many {{orthopaedic}} implants {{are composed of}} alloys containing chromium. Of particular relevance is {{the increasing number of}} Cobalt Chromium bearing arthroplasies being inserted into young patients with osteoarthritis. Such implants will release chromium ions. These patients will be exposed to the released chromium for over 50 years in some cases. The subsequent chromium ion metabolism and redistribution in fluid and tissue compartments is complex. In addition, the potential biological effects of chromium are also controversial, including DNA and <b>chromosomal</b> damage, <b>reduction</b> in CD 8 lymphocyte levels and possible hypersensitivity reactions (ALVAL). The establishment of these issues and the measurement of chromium in biological fluids {{is the subject of this}} review...|$|R
40|$|SummaryTelomere length {{homeostasis}} {{is essential}} for genomic stability and unlimited self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We show that telomere-associated protein Rif 1 is required to maintain telomere length homeostasis by negatively regulating Zscan 4 expression, a critical factor for telomere elongation by recombination. Depletion of Rif 1 results in terminal hyperrecombination, telomere length heterogeneity, and <b>chromosomal</b> fusions. <b>Reduction</b> of Zscan 4 by shRNA significantly rescues telomere recombination defects of Rif 1 -depleted ESCs and associated embryonic lethality. Further, Rif 1 negatively modulates Zscan 4 expression by maintaining H 3 K 9 me 3 levels at subtelomeric regions. Mechanistically, Rif 1 interacts and stabilizes H 3 K 9 methylation complex. Thus, Rif 1 regulates telomere length homeostasis of ESCs by mediating heterochromatic silencing...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{replication}} licensing {{occurs on}} chromatin, but how the chromatin template is regulated for replication remains mostly unclear. Here, we have analyzed {{the requirement of}} histone methyltransferases for {{a specific type of}} replication: the DNA re-replication induced by the downregulation of either Geminin, an inhibitor of replication licensing protein CDT 1, or the CRL 4 CDT 2 ubiquitin E 3 ligase. We found that siRNA-mediated reduction of essential components of the MLL-WDR 5 -RBBP 5 methyltransferase complexes including WDR 5 or RBBP 5, which transfer methyl groups to histone H 3 at K 4 (H 3 K 4), suppressed DNA re-replication and <b>chromosomal</b> polyploidy. <b>Reduction</b> of WDR 5 /RBBP 5 also prevented the activation of H 2 AX checkpoint caused by re-replication, but not by ultraviolet or X-ray irradiation; and the components of MLL complexes co-localized with the origin recognition complex (ORC) and MCM 2 - 7 replicative helicase complexes at replication origins to control the levels of methylated H 3 K 4. Downregulation of WDR 5 or RBBP 5 reduced the methylated H 3 K 4 and suppressed the recruitment of MCM 2 - 7 complexes onto replication origins. Our studies indicate that the MLL complexes and H 3 K 4 methylation are required for DNA replication but not for DNA damage repair...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} genes have been {{associated}} with variation in human spermatogenesis related to fertility. One of these, the Deleted in Azoospermia (DAZ) gene, exists as copies on two chromosomes, 3 and Y. The autosomal copy, DAZ-like (DAZL), has one RNA recognition motif (RRM) and is homologous to the DAZL gene found throughout the vertebrate lineage. There are four copies of DAZ on the Y chromosome with a pair at each of two sites. One pair contains a single RRM and the other has three RRMs. Human DAZ is homologous to genes in old world primates and ape Y chromosomes. Both DAZ and DAZL bind messenger RNAs at U-rich sequences near the poly-A tail in a manner that facilitates translation. Both are expressed in spermatogonia during the transition from mitotic cellular expansion through meiotic <b>chromosomal</b> <b>reduction</b> and during spermiogenesis. This study examined genomic variation in DAZ and DAZL, including deletion of DAZ from individuals with various levels of sperm cell production and mutations of DAZL in male partners of infertile couples. Deletions in DAZ are not as common in azoospermic men from central Texas as compared to other reports. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in anonymous infertility patients, but were not located in the exons of the RRM. Proteins produced from transcripts encoded by genes from human DAZL, DAZL with SNPs within and outside the RRM, and a DAZ with single RRM were identified. Binding activity of DAZL to mRNA was confirmed using a microarray method, and mRNA from human testes was screened to identify at least 1, 313 mRNA potential targets for DAZL. These targets were involved in ribosome construction, pyruvate metabolism, cell cycle control, and proteasome function. Variations in binding of protein to a high and a low bound target mRNA were demonstrated between protein constructs of DAZL, DAZL with mutations, and DAZ. Binding of DAZL to mRNA was also confirmed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. With materials and procedures developed during this study, comparisons of genetic variants of DAZ and DAZL can be performed to identify mechanisms responsible for structural and functional differences in control of spermatogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Leachates from {{solid wastes}} have {{been implicated in}} the {{pollution}} of the environment including surface and groundwater contamination which ultimately affect human health. Raw leachates were obtained from three open dumpsites: a University campus (CSL), an urban market place (UML), and a domestic dumpsite (OSL), and were evaluated for their possible genotoxic effects on the root tip cells of Allium cepa L. The leachates were examined {{for the presence of}} heavy metals using standard methods. The onion bulbs were cultivated in 1 %, 2. 5 %, 5 % and 20 % of each leachate sample, and after 48 hours, one root tip from each bulb was harvested and processed for cytological observation using the aceto-orcein squash technique. After 72 hours, mean root lengths of the Allium cepa were obtained. The results revealed that compared to the control, treatment with the leachates resulted in significant (p< 0. 05) concentration-dependent onion root growth inhibition with EC 50 values of 3. 2 %, 4. 5 %, and 5. 7 % for CSL, UML and OSL respectively. The leachates were characterized by various <b>chromosomal</b> aberrations and <b>reduction</b> in the number of dividing cells. The physical and chemical properties showed that the leachates were acidic and contained toxic chemicals. CSL was most toxic, while OSL was least toxic. The results obtained suggest that the toxic chemicals present in these leachates pose a threat to the environment and human health if left unchecked...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasma pulmonis is {{a natural}} rodent pathogen, {{considered}} a privileged model for studying respiratory mycoplasmosis. The complete genome of this bacterium, which belongs to the class Mollicutes, has recently been sequenced, but studying the role of specific genes requires improved genetic tools. In silico comparative analysis of sequenced mollicute genomes indicated the lack of conservation of gene order in the region containing the predicted origin of replication (oriC) and the existence, {{in most of the}} mollicute genomes examined, of putative DnaA boxes lying upstream and downstream from the dnaA gene. The predicted M. pulmonis oriC region was shown to be functional after cloning it into an artificial plasmid and after transformation of the mycoplasma, which was obtained with a frequency of 3 × 10 − 6 transformants/CFU/μg of plasmid DNA. However, after a few in vitro passages, this plasmid integrated into the <b>chromosomal</b> oriC region. <b>Reduction</b> of this oriC region by subcloning experiments to the region either upstream or downstream from dnaA resulted in plasmids that failed to replicate in M. pulmonis, except when these two intergenic regions were cloned with the tetM determinant as a spacer in between them. An internal fragment of the M. pulmonis hemolysin A gene (hlyA) was cloned into this oriC plasmid, and the resulting construct was used to transform M. pulmonis. Targeted integration of this genetic element into the chromosomal hlyA by a single crossing over, which results in the disruption of the gene, could be documented. These mycoplasmal oriC plasmids may therefore become valuable tools for investigating the roles of specific genes, including those potentially implicated in pathogenesis...|$|R
