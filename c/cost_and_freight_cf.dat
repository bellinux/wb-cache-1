However, achieving an improved rail <b>freight</b> transport service <b>and</b> an increased market share in a competitive environment is rather complex in several aspects as freight trains would need to operate with principles and characteristics resembling those of passenger’s traffic {{in order to attract}} new type of goods. In order to adopt the principles and characteristics used in passenger trains, airlines and hotel industries into intermodal line train systems, a simulation model has been developed and implemented. The principles for pricing which we have considered are base on the available train capacity along a travel sub-leg and our objective was to increase the performance of the intermodal line cargo train system. We adopted the yield management concept with rail freight customers given the possibility to change their start and/or end train stations (travel sub-leg) and/or to change their departure day in an intermodal line cargo train system. Using our developed simulation tool, we have examined the performance of an intermodal line cargo train system with respect to the dynamic and constant pricing strategy. Our prime objective was to investigate and answer the questions which pricing strategy leads to the best space utilization and performance of an intermodal line train cargo system? Our simulation results show that the dynamic pricing gives the best space utilization <b>and</b> rail <b>freight</b> performance. Dynamic pricing strategy appears good to both the train operators, in term of the revenue generated, <b>and</b> the <b>freight</b> transporters as they achieved reduced transport <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>freights</b> accommodation at train stations different from their closest train stations.

30|$|During the {{dictatorship}} the government purchased wheat at artificially high prices; however, as the aforementioned interviewees expounded, {{a more open}} economy exposed Brazilian producers to foreign competition, and high prices were thus no longer guaranteed. The government’s official policy of self-sufficiency in wheat ended in 1990, leading to increases in imports. At that time, the <b>cost,</b> insurance, <b>and</b> <b>freight</b> (CIF) of importing wheat were low. The high global stock of wheat and the American government’s subsidization of wheat exports were largely responsible for low global prices, and increased the appeal of foreign wheat to Brazilian purchasers. In spite of the sharp drop in prices brought by liberalization, Brazilian prices remained high in comparison to international prices, and millers consequently increased consumption of foreign wheat (Brum & Müller 2008).|$|R

30|$|The final {{analysis}} relates to a dynamic model for real gasoline {{prices in the}} USA from 1993 to 2012. This approach {{is based on an}} error correction model where the adjustment coefficients switch between regimes. Disequilibrium is captured by the correction, but this may be unstable or relate to a further equilibrium. Estimation of the Markov Switching ECM indicates that deviations from long-run equilibrium have an effect on gasoline price dynamics. Also the result signifies that regular gasoline <b>costs</b> (insurance <b>and</b> <b>freight),</b> gas retail real price, residual fuel oil price, and distillate fuel oil price significantly affect the relative real gasoline price in the market. More specifically it demonstrates that there are two different regimes of Supply and Demand in the US gasoline market indicating that the market collusion may be less concern of this market in the USA.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{the globe}} is {{suffering}} {{an economic downturn}} and the competition within the logistics industry has {{become more and more}} intense. Therefore, a number of logistics services providers (LSPs), such as freight forwarding companies, is facing with a decline in business volume. It is believed that the reason of profit loss is due to high operating <b>and</b> transportation <b>costs</b> within the logistics network. LSPs, in such sense, try to reappraise the current logistics network and relocate the distribution centres for cutting operating costs, reducing lead time, and enhancing customer service level. In order to help these companies achieve these goals, a decision support system (DSS) is required to analyze various factors including inbound <b>freight</b> <b>costs,</b> warehousing <b>costs,</b> <b>and</b> outbound <b>freight</b> <b>costs</b> under different scenarios. In this paper, a logistics costs analyzer (LCA) is proposed to reduce <b>freight</b> <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> shorten delivery time by selecting appropriate suppliers and constructing effective distribution routes.

40|$|This paper studies two {{important}} variants {{of the dynamic}} economic lot-sizing problem that are applicable {{to a wide range}} of real-world situations. In the first model, production in each time period is restricted to a multiple of a constant batch size, where backlogging is allowed <b>and</b> all <b>cost</b> parameters are time varying. Several properties of the optimal solution are discussed. Based on these properties, an efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed. The efficiency of the dynamic program is further improved through the use of Monge matrices. Using the results developed for the first model, an O(n 3 log n) algorithm is developed to solve the second model, which has a general form of product acquisition cost structure, including a fixed charge for each acquisition, a variable unit production <b>cost,</b> <b>and</b> a <b>freight</b> <b>cost</b> with a truckload discount.

40|$|Following the Hatfield {{accident}} in October 2000, {{the cost of}} running Britain’s railways has increased very sharply, leading to considerable debate about whether current cost levels are reasonable. This paper seeks to inform this debate by assessing post-Hatfield <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> TFP levels (2000 / 01 to 2001 / 02) against the historical precedents set by British Rail and the early experience of the newly-privatised industry (1963 to 1999 / 00). The results show that industry cash costs rose by 47 % between 1999 / 00, the last financial year before Hatfield, and 2001 / 02 - but, surprisingly, with train operating <b>costs</b> (TOCs <b>and</b> <b>freight</b> operators) accounting for 42 % of this growth. The results also show that the post-Hatfield cost spike is unprecedented when compared against historical benchmarks, indicating that recent cost rises cannot simply {{be explained by the}} investment cycle or so-called “bow-wave” effects. Furthermore, according to the preferred models, post-Hatfield productivity levels are lower than at any time over the last four decades. Analysis of long-term data on quality and safety measures indicates that an excessive focus on rail safety may offer part of the explanation for the recent cost growth, with the emphasis on safety also resulting in less attention to punctuality and reliability...|$|R
30|$|Company C is a {{manufacturer}} of steel powder products. It turns over 750  M€ per annum, employs around 1700 workers, and has sales and distribution representation in 75 countries. Most of the production is located in Sweden from Swedish iron ore, {{but there are also}} production facilities in the USA and India. Company C recognizes that its global competitive advantage is product quality and advanced research and development. Flows included in the case study are outbound flows of components (i.e., general steel powder) and finished products (i.e., customer-specific prepared mixes of steel powders). The company purchases container liner shipping services directly, without the involvement of a forwarder, using Incoterm CIF (<b>Cost</b> Insurance <b>and</b> <b>Freight)</b> when delivering to its customers. The company has a standing order based on the departure schedule of the relevant shipping lines. Deviation from the standing order is managed through contacts with the shipping line. Air freight is an option only during rare occasions of emergency. Usually, different shipping lines are called on in order to manage variation in demand and disturbances. Transport service suppliers are re-evaluated annually using competitive tenders. The annual volume for the relevant flows is about 10, 000 TEUs.|$|R
50|$|This term is broadly {{similar to}} the above CFR term, with the {{exception}} that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit to the named port of destination. CIF requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of their value under at least the minimum cover of the Institute Cargo Clauses of the Institute of London Underwriters (which would be Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses. The policy {{should be in the}} same currency as the contract. The seller must also turn over documents necessary, to obtain the goods from the carrier or to assert claim against an insurer to the buyer. The documents include (as a minimum) the invoice, the insurance policy, and the bill of lading. These three documents represent the <b>cost,</b> insurance, <b>and</b> <b>freight</b> of CIF. The seller's obligation ends when the documents are handed over to the buyer. Then, the buyer has to pay at the agreed price. Another point to consider is that CIF should only be used for non-containerized seafreight; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CIP.|$|R
