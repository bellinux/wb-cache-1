5|$|In 2011, at the {{direction}} of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator David Feeney, the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal opened an inquiry into thirteen cases of unresolved recognition for past acts of gallantry. Among the group were eleven naval personnel, including Sheean. Known as the 'Valour Inquiry', the Tribunal was directed to determine if the individuals were unduly overlooked for recognition {{at the time of their}} actions and, if so, whether retrospective awards were appropriate. The inquiry lasted two years and witnessed 166 written submissions from the public, before the Tribunal reported its findings in January 2013. In the case of Sheean, the Tribunal found that there was no manifest injustice with the award of the Mention in Despatches, and that there was no new evidence to support the reconsideration of Sheean for a Victoria Cross for Australia. If Sheean had lived, they reported, he might have been recommended for either the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal or the Distinguished Service Medal instead, but neither medal could be awarded posthumously in 1942. The Tribunal did recommend that the RAN perpetuate the use of Sheean as the name of a major <b>combatant</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|E

DMS's contract to provide in-service support will be terminated in 2017, and the patrol boats are undergoing a major refit in Singapore to reinforce the hull.

50|$|The Offshore <b>Combatant</b> <b>Vessel</b> (OCV) is a {{proposed}} multipurpose small warship class for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Initially {{proposed in the}} 2009 Defence White Paper and marked as procurement project SEA 1180, the 20 OCVs would replace 26 vessels across four separate ship classes: the s, the s, the s, and the es. Although having a common design (which could be up to 2,000 tonnes in displacement), the ships would use a modular mission payload system to fulfil specific roles; primarily border patrol, mine warfare, and hydrographic survey. The 2013 Defence White Paper committed to the OCV project as a long-term goal, but opted {{in the short term}} for an accelerated procurement of an existing design to replace the Armidales, and life-extension refits for the other types.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{the idea}} of bulbous bow has been {{extended}} from the commercial ships {{to the design of}} an integrated bow that houses a sonar dome for naval ships. In the present study, a design method for a particular set of requirements consisting of a narrow range of input parameters is presented. The method uses an approximate linear theory with sheltering effect for resistance estimation and pressure distribution, and correlation with statistical analysis from the existing literature and the tank-test results available in the public domain. Though the optimisation of design parameters has been done for the design speed, but the resistance performance over the entire speed range has been incorporated in the design. The bulb behaviour has been discussed using the principle of minimisation of resistance and analysis of flow pattern over the bulb and near the sonar dome. It also explores the possible benefits arising out of new design from the production, acoustic, and hydrodynamic point of view. The results of this study are presented in the form of design parameters (for the bulbous bow) related to the main hull parameters for a set of input data in a narrow range. Finally, the method has been used to design the bulbous bow for a surface <b>combatant</b> <b>vessel...</b>|$|E

Under the tactical direction of former Chief of Naval Staff Admiral (retired) Shahid Karimullah, Pakistan Navy ships immediately rendered their assistance to Government of Maldives for evacuation of stranded tourists/locals from islands. Pakistan Navy continued this humanitarian assistance through rendering diplomatic and material support by sending two more ships with sizeable relief efforts to Indonesia and Sri Lanka.
