40|$|The {{increasing}} {{attention given}} to resource sharing as a concept is not matched by practical progress; shortage of funds makes it more desirable but less practicable, whether libraries try to share their own resources or share a central facility. Many of the obstacles to sharing, such as limited local resources and the inability to handle much external demand, are intrinsic and cannot be solved by technology, but it can nevertheless alleviate some of the procedural hindrances, such as union list construction, maintenance and access and the transmission and switching of requests. The application of electronic technology to document transmission is at present uneconomic and desirable only in <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>urgency.</b> The availability <b>of</b> original texts in electronic form may change this situation but only slowly and not for all documents. The private sector may play an increasing role, and libraries may have less involvement {{not only in the}} supply of documents to other libraries but in access to documents for their users...|$|R

Analysing, systemising and generalising scientific works of many economists, the article describes ways of solution {{of the problem of}} organisation of works on planning and introducing the accounting function at industrial enterprises and in production associations – individual planning, increase of a number of organisations that plan functionally developed accounting subsystem and training of relevant specialists. In the result of the study the article realises an important direction of development in improvement of organisation of accounting and economic and analytical support at industrial enterprises and in production associations based on uniformity of project decisions on the subsystem of the accounting and analytical support and functional development of the process of its creation. The issue of organisation of the calculation process while planning and introducing the accounting function in functionally developed management systems <b>of</b> <b>special</b> purpose <b>of</b> industrial enterprises and production associations is <b>of</b> <b>special</b> <b>urgency</b> among the prospects of further studies in this direction. Further development of accounting can result in replacement of traditional accounting with functionally developed subsystem of accounting and analytical support with intensive use of the concept of methodologically justified paradigmatic approach...|$|R
