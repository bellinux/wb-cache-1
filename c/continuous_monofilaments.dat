40|$|Reported are 204 primary {{external}} ureteroneocystostomies and 16 primary ureteroureterostomies in {{a series}} of 220 consecutive renal transplants. A total of 12 (5 %) complications occurred; however, only seven (3 %) required major operative repair, whereas five (2 %) were minor and were repaired by cystoscopic or transvesical procedures. There was no mortality and no allograft loss from these complications, which tend to occur late and be amenable to prompt repair. Since the complications of external ureteroneocystostomy differ from those of the internal ureteroneocystostomy, a discussion of their treatment is provided. A review of literature shows that the external repair is growing in popularity because of its good results. The good results are attributable to the use of a short length of ureter, to the use of a <b>continuous</b> <b>monofilament</b> suture that produces an anastomosis less likely to leak, and to the need of a very small cystostomy...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the incidence of}} wound failure (burst abdomen and incisional herniation up to 4 years after operation) in a consecutive series of 282 major laparotomies closed with <b>continuous</b> <b>monofilament</b> nylon, and randomly allocated to mass (all layers except skin) or layered (anterior and posterior aponeuroses separately sutured) techniques. Surgeons were free to choose the site and direction of incision {{which resulted in a}} preponderance of midline incisions in the mass, and of paramedian incisions in the layered, group. One patient in the former, and two in the latter, burst their abdomens during early convalescence, and 17 incisional hernias were discovered within four years in the mass group compared with four in the layered group (log rank X 2 7. 16, P less than 0. 01). Seven hernias in the former, and one in the latter, group were not detected within eight months of operation. We conclude that layered closure of a paramedian incision results in a lower incidence of incisional hernias than mass closure of a midline incision and that many hernias are not discovered until years after operation...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundWound {{dehiscence}} and incisional hernia {{are potentially}} serious complications following abdominal surgery, especially if performed through a midline incision. Although prophylactic reinforcement with on-lay mesh {{has been shown}} to reduce this risk, a permanent mesh carries the risk of seroma formation, infection and persistent pain. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the safety of a resorbable on-lay mesh to reinforce the midline suturein patients with high risk for wound dehiscence or incisional hernia. MethodSixteen patients with three or more risk factors for wound dehiscence or incisional hernia were included. A TIGR® Matrix mesh, composed of a mixture of 40 % copolymer fibres of polyglycolide, polylactide, and polytrimethylene carbonate and 60 % copolymer fibres of polylactide, and polytrimethylene carbonate, was placed on the aponeurosis with an overlap of 5 on either side, and fixated with <b>continuous</b> <b>monofilament</b> polydioxanone suture. All postoperative complications were registered at clinical follow-up. ResultsMean follow-up was nine months. One patient developed a seroma that needed drainage and antibiotic treatment. One patient had a wound infection that needed antibiotic treatment. There was no complication requiring a reoperation. No wound dehiscence or incisional hernia was seen. ConclusionOn-lay placement of TIGR® Matrix is safe, and may provide a feasible way of reinforcing the suture line in patients with high risk for postoperative wound dehiscence or incisional hernia. Larger samples are required, however, if one is to draw any conclusion regarding the safety and effectiveness of this technique,...|$|R
5000|$|Cherney {{incision}} - Cherney {{described a}} transverse incision that allows excellent surgical {{exposure to the}} space of Retzius and the pelvic sidewall. The curvilinear skin and rectus fascial incision is made 2 finger breadths above the symphysis pubis and carried in Langer's lines from 2 fingerbreadths medial to one anterior superior iliac spine to the corresponding position medial to the opposite anterior superior iliac spine. The anterior rectus fascia is mobilized distally off the underlying rectus muscle bodies. The pyramidalis muscles are dissected free and sharply excised to expose the underlying rectus tendons. With an index finger, a plane is developed between the fibrous tendons of the rectus muscle and the underlying transversalis fascia. Using a sharp no.10 scalpel blade, the rectus tendons are transected transversely 1-2 cm distal to the superior edge of the pubic bone. Rectus muscle should never be cut. The rectus muscles are retracted and the peritoneum opened.The inferior epigastric vessels may need division. Closure is accomplished with 5 to 6 horizontal mattress sutures of permanent braided suture approximating the anterior rectus tendons to the intact distal anterior rectus fascia. <b>Continuous</b> <b>monofilament</b> suture closure of lateral edges of the rectus muscle to the anterior rectus fascia prevents hernia. Patients should wear a binder for at least 2 weeks. No incision provides wider pelvic exposure, and is relatively painless compared to midline incisions. Result is the most pleasing cosmetic result of any abdominal incision.|$|R
40|$|Background Permanent {{pacemaker}} implantation after surgical aortic valve replacement depends on patient selection and {{risk factors for}} conduction disorders. We aimed to identify risk criteria and obtain a selected group comparable to patients assigned to transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Methods Isolated sutured aortic valve replacements in 994 patients treated from 2007 to 2015 were reviewed. Demographics, hospital stay, preexisting conduction disorders, surgical technique, and etiology in patients with and without permanent {{pacemaker implantation}} were compared. Reported outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation were {{compared with those of}} a subgroup including only degenerative valve disease and first redo. Results The incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation was 2. 9 %. Longer hospital stay (p[*]=[*] 0. 01), preexisting rhythm disorders (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), complex prosthetic endocarditis (p[*]=[*] 0. 01), and complex redo (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) were associated with permanent pacemaker implantation. Although prostheses were sutured with <b>continuous</b> <b>monofilament</b> in the majority of cases (86 %), interrupted pledgetted sutures were used more often in the pacemaker group (p[*]=[*] 0. 002). In the subgroup analysis, the incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation was 2 %; preexisting rhythm disorders and the suture technique were still major risk factors. Conclusion Permanent pacemaker implantation depends on etiology, preexisting rhythm disorders, and suture technique, and the 2 % incidence compares favorably with the reported 5 - to 10 -fold higher incidence after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Cost analysis should take this into account. Often dismissed as minor complication, permanent pacemaker implantation increases the risks of endocarditis, impaired myocardial recovery, and higher mortality if associated with prosthesis regurgitation...|$|R

40|$|We {{carried out}} a prospective, {{randomized}} study over a 1 -year period to compare the efficacy of a single layer of <b>continuous</b> absorbable <b>monofilament</b> (Maxon) {{with that of a}} single layer of interrupted Polyglactin sutures (Vicryl) in the performance of cervical esophagogastric anastomoses. Forty-two consecutive patients with carcinoma of the esophagus or cardia, in whom the stomach was transposed through the mediastinal route after esophagectomy, were enrolled in the study. There were 21 patients in each group. There was no hospital mortality. One asymptomatic anastomotic leak and two early anastomotic strictures requiring dilation occurred in patients in whom an interrupted technique was employed. The continuous technique required significantly less operative time (p < 0. 0001), and the cost of the suture material was reduced markedly. We conclude that either a continuous or an interrupted monolayer esophagogastric anastomosis can give satisfactory results after esophagectomy for cancer, provided that the vascular supply to the gastric fundus is maintained adequately. The continuous technique has the advantages of being time-saving, cheaper, and easier to perform and to teach...|$|R
40|$|Structural ceramic {{composites}} comprising continuous fibrillar microstructure {{are produced}} using sol-based technology which involves the extrusion, at room temperature, of a two-phase material (Al 2 O 3 /ZrO 2) {{resulting in an}} aligned bi-phase structure which is then multiple co-extruded to reduce the lateral dimensions of the phases. Two sol-derived pastes of differing chemistry (gamma-AlOOH as alumina source and zirconia) are co-extruded in parallel, and layed-up in closed-packed linear array to form a heterogeneous macro-plug for subsequent extrusion with or without zirconia coating. The second and third extrusion steps produce a filament with markedly reduced lateral paste dimensions provided that the flow properties of the chemically different pastes are similar. The resulting extrudates {{in the form of}} <b>continuous</b> green <b>monofilaments,</b> are subsequently laid up in a mould where the structure is pressed and consolidated in desired shape, then pressureless sintered in air to form the multi-phase component. The developed process allows the microstructure to be controlled at a nanometer scale within each extruded filament and after the 3 rd stage coextrusion, each filament size within the final extrudate is reduced to similar to 65 mum.

40|$|A {{total of}} 611 {{patients}} with {{carcinoma of the}} oesophagus or gastric cardia were operated on between July 1982 and December 1989. Resection was performed in 491 patients (one-stage, 483; two-stage, eight), bypass operation in 97, and 23 had exploration alone. The anastomoses of 580 patients with one-stage resection and bypass operations were evaluated. Hand-sewn anastomosis using a single layer of <b>continuous</b> absorbable <b>monofilament</b> suture was performed in 304 patients (221 resections and 83 bypasses). A stapled anastomosis was performed on 276 patients (262 resections and 14 bypasses). Following resection, there were 11 (5 per cent) anastomotic leaks in the hand-sewn group and ten (3. 8 per cent) in the stapled anastomosis group (P = 0. 69). Excluding anastomotic leaks, hospital mortality and anastomotic recurrence, stricture occurred in 18 of 172 hand-sewn anastomoses (10. 5 per cent) and in 57 of 195 stapled anastomoses (29. 2 per cent) (P < 0. 001). In patients who had bypass operations there were 12 anastomotic leaks, ten in the hand-sewn group (12. 0 per cent) and two in the stapled anastomosis group (14. 3 per cent). Only two of the discharged patients with bypass developed anastomotic strictures, a low incidence probably because of short survival. In addition, there were 245 subsidiary anastomoses made in the abdomen by the hand-sewn method {{as part of the}} reconstructive procedure, and there was one leak. The results of this non-randomized study suggest that hand-sewn anastomosis using a single layer continuous technique for the oesophagus is as safe as the use of circular staplers; hand-sewn anastomosis is less likely to become stenotic. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|We {{reviewed}} the operative results of 785 one-stage resections for {{carcinoma of the}} oesophagus and cardia, {{out of a total}} of 1, 264 patients with this tumour managed over a 12 -year period (62 %). Resection was considered curative in 321 patients (41 %), and was palliative in 464 patients (59 %). Seventy percent of patients had operative Stage III disease, while 5 % had Stage IV disease. The two most frequently performed procedures were the transthoracic Lewis-Tanner operation (49 %), and the transhiatal oesophagectomy (14 %). Our results showed comparable operative morbidity, mortality and survival between the two resection groups, with the exception of a higher risk of recurrent nerve injury after the transhiatal operation (18 % versus 9 %). The results were based on selection criteria favouring patients with increased pulmonary risks for the transhiatal approach, while patients with advanced middle-third tumour were selected for the transthoracic approach. The overall leakage rate was 4 %, and was the same for anastomosis made by the hand-sewn method, using a single layer <b>continuous</b> absorbable <b>monofilament</b> suture, and anastomosis made with circular stapler. The leakage rate was the same irrespective of whether the anastomosis was made in the neck or in the chest. However, stapled anastomosis has the disadvantage of a higher risk of fibrotic stricture formation. The 30 -day and hospital mortality for the 785 patients was 5 % and 14 %, respectively. An improvement in the hospital mortality was observed over the 12 -year period, with a 16 % incidence for the first six years, and 11 % for the subsequent six years (P = 0. 03). The five-year survival after curative and palliative resection was 35 % and 6 %, respectively, and was 18 % overall...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{work of this}} PhD thesis was done on the study, production and characterization of two types of metal matrix composites: 1) fiber reinforced metal matrix composites and, 2) carbon nanomaterials reinforced metal matrix composites. In fiber reinforced metal matrix composites, a metal or an alloy is reinforced with continuous or discontinuous fibers {{in order to improve}} the specific strength and stiffness at high temperatures. For example superalloys are the typical materials for the hot parts of aeronautic engines. They are very important in the aerospace field as they offer high temperature mechanical strength together with a good resistance to oxidation and corrosion. But due to high temperatures involved in the service conditions, buckling of the material may occur. In order to avoid this high temperature buckling phenomena, a reinforcement of the superalloy could be needed to maintain the mechanical properties. For this reason it was thought to investigate the possibility of realizing continuous fibers reinforced metal matrix composites over the superalloys that can further improve the high temperature properties. Due to its simplicity and viability, electrochemical deposition was chosen as the production technique to produce this kind of composite materials. The selected substrate for electrodepositing the nickel matrix composite was nickel based superalloy Inconel- 718, and <b>monofilament</b> <b>continuous</b> silicon carbide fibers were chosen as reinforcement. First of all chemical compatibility was studied between the nickel matrix, superalloy and silicon carbide fibers, both in the uncoated form, and coated with carbon or carbon/titanium diboride. Both theoretical calculations and experiments were conducted, suggesting the use of a carbon coating over fibers and a buffer layer of nickel to increase the interface quality as well as to avoid unwanted reactions between substrate and silicon carbide fibers. After studying the chemical feasibility of all the related components, electrodeposition of the composites was performed in order to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the process. Then final composites were deposited on the dog-bone shaped specimens of Inconel- 718. The produced composites were subjected to mechanical tests in order to evaluate the mechanical properties at room temperature and at high temperatures (400 °C and 600 °C). Evaluation of the results shows improvement in the yield strength of the produced composites with respect to the superalloy alone at room temperature. There is a decrease in the yield strength at high temperatures due to the failure of the interface between the superalloy and the composite layer but it is demonstrated that if a hot pressing treatment is done, then the interface strength is retained at high temperature and thus yield strength values will also increase. Fracture analysis and EDS analysis were also performed on the fractured surfaces of the samples with the help of field emission scanning electron microscope in order to study the fracture mechanisms involved and the composition of the interface after their testing at high temperatures. The fracture mechanisms in Ni/SiC composite layer was of debonding and pull out type which is typical characteristic of the fiber reinforced composites. The superalloy fractures with ductile behavior at room temperature. At temperatures of 400 °C and 600 °C, the superalloy fails with more ductile character after extensive amount of plastic deformation before its fracture. Carbon nanomaterials are widely being used to reinforce the metallic materials in order to improve their electrical, thermal, corrosion, wear and friction resistance for particular applications. In this part of the {{research work}}, graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and graphene oxide (GO) were chosen as nano reinforcements to produce nickel matrix nanocomposites with the intention to evaluate their wear and friction behavior.
