5|$|Geastrum welwitschii is morphologically {{similar to}} G.fornicatum in having fornicate, mostly 3–6 rays, of exoperidia and a <b>cup-shaped</b> mycelial layer. Geastrum welwitschii is {{distinguished}} from G.fornicatum by its epigeal mycelial cup with a felted or tufted outer surface.|$|E
5|$|Mycologist Dennis McCabe {{studied the}} {{development}} of the fruit body using specimens grown in pure culture. Starting out as a hyphal tuft, the fungus grows into a cup shape before eventually closing in completely to create the spherical structure of the mature fruit body. When the fungus is in the cup stage, the exposed hymenium is immature; typically, spores develop after the fruit body is fully closed. In some cases, the fruit body stops developing at the cup stage while the hymenium continues to mature. This results in a <b>cup-shaped</b> fungus with an exposed layer of basidia bearing normal and mature spores. Limnoperdon incarnatum is a structurally simple fungus, and relatively easy to grow in culture, suggesting it may have potential as a model organism for fruit body development in general. Under the experimental conditions used, fruit bodies matured to produce spores about 72 hours after the fungus started growing. The aborted cups resemble the sporocarps of the cyphelloid fungi, but can be distinguished by their orthotrophic spore attachment and the lack of ballistospory (forceful spore discharge). McCabe and Escobar later suggested that the fungus may have evolved the loss of ballistospory by being compensated with the <b>cup-shaped</b> fruit body closing at maturity. Halocyphina villosa is another small <b>cup-shaped</b> Basidiomycete fungus that has adapted to a marine environment; in contrast to L.incarnatum, however, it starts out with a closed fruit body that later opens up to become <b>cup-shaped.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pseudoplectania sphagnophila resembles P.nigrella, {{but has a}} {{more deeply}} and {{persistently}} <b>cup-shaped</b> fruit body, a short but distinct stem, and only grows amongst sphagnum moss. Plectania melastoma has elliptical to spindle-shaped spores measuring 20–28 by 8–12µm, while P.milleri has elliptical spores, and the margin of its cups have star-shaped points.|$|E
5|$|The apothecium—a {{specialized}} structure {{important in}} sexual reproduction in the ascomycetes—is a <b>cup-shaped</b> fruit {{body that is}} often macroscopic and holds the hymenium, a layer of tissue containing the spore-bearing cells. The fruit bodies of the basidiomycetes (basidiocarps) and some ascomycetes can sometimes grow very large, and many are well known as mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|The male of the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{which is}} found {{throughout most of}} Europe, is all black except for a yellow eye-ring and bill and has a rich, melodious song; the adult female and juvenile have mainly dark brown plumage. This species breeds in woods and gardens, building a neat, mud-lined, <b>cup-shaped</b> nest. It is omnivorous, eating {{a wide range of}} insects, earthworms, berries, and fruits.|$|E
5|$|Although a honeyeater, {{the striped}} honeyeater relies on insects as its major food source, and its bill has been adapted to an insect diet. When not {{breeding}} {{it has been}} recorded feeding and travelling in small groups, but it nests singly, laying around three eggs in a deep <b>cup-shaped</b> nest suspended {{from the end of}} drooping branches. It is widely distributed and common within its range, thus the population is listed as being of least concern for conservation by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Ascocoryne cylichnium, {{another small}} and {{gelatinous}} violet-colored species, has apothecia {{that are more}} often <b>cup-shaped,</b> and has larger spores—20–24 by 5.5–6µm. Because of its resemblance to the jelly fungi, A.sarcoides has been mistaken for the basidiomycete species Auricularia auricula and Tremella foliacea. T.foliacea is larger, brown, and leafy in appearance. Auricularia auricula is also larger, typically brown, is disc- or ear-shaped, with a ribbed undersurface. Microscopically, Tremella foliacea and Auricularia auricula are easily distinguished from A.sarcoides {{by the presence of}} basidia (rather than asci).|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of their diet {{is made up}} of plant material such as pollen, berries, nectar, from such species as grasstrees (Xanthorrhoea) and scarlet gum (Eucalyptus phoenicea), and cultivated crops such as bananas or particularly grapes. In general, birds prefer feeding at <b>cup-shaped</b> sources such as flowers of the Darwin woollybutt (Eucalyptus miniata), Darwin stringybark (E. tetrodonta) and long-fruited bloodwood (Corymbia polycarpa), followed by brush-shaped inflorescences, such as banksias or melaleucas, gullet-shaped inflorescences such as grevilleas, with others less often picked.|$|E
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} warbler, the Nauru {{reed warbler}} has dark brown upperparts, cream underparts and a long, thin beak. It makes a low, <b>cup-shaped</b> nest into which it lays {{two or three}} white eggs, and it feeds on insects. However, details about its behavior and ecology are little known. It is found throughout Nauru, which has changed substantially in recent decades due to phosphate mining. The Nauru reed warbler is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, and its small range means {{that it could be}} vulnerable to chance occurrences, such as tropical cyclones. Reports of a similar warbler from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere, but was driven to local extinction by introduced cats.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria {{by the absence}} of any red color in the cap, and the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may be confused with the blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a <b>cup-shaped</b> bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E
5|$|At , it {{is a small}} honeyeater with a short {{tail and}} {{relatively}} long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy, darting from flower to flower and gleaning insects off foliage. It calls constantly as it feeds. While little has been documented on the red-headed myzomela's breeding behaviour, it is recorded as building a small <b>cup-shaped</b> nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval, white eggs with small red blotches.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa, {{commonly}} known as the rubber cup, the rufous rubber cup, or the hairy rubber cup, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. The fungus produces <b>cup-shaped</b> fruit bodies that typically grow in clusters on branches and exposed portions of buried wood throughout eastern and Midwest North America and in Malaysia. The fruit bodies have the texture of tough, gelatinous rubber, and have a rough, blackish-brown, felt-like outer surface and a smooth reddish-brown inner surface. Although generally considered inedible by North American mushroom field guides, it is commonly consumed in Malaysia. The fungus produces several chemicals with a variety of bioactive properties.|$|E
5|$|Like other crustaceans, malacostracans {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} in which the heart pumps blood into the hemocoel (body cavity) where it {{supplies}} the needs of the organs for oxygen and nutrients before diffusing back to the heart. The typical respiratory pigment in malacostracans is haemocyanin. Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae, there are ganglia in each segment and a collection of major ganglia below the oesophagus. Sensory organs include compound eyes (often stalked), ocelli (simple eyes), statocysts and sensory bristles. The naupliar eye is a characteristic of the nauplius larva and consists of four <b>cup-shaped</b> ocelli facing in different directions and able to distinguish between light and darkness.|$|E
5|$|The {{saprobic}} fungus {{grows on}} decaying sticks and branches in damp spots on forest floors, generally buried under leaf litter {{or in the}} soil. The <b>cup-shaped</b> fruit bodies are usually produced during the cooler months of winter and early spring. The brilliant red interior of the cups—from which both the common and scientific names are derived—contrasts with the lighter-colored exterior. The edibility of the fruit bodies is not clearly established, but its small size, tough texture and insubstantial fruitings would dissuade most people from collecting for the table. The fungus has been used medicinally by the Oneida Indians, and also as a colorful component of table decorations in England. Molliardiomyces eucoccinea is the name given to the imperfect form of the fungus that lacks a sexually reproductive stage in its life cycle.|$|E
5|$|These sparrows feed {{primarily}} on {{seeds in the}} winter and insects in the spring and summer. The birds are often territorial, with males guarding their territory through song and displays. Flight is awkward for this species, which prefers to hop along the ground for locomotion. They are monogamous and breed during spring. Two to five eggs are laid in the bird's nest, which is <b>cup-shaped</b> and well hidden. Adult sparrows are preyed upon by house cats and small raptors, while young may be taken by a range of mammals and reptiles. They have been known to live for up to three years, two months. Although the species has been classified as least concern, or unthreatened with extinction, some subspecies are threatened by habitat destruction and one may be extinct.|$|E
5|$|This tit-tyrant defends its {{territory}} only against other tit-tyrants and, {{except for the}} southernmost population, is non-migratory. The tufted tit-tyrant feeds mainly {{on a variety of}} insects that it hunts on or from small shrubs, typically by perch gleaning. It normally hunts in pairs. The breeding season varies for this bird depending on its geographical location. Two to three eggs are normally laid twice a year in a <b>cup-shaped</b> nest made of root fibers, grasses, and lichens and lined with small feathers. The tufted tit-tyrant is listed as a species of least concern due to its large range and population.|$|E
5|$|Widespread across western, {{northern}} and eastern Australia, the brown honeyeater occupies {{a range of}} habitats from mangroves to eucalypt woodlands. It is seasonally nomadic within its local area, following flowering food plants. While it usually forages alone, it also feeds in small groups, or flocks of mixed honeyeater species. Nectar and insects form its diet. It occupies the same breeding territory each year, and lays two or three eggs in a <b>cup-shaped</b> nest woven from grass and soft bark. Both sexes contribute to nest building and feeding the young. It has a loud, clear, musical song, described as {{the best of all}} the honeyeaters.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, the pied butcherbird is {{generally}} sedentary. Common in woodlands and in urban environments, it is carnivorous, eating small vertebrates and insects. A tame and inquisitive bird, the pied butcherbird {{has been known}} to accept food from humans. It nests in trees, constructing a <b>cup-shaped</b> structure out of sticks and laying two to five eggs. The pied butcherbird engages in cooperative breeding, with a mated pair sometimes assisted by several helper birds. The troop is territorial, defending the nesting site from intruders. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pied butcherbird as being of least concern on account of its large range and apparently stable population.|$|E
5|$|Corals are sessile {{animals in}} the class Anthozoa and differ from most other cnidarians in not having a medusa stage in their life cycle. The body unit of the animal is a polyp. Most corals are colonial, the initial polyp budding to produce another and the colony {{gradually}} developing from this small start. In stony corals, also known as hard corals, the polyps produce a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate to strengthen and protect the organism. This is deposited by the polyps and by the coenosarc, the living tissue that connects them. The polyps sit in <b>cup-shaped</b> depressions in the skeleton known as corallites. Colonies of stony coral are very variable in appearance; a single species may adopt an encrusting, plate-like, bushy, columnar or massive solid structure, the various forms often being linked to different types of habitat, with variations in light level and water movement being significant.|$|E
5|$|Limnoperdon is a fungal genus in the {{monotypic}} family Limnoperdaceae. The genus is also monotypic, as {{it contains}} a single species, the aquatic fungus Limnoperdon incarnatum. The species, described as new to science in 1976, produces fruit bodies that lack specialized structures such as a stem, cap and gills common in mushrooms. Rather, the fruit bodies—described as aquatic or floating puffballs—are small balls (0.5–1mm diameter) of loosely interwoven hyphae. The balls float {{on the surface of}} the water above submerged twigs. Experimental observations on the development of the fruit body, based on the growth on the fungus in pure culture, suggest that a thin strand of mycelium tethers the ball above water while it matures. Fruit bodies start out as a tuft of hyphae, then become <b>cup-shaped,</b> and eventually enclose around a single chamber that contains reddish spores. Initially discovered in a marsh in the state of Washington, the fungus has since been collected in Japan, South Africa, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Nominate T. merula may {{commence}} breeding in March, but {{eastern and}} Indian races are {{a month or}} more later, and the introduced New Zealand birds start nesting in August (late winter). The breeding pair prospect for a suitable nest site in a creeper or bush, favouring evergreen or thorny species such as ivy, holly, hawthorn, honeysuckle or pyracantha. Sometimes the birds will nest in sheds or outbuildings where a ledge or cavity is used. The <b>cup-shaped</b> nest is made with grasses, leaves and other vegetation, bound together with mud. It is built by the female alone. She lays three to five (usually four) bluish-green eggs marked with reddish-brown blotches, heaviest at the larger end; the eggs of nominate T. merula are 2.9×2.1centimetres (1.14×0.93in) in size and weigh 7.2grammes (0.25oz), of which 6% is shell. Eggs of birds of the southern Indian races are paler than those from the northern subcontinent and Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is from August to January, though dependent on local conditions. The nest site is {{usually in the}} drooping foliage of a tall shrub or low tree, such as Casuarina, Melaleuca, Acacia, and mallee eucalypts. The site is sometimes near to or overhanging water, and the nest is usually constructed {{at the end of}} a drooping branch, suspended from twigs or foliage. The striped honeyeater often nests in the vicinity of a nesting butcherbird. It builds a deep <b>cup-shaped</b> or bag-shaped nest, with thick walls and the lip of the opening turned slightly inwards. The nest is made from thin dry grass and coated with plant down, feathers or wool, the coating often completely obscuring the grass framework. It is lined with spider webs, hair, wool or rootlets, and on occasion flowers and tissue paper. The striped honeyeater will commonly re-use material from previous nests.|$|E
5|$|The female {{song thrush}} builds a neat <b>cup-shaped</b> nest lined with mud and dry grass in a bush, tree or creeper, or, {{in the case}} of the Hebridean subspecies, on the ground. She lays four or five bright glossy blue eggs which are lightly spotted with black or purple; they are {{typically}} 2.7x2.0 centimetres (0.79x1.06in) in size and weigh 6.0grammes (0.21oz), of which 6% is shell. The female incubates the eggs alone for 10–17days, and after hatching a similar time elapses until the young fledge. Two or three broods in a year is normal, although only one may be raised in the north of the range. On average, 54.6% of British juveniles survive the first year of life, and the adult annual survival rate is 62.2%. The typical lifespan is three years, but the maximum recorded age is 10years 8months.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies, or apothecia, of Banksiamyces {{species are}} <b>cup-shaped</b> {{receptacles}} borne on a stipe (stalk), colored dark brown to black {{with a dark}} grey center. When dry, the apothecia are covered with a whitish powder. The edges of the cup may be rolled inwards (especially when dry), or be twisted and somewhat flattened. Both the outermost tissue layer (the ectal excipulum) and the tissue of the stalk are made of fungal cells with brown pigments that can be variously thick- or thin-walled, covered with small particles (granules), and spherical to ellipsoid. The middle tissue layer (the medullary excipulum) of both the cup and the internal tissue layer (the medulla) of the stalk contain a layer of tissue made of hyphae similar to the ectal excipulum. A second layer of tissue is made of hyphae that are translucent and gelatinous; this layer may be present in either the medullary excipulum, the medulla, or both.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} breeding {{habitat in}} Eurasia is open woodland with dense low cover for nesting; despite its name, gardens are rarely occupied by this small passerine bird. The clutch {{of four or}} five blotched cream or white eggs is laid in a robust <b>cup-shaped</b> nest built near the ground and concealed by dense vegetation. The eggs are incubated for 11–12days. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 10days after hatching. Only about a quarter of young birds survive their first year. The garden warbler is strongly migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. A wide range of habitats are used in Africa, but closed forest and treeless Sahel are both shunned. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, although fruit predominates when birds are fattening prior to migration, figs being a particular favourite where available. These warblers have a mixed diet of insects and fruit in their African wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} of a stony coral in the order Scleractinia is secreted by the epidermis of {{the lower part of}} the polyp; this forms a corallite, a <b>cup-shaped</b> hollow made of calcium carbonate, in which the polyp sits. In colonial corals, following growth of the polyp by budding, new corallites are formed, with the surface of the skeleton being covered by a layer of coenosarc. These colonies adopt a range of massive, branching, leaf-like and encrusting forms. Soft corals in the subclass Octocorallia are also colonial and have a skeleton formed of mesogloeal tissue, often reinforced with calcareous spicules or horny material, and some have rod-like supports internally. Other anthozoans, such as sea anemones, are naked; these rely on a hydrostatic skeleton for support. Some of these species have a sticky epidermis to which sand grains and shell fragments adhere, and zoanthids incorporate these substances into their mesogloea.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in {{southeast}} Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and southwest Western Australia in open forest and woodland, and is a common visitor to urban gardens and parks. Loud and conspicuous, the red wattlebird is generally found in trees, where it gets most of its food; occasionally it forages on the ground. It {{is one of the}} largest nectarivorous birds in the world, feeding from a wide variety of flowering plants. Insects also comprise part of its diet. It is territorial and at times aggressive to birds of other species, often defending rich sources of nectar. Breeding throughout its range, the red wattlebird builds a <b>cup-shaped</b> nest in a tree and raises one to two broods a year. Although it has declined in places from land clearing, it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|Across {{most of its}} range, the pied butcherbird can {{generally}} be found breeding from winter to summer; eggs are laid anywhere from July to December, but mostly from September to November, and young can {{be present in the}} nest from August till February. There are reports of breeding outside these months, however. The nest is constructed of dry sticks with a finer material such as dried grass, black roly poly (Sclerolaena muricata), bark and leaves forming a <b>cup-shaped</b> interior. It is located in the fork of a tree, often among foliage and inconspicuous. The clutch consists of two to five (most commonly three or four) oval eggs blotched with brown over a base colour of various shades of pale greyish- or brownish-green. Larger clutches have been recorded, such as at Jandowae in Queensland, where two pairs laid eggs and were sharing incubation duties. Eggs of subspecies nigrogularis are larger, at around 33mm long by 24mm (1.3 by 0.95in) wide, while those of subspecies picatus are around 31mm long by 22mm (1.2 by 0.85in) wide. Incubation takes 19 to 21 days, with the eggs laid up to 48 hours apart and hatching at a similar interval. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial—they are born naked or sparsely covered in down and blind. They spend anywhere from 25 to 33 days in the nest before fledging, though may leave the nest early if disturbed. They are fed by parents and helper birds. Brood parasites recorded include the pallid cuckoo (Cacomantis pallidus) and channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae).|$|E
5|$|Both asexual {{and sexual}} spores or sporangiospores are often {{actively}} dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures {{as well as}} traveling through the air over long distances. Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as hydrophobins), enable efficient spore ejection. For example, {{the structure of the}} spore-bearing cells in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of substances affecting cell volume and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of spores into the air. The forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000g; the net result is that the spore is ejected 0.01–0.02cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below. Other fungi, like the puffballs, rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces. The bird's nest fungi use the force of falling water drops to liberate the spores from <b>cup-shaped</b> fruiting bodies. Another strategy is seen in the stinkhorns, a group of fungi with lively colors and putrid odor that attract insects to disperse their spores.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} animal-pollinated {{flowers were}} shallow, <b>cup-shaped</b> blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established {{before the first}} appearance of bees. The novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. In a process of coevolution, flowers developed floral rewards such as nectar and longer tubes, and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar. Bees also developed structures known as scopal hairs and pollen baskets to collect and carry pollen. The location and type differ among and between groups of bees. Most bees have scopal hairs located on their hind legs or {{on the underside of}} their abdomens, some bees in the family Apidae possess pollen baskets on their hind legs while very few species lack these entirely and instead collect pollen in their crops. This drove the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms, and, in turn, the bees themselves. Bees have not only coevolved with flowers but it is believed that some bees have coevolved with mites. Some bees provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to provide lodgings for mites; in return, it is believed that the mites eat fungi that attack pollen, so the relationship in this case may be mutualistc.|$|E
25|$|Calyx: <b>Cup-shaped,</b> five-toothed.|$|E
25|$|They build a <b>cup-shaped</b> nest among shrubs {{or on the}} ground. Two {{or three}} eggs are laid.|$|E

25|$|Monarchids {{are small}} insectivorous songbirds with long tails. They inhabit forest or {{woodland}} across sub-Saharan Africa, south-east Asia, Australasia {{and a number}} of Pacific islands. Only a few species migrate. Many species decorate their <b>cup-shaped</b> nests with lichen.|$|E
25|$|These scyphate (<b>cup-shaped)</b> coins {{known as}} trachy were issued in both {{electrum}} (debased gold) and billon (debased silver). The exact reason for such coins is not known, {{although it is}} usually theorized that they were shaped for easier stacking.|$|E
