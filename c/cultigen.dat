5|$|The {{history of}} <b>cultigen</b> {{nomenclature}} {{has been discussed}} by William T. Stearn and Brandenberg, Hetterscheid and Berg. It has also been examined from a botanical perspective and from {{the origin of the}} Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 until 2004.|$|E
5|$|The terms <b>cultigen</b> and {{cultivar}} may {{be confused}} with each other. <b>Cultigen</b> is a general-purpose term for plants that have been deliberately altered or specially selected by humans, while cultivar is a formal classification category. Cultigens include not only plants with cultivar names but also those with names in the classification categories of grex and Group. The Cultivated Plant Code points out that cultigens are: deliberately selected plants that may have arisen by intentional or accidental hybridization in cultivation, by selection from existing cultivated stocks, or from variants within wild populations that are maintained as recognizable entities solely by continued propagation. Included within the group of plants known as cultigens are genetically modified plants, plants with binomial Latin names that {{are the result of}} ancient human selection, and any plants that have been altered by humans but which have not been given formal names. In practice most cultigens are cultivars.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Alefeld (1820–1872), {{who used}} Latin variety names, in a {{monographic}} study of beans, lentils and other legumes distinguished three infraspecific taxonomic categories: Unterart (subspecies), Varietäten Gruppe and Kultur-Varietät, all with Latin names. In doing this {{he was probably}} laying the ground for the later establishment of the <b>cultigen</b> classification categories cultivar and Group. In conjunction with the Brussels International Botanical Congress of 1910 there was an International Horticultural Congress having a horticultural nomenclature component.|$|E
50|$|Not all <b>cultigens</b> {{have been}} given names {{according}} to the Cultivated Plant Code. Apart from ancient <b>cultigens</b> like those mentioned above there may be occasional anthropogenic plants {{such as those that}} are the result of breeding, selection, and tissue grafting that are of no commercial value and have therefore not been given names according to the ICNCP.|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} the greenhouse. In one experiment, cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and horned cucumber (C. metuliferus) <b>cultigens</b> were evaluated for resistance to four root-knot nematode species (Meloidogyne arenaria, M. hapla, M. incognita, and M. javanica), and, in a second experiment, a standard (12 -week) test was compared with a rapid (6 -week) test. In the first experiment, horned cucumber <b>cultigens</b> varied {{in response to the}} Meloidogyne species. 'Sumter' cucumber was more susceptible than the horned cucumber to Meloidogyne incognita, M. javanica, and M. arenaria. All <b>cultigens</b> were more resistant to M. hapla than to the other root-knot nematode species. In the second experiment, best results were obtained when the test was run for 12 weeks rather than 6 weeks after planting (or 10 and 4 weeks after inoculation, respectively). All <b>cultigens</b> were more resistant to M. arenaria than to either M. incognita or M. javanica...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 A concern {{which has}} {{restricted}} {{the use of}} parthenocarpic pickling cucumbers in the United States has been firmness of fruit processed by brining. Fruit firmness and defects of parthenocarpic and nonparthenocarpic pickling cucumbers were evaluated in 1992 and 1993. Fruits were produced with or without pollination by growing plants with or without floating row covers to exclude pollen vectors. Parthenocarpic <b>cultigens</b> grown with row covers {{were not significantly different}} from nonparthenocarpic <b>cultigens</b> grown without row covers for fresh fruit firmness in both years. Processed fruit firmness was similar in 1992, but less for parthenocarpic <b>cultigens</b> in 1993. Combining ability of a parthenocarpic and nonparthenocarpic set of parents for fruit firmness and related morphological characteristics were investigated using a factorial mating design. General combining ability was greater than specific combining ability for all traits of fresh and most traits of processed fruit, indicating primarily additive inheritance. Fruit, mesocarp, and endocarp firmness, length, and length:diameter ratio were positively correlated phenotypically and genetically. Seed cavity diameter and seed cavity:fruit diameter ratio were positively correlated phenotypically and genetically, but negatively correlated to all other traits. Generation means analysis was used to determine the relative importance of genetic effects in the inheritance of fruit and mesocarp firmness in crosses between parthenocarpic and nonparthenocarpic pickling cucumbers. The primary genetic effects in crosses between parents with extreme differences for firmness were additive. Epistatic effects were also detected, but the nature of these effects could not be determined because the generations required for such analyses were unavailable. One parental inbred line was evaluated as a potential donor of favorable alleles for improvement of firmness using several statistics and was not a source. The endogenous calcium concentration of cucumber tissue influences tissue softening and effectiveness of calcium applications for firmness retention during processing. Genetic differences for fruit calcium concentration in <b>cultigens</b> which differ in fruit firmness were investigated. <b>Cultigens</b> were not different in fruit calcium concentration, thus a relationship between fruit calcium concentration and fruit tissue firmness among <b>cultigens</b> was not shown...|$|R
5|$|The early {{development}} of <b>cultigen</b> taxonomy follows that of plant taxonomy in general {{as the early}} listing and documentation of plants made little distinction between those that were anthropogenic and those that were natural wild kinds. Formal botanical nomenclature and classification evolved from the simple binomial system of folk taxonomy {{and it was not}} until the mid-19th century that the nomenclatural path of cultigens began to diverge from mainstream plant taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{cultivated}} plant taxonomy {{can be traced}} from the first plant selections {{that occurred during the}} agrarian Neolithic Revolution to the first recorded naming of human plant selections by the Romans. The naming and classification of cultigens followed a similar path to that of all plants until the establishment of the first Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 which formally established the <b>cultigen</b> classification category of cultivar. Since that time the classification and naming of cultigens has followed its own path.|$|E
25|$|The asterid eudicots contain two {{economically}} important geophyte genera, Dahlia and Liatris. Horticulturally {{the garden}} dahlia is usually treated as the <b>cultigen</b> D. variabilis Hort., which while {{being responsible for}} thousands of cultivars has an obscure taxonomic status (see also Cultivation).|$|E
50|$|Plant {{breeding}} {{has been}} used for thousands of years, and began with the domestication of wild plants into uniform and predictable agricultural <b>cultigens.</b> High-yielding varieties have been particularly important in agriculture.|$|R
50|$|The Deptford culture (800 BCE—700 CE) was {{characterized}} {{by the appearance of}} elaborate ceremonial complexes, increasing social and political complexity, mound burial, permanent settlements, population growth, and an increasing reliance on <b>cultigens.</b>|$|R

25|$|In the {{original}} description Passiflora tarminina {{is described as}} a <b>cultigen</b> and there is little information about its biology in the wild. Many members of the subgenus Tacsonia are restricted endemics and it is unclear whether the widely cultivated species (such as P. tarminiana) are also local endemics which have been spread through widespread cultivation or whether they are naturally widespread species. The type specimen is from a cultivated rather than a wild plant.|$|E
25|$|One author {{postulated}} that {{the origin of}} I. batatas was between the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico and {{the mouth of the}} Orinoco River in Venezuela. The <b>cultigen</b> had most likely been spread by local people to the Caribbean and South America by 2500 BC. Strong supporting evidence was provided that the geographical zone postulated by Austin is the primary center of diversity. The much lower molecular diversity found in Peru–Ecuador suggests this region should be considered as a secondary center of sweet potato diversity.|$|E
25|$|The Red Delicious is a clone {{of apple}} <b>cultigen,</b> now {{comprising}} more than 50 cultivars. The Red Delicious apple {{was discovered in}} 1875 by Jesse Hiatt on his farm in Peru, Iowa. Believing that the seedling {{was nothing more than}} nuisance. After chopping down the tree three times, Hiatt decided to let the tree grow and eventually, it produced an unknown and new harvest of red apples. Hiatt would eventually sell the rights to this type of apple to the Stark Brothers Nurseries and Orchards who renamed it the Red Delicious.|$|E
5000|$|The Cultivated Plant Code, however, {{states that}} <b>cultigens</b> are [...] "maintained as {{recognisable}} entities solely by continued propagation", and thus would not include plants that have evolved subsequent {{to escape from}} cultivation.|$|R
500|$|The ways {{in which}} the plant {{variation}} resulting from human activity is named and classified remains contentious. The replacement of the expression [...] "cultivated plant" [...] with the word [...] "cultigen" [...] is not universally accepted. The debate continues concerning the notions of ranks and taxa as applied to <b>cultigens.</b> Is it appropriate to call the highly modified transgenic products of human artificial selection [...] "taxa" [...] in the same way we do for the products of natural selection in the wild? To overcome this difficulty the term culton (pl. culta) has been suggested to replace the word taxon when speaking about <b>cultigens.</b>|$|R
50|$|The International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP), {{also known}} as the Cultivated Plant Code, is a guide to the rules and {{regulations}} for naming <b>cultigens,</b> plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity. <b>Cultigens</b> under the purview of the ICNCP include cultivars, Groups (cultivar groups), and grexes. All organisms traditionally considered to be plants (including algae and fungi) are included. Taxa that receive a name under the ICNCP will also be included within taxa named under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, for example, a cultivar is a member of a species.|$|R
500|$|Most cultigens {{have names}} {{consisting}} of a Latin name that is governed by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants e.g. Malus domestica, to which is added a <b>cultigen</b> epithet, enclosed in single quotes e.g. Malus domestica 'Granny Smith'. The formation {{and use of the}} three classification categories (ranks) used for cultigens, the cultivar, Group and grex, is regulated by the ICNCP. Examples of acceptable ways to present <b>cultigen</b> names are given below: ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{community}} of people dealing with the cultigens of commerce grew so, once again, the divergence between taxonomy serving scientific purposes and utilitarian taxonomy meeting human needs re-emerged. In 1865 German botanist Karl Koch, who became General Secretary of the Berlin Horticultural Society, expressed resentment at the continued use of Latin for <b>cultigen</b> names. Many proposals {{to deal with this}} were made, perhaps the most prominent being the Lois de la nomenclature botanique submitted in 1867 to the fourth Horticultural and Botanical Congress by Swiss botanist Alphonse de Candolle who, in Article 40 stated: ...|$|E
500|$|Salvia divinorum [...] (also {{known as}} sage of the diviners, ska maría pastora, seer's sage, yerba de la pastora and just salvia) is a psychoactive plant which can induce visions and other spiritual experiences. Its native habitat is in cloud {{forest in the}} {{isolated}} Sierra Mazateca of Oaxaca, Mexico, where it grows in shady and moist locations. The plant grows to over a meter high, has hollow square stems, large leaves, and occasional white flowers with violet calyxes. Botanists have not determined whether Salvia divinorum is a <b>cultigen</b> or a hybrid; native plants reproduce vegetatively, rarely producing viable seed.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of general dissatisfaction and a {{submission}} from the Royal Horticultural Society the Règles de Nomenclature Horticole was established. The use of simple descriptive Latin names (e.g. compactus, nanus, prostratus) for horticultural variants was accepted and so too were names in the local language – which {{were not to be}} translated and should preferably consist of one word and a maximum of three. This first Horticultural Code consisted of 16 Articles. With the intercession of a World War I {{it was not until the}} 9th Horticultural Congress in London in 1930 that the rules of a Horticulture Nomenclature Committee were agreed and added as an appendix to the 1935 Botanical Code. The rules established in 1935 were accepted but needed to be extended to include the cultigens of agriculture and forestry, but it was only {{a result of}} discussions at the 1950 International Botanical Congress in Stockholm and the 18th International Horticultural Congress in London in 1952 the first International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants was published in 1953. The American horticultural botanist Liberty Hyde Bailey was responsible for coining the word <b>cultigen</b> in 1918 ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first record}} of a named <b>cultigen</b> occurs in De Agri Cultura. written about 160 BCE by Roman statesman Cato the Elder (234–149 BCE) in a list that {{includes}} 120 kinds (cultivars) of figs, grapes, apples and olives. The names are presented {{in a way that}} implies that they would have been familiar to fellow Romans. The [...] "cultivar" [...] names were mostly of one word and denoted the provenance of the cultivar (the geographical origin of the place where the plant selections were made). Writers up to the 15th century added little to this early work. In the Middle Ages the book of hours, early herbals, illuminated manuscripts and economic records indicate that plants grown by the Romans found their way into monastery gardens. For example, in 827 CE the following herbs were mentioned in the poem Hortulus by Walafrid Strabo as growing in the monastery garden of St Gallen in Switzerland: sage, rue, southernwood, wormwood, horehound, fennel, German iris, lovage, chervil, Madonna lily, opium poppy, clary, mint, betony, agrimony, catmint, radish, gallica rose, bottle gourd and melon. It seems likely that aromatic and culinary herbs were quite widespread and similar lists of plants occur in records of plants grown in Villa gardens at the time of Charlemagne (742–814 CE).|$|E
2500|$|Okra is an {{allopolyploid}} of uncertain parentage (proposed parents include Abelmoschus ficulneus, A.tuberculatus and {{a reported}} [...] "diploid" [...] form of okra).

500|$|... and {{cultivar}} in 1923, {{the word}} cultivar only coming into general circulation {{with the new}} Code of 1953. The use of these two terms belies the [...] multitude of classification terms and categories that had been suggested as designations for <b>cultigens.</b>|$|R
40|$|Among {{many species}} in the genus Tobamovirus, Kyuri green mottle mosaic virus (KGMMV) {{is known as a}} major seed-borne virus infecting cucurbit plants, {{including}} melon, which possesses no known resistance. The identification of genetic resistance to KGMMV in Indonesia (KGMMV-YM) in melons is of economic importance. Thus, 45 melon <b>cultigens</b> collected from 17 Asian countries were screened by manual virus inoculation and resistance to KGMMV-YM was examined by visual observation, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results show that resistance to KGMMV-YM was found in Mawatauri, Kohimeuri, PI 161375 and PI 371795, and analysis by RT-PCR showed the presence of KGMMV-YM in susceptible <b>cultigens</b> as early as 3 days after leaf inoculation...|$|R
500|$|<b>Cultigens</b> of {{our most}} common {{economic}} plants probably {{date back to the}} first settled communities of the Neolithic Revolution 10,000 to 12,000 years ago although their exact time and place of true origin will probably remain a mystery. [...] In the Western world among the first <b>cultigens</b> would have been selections of the cereals wheat and barley that arose in the early settlements of the Fertile Crescent (the fertile river valleys of the Nile, Tigris and Euphrates) in the Western Mediterranean. Food plant selections would also {{have been made in the}} ten or so other centres of settlement that occurred around the world at this time. Confining crops to local areas gave rise to landraces (selections that are highly adapted to local conditions) although these are now largely replaced by modern cultivars. Cuttings are an extremely effective way of perpetuating desirable characters, especially of woody plants like grapes, figs and olives so it is not surprising that these are among the first known plant selections perpetuated in cultivation in the West. Migrating people would take their plant seeds and cuttings with them; there is evidence of early Fertile Crescent cereal <b>cultigens</b> being transferred from Western Asia to surrounding lands.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{strongly}} suspect, however, {{that what}} catapulted hemp to sudden {{fame and fortune}} as a <b>cultigen</b> and caused it to spread rapidly westwards in the first millennium B.C. was {{the spread of the}} habit of pot-smoking from somewhere in south-central Asia, where the drug-bearing variety of the plant originally occurred. The linguistic evidence strongly supports this theory, both as to time and direction of spread and as to cause." ...|$|E
5000|$|The terms <b>cultigen</b> and {{cultivar}} may {{be confused}} with each other. A <b>cultigen</b> is any plant deliberately altered or selected for cultivation by humans; the Cultivated Plant Code states that cultigens are [...] "maintained as recognisable entities solely by continued propagation". A <b>cultigen</b> or a component of a <b>cultigen,</b> which is recognisable and stable, can be accepted as a cultivar.|$|E

40|$|Northern Minnesota {{lies within}} the {{southern}} edge of the Boreal Forest and, as a result, archaeological sites in this region typically have poor organic preservation and thin, disturbed, stratigraphy. For this reason, little is known about specific plant foods and their importance at many sites. In order to fill this gap, my research focuses on the extraction of plant microfossils (starch, phytoliths and pollen) from carbonized and non- carbonized food residues associated with Middle Woodland (100 BC ? AD 500) components. My results show that wild rice was widely consumed during this time along with <b>cultigens</b> such as maize. No additional evidence suggested farming, so there is a possibility of trade with periphery groups to acquire the <b>cultigens</b> recovered from the microfossil analysis. These results demonstrate the importance of plant microfossil studies as a tool for identifying subtle evidence of wild and domesticated plants in regions characterized by poor organic preservation, small seasonally-occupied sites and other fundamental limitations. The mixed economic strategy apparent in some Northern Minnesota sites re-defines a diet of native and domesticated <b>cultigens,</b> which {{can be applied to the}} wider archaeobotanical literature of northeastern North America...|$|R
50|$|Glycoalkaloids are {{typically}} bitter tasting, {{and produce a}} burning irritation {{in the back of}} the mouth and side of the tongue when eaten.

40|$|Most genetic models assume {{absence of}} {{epistasis}} while estimating components of genetic variation. However, epistasis when present introduces bias. These biased estimates affect the progress in a breeding program since they influence {{the choice of}} breeding methodology. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the significance of epistasis in the inheritance of pod yield and related traits in 15 peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) <b>cultigens,</b> and to estimate the additive and dominance variances for the traits not influenced by epistasis. Two <b>cultigens</b> and their F, hybrid were each crossed to 15 <b>cultigens</b> from 13 countries, representing three botanical groups. The experiment was conducted in the 1992 - 1993 post-rainy and 1993 rainy environments at the ICRISAT Asia Center, Patancheru, India. The deviations were analyzed to detect epistasis of 11 traits. Epistasis affected the expression of eight traits in both environments. Environments interacted more strongly with epistatic gene actions than with additive or dominance gene actions. Expression of epistasis was influenced by genotypes and environments, indicating the need for more genotypes and environments for effective detection of epistasis. Evidence for additive genetic variance and lower levels of partial dominance for canopy breadth and additive and dominance variances and complete dominance for shelling outturn was obtained in the post-rainy environment...|$|R
