Its {{structures}} use the water of the American River, which drains off the Sierra Nevada and flows into the Sacramento River. The division is further divided into three units: the Folsom, Sly Park and Auburn-Folsom South. The American River Division stores water in the American River watershed, to both provide water supply for local settlements, and supply it to the rest of the system. The dams also are an important flood <b>control</b> <b>measure.</b> Hydroelectricity is generated at Folsom and Nimbus dams, and marketed to the Western Area Power Administration.|$|E
25|$|The Bay checkerspot went locally extinct {{during the}} early 2000s, last {{observed}} at Edgewood Park in 2002. This local extinction {{has been attributed to}} nitrogen deposition from cars traveling on adjacent Interstate 280, which fertilized invasive Italian ryegrass and choked out native plants required by the butterflies. However, the Italian ryegrass was intentionally planted as an erosion <b>control</b> <b>measure</b> mandated by San Mateo County Planning Department after construction of PG high power lines that cross the park, and spread into the park from that location. Subsequently, attempts to restore the habitat by mowing at an appropriate time of year to reduce the Italian ryegrass and allow the native plants to regrow. In early 2007, 1000 Bay checkerspot larvae were reintroduced to the park.|$|E
25|$|Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) {{attempted}} {{to pass a}} more limited gun <b>control</b> <b>measure</b> that would have expanded background checks, but the bill was blocked in the Senate. Despite Obama's advocacy and subsequent mass shootings such as the Charleston church shooting, no major gun control bill passed Congress during Obama's presidency, {{in part due to}} the power of 2nd Amendment activists such as the National Rifle Association. Obama's presidency ironically saw expansion of gun rights in the United States, as the Supreme Court ruled in McDonald v. City of Chicago that the Second Amendment applies to the states in addition to the federal government. Obama signed into law two bills containing amendments reducing restrictions on gun owners, one which permitted guns to be transported in checked baggage on Amtrak trains and another which allowed the carrying of loaded firearms in national parks located in states allowing concealed carry.|$|E

A difference is made between Technical means which can be applied in installations and for the sealing of the soil surface and <b>Control</b> <b>measures</b> which {{can be divided into}} technical <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> and management <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> The findings of this survey are that the actually achieved level of soil protection depends on the combination of technical means and <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> This signifies that technical means and <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> cannot be considered separately. An evaluation of the different methods for soil protection can therefore only be made in a framework which allows for the comparison of the combinations of technical means and <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> Sources of emissions and their patterns are described as well as the adequate means and measures for soil protection. Risk-reducing design approaches and management methods are explained and some methods of risk-assessment are mentioned briefly. The report includes a recommendation to investigate the possibilities of defining a specified and quantitative level of soil protection by using risk-analysis. This approach should then be used for the evaluation of different combinations of technical means and <b>control</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

The nurse works with different patients and can therefore {{be a source of}} infection. The patients in the critical care units are especially susceptible to infections, because their immune systems are susceptible to diseases, surgical interventions, mal-nutrition, indwelling lines and -catheters. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the application of infection <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> in critical care units of a private hospital. Guidelines were developed to improve the application of infection <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> The purpose is attained by firstly the evaluation of the application of infection <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> by critical care nurses and secondly by determining if the structure of the critical care units facilitate the application of infection <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> This is done {{with the aid of a}} literature-based control list. A literature survey is done to compile the control list. A contextual, descriptive research design was used for this study.

40|$|This study {{considered}} a simple SIR {{model for the}} spread of epidemics amongst holdings of a producer community in Northern Germany, based on the directed network of animal movements. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficiency of different <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> to reduce the epidemic size substantially. The currently applied <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> based on the distance to an infected holding were compared with the <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> based on the specific network-based centrality parameters. We found that network-based measures led to a more efficient control of epidemics with a much smaller number of removed holdings. To assess the impact of different holding types, the analysed <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> were implemented by both including and excluding these holding types. The comparison revealed a crucial role of multipliers in the spread of an epidemic. The network- based <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> depending on the removal by out-degree, outgoing infection chain, betweenness centrality and outgoing closeness centrality showed the best results: In the three-year network, on average, 2. 75, 4. 15, 3. 73 and 3. 43 times more holdings had to be removed by the <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> based on the 1, 3, 5 and 10 km radius to reduce the epidemic to the same size compared with the network-based <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> In an area with a higher holding density, the improvement of the network-based <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> may become even more obvious. The removal of holdings based on the above-mentioned centrality parameters did thus not only rapidly decompose the network into fragments, but also reduced the epidemic size most efficiently...|$|R

The opponents contend that hundreds of trucks would be required that would increase pollution and noise. They also say that the wildlife habitat will be destroyed and interfere with hikers, cyclists and horseback riders who use the area for recreation.

[...] Columnist Alex Magno in The Philippine Star wrote about the [...] "immaturity" [...] of the diplomatic response of the newly installed Aquino administration in what is commonly seen as its first serious leadership test of the administration, in its first one hundred days in office. Magno listed a string of mistakes from the administration, starting with how it failed to initiate contact with the Hong Kong government, to how it insulted the Hong Kong Chief Executive by not promptly responding to his call, and then later unilaterally announcing the sending of a high level delegation to the Hong Kong and Chinese governments in what Magno interpreted as a damage <b>control</b> <b>measure</b> without first confirming that Hong Kong and the PRC would receive the delegation.

[...] John Nery writing in The Philippine Daily Inquirer said it was indeed appropriate for Aquino to have kept his distance from the crisis management, despite the hands-on approach the general public was demanding with hindsight; he said the skepticism directed towards the Aquino administration was not being applied equally to the Tsang administration's account of trying unsuccessfully to reach Aquino since 4pm. [...] Analysts agreed that the Aquino administration's approval rating would fall, {{if not for the}} handling of the hostage taking crisis, then from a natural move off the high it was coming from.|$|E
