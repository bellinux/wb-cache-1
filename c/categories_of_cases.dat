25|$|There {{are three}} types of general trial courts in Putnam County: the New York Supreme Court, the County Court and the Justice Courts. The Supreme Court is the trial level court of the New York State Unified Court System, which {{presents}} some confusion as the Supreme Court is the highest court of appeals in the federal system {{as well as in}} most states, whereas the Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York. The Supreme Court has broad authority over all <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> both civil and criminal. Generally the Supreme Court in Putnam hears civil cases involving claims in excess of $25,000. While the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over criminal cases in most counties this is handled by the County Courts. In Putnam however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases.|$|E

5000|$|Despite this controversy, the {{statement}} by Justice Deane appears to remain an accurate {{statement of the}} place of unjust enrichment in the Anglo-Australian law of obligations: [...] "concept of unjust enrichment constitutes a unifying legal concept which explains why the law recognises, in a variety <b>of</b> distinct <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>case,</b> an obligation {{on the part of}} a defendant to make fair and just restitution for a benefit derived at the expense of a plaintiff and which assists in the determination, by the ordinary processes of legal reasoning, of the question whether the law should, in justice, recognise such an obligation in a new or developing <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>case.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{second point}} {{concerned}} whether the plaintiffs had the requisite standing {{to bring their}} action against the NZRFU. The Court rejected the plaintiffs argument that implied contracts linked each of them with the NZRFU. However it approved earlier judgments that standing could be granted to those claiming an incorporated association acted beyond its powers even where no contract existed. Here Cooke J said, In cases where an incorporated association {{is alleged to have}} acted against its objects but the plaintiff cannot show a contract, we think that all the circumstances have to be considered - case by <b>case</b> or <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> by <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> - in order to determine as a question of mixed law and fact whether or not he or she has sufficient standing.|$|R
5000|$|For certain limited <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> {{the state}} supreme court still {{operates}} under mandatory review, usually with regard to cases involving the interpretation of the state constitution or capital punishment. But for the vast majority, {{the state supreme}} court possesses the discretion to grant certiorari (known as review in states that discourage the use of Latin). These cases usually pertain to issues which different appellate courts within its jurisdiction have decided differently, or highly controversial cases involving a completely new legal issue never seen in that state. In other words, once {{the state supreme court}} is able to offload the tedious burden of error correction to intermediate courts, it can then focus on the long-term task (i.e., a policymaking role) of developing a coherent body of case law for the people of its state.|$|E

Although the House rejected this modest extension of removal and passed a bill to make only minor revisions in the law, Senator Matthew Carpenter of Wisconsin proposed amendments to grant full federal jurisdiction to the United States circuit courts and guarantee the right of removal in any civil case arising under federal law or in which there was diversity of citizenship, with the $500 threshold applying to both <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases.</b> The debate in Congress focused on the growing significance of interstate commerce and the economic benefits of a uniform system of justice.|$|E

The analysis shows that the construction of formal models <b>of</b> grammatical <b>categories</b> is impossible without referring to the content of the dominant semantic features in the structure of grammatical meaning. Despite all the difficulties of modeling grammatical semantics, to construct a semantic model <b>of</b> <b>case</b> is an interesting and promising task of general morphology and typological linguistics...|$|R

5000|$|As {{justification}} for any derogation from the European Convention ultimately {{rests on the}} concept of democratic necessity in a society, margins of appreciation are situation-oriented and the case law regarding this subject frequently lacks consistency. The expanded margin of appreciation doctrine has been used to interpret European Convention guarantees regarding due process (that is, Articles 5 and 6) and personal freedoms (that is, Articles 8-11). This infused the doctrine with a sense of ubiquity and has led to its invocation in major legal developments, including challenges surrounding discrimination as they relate to human rights. However, the doctrine has also been invoked in such varied questions as the enjoyment of possessions, the use of religious symbols [...] and the implementation of environmental policies and regulations. The margin of appreciation in each of these <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> has differed according to the kind of right in question; for example, where private individuals are more directly involved, less discretion is typically permitted to the discretion of state parties. Naturally, this criterion comes under just one of the three criteriathat is, the nature of the right, the aims pursued, as well as {{the presence or absence of}} a European consensusthat are used to determine the scope of any given margin.

5000|$|The point made {{in these}} cases is that the key {{component}} of the two <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> identified by Lord Denning in Bratty is an accused’s inability to control their behaviour and not {{the way in which}} loss or impairment of the conscious or deliberative functions of the mind arises. Similarly, under the Swedish Penal Code, acts during sleep and unconsciousness, reflex movements, spasms and convulsions, as well as acts performed under physical force or hypnosis are generally not punishable. Moreover, omissions caused by sleep, weakness, physical numbness or anaesthesia are generally not blameworthy. The issue is whether the accused had the ability to control the behaviour, including taking early precautions to avoid loss of control. But, in English law, the ruling in R v Sullivan (1984) AC 156 held that, {{for the purposes of the}} M'Naghten Rules, a disease of the mind need have no permanence, leading many academics to suggest that sleepwalkers might well be found to be suffering from a disease of the mind with internal causes unless there was clear evidence of an external causal factor. In R v Burgess (1991) 2 WLR 1206 the Court of Appeal ruled that the defendant who wounded a woman by hitting her with a video recorder while sleepwalking, was insane under the M'Naghten Rules. Lord Lane said, [...] "We accept that sleep is a normal condition, but the evidence in the instant case indicates that sleepwalking, and particularly violence in sleep, is not normal." ...|$|E
