5|$|Despite {{the declining}} {{prevalence}} of marriage, {{more than three-quarters}} of Americans will marry at least once in their lifetime. The average age for marriage for a male was 26.8 and 25.1 for a female. Americans are also likely to remarry after their first divorce. In 1990, 40% of all marriages were remarriages. All together one <b>can</b> <b>conclude</b> that while there is no prevalent average household arrangement, most Americans (the average Joe) will get married and divorced once with a considerable number of Americans remarrying at least once.|$|E

25|$|Gary Becker, for example, {{acknowledged}} {{that many people}} operate under a high moral and ethical constraint but considered that criminals rationally see {{that the benefits of}} their crime outweigh the cost such as the probability of apprehension, conviction, punishment, as well as their current set of opportunities. From the public policy perspective, since the cost of increasing the fine is marginal to that of the cost of increasing surveillance, one <b>can</b> <b>conclude</b> that the best policy is to maximize the fine and minimize surveillance.|$|E
25|$|Which means: if P and its {{negation}} ¬P {{are both}} {{assumed to be}} true, then P {{is assumed to be}} true, from which it follows {{that at least one of}} the claims P and some other (arbitrary) claim A is true. However, if we know that either P or A is true, and also that P is not true (that ¬P is true) we <b>can</b> <b>conclude</b> that A, which could be anything, is true. Thus if a theory contains a single inconsistency, it is trivial—that is, it has every sentence as a theorem.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} {{among white}} Americans was less substantial. In 2005, 75.8% of white Americans owned their own homes, compared to 70% in 1993, {{and the rate}} fell during {{the last half of}} the decade of the 2000s, slightly more slowly than for the rest of the population. Thus one <b>can</b> <b>conclude</b> that despite a large remaining discrepancy between the homeownership rates among different racial groups, the gap had been closing up until the peak, with ownership rates increasing more substantially for minorities than for whites, but subsequently began slightly widening.|$|E

25|$|The {{proportion}} {{of land in}} each province confiscated by the Romans after conquest is unknown. But {{there are a few}} clues. Egypt is by far the best-documented province due to the survival of papyri in the dry conditions. There, it appears that probably a third of land was ager publicus. From the evidence available one <b>can</b> <b>conclude</b> that, between imperial estates, land assigned to coloniae, and land sold to Roman private landowners, a province's peregrini may have lost ownership of over half their land {{as a result of the}} Roman conquest. Roman colonists would routinely help themselves to the best land.|$|E
25|$|Nationally we <b>can</b> <b>conclude</b> with {{confidence}} that between {{one in three}} and one in ten Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families and communities in the period from approximately 1910 until 1970. In certain regions and in certain periods the figure was undoubtedly much greater than one in ten. In that time not one family has escaped the effects of forcible removal (confirmed by representatives of the Queensland and WA Governments in evidence to the Inquiry). Most families have been affected, {{in one or more}} generations, by the forcible removal of one or more children.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the fact}} that writing {{sentences}} and reading them are coordinated using and, one <b>can</b> <b>conclude</b> that they are constituents. The validity of the coordination test is challenged by additional data, however. The latter two sentences, which are instances of so-called right node raising, suggest that the sequences in bold should be understood as constituents. Most grammars do not view sequences such as He enjoys to the exclusion of the VP writing sentences as a constituent. Thus while the coordination test is widely employed as a diagnostic for constituent structure, it is faced with major difficulties and is therefore perhaps the least reliable of all the tests mentioned.|$|E

25|$|In {{decision}} theory, and {{in particular}} in choice under uncertainty, an agent is described as making an optimal choice {{in the context of}} incomplete information. For risk neutral agents, the choice involves using the expected values of uncertain quantities, while for risk averse agents it involves maximizing the expected value of some objective function such as a von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function. One example of using expected value in reaching optimal decisions is the Gordon–Loeb model of information security investment. According to the model, one <b>can</b> <b>conclude</b> that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be {{only a small fraction of}} the expected loss (i.e., the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyber/information security breach).|$|E
25|$|However, {{despite the}} {{uncertain}} origins, {{there are enough}} similarities in the ideas of practices of Chinese alchemy and the Daoist tradition so that one <b>can</b> <b>conclude</b> that Laozi and Chang Tao Ling are the creators of this tradition. In her article, Radcliffe tells that Chang Tao Ling rejected serving the Emperor and retreated {{to live in the}} mountains. At this time, he met Laozi and together they created (or attempted to create) the Elixir of Life (Radcliffe, 2001), by creating the theory that would be used in order to achieve the making of such an elixir. This is the starting point to the Chinese tradition of alchemy, whose purpose was to achieve immortality.|$|E
25|$|Inductive {{learning}} {{problem can}} occur as words are oftentimes used in ambiguous {{situations in which}} there are more than one possible referents available. This can lead to confusion for the infants as {{they may not be able}} to distinguish which words should be extended to label objects being referenced to. Smith and Yu proposed that a way to make a distinction in such ambiguous situations is to track the word-referent pairings over multiple scenes. For instance, an infant who hears a word in the presence of object A and object B will be unsure of whether the word is the referent of object A or object B. However, if the infant then hears the label again in the presence of object B and object C, the infant <b>can</b> <b>conclude</b> that object B is the referent of the label because object B consistently pairs with the label across different situations.|$|E

25|$|One <b>can</b> <b>conclude</b> {{that certain}} {{essential}}, or fundamental, rights should exist in any just society. It {{does not follow}} that each of those essential rights is one that we as judges can enforce under the written Constitution. The Due Process Clause is not a guarantee of every right that should inhere in an ideal system. Many argue that a just society grants a right to engage in homosexual conduct. If that view is accepted, the Bowers decision in effect says the State of Georgia {{has the right to}} make a wrong decision—wrong {{in the sense that it}} violates some people's views of rights in a just society. We can extend that slightly to say that Georgia's right to be wrong in matters not specifically controlled by the Constitution is a necessary component of its own political processes. Its citizens have the political liberty to direct the governmental process to make decisions that might be wrong in the ideal sense, subject to correction in the ordinary political process.|$|E
25|$|The second {{method used}} was the linear-plus-cubic diffusion, {{which is a}} model of fault scarping. This method uses the {{diffusive}} process on hill slopes, such as rain-splash and wind erosion, that move sediment down hill. t = t’(SO)*2/k (0). The last method used to date the faulting was the morphologic dating without numerical model. Such a technique requires that down slope debris instability is a timedependent function of slope angle, in units of volume per time per length of contour (Nash, 2005). The scarp ages can be determined based on the relationship Ta/Tb = H*-2 b / H-2 b From the first method we <b>can</b> <b>conclude</b> that there were at least five seismic events that did not occur at the same time. From method two we can say than the faulting ages between 57ka to 377ka with surface offset of 11.2m that had a magnitude of 6-7 earthquakes. Finally the third method of dating concludes that the relative ages of the east Potrillo fault scarps ranges form 153,000 to 239,000.|$|E
25|$|In 565/6 Dioscorus left Aphrodito for Antinoopolis, {{the capital}} city of the Thebaid and the {{residence}} of the doux. He remained there for about seven years. His motivation for the move is nowhere made clear. But surmising from the surviving documents, one <b>can</b> <b>conclude</b> that he was attracted by the opportunity to advance his legal career in the proximity of the Duke and likewise was compelled by the increasing violence of the pagarch against Aphrodito and his own family. The legal documents from that period show that Dioscorus wrote the final will for the Surgeon General (Phoebammon), arbitrated in family property disputes, composed marriage and divorce contracts, and continued writing petitions about the offenses of the pagarch. One such petition, P.Cair.Masp. I 67002, describes how a group of Aphroditans {{on their way to the}} annual cattle market were ambushed. They were eventually put into a prison in Antaeopolis, under the control of the pagarch Menas, where they were tortured and robbed and their animals were seized. Menas and his men then attacked the village of Aphrodito itself: he blocked the irrigation, extorted money, burned down homes, and violated the nuns. All these crimes were committed in the name of collecting the public taxes, although Aphrodito had never failed a payment and Menas had no right to collect them. A formal explanation, P.Lond. V 1677, describes the attacks by Menas on Dioscorus himself and his family. He seized property owned by Dioscorus and transferred it to his assistants, leaving Dioscorus with only the tax liability. Menas proceeded to pillage the home of Dioscorus's brother-in-law and seized his land too, reducing him and his family to poverty. He then arrested Dioscorus's own son.|$|E
