40|$|Abstract Background Main {{scope of}} the EU and FDA {{regulations}} {{is to establish a}} classification criterion for advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP). Regulations require that ATMPs must be prepared under good manufacturing practice (GMP). We have validated a commercial system for the determination of bacterial endotoxins in compliance with EU Pharmacopoeia 2. 6. 14, the sterility testing in compliance with EU Pharmacopoeia 2. 6. 1 and a potency assay in an ATMP constituted of mononucleated cells used in cardiac regeneration. Methods For the potency assay, cells were placed in the upper part of a modified Boyden chamber containing Endocult Basal Medium with supplements and transmigrated cells were scored. The invasion index was expressed as the ratio between the numbers of invading cells relative to cell migration through a <b>control</b> <b>insert</b> membrane. For endotoxins, we used a commercially available system based on the kinetic chromogenic LAL-test. Validation of sterility was performed by direct inoculation of TSB and FTM media with the cell product following Eu Ph 2. 6. 1 guideline. Results and discussion The calculated MVD and endotoxin limit were 780 × and 39 EU/ml respectively. The 1 : 10 and 1 : 100 dilutions were selected for the validation. For sterility, all the FTM cultures were positive after 3 days. For TSB cultures, Mycetes and B. subtilis were positive after 5 and 3 days respectively. The detection limit was 1 - 10 colonies. A total of four invasion assay were performed: the calculated invasion index was 28. 89 ± 16. 82 % (mean ± SD). Conclusion We have validated a strategy for endotoxin, sterility and potency testing in an ATMP used in cardiac regeneration. Unlike pharmaceutical products, many stem-cell-based products may originate in hospitals where personnel are unfamiliar with the applicable regulations. As new ATMPs are developed, the regulatory framework is likely to evolve. Meanwhile, existing regulations provide an appropriate structure for ensuring the safety and efficacy of the next generation of ATMPs. Personnel must be adequately trained on relevant methods and their application to stem-cell-based products. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} cause of cancer-related deaths in North America is lung cancer, 85 % of which is non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Gene therapy is a {{promising}} approach, but has been hindered by lack of methods for localizing and quantifying gene expression in vivo. Human somatostatin receptor subtype- 2 (SSTR 2) -based reporters can be used to follow gene expression in vivo using ligands with greater affinity for this subtype. NSCLCs can express SSTR subtypes, which may interfere with SSTR 2 -based reporters. We assessed whether a SSTR 2 -based reporter can serve as a reporter of gene transfer into NSCLCs. SSTR subtype expression was assessed in NSCLC cell lines A 549, H 460, and H 1299 using RT-PCR. After infection with an adenovirus containing hemagglutinin-A-tagged-SSTR 2 (Ad-HA-SSTR 2) or <b>control</b> <b>insert,</b> expression was assessed by immunologic techniques and binding to clinically-approved 111 In-octreotide. In vivo, after magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, intrathoracic H 460 tumors were injected with Ad-HA-SSTR 2 or control virus (n[*]=[*] 6 mice/group) under ultrasound guidance. Intravenous injection of 111 In-octreotide 2 days later was followed by planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Biodistribution into tumors was assessed in vivo using anatomic MR and functional gamma-camera images and ex vivo using excised organs/tumors. In human lung tumor samples (n[*]=[*] 70), SSTR 2 expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry. All three NSCLC cell lines expressed different SSTR subtypes, but none expressed SSTR 2. Upon Ad-HA-SSTR 2 infection, HA-SSTR 2 expression was seen in all three cell lines using antibodies targeting the HA domain or 111 In-octreotide targeting the receptor domain (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Intrathoracic tumors infected with Ad-HA-SSTR 2 were clearly visible by gamma-camera imaging; expression was quantified by both in vivo and ex vivo biodistribution analysis and demonstrated greater uptake in tumors infected with Ad-HA-SSTR 2 compared with control virus (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Immunohistochemistry found that 78 % of NSCLCs are negative for and 13 % have low levels of SSTR 2 expression. It is concluded that SSTR 2 -based reporters can serve as reporters of gene transfer into NSCLCs...|$|E

This weakening of earlier hypotheses has been referred to as the Lojasiewicz refinement.

This paper generalizes the finite-dimensional approximation technique to a problem with state constraints, where the use of needle variations of the optimal control had not been successful. Moreover, the cost function and endpoint constraints are not assumed to be differentiable, but merely locally Lipschitz continuous.

Using this system {{it was found}} that treatment of PBMC with the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors theophylline (at 1 and 10 μg/ml) and RO- 20 - 1724 (at 1 μm) inhibited the migration of the lymphocyte component to 64. 2 ± 16. 4 %, 48. 9 ± 3. 0 % and 47. 5 ± 5. 8 % of the control values, respectively, while the migration of the monocytes component was largely unaffected. The PDE inhibitors needed to be present during the assay to inhibit migration, whereas pre-treatment of either the endothelium or the PBMC did not consistently effect lymphocyte migration. The drugs also inhibited the migration of lymphocytes through <b>control</b> <b>inserts,</b> either uncoated or coated with fibronectin, suggesting that some of the inhibition is an effect on lymphocyte motility rather than lymphocyte–endothelial interactions. Lymphocyte migration through fibronectin-coated filters was significantly enhanced compared with uncoated filters. Activation of the PBMC by anti-CD 3 MoAb increased motility and migration by up to 300 %. This migration appeared to be greatly inhibited by the PDE inhibitors, although the effect was complicated by problems of lymphocyte aggregation.
