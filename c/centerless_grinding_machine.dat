2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} a <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> using specially dressed {{grinding wheels}} matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread <b>grinding</b> and <b>centerless</b> thread <b>grinding.</b> Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the <b>centerless</b> thread <b>grinding</b> process is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding.</b> The blanks are hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common <b>centerless</b> thread <b>grinding</b> production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for a [...] long set screw.|$|R

It is shown that there is a critical lobe number, where the systems present an unstable behaviorthe critical lobe number is identified through the geometric stability index.

40|$|The work {{described}} {{investigates the}} lobing and chatter behavior, and approaches to suppress lobing and chatter {{in order to}} improve the workpiece roundness in <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding.</b> The problem of workpiece out-of-roundness {{is one of the main}} limitations for the applications of <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> as a high rate precision machining process. Lobing and/or chatter most often is the source of the problem. This work models the <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> process as a causal system between the potential grinding disturbances and the resulting workpiece out-of-roundness, and develops approaches to set up a <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> operation such that the workpiece out-of-roundness is kept minimum under the potential grinding disturbances. ^ A general <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> process model is proposed. The model can be simplified for lobing and chatter analysis. A Bidiagrammatical method is proposed to investigate the lobing stability. It was found that the upper and lower lobing growth rate can be estimated through the Bidiagrammatical method, and the lobing growth exhibits periodicity over the lobing frequency. A relative stability diagram is thus developed to provide guidance such that a proper setup angle β can be selected to suppress lobing. ^ During grinding, two types of workpiece surface waves can be generated: (1) standing wave; and (2) precessing wave. It was found that the standing waves are less stable, therefore, often cause significant workpiece out-of-roundness problem. A work-speed regulation method is proposed such that only precessing waves are generated during grinding, therefore, reduce the workpiece out-of-roundness. ^ Chatter stability is investigated by using a similar Bidiagrammatical method. It was found that chatter stability can be approximately assessed through lobing stability. Therefore, approaches to lobing suppression can be equally applied to suppress chatter. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> process {{demonstrates}} superior grinding accuracy with {{extremely high}} productivity, {{but only if}} the setup conditions are properly set up. Otherwise, various unfavorable phenomena manifest during the grinding processes and become serious obstacles to achieving that high quality and productivity. These phenomena are associated with the fundamental stabilities of the <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> system, so it is essential to keep the system stable by setting up the appropriate grinding conditions. This paper describes the development of a model for finding the setup conditions that simultaneously satisfy the three stability criteria of <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> systems: (1) work rotation stability for safe operations; (2) geometrical rounding stability for better roundness; and (3) dynamic system stability for chatter-free grinding. The objective of the model development is to produce combinations of optimal setup conditions as the outputs of the model, and to rank the priority of the outputs using PI (performance index) functions based on the process aims (productivity or accuracy). The paper demonstrates that the developed model, named Opt-Setup Master, can generate the optimum setup conditions to ensure safe operations, better roundness and chatter-free grinding. It provides practical setup conditions as well as scientific parameters and fundamental grinding parameters. Finally, the paper verifies that the Opt-Setup Master provides the setup conditions that simultaneously satisfy all three stability criteria of the <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> system...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to design an innovative vacuum-hydrostatic shoe to solve the workpiece lobing and shoe wear problems in <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> of bearing raceways so as to improve workpiece quality and dimensional accuracies and to reduce the machining cost. The shoe combines a vacuum pocket to a hydrostatic bearing, thus providing a non-contact, high stiffness and good load-carrying capacity workpiece support. Based on the kinematics and mechanics in shoe <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding,</b> the study provides theoretical analyses to systematically reveal the workpiece holding and rotating mechanisms of the planar frictional drivehead. It addresses workholding stability issue for the first time from the viewpoint of driving capacity and constraining capability which are the two contradictory sides of <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding.</b> Dynamic modeling is presented to correlate the lobing and chatter with machine setup parameters and process parameters in both time and frequency domains. A methodology is advanced for the design of vacuum-hydrostatic shoe. A computer model is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the vacuum-hydrostatic shoe in improving workpiece roundness through lobing control. Experimental results show that with the vacuum-hydrostatic shoe, the geometric and workholding instabilities are effectively eliminated or suppressed, which in turn improves workpiece geometric accuracies and surface finish. The shoe has made possible high speed, wear and thermal damage free workpiece support for shoe <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> due to its non-contact support mechanism. With the application of the vacuum-hydrostatic shoe, the shoe <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> process becomes insensitive to the critical parameters, such as offset and shoe setup angles.

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation method for investigating the form generation mechanism in the <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> process is described. In this work, instantaneous {{change of the}} apparent depth of cut during grinding was modeled using absolute coordinate systems. The result of the simulation was not affected by the coordinate system (the location of the reference circle center and the radius of the reference circle). Also, analytical models of the interference phenomena at the contact points were developed to investigate their effects on the roundness profile of a centerless ground workpiece. In order to {{study the effects of}} grinding variables on grinding mechanism, details of the machining factor were formulated using such process variables as grinding wheel speed, wheel specification, regulating wheel speed, dressing condition, etc. A least squares contact line was formulated to include the effect of workpiece orientation relative to the <b>grinding</b> <b>machine.</b> Using these formulas, 2 -D, 3 -D infeed, and 3 -D through-feed <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> simulation models were developed. For the 3 -D through-feed simulation model, grinding forces of previous and/or following workpieces were assumed {{as a function of the}} current workpiece location. ^ The experiments and {{computer simulation}}s were carried out using three types of cylindrical workpiece shapes with varying flat length. To validate these models, simulation results were compared with the experimental results. It was found that the number of lobes and the angular displacement of peaks and corresponding valleys of the simulation results were identical with those of the roundness profiles of ground workpieces. Through 2 -D simulation, it was verified that grinding wheel interference is affected not only by geometry but also by machine elasticity. 3 -D simulation results revealed that the effect of flat end is propagated to the opposite end through workpiece reorientation. It was shown that the inherent tapering error of the through-feed <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> exists.

50|$|<b>Centerless</b> <b>{{grinding}}</b> {{is a form}} of grinding {{where there}} is no collet or pair of centers holding the object in place. Instead, there is a regulating wheel positioned {{on the opposite side of}} the object to the grinding wheel. A work rest keeps the object at the appropriate height but has no bearing on its rotary speed. The workblade is angled slightly towards the regulating wheel, with the workpiece centerline above the centerlines of the regulating and grinding wheel; this means that high spots do not tend to generate corresponding opposite low spots, and hence the roundness of parts can be improved. <b>Centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> is much easier to combine with automatic loading procedures than centered grinding; throughfeed grinding, where the regulating wheel is held at a slight angle to the part so that there is a force feeding the part through the grinder, is particularly efficient.|$|R

This dissertation investigates the workpiece shape generating mechanism in the through-feed <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> process. Specifically, the workpiece lobing mechanism and axial guidance through the grinding gap were studied. ^ To study the workpiece lobing mechanism, a computer simulation of the plunge <b>centerless</b> <b>grinding</b> process was developed. This simulation was experimentally verified {{by comparing the}} harmonic spectra of simulated workpieces with the spectra of workpieces ground with similar set-up parameters. The simulation correctly predicted which frequencies on the workpiece surface were more susceptible to roundness errors than others. These results were found to also be compatible with a previous linear lobing model (ZHOU 94). The plunge lobing analysis was then extended to the through-feed case {{by means of an}} average growth rate chart. This chart characterizes the workpiece lobing stability for a given through-feed set-up. Again, experimental studies were conducted to verify the accuracy of this model and it was determined that the average growth rate chart was effective in assessing the workpiece lobing stability for the case of short workpieces like bearing rings. ^ To address the problem of controlling the workpiece cylindrical form, a simulation of the workpiece supporting system was developed. These results confirmed the accuracy of previous researcher 2 ̆ 7 s analytical estimates of the proper regulating wheel shape.
