2500|$|The {{other problem}} was that the Stangensteuerung never worked well with more than one gun.

Fokker's initial answer to this was the fitting of extra [...] "followers" [...] to the Stangensteuerung's large <b>cam</b> <b>wheel,</b> to (theoretically) produce the [...] "ripple" [...] salvo necessary to ensure that the guns were aimed at the same point on the propeller disc. This proved a disastrously unstable arrangement in the case of three guns, and was rather less than satisfactory even for two. Most of the early Fokker and Halberstadt biplane fighters were limited to a single gun for this reason.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanical {{efficiency}} was {{improved by}} reversing {{the action of}} the push rod.

50|$|Harnischfeger Corporation was {{established}} as P&H Mining in 1884 by Alonzo Pawling and Henry Harnischfeger. In 1914, P&H introduced the world's first gasoline engine powered dragline. In 1988, Page {{was acquired by}} Harnischfeger which makes the P&H line of shovels, draglines, and cranes. P&H's largest dragline is the 9030C with a 160-yard bucket and up to a 425-foot boom.In 1907, Monighan's Machine Works of Chicago became interested in manufacturing draglines when local contractor John W. Page placed an order for hoisting machinery to install one. In 1908, Monighan {{changed its name to}} the Monighan Machine Company. In 1913, a Monighan engineer named Oscar Martinson invented the first walking mechanism for a dragline. The device, known as the Martinson Tractor, was installed on a Monighan dragline, creating the first walking dragline. This gave Monighan a significant advantage over other draglines and the company prospered. The cam mechanism was further improved in 1925 by eliminating the drag chains for the shoes and changing to a <b>cam</b> <b>wheel</b> running in an oval track. This gave the shoe a proper elliptical motion. The first dragline using the new mechanism was the 3-W available in 1926. So popular were these machines that the name Monighan became a generic term for dragline. In the early 1930s, Bucyrus-Erie began purchasing shares of Monighan stock with Monighan's approval. Bucyrus purchased a controlling interest and the joint company became known as Bucyrus-Monighan until the formal merger in 1946.|$|E
5000|$|Near {{the end of}} May 1915, {{while it}} was based at Douai with Feldflieger Abteilung 62, the Fokker factory {{outfitted}} Parschau's aircraft with the first trial version of the Fokker Stangensteuerung synchronizer and a Parabellum MG14 light machine gun, leaving the wing panels in the stock A.III airframe's [...] "shoulder-winged" [...] location while armed and in Parschau's use in May and June 1915. Parschau made several attempts at aerial combat during June 1915, but at this stage the gear proved very unreliable, the Parabellum gun repeatedly jamming in action. As no photos exist verifying any change in wing-panel anchorage location for Parschau's A.16/15 aircraft before its return to the Fokker factory a second time {{to serve as the}} [...] "prototype" [...] Eindecker airframe, the belief that it had been modified to have the standard mid-fuselage location used on the later production E.I airframes before its second return to the Fokker factory has not yet been proven, as it was lowered some time after the Fokker factory had received it back to be retained there, following Parschau's final use of it. The mid-fuselage wing mount modification was not fitted to the initial batch of five M.5K/MG production prototypes as originally built, with Otto Parschau's second Eindecker, the first M.5K/MG built bearing IdFlieg serial E.1/15 uniquely getting it sometime while in service. Production E.Is, and all further Fokker Eindeckers, were also fitted with the definitive version of the Stangensteuerung gear, with a large <b>cam</b> <b>wheel</b> replacing the early drive taken from the oil pump drive shaft.|$|E
5000|$|Firstly, {{a method}} of {{determining}} {{the position of the}} propeller at a given instant was required. Typically, a cam, driven either directly from the propeller shaft itself, or from some part of the motor revolving at the same speed as the propeller, generated a series of impulses {{at the same rate as}} the propeller's revolutions. There were exceptions to this, some gears placed the cam within the gun trigger mechanism itself, and the firing impulses were sometimes timed to occur at every two, or three revolutions of the propeller, or, especially in the case of hydraulic or electric gears, at the rate of two or more for each revolution. The diagrams in this section assume, for simplicity's sake, one impulse for one revolution, so that all synchronized rounds are [...] "aimed" [...] at a single spot on the propeller disc.The actual timing of these impulses had to be adjusted to coincide with a [...] "safe" [...] period, when the blades of the propeller were well out of the way, and this adjustment had to be checked at intervals, especially if the propeller was changed or refitted, as well as after a major engine overhaul.

40|$|International audienceBearings, {{friction}} <b>wheels,</b> <b>cams</b> etc. {{are widely}} employed elements in machine construction. The modeling {{of the dynamics}} of rolling friction plays therefore {{a crucial role in the}} simulation and optimization of such systems. This paper describes a recently developed transient-rolling-friction model with its application to different generic dynamical systems, to simulate the effects of rolling friction or traction on the dynamics of mechanical systems. The results, which are expressed in terms of the complex stiffness arising in the rolling-contact patches, show that the behavior depends on both the amplitude and the frequency of oscillation. For low amplitudes and frequencies, the behavior is quasi linear. For increasing amplitudes and frequencies, however, strong nonlinearities appear, leading to complex behavior...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the most}} common configuration, there is a <b>cam</b> or <b>wheel</b> {{at the end of}} each limb. The shape of the cam may vary {{somewhat}} between different bow designs. There are several different concepts of using the cams to store energy in the limbs, and these all fall under a category called bow eccentrics. The four most common types of bow eccentrics are Single Cam, Hybrid Cam, Dual Cam and Binary Cam. However, there are also other less common designs, like the Quad Cam and Hinged. Cams are often described using their [...] "let-off" [...] rating. As a cam is rotated, the force required to hold the bow in position reaches a peak and then decreases as the bow approaches maximum extension (a position known as [...] "the wall"). The percent-difference between the maximum force encountered during the draw and the force required to hold the bow in full extension is the [...] "let-off". This value is commonly between 65% and 80% of the peak weight for recently designed compound bows, although some older compound bows provided a let-off of only 50% and some recent designs achieve let-offs in excess of 90%.|$|R
50|$|A set of five sheets, one {{for each}} of the chi wheels, was also prepared. These {{contained}} a set of columns corresponding in number to the cams for the appropriate chi wheel, and were referred to as a 'cage'. So the 3 cage had 29 such columns. Successive 'guesses' of Δ values then produced further putative cam state values. These might either agree or disagree with previous assumptions, and a count of agreements and disagreements was made on these sheets. Where disagreements substantially outweighed agreements, the assumption was made that the Δ character was not the null character '/', so the relevant assumption was discounted. Progressively, all the cam settings of the chi wheels were deduced, and from them, the psi and motor <b>wheel</b> <b>cam</b> settings.|$|R
50|$|Compound bows are {{designed}} to reduce the force required to hold the string at full draw, hence allowing the archer more time to aim with less muscular stress. Most compound designs use <b>cams</b> or elliptical <b>wheels</b> {{on the ends of}} the limbs to achieve this. A typical let-off is anywhere from 65% to 80%. For example, a 60-pound bow with 80% let-off only requires 12 pounds of force to hold at full draw. Up to 99% let-off is possible. The compound bow was invented by Holless Wilbur Allen in the 1960s (a US patent was filed in 1966 and granted in 1969) and it has become the most widely used type of bow for all forms of archery in North America.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} <b>cams</b> on each <b>wheel</b> equalled {{the number of}} impulses needed to cause them to {{complete}} a full rotation. These numbers are all co-prime with each other, giving the longest possible time before the pattern repeated. This number {{is the product of}} the number of positions of the wheels i.e. 43 × 47 × 51 × 53 × 59 × 37 × 61 × 41 × 31 × 29 × 26 × 23 = 1.6034 × 1019 (16 billion billion). However, if the five impulses are considered independently, the numbers are much more manageable. The product of the rotation period of any pair of χ wheels gives numbers between 41 × 31 = 1271 and 26 × 23 = 598.|$|R
50|$|The {{total number}} of cams on the twelve wheels of the SZ {{machines}} was 501. Each cam could either be in a raised position, in which case it contributed x to {{the logic of the}} system, or in the lowered position, in which case it generated •. The total possible number of patterns of raised cams was 2501 which is an astronomically large number. In practice, however, about half of the <b>cams</b> on each <b>wheel</b> were in the raised position. Later, the Germans realized that if the number of raised cams was not very close to half there would be runs of xs and •s, a cryptographic weakness. Indeed, this weakness was one of the two factors that led to the system being diagnosed.|$|R
50|$|As well as {{applying}} differencing to {{the full}} 5-bit characters of the ITA2 code, Tutte applied it to the individual impulses (bits). The current chi <b>wheel</b> <b>cam</b> settings needed to have been established to allow the relevant sequence of characters of the chi wheels to be generated. It was totally impracticable to generate the 22 million characters from all five of the chi wheels, so it was initially limited to 41 × 31 = 1271 from the first two. After explaining his findings to Max Newman, Newman was given the job of developing an automated approach to comparing ciphertext and key to look for departures from randomness. The first machine was dubbed Heath Robinson, but the much faster Colossus computer, developed by Tommy Flowers and using algorithms written by Tutte and his colleagues, soon took over for breaking codes.|$|R

That is the second purpose of a sliding pan cover: were the pyrites to engage a stationary wheel, it would almost certainly jam the mechanism: but the built-in delay allows the pyrites to slip off the sliding pan-cover on to an already rotating wheel.
