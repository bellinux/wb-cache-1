While most academics have used [...] "The Wire" [...] as a <b>cultural</b> <b>object</b> or case study, Benjamin Leclair-Paquet has instead argued that the [...] "creative methods behind HBO's The Wire evoke original ways to experiment with speculative work that reveal the merit of the imaginary as a pragmatic research device."
