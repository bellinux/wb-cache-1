5|$|Promoted to {{temporary}} flight lieutenant on 1 August 1943, McAloney {{was sent}} to the Directorate of Technical Services from November as the specialist officer on American and gas turbine jet engines. The following November, he was dispatched to Dutch New Guinea to rectify issues being experienced with Pratt & Whitney engines in operations by aircraft of the 1st Tactical Air Force. He returned to Australia and his position with Technical Services in December, and saw out the remainder of the war in this post. McAloney decided he wanted to remain in the Air Force on the cessation of hostilities, and subsequently sought a permanent commission in the post-war RAAF. Having continued on a short-service commission in the meantime, his application was ultimately approved in September 1948 and he was granted the substantive rank of flight lieutenant. His younger brother, Robert Simpson McAloney, also saw service with the RAAF in the Second World War. He had enlisted in late 1937 and rose to the rank of warrant officer before his discharge in 1946, his final posting being to No.1 <b>Communication</b> <b>Unit.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1950, No. 38 Squadron was {{selected}} to form part of the Australian force assigned to the Commonwealth Far East Air Force. As an element of this force, the Australian Government agreed for the unit to be tasked with courier flights across Asia and providing support for the British-led counterinsurgency operations in Malaya. The squadron's advance party arrived at RAF Changi in Singapore on 19 June 1950, {{and all of its}} personnel and eight Dakotas were operational there by 6 July. While in Malaya the squadron came under the command of No. 90 (Composite) Wing, along with the Avro Lincoln-equipped No. 1 Squadron. Half the squadron's aircrew were veterans of the Berlin Airlift, but none had any direct experience of tropical environments. No. 38 Squadron began flying transport missions in Malaya in early July, with British and New Zealand pilots accompanying its aircrews during {{the first two weeks of}} operations to help them become familiar with local conditions. From July 1950 until February 1951, No. 38 Squadron's main task was to conduct courier flights to Borneo, Ceylon, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines, and these remained an important responsibility throughout the period it was based at Singapore. Following the outbreak of the Korean War, the squadron flew British troops and supplies from Singapore to Japan and Korea, and four of No. 38 Squadron's Dakotas were transferred to No. 30 <b>Communication</b> <b>Unit</b> in Japan during November 1950.|$|E

25|$|Military {{swarming}} is {{a behaviour}} where autonomous or partially autonomous units of action attack an enemy from several different directions and then regroup.

Military swarming involves the use of a decentralized force against an opponent, in a manner that emphasizes mobility, <b>communication,</b> <b>unit</b> autonomy and coordination or synchronization.

25|$|Military {{swarming}} {{is often}} encountered in asymmetric warfare where opposing forces {{are not of}} the same size, or capacity.

Historically military forces have used the principles of swarming without really examining them explicitly, but there is now active research in consciously examining military doctrines that draw ideas from swarming.

500|$|After {{returning}} to Richmond, No. 38 Squadron was mainly tasked with routine transport duties. The squadron also occasionally provided aircraft for CSIRO rainmaking experiments. During the 1950s and early 1960s, No. 38 Squadron {{developed a reputation}} as a [...] "cowboy" [...] unit with lax flying standards. The squadron did not conduct proper conversion courses, and new Dakota pilots received only ad-hoc instruction on the type while serving as the co-pilot during operational tasks. On 8 March 1953, No. 38 Squadron absorbed No. 36 Squadron's Dakotas, after which No. 30 Transport Unit (previously No. 30 <b>Communication</b> <b>Unit)</b> in Japan was renamed No. 36 Squadron. From late March until September 1954, No. 38 Squadron conducted VIP flights out of RAAF Station Canberra. In November that year, it was renamed the Transport Training Squadron and became responsible for instructing new Dakota crews and RAAF air movements personnel. It resumed its previous name on 13 June 1963.|$|E
500|$|No. 84 (Army Cooperation) Wing {{was formed}} on 11September 1944 in Cairns, Queensland.

The wing arrived at Torokina in October to begin supporting Australian troops during the Bougainville Campaign. No.5 Squadron, equipped with eighteen CAC Boomerangs and four CAC Wirraways, {{was assigned to}} mark targets for F4U Corsairs of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. The Austers of No.17 AOP Flight were used for reconnaissance and courier work, becoming, {{in the words of}} the official history, [...] "the eyes of the battalion commanders". No.10 Communications Unit flew Avro Ansons and Bristol Beauforts on courier, reconnaissance, supply, and anti-malarial spraying missions; it was renamed No.10 Local Air Supply Unit in March 1945. Between December 1944 and January 1945, the wing lost one Auster, one Wirraway, and one Boomerang on operations.|$|E

500|$|After the war, No.1 AD was {{responsible}} for introducing the first jets into RAAF service. A Gloster Meteor made its first flight in Australia from Laverton in 1946. By May 1947, No.1 AD had assembled the first de Havilland Vampire jet in Australia for its maiden flight. In October the same year, the first helicopter in RAAF service, a Sikorsky S-51, arrived at the depot. That month, No.1 AD also completed fitting out a Douglas Dakota with an office, a lounge suite, [...] and a kitchenette for service as the Governor-General's VIP transport, operated out of Laverton by No.1 <b>Communication</b> <b>Unit.</b> In 1950, the depot received the sole high-performance piston-engined CAC CA-15 to be built, which {{had been sent to}} be [...] "converted to components" [...] (scrapped). No.1 AD took delivery of the first Australian-built English Electric Canberra jet bomber in July 1953. Shortly afterwards, it modified the three Canberras of No.1 Long Range Flight prior to the unit taking part in the 1953 London-to-Christchurch air race. In September that year, the first Australian-built Sabre jet fighter was delivered.|$|E
500|$|In May 1944, Hely assumed {{command of}} No.72 Wing at Merauke, Dutch New Guinea, {{succeeding}} Group Captain Allan Walters. Comprising fighter and dive-bomber squadrons, the wing {{had been established}} to undertake air defence and patrol tasks in and around western New Guinea. Hely departed Merauke in September 1944 to establish an army cooperation formation, No.84 Wing, in Cairns, Queensland. It {{was one of two}} such wings formed by the RAAF in the South West Pacific Theatre late in World WarII. They were, as described by the official history of the RAAF in the Pacific, [...] "essentially non-offensive in character", responsible for reconnaissance, artillery spotting, supply drops to ground forces, spraying DDT to combat malaria, and guiding close support aircraft to their objectives. The wing could also carry out its own strikes on [...] "targets of opportunity". No. 84 Wing comprised No.5 (Tactical Reconnaissance) Squadron, No.17 Air Observation Post Flight, No.10 <b>Communication</b> <b>Unit</b> (subsequently renamed No.10 Local Air Supply Unit), and No.39 Operational Base Unit. It deployed to Torokina in October to support Australian troops during the Bougainville Campaign. No.5 Squadron, equipped with CAC Boomerangs and [...] Wirraways, was assigned to mark targets for F4U Corsairs of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. [...] Between December 1944 and January 1945, the wing lost one Auster, one Wirraway, and one Boomerang on operations. Despite shortages of pilots and equipment, Hely's formation was generally able {{to keep pace with the}} army's requirements. By the end of June 1945, it had flown over 4,000 sorties.|$|E
