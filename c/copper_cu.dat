2500|$|The sodium {{carbonate}} test (not {{to be confused}} with {{sodium carbonate}} extract test) is used to distinguish between some common metal ions, which are precipitated as their respective carbonates. The test can distinguish between <b>copper</b> (<b>Cu),</b> iron (Fe), and calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn) or lead (Pb). Sodium carbonate solution is added to the salt of the metal. A blue precipitate indicates Cu2+ ion. A dirty green precipitate indicates Fe2+ ion. A yellow-brown precipitate indicates Fe3+ ion. A white precipitate indicates Ca2+, Zn2+, or Pb2+ ion. [...] The compounds formed are, respectively, copper(II) carbonate, iron(II) carbonate, iron(III) oxide, calcium carbonate, zinc carbonate, and lead(II) carbonate. This test is used to precipitate the ion present as almost all carbonates are insoluble. While this test is useful for telling these cations apart, it fails if other ions are present, because most metal carbonates are insoluble and will precipitate. In addition, calcium, zinc, and lead ions all produce white precipitates with carbonate, making it difficult to distinguish between them. Instead of sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide may be added, this gives nearly the same colours, except that lead and zinc hydroxides are soluble in excess alkali, and can hence be distinguished from calcium.

Their corrosion properties with CG Cu as a control have been studied in simulated uterine fluid (SUF) under different conditions using electrochemical measurement methods. Long-term immersion of UFG Cu, SC Cu and CG Cu samples in SUF at 37 °C have been studied for 300 days. A lower copper ion burst release and a higher efficiency release of cupric ions were observed for UFG Cu and SC Cu compared with CG Cu {{in the first month}} of immersion and 2 months later. The respective corrosion mechanisms for UFG Cu, SC Cu and CG Cu in SUF are proposed. In vitro biocompatibility tests show a better cellular response to UFG Cu and SC Cu than CG Cu. In terms of instantaneous corrosion behavior, long-term corrosion performance and in vitro biocompatibility, the three pure copper materials follow the order: UFG Cu > SC Cu > CG Cu, which indicates that UFG Cu could be the most suitable candidate material for intrauterine devices. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Two {{incidents}} {{concerning the}} contamination of copper-conductor surfaces associated with uninterruptible power systems (UPS) were recently observed. Valve-regulated lead/acid (VRLA) batteries {{used in the}} UPSs for backup powering were diagnosed as a possible source of the contamination. One of the VRLA batteries from the UPS unit was subjected to overcharge in the laboratory, to simulate the incident. Overcharge currents greater than 10 A, coupled with battery temperatures over 60 degrees C, can cause a VRLA battery to release significant amounts of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide. Under extreme conditions, hazardous levels of hydrogen sulfide could be generated. We conclude that the contamination was due to <b>copper</b> sulfide, <b>Cu</b> 2 S, and <b>copper</b> oxide, <b>Cu</b> 2 O, formed on copper surfaces {{as a consequence of}} hydrogen sulfide evolution and the high humidity inside the UPS enclosure resulting from battery venting...|$|R
