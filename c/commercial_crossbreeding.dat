5000|$|The Chester White is a {{versatile}} breed suited to both intensive and extensive husbandry. Though not {{as popular as}} the Duroc, Yorkshire, or Hampshire, the Chester White is actively used in <b>commercial</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> operations for pork. [...] The Chester White is the most durable of the white breeds; it can gain as much as 1.36 lb a day and gain 1 lb for every 3 lb of grain it is fed. Their pale color leaves Chester Whites prone to sunburn; they must be given access to shade in the summer.|$|E

30|$|The {{installation}} of automated animal feeding systems {{is expected to}} improve animal feed quality and lead {{to a reduction in}} feeding costs, while improving labor efficiency and animal management (Aggelopoulos et al. 2015). The decrease in the feeding costs can be achieved through the elaboration of a balanced and economic feeding system that will be based on the animals’ needs. Such needs are linked to the genetic breeding material and farm conditions, the nutritional content of the animal feed and the sound facilities for mixing, feeding and storing animal feed (Aggelopoulos et al. 2009). A reduction in animal feed expenses could also be reached by increasing production of {{at least part of the}} animal feed required by the farm (Milán et al. 2014). As regards the use of genetic material, it is deemed essential for farms to use the correct system in renewing their existing genetic material or in <b>commercial</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> with suitable domestic breeds, so that the relevant economic results are improved (Aggelopoulos et al. 2014). It is a fact that Greece lacks the relevant organizational structures and therefore, integrated genetic improvement programs do not exist. Consequently, producers face grave difficulties in acquiring the animals they need for reproduction, particularly female animals, at affordable prices. The planning and financing of an effective genetic improvement plan for sheep and goat farming in Greece will be a decisive step towards satisfying the producers’ need to secure the right animals for reproduction in a timely and economically beneficial manner. This can be realized through the use of suitable genetic material, with the right focus and in correlation with the local conditions for the production and trade of the products (Pavloudi et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundThe {{development}} of a reliable method to predict heterosis would greatly improve the efficiency of <b>commercial</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> schemes. Extending heterosis prediction from the line level to the individual sire level would take advantage of variation between sires from the same pure line, and further increase the use of heterosis in crossbreeding schemes. We aimed at deriving the theoretical expectation for heterosis due to dominance in the crossbred offspring of individual sires, and investigating how much extra variance in heterosis {{can be explained by}} predicting heterosis at the individual sire level rather than at the line level. We used 53 421 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotypes of 3427 White Leghorn sires, allele frequencies of six White Leghorn dam-lines and cage-based records on egg number and egg weight of ~ 210 000 crossbred hens. ResultsWe derived the expected heterosis for the offspring of individual sires as the between- and within-line genome-wide heterozygosity excess in the offspring of a sire relative to the mean heterozygosity of the pure lines. Next, we predicted heterosis by regressing offspring performance on the heterozygosity excess. Predicted heterosis ranged from 7. 6 to 16. 7 for egg number, and from 1. 1 to 2. 3 grams for egg weight. Between-line differences accounted for 99. 0 % of the total variance in predicted heterosis, while within-line differences among sires accounted for 0. 7 %. ConclusionsWe show {{that it is possible to}} predict heterosis at the sire level, thus to distinguish between sires within the same pure line with offspring that show different levels of heterosis. However, based on our data, variation in genome-wide predicted heterosis between sires from the same pure line was small; most differences were observed between lines. We hypothesise that this method may work better if predictions are based on SNPs with identified dominance effects...|$|E
