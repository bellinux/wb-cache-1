50|$|Emulsions {{can be used}} {{to create}} core shell or {{composite}} fibers without modification of the spinneret. However, these fibers are usually more difficult to produce as compared to <b>coaxial</b> <b>spinning</b> due to the greater number of variables which must be accounted for in creating the emulsion. A water phase and an immiscible solvent phase are mixed in the presence of an emulsifying agent to form the emulsion. Any agent which stabilizes the interface between the immiscible phases can be used. Surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton and nanoparticles have been used successfully. During the electrospinning process the emulsion droplets within the fluid are stretched and gradually confined leading to their coalescence. If the volume fraction of inner fluid is sufficiently high, a continuous inner core can be formed.|$|E
30|$|Biphasic drug release {{profiles}} {{have drawn}} considerable attention in pharmaceutics {{for a number}} of reasons - one possible application is the ‘burst’ release of a loading dose of drug followed by sustained release over a prolonged period of time to maintain the systemic drug concentration within the therapeutic window [21 – 23]. A wide variety of technologies have been exploited to generate drug delivery systems with biphasic release profiles. Electrospinning can achieve this objective through strategies such as preparing multi-layered nanofiber mats or producing nanofibers containing nanoparticles [21, 24]. Core-shell nanofibers generated using coaxial electrospinning have also been reported to offer biphasic release, with a fast-dissolving shell delivering immediate release followed by sustained release from the core [22]. Generally, both the core and shell fluids used for <b>coaxial</b> <b>spinning</b> have been electrospinnable in such studies [23].|$|E
30|$|Formation of nanofibers using block {{copolymers}} under cylindrical confinement {{has been}} reported as well. The two-fluid <b>coaxial</b> <b>spinning</b> technique was used to encapsulate the desired block copolymer as the core with another protective polymer as the shell. Advantages of the two-fluid electrospinning include (a) The shell fluid itself being electro-spinnable serves as a process aid for the block copolymers. Removal of these shells, results in ultrafine block copolymer fibers, (b) smaller diameter fibers are produced due to the independent control of the two fluids that permit wider changes in {{the diameter of the}} core fiber, (c) the integrity of the fiber does not get compromised due to the cylindrical confinement of the shell polymer which has a higher glass or melt transition temperature, thus creating a temperature window. TEM images confirm the continuous core–shell nature of the nanofibers. It also shows well-defined structures consisting of concentric layers because of curving of the lamellar phase due to fiber confinement [73].|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of rodlike cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) suggest great potential as bioderived reinforcement in (nano) composites.

30|$|Neat, morphology-defined, graphene-based {{hollow fibers}} were {{fabricated}} via a <b>coaxial</b> two-capillary <b>spinning</b> strategy [55]. The coaxial two-capillary spinneret was fabricated by inserting {{a stainless steel}} needle (connected to a syringe-containing coagulation bath) into a branched glass tube (filled with GO suspension) with a capillary tip. Figure  11 f shows a schematic illustration of the apparatus for spinning with the coagulation bath of methanol solution containing 3  M KCl. The semitransparent graphene oxide hollow fibers (GO-HFs) (Fig.  11 g) were continuously produced, and the hollow structure was reflected by the open tip (Fig.  11 g, inset) and SEM observation (Fig.  11 h). After being naturally dried, the GO-HFs were converted to black color (Fig.  11 i). Replacing the inner fluid of KCl/methanol solution with compressed air, the obtained GO-HFs displayed a necklace-like structure (Fig.  11 j).|$|R
30|$|As we all know, the {{solution}} parameters of co-spinning include {{the solution}} viscosity, solvent vapor pressure, interfacial tension, and solution conductivity. As shown in Fig.  2, when {{we change the}} solvent THF with acetone in TPU, the fiber adhesion phenomenon is reduced. It {{should be noted that}} the solvents used by different kinds of TPU are very important. The solution properties are shown in Table  1. As been shown, the solvents of TPU 1 are DMAc and THF (3 / 1 volume ratio), while the solvents of TPU 2 are DMAc and acetone (3 / 1 volume ratio), which result to the different solution properties. As we can see, the surface tension of TPU 1 is about 34.45  N m−[*] 1, while the TPU 2 is about 25.34  N m−[*] 1, which is much bigger than the TPU 2. The surface tension of THF is 28.8  dyne/cm and the vapor pressure is about 18.9 (20  °C), while the surface tension of acetone is 18.8  dyne/cm and the vapor pressure is about 24.64 (20  °C). If the solution vapor pressure is too high, then the solvent will evaporate too quickly and the solution will not be able to make a Taylor cone, while if it is too low, then the fibers will reach the collection plate wet and will merge to form a film. In <b>coaxial</b> <b>spinning,</b> it is usually advantageous to use solvents (or solvent mixtures) with different vapor pressures to avoid fiber collapse [19].|$|E
40|$|TiO 2 and MgO were {{investigated}} as self-decontaminating catalysts on a fibrous substrate. A photo-oxidation mechanism with UV energy resulting in strong oxidation by TiO 2 was demonstrated by degradation of a carbamate pesticide. In contrast, MgO functioned through surface destructive adsorption and thus {{did not require}} exposure to UV radiation for self-decontamination to occur. Regarding {{to the effect of}} fiber morphology, two types of morphology were studied: Core/sheath fiber and continuous porous fiber structure were formed in electrospinning. In the core/sheath approach by <b>coaxial</b> <b>spinning,</b> a higher density of nanoparticle distribution in the surface region was observed when compared with the uniaxial approach, which means the probability of interaction between TiO 2 and toxin increased. The core/sheath structure with a higher particle concentration in the sheath provided more rapid initial degradation of toxin and the photocatalytic reaction of core/sheath morphology showed second-order behavior. It was also observed that the fibers containing higher content of TiO 2 degraded more pesticide for both uniaxial and coaxial fibers. Aside from the selective location of nanoparticles to the fiber surface, interconnected porous morphology was studied. With varying the ratio of solvents, different morphologies were observed in electrospun fibers. A polymer solution consisting of An/Ac 60 / 40 and 15 wt % of CA/PEO 60 / 40 (80 / 20 in moles) enabled the highest degree of continuity (0. 77) of PEO phase in CA matrix during the electrospinning. The interconnected intra-fiber pores (89 nm width) and large surface area (21. 8 m 2 /g) were observed at the electrospun fiber fabricated with the above composition. A catalyst incorporated substrate of the nanochanneled fiber contained MgO was investigated as a methyl parathion removal membrane. In both a soaking test and a membrane filtration, the MgO loaded highly channeled fiber was observed to remove more amount of MP, which resulted from the physical adsorption and destructive adsorption. MP was suggested to be adsorbed and removed from solutions by the exposed MgO particles in fiber and the adsorption to porous fiber. The advantage of the channeled morphology over the conventional regular surface in fiber was showed up in a membrane filtration process. SEM, DSC, TGA, XRD, a BET instrument, and HPLC were used to confirm the morphology, chemistry, and removal performance...|$|E
