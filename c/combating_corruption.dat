[...] He said that [...] "It is not permissible {{and is considered}} betrayal and assistance to the enemies of Islam." [...] Also, [...] "A believer has to help keeping security, that of his nation and community, and protecting his religion." [...] This fatwa is vague and itself {{is in need of}} another explanatory fatwa. Foreign media appears to have been singled out because it is mostly free and does not conform to Saudi Arabian government censorship. The fatwa uses the extremely strong terms (i.e., [...] "haram" [...] or unlawful, [...] "treason," [...] "betrayal," [...] and [...] "major crime") for the simple act of contacting the press. This fatwa has the potential to endanger the lives of ordinary citizens and members of the media due to the connotation of its language and overall ambiguity. It also threatens the financial interests of legitimate global business.
