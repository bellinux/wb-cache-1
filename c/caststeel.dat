40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} the influence of loading history and the processes of materialdegradation on the initiation of cracking and on durability under creep and fatigue conditions. Design/methodology/approach: The aim of the research was to identify the properties of the material of thefittings cut out of a start-up pipeline connecting two OP- 140 boilers with turbines, as well as to identify thereasons of failure of these parts after 100000 hours of operation. Results of the investigations were the basisof predicting the lifetime of machine parts and components of devices subjected to complex mechanical andthermal influence. Numerical simulation of work conditions was also performed. Problem of life assessment ofthe pipelines is currently the object of interest of many research centers. Findings: Due to extreme conditions of the start-up pipeline operation, its T-connections are subject to quickwear, and their properties determine the operational reliability and safety of the whole pipeline. For the reasonit is necessary to verify the criteria of pipelines’ durability evaluation applied so far, based on the parameterscharacteristic of the creep process exclusively. Research limitations/implications: In the case discussed, i. e. a T-connection being a start-up pipeline part, thepresent criteria should be expanded with critical values describing fatigue/corrosion processes. Practical implications: The paper introduces the results of investigations of the 0. 2 C- 1. 2 Cr- 0. 6 Mo- 0. 3 V <b>caststeel</b> used for parts of live steam pipelines working in power plants. Such parts include, e. g. T-connections. Originality/value: The paper show the possibilities of numerical models application...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{effectiveness}} and usefulness of the quench ageing on theservice properties of massive duplex cast steel. The mechanism of precipitation of a ε-Cu phase and its effect onthe mechanical properties of the cast steel were investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The ferrite substructure was examined on a JOEL JEM HREM. The analysisof chemical composition of selected micro-regions was carried out using a scanning electron microscope. Theverification of the metallographic examination results was done using the Thermo-Calc program. Findings: Quench ageing causes an increase in hardness and drop in impact resistance, which results from theformation of the ε-Cu phase. The ageing parameters have a substantial influence on the ferrite substructure and thedegree of coherence, dispersion and amount of the ε-Cu phase. The ageing treatment at 480 ˚C causes, in additionto the precipitation of the ε-Cu phase coherent with the matrix, the formation of a α’-Cr phase and an α-Fe phase. Practical implications: Duplex cast steels are becoming an irreplaceable material in the elements of equipmentexposed to the simultaneous action of corrosive and erosive environment. In the case of massive elements, suchas pump (rotors and guide vanes) and pipeline elements etc., which are operated in corrosive environments ofwater suspensions of solids of different type and gradation, the effect of ageing will be much lower than in smalllaboratory specimens, which is associated with the presence of a large amount of the incoherent ε-Cu phase inthe cast steel after the solution heat treatment. Originality/value: The lower limit of ageing temperature (480 ˚C) coincide with the temperature of anundesirable spinodal decomposition of the ferrite, which is partially responsible for the slight increase inhardness and a drop in plastic properties. This is the indication that the lower temperature of ageing duplex <b>caststeels</b> with copper should not be lower than 500 ˚C...|$|R
