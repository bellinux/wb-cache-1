50|$|Download is a Canadian {{electronic}} music group formed by Dwayne Goettel and cEvin Key of Skinny Puppy in 1994. The initial lineup also included Off & Gone's Phil Western and Mark Spybey of Dead Voices on Air, but {{has since been}} particularly fluid, with Key and Western being the only constant members following Goettel's death. Download's music {{has been described as}} post-industrial, drawing from the band's genesis as part of Skinny Puppy but also sharing common stylistic ground with such artists as Aphex Twin and Autechre. The primary instrumentation common throughout their albums is a blend of synthesizers and sampled instruments; the music is particularly <b>centered</b> on elements <b>of</b> <b>percussion</b> and rhythm.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the term}} partido alto {{originally}} arose {{at the beginning}} of the 1900s to describe instrumental music, the term came to be used to signify a type of samba which is characterized by a highly percussive beat of pandeiro, using the palm of the hand in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the instrument in place.

50|$|The {{sweet spot}} on a {{baseball}} bat is generally defined as {{the point at which}} the impact feels best to the batter. The <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>percussion</b> defines a place where, if the bat strikes the ball and the batter's hands are at the pivot point, the batter feels no sudden reactive force. However, since a bat is not a rigid object the vibrations produced by the impact also play a role. Also, the pivot point of the swing may not be at the place where the batter's hands are placed. Research has shown that the dominant physical mechanism in determining where the sweet spot is arises from the location of nodes in the vibrational modes of the bat, not the location of the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>percussion.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Yanmaodao (...) {{is a type}} of dao used as a {{standard}} military weapon during the Ming Dynasty and middle Qing Dynasty (1368-1800). The blade is straight until the curve begins around the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>percussion</b> along the last 1/4 or so of the blade approaching the tip. The <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>percussion</b> is the point on the blade with the least vibration on hard contact, the spot on the blade that transmits the most power to the target in a hard chop. This allows for thrusting attacks and overall handling {{similar to that of the}} jian, while still preserving much of the dao's strengths in cutting and slashing. This type of sword seems to have lost its popularity with military and martial arts practitioners alike by the end of the 18th century.|$|E

50|$|The sword {{consists}} of a very thin, rounded blade with a large ricasso and a heavy hilt and pommel.

This odd construction also has the effect of moving the sword's <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>percussion</b> to a theoretical point beyond its tip.

All adult bats are sold as -3 weight drop. The most common bat is the CF series and the Vodoo series. This bat started as the F2.Other innovations include aluminum-carbon hybrid bats. The company is unlike many of its competitors, who produce bats abroad.More than 150 college baseball programs use Demarini bats, including Oregon State University, the repeat College World Series Champions in 2006 and 2007, and 2009 CWS champion Louisiana State University.

5000|$|Imagine a rigid beam {{suspended}} from a wire by a fixture that can slide freely along the wire at point P, {{as shown in}} the Figure. An impulsive blow is applied from the left. If it is below the center of mass (CM) it will cause the beam to rotate counterclockwise around the CM and also cause the CM to move to the right. The <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>percussion</b> (CP) is below the CM. If the blow falls above the CP, the rightward translational motion will be bigger than the leftward rotational motion at P, causing the net initial motion of the fixture to be rightward. If the blow falls below the CP the opposite will occur, rotational motion at P will be larger than translational motion and the fixture will move initially leftward. Only if the blow falls exactly on the CP will the two components of motion cancel out to produce zero net initial movement at point P.|$|E

50|$|All {{the driving}} wheels have an {{out-of-balance}} {{which is caused}} by their off-center crank pins and attached components. The main driving wheels have the greatest unbalance since they have the biggest crankpin {{as well as the}} revolving portion of the main rod. They also have the valve gear eccentric crank and the back end of the eccentric rod. In common with the linked driving wheels they also have their own portion of the side rod weight. The part of the main rod assigned a revolving motion was originally measured by weighing it supported at each end. A more accurate method became necessary which split the revolving and reciprocating parts based on the position of the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>percussion.</b> This position was measured by swinging the rod as a pendulum. The unbalance in the remaining driving wheels is caused by a crankpin and side rod weight. The side rod weights assigned to each crankpin are measured by suspending the rod on as many scales as there are crankpins or by calculation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Appari’s magic cricket bat is the bat {{in which}} the weight of bat is {{increased}} {{at the point of}} percussion. Just by increasing the weight at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>percussion</b> one can hit the ball very well, and for same effort the ball can drop/ travel more distance. The weight of bat can be increased by adding heavy weight material e. g mercury at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>percussion</b> of the bat. The weight of the bat can be increased by using unbreakable glass tubes completely filled with mercury on {{the back side of the}} bat. The shape of the glass tubes may be circular, triangular or any other may be used which gives good fixity application with wood and gives better appearance to the bat. Also the unbreakable glass tubes used of different diameters so that players can choose the bat as per their capacity. The colour of glass tubes which are completely filled with mercury can be kept black to avoid the problem of reflection of light.
