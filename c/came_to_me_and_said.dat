But we got to halfway through the tour and (captain) Greg Chappell <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> there was trouble {{at the top of}} the order and asked if I would like to open the batting in the county games. I did that and I was quite successful. I think at the end of the tour I finished about fifth in the batting averages. But that didn't seem to make any difference. I was the only one who didn't play a Test match.|$|E

Roger Waters and David Gilmour {{were in the process}} of completing Pink Floyd's Ummagumma album when they got involved with The Madcap Laughs that July and helped Barrett finish his album − [...] "in a two-day sprint", according to Pink Floyd biographer Rick Sanders. [...] "We had very little time," [...] Gilmour recalled in a May 2003 interview. [...] "Syd was very difficult, we got that very frustrated feeling: Look, it's your fucking career, mate. Why don't you get your finger out and do something? The guy was in trouble, and was a close friend for many years before then, so it really was the least one could do." ...|$|E

500|$|The first writers {{assigned}} to the script were twins Julius and Philip Epstein who, against the wishes of Warner Brothers, left at Frank Capra's request early in 1942 {{to work on the}} Why We Fight series in Washington, D.C. While they were gone, the other credited writer, Howard Koch, was assigned; he produced thirty to forty pages. When the Epstein brothers returned after about a month, they were re{{assigned to}} Casablanca and—contrary to what Koch claimed in two published books—his work was not used. The Epstein brothers and Koch never worked in the same room at the same time during the writing of the script. Koch later commented, [...] "When we began, we didn't have a finished script... Ingrid Bergman <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Which man should I love more...?' I said to her, 'I don't know... play them both evenly.' You see we didn't have an ending, so we didn't know what was going to happen!" [...] In the final budget for the film, the Epsteins were paid $30,416, and Koch earned $4,200.|$|E

Speaking to Nick Levine of Digital Spy, Rihanna explained: [...] "I went into the studio making music my way. I found myself all at once." [...] In an interview on This Morning, Rihanna said that the song is not necessarily about a specific personal experience, but rather the general feelings of mental anguish, anxiety and confusion. Rihanna further explained {{that she wanted to}} record the song because she felt that listeners would be able to relate to the subject matter. When Good Girl Gone Bad was repackaged, Rihanna approached L.A. Reid, boss of Def Jam, suggesting to release [...] "Disturbia" [...] as a single and follow-up to [...] "Take a Bow". Speaking to MTV News, Reid said, [...] "It was the first time Rihanna actually <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Here's the song I want to put out.' She played me the song. That was her taking control [...] She understands what hits are, and she knows what she wants to say. She's at that place where she can do that." ...|$|E

500|$|However, {{in a more}} mixed review, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the song [...] "seems {{as if it were}} written by a ninth-grader imagining her rebellious college sister’s lifestyle" [...] and felt that it lacked {{creativity}} within Cyrus' catalog. Writing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan was skeptical of Cyrus' increasingly provocative image, stating that the lyrics in the chorus would be [...] "an odd fit for any singer" [...] and opining that [...] "there's still a bit too much Disney in her voice to fill the track." [...] Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised the song, writing, [...] "Cyrus said in her recent MTV doc (...) , that she chose it to be her album's first single: 'Not everyone <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> okay, you've got the first single. I had to say no, I know this is it and I'll go to battle if I have to, against anyone who doesn't believe in it. Now I have this freedom to do whatever I want, because people trust me.' She was right about this one. The song's straightforward party is now tied to a sordid universe of visuals- the official video and the VMA performance." [...] Common Sense Media gave the song two stars out of five saying that [...] "After listening to the weird intro to [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] you'll kind of wish the song did just stop right there." ...|$|E
