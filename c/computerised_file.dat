40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{to study}} the risk of cancer, {{particularly}} of lung cancer and bladder cancer, among workers in the printing industry according to different occupations.  METHODS—This is a population based retrospective cohort study. The cohort comprised 1332  men and 426  women employed in the printing industry in Iceland according to a published union registry. A <b>computerised</b> <b>file</b> of the cohort was record linked to the Cancer Registry by making use of personal identification numbers. Expected numbers of cases of cancer were calculated {{on the basis of}} number of person-years and specific incidences of cancer sites for men and women provided by the Cancer Registry.  RESULTS—Among the men (36   217. 5 person-years at risk) there were 125  observed cancers versus 123. 66  expected, standardised incidence ratio (SIR) 1. 01,  95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) was 0. 84  to 1. 20.  The SIR (95 % CI) for liver cancer was 1. 97  (0. 55  to 5. 20) and the SIR for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was 2. 26  (0. 96  to 4. 41). No excess risk for cancer was found among women (8631. 0  person-years at risk). The SIR (95 % CI) for liver cancer was 4. 21  (0. 47  to 15. 20) and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma it was 4. 99  (1. 61  to 11. 63) among the typesetters. A survey on smoking habits among active and retired union members showed that they smoked less than a random sample of the general population.  CONCLUSION—The cancer site most often reported to show excess risk among printing industry workers has been the lung and the urinary bladder; however, this was not found in the present study. This may be explained by difference in smoking habits among union members compared with the general population. There is a high occurrence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, particularly among typesetters, which warrants further studies.    Keywords: printing industry; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; smoking habit...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{describe}} the cancer pattern in {{a cohort of}} commercial pilots by follow up through the Icelandic Cancer Registry.  METHODS—This is a retrospective cohort study of 458  pilots with emphasis on subcohort working for an airline operating on international routes. A <b>computerised</b> <b>file</b> of the cohort was record linked to the Cancer Registry by making use of personal identification numbers. Expected numbers of cancer cases were calculated {{on the basis of}} number of person-years and incidences of cancer at specific sites for men provided by the Cancer Registry. Numbers of separate analyses were made according to different exposure variables.  RESULTS—The standardised incidence ratio (SIR) for all cancers was 0. 97  (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 62  to 1. 46) in the total cohort and 1. 16  (95 % CI 0. 70  to 1. 81) among those operating on international routes. The SIR for malignant melanoma of the skin was 10. 20,  95 % CI 3. 29  to 23. 81  in the total cohort and 15. 63,  95 % CI 5. 04  to 36. 46  in the restricted cohort. Analyses according to number of block-hours and radiation dose showed that malignant melanomas were found in the subgroups with highest exposure estimates, the SIRs were 13. 04  and 28. 57  respectively. The SIR was 25. 00  for malignant melanoma among those who had been flying over five time zones.  CONCLUSIONS—The study shows a high occurrence of malignant melanoma among pilots. It is open to discussion what role exposure of cosmic radiation, numbers of block-hours flown, or lifestyle factors—such as possible excessive sunbathing—play in the aetiology of cancer among pilots. This calls for further and more powerful studies. The excess of malignant melanoma among those flying over five time zones suggests that the importance of disturbance of the circadian rhythm should be taken into consideration in future studies.    Keywords: cancer registry; malignant melanoma of the skin; cosmic radiation; block-hours; time zone...|$|E

Aim: assess the feasibility of a computerised, automated and safe transfer of standardised consultation reports (SCRs) from general practitioners (GPs) to hospital doctors (HDs). Methods: An SCR was drawn up. When the GP did not have a <b>computerised</b> medical <b>file</b> (CMF), he sent the SCR to the network by fax or post. When the GP had a CMF, the SCR was integrated into his medical software program and sent to the network, either by autonomous fax or, automatically,by integrated fax or safe email. The SCRs receivedby the network in paper form were entered manually into a database while those received in computerised form were automatically included in the network’s database. The network then sent the SCR to the HD looking after the patient. Results: In this set up, the GP keeps his existing working environment. He does not need specific training. The necessarytools may be used with the majority of medical software programs. Conclusion: This transfer meets the needs of information exchanges from GPs to HDs who are following up the HIV positive patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Case-finding {{strategies}} to identify women with {{high risk for}} osteoporotic fractures have recently been proposed, but little information about such an approach in general practice is known. AIM: To study {{the validity of the}} proposed case-finding strategy for osteoporosis. DESIGN OF STUDY: Survey using case-finding strategy. SETTING: Seven hundred and twelve women aged between 55 and 84 years, randomly selected from a general practice in The Netherlands. METHOD: Of the 712 randomly selected women, 449 women participated. Information was obtained from a questionnaire, direct questioning, and <b>computerised</b> patients <b>files.</b> Bone mineral density of the femoral neck was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and vertebral morphometry was performed on lateral X-rays of the spine. Osteoporosis was defined by a bone mineral density T-score of less than 2. 5 and/or the presence of severe vertebral deformities. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated for the whole set of risk factors; those significantly associated with osteoporosis and in logistic models. RESULTS: Clinical risk factors were present in 55 % of the women and identified 68 % of the women with osteoporosis. Three risk factors [...] a low body mass index, fragility fractures, and severe kyphosis and/or loss of height [...] were associated significantly with osteoporosis; they were present in 33 % of the women and identified 60 % of those with osteoporosis. A logistic model based on age and fragility fractures selected 32 % of the women and identified 76 %. CONCLUSION: No single risk factor could assist in identifying women with osteoporosis. A simplified case-finding strategy using only three risk factors, that is suitable for primary care, reduces the number of women to be evaluated by two-thirds; however, this is at the cost of missing the diagnosis in 40 % of the women with osteoporosis. Addition of spine radiographs to the case-finding approach helped to obtain a better risk profile of the women and had also practical consequences for the management of some. We propose that radiographs should be included in any case-finding strategy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{cost the}} {{relation}} between socioeconomic status and various measures of primary care workload and assess the adequacy of current "deprivation" payments in relation to actual costings for patients living in qualifying areas. DESIGN: Retrospective data on primary care were collected over a 4. 5 year period from both <b>computerised</b> and manually <b>filed</b> records. Standardised data on socioeconomic status were obtained by postal questionnaire. SETTING: Inner city group practice with a socioeconomically diverse population. SUBJECTS: 382 male and female subjects of all ages, {{with a total of}} 1296 person years of observation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary care costs resulting from consultations with a general practitioner or a practice nurse and both new and repeat prescriptions. RESULTS: Morbidity, workload, and costs of drug treatment increased with decreasing socioeconomic status. The difference in cost for patients in social classes IV and V combined compared with those in I and II combined was about 150 Pounds per person year at risk (47 Pounds for workload and 103 Pounds for drugs). Deprivation payments met only half the extra workload cost for patients from qualifying wards. CONCLUSIONS: The greater workload caused by social disadvantage has been previously underestimated by simple consultation rates. The absolute difference in costs for socially disadvantaged patients increase as more detailed measures of workload and drug treatment are included. Current deprivation payments only partially offset the increased expenditure on workload. This shortfall will have to be addressed to attract general practitioners to, or retain them in, deprived areas...|$|R

40|$|Barmah Forest virus (BFV) {{disease is}} one of the most {{widespread}} mosquito-borne diseases in Australia. The number of outbreaks and the incidence rate of BFV in Australia have attracted growing concerns about the spatio-temporal complexity and underlying risk factors of BFV disease. A large number of notifications has been recorded continuously in Queensland since 1992. Yet, little is known about the spatial and temporal characteristics of the disease. I aim to use notification data to better understand the effects of climatic, demographic, socio-economic and ecological risk factors on the spatial epidemiology of BFV disease transmission, develop predictive risk models and forecast future disease risks under climate change scenarios. <b>Computerised</b> data <b>files</b> of daily notifications of BFV disease and climatic variables in Queensland during 1992 - 2008 were obtained from Queensland Health and Australian Bureau of Meteorology, respectively. Projections on climate data for years 2025, 2050 and 2100 were obtained from Council of Scientific Industrial Research Organisation. Data on socio-economic, demographic and ecological factors were also obtained from relevant government departments as follows: 1) socio-economic and demographic data from Australian Bureau of Statistics; 2) wetlands data from Department of Environment and Resource Management and 3) tidal readings from Queensland Department of Transport and Main roads. Disease notifications were geocoded and spatial and temporal patterns of disease were investigated using geostatistics. Visualisation of BFV disease incidence rates through mapping reveals the presence of substantial spatio-temporal variation at statistical local areas (SLA) over time. Results reveal high incidence rates of BFV disease along coastal areas compared to the whole area of Queensland. A Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square analysis for trend reveals a statistically significant relationship between BFV disease incidence rates and age groups (ƒÓ 2 = 7587, p< 0. 01). Semi-variogram analysis and smoothed maps created from interpolation techniques indicate that the pattern of spatial autocorrelation was not homogeneous across the state. A cluster analysis was used to detect the hot spots/clusters of BFV disease at a SLA level. Most likely spatial and space-time clusters are detected at the same locations across coastal Queensland (p< 0. 05). The study demonstrates heterogeneity of disease risk at a SLA level and reveals the spatial and temporal clustering of BFV disease in Queensland. Discriminant analysis was employed to establish a link between wetland classes, climate zones and BFV disease. This is because the importance of wetlands in the transmission of BFV disease remains unclear. The multivariable discriminant modelling analyses demonstrate that wetland types of saline 1, riverine and saline tidal influence were the most significant risk factors for BFV disease in all climate and buffer zones, while lacustrine, palustrine, estuarine and saline 2 and saline 3 wetlands were less important.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} is ranked by the World Health Organisation {{as one of}} the top ten contributors to the global burden of disease and injury. Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to air {{pollution is}} associated with cardiorespiratory diseases. However, most of the previous studies have looked at this issue using air pollution data from a single monitoring site or average values from a few monitoring sites in a city. There is increasing concern that the relationships between air pollution and mortality may vary with geographical area, particularly for a big city. This thesis consisted of three interlinked studies that aimed to examine the spatial variation in the relationship between long-term exposure to air pollution and cardiorespiratory mortality in Brisbane, Australia. The first study evaluated the long-term air pollution trends in Brisbane, Australia. Air pollution data used in this study were provided by the Queensland Environmental Protection Agency (QEPA). The data comprised the daily average concentrations of particulate matter less then 10 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM 10), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), ozone (O 3) and sulphur dioxide (SO 2) between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 2004 in two monitoring sites (i. e. Eagle farm and Rocklea), and in other available monitoring sites between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2004. <b>Computerised</b> data <b>files</b> of daily mortality between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2004 in Brisbane city were provided by the Office of Economic and Statistical Research of the Queensland Treasury. Population data and the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) data in 2001 were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for each statistical local area (SLA) of the Brisbane city. The long-term air pollution (the daily maximum 1 -hour average or daily 24 -hour average concentrations of NO 2, O 3 and PM 10) trends were evaluated using a polynomial regression model in two monitoring sites (Eagle Farm and Rocklea) in Brisbane, Australia, between 1980 and 2003. The study found that there were significant up-and-down features for air pollution concentrations in both monitoring sites in Brisbane. Rocklea recorded a substantially higher number of days with concentrations above the relevant daily maximum 1 -hour or 24 -hour standards than that in Eagle Farm. Additionally, there was a significant spatial variation in air pollution concentrations between these areas. Therefore, the results indicated a need to examine the spatial variation in the relationship between long-term exposure to air pollution and cardiorespiratory mortality in Brisbane. The second study examined the spatial variation of SO 2 concentrations and cardiorespiratory mortality in Brisbane between 1999 and 2001. Air pollutant concentrations were estimated using geographical information systems (GIS) techniques at a SLA level. Spatial distribution analysis and a multivariable logistic regression model were employed to investigate the impact of gaseous air pollution on cardiorespiratory mortality after adjusting for potential confounding effects of age, sex, calendar year and SEIFA. The results of this study indicate that for every 1 ppb increase in annual average SO 2 concentration, there was an estimated increase of 4. 4...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of many arboviral diseases is largely associated with {{social and environmental}} conditions. Ross River virus (RRV) is the most prevalent arboviral disease in Australia. It has long been recognised that the transmission pattern of RRV is sensitive to socio-ecological factors including climate variation, population movement, mosquito-density and vegetation types. This study aimed to assess the relationships between socio-environmental variability and the transmission of RRV using spatio-temporal analytic methods. <b>Computerised</b> data <b>files</b> of daily RRV disease cases and daily climatic variables in Brisbane, Queensland during 1985 - 2001 {{were obtained from the}} Queensland Department of Health and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, respectively. Available information on other socio-ecological factors was also collected from relevant government agencies as follows: 1) socio-demographic data from the Australia Bureau of Statistics; 2) information on vegetation (littoral wetlands, ephemeral wetlands, open freshwater, riparian vegetation, melaleuca open forests, wet eucalypt, open forests and other bushland) from Brisbane City Council; 3) tidal activities from the Queensland Department of Transport; and 4) mosquito-density from Brisbane City Council. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used as an exploratory technique for discovering spatial and temporal pattern of RRV distribution. The PCA results show that the first principal component accounted for approximately 57 % of the information, which contained the four seasonal rates and loaded highest and positively for autumn. K-means cluster analysis indicates that the seasonality of RRV is characterised by three groups with high, medium and low {{incidence of}} disease, and it suggests that {{there are at least three}} different disease ecologies. The variation in spatio-temporal patterns of RRV indicates a complex ecology that is unlikely to be explained by a single dominant transmission route across these three groupings. Therefore, there is need to explore socio-economic and environmental determinants of RRV disease at the statistical local area (SLA) level. Spatial distribution analysis and multiple negative binomial regression models were employed to identify the socio-economic and environmental determinants of RRV disease at both the city and local (ie, SLA) levels. The results show that RRV activity was primarily concentrated in the northeast, northwest and southeast areas in Brisbane. The negative binomial regression models reveal that RRV incidence for the whole of the Brisbane area was significantly associated with Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) at a lag of 3 months (Relative Risk (RR) : 1. 12; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 06 - 1. 17), the proportion of people with lower levels of education (RR: 1. 02; 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 1. 03), the proportion of labour workers (RR: 0. 97; 95 % CI: 0. 95 - 1. 00) and vegetation density (RR: 1. 02; 95 % CI: 1. 00 - 1. 04). However, RRV incidence for high risk areas (ie, SLAs with higher incidence of RRV) was significantly associated with mosquito density (RR: 1. 01; 95 % CI: 1. 00 - 1. 01), SOI at a lag of 3 months (RR: 1. 48; 95 % CI: 1. 23 - 1. 78), human population density (RR: 3. 77; 95 % CI: 1. 35 - 10. 51), the proportion of indigenous population (RR: 0. 56; 95 % CI: 0. 37 - 0. 87) and the proportion of overseas visitors (RR: 0. 57; 95 % CI: 0. 35 - 0. 92). It is acknowledged that some of these risk factors, while statistically significant, are small in magnitude. However, given the high incidence of RRV, they may still be important in practice. The results of this study suggest that the spatial pattern of RRV disease in Brisbane is determined by a combination of ecological, socio-economic and environmental factors. The possibility of developing an epidemic forecasting system for RRV disease was explored using the multivariate Seasonal Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) technique. The results of this study suggest that climatic variability, particularly precipitation, may have played a significant role in the transmission of RRV disease in Brisbane. This finding cannot entirely be explained by confounding factors such as other socio-ecological conditions because they have been unlikely to change dramatically on a monthly time scale in this city over the past two decades. SARIMA models show that monthly precipitation at a lag 2 months (= 0. 004,p= 0. 031) was statistically significantly associated with RRV disease. It suggests that there may be 50 more cases a year for an increase of 100 mm precipitation on average in Brisbane. The predictive values in the model were generally consistent with actual values (root-mean-square error (RMSE) : 1. 96). Therefore, this model may have applications as a decision support tool in disease control and risk-management planning programs in Brisbane. The Polynomial distributed lag (PDL) time series regression models were performed to examine the associations between rainfall, mosquito density and the occurrence of RRV after adjusting for season and auto-correlation. The PDL model was used because rainfall and mosquito density can affect not merely RRV occurring in the same month, but in several subsequent months. The rationale for the use of the PDL technique is that it increases the precision of the estimates. We developed an epidemic forecasting model to predict incidence of RRV disease. The results show that 95 % and 85 % of the variation in the RRV disease was accounted for by the mosquito density and rainfall, respectively. The predictive values in the model were generally consistent with actual values (RMSE: 1. 25). The model diagnosis reveals that the residuals were randomly distributed with no significant auto-correlation. The results of this study suggest that PDL models may be better than SARIMA models (R-square increased and RMSE decreased). The findings of this study may facilitate the development of early warning systems for the control and prevention of this widespread disease. Further analyses were conducted using classification trees to identify major mosquito species of Ross River virus (RRV) transmission and explore the threshold of mosquito density for RRV disease in Brisbane, Australia. The results show that Ochlerotatus vigilax (RR: 1. 028; 95 % CI: 1. 001 - 1. 057) and Culex annulirostris (RR: 1. 013, 95 % CI: 1. 003 - 1. 023) were significantly associated with RRV disease cycles at a lag of 1 month. The presence of RRV was associated with average monthly mosquito density of 72 Ochlerotatus vigilax and 52 Culex annulirostris per light trap. These results may also have applications as a decision support tool in disease control and risk management planning programs. As RRV has significant impact on population health, industry, and tourism, it is important to develop an epidemic forecast system for this disease. The results of this study show the disease surveillance data can be integrated with social, biological and environmental databases. These data can provide additional input into the development of epidemic forecasting models. These attempts may have significant implications in environmental health decision-making and practices, and may help health authorities determine public health priorities more wisely and use resources more effectively and efficiently...|$|R
40|$|The Euro-Med-Data (EMD) {{project was}} carried out by a working group under the {{co-ordination}} of the School of Public Health of the Université Libre de BRUXELLES (Belgium), Department of Health Policies and Health Systems with financial support of the European Commission, under the Health Monitoring Programme. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Euro-Med-Data (EMD) project was conceived {{to take part in the}} collective effort organised on the European Union level in order to establish community health indicators, to develop a community-wide network for health data sharing and to analyse and report on this data. Its objectives were defined as follows: Ø to inventory the medico-administrative data, routinely collected in 18 European countries at the primary and secondary health care level, as well as at the occupational medicine level (PHC, SHC, OM); Ø to examine this data in terms of data collection process, type of codification, reliability, mobility, mode of concentration, possibility of further analysis and/or reports, type of interpretative framework; Ø to examine the possibilities of transferring this data to a European server and that will handle the problems such as format, language, transfer process, and agreement on designating the person in charge of the data on a local level; Ø to form proposals for feedback of the analysis to the local health care actors; Ø to examine the possibilities for the analysis of the data in order to perform an epidemiological follow-up of public health indicators and health monitoring; There are indeed, at the present time, very few operational European databases in the field of Public Health allowing one to use epidemiological health indicators in order to: Ø monitor the state of health of European populations; Ø evaluate public health needs; Ø assess the use of health care services; Ø and, more broadly, to analyse and fully exploit what is generally meant by Health Monitoring. However, every day, in every European country, medical and administrative data is routinely collected for management or therapeutic purposes, or simply as private memory files. The use of this data for public health management as well as for conducting epidemiological studies is often very far from satisfactory. Furthermore, the lack of feedback to the people who deliver health services generates frustration and promotes a lack of collaboration. The project therefore takes its place in the framework of the hereto accepted 30 other projects. It seems that the EMD project, part of the category of projects linked to a specific collection system, is not redundant but rather complementary in relation to the other project categories, and even to the other ones of the same category. The specificity of Euro-Med-Data lies in the focus on routinely collected data. As we may distinguish different kinds of morbidity indicators (objective, perceived, expressed, diagnosed,…), it is important to notice their conceptual interrelations, and to clearly assess their respective complementary positions in the HIS. Regarding diagnosed morbidity, it is possible to obtain the data from health providers: the data can be based either on probabilistic samples of practices (the sentinel practices network is one example), or on a continuous basis in an integrated routine system. This latter will be the domain to be investigated by the EMD project in three different settings :primary care, secondary care and occupational health. PRIMARY HEALTH CARE General practitioners and family physicians form what is commonly called the primary care level. In several northern European countries, as well as in Italy, Portugal, and Spain, this level plays the role of gatekeeper of the health system. The patient is not authorised to consult a specialised care level (secondary or tertiary care) if he/she has not first consulted a general practitioner with whom he or she generally has a record. This ‘gate’ system is not present in Belgium, France, Germany, Luxemburg, and Greece. It is therefore difficult to obtain a common denominator to set an epidemiological rate. The first step of the research has concentrated on the identification of partners throughout the different countries, i. e. medical doctors and other professionals involved in the elaboration and organisation of continuous registration systems for general practice in medicine. The question of availability of morbidity indicators through these data collections is at the heart of the problem tackled by this analysis. What are the existing databases in Europe? How are they organised? Can the information gathered by these various bases be aggregated and continuously serve as a source of information on the population’s demands for health care as much as on the answers from the health services? Despite certain reservations, the Internet survey form (see chapter II) allowed us to gather essential information on twelve databases. This form was greatly based on work achieved by Dr Job Metsemakers in Holland. In chapter II, one will find a summary of the information obtained, while the entirety of the information collected is available in Access (*. mdb), Excel (*. xls), and text format (*. txt) in the software aid annexed to this report. The various terminologies and classifications were the subject of a study published on the site and featured in the software and annexed to this report. After having explored the various databases in a qualitative and quantitative manner, and outlined the content (chapter III), it seemed constructive to give an overview of the different terminologies and classifications currently available in Europe and in use in the EMR’s or other computerised health systems (see chapter IV). The second step consists in trying to collect data from each participating country to create an international database. This step is quite difficult to address. Although the participants at the first meeting in Brussels have been very enthusiastic, only two have made proposal to exchange information. To build a database in such conditions has no meaning and the research has been continued by editing information already published on the net. Common grounds on methodology of data retrieval and classification tools are lacking in Primary Care and particularly in General practice at the EU level. Moreover only some private or semi-public organisations are collecting data on continuous basis in primary care. The most important ones are mainly for commercial purposes. Some Member States are producing data trough their own department of public health or through university settings in United Kingdom, France, Norway and The Netherlands. However registration tools are quite different. There is no common standard in the classification field. Some systems are using proprietary classification, other use ICD or Read codes and some are using ICPC in its first version. Sharing morbidity data at the PHC level is consequently not feasible although some data are already published and accessible through web sites. (do refer to [URL] and [URL] The main conclusion is that, even if data gathering in PHC on the basis of the day to day work is in process here and there in Europe in General practice, the utilisation of this data for building up health monitoring indicators at the level of EU is not to be considered yet at the time being. Before this option could be considered, effort has to be made to disseminate standardised and compatible health information collecting systems based on international classifications. The group "Data quality in Primary care " driven by various European researchers is now taking the relay of the EMD study. This study concludes by setting up five recommendations on :the development of an Open Source approach for what concerns the electronic medical files software development; Ø to favour the management of individual data in <b>computerised</b> medical <b>files</b> as community health data; Ø to favour implementation of standardisation process in electronic medical record in Europe in order to enhance the quality of data collection Ø promoting European development in the realm of terminologies and classifications; Ø to support the new research group on “Data quality in Primary care”. SECONDARY HEALTH CARE The secondary health care sector is characterised in Europe by a certain homogeneity for what concerns the medical data collected routinely in the hospitals; this is due to the fact that the national classification systems for hospital data are based on the ICD (International Classification of Diseases), and the consequent proposals resulting initially from Fetter’s works in the USA. The hospital medical data are collected at the request of the Ministries of Health with epidemiological and/or financial purposes (financing of the hospitals) in all the European countries except Germany where these data are not centralised, but are sent to the sickness-benefit fund of each patient with the aim of financing the care for each patient, and subsequently covering the costs of the hospitals. To achieve the goals of this study, the methodology used consisted in identifying partners in each country, in preparing a questionnaire concerning the characteristics and the contents of each medical data file, and in making a test of feasibility for the creation of a European database by the aggregation of samples coming from each country. At the end of this study, we can affirm that the objectives are mainly achieved, with regard to the sector of the secondary care. Indeed, for all the participating countries (except Liechtenstein), we were able to collect information on the hospital medical data recorded routinely in each country. This information (meta-information) is gathered in summary charts (one by country). The test of feasibility of the creation and the exploitation of a European database, realised for 11 participating countries, has very encouraging results because it proves the feasibility of the creation of this European database with the help of the installation of various procedures on the one hand, and the definition of certain terms or variables on the other hand. The exploitation of such database currently allows the construction of 37 health indicators covering the following fields :Ø indicators of morbidity, Ø use of the care of health, Ø surgical operations and procedures Ø and quality and performance of the health care. The conclusions of this test lead quite naturally to proposals on short, average and long term. These should constitute the basis for the continuation of the work in this field of the secondary care, or hospital care. The short-term proposals take again the coordination of the various projects currently in hand or to come concerning these problems, the methods and the creation of the European data base as well as the creation of a conversion chart for the classifications of pathologies and procedures. The medium-term proposals relate to the extension of the content of the database in order to increase the number of indicators which result from it, and to the procedures for enlarging this database to include the candidate countries. Lastly, the long-term proposals concentrate mainly on the evaluation of the possibilities of connection and linking between the primary care database and that of secondary care. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH The routine collection of data at work presents certain special features related to the actual context of health in the workplace, namely: 1. The existence of a proper legislation; 2. The division of labour and, consequently, of health risks; 3. Medical practice at work has a preventive mission, sometimes a therapeutic mission in the case of health disorders related to the specific exposure and to occupational diseases. It also plays a rehabilitative role in cases of accidents at work and occupational diseases; 4. On the European and national level, the organisations centred on the field of health at work are mainly tripartite structures: government representatives, employers, and workers. During the first phase of the EMD study, the characteristics cited above were identified and their influence on the feasibility of a continuous collection of data was underlined. The second phase focused on: a) the study of European directives relating to the health and security of workers; b) their sectoral application in Member States; and c) the feasibility of their application on the European level. Globally, the conclusion was that a great number of routine data are available at the local level, but it is currently impossible to use them on a regional, national, and a fortiori an international level given the harmonisation problems. Except for data on accidents at work and occupational diseases, the examination of these routine databases demonstrates the impossibility of using these databases as comparable international reference databases in the elaboration of a European morbidity data bank. They are too different from each other and their objectives are usually incompatible with the aims of this study. Finally, a careful analysis was performed on the various indicators for the sector proposed by the ECHI project (Kramers et al. 2001). They were extensively reviewed during the second meeting, on December 5 th 2001. This did allow us to formulate recommendations in order to pursue the reflections on indicators of health at work. Short term: some recommendations are made on the possible improvement of the list of indicators, specially for health determinants. Medium term: they concern a better standardisation of data collection, the implementation of additional legislative tools to increase the convergence between countries; a reflection has also to be conducted on the respective advantages of routine and survey data in this field. At longer term, there would be a substantial interest in setting up the statistical tools allowing a linking and a comparison of data on the worker’s characterisation within the firm, on the one hand, and the data on mortality (cause by cause) along with the data related to accidents at work and occupational on the other hand.
