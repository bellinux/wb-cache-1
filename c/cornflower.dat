5|$|The {{idea of an}} Anschluss (union between Austria and Germany to form a Greater Germany), {{was one of the}} {{principle}} ideas of the Austrian branch of the National Socialist (Nazi) Party. Nazism can be seen as descended from the radical branches of the pan-Germanist movement. In 1933, the Nazis and the Greater German People's Party formed a joint working-group, and eventually merged. During the period while the Nazi Party and its symbols were banned in Austria, from 1933 to 1938, Austrian Nazis resumed the earlier pan-Germanist tradition of wearing a blue <b>cornflower</b> in their buttonhole.|$|E

25|$|In {{support of}} Ankhesenamun, {{is the idea}} that Tutankhamun 'lie in state' for some time. The Hittite sources {{indicate}} he died in the fall. Of course the Hittite sources may not be true, but then carvings in tomb's back up the Hittite sources. However, a <b>cornflower</b> pectoral indicates he was not buried until April or May. As such, there may have been time for letter writing and travel. Ankhesenamun is made more plausible if she had the backing of Ay, or Horemheb, or both. Against her is the simpler explanation that the delay in burial was the result of his unexpected death and unfinished tomb.|$|E
25|$|Yogo sapphires {{sometimes}} {{do not need}} heat treating because their <b>cornflower</b> blue coloring is uniform and deep, they are generally free of the characteristic inclusions, and they have high uniform clarity. When Intergem Limited began marketing the Yogo in the 1980s as the world's only guaranteed untreated sapphire, heat treatment was not commonly disclosed; by 1982 the heat treatment became a major issue. At that time, 95% of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. This issue appeared as a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal on 29 August 1984 in an article by Bill Richards, Carats and Schticks: Sapphire Marketer Upsets The Gem Industry.|$|E

500|$|The {{plant in}} front of John the Baptist has aspects of both hyssop and <b>cornflower,</b> yet is most likely a hyssop because it grows from a wall. <b>Cornflower</b> is an {{attribute}} of Christ and symbolizes Heaven while hyssop symbolizes both the humility of Christ and baptism. There is a citron tree in the background, which represents the Cedar of Lebanon. Michelangelo uses the hyssop and tree as a visual representation of a quote by Rabanus Maurus, [...] "From the Cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop which grows on a stony wall we have {{an explanation of the}} Divinity which Christ has in his Father and of the humanity that he derives from the Virgin Mary." [...] The clover in the foreground represents the Trinity and salvation. [...] The anemone plant represents the Trinity and the Passion of Christ.|$|E
500|$|Sapphires are a color {{variety of}} corundum, a {{crystalline}} form of aluminium oxide (...) [...] Corundum {{is one of}} the hardest minerals, rating9 on the Mohs scale. Corundum gems of most colors are called sapphires, except for red ones, which are called rubies. The term [...] "Yogo sapphire" [...] refers only to sapphires from the Yogo Gulch. [...] The <b>cornflower</b> blue color of the Yogo results from trace amounts of iron and titanium. Yogo sapphires are unique in that they are free of cavities and inclusions, have high uniform clarity, lack color zoning, and do not need heat treating because their <b>cornflower</b> blue coloring is uniform and deep. Unlike Asian sapphires, they maintain their brilliance in artificial light. Yogos present an advantage to gemcutters: since they are found as primary constituent minerals within an igneous bedrock rather than in sedimentary alluvial deposits where most other sapphires are located, they retain a perfect or near perfect crystalline shape, making cutting much easier, as does their lack of inclusions, color zoning, or cloudiness. Yogos also exhibit a triangular pattern on the basal plane of the flattened crystals, with thin rhombohedral crystal faces, a feature absent in sapphires from other parts of Montana.|$|E

500|$|Yogo sapphires are {{a variety}} of {{corundum}} found only in Yogo Gulch, part of the Little Belt Mountains in Judith Basin County, Montana, United States, on land once inhabited by the Piegan Blackfeet people. Yogos are typically <b>cornflower</b> blue, a result of trace amounts of iron and titanium. They have high uniform clarity and maintain their brilliance under artificial light. Because Yogo sapphires occur within a vertically dipping resistive igneous dike, mining efforts have been sporadic and rarely profitable. It is estimated that at least 28million carats (...) of Yogos are still in the ground. Jewelry containing Yogos was given to First Ladies Florence Harding and Bess Truman; in addition, many gems were sold in Europe, though promoters' claims that Yogos are in the crown jewels of England or the engagement ring of Princess Diana are dubious. [...] Today, several Yogo sapphires are part of the Smithsonian Institution's gem collection.|$|E
