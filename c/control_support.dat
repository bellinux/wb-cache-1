5|$|On July 20, 2011, at the San Diego Comic-Con International, Capcom {{announced}} that {{an updated version}} of Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds was under development. The update, titled Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, would add new characters, stages, modes, and other enhancements to improve the game's balance and online functionality. According to Capcom, many new features and refinements, such as the addition of a spectator mode and tweaks to X-Factor, were the results of fan feedback. At the 2011 Tokyo Game Show, Capcom video game producer, Yoshinori Ono, would later announce that the game would also be released as a launch title for the PlayStation Vita. The handheld edition promised to contain the same content as the console versions, in addition to touchscreen <b>control</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E

25|$|On 14 July 1950, Almond formed his own {{targeting}} {{section in}} his headquarters, {{to compete with}} the Air Force target system. On 23 July, General Otto P. Weyland, who had commanded forward air <b>control</b> <b>support</b> for General George S. Patton during World War II, submitted a memo claiming that Almond's targeting section was incompetent. In a staff meeting the following day, Almond unsuccessfully tried to intimidate Weyland into changing his views. Though Almond's targeting section was dissolved on 2 August, it was emblematic of his belief that forward air control was the least of the Air Force's concerns. Almond's belief that tactical air squadrons should be parceled out to support individual infantry divisions harked back to the doctrine of early World War II. Almond largely commandeered the 1st Marine Air Wing and its auxiliary U.S. Navy aviation to fly close air support for his X Corps.|$|E

MSSCCI was first used to integrate Visual SourceSafe with Visual Studio 6.0 but was later opened up via the Visual Studio SDK. Visual Studio [...]NET 2002 used MSSCCI 1.1, and Visual Studio [...]NET 2003 used MSSCCI 1.2.

With the ELS audio system, audio CDs are automatically ripped to the hard drive upon insertion for future playback. The navigation system also stores its map data on the hard drive (as opposed to the previous model's DVD-based storage), producing faster boot times.|$|E

40|$|We {{present some}} results {{concerning}} the controllability of a quasi-linear parabolic equation (with linear principal part) in a bounded domain of R^N with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We analyze the controllability problem with distributed <b>controls</b> (<b>supported</b> {{on a small}} open subset) and boundary <b>controls</b> (<b>supported</b> on {{a small part of}} the boundary). We prove that the system is null and approximately controllable at any time if the nonlinear term f(y, ∇ y) grows slower than |y| ^ 3 / 2 (1 + |y| + |∇ y|) + |∇ y| ^ 1 / 2 (1 + |y| + |∇ y|) at infinity (generally, in this case, in the absence of control, blow-up occurs). The proofs use global Carleman estimates, parabolic regularity, and the fixed point method. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{controllability}} properties of systems which provide a description, at first approximation, {{of a kind}} of viscoelastic fluid. We consider linear Maxwell fluids. First, we establish the large time approximate-finite dimensional controllability of the system, with distributed or boundary <b>controls</b> <b>supported</b> by arbitrary small sets. Then, we prove the large time exact controllability of fluids of the same kind with <b>controls</b> <b>supported</b> by suitable large sets. The proofs of these results rely on classical arguments. In particular, the approximate controllability result is implied by appropriate unique continuation properties, while exact controllability is a consequence of observability (inverse) inequalities. We also discuss questions concerning the controllability of viscoelastic fluids and some related open problems. Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovació...|$|R
2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{released}} its {{report on the}} accident on [...] April 25, 1973. While it was “unable to determine why each crew failed to see and avoid the other aircraft,” it concluded that the crash resulted from [...] "the failure of both flight crews to detect visually the other aircraft in sufficient time to initiate evasive action,” and stated that it believed “that the ability of both crews to detect the other aircraft in time to avoid a collision was reduced because of the atmospheric conditions and human visual limitations." [...] The NTSB speculated that both flight crews could have been scanning instruments in preparation for descent to their respective destinations {{at the time of}} the collision, and this could have reduced their chances of spotting one another. The report also noted that the decision by both flight crews to fly under VFR rather than IFR and the fact that neither captain requested in-flight advisories deprived both aircraft of air traffic <b>control</b> <b>support,</b> and that such support to even one of the aircraft would have ensured sufficient separation to avoid a collision.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Social <b>control</b> and <b>support</b> have {{effects on}} smoking cessation, but are mostly {{examined}} separately. PURPOSE: Interacting effects of social <b>control</b> and <b>support</b> are investigated, hypothesizing synergistic effects. METHODS: In 99 smokers, received social <b>control</b> and emotional <b>support</b> (both smoking specific) were assessed 2  weeks before a quit date (T 1); objectively verified abstinence and self-reported numbers of cigarettes smoked daily were assessed 6  weeks after baseline (T 2). RESULTS: For both outcomes, associations with control (T 1) were moderated by support (T 1), but beneficial synergistic effects (high control/high support) emerged for few participants only. Effects were mainly driven by constellations of low control/high support {{associated with more}} cigarettes smoked daily (T 2) and low control/low support linked to higher likelihood of abstinence (T 2). CONCLUSIONS: Different constellations of levels of <b>control</b> and <b>support</b> may be beneficial for quitting smoking. Whereas synergies of high domain-specific <b>control</b> and <b>support</b> may be beneficial, they only rarely occur...|$|R
