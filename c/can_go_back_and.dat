25|$|Although, no one <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{make a new}} start, {{anyone can}} start now and make a new end. - Chico Xavier.|$|E
500|$|Singer {{described}} {{the film as}} Double Indemnity meets Rashomon, and {{said that it was}} made [...] "so you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> see all sorts of things you didn't realize were there the first time. You can get it a second time in a way you never could have the first time around." [...] He also compared the film's structure to Citizen Kane (which also contained an interrogator and a subject who is telling a story) and the criminal caper The Anderson Tapes.|$|E
2500|$|... "Black and gold" [...] is a cheer that is {{very popular}} at home games, with {{one part of the}} student section yelling [...] "Black!", and {{the other part of the}} section {{answering}} back with their loudest [...] "Gold!" [...] This <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth for several minutes, with both sides competing to be the louder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go with them, Sam--they {{may need}} you!" [...] broke {{in the girl}} quickly. [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> alone, <b>and</b> I'll send word to the authorities, over the telephone. Hurry! hurry, or {{it will be too}} late!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop {{where you}} are! I have a pistol, and I will shoot you in turn {{if you come}} any nearer. I am a free man! I {{have a right to}} go where I please. I have lost my sledge, but I <b>can</b> walk. <b>Go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> tell your masters I have left their service." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “Oh yes, most definitely, {{because the}} doctors <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> on that <b>and</b> {{have a look}} {{to see how you}} went after the operation, with the {{difference}} before and after.” (Patient 1).|$|R
2500|$|Maddux {{was also}} known for {{intensely}} studying hitters in preparation for his starts. He would often watch hitters take their warmup swings or read their body language to gauge their mentality. Teammate Tom Glavine said, [...] "I think the hitters think he <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> recall every pitch he has ever thrown. That's not the case, but I think he's probably better at remembering things than most people are. He's definitely better {{in the course of}} the game at making adjustments on a hitter based on what he's seen, whether it's one swing or a guy's last at-bat." ...|$|E
2500|$|With 19 Recordings {{continuing}} to manage him, DeWyze chose {{to take an}} optimistic view {{of the situation and}} saw it as an opportunity to finally make the record that he had always wanted to make. Feeling that he had been misunderstood as an artist, he returned to a folk rock sound, more comparable to what had been present on his independent albums. Many people were surprised to hear him release music in this style and drew comparisons to Mumford & Sons, but DeWyze responded, [...] "anyone <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> listen to what I was doing when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, {{those are the kind of}} records that I was making then. I just wasn't able to put them out there like I am now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Timberlake has co-owned or {{provided}} celebrity endorsement {{for three}} {{restaurants in the}} United States: [...] "Chi" [...] opened in West Hollywood, California in 2003, and [...] "Destino" [...] and [...] "Southern Hospitalty" [...] in New York opened in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2005, Timberlake launched the William Rast clothing line with childhood friend Juan ("Trace") Ayala. The 2007 line contained cord jackets, cashmere sweaters, jeans, and polo shirts. The pair reports inspiration from fellow Memphis native Elvis Presley: [...] "Elvis is the perfect mixture of Justin and I," [...] Ayala says. [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> see pictures of him in cowboy boots and a cowboy hat and a nice button-down shirt, but then again you can see him in a tux and a collared shirt with rhinestones on it and slacks. We like to think 'If he was alive today, what would he be wearing?'" [...] Target has announced that a William Rast collection, including denim, outerwear and sportswear for men and women, would launch in December and be available for a month. In 2015, the clothing line earned him a Lord & Taylor's Fashion Oracle Award at the Fashion Group International's Night of The Stars Gala. An avid amateur golfer, in 2007 Timberlake purchased the run-down Big Creek Golf Course in his home town of Millington, Tennessee, which he redeveloped as the eco-friendly Mirimichi Golf Course {{at a cost of}} some $US16 million. It was reopened on July 25, 2009 but closed again on January 15, 2010 for further improvements expected to take six months. In October 2011, Timberlake received the Futures Award at the Environmental Media Awards for his green-conscious golf course. It was reported on November 7, 2014, that Timberlake had sold Mirimichi to Three Star Leasing LLC for $500,000. Timberlake and his wife Jessica Biel are minority owners of the Memphis Grizzlies.|$|E
5000|$|Because they totally loathe {{their new}} life, they do {{everything}} bad at school to get expelled {{so that they}} <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Birmingham <b>and</b> then regret it. They apologise to Dad and make him biscuits.|$|R
5000|$|Carl Edwards, who {{qualified}} second, {{said as he}} [...] "crossed the line, I felt like, 'That’s it.' But {{after seeing}} what (Truex) ran, I thought 'Well, maybe I could <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> change this or that,' {{but that was a}} really good lap for me. It just was. You <b>can</b> always <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> pick your lap apart, but the last two weeks, Indy and here, I was pretty proud of my lap, and they just got us." ...|$|R
5000|$|Buzo said {{making a}} telemovie was tough. [...] "It is so silent, {{it is like}} {{swimming}} underwater. When I saw the rough cut I was a bit shocked because the film medium seems unsubstantial compared to the stage... I think the stage is more malleable; if something doesn't work you can change it immediately. If something doesn't work on television you just <b>can</b> 't <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> change it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{get your}} driving horses in. We have been chasing a sleigh {{with no one}} in it," [...] he said. [...] "Larry has beaten us again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Belsky {{stared at}} him in the stupefaction to which the American humor {{commonly}} reduced him. [...] "If he gets left on the Grossetto line, he <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> come up by Orvieto, no?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{thinking}} we {{was going home}} with our recruits," [...] Sparrowhawk slipped in. [...] "Lord lumme, that Miss Lackland ain't never satisfied. 'I'll take 'em on the Martha,' says she, 'and you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> fill up again.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord, I {{think the}} truth is that you hardly know how strong in such a matter as this our Marion herself can be. Neither have I nor has her father prevailed upon her. I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> now, <b>and</b> tell you without breach of {{confidence}} all that passed between her and me. When first your name was discussed between us; when first I saw that you seemed to make much of her--" ...|$|R
50|$|A player {{may also}} tenuki {{even though the}} opponent's last move is {{somewhat}} damaging, if he feels that his play {{will be even more}} damaging to the opponent. He would be willing to accept the loss he anticipates, because he expects a greater gain from the move he makes instead of answering. Players also tenuki when they believe that the opponent will be required to answer. If this happens, they <b>can</b> then <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> answer the previous move.|$|R
50|$|Some {{interviewees}} {{and friends}} of Rant speculate that crashing a car while in a given state of mind, will jar a person outside of time. Once this is accomplished, they <b>can</b> then <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> kill off all of their ancestors, in turn, making them immortal. Or they can, through incest, make themselves into something more than human. The latter {{is believed to have}} happened to Green Taylor Simms, a fellow Party Crasher, who is implied to be Buster Casey in some form.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Up here, I {{figure out}} {{all sorts of}} plans to keep her amused. I kind of feel {{life is going to}} be different, now that we're getting a good rest and <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> start over again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{horse is}} gone lame, and he {{say you do}} that," [...] cried Tony Duval. [...] "I do not want such people as you around my place. You <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> you must stay off my property," [...] and Tony Duval {{emphasized}} his words by handling his shotgun suggestively.|$|E
6000|$|... "But we {{were off}} by train to Kansas at five o'clock the next morning. The devil wouldn't keep him sober, and he died of D.T. the day after we got him to 'Frisco. So there's the truth of it, and you needn't go to New York at all. Hand me the dollars. I'll be off to the States; and you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> marry the widow,--or leave her alone, just as you please." ...|$|E
50|$|Over time, {{the terms}} of an order {{may need to be}} changed. If there has been a serious change in your {{circumstances}} or in the circumstances of the children since an order was made, you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to court <b>and</b> ask that the order be changed to suit the new circumstances. This is called varying an order.|$|R
5000|$|He {{recruits}} a young Liverpudlian [...] "Jack Frost" [...] to {{the cell}} so they <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> in time <b>and</b> recruit the Marquis de Sade as well. Captured while saving Lord Fanny, King Mob is tortured by Sir Miles Delacourt, during which he has a vision or hallucination of an alien spaceship in Australia. King Mob psychically forces Delacourt to free him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. Do {{you leave}} him alone; stay down here, {{and see what}} will come of it. I quite agree that such a banishment, as you call it, is not a happy {{prospect}} for you;--but it is happier {{than that of a}} marriage with Frank Houston. Give that up, <b>and</b> then you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to London <b>and</b> begin the world again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "you {{shall have}} the picture back--curse you! But listen. If I were you and had wife, or daughter, or {{sweetheart}} like this [...] "--he touched the photograph almost reverently--"why, I'd go through fire and water but I'd keep myself decent; ain't you a silly old fool, now? We've made our piles, you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> take her a fortune, give her jewels and pretty dresses, {{and all the}} fal-de-lals that women love. You'll never do it if you muddle yourself up with that stuff. Pull yourself together, old 'un. Chuck the drink till we've seen this thing through at any rate!" ...|$|E
6000|$|His mood {{had evidently}} changed. [...] "I {{was a fool}} to hold out," [...] he said, [...] "for I had my name for wealth against me, and might have known you would not give way. After all, I {{do not know that}} I am {{altogether}} sorry, for I have always had an idea that some day or other the thing would come out, and now I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> be comfortable {{for the rest of my}} life. How will you have the money, gentlemen? I have 50,000l. in cash, and can give you a draft on the Bank of England for the rest. You look surprised, but I have always been prepared to cut and run from this country at the shortest notice, and every penny I have beyond the cash absolutely required is in England or America." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why? Well, for one thing, {{the reason}} he gave Putney for giving up his luxuries here: {{that as long as}} there was {{hardship}} and overwork for underpay in the world, he must share them. It seems to me that I might as well say that as long as there were dyspepsia and rheumatism in the world, I must share them. Then he has a queer notion that he <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> find instruction in the working-men--that they alone have the light and the truth, and know the meaning of life. I don't say anything against them. My observation and my experience is that if others were as good as they are in the ratio of their advantages, Mr. Peck needn't go to them for his ideal. But their conditions warp and dull them; they see things askew, and they don't see them clearly. I might as well expose myself to the small-pox in hopes of treating my fellow-sufferers more intelligently." ...|$|E
50|$|To {{participate}} in a conference one must first register as a permanent participant, an auditor, or a temporary observer. A participant may contribute items and responses, while an auditor or observer just views them. Once one has joined a conference, CONFER keeps track {{of what has been}} seen for participants and auditors, but not for observers. Each time a conference is visited by a participant or auditor, CONFER displays a list of new information that has been entered since the previous visit. Of course one <b>can</b> always <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> look at old items and responses as well.|$|R
60|$|I {{think now}} {{we will not}} return to the States until about a year from May. I have no idea where we will live on our return, and if we should <b>go</b> <b>back</b> in the fall we would have to {{determine}} the question without delay. We <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> in May <b>and</b> occupy our Long Branch house and have all summer to prepare for the winter.|$|R
5000|$|Bella {{decided to}} not {{to go through with}} the civil union after she {{realised}} that she is holding on to Luke's memory and need to let go. She gave most of the money to Zlata and Luca so they <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Romania <b>and</b> bought the Cooper's house in Wendy and Murray's name {{with the rest of the}} money, leaving her broke but happy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sad!" [...] exclaimed the {{clothing}} man, [...] "not a bit. That's glory, the way I look at it, Colonel. If my Jakie's blood is spilled for his country, and he <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> spill it again, it makes great honor {{for the name}} of Kasker. Say, once they called me pro-German, 'cause I said I hated the war. Don't my Jakie's blood put my name on America's honor roll? I'm pretty proud of Jakie," [...] he wiped his eyes again; [...] "I'll give him an interest in the business, if he comes back. And if he don't--if those cursed Germans put an end to him--then folks will say, 'See Jake Kasker over there? Well, he gave his son for his country--his only son.' Seems to me, Colonel, that evens the score. America gives us Germans protection and prosperity, and we give our blood to defend America's honor. I'm sorry I couldn't find a place for any more flags." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Captain laughed. [...] "Pirates!" [...] said he. [...] "What stuff! There are no pirates {{in these}} days!" [...] {{and then he}} laughed again. [...] "Well, I can't talk any more now," [...] said he, [...] "but I'll keep your {{business}} in my mind, and settle it pretty soon. Then you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> tell your people what I'll do. You had better go on deck and make yourself comfortable. If you'll take my advice, you won't do any talking. The people on this vessel don't know what she carries, and I don't want them to know! So if I see you talking to anybody, I'll consider {{that you want to}} make trouble--and I can tell you, if some of these people on board knew what was in them boxes in the hold, there would be the worst kind of trouble. You can bet your head on that! So you can go on and show yourself. Your friends won't be worried about you--I've explained it all to them in my note!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good; Hawkeye has not a forked tongue, and {{he likes}} {{to say what he}} thinks. He is an {{acquaintance}} of the Muskrat," [...] this was the name by which all the Indians designated Hutter--"and has lived in his wigwam. But he is not a friend. He wants no scalps, like a miserable Indian, but fights like a stout-hearted pale-face. The Muskrat is neither white, nor red. Neither a beast nor a fish. He is a water snake; sometimes in the spring and sometimes on the land. He looks for scalps, like an outcast. Hawkeye <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> tell him how he has outwitted the Hurons, how he has escaped, and when his eyes are in a fog, when he can't see as far as from his cabin to the shore, then Hawkeye can open the door for the Hurons. And how will the plunder be divided? Why, Hawkeye, will carry away the most, and the Hurons will take what he may choose to leave behind him. The scalps can go to Canada, for a pale-face has no satisfaction in them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{following}} me {{and trying to}} defeat the object of my trip to Chicago. But you shall not do it. You pretend to be an ordinary traveller, but you {{are nothing more than}} a spy sent on by Mr. Aaron Woodward to stop me. But I have found you out, <b>and</b> now you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to him <b>and</b> tell him that his little plan didn't work." ...|$|R
5000|$|After World War II, many {{residents}} of the Lower East Side began moving to Brooklyn, Staten Island, eastern Long Island, and New Jersey. Chinese immigrants became an increased presence after the U.S. Immigration Act of 1965 removed immigration restrictions, and the Manhattan Chinatown to Little Italy's south expanded. In 2004, Tonelli said, [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> 30 years <b>and</b> find newspaper clips chronicling the expansion of Chinatown and mourning the loss of Little Italy." ...|$|R

You shall have your share of my money! Leave me alone and I swear it! You shall be rich! You <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Paris <b>and</b> be an adventurer no longer. You shall spend your own money. You can live your own life!" ...|$|R
