40|$|A {{specific}} anti-neutrophil antibody {{was recently}} described in primary sclerosing cholangitis and was detected using an indirect immunoalkaline phosphatase method. The present {{study examined the}} relationship of this antibody with respect to time, <b>clinical</b> activity, liver <b>biochemistry,</b> histology and ursodeoxycholic acid treatment. Fourteen patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis were followed up at regular intervals for 2 years. <b>Clinical</b> activity, liver <b>biochemistry,</b> histology and anti-neutrophil antibody titre were determined during the study period. A fluctuating course of the anti-neutrophil antibody was noted in both untreated patients and in those who were on ursodeoxycholic acid. This finding will have clinical implications if anti-neutrophil antibody is used to screen for potential primary sclerosing cholangitis in the future. The results suggest that several determinations of the antibody {{would need to be}} carried out over a period of time. No correlation was found between the antibody titre, <b>clinical</b> activity, liver <b>biochemistry</b> or histology.
