This {{is well known}} since the work of Lloyd and Topor about extended logic programming. Of course, formulas must be restricted {{in such a way}} that they can be effectively evaluated in finite time, and produce only a finite number of new tuples (in each iteration of the TP-operator: the fixpoint can still be infinite). It is also necessary to respect binding restrictions of built-in predicates: many of these predicates can be executed only when certain arguments are ground. Whereas for standard logic programming rules, questions of safety, allowedness, and range-restriction are relatively easy and well understood, the situation for general formulas is a bit more complicated. We give a syntactic analysis of formulas that guarantees the necessary properties. ...|$|R

The function a is discontinuous representing a well which oscillates in time.

40|$|In recent years, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest {{in the development of}} mining algorithms for data streams. Dealing with concept drift {{is one of the major}} challenges researchers are faced with when designing these algorithms. We propose a framework for mining k-CNF-expressions from a data stream. A k-CNF expression is a logical formula in conjunctive normal form, i. e., a <b>conjuction</b> <b>of</b> disjunctive clauses. k-CNF expressions play an important role in Computational Learning Theory where it has been shown that they are PAC-learnable [1]. We can thus derive theoretical bounds on the number of examples needed to achieve a given accuracy (with a certain confidence). We believe that these results can be used to detect and quantify concept drift and help us in finding the optimal settings for a window-based approach (related to [2]). Another benefit of CNF-expressions is that they are easy to understand. We can see them as logical constraints that hold on the data. Because they are logical formulas, we can reason with them in order to understand the dynamics of the concept drift and predict these dynamics on a higher level. This poster presents an incremental algorithm for mining k-CNF expres-sions from a data stream. We will mainly focus on the technical aspects of this algorithm and provide some experimental results...|$|R

Some types of contexts with such conjunction are discussed: sentences with co-ordinated parts, statements with similes, etc. Meaning conjunction {{in different parts of}} speech is studied; the combination in one word usage of free and phraseologically bound meanings; of usual and terminological meanings, of the dictionary word meaning and its semantic transformation in the poetic language. Special attention is paid to investigation of meaning conjunction of words of the same semantic class, based on the study of color adjectives. Adjectives red, purple, pink, blue and derivative verbs are discussed. In poetic metaphors and similes two menings of these words overlap: the direct meaning referring to the tenor and the figurative (personifying) meaning referring to the vehicle. The figurative meaning characterizes the color of human skin caused by some physical / emotional processes (not race). The conclusion is made that in such words in the literray text coincidence of the direct level of the text and its figurative level is established.

40|$|Shortened) Sequences of {{spectra of}} the nova-like cataclysmic {{variable}} (CV) BZ Cam were acquired on 9 nights in 2005 - 2006 {{in order to}} study the time development of episodes of wind activity known to occur frequently in this star. We confirm past results that the P-Cygni absorption components of the lines mostly evolve from a higher expansion velocity to lower velocity as an episode progresses. We also commonly find blueshifted emission components in the Halpha line profile, whose velocities and durations strongly suggest that they are also due to the wind. We suggest that the progression from larger to smaller expansion velocities is due the higher velocity portions of a wind concentration moving beyond {{the edge of the}} continuum light of the disk first, leaving a net redward shift of the remaining absorption profile. We also derive a new orbital ephemeris for BZ Cam, using the radial velocity of the core of the HeI 5876 AA line, finding P = 0. 15353 (4). Using this period the wind episodes in BZ Cam are found to be concentrated near inferior <b>conjuction</b> <b>of</b> the emission line source. This result confirms that the winds in nova-like CVs are often phase dependent, in spite of the puzzling implication that such winds lack axisymmetry. We argue that the radiation-driven wind in BZ Cam receives an initial boost by acting on gas that has been lifted above the disk by the interaction of the accretion stream with the disk, thereby imposing flickering time scales onto the wind events, as well as leading to an orbital modulation of the wind due to the non-axisymmetric nature of the stream/disk interaction.

40|$|The ten-year binary delta Sge (M 2 Ib-II+B 9. 5 V) is a zeta Aur binary {{containing}} an abnormally cool component. Combining {{our analysis}} of {{the system as a}} visual binary with Batten's radial-velocity solution leads to the following properties: i = 40 deg, a = 51 mas = 8. 83 A. U. = 1893 solar radius, hence d = 173 pc; M(sub B) = 2. 9 solar mass and M(sub M) = 3. 8 solar mass; and R(sub B) = 2. 6 solar radius and R(sub M) = 152 solar radius. This interpretation of the orbit places the M supergiant on the asymptotic giant branch. We have collected ultraviolet spectra throughout the star's 1980 - 90 orbit, concentrated around the <b>conjuction</b> <b>of</b> 1990. The wind of the M giant appears in these as narrow shell lines of singly ionized metals, chiefly Fe II, with P-Cyg profiles at many phases, which show the slow variation in strength expected for the orbit but no pronounced atmospheric eclipse. The terminal velocity of the wind is 16 - 18 km/s, and its excitation temperature is approximately 10, 000 K. Most of the broadening of the wind lines is caused by differential expansion of the atmosphere, with (unmeasurably) low turbulent velocities. Nontheless, the mass loss rate (1. 1 +/- 0. 4 X 10 (exp - 8) solar mas/yr) is almost the same as found previously by Reimers and Schroder for very different assumptions about the velocity structure. Also seen in the spectrum throughout the orbit are the effects of a variable, high-speed wind as well as evidence for accretion onto the B 9. 5 star. This high-speed wind absorbs in species of all ionization stages observed, e. g., C II, Mg II, Al III, SI IV, C IV, and has a terminaal velocity in the range 200 - 450 km/s. We presume this wind originates at the B dwarf, not the M supergiant, and speculate that it comes from an accretion disk, as suggested by recent <b>models</b> <b>of</b> magnetically moderated accretion. Evidence for accretion is redshifted absorption in the same transitions formed in the high-speed wind, as well as broad emission lines of singly ionized metals. This emission seems to be scattered out of the continuum of the B star. Finally, we discuss Auger ionization by accretion luminosity as the cause of the high ionization in these high-speed flows as well as the source of the extended circumstellar clouds of Si(3 +) and C(3 +) ions in zeta Aur binaries...|$|R

Futhermore, we observe a strong temperature dependance of the ripple velocity, calling for experiments at different temperatures. Also, we observe that the ripple velocity vanishes ahead of the periodic ripple pattern. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figures. Accepted for publication in Physical Review...|$|R
