40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the use of}} granodiorite, as fluxing agent in a body mix for {{stoneware}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> production, was assessed. Fourbatches were formulated using clay from Khaboba, and natural granodiorite from Saint Katherine, Sinai, Egypt. The batches weretailored to completely replace both feldspatic and inert components of stoneware <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles.</b> Densification was studied according toISO rules, while sinterability was estimated by optical dilatometry. The dependence of microstructure and mechanical properties ofstoneware <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> on granodiorite content was discussed. Strength measurements showed that increasing granodiorite content thebending strength of the bodies increased. In particular the studied batches {{can be used for}} the production of industrial fast firing <b>tiles.</b> The obtained <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> possess properties similar to commercial ceramic floor and/or wall tiles...|$|R

The station also uses acoustic ceiling tiles to reduce noise, in addition to using indirect lighting. The station is also compliant with National Fire Protection Association standards, despite its extreme depth, {{as it can be}} evacuated in six minutes in case of fire, and the platform can be cleared within four minutes.|$|E
5|$|Shin used archival {{photographs}} of the 2nd and 3rd Avenue Elevated train (El) to create compositions in <b>ceramic</b> <b>tile,</b> glass mosaic, and laminated glass. The imagery is manipulated and re-configured with each level having a different design. On the south east-corner entrance at Third Avenue, there are ceramic tiles depicting construction beams and the cranes that dismantled the El in the 1940s. At the mezzanine, a mosaic reveals the sky where the train had previously been present. The platform level features semi-transparent and reflective glass depicting vintage scenes of the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|The {{network has}} over 390 artworks by over 170 artists across its stations, ranging from {{historic}} murals to modern art. Styles also vary, from mosaic to fileteado, sculpture and installation pieces.

Featured artists include painters and reproductions by Quino, Molina Campos, Raúl Soldi, Rodolfo Medina and Jorge Schwarz. In addition, they provide spaces for music and theatre events, including an underground iteration of the Pepsi Music Festival on Line H.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is using self-cleaning TiO 2 photo catalyst in the making of <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> to decrease ammonium concentration and bacterium by determining the most appropriate percentage of TiO 2 towards the density, hardness, and bending strength on <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles,</b> degrading ammonium concentration and bacterium on the tiles on sintering temperature with the optimum percentage of catalyst volume variation. Result of the research shows that the best condition in making <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> is when the sintering temperature is 1100 oC, the best density is 15 % TiO 2 that is (2. 697 ± 0. 049) gram/cm 3, the best hardness and bending strength by adding 10 % TiO 2 (592. 594 ± 22. 518) Mpa and (1929. 696 ± 411. 54) Mpa, therefore the making of ceramic is using 1100 oC sintering temperature and adding 10 % TiO 2. The decreasing of the ammonium concentration on <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> by adding 10 % TiO 2 on sintering temperature of 1100 oC with 2 hours ray time is 65. 23 %. On glasured <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles,</b> degradation of E. Coli is 100 % with 3 hours ray time, while P. Aeruginosa and S. aureus are only degraded 9. 99 %. On non glasured <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles,</b> degradation of P. Aeruginosa is 100 % with 2 hours ray time, while E. coli dan S. aureus are only degraded 9. 99 % with 3 hours ray time. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> with 10 % added TiO 2 is very suitable for bathrooms or places with water that have the possibility of E. coli or P. aeruginosa contamination...|$|R

5|$|The Cooperativa Obrera Mataronense (Mataró Workers' Cooperative) was Gaudí's {{first big}} project, {{on which he}} worked from 1878 to 1882, for Salvador Pagès i Anglada. The project, for the cooperative's head office in Mataró, {{comprised}} a factory, a worker's housing estate, a social centre and a services building, though only the factory and the services building were completed. In the factory roof Gaudí used the catenary arch {{for the first time}}, with a bolt assembly system devised by Philibert de l'Orme. He also used <b>ceramic</b> <b>tile</b> decoration {{for the first time in}} the services building. Gaudí laid out the site taking account of solar orientation, another signature of his works, and included landscaped areas. He even designed the Cooperative's banner, with the figure of a bee, symbol of industriousness.|$|E

25|$|In the Byzantine period, domes were {{normally}} hemispherical and had, {{with occasional}} exceptions, windowed drums. All {{of the surviving}} examples in Constantinople are ribbed or pumpkin domes, with the divisions corresponding {{to the number of}} windows. Roofing for domes ranged from simple <b>ceramic</b> <b>tile</b> to more expensive, more durable, and more form-fitting lead sheeting. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed construction. The technique of using double shells for domes, although revived in the Renaissance, originated in Byzantine practice.|$|E

25|$|Although Londinium {{remained}} {{important for}} the rest of the Roman period, no further expansion resulted. Londinium supported a smaller but stable settlement population as archaeologists have found that much of the city after this date was covered in dark earth—the by-product of urban household waste, manure, <b>ceramic</b> <b>tile,</b> and non-farm debris of settlement occupation, which accumulated relatively undisturbed for centuries. Sometime between 190 and 225, the Romans built a defensive wall around the landward side of the city. Along with Hadrian's Wall and the road network, this wall was one of the largest construction projects carried out in Roman Britain. The London Wall survived for another 1,600 years and broadly defined the perimeter of the old City of London.|$|E

40|$|Delamination is {{a typical}} defect of <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles.</b> It {{originates}} from the presence of trapped air during pressing, and elastic recovery of the pressed material, which prevents the consolidation of the pressed material. Although delamination greatly reduces {{the quality of the}} final product, standard tests for <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> are not currently available. In this work the problem of detecting delamination of green and fired <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> is approached by using ultrasonic pulse velocity measurement, a non-destructive technique normally used to assess concrete structures and the density of <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles.</b> It was assumed that an increase in travel time for a given thickness (i. e., decrease in travel velocity) would indicate the presence of delamination, as the sound wave has to travels around the flat pore. The problems connected with measurement uncertainty and repeatability are discussed in the paper, in particular concerning the standardisation of the measurement. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
