40|$|The first {{successful}} complete neutron diffraction anomalous dispersion experiment has been performed {{to investigate the}} role of the Sm 3 + ions in the structure of vitreous Sm(2) O(3) (.) 4 P(2) O(5). The ideal form of this technique, which employs the wavelength dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the neutron scattering length close to an absorption resonance, is used and involves measurements at two pairs of wavelengths: the real part of the scattering length is varied, keeping the imaginary part constant, and then the imaginary part is varied, keeping the real part constant. If A denotes the element with the isotope (Sm- 149) having the absorption resonance and X any other element present in the sample, the first measurement can be used to extract the A-A + A-X or A-A + X-X contribution to the real space correlation function, T(r), and the second yields the A-A <b>component</b> <b>correlation</b> function. For the present glass, the Sm-Sm + Sm-X contribution (X = P or 0) reveals that the Sm 3 + ions have an average co-ordination number, n(Sm(O)) of 7, with a mean Sm-O bond length of 2. 375 +/- 0. 005 angstrom, while the anomalous difference correlation function indicates that the SM 3 + ions are similar to 4. 6 angstrom apart.

40|$|Abstract. Two {{characteristic}} seasons can {{be distinguished}} in the winds prevailing in Estonia: winter and summer. Summer {{is characterized by a}} periodical daily wind component at the coast {{as well as on the}} mainland. Filtering it out from the time series, the rest of the data can be considered as the random component of the wind velocity. The length of its correlation interval, about 10 h, determines the stability of the wind velocity. It is shown that data obtained at the height of 10 – 12 m with a 3 -h step is sufficient to establish the correlation interval. The average value of the wind velocity and its correlation interval depend more strongly on the season than on the location.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of reliability engineers and many researchers continue to base their models {{on the assumption that}} components fail in a statistically independent manner. This assumption is generally untenable because correlated failures can lower the reliability of a fault tolerant system. A simple method that quantifies the impact of correlation among the components of a system is needed to eliminate this widespread practice. Previous approaches to model correlated component failures have not gained popularity because they rely on excessively sophisticated mathematical approaches, making them cumbersome to apply in practice. This paper proposes a method to model the reliability of systems with correlated identical components, where the components exhibit the same average reliability and also possess a common failure correlation parameter. The method is applicable to the class of coherent systems commonly modelled by reliability block diagrams and fault trees. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through a series of examples, including the derivation of several commonly used structures such as the k-out-of-n and parallel systems. The examples illustrate how the method facilitates the assessment of <b>component</b> <b>correlation</b> on system reliability...|$|E

The hydrogel is suitable for biomedical applications and in particular as a biodegradable scaffold for tissue engineering. Since {{the structure of the}} hydrogel is critical to cell-material interactions, small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and ultra SANS (USANS) were used to examine the molecular conformation of chitosan chains and the larger scale microstructure. On the nanoscale, the hydrogel is described in terms of a static component (characteristic length, Xi) which accounts for the physical cross-links, and a dynamic <b>component</b> (<b>correlation</b> length, xi) which accounts for solution-like properties.

40|$|Various {{types of}} superfluid-insulator {{transitions}} are investigated for two-component lattice boson systems in two dimensions with on-site hard-core repulsion and the component-dependent intersite interaction. The mean-field phase diagram is {{obtained by the}} Gutzwiller-type variational technique in the plane of filling and interaction parameters. Various ground-state properties are also studied by the quantum Monte Carlo method. Our model exhibits two types of diagonal long-range orders; the density order around the density n= 1 / 2 and the Ising-type component order near n= 1. The quantum Monte Carlo results for the transitions from the superfluid state to these two ordered states show marked contrast with the Gutzwiller results. Namely, although they are both accompanied by phase separation into commensurate (n= 1 / 2 or n= 1) and incommensurate density phases, these transitions are both continuous. The continuous growth of the <b>component</b> <b>correlation</b> severely suppresses the superfluidity {{as well as the}} inverse of the effective mass in the critical region of the component order transition in contrast to the persistence of the superfluidity in the density-ordered state.
