40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} model is {{developed for the}} simulation of the pounding response {{of two or more}} adjacent buildings during earthquakes. The contact-impact problem is treated by the Lagrange multiplier method. The structures are modeled as multiple-degree-of-freedom systems with finite elements and with the possibility of contact between slabs or slabs and columns. Contact points are not known a priori, and are located through a searching procedure among the candidate contact surfaces. The dynamic equilibrium equations of <b>contact</b> <b>follow</b> an iterative formulation at each time step to account for the current contact conditions. With this three-dimensional idealization, the effect of various in-plan configurations of adjacent buildings as well as the induced deformations due to torsion during pounding are investigated for two real earthquake motions...|$|E
