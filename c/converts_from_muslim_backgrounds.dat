40|$|An {{increasing}} number of Muslims in the Arab world are being exposed to new ideas and questioning the beliefs of the community into which they were born. Several of these are choosing to embrace a Christian faith, a decision which can affect every aspect of their lives. Religious conversion usually entails a rejection of one's past: conversion out of Islam to a Christian faith can be construed by fellow Muslims as a betrayal not only of their religion, but also of family and of community. This thesis investigates the lives of <b>converts</b> <b>from</b> a <b>Muslim</b> <b>background</b> to a Christian faith, considering the strong social forces opposed to that decision. The difficulties of living as a religious convert in an Arab Muslim community can be understood in light of Arab cultural values which place community solidarity and reputation on {{a high level of}} importance. Muslim communal values, which usually have strong roots in the doctrines of unity and community, make apostasy from Islam especially problematic.

5000|$|In {{southern}} Albania, {{urban centres}} of central Albania and partially in northern Albania, {{the status of}} Christianity dominates in contrast to Islam which is viewed by some Muslim Albanians as a historic accident. A rejection of Islam has also been attributed to a divide that has opened up between older city dwellers and rural Muslim Albanian and somewhat conservative newcomers from the north-east to cities like Tiranë, where the latter are referred to pejoratively as [...] "Chechens". Some young Muslim Albanians educated in Islamic Universities abroad have viewed their role as defending Islam {{in the public sphere}} over issues such as wearing of the veil, organising themselves socially and criticised the Muslim Albanian establishment. Following the lead mainly of Albanian Christians obtaining visas for work into Greece there have been instances where Muslim Albanian migrants in Greece converted to Orthodoxy and changed their names into Christian Greek forms in order to be accepted into Greek society. While some other Muslim Albanians when emigrating have also converted to Catholicism and conversions in general to Christianity within Albania are associated with belonging and interpreted as being part of the West, its values and culture. A 2015 study estimated some 13,000 Christians exist in Albania who had <b>converted</b> <b>from</b> a <b>Muslim</b> <b>background,</b> though it is not clear to which Christian churches these people were affiliated. Among Albanians and in particular the young, religion is increasingly not seen as important. In a Pew research centre survey of Muslim Albanians in 2012, religion was important for only 15%, while 7% prayed, around 5% went to a mosque, 43% gave zakat (alms), 44% fasted during Ramadan and 72% expressed a belief in God and Muhammad. The same Pew survey also estimated that 65% of Albanian Muslims are non-denominational Muslims.|$|R
