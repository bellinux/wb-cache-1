25|$|Created in 1972 {{to replace}} a {{grouping}} within the Order of Canada, the order was established to recognize members of the Canadian Forces—either regular or reserve personnel—who have demonstrated dedication and devotion {{beyond the call of}} duty, achieving conspicuous merit and exceptional military service. The three tiers of the order are <b>Commander,</b> <b>Officer,</b> and Member; specific individuals may be given extraordinary and deserving non-Canadians granted with honorary appointment into each grade.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{refer to}} a {{military}} hierarchy, but in contrary Scouting has an anti-authoritarian streak. The Patrol leader is a leader, but should originally be elected {{by members of the}} patrol. About the Scoutmaster Baden-Powell [...] "stipulated that the position of Scoutmaster was to be neither that of a schoolmaster nor of a <b>commander</b> <b>Officer,</b> but rather that of an elder brother among his boys, not detached or above them individually". These are no military hierarchy.|$|E
2500|$|The self-governing of {{the boys}} changes {{the role of the}} leader: [...] "I had stipulated that the {{position}} of Scoutmaster was to be neither that of a schoolmaster nor of a <b>commander</b> <b>Officer,</b> but rather that of an elder brother among his boys, not detached or above them individually, able to inspire their efforts and to suggest new diversions when his finger on their pulse told him the attraction of any present craze was wearing off." [...] Scouting leaders should not direct, but guide (and check on safety).|$|E

2500|$|The Canadian monarch—presently [...] —is {{seen as the}} fount of honour and is thus at {{the apex}} of the Order of Military Merit as its sovereign, {{followed}} by the governor general—presently Julie Payette—who serves as the fellowship's chancellor, and the Chief of the Defence Staff—presently Jonathan Vance—who is the principal commander. Thereafter follow three grades—each having accordant post-nominal letters that are the same in both English and French. Additionally, any governor general, former governor general, or member of the Canadian Royal Family in the Canadian Forces may be appointed as an extraordinary <b>commander,</b> <b>officer,</b> or member. There are no limits to the population of any grade, and promotions are possible, though this is ordinarily not done within five years of the initial appointment. Any person thus honoured must return their lower grade insignia, as no member may at any time hold more than one appointment in the organization. Further, within the order of precedence for Canadian honours, each grade of the Order of Military Merit precedes a similar grade of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces, with commanders succeeding the members of the Order of Canada.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, captain Pellegrini {{had turned}} his ship to 200 degrees, heading to a point between the second and the third motor boats, namely MTB 313 and MTB 316. Scipione Africanos speed {{surprised}} the British, who were not fully prepared to fire their torpedoes until the Italian cruiser was just 1,500 yards away. The Italian warship started to fire all her armament in anger, with a precision that, in Pellegrini's own words, [...] "left him amazed". The Italian report claims that the engagement lasted {{no more than three}} minutes, and that the first enemy craft to be hit by 135mm rounds was the closest boat to starboard, which was left in a [...] "sinking condition". [...] The British unit was actually MTB 313, only 300 yards away from the Italian warship. The small vessel was ready to launch their torpedoes, when incoming fire injured her <b>commander</b> <b>officer</b> Alec Forster in a leg and mortally wounded the spare officer of the flotilla, sub-lieutenant John McKim. One of the torpedoes passed just ahead of its intended target. After this action, the damaged boat limped away. The other motor torpedo boat on the cruiser's starboard side was MTB 260, which thought to have scored a torpedo hit on the cruiser. After being engaged by gunfire from Scipione Africano, MTB 260 got away with minor damage. The Italian report says that she was set on fire.|$|E
