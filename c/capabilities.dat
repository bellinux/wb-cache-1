Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on GDP, utility, income, assets or other monetary measures, the <b>capabilities</b> approach focuses on what individuals are able to do. This approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central <b>capabilities</b> including life, health, bodily integrity, thought, and more. In recent years, the <b>capabilities</b> approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).|$|E

Service SMEs are facing the challenge of offering their customers continuously improved or completely new services and hence require service innovations to achieve and sustain competitive advantage. We used service value creation <b>capability</b> to assess service innovation <b>capability</b> of SMEs. Service value creation <b>capability</b> is a holistic approach which consists of Strategic <b>capability,</b> Managerial <b>capability,</b> Organizational <b>capability</b> and Adaptive <b>capability</b> to transform an SME into a value creation SME. It offers an overview of service value creation <b>capability</b> and activities against which service SMEs can critically reflect their service innovation performance. Our research primary focus is to explore and to find the relationship of service value creation <b>capability</b> with service innovation <b>capability</b> and to assess the service innovation by using a proposed model for service value creation <b>capability.</b> The model is empirically validated in Danish and Turkish SMEs to identify the correlation between the service value creation and service innovation through an integrated service value creation <b>capability</b> model analysis. The empirical data analysis reveals that there is strong positive correlation between the SME's service innovation <b>capability</b> and service value creation <b>capability</b> (strategic <b>capability,</b> managerial <b>capability,</b> operational <b>capability</b> and adaptive <b>capability)</b> ...|$|R

Thus, this study investigates the direct and interacting effects of IT <b>capability</b> and marketing <b>capability</b> on SCI. The hypothesised relationships were tested using survey data gathered from 329 firms in China’s manufacturing industry. The results reveal that both IT <b>capability</b> and marketing <b>capability</b> have a significant positive effect on SCI. Interestingly, no significant interaction effect was found, indicating that marketing IT <b>capability</b> and marketing <b>capability</b> influence SCI independently, and not synergistically. However, while IT <b>capability</b> and marketing <b>capability</b> do not interact, IT <b>capability</b> does mediate the impact of marketing <b>capability</b> on SCI...|$|R

40|$|Abstract - This paper reviews {{existing}} military <b>capability</b> {{models and}} the <b>capability</b> life cycle. It proposes a holistic <b>capability</b> life-cycle model (HCLCM) that combines <b>capability</b> systems with related <b>capability</b> models. ISO 15288 standard {{is used as}} a framework to construct the HCLCM. The HCLCM also shows how <b>capability</b> models and systems relate to each other throughout the <b>capability</b> life cycle. The main contribution of this paper is conceptual in nature. The model complements the existing, but still evolving, understanding of the military <b>capability</b> life cycle in a holistic and systemic way. The model also increases understanding and facilitates communication among various military <b>capability</b> stakeholders...|$|R

Since, process <b>capability</b> indices predict the <b>capability</b> of a process, {{they must have}} a significant relation with rate of rejects and losses. Studies showed that mostly process <b>capability</b> indices {{do not have a}} significant relation with rate of rejects or losses. Therefore, the loss-based indices are more appropriate and suitable indices to predict the <b>capability</b> of a process. In order to define a new loss-based process <b>capability</b> index, Taguchi loss functions were employed and this study proposed a novel process <b>capability</b> index called Taguchi-based Process <b>Capability</b> Index (TPCI). The methodology of this process <b>capability</b> index is based on standard rate of rejects for a capable process compared to other cases. Therefore, this study develops a new process <b>capability</b> index, which is Taguchi loss function-based and sensitive to losses. This new process <b>capability</b> index can provide a realistic and applicable metric to evaluate a process...|$|R

Finally, based on data from 213 firms in the Beijing area, the paper proves that these three innovative <b>capability</b> components are closely related to international competitiveness.

40|$|The <b>capability</b> {{approach}} is {{an approach to}} assessing well-being developed by Amartya Sen. Interest in this approach has resulted in several attempts to develop questionnaires to measure and value <b>capability</b> at an individual level in health economics. The methods of measuring and valuing <b>capability</b> used in the questionnaires are critically reviewed in this paper. It is argued that the methods used to measure <b>capability</b> result in a <b>capability</b> profile that is often an inaccurate description of the individual’s true <b>capability</b> set. In addition, existing methods of valuing <b>capability</b> do not consider that <b>capability</b> is a set, consisting of multiple combinations of functionings rather than a single combination, which means that existing methods of valuing <b>capability</b> may be inadequate. The difficulties in measuring and valuing <b>capability</b> faced by existing questionnaires means that using the <b>capability</b> approach in economic evaluations will require {{a significant amount of}} further research...|$|R

Product development <b>capability</b> and operational <b>capability</b> have different degrees of firm specificity in terms of the technological complexity of underlying resources. We further explore industry dynamism as an important moderating effect on the relationship between different types of innovation <b>capability</b> and market performance. Our findings suggest that,in the Chinese firms surveyed, both product development and operational <b>capability</b> in innovation positively contribute to market performance. The effect of operational <b>capability</b> is notably stronger than that of product development <b>capability.</b> We also confirm the complementary effect of operational <b>capability</b> with product development <b>capability</b> in enhancing market performance. Our findings further suggest that product development <b>capability</b> tends to have a stronger effect on market performance when the level of industry dynamism is low, while the impact of operational <b>capability</b> on market performance is stronger in industries with a relatively high level of dynamism...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine age {{differences}} in financial <b>capability.</b> Financial <b>capability</b> is measured by five variables: objective financial literacy, subjective financial literacy, desirable financial behavior, perceived financial <b>capability,</b> and a financial <b>capability</b> index. Financial <b>capability</b> is expected to increase with age. Specifically, we expect older consumers to demonstrate higher levels of both objective and subjective financial literacy, more desirable financial behaviors, a higher level of perceived financial <b>capability,</b> and a higher score on the financial <b>capability</b> index. Data from the 2012 National Financial <b>Capability</b> Study in the U. S. was used to examine the associations between age groups and financial <b>capability</b> variables. One-way ANOVAs were used to examine age differences in financial <b>capability</b> variables. Then multiple regressions were used to examine age differences after controlling for socio-demographic and financial variables. The results indicated that age differences in four financial <b>capability</b> variables showed similar patterns. Young adults aged 18 - 24 had the lowest scores on objective financial literacy, subjective financial literacy, perceived financial <b>capability,</b> and the financial <b>capability</b> index. The results have implications for consumer educators to provide effective financial education for all age groups. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved...|$|R
