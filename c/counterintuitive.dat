5|$|Special {{relativity}} {{has many}} <b>counterintuitive</b> and experimentally verified implications. These include the equivalence of mass and energy , length contraction (moving objects shorten), and time dilation (moving clocks run more slowly). The factorγ by which lengths contract and times dilate {{is known as}} the Lorentz factor and is given by , where v is the speed of the object. The difference of γ from 1 is negligible for speeds much slower thanc, such as most everyday speeds—in which case special relativity is closely approximated by Galilean relativity—but it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges to infinity as v approaches c. For example, a time dilation factor of γ=2 occurs at a relative velocity of 86.6% of the speed of light (v=.866c). Similarly, a time dilation factor of γ=10 occurs at v=99.5%c.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} view of hammerhead shark {{evolution is}} that species with smaller cephalofoils evolved first from a requiem shark ancestor, and later {{gave rise to}} species with larger cephalofoils. Under this interpretation, the winghead shark is the most derived hammerhead, as it has the most extreme cephalofoil morphology. However, molecular phylogenetic research based on isozymes, mitochondrial DNA, and nuclear DNA have found the opposite pattern, with the winghead shark as the most basal member of the hammerhead family. This result supports the <b>counterintuitive</b> idea that the first hammerhead shark to evolve had a large cephalofoil. It also supports the separation of Eusphyra from Sphyrna by keeping the latter monophyletic (including all descendants of a single ancestor). The winghead shark lineage is estimated to have diverged {{from the rest of}} the hammerheads some 15–20 million years ago during the Miocene.|$|E

25|$|Many {{consequences}} of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem seemed <b>counterintuitive</b> to logicians in the early 20th century, as the distinction between first-order and non-first-order properties was not yet understood. One such consequence is the existence of uncountable models of true arithmetic, which satisfy every first-order induction axiom but have non-inductive subsets. Another consequence that was considered particularly troubling is {{the existence of a}} countable model of set theory, which nevertheless must satisfy the sentence saying the real numbers are uncountable. This <b>counterintuitive</b> situation {{came to be known as}} Skolem's paradox; it shows that the notion of countability is not absolute.|$|E
25|$|This is a joke: {{although}} the three are all mathematically equivalent, many mathematicians find the {{axiom of choice}} to be intuitive, the well-ordering principle to be <b>counterintuitive,</b> and Zorn's lemma to be too complex for any intuition.|$|E
25|$|In April 2005, Charles Faulkner {{contributed to}} SFO {{magazine}} an article entitled, Inside the <b>Counterintuitive</b> World of Trend Followers: It's Not What You Think. It's What You Know. In this article, Faulkner examines a “trend-following philosophy” which he constructed after having observed the language patterns {{and behaviors of}} several top traders.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem is}} a paradox of the veridical type, because the correct choice (that one should switch doors) is so <b>counterintuitive</b> it can seem absurd, but is {{nevertheless}} demonstrably true. The Monty Hall problem is mathematically {{closely related to the}} earlier Three Prisoners problem and to the much older Bertrand's box paradox.|$|E
25|$|Motorcycles must be {{leaned in}} order to make turns. This lean is induced by the method known as countersteering, in which the rider {{momentarily}} steers the handlebars in the direction opposite of the desired turn. This practice is <b>counterintuitive</b> and therefore often confusing to novices and even many experienced motorcyclists.|$|E
25|$|Leopold Löwenheim (1915) and Thoralf Skolem (1920) {{obtained}} the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, {{which says that}} first-order logic cannot control the cardinalities of infinite structures. Skolem realized that this theorem would apply to first-order formalizations of set theory, and that it implies any such formalization has a countable model. This <b>counterintuitive</b> fact became known as Skolem's paradox.|$|E
25|$|The shear {{threshold}} requirement seems <b>counterintuitive</b> because increasing shear elevates {{the force}} applied to adhesive bonds {{and it would}} seem that this should increase the dislodging ability. Nevertheless, cells roll more slowly and more regularly until an optimal shear is reached where rolling velocity is minimal. This paradoxical phenomenon has not been satisfactorily explained despite the widespread interest.|$|E
25|$|Equidissections do {{not have}} many direct applications. They are {{considered}} interesting because the results are <b>counterintuitive</b> at first, and for a geometry problem with such a simple definition, the theory requires some surprisingly sophisticated algebraic tools. Many of the results rely upon extending p-adic valuations to the real numbers and extending Sperner's lemma to more general colored graphs.|$|E
25|$|However, {{since the}} Schrödinger {{equation}} is a wave equation, a single particle fired through a double-slit does show this same pattern (figure on right). Note: The experiment must be repeated many {{times for the}} complex pattern to emerge. Although this is <b>counterintuitive,</b> the prediction is correct; in particular, electron diffraction and neutron diffraction are well understood and widely used in science and engineering.|$|E
25|$|Truth {{tables for}} if-then {{statements}} identify four unique combinations of premises and conclusions: true premises and true conclusions; false premises and true conclusions; true premises and false conclusions; false premises and false conclusions. Strict conditionals assign a positive truth-value to every case except {{the case of}} a true premise and a false conclusion. This is sometimes regarded as <b>counterintuitive,</b> but makes more sense when false conditions are understood as objects of the mind.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} against the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of objects that may seem <b>counterintuitive.</b> One example is the Banach–Tarski paradox which {{says that it is}} possible to decompose the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotations and translations, reassemble the pieces into two solid balls each with the same volume as the original. The pieces in this decomposition, constructed using the axiom of choice, are non-measurable sets.|$|E
25|$|Electrodynamics {{of media}} with negative-index of {{refraction}} were first studied by a Russian theorist Victor Veselago in 1967. The proposed left-handed or negative-index materials were theorized to exhibit optical properties opposite {{to those of}} glass, air, and other transparent media. Such materials were predicted to exhibit <b>counterintuitive</b> properties like bending or refracting light in unusual and unexpected ways. However, the first practical metamaterial was not constructed until 33 years later and it does produce Veselago's concepts.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem that}} had not been solved was {{atmospheric}} reentry. It had been shown that an orbital vehicle easily had enough kinetic energy to vaporize itself, and yet it was known that meteorites can make it down to the ground. The mystery was solved in the US in 1951 when H. Julian Allen and A. J. Eggers, Jr. of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) made the <b>counterintuitive</b> discovery that a blunt shape (high drag) permitted the most effective heat shield. With this type of shape, around 99% of the energy goes into the air rather than the vehicle, and this permitted safe recovery of orbital vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Using these data, he {{quantified}} radical {{loss from}} particles, showing that simple diffusion theory {{could explain the}} results. Gilbert and his coworkers then revealed the mechanism for initiation in emulsion polymerisation by the entry of radicals into particles—in terms of fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic precepts—in a theory that clarifies the process as being through production of surface-active species in the water phase. This model produced various qualitative predictions. One prediction, that of {{the independence of the}} entry-rate coefficient of the size and surface properties of particles, was widely seen as <b>counterintuitive</b> because of the deep-rooted belief in models that he had shown to be wrong. Subsequently, this prediction was experimentally verified by Gilbert and others. He used the understanding from this knowledge to develop a priori models for particle formation and molecular-weight distribution.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} (but {{not universally}} accepted) solution {{is offered by}} the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics. According to this, not only is collapse of the wave function illusory, but the apparent random branching of possible futures when quantum systems interact with the macroscopic world is also an illusion. Measurement {{does not lead to}} a random choice of possible outcome; rather, the only ingredient of quantum mechanics is the unitary evolution of the wave function. All possibilities co-exist forever and the only reality is the quantum mechanical wave function. According to this view, two distant observers both split into superpositions when measuring a spin. The Bell inequality violations are no longer <b>counterintuitive,</b> because it is not clear which copy of the observer B will be seen by observer A when they compare notes. If reality includes all the different outcomes, locality in physical space (not outcome space) places no restrictions on how the split observers can meet up.|$|E
25|$|If the coated optic is used at non-normal {{incidence}} (that is, {{with light}} rays not {{perpendicular to the}} surface), the anti-reflection capabilities are degraded somewhat. This occurs because the phase accumulated in the layer relative to the phase of the light immediately reflected decreases as the angle increases from normal. This is <b>counterintuitive,</b> since the ray experiences a greater total phase shift in the layer than for normal incidence. This paradox is resolved by noting that the ray will exit the layer spatially offset from where it entered and will interfere with reflections from incoming rays that had to travel further (thus accumulating more phase of their own) {{to arrive at the}} interface. The net effect is that the relative phase is actually reduced, shifting the coating, such that the anti-reflection band of the coating tends to move to shorter wavelengths as the optic is tilted. Non-normal incidence angles also usually cause the reflection to be polarization-dependent.|$|E

[...] echo the floating, frameless engravings pioneered by Thomas Bewick in the 18th century, {{and yet they}} are startlingly modern. As much about form as they are about anatomical accuracy, they hover at the brink of typology but have nothing of zoological rendering's reduction to taxonomy.

500|$|In 1905, Einstein {{developed}} {{the theory of}} special relativity, which reconciled the relativity of motion with the observed constancy {{of the speed of}} light (a paradox of 19th-century physics). [...] Special relativity is now a core principle of physics. [...] Its <b>counterintuitive</b> predictions that moving clocks run more slowly, that moving objects are shortened in their direction of motion, and that the order of events is not absolute have been confirmed experimentally.|$|E
500|$|More generally, every nonzero {{terminating}} decimal has two equal representations (for example, 8.32 and 8.31999...), {{a property}} true of all base representations. The utilitarian {{preference for the}} terminating decimal representation contributes to the misconception {{that it is the}} only representation. [...] For this and other reasonssuch as rigorous proofs relying on non-elementary techniques, properties, or disciplinesmath students can find the equality sufficiently <b>counterintuitive</b> that they question or reject it. [...] This {{has been the subject of}} several studies in mathematics education.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the more}} {{surprising}} and, perhaps, <b>counterintuitive</b> (from a neo-Darwinian viewpoint) results of recent research in evolutionary developmental biology {{is that the}} diversity of body plans and morphology in organisms across many phyla are not necessarily reflected in diversity {{at the level of}} the sequences of genes, including those of the developmental genetic toolkit and other genes involved in development. Indeed, as John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner have noted, there is an apparent paradox: [...] "where we most expect to find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change". So, if the observed morphological novelty between different clades does not come from changes in gene sequences (such as by mutation), where does it come from? Novelty may arise by mutation-driven changes in gene regulation.|$|E
500|$|Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone {{called the}} track a [...] "striking departure" [...] in sound for Del Rey, and said its groove {{transformed}} her [...] "from chanteuse into frontwoman {{for a few}} glorious moments". In a review of Ultraviolence, Mike Diver of Clash {{said that in the}} context of the album, [...] "West Coast" [...] took on greater significance by serving as a fulcrum which balances the record into [...] "leaving a better impression than it otherwise might". Consequence of Sound's Sasha Geffen described the song as [...] "a <b>counterintuitive</b> gem" [...] and [...] "the sort of thing that rings beautifully from old car windows on hot summer evenings," [...] while Marissa G.

500|$|Reactance is the {{imaginary}} {{part of the}} complex [...] electrical impedance. [...] Both capacitors and inductors possess reactance (but of opposite sign) and are frequency dependent. [...] The specification that the network must be passive and lossless implies {{that there are no}} resistors (lossless), or amplifiers or energy sources (passive) in the network. [...] The network consequently must consist entirely of inductors and capacitors and the impedance will be purely an imaginary number with zero real part. [...] Foster's theorem applies equally to the admittance of a network, that is the susceptance (imaginary part of admittance) of a passive, lossless one-port monotonically increases with frequency. [...] This result may seem <b>counterintuitive</b> since admittance is the reciprocal of impedance, but is easily proved. [...] If the impedance is ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{he was an}} {{obstetrician}} {{rather than}} a pediatrician, DeLee became the greatest advocate of the infant incubator in the U.S. At that time, obstetricians dealt {{with the problems of}} the premature baby after birth, where pediatricians were likely to only see the survivors of prematurity many days later. The pediatricians – influenced by their experiences taking care of other types of malnourished children – thought it was essential for the babies to be exposed to sunlight. For most pediatricians, it seemed <b>counterintuitive</b> to enclose the babies in a box. By 1901, DeLee had built an entire incubator transport service staffed with specially trained nurses, but costs were high and maternity hospitals still did not attract many private patients. The funds ran out on the incubator station in 1908.|$|E
500|$|This {{objection}} {{is fundamentally}} an argument {{by lack of}} imagination, or argument from incredulity: a certain explanation is seen as being <b>counterintuitive,</b> and therefore an alternate, more intuitive explanation is appealed to instead. Supporters of evolution generally respond by arguing that evolution {{is not based on}} [...] "chance," [...] but on predictable chemical interactions: natural processes, rather than supernatural beings, are the [...] "designer." [...] Although the process involves some random elements, it is the non-random selection of survival-enhancing genes that drives evolution along an ordered trajectory. The fact that the results are ordered and seem [...] "designed" [...] is no more evidence for a supernatural intelligence than the appearance of complex natural phenomena (e.g. snowflakes). It is also argued that there is insufficient evidence to make statements about the plausibility or implausibility of abiogenesis, that certain structures demonstrate poor design, and that the implausibility of life evolving exactly as it did is no more evidence for an intelligence than the implausibility of a deck of cards being shuffled and dealt in a certain random order.|$|E
500|$|Allan Girdler and Glynn Kerr {{nonetheless}} still {{favor the}} Roper, even by Cameron's criterion. The reason, they say, {{is that it}} did in fact pioneer successful motorcycle technologies, including the twistgrip throttle control, and the frame geometry and engine placement used by the motorcycle {{as we know it}} today, while the Reitwagen was exceedingly crude, failing to employ the well understood principles of rake and trail to remain upright by movements of the front fork, and turn by leaning. Rake and trail are created by having the steering axis angled to varying degrees, rather than perfectly vertical, and by having the steering axis slightly offset, creating trail. This subtle engineering makes it possible for the rider to turn the bicycle or motorcycle by the <b>counterintuitive,</b> and typically unconscious, technique of countersteering, in which the handlebar is turned slightly to the left, causing the machine to lean to the right, and turning the vehicle to the right. Trail, also called fork offset, is an element contributing to the stability of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics, and the lack of it was one reason why the Reitwagen had to rely on two outrigger wheels to keep it from falling down, so it remained vertical and was steered much like a tricycle. David Burgess-Wise called the Daimler-Maybach test bed [...] "a crude makeshift", saying, [...] "as a bicycle, it was 20 years out of date." ...|$|E
500|$|Hill {{spent four}} months {{designing}} and seven months building another home-built dragster called the Double Dragon. The machine had two engines, with each engine having its own ring gear and pinion, clutch, and driveshaft. He used four rear racing slick tires in open competitions for faster passes, and two rear slicks in match competitions to produce smokier passes. The machine ripped up {{the starting line}} at the 1961 NHRA Nationals at Indianapolis. In 1962, Hill ran [...] two years after Chris Karamesines had the first [...] pass and two years before Don Garlits had the first official [...] rpass. A speed or e.t. record is first certified official after it is backed up by a different pass within one percent. Hill built his first Top Fuel dragster in 1963 using a Pontiac engine. He had nearly completed a jet-engine powered ultralight dragster in 1963 when the NHRA outlawed all aircraft engines. He built two more Top Fuel Hemi-powered dragsters before he had an engine fire at Green Valley Race City in 1966. [...] "It {{was one of those}} fireballs that you couldn't see through," [...] Hill said. [...] "I locked up the brakes, and it felt like I needed to turn the wheel to the left, but for some reason, I didn't. I had to do something that was <b>counterintuitive,</b> and it spooked me." [...] Hill had managed to steer straight down a course that was lined with trees. Hill had been using the Double Dragon to win matches, which were used to finance his Top Fuel dragster. The Double Dragon had been destroyed in a wreck two months before this fire. The fire tapped his finances and his resolve to drag race.|$|E
