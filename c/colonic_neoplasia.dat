40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{events that}} make colonic epithelial cells proceed along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence {{are not well}} understood. The phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway {{is involved in the}} regulation of cell growth and differentiation. To determine its role in <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasias</b> we performed mass measurements of its second messenger sn- 1, 2 -diacylglycerol in biopsy specimens from normal mucosa and neoplasias of the colon. Normal colonic mucosa was also investigated in patients without colonic abnormalities (n = 10). Compared with pooled diacylglycerol values from five colonic sites (100 %), values in patients with a normal colon were highest in the ascending colon (120 (5) %, p less than 0. 05) and lowest in the rectum (81 (5) %, p less than 0. 01). Absolute diacylglycerol values in patients with normal colons (2. 62 (0. 16) nmol/mg protein) were not significantly different from those found in the normal mucosa of patients with colorectal neoplasias (2. 45 (0. 17) nmol/mg protein). Both colonic adenomas (n = 15) and colorectal carcinomas (n = 14) showed significantly decreased diacylglycerol values compared with the adjacent normal mucosa of each patient (72 (4) %, p less than 0. 001, and 71 (4) %, p less than 0. 001 respectively). The appreciable decrease in mass diacylglycerol values clearly distinguishes adenomas and carcinomas of the colon from the surrounding normal mucosa. This finding suggests that profound metabolic changes of the phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway occur early in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and may be important in colonic carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is {{the third}} most common cancer in {{men and women and}} is also the third most common cause of cancer death. A large body of {{evidence}} points towards the possibility that bacteria can {{have a significant impact on}} the development of cancer. It has been suggested that Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, a group D streptococci, may play a role in the development of CRC. Sg, formerly S. bovis biotype I, has been shown to be highly associated with CRC. In observing patients with either Sg bacteremia or endocarditis it was found that 25 - 80 % of patients with Sg bacteremia had tumors and 18 - 62 % of patients with Sg endocarditis had <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasias.</b> However, other closely related Streptococcal strains, such as S. pasterianus and S. infantarius, have not been shown to have this strong association with CRC. In fact, it has been shown that biotype I is more often associated with CRC (94 %) as compared to biotype II (18 %). This knowledge has important clinical implications, and yet little is known about the role of Sg on CRC and the underlying mechanisms. Here we show that mice treated with Sg had significantly more tumors, higher tumor burden and dysplasia grade, and increased cell proliferation and Î²-catenin level in colonic crypts compared to mice treated with control bacteria. Sg strains that promoted proliferation were also more efficient at adhering to CRC cell lines and colonizing a mouse model. Additionally, in human patients Sg was highly prevalent in CRC patients and tumor tissues had an increased Sg burden in comparison to normal adjacent tissues. These results provide exciting new information and establish a tumor-promoting role of Sg that involves specific bacterial and host factors...|$|R

Human studies have associated the GH-IGF-I axis {{with the development}} of colorectal cancer; however, the question of whether colorectal cancer is a problem in acromegaly is currently unresolved. We performed a cross-sectional study to assess the risk of <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia</b> in patients with acromegaly.

A repeat colonoscopy was performed in 121 patients after a mean interval of 32. 1 months. Colonoscopic findings in patients with acromegaly were compared with those of 233 patients with nonspecific abdominal complaints who were referred for endoscopy during the study period. A total of 65 patients (27. 7 %) and 36 controls (15. 5 %) had <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> In 55 patients (23. 4 %) and 34 control subjects (14. 6 %), the most important findings were adenomas (odds ratio, 1. 7; range, 1. 1 - 2. 5), whereas 10 patients (4. 3 %) and two control subjects (0. 9 %) had carcinoma (odds ratio, 4. 9; range, 1. 1 - 22. 4).

40|$|Flexible {{sigmoidoscopy}} {{has been}} recommended as a screening method {{to reduce the}} incidence of colorectal cancer in asymptomatic, average-risk subjects through the early detection and removal of polyps. However, the association between distal and proximal <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and, hence, the requirement for colonoscopic follow up of screen-detected distal neoplasms is unclear. Our aims were: (i) to evaluate the risk of having proximal neoplasms in those with distal colonic neoplasms; and (ii) to determine whether the risk was dependent on the number, size, histology or morphology of the distal lesions. We prospectively evaluated asymptomatic subjects in a flexible sigmoidoscopy based screening programme. Those with rectosigmoid neoplasia underwent colonoscopy. The number, size, histology and morphology of the polyps were recorded. Advanced lesions were defined as adenomas > 1 cm or with a villous component or severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ or cancer. Adenomatous polyps were found in 17 % (135) of screening flexible sigmoidoscopies. At colonoscopy, up to 30 % of subjects with distal colonic neoplasms had synchronous proximal lesions at colonoscopy and up to 20 % had advanced proximal lesions. The risk of proximal <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia</b> was increased in those with distal sessile colonic neoplasms but appeared independent of distal lesion size, number or morphology. In conclusion, distal <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia</b> predicts proximal neoplasia in up to 30 % of subjects and these were advanced lesions in up to 20 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy is {{the gold}} {{standard}} exam to investigate patients with colonic complaints. However, its availability is limited in developing countries. Sigmoidoscopy has been advocated as a first procedure in colorectal cancer screening strategies, in order to select those who need colonoscopy. AIM: To study the correlation between distal and proximal <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasias</b> in symptomatic patients 50 years or older and patients 40 to 49 years old who underwent colonoscopy at a gastrointestinal endoscopy unit in 1999 and 2000 with the purpose to evaluate its role in a symptomatic population. METHODS: All colonoscopies performed in our Department in 1999 - 2000 were reviewed. The distal colon {{was defined as the}} colonic segment aboral to the splenic flexure. Advanced neoplasias were defined as adenomas larger than 10 millimeters and adenocarcinomas. RESULTS: Of the 2, 701 colonoscopies retrieved, 1, 125 were enrolled in this study. Prevalence rates for adenoma, advanced adenoma and carcinoma were 28. 9 %, 4. 6 % and 4 % in the group of 830 patients 50 years or older (mean age 65 years, 491 women). The finding of one small (< 10 mm) adenoma in the distal bowel doubled the likelihood of finding a proximal neoplasia (OR = 2. 12, 95 % CI, 1. 27 - 3. 54), and multiple (OR = 3. 99, 95 % CI, 1. 72 - 9. 28) or advanced (OR = 3. 73, 95 % CI, 1. 81 - 7. 7) adenomas increased this risk even further. Of the patients without adenoma or carcinoma in the distal colon, 1. 93 % had proximal advanced neoplasia. In the group of 40 to 49 -year-old patients (n = 395; mean age 44. 8 years, 208 women) the prevalence of adenomas (14. 9 %), advanced adenomas (3. 4 %), and carcinomas (1. 7 %) was lower. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of finding a proximal lesion is greater in patients with distal neoplasias. This likelihood is further increased when adenomas are multiple or larger than 10 mm. One out of 52 patients 50 years or older with an apparently normal distal colon has advanced proximal neoplasia. Sigmoidoscopy is not an adequate exam for symptomatic patients aged 50 years or older...|$|R
40|$|Zur Detektion von neuen potentiellen Biomarkerkandidaten fÃ¼r das KRK sowie dessen Vorstufen wurde Blutplasma von gesunden Kontrollen und von Patienten mit kolorektalen Adenomen und Karzinomen untersucht. Mit Hilfe immunoaffinitÃ¤ts-basierter ChromatographiesÃ¤ulen wurde das Blutplasma mit einer automatisierten Methode von hoch und moderat abundanten Proteinen entfernt und daraufhin massenspektrometrisch analysiert. HierfÃ¼r wurde eine labelfreie {{quantitative}} und datenunabhÃ¤ngige Methode angewendet. Nach Auswertung der Daten kristallisierten sich mehrere potentielle Biomarkerkandidaten heraus, wobei das Augenmerk auf solchen Proteinen lag, die sowohl bei Adenompatienten als auch bei Karzinompatienten vermehrt im Plasma vorlagen. Nach Western Blot Experimenten und einer weiteren Validierung mittels eines ELISAs an einem grÃ¶Ãeren Patientenset zeigte sich, dass die beiden Proteine AMBP und CRP als potentielle Biomarker zur Detektion von Adenomen und Karzinomen herangezogen werden konnten. Receiver Operating Charakteristik (ROC) -Analysen ergaben einen AUC-Wert von 0, 79 fÃ¼r AMBP und 0, 77 fÃ¼r CRP fÃ¼r das Erkennen von Adenomen und Karzinomen. Dies resultierte in einer SensitivitÃ¤t von 72, 5 % fÃ¼r AMBP bzw. 60 % fÃ¼r CRP bei einer SpezifitÃ¤t von 80 %. Durch die Kombination beider Markerproteine erhielt man sogar eine noch hÃ¶here SensitivitÃ¤t von 80 % bei 80 % SpezifitÃ¤t fÃ¼r das Aufdecken kolorektaler Neoplasien. Ebenso zeigte sich in der histochemischen Analyse, dass AMBP direkt von intestinalen Epithelzellen exprimiert wird. Currently available biomarkers for {{the detection}} of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) are of limited value {{for the detection}} of premalignant lesions in the colon prior to screening endoscopy. To identify novel plasma markers for colorectal adenomas, we purified low-abundance proteins from 30 plasma samples of healthy controls and patients with colonic adenomas/CRC. For the unbiased identification of potential biomarker candidates, we then applied a data-independent-acquisition based label-free quantitative proteomic approach. We could identify several upregulated proteins in fractionated plasma samples of adenoma and cancer patients. Western blot and ELISA analysis confirmed that the proteins AMBP and CRP were significantly increased in the plasma of adenoma and cancer patients compared to healthy controls. The area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0. 79 for AMBP and 0. 77 for CRP alone when <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasias</b> were compared to controls. This resulted in a sensitivity of 72. 5 % for AMBP and 60 % for CRP at a specificity of 80 %. For both proteins together an AUC value of 0. 85 could be achieved, which lead to a sensitivity of 80 % and specificity of 80 % for detection of colorectal neoplasias.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patients with {{acromegaly}} are {{at increased}} risk of developing colorectal carcinoma and premalignant tubulovillous adenoma. The pathogenesis of these neoplasms could involve a stimulatory effect of serum growth factors on colonic epithelial cell proliferation. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate changes in (1) serum IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP- 3 and IGFBP- 2 and (2) changes in local expression of IGFBPs and p 53 in colonic epithelium in patients with <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia</b> with and without acromegaly. DESIGN: A cross-sectional retrospective study was performed. Fasting serum samples were obtained at the time of colonoscopy for patients with acromegaly and at the time of surgery for patients with <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia</b> without acromegaly. MEASUREMENTS: Serum IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP- 2 and IGFBP- 3 were measured using specific immunoassays. Tissue expression of IGFBP- 2, IGFBP- 3 and p 53 status were determined by immunohistochemistry. PATIENTS: Group 1 : 26 age- and sex-matched control subjects (range 40 - 69 years); group 2 : 18 patients with acromegaly without <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia</b> (range 39 - 68 years); group 3 : 18 patients with acromegaly and <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia</b> (range 41 - 74 years, 11 = adenoma, seven = carcinoma); group 4 : 19 patients with <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia</b> without endocrine disease (range 43 - 91 years, four = adenoma, 15 = carcinoma). Immunohistochemical staining of colonic biopsies was performed for IGFBP- 2, IGFBP- 3 and p 53 in groups 3 and 4. RESULTS: Mean serum IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 levels were significantly elevated in group 2 (371 +/- 131 microg/l and 6. 5 +/- 1. 8 mg/l, respectively) and group 3 (379 +/- 174 microg/l and 5. 8 +/- 1. 6 mg/l, respectively), and significantly reduced in group 4 (103 +/- 36 microg/l and 2. 4 +/- 1 mg/l) compared to controls (165 +/- 40 microg/l and 4. 7 +/- 1 mg/l; P < 0. 0001, P < 0. 001, respectively). However, median serum IGFBP- 2 levels were significantly elevated in group 3 (P < 0. 01) and group 4 (P < 0. 0001). Immunostaining for IGFBP- 2 showed strong areas of immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of malignant colonic epithelium compared to benign epithelium. IGFBP- 3 immunostaining showed strong areas of immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of malignant and benign colonic epithelium compared to the normal epithelium. Nuclear staining for p 53 was observed in three patients from group 3 (two carcinoma, one adenoma) and four patients from group 4 (all carcinoma).

RESULTS: Twenty eight per cent of patients had advanced adenomas at index colonoscopy; 57. 8 % presented with low grade dysplasia neoplastic lesions and 14. 1 % had no adenoma at the first examination. The mean age was 59. 54 Â± 11. 74 years.

40|$|BACKGROUNDâPrevious {{reports have}} {{indicated}} {{an association between}} Barrett's metaplasia or adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia,</b> but the findings have been inconsistent. If true, such an association suggests common causal mechanisms. â¨AIMSâTo test the hypothesis of an association between Barrett's metaplasia or adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> â¨METHODSâA population based, retrospective cohort study was performed on all Swedish patients with colon cancer diagnosed between 1958 Â and 1992. Â  538 Â  500 person years at risk were reviewed among the 118 Â  030 patients in the cohort (average follow up 4. 6 Â years, median 2. 1 Â years). The standardised incidence ratio (SIR), {{the ratio of the}} observed to the expected number of incident oesophageal adenocarcinomas, was used as a measure of relative risk. The expected number was derived from the entire Swedish population. â¨RESULTSâEleven oesophageal adenocarcinomas were found during follow up in the cohort, as against 9. 5 Â expected (SIR= 1. 2; 95 % confidence interval 0. 6 - 2. 1). Analysis by latency intervals after diagnosis of colon cancer showed no trend towards increasing or decreasing risk over time. There were no important sex differences in relative risk. â¨CONCLUSIONSâResults provide no support for a common link between colon cancer and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Although the direct relation between colon cancer and Barrett's oesophagus was not looked at, a search for common aetiological factors or genetic defects may not be fruitful.

40|$|Abstracts Background The {{carcinogenesis}} of {{colorectal cancer}} {{has been accepted}} by {{a model for a}} cascade of genetic alterations, named the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. In order to elucidate the carcinogenesis of the colorectal cancer more clearly, the genetic abnormalies of the non-neoplastic mucosal epithelium of the colon and rectum should be investigated. It has been speculated that colonic Paneth cell metaplasia (PaM) is one of the pre-neoplastic mucosa of colonic cancer. Therefore, we studied the propria mucosa of the right colon with PaM from the standpoints of the frequency of the K-ras codon 12 mutations (K-ras), which is initial genetic abnormality in colorectal cancer, and the loss of heterozygosity of microsatellite markers (LOH-MS), which has a relationship to development of colorectal cancer. Methods Fifty-two regions with PaM histopathologically from 12 surgically resected right colon specimens were studied. DNA extraction of the colonic mucosa with PaM was obtained using a microdissection method, and the frequency of the K-ras of PaM was investigated by enriched polymerase chain reaction-enzyme linked mini-sequence assay, and the frequency of the LOH-MS (D 2 S 123, D 17 S 250 and D 5 S 346) of PaM was examined by high resolution fluorescenced labeled PCR primers. Results K-ras mutation was detected in fifteen regions among 52 PaM (28. 9 %). All mutations were a single mutation and GGT changed to AGT in eleven and GAT in four. LOH-MS were detected in twenty-one regions among 52 PaM (40. 4 %) (D 2 S 123 : 35. 4 %, 17 / 48 regions, D 17 S 250 : 13. 7 %, 7 / 51 regions, and D 5 S 346 : 0 %, 0 / 52 regions). No K-ras mutations and LOH-MS were detected in the controls (Colorectal mucosa with no PaM). Conclusions Colonic mucosa with Paneth cell metaplasia {{may be one of the}} pre-neoplastic mucosa in the development of the <b>colonic</b> epithelial <b>neoplasia.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Over-expression and {{abnormal}} intracellular {{location of}} {{the product of the}} oncogene c-myc in <b>colonic</b> dysplasia and <b>neoplasia</b> may be related to alterations in epigenetic mechanisms controlling the functioning of this gene. We have investigated the methylation patterns of the c-myc oncogene in human colorectal tissue representing various stages of dysplasia and neoplasia, including metastasis to liver, omentum and lymph node. Comparison of normal and neoplastic tissues from the same patient showed a decrease in methylation in a specific CCGG site in the third exon of c-myc through the progression from normal via dysplastic to neoplastic and metastatic tissue. Quantitative analysis revealed that in colonic adenocarcinomas an average of 66. 1 % and in metastatic deposits 83. 1 % of the myc gene DNA was hypomethylated at this site, as compared to a value of 9. 2 % in normal colonic mucosa. Adenomatous polyps showed an average value of 50. 5 % and hyperplastic polyps, 24. 8 %. The results suggest that partial hypomethylation of the c-myc gene third exon is associated with cell proliferation, and that deregulation of proliferation may be linked to the high levels of hypomethylation, presumably involving both copies of the gene in some cells, which occur at a relatively early stage in neoplastic progression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{incidence}} and mortality are higher in African Americans (AAs) than in Caucasian Americans (CAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) {{have been found}} to be dysregulated in <b>colonic</b> and other <b>neoplasias.</b> The aim of this exploratory study was to identify candi-date miRNAs that could contribute to potential biological differences between AA and CA colon cancers. Total RNA was isolated from tumor and paired adjacent normal colon tissue from 30 AA and 31 CA colon cancer patients archived at Stony Brook University (SBU) and Washington University (WU) âSt. Â LouisÂ MedicalÂ Center. miRNAÂ profiles were determined by probing human genome-wide miRNA arrays with RNA isolated from each sample. Using repeated measures analysis of variance (RANOVA), miRNAs were selected that exhibited significant (p 1. 5, p< 0. 05) main effects of race and/or tumor. Quantitative poly-merase chainÂ reactionÂ (qâPCR) Â  wasÂ usedÂ toÂ confirmÂ miRNAs identified byÂ microarrayÂ analysis. CandidateÂ miRNAÂ targets were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. RANOVA results indicated that miR- 182, miR 152, miR- 204, miR- 222 and miR- 202 exhibited significant race and tumor main effects. OfÂ theseÂ miRNAs,Â  qâPCRÂ analysisÂ confirmedÂ that miR- 182 was upregulated in AA vs. CA tumors and exhibited significant race:tumor interaction. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the levels of FOXO 1 and FOXO 3 A, two potential miR- 182 targets, are reduced in AA tumors. miRNAs may play a role in the differences between AA and CA colonÂ cancer. Specifically,Â  differencesÂ inÂ miRNAÂ expres-sion levels of miR- 182 may contribute to decreased survival in AA colon cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drugs have}} been accused of causing false positive results in faecal occult blood tests for colorectal cancer. A study was therefore performed in 10, 931 people undergoing faecal occult blood screening tests to assess the effect of these drugs on the predictive value of a positive test result. Those with a positive result were interviewed and a full drug history was taken before they underwent a full colorectal examination. Of the 455 people with a positive result, 50 were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: 10 (20 %) had <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> Of the 405 who were not taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 129 (32 %) had <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> These detection rates were not significantly different, and the predictive value of a positive result for an adenoma larger than 1 cm was 14 % in the group not taking anti-inflammatory drugs and 26 % in the group taking them (not significant). These results suggest that a finding of occult faecal blood cannot be attributed to upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and should be followed by a thorough colorectal examination...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{patients}} with Crohn's disease, {{the risk of}} small bowel adenocarcinoma is 20 - 40 {{times higher than the}} low background risk of the general population. In the subset of {{patients with}} longstanding small bowel lesions, the absolute risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma exceeds 1 per 100 patient-years after 25 years of follow-up and becomes equivalent to the risk of colorectal cancer. Growing evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of small bowel adenocarcinoma arising in inflammatory lesions of Crohn's disease {{is similar to that of}} colorectal cancer complicating chronic colonic inflammation (inflammation-dysplasia-cancer sequence). However, contrasting with the established endoscopic detection of <b>colonic</b> advanced <b>neoplasias</b> in patients with longstanding extensive colitis, there is no consensus at this time how to face the excess-risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma in patients at high risk. There are no specific clinical or imaging alert signs and endoscopic surveillance of the totality of the inflamed small bowel mucosa would suppose to perform repeated enteroscopies, with the potential limiting factor of stenosis. Very preliminary data suggest that chemoprevention with salicylates could be an alternative way for reducing the risk. Data from referral centers and from the CESAME cohort suggest that intestinal lymphomas may arise in the chronically inflamed segments in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Regarding nonintestinal lymphomas, it is now established that IBD patients treated with thiopurines have an excess risk of lymphomas, exhibiting in most cases pathological features of lymphomas associated with immunosuppression, including the frequent presence of EBV in neoplastic tissues. There is growing evidence that treatment with thiopurines is responsible by itself for this excess risk. IBD patients receiving immunomodulators, especially young men, are also at risk (0. 4 for 10, 000 patient-years in the CESAME study) for developing fatal early post-mononucleosis lymphomas, like in Purtilo's syndrome, maybe in association with a background genetic susceptibility. Finally, patients receiving thiopurines and/or TNF-inhibitors are at risk for developing fatal hepatosplenic T cell lymphomas, but this risk is low (no case in the CESAME study). Whether patients receiving a monotherapy with methotrexate and/or TNF inhibitors are at increased risk of lymphomas is not known. Concordant data suggest that women receiving immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for developing uterine cervix dysplasia and require closer surveillance. But it is not established whether the risk of uterine cervix cancer and basal and squamous cell skin cancers (that may be associated with chronic human papillomavirus infection) is increased in patients receiving immunomodulators...|$|R

Such field defects have been indicated in colon cancer. The molecular abnormalities that are responsible for a field defect in the colon should be detectable at high frequency in the histologically normal tissue surrounding a colonic adenocarcinoma or surrounding an adenoma with advanced neoplasia (well {{on the way to a}} colon cancer), but at low frequency in the colonic mucosa from patients without <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2) {{overexpression}} {{has been}} described in sporadic <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia,</b> but its role in ulcerative colitis (UC) neoplastic progression remains unexplored. Although the specific role of cyclooxygenase in <b>colonic</b> <b>neoplasia</b> is uncertain, its inhibition by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decreases the risk of sporadic colonic adenocarcinoma and causes regression of adenomas in familial adenomatous polyposis. To investigate the role of COX- 2 in UC-associated neoplasia, we assessed COX- 2 protein and mRNA expression throughout the spectrum of UC-associated neoplastic lesions in four total colectomy specimens, using immunocytochemistry and a novel TaqMan reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. The findings were correlated with DNA ploidy and inflammatory activity. We found COX- 2 overexpression throughout the neoplastic spectrum in UC (P < 0. 0001, R 2 = 0. 53), even in diploid samples that were negative for dysplasia. Overall, neoplastic change explained 53 % {{of the variation in}} COX- 2 expression, whereas inflammatory activity explained only 11 %. COX- 2 was overexpressed in all aneuploid samples and in 38 % of diploid samples (P = 0. 0074). cDNA representational difference analysis was also performed and revealed that COX- 2 mRNA was an up-regulated cDNA representational difference analysis difference product. COX- 2 overexpression occurs early in UC-associated neoplasia, and the increase cannot be explained by inflammatory activity alone. The data suggest that COX- 2 -specific inhibitors may have a chemopreventative role in UC but the possibility that they could exacerbate UC inflammatory activity needs to be tested...|$|E
