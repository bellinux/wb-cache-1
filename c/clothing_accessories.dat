25|$|Slave {{labor was}} vital to Poplar Forest’s {{economic}} success. Beginning in 1790, the slaves at Poplar Forest initially grew tobacco and livestock for profit, and later began growing wheat. Records from Edward Hutter's tenure at Poplar Forest show that slaves were regularly tasked with tilling fields and digging ditches {{in addition to}} their work growing and harvesting plants to be sold at market. Slaves worked six days each week, and were also responsible for constructing and maintaining their housing structures. Scholars have determined that the enslaved community at Poplar Forest devised a commerce system amongst themselves; slaves were allowed a small plot of land with which to grow food and produce goods that could be traded or sold to fellow slaves as well as the owners' families and the outside market. Archaeologists at Poplar Forest have uncovered <b>clothing</b> <b>accessories</b> such as buttons, glass beads, gilt chains, aiglet/lace tips, and fancy buckles that were likely used as currency amongst slaves at Poplar Forest and the surrounding plantations.|$|E

500|$|According to Kurdt Horedt, István Bóna {{and other}} historians, Dridu B pottery {{unearthed}} in the Alba Iulia region which {{was similar to}} ceramic utensils found along the lower Danube demonstrates that the Bulgarians expanded their authority over this region.
