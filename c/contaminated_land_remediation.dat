Unfortunately, Malaysia is not unaffected by this issue and thus requires intervention in terms of tightening of legislation regarding contaminated land as well as application of established remediation technologies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Site {{investigation}} as {{the first}} stage of <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> <b>remediation</b> is an interdisciplinary, resource demanding operation that involves processes and activities from different fields, encompassing a wide range of professional expertise. Site investigation is a critically important stage as the findings provide the basis of any decision making, and as such any problems not dealt with at this stage affects the effectiveness of the whole remedial process. In this stage, Decision Support Systems as an emerging concept in geo-environmental projects provides a framework that helps deal with the uncertainties, complexities, non-linearities and potential risks, especially with their multiple and sometimes conflicting criteria. In this paper, a review of Decision Support Systems and the roles they have played in geo-environmental engineering will be explored. ...|$|E

40|$|Cement {{can be used}} as {{a binder}} for <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> <b>remediation</b> by {{reducing}} the leachability of contaminants. The contaminated soils can achieve a higher strength after cement solidification/stabilization process. However, contaminants in soils may interfere with the process of cement hydration, and lead to a more complicated strength development than conventional cemented soils. For soils contaminated by different types of heavy metals, the cement stabilized products may have different strength properties since heavy metals in the soils would influence the extent of chemical fixation among cement, soil, and contaminants mixtures. This paper presents an experimental study on the unconfined compressive strength of cement stabilized/solidified soils contaminated by lead, copper, and lead-copper mixture. The control samples (cement treated soils without any heavy metals) are also prepared for comparison purpose. The test results show that the presence of heavy metals in soils interferes with the cement hydration process, which is directly reflected by the variation in the strength development of samples. It is found that the types of heavy metal, the metal concentration, and the cement content are main factors which affect the cement hydration and strength...|$|E

40|$|As a {{developing}} country, Thailand {{has a significant}} issue with <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> and its <b>remediation.</b> Increasing levels of industrial and urban pollution, indiscriminate use of agrichemicals and poorly regulated disposal {{of a wide variety}} of hazardous wastes are putting a significant level of pressure on Thailand’s ecosystems. There is an urgent need for practical tools to assist with ecological risk assessment of <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> in Thailand. Reliance on soil criteria developed for overseas conditions and organisms may provide inadequate protection in Thailand where both soil and ecological receptors are, in many cases, unique to this country. Native soil organisms in Thailand may be more or less sensitive to contaminants compared to overseas test species. Therefore, standardised protocols for evaluating biodiversity and toxicity are being developed using native species with the aim of using locally generated data to better evaluate the ecological risks of contaminants in Thailand. This paper describes a biological indicator approach for ecological risk assessment of <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> in Thailand. This research found that ecotoxicological assessment provides a better basis for understanding the ecological impacts that contaminated sites cause under Thai environmental conditions. Thai soil invertebrate species were more sensitive to soil contaminants than similar species overseas. Different soil types from within Thailand also had an influence on the toxicity of contaminants to soil invertebrates. This study suggested that the collembolan, Cyphoderus sp. should be a useful alternative test species and more ecologically relevant to toxicity testing of Thai soils than the international test species, Folsomia candida. Soil biodiversity and functionality assessments also represent useful tools to assess <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> in Thailand. The data generated by this study will provide useful information for the pollution control authorities to assist with adequate protection and management of soil quality in Thailand...|$|R

40|$|PAHs are {{a common}} problem in {{contaminated}} urban soils due to their recalcitrance. This study presents results on the oxidation of anthracene on synthetic and natural Mn oxide surfaces. Evaporation of anthracene spiked Mn oxide slurries in air results in the oxidation of 30 % of the anthracene to anthraquinone. Control minerals, quartz and calcite, also oxidised a small but {{significant proportion of the}} anthracene (4. 5 % and 14 % conversion, respectively) when spiked mineral slurries were evaporated in air. However, only Mn oxide minerals showed significant anthracene oxidation (5 - 10 %) when evaporation took place in the absence of oxygen (N 2 atmosphere). In the fully hydrated systems where no drying took place, natural Mn oxides showed an increase in anthracene oxidation with decreasing pH, with a conversion of 75 % anthracene at pH 4. These results show both acidification and drying favor the oxidation of anthracene on Mn oxide mineral surfaces. It has also been demonstrated that non-redox active mineral surfaces, such as calcite, {{may play a role in}} contaminant breakdown during wetting and drying sequences.

40|$|Sustainability is {{becoming}} {{a very important issue}} in <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> <b>remediation</b> and should form one of the factors used in future selection of treatment technologies. In situ stabilisation/solidification (S/S) is a remediation technique that is increasingly being applied to the treatment of contaminated sites because of numerous advantages over other remediation techniques. This paper assesses and compares aspects of the technical sustainability of in situ S/S with landfilling. Criteria previously established for the assessment of the technical sustainability of the remediation of contaminated land are employed. The comparison is presented {{in the form of a}} case study based on a real remediation project in the UK. The analysis indicated that landfilling had a larger impact than S/S in the majority of areas investigated, such as waste production (1000 kg waste/t soil remediated for landfilling compared to none for S/S), transportation (12. 9 km/t for landfilling, 0. 4 km/t for S/S) and use of raw materials (1005. 5 kg/t for landfilling, 88. 9 kg/t for S/S), although S/S had high greenhouse gas emissions (12. 6 kg/t for landfilling, 40. 9 kg/t for S/S).

40|$|AbstractThe {{scale of}} land-contamination problems, {{and of the}} {{responses}} to them, makes achieving sustainability in <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> <b>remediation</b> an important objective. The Sustainable Remediation Forum in the UK (SuRF-UK) was established in 2007 to support more sustainable remediation practice in the UK. The current international interest in ‘sustainable remediation’ has achieved a fairly rapid consensus on concepts, descriptions and definitions for sustainable remediation, which are now being incorporated into an ISO standard. However the sustainability assessment methods being used remain diverse {{with a range of}} (mainly) semi-quantitative and quantitative approaches and tools developed, or in development. Sustainability assessment is site specific and subjective. It depends on the inclusion {{of a wide range of}} considerations across different stakeholder perspectives. Taking a tiered approach to sustainability assessment offers important advantages, starting from a qualitative assessment and moving through to semi-quantitative and quantitative assessments on an ‘as required’ basis only. It is also clear that there are a number of ‘easy wins’ that could improve performance against sustainability criteria right across the site management process. SuRF-UK has provided a checklist of ‘sustainable management practices’ that describes some of these. This paper provides the rationale for, and an outline of, and recently published SuRF-UK guidance on preparing for and framing sustainability assessments; carrying out qualitative sustainability assessment; and simple good management practices to improve sustainability across contaminated land management activities...|$|E

Plant availability of soil metals are often manipulated by additions of chelating agents. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to evaluate the effects of chelator and ligands on phytoextraction of Cd from contaminated soils with an endemic plant, Artemisia princeps var. orientalis. Cadmium content in the plant was highest in (NH 4) 2 SO 4 treatment, but sulfur powder had little effect on Cd accumulation in the plant due to low buffering capacity of the soil and slow turnover rate of S° to SO 4 2 ¯. Cadmium content in the plant was slightly increased in oxalic acid and EDTA treatments by accompanying pH decrease in the soil. Phytoremediation Index (PI) increased in the order of control<sulfur powder (S°) <oxalic acid<(NH 4) 2 SO 4 < EDTA treatments. In addition, Cd content in the plant showed the same trend with PI except for EDTA treatment. It could be postulated that EDTA addition should be avoided for the soil with high Cd availability as it might accelerate a continuous leaching of Cd-EDTA complexes from surface to subsoil during the phytoextraction. Overall results indicated that (NH 4) 2 SO 4 can be used to enhance Cd accumulation in the Artemisia princeps var. orientalis during phytoextraction...|$|E

During the last 10 years, several instances have emerged in which a life cycle approach has been applied to the remediation of contaminated sites. Besides addressing the environmental impact of the remediation activities for a specific site, attention should also be paid to the consequence of reintroducing a remediate site into the economy. From a legal point of view, there should be ways to encourage the use of sustainable remediation technologies, together with a disconnection of treated soils from the definition of waste.

While this was calibrated with over forty genuine environmental scenarios, its application to genuine fieldscale operations was more limited.

In this case the ameliorant calcium polysulphide out-performed the other solid matrices investigated. The commercial sponsor of the project was Remedios Limited who have pioneered the development and environmental applications of microbial biosensors. This project served to audit the current performance of biosensors and consider their future potential.

Once test driven, the tiered approach was effective at clearly justifying the best remedial option available.

40|$|<b>Contaminated</b> <b>land</b> {{management}} {{has become a}} major concern for Nigeria. Sites affected by petroleum hydrocarbons from oil exploitation activities have been identified as a major environmental and socio-economic problem in the Niger Delta region. Though air and water regulations have received the most attention, the regulatory system for <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> remains largely undeveloped. As a result, Nigeria oil <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> governance lacks a clear and well-established policy framework; administrative structure and capacity; technical methods; and incentive structures. A consequence of these limitations is the inevitable ad hoc management of <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> in Nigeria. This thesis aims to provide a comprehensive and integrated <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> management policy framework for Nigeria. This work adopts a qualitative approach including critical review methodology and field surveys to investigate the current practice in <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> management in Nigeria. Key findings from this research clearly indicate an urgent need for a regulatory policy supported by a holistic and coordinated structure, coupled with improved technical capacity and additional resources to prevent new contamination and to address legacy contaminated sites. A technical strategy to identify and characterise <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> in terms of Source-Pathway-Receptor (S-P-R) linkages, a liability regime and the establishment of land use standards are required in Nigeria. Field surveys were used to pilot a proposed stakeholder engagement approach that integrates consideration of social values that could influence <b>contaminated</b> <b>land</b> management policy. Top ranked social values included drinking water, soil quality, and food and local supply chain. Based on this research a pathway for improving the current policy was proposed.
