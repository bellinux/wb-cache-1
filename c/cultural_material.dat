500|$|The {{main issue}} for the party was Flemish nationalism, and most issues that were added later, were in some way also {{connected}} to this. The Flemish nationalism promoted by the party (volksnationalisme) was according to its program [...] "based on the ethnic community being a naturally occurring entity whose <b>cultural,</b> <b>material,</b> ethical and intellectual interests need to be preserved." [...] While the party primarily worked for an independent Flemish state (modeling the split on that of Czechoslovakia), {{it for a long}} time also promoted the idea that the new state should merge with the Netherlands, and establish a Dutch-speaking federation (Greater Netherlands). From the 1990s however, the latter idea was downplayed by the party, as the Netherlands then turned into a [...] "permissive, multicultural and social-democratic state" [...] according to one scholar (although this Dutch political situation would be sharply overturned in the 2000s).|$|E

500|$|Khachaturian {{is widely}} {{known for his}} use of folk songs of various ethnic groups in his compositions, most notably those of Armenians. Despite not having been born in Armenia, Khachaturian was [...] "essentially an Armenian {{composer}} whose music exhibits his Armenian roots". [...] "any of his compositions evoke an Armenian melodic line. However, his works markedly differed from the conventional orchestrations of folk themes," [...] writes Rouben Paul Adalian. He suggests that Khachaturian's works carry [...] "the vibrant rhythms and stirring pace of Caucasian dance music", {{but at the same}} time are [...] "original compositions that reworked that <b>cultural</b> <b>material</b> through new instrumentation and according to European musical canons, resulting in a sound unique to the composer". He was particularly influenced by the folk-song collector, musicologist Komitas, and composers Alexander Spendiaryan and Romanos Melikian. Khachaturian acknowledged that Komitas [...] "singlehandedly laid the foundations for Armenia's classical tradition". In a 1969 article about Komitas, Khachaturian called him his [...] "greatest teacher".|$|E
500|$|Göring was {{appointed}} Reich Master of the Hunt in 1933 and Master of the German Forests in 1934. He instituted reforms to the forestry laws and acted to protect endangered species. Around {{this time he}} became interested in Schorfheide Forest, where he set aside [...] as a state park, which is still extant. There he built an elaborate hunting lodge, Carinhall, in memory of his first wife, Carin. By 1934, her body had been transported to the site {{and placed in a}} vault on the estate. The main lodge had a large art gallery where Göring displayed works that had been plundered from private collections and museums around Europe from 1939 onward. Göring worked closely with the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce), an organisation tasked with the looting of artwork and <b>cultural</b> <b>material</b> from Jewish collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe. Headed by Alfred Rosenberg, the task force set up a collection centre and headquarters in Paris. Some 26,000 railroad cars full of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France alone. Göring repeatedly visited the Paris headquarters to review the incoming stolen goods and to select items to be sent on a special train to Carinhall and his other homes. The estimated value of his collection—numbering some 1,500 pieces—was $200 million.|$|E

Circulating Cultures crosses disciplinary boundaries, with contributions from historians, musicologists, linguists and dance historians, to depict shifts of <b>cultural</b> <b>materials</b> through time, place and interventions from people. It looks at the way Indigenous and non-Indigenous performing arts have changed through intercultural influence and collaboration.  ...|$|R

2500|$|The Middle Woodland natives {{most likely}} built the Pinson Mounds {{primarily}} for religious ceremonial purposes, although their motives {{have yet to}} be established definitively. The Ozier Mound contains no burials and because of its shape, ramped and flat-topped, it was most likely used as a ceremonial platform. It {{is one of the oldest}} such mounds in the Eastern Woodlands region. At least three of the mounds 6, 12, and 31 contain burials or cremations. [...] Excavations have turned up a relatively scant amount of <b>cultural</b> <b>material</b> (e.g., arrowheads and pottery fragments), which points to a lack of permanent habitation at the Pinson Mounds site.|$|E

Exports from La Tène cultural areas to the Mediterranean cultures were based on salt, tin, copper, amber, wool, leather, furs and gold. [...] Although the La Tène culture had no writing of its own (rare examples of it using Greek inscriptions exist, and late Celtic coinage often uses Latin) there are several accounts of the culture and aspects of its history from classical authors, most very hostile and tending to stereotype.|$|E

2500|$|Despite such state {{government}} actions many local {{governments in the}} south-west have developed [...] "compacts" [...] or [...] "commitments" [...] with their local Noongar communities to ensure that sites of significance are protected and that the culture is respected. At the same time, the Western Australian Barnett government, also from November 2014, had been forcing the Aboriginal <b>Cultural</b> <b>Material</b> Committee to deregister 300 Aboriginal sacred sites in Western Australia. Although falling most heavily upon Pilbara and Kimberley sites this government policy also was having an impact upon Noongar lands according to Ira Hayward-Jackson, Chairman of the Rottnest Island Deaths Group. The changes also removed rights of notification and appeal for traditional owners seeking to protect their heritage. A legal ruling on 1 April 2015 overturned the government's actions {{on some of the}} sites deregistered which were found to be truly sacred.|$|E

Both Negulescu and Teohari Antonescu, the archaeologist, were moved there in a bid to ensure Junimea control over the university, and to consolidate the conservative circles of Iași, against a rising tide of socialist influence. Although he found the city [...] "repulsive" [...] and a [...] "place of exile", Negulescu accepted his appointment as a political and cultural mission. He was soon disappointed by the local Junimea branch and its president, N. Volenti, asking Maiorescu to send them better <b>cultural</b> <b>material.</b> In these early years, Negulescu was heavily indebted to Maiorescu's influence, down to oratory: he was known (and ridiculed) for copying Maiorescu's speech mannerisms.

2500|$|Though {{evolutionary}} psychology has traditionally focused on individual-level behaviors, determined by species-typical psychological adaptations, considerable {{work has been}} done on how these adaptations shape and, ultimately govern, culture (Tooby and Cosmides, 1989). Tooby and Cosmides (1989) argued that the mind consists of many domain-specific psychological adaptations, some of which may constrain what <b>cultural</b> <b>material</b> is learned or taught. As opposed to a domain-general cultural acquisition program, where an individual passively receives culturally-transmitted material from the group, Tooby and Cosmides (1989), among others, argue that: [...] "the psyche evolved to generate adaptive rather than repetitive behavior, and hence critically analyzes the behavior of those surrounding it in highly structured and patterned ways, {{to be used as a}} rich (but by no means the only) source of information out of which to construct a 'private culture' or individually tailored adaptive system; in consequence, this system may or may not mirror the behavior of others in any given respect."

Students {{will benefit from}} the Centre for <b>Cultural</b> <b>Materials</b> Conservation’s strong industry links and will gain access to the University of Melbourne’s vast and varied cultural collections, including the Ian Potter Museum of Art, and the University’s library, archive and school collections. Students will also have access to industry links with leading museums, galleries, archives and libraries, across Australia and overseas, with opportunities to develop research in relation to broader issues of cultural preservation for communities and cultures within the Asian-Pacific region. The option to specialise in areas including conservation treatment of paintings, works on paper, frames, and some object and architectural conservation, can be combined with an internship. In consultation with an academic supervisor, students can arrange to undertake a placement in a conservation department or practice, which deals directly in the conservation of materials of their specialisation. Students have the opportunity to undertake internships across Australia, and overseas (for example, in the UK, USA, New Zealand, India, Malaysia, Greece and East Timor).|$|R
