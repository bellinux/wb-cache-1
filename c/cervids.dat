40|$|Graduation date: 1994 The {{relationships}} between black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) and Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) herbivory and understory vegetation in unmanaged forests in Olympic National Park were studied from 1985 - 1989. From 1985 to 1986 I studied {{the impact of}} <b>cervid</b> exclusion on shrub, fern, and forb forage quality, tannin content, tannin astringency, shrub morphology, and shrub standing crop biomass, in old-growth and seral forests. Long-term protection from <b>cervid</b> herbivory {{had little effect on}} forage quality, tannin content, or tannin astringency. However, herbivory reduced leaf area, leaf weight, and plant standing crop biomass. From March 1987 through March 1989 I measured the amount of <b>cervid</b> herbivory in the understory of old-growth forests, and the effects of that herbivory on herb, fern, and shrub biomass, production, and nutrient content. The amount, timing, and impacts of <b>cervid</b> herbivory varied among understory plant communities, plant species, and years. Forage biomass, production, herbivory, and the influence of herbivory, were greatest in areas with grass-dominated understories. In those sites, production was either stimulated or not affected by herbivory, and herbivory altered plant structure and nutrient content such that foraging efficiency was improved during both summer and late winter. In sites with a forb-moss herb layer, biomass, production, and herbivory were less. Although herbivory either stimulated or had no effect on production in forb sites, it had no effect on forage nutrient content or structure, and thus did not impact foraging efficiency. The effects of long-term exclusion of ungulates in the study area indicated that soon after exclusion, grass-dominated understories disappear. Thus, <b>cervid</b> herbivory was found to influence understories in old-growth forest on several spacial and temporal scales. In the short-term, <b>cervid</b> herbivory improved forage structure and nutrient concentration in grass dominated understories. In the long term, <b>cervid</b> herbivory maintained grass dominated patches within the system. On both temporal and spatial scales, the net result of <b>cervid</b> herbivory was the creation of a more favorable foraging environment for both deer and elk...|$|R
30|$|What is {{the ancient}} centromeric DNA of mammals? The {{question}} remains unanswered {{in most cases}} because of considerably diverse centromeric DNA among species from lower to higher organisms and uncompleted sequencing of the centromeric/pericentromeric regions. Additionally, the centromeric region of chromosomes in most mammals is usually too small to dissect the chromosome localization of centromeric and pericentromeric DNA by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) study. The centromeric/pericentromeric region of the Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak vaginalis; barking deer) chromosome X[*]+[*] 3 is known to be exceptionally huge and compound in nature (Brinkley et al. [1984]) and may be composed of many different satellite DNA families (including functional centromeric and non-functional centromeric satellite DNAs as well as new and old satellite DNAs). Indeed, <b>cervid</b> satellite I (an old <b>cervid</b> satellite DNA) (Lee et al. [1994]; Lin et al. [1991]), <b>cervid</b> satellite II (a functional centromeric satellite DNA) (Vafa et al. [1999]; Li et al. [2000 b]), and <b>cervid</b> satellite IV (Li et al. [2002]) had been found in the X[*]+[*] 3 centromere region of Indian muntjac.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>cervid</b> species in which CWD is known to naturally occur, Black-tailed deer and European red deer have been clinically demonstrated to be naturally susceptible to CWD. Other <b>cervid</b> species, including reindeer and caribou, are also suspected to be naturally vulnerable to this disease. Many other non-cervid mammalian species have been experimentally infected with CWD, either orally or via intracerebral inoculation. These species include monkeys, sheep, cattle, prairie voles, mice, and ferrets.|$|R

30|$|In this study, we {{made use}} of Indian muntjac with the very large centromeric/pericentromeric region of {{chromosome}} X[*]+[*] 3 for our investigation into the possible existence of ancient centromeric DNAs.

The newly isolated satellite DNA (designated as <b>cervid</b> satellite VI) is organized as 11 -bp monomer tandem repeats.

40|$|Experimental {{obstacles}} have impeded {{our ability}} to study prion transmission within and, more particularly, between species. Here, we used <b>cervid</b> prion protein expressed in brain extracts of transgenic mice, referred to as Tg(CerPrP), as a substrate for in vitro generation of chronic wasting disease (CWD) prions by protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA). Characterization of this infectivity in Tg(CerPrP) mice demonstrated that serial PMCA resulted in the high fidelity amplification of CWD prions with apparently unaltered properties. Using similar methods to amplify mouse RML prions and characterize the resulting novel <b>cervid</b> prions, we show that serial PMCA abrogated a transmission barrier that required several hundred days of adaptation and subsequent stabilization in Tg(CerPrP) mice. While both approaches produced <b>cervid</b> prions with characteristics distinct from CWD, the subtly different properties of the resulting individual prion isolates indicated that adaptation of mouse RML prions generated multiple strains following inter-species transmission.

40|$|Abstract Several <b>cervid</b> remains have {{recently}} been discovered in the sandy, red-coloured and strongly cemented sediment filling the uppermost cavity of the Su Fossu de Cannas Cave (Sadali, central-eastern Sardinia), cut into the Mesozoic limestone in the Barbagia of Seulo. The remains {{were found on the}} ceiling of a narrow, horizontal underground cave. The origin of this passage may be due to an ancient erosional phase (Middle Pleistocene?), which affected the sediments formerly filling up the cave, as evidenced by the erosion of the uppermost conglomerate and by the further deposition of reddish, slightly cemented sediments. The specimens analysed thus far show close morphological affinities with the endemic Sardinian megacerine “Praemegaceros” cazioti (Depéret, 1897). However, the Sadali <b>cervid</b> differs from the latter in its larger size, exceeding the range of variability calculated for the endemic species, and in some morphological features (such as the depth and curved corpus mandibulae), as well as in its proportionally smaller teeth and, notably, its elongated, slender metacarpal. The peculiar features of the Sadali specimens suggest its attribution to a new species. Nevertheless, for the moment, we prefer to name the Sadali <b>cervid</b> “Praemegaceros” n. sp., awaiting new data to present the diagnosis. The Su Fossu de Cannas <b>cervid</b> can be regarded as the most primitive representative of the genus “Praemegaceros” in Sardinia and the ancestor of the endemic species “Praemegaceros” caziot...|$|R

The main origin of CWD to Norway is still unknown, whereas importation of infected deer was the contamination source in South Korea. Norway has strict legislation and rules not allowing importation of live animals and <b>cervids</b> into the country.

25|$|In 1960’s, {{a number}} of F. magna {{outbreaks}} in <b>cervids</b> were reported {{in some areas of}} former Czechoslovakia. The prevalence of infection varied from 70 to 80% in red deer and maximum parasite burden was 144 worms. In addition, sudden deaths were documented in free or game ranging deer. The highest mortality was reported in free ranging roe deer in Písek County in the South Bohemia of former Czechoslovakia. In the same region, moreover, the parasite was found in livers of slaughtered cattle. Erhardová-Kotrlá (1971) confirmed red deer, fallow deer and roe deer as main definitive hosts of F. magna in Europe. In 1960’s, F. magna was enzootic in former Czechoslovakia in following four major areas: (1) České Budějovice and Třeboň county, including Nové Hrady Mountains; (2) the area along the Vltava River on the Vltava-Týn hills near Hluboká and Bechyně; (3) Písek and Milevsko county; (4) the Brdy mountains and the Hřebeny mountains. In following years, F. magna was only reported from these areas. Recently, geographical distribution of F. magna in <b>cervids</b> was determined in the Czech Republic. The giant liver fluke was confirmed in the same areas as reported in 1960’s. However, seven new endemic areas of F. magna were discovered suggesting that the parasite is spreading in the Czech Republic. Moreover, the appearance of F. magna in the Šumava Mountains has epizootiological importance due to possibility of spread of the parasite into the German territory (Bavaria). During the last few years, a new European enzootic area has established in the Danube watershed in Central Europe. In 1988, F. magna was isolated from a 3-year old red deer female found dead near the Gabčíkovo water plant at the Danube River in Slovakia. The parasite has spread through whole Slovakian Danube watershed.|$|E
25|$|Dead-end hosts are {{represented}} by large bovids, suids, llamas, horses and some Old World <b>cervids.</b> Infections in dead-end hosts are characterized by excessive fibrosis, thick-walled encapsulation of flukes within hepatic parenchyma, and black pigmentation of various tissues. Both afferent and efferent bile ducts are totally occluded and are marked by tracts of fibrous tissue. The eggs can not be passed into the bile system, and, therefore, the infection is not patent. In addition, flukes rarely mature in dead-end hosts probably due to strong immune response. Nevertheless, appearance of F. magna eggs in the faeces of a single experimentally infected calf has been documented. Rarely have the pathophysiology or clinical symptoms in dead-end hosts have been studied. In cattle, significant elevations of eosinophil counts in periphery blood but only slight increases of AST and GGT have been observed. While American authors have not observed any clinical symptoms in cattle, anorexia and weight loss were recorded in naturally infected bulls in the former Czechoslovakia.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The filarioid {{nematode}} Setaria tundra {{caused an}} outbreak of peritonitis in Finnish semi-domesticated reindeer in 2003 - 2006. Our research group studied the invasion and reservoirs of S. tundra in Finnish <b>cervid</b> populations and this paper {{provides an overview of}} that research. The outbreak had detrimental effects on reindeer health and may, in part, explain the observed decline of the population of wild forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus). Both range expansion by roe deer, and high summer temperatures that increased vector populations of mosquitoes and gnats and influ-enced habitat use by reindeer were implicated in the outbreak. We suggest that vector borne parasites will increase in the Arctic owing to the effect of global climate change and have consequences for all <b>cervid</b> populations.

In addition, it contained 51 regions each organized in a complex fashion, with sequences homology to intersperse repetitive sequences such as LINEs, SINEs, LTRs, other published DNA elements, and unassigned sequences. The FISH patterns of seven non-satellite sequence elements generated from the BAC clone showed mainly specific to centromeres of the Indian muntjac representing novel centromeric DNAs of the species. Furthermore, FISH signals and Southern blot patterns of these elements suggest the existence of a not yet identified repetitive sequence with giant repeated monomers. Positive FISH signals of these elements were also detected in the centromeric regions of Formosan muntjac.

25|$|Natural infections of F. magna occur {{primarily}} in <b>cervids</b> and bovids. Although many species {{are susceptible to}} infection, only a few cervid species contribute significantly to maintaining populations of the fluke. In North America, the common definitive hosts of the giant liver fluke are wapiti (Cervus elaphus canadensis), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus). In Europe, F. magna occurs commonly in red deer (Cervus elaphus), fallow deer (Dama dama) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Domestic ruminants are also susceptible to natural infection with F. magna. However, the infection is not patent, and domestic ruminants do {{not contribute to the}} propagation of the parasite in the environment. In North America, the giant liver fluke is commonly found in cattle, sheep and goats in areas where F. magna is enzootic in deer. In contrast, F. magna occurs rarely in domestic ruminants in Europe.

25|$|Boars of {{all ages}} were once the primary prey of tigers in Transcaucasia, Kazakhstan, Middle Asia and the Far East up until the late 19th century. In modern times, tiger numbers are too low to have a {{limiting}} effect on boar populations. A single tiger can systematically destroy an entire sounder by preying on its members one by one, {{before moving on to}} another herd. Tigers have been noted to chase boars for longer distances than with other prey. In two rare cases, boars were reported to gore a small tiger and a tigress to death in self-defense. In the Amur region, wild boars are one of the two most important prey species for tigers alongside the Manchurian wapiti, with the two species collectively comprising roughly 80% of the felid's prey. In Sikhote Alin, a tiger can kill 30–34 boars a year. Studies of tigers in India indicate that boars are usually secondary in preference to various <b>cervids</b> and bovids, though when boars are targeted, healthy adults are caught more frequently than young and sick specimens.|$|E
25|$|Aberrant {{hosts of}} F. magna are sheep and goats. However, {{the course of}} {{infection}} is similar in guinea pigs, rabbits, bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) that were infected experimentally. Infections in aberrant hosts are characterized by excessive wandering of juvenile flukes and death of the host. Aberrant hosts die usually within 6 months post-infection and the death is associated with acute peritonitis or extensive haemorrhage caused by migrating flukes. In aberrant hosts, flukes do not mature and migrate until the host dies. Occasionally, a few flukes mature and eggs {{can be found in}} the faeces. Hepatic lesions in aberrant hosts generally include firm adhesions of the liver to the diaphragm, black pigmentation, hematomas, necroses, and haemorrhagic tracts in which juvenile flukes are located. While a lack of fibrous capsules within hepatic parenchyma has been reported by several authors, flukes in fibrous capsules have also been documented in sheep. However, the wall of the capsule is different from those found in <b>cervids</b> and large bovids. The dominant feature is a diffuse fibrosis throughout the liver and haemorrhagic migratory tracts containing erythrocytes, black pigment, and cell detritus. The liver lesions are infiltrated by eosinophils, plasma cells, and pigment-laden macrophages.|$|E

Human infections mainly derived from the latter two cycles. In Fennoscandia, the synanthropic cycle has been eliminated during the last 50 years due to changes in reindeer husbandry methods; machinery making herding dogs largely redundant.

F. magna infection of <b>cervids</b> is a considerable problem in northern part of Hungary (Szigetköz) and the southern Danubian territory in the Gemenc area. Since the autumn of 2000, F. magna {{has been found in}} Austrian territory, east of Vienna. In years 2000-2001, the prevalence of the giant liver fluke in red deer in Austrian parts of Danube (east of Vienna) was 66.7%.

During the necropsy of 459 deer livers (using Egri's method) the number of flukes per host ranged from 1 to 138 in the same period. Regarding the origin of F. magna enzootic area in the Danube River watershed, it is essential to point out that <b>cervids</b> were not introduced into these localities, neither recently nor in the past. Origin of the F. magna population in Danubian floodplain forests in Central Europe remains therefore unclear.|$|E
2500|$|For {{control of}} fascioloidosis in wild ruminants, {{successful}} application of anthelminthics in feed is necessary.

In addition, there should adequate therapeutic scope, i.e. span between therapeutic and minimal toxic dose. Therefore, only some of anthelminthics that are efficient in domestic ruminants have been tested in wild ruminants infected with F. magna. Several drugs, namely oxyclozanide, rafoxanide, albendazole, diamphenetide, closantel, clorsulon, and triclabendazole, {{have been used in}} control of F. magna infection in <b>cervids.</b> However, the results have differed between different authors. In the same way as for F. hepatica, triclabendazole seems to be the most effective against F. magna.

Unfortunately, rafoxanide in a commercial drug called Rafendazol Premix is the only registered drug for wild ruminants. Triclabendazole and others are produced as drugs for domestic animals and it can be used in free-living animals only with special permit. In some cases, {{it may be difficult to}} determine if F. magna or a different fluke such as Fasciola hepatica or Fasciola gigantica is causing pathology since all these flukes will have the same clinical signs.

Expression of E-selectin was more readily induced by lipopolysaccharide treatment in equine ECs than in human ECs and supported adhesion and activation of neutrophils, consistent with the extreme sensitivity of horses to endotoxaemia and septic shock...|$|R

Four 3 -month-old Jersey {{calves and}} three 3 -month-old Holstein calves were inoculated with <b>cervid</b> {{adenovirus}} and monitored for clinical signs until necropsied between 10 and 42 days postinoculation. The neonatal Jersey calves had received colostrum, and the Holstein calves were colostrum deprived. Preinoculation and postinoculation serum samples were tested for antibodies to the <b>cervid</b> adenovirus, bovine adenovirus type 6, bovine adenovirus type 7, and goat adenovirus type 1. Virus isolation {{was performed on}} kidney, nasal secretion, and/or lung homogenates in fetal white-tailed deer lung cells. Negatively stained preparations of feces from Jersey calves were examined weekly using an electron microscope, and weekly blood samples were collected for complete blood counts. Full necropsies were performed on all calves. A complete selection of tissues was evaluated for microscopic changes, and immunohistochemistry was performed on all tissues using a polyclonal antibody to deer adenovirus. No clinical signs were observed in the calves during the study period. Following inoculation, colostrum-deprived calves developed low antibody titers to deer adenovirus, while the Jersey calves that received colostrum did not. Calves that received colostrum had high antibody titers to bovine adenovirus type 7 and goat adenovirus type 1. No consistent gross or microscopic lesions were seen. Adenovirus was not observed in negatively stained preparations of feces. Immunohistochemistry results did not demonstrate virus in all tissues examined microscopically, and virus was not isolated from lungs, nasal secretions, and kidneys.
