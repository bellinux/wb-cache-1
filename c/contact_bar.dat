Tests were conducted with spur gears and rolling <b>contact</b> <b>bars</b> manufactured from VIM-VAR M 50 NiL and VAR and VIM-VAR AISI 9310. The gear pitch diameter was 8. 9 cm. Gear test conditions were an inlet oil temperature of 320 K, and outlet oil temperature of 350 K, a maximum Hertz stress of 1. 71 GPa, and a speed of 10000 rpm. Bench rolling element fatigue tests were conducted at ambient temperatures with a bar speed of 12, 500 rpm and a maximum Hertz stress of 4. 83 GPa. The VIM-VAR M 50 NiL gears had a surface fatigue life that was 4. 5 and 11. 5 times that for VIM-VAR and VAR AISI 9310 gears, respectively. The surface fatigue life of the VIM-VAR M 50 NiL rolling <b>contact</b> <b>bars</b> was 13. 2 and 21. 6 times that for the VIM-VAR and VAR AISI 9310, respectively.

50|$|When the {{actuator}} is moved, {{mechanical energy}} {{is stored in}} the compression spring until the actuator passes its mid-position. At that time, the common <b>contact</b> <b>bar</b> is forced {{in the opposite direction}} by the compression spring, acting via the actuator bar, thus breaking the connection with the existing contact and making connection with the other contact. The common <b>contact</b> <b>bar</b> is made of copper, with an inlay of harder contact metal on the underside. While it is free to move the required distance lengthwise, it is constrained from moving sideways by the construction of the molded plastic body.|$|E

40|$|The heat {{sealability}} of laminated films with linear {{low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) as the sealant materials was investigated. A laboratory heat sealer was used to study the response of laminated films to temperature, time, and pressure. Platen temperature was confirmed as primary factor in controlling heat-seal strength. Dwell time must be sufficiently long to bring the interfacial temperature to a desired level. When the desired heat-seal strength has been achieved, further increase of dwell time did not improved heat-seal strength. Platen pressure had little effect above the level required to flatten the materials for good <b>contact.</b> <b>Bar</b> sealing process window for each sample were developed. The optimum combination of platen temperature and dwell time for each laminated film can be obtained in the respective process windows. Strength of heat-seal and its failure modes are closely related. Plateau initiation temperature closely corresponds to the final melting point of sealant materials. Relatively higher platen temperature was required to seal laminated films with lower thermal conductance. Required dwell time corresponds closely to the heat flow rate of bar sealing process. Laminated films made from extrusion lamination process provided lower level of achievable heat seal strength when compared with the laminated films made from dry-bond lamination proces...|$|E
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the validity of a new system for assessing the displacement and average velocity within machine-based resistance training exercise using the Chronojump System. The new design {{is based on a}} <b>contact</b> <b>bar</b> and a simple, low-cost mechanism that detects the conductivity of electrical potentials with a precision chronograph. This system allows coaches to assess velocity to control the strength training process. A validation study was performed by assessing the concentric phase parameters of a leg press exercise. Output time data from the Chronojump System in combination with the pre-established range of movement was compared with data from a position sensor connected to a Biopac System. A subset of 87 actions from 11 professional tennis players was recorded and, using the two methods, average velocity and displacement variables in the same action were compared. A t-test for dependent samples and a correlation analysis were undertaken. The r value derived from the correlation between the Biopac System and the contact Chronojump System was > 0. 94 for all measures of displacement and velocity on all loads (p < 0. 01). The Effect Size (ES) was 0. 18 in displacement and 0. 14 in velocity and ranged from 0. 09 to 0. 31 and from 0. 07 to 0. 34, respectively. The magnitude of {{the difference between the two}} methods in all parameters and the correlation values provided certain evidence of validity of the Chronojump System to assess the average displacement velocity of loads in a resistance training machin...|$|E

50|$|A {{commutator}} {{consists of}} a set of <b>contact</b> <b>bars</b> fixed to the rotating shaft of a machine, and connected to the armature windings. As the shaft rotates, the commutator reverses the flow of current in a winding. For a single armature winding, when the shaft has made one-half complete turn, the winding is now connected so that current flows through it in the opposite of the initial direction. In a motor, the armature current causes the fixed magnetic field to exert a rotational force, or a torque, on the winding to make it turn. In a generator, the mechanical torque applied to the shaft maintains the motion of the armature winding through the stationary magnetic field, inducing a current in the winding. In both the motor and generator case, the commutator periodically reverses the direction of current flow through the winding so that current flow in the circuit external to the machine continues in only one direction.|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{conductive}} adhesives are {{a promising}} alternative to common soldering technologies. Advantages are lower process temperatures (< 150 °C), meaning lower mechanical stresses, relatively simple process technology with opportunity for automation and environment-friendliness, {{since there is}} no lead and flux necessary. This paper focuses on the mechanical characterization for finite element simulation. For this purpose samples are prepared for mechanical tests to identify time and temperature dependent material properties. On the assumption of a thermo-rheological simple material, master curves are constructed and parameters for a linear-viscoelastic model are identified. Additionally the thermal expansion behavior is measured in order to obtain the opportunity to simulate temperature induced strains accurately. The material models are applied to analyze stress situations in thin film photovoltaic modules were back <b>contact</b> and cross <b>bar</b> <b>contacting</b> is done with conductive adhesive material.
