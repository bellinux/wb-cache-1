50|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{optimisation}} of the valve timing for differing engine speeds and loads, the system is able to vary the timing and duration of the inlet valve opening. It achieves this by using a complex and finely machined mechanism to drive the inlet camshafts. This mechanism can accelerate and decelerate the rotational speed of the camshaft during different parts of its cycle. e.g. to produce longer opening duration, it slows the rotation during the valve open part of the cycle and speeds it up during the valve <b>closed</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
5000|$|From these {{examples}} it also follows that probably {{there was also}} a gradual shift of meaning of the res publica concept throughout the Roman era: the [...] "(Roman) Republic" [...] connotation of res publica is something that rather occurs with retrospect to a <b>closed</b> <b>period</b> (so less appararent in Cicero's time, who never knew the era of the Emperors, and could only compare with the epoch of the Kings); on the other hand the translation of the Greek [...] "politeia" [...] concept appears to have nearly completely worn off in late antiquity.|$|E

5000|$|It is, in fact, {{doubtful}} whether closed periods {{are capable}} of encouraging attendance at matches and participation in matches. Both activities have a completely different quality to the following of a live transmission on television.

Indeed, {{there is evidence to}} refute this claim: for example, in an investigation of the closed periods under competition law the Commission found that only 10 of 22 associations had actually adopted a <b>closed</b> <b>period.</b> No closed periods were adopted in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, or in Northern Ireland, that is to say, within the sphere of influence of English football.

50|$|The gonads of the West Indian sea egg are {{traditionally}} {{consumed in the}} West Indies {{and there is an}} important fishery in Barbados. Urchins are collected by skin diving and it used to be possible to collect a thousand in a few hours. In order to conserve stocks, a <b>closed</b> <b>period</b> was introduced during the breeding season (May to August) during which no sea urchins were allowed to be taken. Despite this, sea urchin numbers have declined during the late twentieth century and they are now uncommon and the fishery non-viable. The cause of this population collapse is thought to be overfishing, though pollution and disease may have played a part. The sea urchins have become rare in the most easily fished locations and are still common in more remote places. Attempts are being made to raise urchin larvae in the laboratory and restock depleted areas.|$|E

5000|$|Pattern of {{racketeering}} activity requires {{at least}} two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity. The U.S. Supreme Court has instructed federal courts to follow the continuity-plus-relationship test {{in order to determine}} whether the facts of a specific case give rise to an established pattern. Predicate acts are related if they [...] "have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events."

Continuity is both a closed and open ended concept, referring to either a <b>closed</b> <b>period</b> of conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.|$|E
5000|$|Viardo {{studied with}} Irina Naumova at the Gnessin State Musical College and later studied with Lev Naumov at the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory where he {{remained}} {{as a student}} for six years. Naumov would describe him as [...] "my number one pupil". During this time, he was tenured as a soloist by Moscow Philharmonia (the primary music organization of the USSR). After obtaining a doctorate, he was immediately engaged as assistant professor with Naumov at the Conservatory. At 21 Viardo took the third prize and the Prix du Prince Rainier at the Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud Competition, and in 1973 first prize at the Van Cliburn International Competition. He had already launched an impressive global career when his travel visa was mysteriously revoked. For nearly thirteen years, Viardo was a virtual prisoner of the Iron Curtain. During this <b>closed</b> <b>period,</b> he developed new horizons in his artistic achievements, vastly enlarging his repertoire, eventually including 37 concertos. Only when Mikhail Gorbachev rose to power in the Soviet Union was freedom to travel restored, and in 1987 Viardo was permitted to accept engagements in Germany and in the United States.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, the Bowlers Bar {{was built}} along with six indoor bowls rinks, in {{addition}} to the two original rinks built in the 1980's. Ten Pin bowling was added in 1994 but it was between 1996 and 1998 that the resort's main facilities would be changed for the long term future. The Bamboo Bar was knocked down and replaced by the Terrace Bar, The Gallery Lounge and International Arena (with a further six bowls rinks) was opened and, during the resort's <b>closed</b> <b>period</b> in 1996 and 1997 respectively, the old theatre and restaurant were knocked down, replaced by the Atlas Theatre in 14 weeks, and the Garden Restaurant in 12 weeks. The sport of bowls became a key part of Potters' eventual year round success, with thousands of retired holidaymakers enjoying the combination of this social sport whilst holidaying in the typically quieter seasons. As Potters' link with bowls grew, so did their investment in the sport and subsequently their relationship with the World Bowls Tour. In 1999 the resort hosted the World Indoor Bowls Championships for the first time, having moved from its long standing home in Preston. The event remains at Potters to this day with many thousands from the world over flocking to Hopton-on-Sea for 17 days in January. 1999 would also see the first year that Potters Resort was open all year round and the opening of the Hotel with 86 rooms.|$|E
