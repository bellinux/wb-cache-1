30|$|As anticipated, the {{financing}} pillar contains other indicators as well, which {{would contribute to}} understanding whether there are equity measures in place. The Eurydice report (2014) lists three indicators {{with regard to the}} affordability of ECEC services: the average out-of-pocket <b>childcare</b> <b>expense</b> for parents, the type of financial support available to parents and the criteria to offer fee reductions. Yet, none of these indicators qualifies for usage in statistical analysis. The first indicator is not standardised across countries (some provide data as average and some provide the range of fees). The countries vary too much in the second one, where quite many of them do not provide data at all. Finally, the last one demonstrates that most countries take multiple measures in determining whether a fee reduction is needed—which becomes irrelevant if the country provides the services free of charge. Better indicators are needed to dive deeper into the effect of financing of ECEC on the perceived accessibility of these services.|$|R
5000|$|Beth Symes [...] Queen's University alumna is a Canadian {{lawyer who}} fought the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA, {{formerly}} known as Revenue Canada) {{all the way to}} the Supreme Court of Canada in order to deduct <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> she incurred to earn income as a partner in her law firm. Symes practised law full-time as a partner in a law firm from 1982-1985. During that period she employed a nanny to care for her children, and deducted the wages paid to the nanny as a business expense on her personal income tax return. Revenue Canada initially allowed these deductions, but later disallowed them. Symes objected to the re-assessment, but CRA denied the objection. Symes appealed to the Federal Court, which ruled that the expenses were valid and legitimate business expenses. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), which ruled in Symes v. Canada 1993 that her <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> were not deductible as business expenses.|$|E

30|$|As {{discussed}} above, the childcare support projects {{undertaken by}} the Korean Government {{over the past four}} years are 1) the enhancement of the access to childcare facilities, 2) the alleviation of household burden incurred from <b>childcare</b> service <b>expenses,</b> and 3) the reinforcement of quality of childcare service. These three projects are childcare policy tasks pursued not only by Korea, but also commonly pursued by other nations which require childcare support policies.

50|$|Single {{mothers are}} faced with a number of {{challenges}} primarily resulting from low income. On average, single parents account for between 15 and 40% of income inequality, earning an estimated average of $32,597, less than half of what the average married couple earns. Women's incomes on average are lower than men's due to “occupational segregation”. These statistics indicate that a vast number of single-parent children grow up in poverty. Studies have shown children growing up in poverty are 66% less likely to rise out of poverty. Single mothers, although working long strenuous hours at these low-paying jobs, are still unable to cope with the financial burden of childcare. With the burden of single-motherhood becoming more and more of a prevalent issue, one would think that it would begin to be taken into serious consideration by the public. However, progress toward gender integration has slowed, <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> are on the rise, housing isn’t getting any cheaper and health care is still expensive.|$|E
30|$|The total SA benefit {{consists}} of two parts.

30|$|However, {{contrary}} to expectations, the positive relationships between subsidized childcare cost and both {{job satisfaction and}} organizational commitment were not supported. Support for <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> is usually taken by young workers with {{a child who is}} less than three years old. Compared to other benefits, there are relatively few employees who benefit from the <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> provided by the companies. Only 198 respondents, which are 6.8 % of the sample, are eligible to apply for <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses.</b> This is relatively low, compared with the number of respondents who can apply for the other FFPs such as paid leave (1, 268) and sick leave (1, 174). If the relationships between <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> and either job satisfaction or organizational commitment were investigated in organizations in which employees with young children work, different results may be reported.|$|E

40|$|In Belgium, {{families}} with young dependents receive tax reliefs {{depending on the}} type of care used.

Then we construct a calibrated stochastic dynamic life-cycle model of household decision-making designed to capture some facts about labor supply in Germany. We find that the welfare gains associated with subsidizing childcare are considerable, and that the maximum gains are realized when childcare is subsidized to an even greater extent than what tax deductibility implies...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{federal income tax}} {{treatment}} of employment-related child care expenses. It takes both a theoretical and historical approach, examining the various {{ways in which the}} Code has dealt with child care in relation to conventional tax notions and values at play in the community at large. Part II outlines the history of the Code 2 ̆ 7 s various childcare provisions. It is a critical analysis whose purpose is to decide whether any of the provisions, which have existed, can be explained by a particular tax theory. Part III asks whether employment-related <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> can be characterized as 2 ̆ 2 business 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 personal 2 ̆ 2 expenses. This question is asked in the hope that it can reveal what the proper tax treatment of employment-related <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> should be. Would the exclusion of such costs be a refinement of the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s income or just another loophole? The issue of the imputed income of home production is taken up in part IV. Should a deduction for childcare and household services be allowed so as to provide tax neutrality between wage work and housework? Part V takes a second run through the history developed in part II. This time, however, the emphasis is sociological. I explore whether our reasons for preferring one child care provision over another, or over none at all, are more a product of underlying values regarding work and family than adherence to tax theory. Finally, in part VI, the author discusses what type of childcare provision he thinks the Code should have in light of what he has presented in the paper...|$|E
30|$|This {{paper has}} {{outlined}} the policy directions and major projects undertaken {{in a positive}} way, which {{are considered to be}} meaningful childcare and early childhood education policies. However, the assessment {{on the part of the}} general public on childcare policy is not as positive. Despite the high <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> incurred by the general public, parents are not fully satisfied with the quality of service they receive. The inequity between the private and public sectors remains as a poignant focus of social conflict. Some are skeptical as to the effects of the four-fold increase in the childcare support budget over the past four years. This sentiment stems from a lack of trust in transparency in supporting and operating childcare centers and kindergartens.|$|E
30|$|However, {{there were}} also certain {{elements}} of the childcare systems in these two provinces that conformed to an inclusive liberal model of ECEC. Both provinces had mandatory full-day kindergarten for 5 -year-olds, used an early development instrument during kindergarten, and provided operating grants to childcare centers to accommodate children with special needs. While roughly one third of provincial ECEC funding still went towards parental subsidies, this percentage was dropping as these two provincial governments had decided to eschew tax credits for <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> and to provide more direct funding to regulated centers. As illustrated in Table  1, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick had provincial government spending that was lower, but comparable, to that of PEI and had a moderate availability of regulated childcare spaces for 0 - to 5 -year-olds by Canadian standards.|$|E

Six family-friendly programs were included in this study: paid leave, sick leave, childcare leave, partial payment of <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses,</b> partial payment of family events (marriage, funeral, etc.), and support for housing (mortgage loan, etc.). The availability of FFPs was assessed by surveying individuals with questions such as “Are you entitled to receive to paid leave?” and “Are you entitled to receive childcare expenses?” Respondents were asked to answer ‘yes’ if they can apply to a certain family-friendly program and ‘no’ if they cannot, or the respondent answered “I don’t know”. The responses were dummy coded into 0 [*]=[*]no and 1 [*]=[*]yes.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the economic and}} non-economic returns to volunteering for prime-aged women. A woman's decision to engage in unpaid work, and to marry and have children, is formulated as a forward-looking discrete choice dynamic programming problem. Simulated maximum likelihood estimates of the model indicate that an extra year of volunteer experience increases wage offers in part-time work by 8. 3 % and wage offers in full-time work by 2. 4 %. The behavioral model also reveals an adverse selection mechanism {{which is consistent with}} the negative returns to volunteering found in reduced-form wage regressions. The negative selection is driven by differential unobserved market-productivity and heterogeneous marginal utilities of future consumption. The structural estimates also imply that the economic returns to volunteering are relatively more important than non-economic returns, and introduction of a tax-credit for volunteering-related <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> would substantially increase volunteer labor supply and female lifetime earnings...|$|E
40|$|Part I {{considers}} the proper tax treatment of out-of-pocket parenting expenses {{such as the}} costs incurred in providing food, clothing, shelter, and other goods and services to children for their consumption.

Part II concludes that the present income tax system discriminates against all parents by failing to allow a deduction for the negative income produced by parenting and discriminates against two-worker married couples by failing to allow a more generous deduction for employment-related <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses...</b>|$|E
30|$|In South Korea, {{employees}} {{are entitled to}} take paid leaves of 15 - 25  days depending {{on the number of}} years they have worked in their current organization (the Labor Standard Acta). According to ‘Equal Employment and Work-Life Balance Protection Act’, in cases employees {{need to take care of}} their family who are sick due to accident and old age, employees can take sick leaves. Childcare leaves can be taken by either the mother or the father in order to take care of the child who is less than three years old, and do not exceed one year. Paid maternity leaves, not exceeding 90  days, are entitled to pregnant employees during their childbirth. This study, however, did not include paid maternity leave because it applies to only female employees. Another FFP is subsidized childcare cost. The purpose of this policy is to offer financial support in order to reduce the burden on their employees with <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> such as daycare or kindergarten expenses. These four programs were selected because much empirical research has paid attention to them in the Western contexts (Grover and Crooker 1995).|$|E
40|$|Today, many {{working parents}} {{are caught in}} a “childcare squeeze”: while they require two incomes just to make ends meet, they end up {{spending}} a strikingly large percentage of their income on childcare {{so that they can}} work outside the home. Worse still, some parents find themselves “squeezed out” of the market entirely, unable to earn the additional income their families require because they cannot find jobs that pay enough to offset soaring <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses.</b> This Article argues that the tax laws have {{played an important role in}} aggravating these hardships. Currently, the Internal Revenue Code treats the childcare costs incurred by working parents as personal expenses, subject to various dollar limitations, percentage limits, and phaseouts. Once these limitations are applied, working parents will receive tax relief for only a small fraction of the childcare costs they actually incur. This Article shows that this is inappropriate as a matter of fundamental tax policy and results in the overtaxation of the working family. It then provides a blueprint for meaningful reform that would properly treat working childcare costs like other costs of earning income and keep the tax laws from worsening the working family’s economic plight...|$|E
40|$|President Obama’s “Preschool for All ” {{initiative}} {{calls for}} dramatic {{increases in the}} number of 4 year olds enrolled in public preschool programs and in the quality of these programs nationwide. The proposed program shares many characteristics with the universal preschools that have been offered in Georgia and Oklahoma since the 1990 s. This study draws together data from multiple sources to estimate the impacts of these “model ” state programs on preschool enrollment and a broad set of family and child outcomes. For lower-income children, the state programs increase the likelihood of preschool enrollment, {{the amount of time spent}} with mothers on activities such as reading, and test performance as late as eighth grade. For higher-income families, however, the programs shift children from private to public preschools, resulting in less of an impact on overall enrollment but a significant reduction in <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses,</b> and appear to have no effect on children’s test scores. There is also little evidence that the state programs increase maternal labor supply, with the exception of a possible temporary increase in employment for mothers in lower-income families.

40|$|Excerpt] This article {{examines}} weekday resource allocation decisions of married couples with a husband employed full time and with children under 18. These decisions relate, among other things, to working for pay; doing unpaid household work; purchasing {{services such as}} childcare, laundry and drycleaning, and food away from home; and eating out. Information about spending decisions {{was obtained from the}} 2009 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) and information about time use was obtained from the 2009 American Time Use Survey (ATUS). Results show that, Regardless of employment status, wives were more likely than husbands to spend time in household activities. On an average weekday, married fathers spent more time working than married mothers did, even married mothers employed full time. The proportion of families reporting <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> and the average amount spent by those reporting were highest for families with full-time working wives and lowest for families with wives not employed for pay. Consistent with other research, working-wife families did not spend more on housekeeping and laundry services than did families with wives not employed for pay.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of a study about the {{perceptions}} of women who have returned to work after taking a career break due to family responsibilities (women returners). Most of the women who participated in the study believed that their career breaks and ongoing family commitments had adversely affected their careers. The participants also believed that, because of the skills they had acquired through their roles as caregivers and home managers, they were better employees. However, not all of the women valued those skills themselves, and many believed that their employers did not recognise them either. The study also found that women returners have various needs that, if not met, become barriers to their ability to be involved in paid work. The two most commonly reported needs were reduced hours and flexi-time. Good quality and affordable childcare, understanding from managers and colleagues, and a change in societal attitudes that equate time spent at work with ability and commitment were also important needs of women returners. Conclusions that arose suggest that employers should change policies and train managers and those involved in the recruitment and selection process {{to meet the needs of}} women returners. This will increase the organisation's ability to develop creative solutions that will support the needs of both the organisation and its employees. Furthermore, the government needs to consider the implementation of paid parental leave and allowing all <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> to be claimed against earnings. Through implementing these suggestions, mothers will have more choice about when they return to work, allowing them to better meet their own needs as well as those of their families...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposed to}} examine the relationship between support services, poverty, stability, and the quality of education received from homeless children in a large metropolitan school district. Every night anywhere from 68, 000 to over a million children go to sleep homeless in America. Of the total number of homeless people in the nation, families comprise almost one-third of this number and is the fastest growing segment of the homeless population. Additionally, this segment of homelessness is headed by women with at least two children below the age of six years. The homeless population in America, has grown exponentially; yet there are no shelters for women and children in this county. Various faith-based, non-profit organizations have come to the aid of homeless families; however, many are over 1 extended due to the large number of families who are without a shelter, food, and clothing. Nevertheless, the county 2 ̆ 7 s refusal to acknowledge the existence of this phenomenon has prompted a surge among numerous organizations to take action until the county government respond to the outcry of the homeless. This study reveals how the lack of support services, poverty, and stability contribute to whether or not a child receives a quality education. The literature reviews and results from interviews with ten homeless women and four representatives from the school district, local school, and a community organization provide more insight into the lives and daily struggle of children and their families who are destitute. The major themes that emerged were lack of support services, affordable housing, <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses,</b> a need for case workers, and a need for shelters or assessment centers. The conclusion is that there is a strong correlation between factors associated with educating homeless children and the receipt of a quality education. Children can not focus on receiving a quality education if they are hungry, unkempt, and tired...|$|E

Overall enrollment for Fall 2009 increased 5. 75 % including 5. 7 % for new freshmen, 30 % for new transfers with large growth in non-residents. • Expanded our communication capacity by purchasing Hobson's EMT E-Mail software {{that allows us to}} communicate more frequently and effectively with all students. A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution has also been purchased and will be automating communications in Fall 2009. • Developed email letterhead prototype for all enrollment units. • Re-engineered the admissions office to allow for more accountability and productivity of staff and service level. • Set service level expectations for admissions to two working days. We are now committed to communicating with students within two working days of receipt of documents. • Re-engineered the financial aid process and reduced the number of forms required. This resulted in 7, 000 less pieces of paper students had to submit and be processed. We no longer require verification of <b>childcare</b> <b>expenses</b> as we will be using average cost of child care. Driver's license number is no longer required for the F AFSA form. No forms needed for second bachelors degree as we can retrieve this information through Banner. No need for graduation date change form as it can be pulled from Banner. • Established a Communications Center that will handle all incoming calls for the entire division as well as provide telecounseling efforts in the evening. Additionally, the Center will house "Chat With Us" initiative allows students to engage with us by way of online chat. The result is phone calls answered in a timely manner and a student friendly virtual environment to conduct business. • Rolled out "How Can We Help You" campaign during Fall registration. This campaign is ongoing during every registration period where staff are deployed to assist students with their registration questions.
