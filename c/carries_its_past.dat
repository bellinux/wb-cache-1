50|$|The {{fragmentation}} of Mount Carmel caused a schism in the already permanently splintered Davidian Seventh Day Adventist Movement. Some post-Carmel Davidian groups have also named their headquarters Mount Carmel Center {{and seek to}} <b>carry</b> on <b>its</b> <b>past</b> traditions. Davidians based in Salem, South Carolina use the name, {{as well as a}} group that broke away from them, in Mountaindale, New York. Some of the Mountaindale Davidians came to believe that Victor Houteff never wanted to abandon Old Mt. Carmel, and in the early 1990s moved back to Waco. They established themselves in a building on Mt. Carmel Drive, constructed by Houteff's Davidians. They are {{across the street from the}} Vanguard School, a prep school whose buildings were also originally built by the Davidians. Other Davidian groups believe that Mount Carmel represented a doctrinal era in the Davidian Seventh Day Adventist Movement, an era which is now past.|$|R
5000|$|Molecules {{with high}} enough velocity, which escape into outer space, are ionized by solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation. As {{the solar wind}} encounters the obstacle formed by the ions, it is slowed and diverted, possibly forming a shock wave upstream of Pluto. The ions are [...] "picked up" [...] by the solar wind and <b>carried</b> in <b>its</b> flow <b>past</b> the dwarf planet to form an ion or plasma tail. The Solar Wind around Pluto (SWAP) instrument on the New Horizons spacecraft made the first measurements of this region of low-energy atmospheric ions shortly after its closest approach on 14 July 2015. Such measurements will enable the SWAP team to determine {{the rate at which}} Pluto loses its atmosphere and, in turn, will yield insight into the evolution of the Pluto’s atmosphere and surface.|$|R

5000|$|A causal loop, in {{the context}} of time travel or the causal {{structure}} of spacetime, is a sequence of events (actions, information, objects, people) in which an event is among the causes of another event, which in turn is among the causes of the first-mentioned event. Such causally-looped events then exist in spacetime, but their origin cannot be determined. A hypothetical example of a causality loop is given of a billiard ball striking <b>its</b> <b>past</b> self: the billiard ball moves in a path towards a time machine, and the future self of the billiard ball emerges from the time machine before <b>its</b> <b>past</b> self enters it, giving <b>its</b> <b>past</b> self a glancing blow, altering the past ball's path and causing it to enter the time machine at an angle that would cause its future self to strike <b>its</b> <b>past</b> self the very glancing blow that altered its path.|$|R
